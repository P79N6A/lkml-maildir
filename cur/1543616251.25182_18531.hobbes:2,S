When booting Linux, the kernel messages are shown on
screen. 
I don't like to show these messages, so  "Support for
console on virtual terminal" and "Support for console
on serial port" are not chose when compiling kernel.
But using the new kernel, computer can't boot. If one
of "Support for console on virtual terminal" and
"Support for console on serial port" is chose,
Computer can be booted. If I don’t like the booting
messages shown through terminal or HyperTerminal on
screen. Would you like to tell me how could I do?
