In my opinion, options like that should be called "Generic Hermes
chipset 802.11b support".

No, there might be a reason not to have options selected which are
"required", and that needs to be possible whichever kernel

The *best* thing to do is to make the help text more helpful, because
that way it explains the configuration to the user, instead of just
doing it for them.
