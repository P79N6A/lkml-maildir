Maybe not in this hypothetical future situation, but currently makefile
magic was added for crc32 specifically to ensure that it is linked
in when needed... even when CONFIG_CRC32=n.
The Config.in for crc32 only exists for the case where no driver in the
built kernel uses it... but a 3rd party module might want it.
