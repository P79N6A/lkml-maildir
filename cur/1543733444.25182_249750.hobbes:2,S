Gcc3.4.1 has recently been complaining of a number of unused results 
from function with attribute warn_unused_result set. I'm not sure of how 
you want to tackle this so I'm avoiding posting patches. Should we 
remove the attribute (seems the likely option) or set some dummy 
variable (sounds stupid now that I ask it).
