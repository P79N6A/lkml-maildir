I have no complete overview. I know that Motorola actually removed that 
instruction in the M68060 (it causes an emulation trap) and it's still not 
back in newer ColdFire cpus. For arm it's an optional instruction in 
earlier versions (v3). For ppc it's splitted into two instructions.
For the rest you might want to check <asm/div64.h>, if div64 has to be 
emulated, there are good chances this instruction has to be emulated as 
well (especially in smaller embedded archs).
bye, Roman
