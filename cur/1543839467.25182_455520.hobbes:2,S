OK, but please see "atomic 0 order allocation failure" below.

I don't care much about swap-over-network, Peter does.  I care about
reliable remote disks in general, and reliable nbd in particular.

Earlier, I wrote: "we need to actually fix the out of memory
deadlock/performance bug right now so that remote storage works
properly."  It is actually far more likely that memory reclaim stuffups
will cause TCP to drop block IO packets here and there than that we
will hit some endless retransmit deadlock.  But dropping packets and
thus causing TCP stalls during block writeout is a very bad thing too,
I do not think you could call a system that exhibits such behavior a
particularly reliable one.
So rather than just the word deadlock, let us add "or atomic 0 order
alloc failure during TCP receive" to the challenge.  Fair?
On the client send side, Peter already showed an easily reproducable
deadlock which we avoid by using elevator-noop.  The bug is still
there, it is just under a different rock now.

Daniel
