I know, and that's what I was pointing out to the person I was
replying to - reread his comments and you'll see that the current
design of khttpd (at least as he specified it) would happily have
taken x?y as a filename if such a file happenned to have existed.
I therefore repeat the claim I made, which is that any web server
seeing a URL with a ? in it MUST assume that the URL in question
references a dynamic file.
However, you've brought up a point that I'd certainly overlooked, and
I suspect Arjan had as well, which is the %xx notation for certain
characters in filenames.
Arjan: Allowing for those sequences, the correct handling of URL's
as far as khttpd is concerned would be similar to the enclosed shell
script, at least as I understand it.
Best wishes from Riley.
