C1 is a power-saving mode - if your CPU is pegged, you won't be in any
C state (the acpi code seems to make this confusing by showing you the
last mode you were in - however, the usage count won't change). If the
C2 latency isn't significantly larger than the C1 latency, I don't think
there's ever any reason to want to use C1.
To further confuse things, the ipw2100 driver will silently disable
anything higher than C2 if it ever receives a corrupt packet. I'm not
convinced this is a good thing.
