Subject: linux-2.3.51 symbios 53c875 parity errors
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

i booted up linux-2.3.51 and noticed i was getting scsi parity errors
when i use lspci -vvvxxx.  i've got a pair of symbios 8751sp cards.  i
did not notice this happening with earlier kernels.  it does not
happen with linux-2.2.14.  with the devel kernels, i was using
pci=peer until recently and am now using pci=biosirq.  i do not know
if that has anything to do with it.
the two cards share an irq.  they've been doing so happily for about 6
months through various devel kernels.
included is an excerpt from /var/log/messages.  the machine didn't crash
and appeared to keep on chugging.  the error messages worry me though.
i've also included the output from lspci when running linux-2.3.51 in
case that helps.
