Yes, I don't call suspend for it because I can be sure the drivers are
idle (before beginning to write the image, freeze all process, flush all
dirty buffers and suspend all other drivers, I then wait on my own I/O
until it is flushed too). I know it's broken to do so, but it was a good
work around for wearing out the thing by spinning it down and then
immediately spinning it back up, and I wasn't sure what the right state
to try to put it in is (sound familiar?!). If you want to tell me how I
could tell it to quiesce without spin down, I'll happily do that.
The sooner these issues get sorted, the better.
Regards,
Nigel
