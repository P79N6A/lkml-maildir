Subject: LFS (2+GB) problems.

Just resently I have started messing with the lfs facilities now
in place in the devel kernels and I have run into a few problems.
A bit of info on what I had to do to get the stuff to work (not problems
just general info)
	o Install new glibc 2.1.3 snapshot (previous versions didnt know of
	  stat64 syscall?)
	o Rebuilt fileutils to try and fix a problem 
	  (see below it didnt fix anything unfortunately.)
	o I ran the try-lfs program to create a file it maxed out at 4TB.
	  This seems ok?
Here are my problems:
	o I can create files larger than 4GB BUT I cannot remove them cleanly.
	o On a reboot e2fsck truncates any file larger than 4GB to 4GB.
I am not sure if these are userspace or kernel space problems... But I do know
that I now have a fully LFS aware rm... (I recompiled fileutils.) and it still 
doesnt seem to work.  However it definately looks like somewhere a 32Bit 
number is being coerced into a 64Bit one...  esp since 4GB is exactly 2^32...
Also... the first time I ran e2fsck it complained to me about having a large
file on the FS... It said I needed to turn on some flag in the superblock
(I cant remember the name) to enable LFS support... How do I turn it on 
if e2fsck didnt already?  What is the flag named?  Is there any real docs
on how to set up LFS in linux?  I cant seem to find any.
Any help in this issue greatly appreciated!
