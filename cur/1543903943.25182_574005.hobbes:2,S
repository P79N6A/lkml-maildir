bug!  The rhs will get truncated befire it gets assigned to
the lhs.  Need to cast page->index to loff_t.
I'll fix this one up.  Please review the other patches for this?
I decided to merge this ahead of that great pile of Nick's patches
(pagecache write deadlocks) and gto a number of easy-to-fix rejects as a
result.  Hopefully it all landed OK.
