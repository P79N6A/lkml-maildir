ACPI is turned on. As I have no experience with what SMI mode is, or how
it could be entered, is there a way to figure that out? When that BUG
happens the system is running one of our tests which involves lots of
calls to gettimeofday and/or clock_gettime on all cores, all being
constantly under 100% cpu usage. There does not seem to be anything
notable different in that situation.

The systems all do not have HPET unfortunately. Using the timesource
"jiffies" is the worst fallback (giving HZ resolution), I assume thats
driven by PIT. Using pmtimer is also a suboptimal choice, as its takes
(depending on the system) between 8 and 12 times more time than the tsc
based calls, which sometimes gets into 2µs per call, much more than the
optimal resolution of <1µs, and that also gets some apps to use
significant more CPU for the timer calls, as an example one of our proxy
apps needs to check timeouts of internal data very very often and on the
bad pmtimer machines it spends up to 40% in the gettimeofday calls.

Ok, I hope you won't get angry if I try to get an official statement
from AMD about this, it seems a bit strange to me ;)
Anyways, I got some time-warp-test.c program written by Ingo Molnar
which should check TSC synchronity on the CPUs. Running that program for
a while (30 minutes) did not lead to any negative results. Does anyone
have experiences with this program, and under what conditions it should
be run? and how long?

I found some patch attempts in various places, e.g. one by Suleiman
Souhlal posted on this list that try to this and similar things.
Wouldn't those patches (although seemingly suboptimal) not be better
than nothing? As I described earlier, it wouldn't be that much of a
problem to have small differences (one could try syncing the tsc every
now and then) for us, one of the main concerns (beside an "ok" accuracy)
is the performance, a variante thats 8-12 times slower is (hopefully
understandable) very suboptimal
