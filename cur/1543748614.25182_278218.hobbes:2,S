Hi,
Just FYI real-time kernels do not boot on my Fedora Devel (Rawhide)
system, including -RT-2.6.10-rc2-mm3-V0.7.32-12. 2.6.10-rc2-mm4 OTOH
boots fine. It freezes just after initial hardware init before going
into gfx mode.
(kernel config available on demand, it's almost the same - 2.6.10-rc2-
mm4 was generated using a make oldconfig on the -RT-2.6.10-rc2-mm3-
V0.7.32-12 file)
Regards,
