Dear friend,
I have a proposal for you, this however is not mandatory nor will I 
in any manner compel you to honour against your will. I am Mr Johnson Emeka, and work with a bank (one of the African leading banks in the West Coast). Here in this bank existed a dormant account for the past 8 years which belong to a American national who is now late Mr Morris Thompson who died on Alaska Airlines Flight 261 More details about the deceased himself,you can check on 
http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html
 
When I discovered that there had been no deposits nor withdrawals 
from this account for this long period, I decided to carry out a 
system investigation and discovered that non of the family member nor relations of the late person is aware of this account. This is the story in a nutshell. 
Now I want an account overseas where the bank will transfer this 
funds.Thereafter, I had planned to destroy all related documents for this account. It is a careful network and for the past eleven months 
I have worked out everything to ensure a hitch-free operation. 
The amount is not so much at the moment and plus all the accumulated interest the balance in this account stands at-(US$7.5 million US dollars). Now my questions are:-
1. Can you handle this project?
2. Can I give you this trust?
3. What will be your commission?
If you can sponsor this transfer. Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible. Finally, it is our humble prayer that the 
information as contained herein be accorded the necessary attention, 
urgency as well as the secrecy it deserves. I Expect your urgent 
response if you can handle this project.Please contact me on my 
priavat email box only.confirmation. I am expecting your urgent response as soon as you 
receive my message.
Respectfully yours,
Mr Johnson Emeka
