Well its seems that we have different interpretations of what was agreed 
on. My understanding was that the large blocksize patchset was okay 
provided that I supply an acceptable mmap implementation and put a 
warning in.

Well even without slab targeted reclaim: Mel's antifrag will sort the 
dentries into separate blocks of memory and so isolate the issue.
