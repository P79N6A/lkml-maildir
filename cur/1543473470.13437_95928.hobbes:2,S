Allen,
I'll second the nomination.  Your work has always looked clean and well
thought-out to my eyes.  Rest assured, if there are any gremlins lurking
in the kernel nfsd I will trip over them - and quickly.  I make up in
"feature-finding" ability what I lack in raw hacking skills <g>.
You'd be a good candidate.  Hope Linus concurs!
Steve
