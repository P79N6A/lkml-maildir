You always create  joe-nonet one when you create joe
Now writing to joe's files: you can either use ACLs or do everything
through group accesses (it's very common to have a "joe" group for this
purpose for each user) 
But perhaps it's a good idea to not allow writing to all of Joe's
files by those "no network" processes too. It at least sounds like 
that might be useful to combine.

No you can't. But is that really your requirement? Why limiting Unix
sockets and not e.g. named pipes? Unix sockets do not talk to the network.
I suppose I don't understand your requirements very well.

You always define static ones at system boot. 
It would probably not scale to a lot of users, but I understand you're
talking about the OLPC which probably only has a limited set of users?
Even on a true multiuser system it could be done in a PAM module.

Your arguments don't seem very convincing to me, but 
the big problem is more the control of incoming packets. I think
it would be possible to fix OWNER match to support the INPUT chain
though.
