   You mentioned rsync to replicate the archive and then use CSSC.  Would
   be fine with me.  But: knowing how to set up rsync would probably
   require me to look at all the bk infrastructure and mechanisms more than
   I had to do in the whole time I was using bk the check out sources and
   while doing this I probably once again violate your license.
Not true, you just take the entire tree (like a tarball) and then run
SCCS get on it.
