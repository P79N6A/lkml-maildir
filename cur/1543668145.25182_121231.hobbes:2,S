I've seen that, er, scenario, too.
I should have fixed it last night, but I had other things to do.
Can['t] you just mess around with (depending on distro, not kernel)
something like /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ethN (just rename
one of them so that it won't be used)?
This should totally disable half of the dual NIC.  Do you want to only
disable dhcp on half of it, but keep it usable otherwise?
You can edit ./ifcfg-ethN and change the line
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
to
BOOTPROTO=
Something like that should work, but I haven't done it yet.
