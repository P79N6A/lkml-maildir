Hey, look. I can only warn. You do what you want. As far as I'm
concerned support stopped at Linux 2.4.19 when poll got trashed.
Nobody can use 2.4.19 or probably anything later unless they have
powerful CPUs that can spin with 1000 SIGPOLL signals per second.
Like you have said, that's the nature of free software.
