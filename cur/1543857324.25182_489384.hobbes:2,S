Yeah, I can see that the reboot might be a bit drastic for mainline.  I 
think the fallback to classic behaviour might work okay.
Anyway, the chances of hitting that case are likely pretty slim.  The 
way we've been using this is to only set the threshold for fairly 
important long-lived daemons.  Much of the "standard" stuff (shell, cat, 
cp, mv, etc.) is left unprotected.
