That's encouraging, I think, but not for 2.6.24.

I don't mind the cpufreq changing (actually, I want it to drop in cpugfreq
to save power and keep the fan off), but the C-states just kill this app.
The app is VMware.  I force the max_state=1 when launching,
and restore it to (prior value) 8 when it exits.
Makes a *huge* difference for text input and the like.
Yes, there's something there that could get fixed in the app,
and maybe one day will get fixed.  But I'm not holding my breath.
I think it manages to resonate at exactly the harmonic required that
the chip transitions to C?? just prior to the app wanting to wake up 
and do another poll.  Just kills it.
I'm not sure about C?? -- it could be C8 or even be C2 or whatever.
I suppose I should find out, but that really takes a lot of fuss (hours)
to measure, and isn't strictly repeatable.
