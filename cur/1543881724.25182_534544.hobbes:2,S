Unlike "nosuid" and "nodev", I don't think "noexec" has real security
benefits.

Oh, I don't think that matters.  For traditional /etc/fstab based user
mounts, mount(8) will have to remain suid-root, the kernel can't
replace the fstab check.
In fact the latest patches don't even support these "legacy" user
mounts too well: setting the owner of a mount gives not only umount
privilege, but the ability to submount.  This is not necessarily a
good thing for these kinds of user mounts.
We could add a new "nosubmount" or similar flag, to prevent
submounting, but that again would go against the simplicity of the
current approach, so I'm not sure it's worth it.
