You _might_ want to try dropping the drivers/usb tree from 2.5.x into
2.4 (and the usb files in include/linux/usb*.h too) and see what
happens.
Odds are the build process will not work, and I think some of the usbfs
changes will also not work.  But it would be interesting to see what you
found :)
So in short, I don't think that you could test out the 2.5 code on 2.4.
Is there some reason you can't run a 2.5 kernel?  Personally I run it on
lots of different machines (laptops, desktops, servers, etc.)
successfully.
If you can't run a 2.5 kernel, you can just take a look through the
code, and tell me what you think of that.  Readability is one of the
criteria I'm going to be using.
thanks,
