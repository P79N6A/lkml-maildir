Unfortunately Russell didn't tell us which function caused the error
and I can't seem to find a tree that matches his line numbering.
But it looks like it's shm_unlock.
The current ({0;}) seems wrong to me. I'd expect that expression to be
void. Hmm, looks like I'm wrong. It's quite ugly, not to mention confusing.
Andrew introduced it in a patch called "[PATCH] Fix shmem.c
stubs" that did this:
-#define shmem_lock(a, b) /* always in memory, no need to lock */
+#define shmem_lock(a, b, c) ({0;}) /* always in memory, no need to lock */
(shmem_lock changed from void to int a few days before this with
"rlimit-based mlocks for unprivileged users")
I didn't get compile warnings when I introduced tiny-shmem in 2004
(or, for that matter, when I wrote it in 2003) but I do seem to be
getting them now with gcc 4 -W.
So apparently gcc has gotten more picky about such things.
If we're going to start converting such things, I'd almost rather do
something like:
kernel.h:
static inline void empty_void(void) {}
static inline void empty_int(void) { return 0; }
...
mm.h:
#define shm_lock(a, b) empty_int()
The typechecking is nice in theory, but in practice I don't think it
really makes a difference for stubbing things out.
