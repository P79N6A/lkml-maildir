Yes it is possible.  Above.net is -NOT- blocking ORBS from their entire
address space, only select space.  ORBS chooses to blacklist all the
above.net space which makes it the fault of ORBS when they decree everyone
should suffer the punishment instead of the selected block.

NO.  The server is -not- blocked.  ALL of the VA servers are fully
probeable.
Read again what I wrote.  In specific, mail.linux.com has been probed by
ORBS and is listed as compliant.  The ORBS probe HAS checked it and it IS
anti-spam but it is STILL blacklisted because another section of above.net
is blocking ORBS.

No, ALL people in the above.net address space are equally affected.  NOT
just the above.net servers.

If you are a US citizen, you have the right to vote and affect legislation.
It's not a problem until it's your problem?

Someone in your neighborhood refuses to allow the nazi police to come into
their home and inspect for utility compliance.  Therefore, the utilities for
your neighborhood will be shut off.

Ok, I've said this in one of every two emails I've sent on this subject, one
more time:
   OUR SERVERS HAVE BEEN PROBED BY ORBS AND LISTED 'OK'
   THE ENIRE ABOVE.NET ADDRESS SPACE IS NOT FIREWALLING ORBS.

There is a choice.  Blacklist the "100 or so" mail servers that ORBS has
found open.  And that is from the mouth of ORBS.
The short and simple is this:  ORBS is being blocked from a group of servers
on above.net, therefore ORBS has decreed that ALL address space SWIPed by
above.net be blacklisted.
Now, since we invented automation and have this automated probe capability,
should ORBS blacklist several class B networks or should they blacklist the
individual machines?
