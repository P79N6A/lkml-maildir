Hi Serge,
Thanks for CCing me on recent CLONE_NEWUSER patches.
Would you be will to write some documentation for this flag?  (It's
the only remaining undocumented flag in clone(2).)  Plain text would
be fine -- I'll integrate it into the man page with suitable macros.
Cheers,
Michael

Subject: Current state of CLONE_NEWUSER?

Hi Serge,
What is the current status of CLONE_NEWUSER?  I'm currently trying to
test this flag in preparation for documenting it in the clone(2) man
page, but am running into an ENOMEM error from the clone() call, which
seems to occur after a failure in kobject_init_and_add() in the
following call sequence:
clone_user_ns() --> alloc_uid() --> uids_user_create() -->
kobject_init_and_add()
Are there already some test programs somewhere?  Is there any
documentation already available for this flag?
Thanks,
Michael
