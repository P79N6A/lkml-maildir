You might want to try Con Kolivas' patches on:
   
http://members.optusnet.com.au/ckolivas/kernel/
More specifically the 'swap prefetch' patch. From this FAQ:
--
Swap prefetching? If you have >10% free physical ram and any used swap it 
will start swapping pages back into physical ram. Probably not of real 
benefit but many people like this idea. I have a soft spot for it and like 
using it.
--
The disadvantage is ofcourse that you will be using up more RAM than is 
really necessary.
