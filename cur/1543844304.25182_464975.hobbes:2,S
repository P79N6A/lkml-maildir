Unless I'm missing something (a frequent occurrence) such a use of
cpusets looses on the understandable, is hobbled on the overcommit, and
has to make do with a somewhat oddly limited and not trivial to
configure approximation of the dynamic sharing.  And the
reconfiguration would seem to be a great exercise of memory hotunplug
(echos of the original motivation for fake numa - exercising cpusets ;).
Not exactly passing with flying colors ;).
