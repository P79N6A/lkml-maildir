We absolutely require that the architecture's hard_irq_disable() be defined
when we do this.  If it happens that the definition of hard_irq_disable()
is implemented three levels deep in nested includes then we risk getting
into a situation where different .c files see different implementations of
hard_irq_disable(), which could lead to confusing results, to say the least.
Your implementation comes via the inclusion of system.h which then includes
hw_irq.h.  That's perhaps a little fragile and it would be better to
a) include in the comment the name of the arch file which must implement
   hard_irq_disable() and
b) include that file directly from this one.
Oh, and your comment layout style is wrong ;)
