Why not create a new call that doesn't reset the statistic,
and change your application to invoke it instead of the call
which exists?
That's one backwards compatible way to fix things like this.
Or, you can create a new call that says "from now on, do not
reset statistics on calls using this socket."  That's another
clean, and backwards compatible way, to deal with this
kind of issue.
