Why, please? Unless you postulate that (a) the default kernel balance
would be so bad the machine wouldn't boot, or (b) that the interface would
be done only once at boot time, there's no reason for the user program to
be in initramfs, is there? Let the distribution put it where other system
things like ifconfig live.
Feel free to explain what I'm missing.

I do agree that the program would have to match the /proc if done as you
propose, but wouldn't it be better to design an interface once and then
NOT have it change? And does it belong in /proc at all, given that other
things are being moved out?
I like the idea of being able to tune the int processing with a user
program. I don't think I share your vision of making a user program part
of the kernel to allow diddling an interface which might be better getting
right the first time, and protecting against "features" being added.
Hopefully it will be minimalist, and may well benefit from a totally
different user program for various machine types.
