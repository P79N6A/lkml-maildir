It has happened to me several times in the past that a connection to my
mail server across a sometimes-packetlossy cablemodem connection appears
to die and not come back at all or only after several minutes after the
packet loss stops and "ping -c 50" shows no loss at all.  This has
happened to me several times in the past, and it just happened to me
again (and is still happening in another console), with kernel 2.3.17
across the wire to server kernel 2.2.12 (I initiated the connection on
the 2.3.17 machine).  This has happened before between 2.2 kernels of
older versions as well, however.
I was typing an email via SSH which goes over eth0 through a local
crossover ethernet connection to another box which is connected to the
cablemodem and masquerades everything that wants to go out to the
Internet and sends it out the cablemodem.  I don't think the masqing is
the problem, though, as I'm seeing what looks to me like a problem with
TCP viewing from tcpdump on the host that isn't doing any masqing.
Basically, here's what happened:
I was typing the email, and suddenly what I was typing stopped appearing. 
The connection I had open to the mail server has been up for hours, and
it usually has an average ping of about 80ms.  I switched to another
console and did a "ping"...the first few packets were dropped, and then
the connection came back and it was fine for the rest of the pings.
I went back to the mail console and typed a few more characters -- still
nothing.  I did a "ping -c 50" in the other console, and when it finished
it dropped 2 of the 50 packets.  I went back and still nothing.
I went to the other console, and typed some commands:

<Still not much.  Finally, it gets sent and acked almost immediately, as

This goes on for about 6 or 7 more times (over a period of about 5
minutes), and just recently it went back to normal -- transmitted stuff
actually gets sent in the same second as when I type it.  The connection
is back to normal now, but this after at least 6 or 7 new ACKs have
arrived, and so it should have been able to collapse the round trip time
estimate down enough to transmit out new data relatively normally again
(or something, I'm not very familiar with the internals of TCP).  Some
timing value is somehow growing huge and is taking a long time to get
back to a reasonable value.  Surely a connection open for several hours
shouldn't suddenly get an average round trip time of over 10 seconds,
though, should it?
