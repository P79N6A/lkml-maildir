I'll repeat again.  NSLU2-Linux supports both BE and LE.  We have about
5,000 users running BE and about 5,000 users running LE.  Perhaps you're
confusing the NSLU2-Linux project (which official supports both endians
equally) with the Debian project (which official supports only LE, and
has an unofficial BE port).
One NSLU2-Linux person said they would prefer the driver to support LE,
but would be happy for it to be marked BE only in the Kconfig as an
alternative.  That is consistent with what I wrote in my message.

Please let's just stop arguing about it.  If a patch appears before it
gets merged, then great.  If it doesn't then it will appear at a later date.
