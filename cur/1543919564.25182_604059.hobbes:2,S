Hi all,
 I have enable suspend-to-disk on myetch system K 2.6.21.1
 I have enabled acpi cpu frequency scaling and using "convservative"
governer.
 When I boot the system, the cpu frequency works switches fine based on
the requirement. But when i go to hibernation and come back from
hibernation, the cpu frequency gets stuck at the maximum. 
 I have already written to debian-users list but did not get any reply
(with the same subject line). 
 Is this a known issue ?
 If i try to remove and re-insert the cpufreq_conservative module, the
whole system hangs.
thanks
