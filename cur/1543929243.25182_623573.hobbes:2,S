And for some use cases, that probably *is* the best answer..

We probably want to hear related usages as well - what *besides* A/V would be
interested? Indexing services?  Software that tries to limit the distribution
of sensitive info off the machine - for instance, imagine a rule that said
"Data that comes from a file that contains SSNs or the string 'Corporate
Secret' data isn't allowed to leave the computer" and a Perl-like 'taint'
concept.  I'm not saying its *doable*, but it's certainly a goal that somebody
would like to achieve...
