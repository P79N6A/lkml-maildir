Checkpoint is a terrible name for what I want to do to the process. 
The only thing I mean is that I want one of the "forked" processes
either wait() ing for the other one to end or SIGSTOPed so I can wake
it up when the other ends.  The sleeping one will be in the state that
the other was in at the time of the fork.

I would never suggest anyone else do this to a kernel they care deeply about.

I guess LD_PRELOAD could work.  It would be especially nice if I could
get inside a signal handler.
Thanks Pjotr
