Not a regression as it seems this user's box has always been broken. I've
been running heavy testing with 2.6.22rc6 and IT8212 and its working
reliably for the "dumb" mode in question.
The hardware mode needs a fix Tejun has queued somewhere (probably in
Jeff's vast backlog) and then works too.
I'm not even sure this report is IT8212 related rather than just an IRQ
storm
