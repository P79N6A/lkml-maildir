This is excellent news as it means the tunable SMP scheduling should
provide great benefit.  It also means Andrea's idea of self-tuning
scheduling would also appear to be necessary in the long-term as the
current process mix should determine where ont he flexibility <-> performance
line we want to scheduler to be living at for any particular moment.

Exactly.  To be honest, I'm impressed you could get 2X speedups, but not
overly surprised.  What frightens me (as you mention) is that if two
128K L2 caches can generate this large of a gap, then the 2MB (and
up to 8MB as the Athlon @ 0.18 will have) caches exacerbate this by
a *huge* amount.

It's not all that extreme from a cache behavior standpoint.  Loop blocking
is a technique taught in most good CS or comp. arch. classes for exactly
the huge cache benefits it can provide, and code that utilizes it or
other cache-efficient techniques (DSP, image, other scientific) will
need a scheduler to be much more sensitive to their cache behavior than
something like an office suite.

Great, glad to hear it :)
Trying to make the self-tuning part might be difficult, though, as
even getting the L2 miss counts from P6 MSR's during a slice doesn't
necessarily mean the code was cache-inefficient or could have done better
on the processor it started on.  Andrea may already have some ideas for
this, though, and we can certainly do things by-hand for now and add in
some more intelligence later.  After all, the most performance-sensitive
processes that we care about are going to tend to be long-running so
tuning by hand shouldn't be too painful, and is still more flexible than
the current method :)
