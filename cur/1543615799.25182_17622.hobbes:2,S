very correct.

one of the tips received was to set the penalty for cpu switch, i.e. set
  linux/include/asm/smp.h:#define PROC_CHANGE_PENALTY   15
to a much higher value (50). this had no effect on the results.

this would be an issue, agreed, but cache invalidation by cpu bounces
should also affect one-cpu jobs? thus is does not explain why this
effect should be (much) worse with 2 jobs.
