Well, I just re-tested with 2.6.17-rc4 and it does not seem to work.  No idea
what did I do wrong when testing this patch before posting it :(. Oops.
I'm sorry.
Given that its late in -rc series, that its a clear regression from 2.6.16, that
disabling MSI is always safe, and that the patch was intended to enable MSI on
Tyan motherboard which Roland used to have but doesn't anymore and which no one
else seems to be bothered to test on either - it seems the best thing is to just
revert the patch, and go back to using a global flag for now.
I'll try to revisit this for 2.6.18 if I can get my hands on such a system.
Greg, what do you think?
It's 6e325a62a0a228cd0222783802b53cce04551776 in Linus' tree:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=6e325a62a0a228cd0222783802b53cce04551776
Here's a minimal patch against 2.6.17-rc4 - I tested it by loading mthca with
msi_x=1.

Revert MSI quirk change in 6e325a62a0a228cd0222783802b53cce04551776 - it breaks 
regular AMD-8131 systems, and no one seems to care enough to test on Tyan
systems where it's supposed to improve performance.
