I'm having the same problem.
On my notebook (wireless PCMCIA, D-Link DWL650), 2.5.63 oopses immediately on 
trying to mount an NFS filesystem.  On my desktop it works fine.  I can't 
find any kernel configuration differences that look obvious.  I'll be glad to 
forward any relevant parts of the .config if it will be helpful.
I've read elsewhere that there's a simple patch that fixes this, but I haven't 
been able to find it anywhere.
