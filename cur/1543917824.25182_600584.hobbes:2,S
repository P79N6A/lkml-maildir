Subject: [GIT PULL -mm] 00/19 Unionfs updates/cleanups/fixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/1/6

The following is a series of patches related to Unionfs.  The main changes
here are compliance with coding style and assorted cleanups, based on lkml
comments and advise.  Specifically, the un/likely updates from the previous
series of patches was completely redone; the number of un/likely instances
was reduced from 546 to 163 and what's left are considered highly unlikely
(99% or higher threshold).
These patches were tested (where appropriate) on our 2.6.23-rc8 latest code,
as well as the backports to 2.6.{22,21,20,19,18,9} on ext2/3/4, xfs,
reiserfs, nfs2/3/4, jffs2, ramfs, tmpfs, cramfs, and squashfs (where
available).  See 
http://unionfs.filesystems.org/
 to download backported
unionfs code.
