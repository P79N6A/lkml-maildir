Hi
 I have a Thinpad X40 notebook, with a Ricoh SD Card Reader. This card
reader has not a Linux driver, so I can't use it. Googling I've deduced
nobody can, as everybody notes the same problem with the device.
 The device is not new, as my notebook is one year old. So it's strange we
still don't have a linux driver.
 I'd like to do something about it, and I've asked Ricoh and IBM for some
specs of the device, to try to build the driver. But they only answer
"There is no linux driver, and is not planned to release it."
 Obviously, this answer is useless, but I don't know what to do now... Do
you know if Ricoh has released specs before? Do you think IBM should have
them?
What would you do in my place? Which should be the next step?
Thanks
