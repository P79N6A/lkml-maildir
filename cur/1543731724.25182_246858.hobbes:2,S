The difference is that cat uses open() not openat().
With your model, can I do:
cat filenameA/metas/permissions > filenameB/metas/permissions
find / -exec cat {}/permissions \; | grep 4777 | wc -l
If yes, then we are talking past each other somehow rather than 
disagreeing. If metafiles can be opened with both open and openat() in 
your model, then we are discussing some small detail.
I think the answer is no though, in which case you are missing the point 
of the new design. Is the answer no?
