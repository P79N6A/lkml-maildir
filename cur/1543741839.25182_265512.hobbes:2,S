- - * Jun 17, 1994 : Modified to accommodate the broken pre-PCI BIOS SPECIFICATION
- - *	Revision 2.0 present on <thys@dennis.ee.up.ac.za>'s ASUS mainboard.
- - *
- - * Jan 5,  1995 : Modified to probe PCI hardware at boot time by Frederic
- - *     Potter, potter@cao-vlsi.ibp.fr
- - *
- - * Jan 10, 1995 : Modified to store the information about configured pci
- - *      devices into a list, which can be accessed via /proc/pci by
- - *      Curtis Varner, cvarner@cs.ucr.edu
- - *
- - * Jan 12, 1995 : CPU-PCI bridge optimization support by Frederic Potter.
- - *	Alpha version. Intel & UMC chipset support only.
- - *
- - * Apr 16, 1995 : Source merge with the DEC Alpha PCI support. Most of the code
- - *	moved to drivers/pci/pci.c.
- - *
- - * Dec 7, 1996  : Added support for direct configuration access of boards
- - *      with Intel compatible access schemes (tsbogend@alpha.franken.de)
- - *
- - * Feb 3, 1997  : Set internal functions to static, save/restore flags
- - *	avoid dead locks reading broken PCI BIOS, werner@suse.de 
- - *
- - * Apr 26, 1997 : Fixed case when there is BIOS32, but not PCI BIOS
- - *	(mj@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz)

- - * Aug 2,  1997 : Split to PCI BIOS handling and direct PCI access parts
- - *	and cleaned it up...     Martin Mares <mj@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz>
- - *
- - * Feb 6,  1998 : No longer using BIOS to find devices and device classes. [mj]
- - *
- - * May 1,  1998 : Support for peer host bridges. [mj]
- - *
- - * Jun 19, 1998 : Changed to use spinlocks, so that PCI configuration space
- - *	can be accessed from interrupts even on SMP systems. [mj]
- - *
- - * August  1998 : Better support for peer host bridges and more paranoid
- - *	checks for direct hardware access. Ugh, this file starts to look as
- - *	a large gallery of common hardware bug workarounds (watch the comments)
- - *	-- the PCI specs themselves are sane, but most implementors should be
- - *	hit hard with \hammer scaled \magstep5. [mj]
- - *
- - * Jan 23, 1999 : More improvements to peer host bridge logic. i450NX fixup. [mj]
- - *
