by "block-sized" you mean like 64 bytes for MD5 and SHA1, 16 bytes for
AES, and so forth?  if so that's no biggie, those are already present
in most simple library implementations of these algos.  but if "block"
means 4096 bytes then, aiee.
if module lookup is expensive then perhaps a much better api would be one
which yields a module handle -- and the module handle can be used in a
much less expensive allocator to create contexts where they're required.
it seems that the module handle could be a read-only structure and
therefore shared without locking.

this really sounds like two steps backwards and one step forward.
this CIFS patch alone replaces 89 lines with 250 lines of code!  the new
code does not look anywhere near as readable as the original.  but perhaps
that's just because i've dealt with the same trivial MD5Init/Update/Final
API for years.
i gather a lot of this comes from the desire to have run-time selectable
sw and hw implementations of various algorithms for "optimal" performance.
but there generally isn't an optimal algorithm for all situations.
for small short digests like passwords it's probably more overhead to
use the cryptoapi than is saved from any blindingly fast implementation
behind the scenes.
