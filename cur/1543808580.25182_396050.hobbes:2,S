PLease respond like this to any other mail with any proprietary module loaded.
WTF?! I just wanted to let you know... not more, not less.
I could also stop testing -mm and -git from now on. Unfortunately all my
machines have an nVidia graphics. Should all other people as well stop
reporting? Linux without X is useless to me. Sure, I could use the xorg module.
But it mostly sucks performance wise.
Moreover, I don't know in what way a PCI graphics adapter is pissing off USB
devices. Is there a chance to?
Calm down...

I didn't know I cannot reprocude this when I sent the report. Please update the
docs so people know to only report bugs/probs in case they're easyily to be
reproduced.
