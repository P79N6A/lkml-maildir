Read it again. :) 
The driver is able to create a class-specific object for the device, which 
it owns entirely. Russell is suggesting that if you're going to export 
attributes, you best be doing them as attributes of the object you own. 
Otherwise, if you're a subordinate module, then you should explicitly 
increment the refcount of the module of the object you're exporting 
attributes for, and decrement it when your module is unloaded. Then again, 
this may happen implicitly with modules..
