Actually, on ppc, I have no problem removing that old crap. I suppose
part of the problem Pavel is having is the new code never calling PCI
save_state().
The probleme here is related to the new semantics. save_state() is
indeed meaningless now, but a bunch of drivers implemented sleep in
there because this was really what was called on suspend()... So
unless we want to remove save_state from struct pci_driver and fix all
PCI drivers that implement it, we shall call both save_state() and
suspend() from pci-driver.c suspend routine. (Patch sent separately)

Well... I think I told you I don't like much the check on the interrupt
and tended to prefer either a separate power_down_irq callback or a
parameter, but that would mean changing prototype for drivers... I
agreed we can live with your current scheme though.
