/*
 * These are the actual BIOS calls.  Depending on APM_ZERO_SEGS and
 * apm_info.allow_ints, we are being really paranoid here!  Not only
 * are interrupts disabled, but all the segment registers (except SS)
 * are saved and zeroed this means that if the BIOS tries to reference
 * any data without explicitly loading the segment registers, the
kernel
 * will fault immediately rather than have some unforeseen
circumstances
 * for the rest of the kernel.  And it will be very obvious!  :-)
Doing
 * this depends on CS referring to the same physical memory as DS so
that
 * DS can be zeroed before the call. Unfortunately, we can't do
anything
 * about the stack segment/pointer.  Also, we tell the compiler that
 * everything could change.
 *
 * Also, we KNOW that for the non error case of apm_bios_call, there
 * is no useful data returned in the low order 8 bits of eax.

...and I think allow_ints was invented because of thinkpads.. So
AFAICT you can't rely on interrupts being off and you can't rely on
interrupts being on.
