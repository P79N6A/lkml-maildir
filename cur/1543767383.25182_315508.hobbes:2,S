Hi Pavel,
Although I like using pm_message_t, I'm not sure if we want to commit to only
PMSG_SUSPEND and PMSG_FREEZE for shutdown and reboot.  Would it be possible
to create a PMSG_HALT and PMSG_REBOOT?  I think this would give drivers more
control and flexability to make the right decision.  What is your opinion?
Of course, I'm still considering the posibility that we really want to do
PMSG_SUSPEND on a shutdown.  This may work ok on X86, I'm not sure about other
architectures.
I know you mentioned previously adding more flags and data to pm_message_t,
what exactly are your plans?
Thanks,
Adam
