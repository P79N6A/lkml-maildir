Subject: [PATCH] 2.3.19 compiler warnings

Attached is small patch to get rid of two unused variables complaints in 
drivers/scsi/sr.c by 2.3.19.
2.3.19 still has those "greater than maximum object file alignment"
warnings, probably related to NR_CPUS/NR_IRQS (I'm running a UP box here.)
Removing __cacheline_aligned gets rid of the errors, but as I'm not too
familiar with SMP spinlocking and such, I didn't include that in the
patch.
As a side note, is there any chance of getting Erez Zadok's loopback file
system into 2.3.20?
