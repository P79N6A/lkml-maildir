this is what MSG_MORE does. Basically i added MSG_MORE for the purpose of
getting perfect TUX packet boundaries (and was ignorant enough to not know
about BSD's NOPUSH), without an additional system-call overhead, and
without the persistency of TCP_CORK. Alexey and David agreed, and actually
implemented it correctly :-)
basically if MSG_MORE is not set that means an explicit packet boundary in
the noncontended scenario. If MSG_MORE is set then that means all full-MSS
packets are queued, partial packets are not queued (but are timing out).
sendfile() uses the more flag internally - i've changed sendfile() in my
tree to specify the more flag from higher levels as well - eg. if a sent
file is embedded into other replies, or multiple files are sent.
