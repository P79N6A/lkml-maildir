Most other people believe that Linux should have a
stable ABI so that apps don't break left and right.
Even if people have source code, they lose it. Even
if they don't lose it, they don't want to retest.
The developers may have gone on to better things.
People actually rely on Linux to work. Didn't OSDL
just add app+ABI testing? This is why.

I don't see why it is such trouble to provide the old data.
If new data is useful, provide that too.

I display the data as a column in "top". Docomentation is
much easier to deal with if it doesn't have lots of special
cases for different kernel versions.
I guess I'd prefer that the fields of Linux 2.4 be restored,
and that any new fields be added on the end. Note that the
text and data fields are supposed to be rss-like as well.
Except for the size, they're all supposed to be that way.
This data was created to match what BSD provides.
If adding a new file to /proc, please pick a short name
that is friendly toward tab completion. "phymem" is OK.
