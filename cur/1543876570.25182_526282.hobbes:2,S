My point is that is there is no cpufreq change when you
start mplayer with the powersave governor.  Have you 
disabled powernow! entirely (by removing the module) and
demonstrated that mplayer works on your machine at all?
To redirect the console, add console=ttyS0,115200 to your 
kernel command line and run a serial console from the serial 
port on the test machine to another machine, and then use your 
preferred serial port capture program (minicom or whatever) 
to capture the text.

AMD bought ATI, not the other way around.  That said, elements
of AMD are responsible for the PowerNow! driver, and other 
elements of AMD are responsible for the fglrx driver.
