Hi,
I have written one function in assembly for my kernel module.
Function is in module3.s file.
I have added the module3.o file in the object list in the Makefile.
But it shows compile time warning and following output.
What do I need to do to compile assembly code in my kernel module.
CC [M]  /home/parav/cache_improve/test_module/module1.o
CC [M]  /home/parav/cache_improve/test_module/module2.o
as -a32 -o /home/parav/cache_improve/test_module/module3.o
/home/parav/cache_improve/test_module/module3.s
LD [M]  /home/parav/cache_improve/test_module/sdk3_module.o
Building modules, stage 2.
MODPOST
Warning: could not find /home/parav/cache_improve/test_module/.module3.o.cmd
for /home/parav/cache_improve/test_module/module3.o
*** Warning: "test_func"
[/home/parav/cache_improve/test_module/sdk3_module.ko] undefined!
*** Warning: "" [/home/parav/cache_improve/test_module/sdk3_module.ko]
undefined!
I expect CC[M] kind of command for the module3.o file also so that
.module3.o.cmd file gets generated.
Regards,
Parav Pandit
