Except the led code that is being proposed CAN sit on top of a generic
GPIO layer.  If a generic GPIO layer is created, you can create a led
driver that calls out to that GPIO layer.
You just need to fill in the following functions with some that raise and
lower the GPIO on the correct line....
int (*color_get)(struct device *, struct led_properties *props);
void (*color_set)(struct device *, struct led_properties *props, int value);
int (*brightness_get)(struct device *, struct led_properties *props);
void (*brightness_set)(struct device *, struct led_properties *props, int
value);
