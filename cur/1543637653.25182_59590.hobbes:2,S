Ok, so lets go through your claims.

The text refers you, via a hyperlink to the read() function.  Which is
singular, because the interface is singular.  I fail to see what point
you're making here.

This sentence does not allow any misinterpretation:
   A pending read shall not be satisfied until MIN bytes are received
   (that is, the pending read shall block until MIN bytes are received),
   or a signal is received.
You call a read() on a blocking file descriptor.  It blocks until MIN bytes
are received.  End of story.  If you have MIN set to 10, and you've called
read(,,1), the pending read is blocked, for 1 byte and "shall block until
MIN bytes are received".  Crystal clear.

Who cares about the Linux manual pages when discussing a standard?  The
manual pages discuss an implementation of a standard that may very well
be buggy.  They are not a standard unto themselves.
As Alan Cox just confirmed to me - "Read SuSv3 , nothing else matters".

I disagree.  Firstly, this standard isn't describing your user space
program.  It's describing the behaviour of the read() system call with
respect to blocking.  Secondly, the third sentence of this paragraph
gives some insight into the purpose of VMIN:
  A program that uses case B to read record-based terminal I/O may block
  indefinitely in the read operation.
but that's only insight, and you can't hang too much on that.

The standard covers that case:
  If data is in the buffer at the time of the read(), the result shall be
  as if data has been received immediately after the read().
So pre-existing data in the driver waiting to be read is treated as if
it were received _after_ you called read().  Which is sensible.

The Linux manual page is not a standard.  It is therefore meaningless to
this discussion.
