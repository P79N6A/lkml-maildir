Or use scsi_debug to fake drives/controllers, works wonderful as well
for some things and involve the full IO stack.
I'd like to second Davids emails here, this is a serious problem. Having
a reproducible test case lowers the barrier for getting the problem
fixed by orders of magnitude. It's the difference between the problem
getting fixed in a day or two and it potentially lingering for months,
because email ping-pong takes forever and "the test team has moved on to
other tests, we'll let you know the results of test foo in 3 weeks time
when we have a new slot on the box" just removing any developer
motivation to work on the issue.
