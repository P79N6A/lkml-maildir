While we're having thoughts, this thread keeps me thinking
it would make sense to have a block device driver that would
be assigned unused memory.
I don't mean memory on video cards etc.  I'm thinking of the
10% of RAM unused when 1GB systems are booted with MEM=900M
because they run faster with HIGHMEM turned off.
The primary use for this "device" would be high priority swap.
Even with whatever overhead it takes to access it should be
orders of magnitude faster than any spinning media.
