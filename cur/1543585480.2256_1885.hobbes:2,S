Hi again.
I've written my own test program, and I get 12M throughput.
I used a packet size of 1024 Bytes. Smaller packages seems to result in 
less throughput.
There was no load on the machine I tested on. Does the throughput get 
better is there is a lot of stress on the machine? (eg. compiling kernel 
with -j 10).
It could also be the NIC itself, but this I cannot test (I'm using a 
3Com 905b) card. Have you tried to replace the NIC?
