Right now there is quite a lot of code between get_pid and the insertion 
into the task list: copy mm, files, etc.
And just before the endless loop in get_pid(), there is only one pid 
left --> probability of getting the same pid again is high. If you fix 
the hang, you should fix the atomicity, too.

Doesn't work: find_task_by_pid() only checks task->pid. But the result 
of get_pid mustn't be in use as a session or tgid value either
