You have that option just fine; if you build your own initramfs you
can do whatever you want.

To be able to *require* it, which means it can't significantly bloat
the total size of the kernel image.  klibc binaries are *extremely*
small.  Static kinit is only a few tens of kilobytes, a lot of which
is zlib.

- Bigger by an order of magnitude
- License issues
- Platform support
- Speed of portability (klibc is fully portable to a new platform in an afternoon)
- Additional issues which you can find if look through the archives of this list
