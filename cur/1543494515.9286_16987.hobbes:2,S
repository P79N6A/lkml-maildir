Hello All,
    I was watching TV last night, and on came a commercial from the Lennox
company for their furnaces.  I looked up because they pronounce Lennox the
same way I pronounce Linux, but what really caught my attention was that
the commercial was full of penguins (it goes with their furnace theme).
I kept expecting Linus to appear in a cameo somewhere.
Well I told you it was off topic up front :-)
Jim
