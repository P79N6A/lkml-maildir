0x80 is the manufacturing test port. If you have a watchdog that
cares about that, it's broken. The kernel didn't reserve it, the
AT-Class hardware did. In fact during POST, you can read numbers
written to that port to see how far a, possibly defective, board
has gotten upon power up.
If you look in /usr/src/linux/include/asm/io.h, you will see where
it is written to anytime it is essential to slow down I/O. This works
because this port is properly handled and takes almost exactly 300 ns
for the write, regardless of CPU speed.

You can't 'map' it somewhere else. Ports are ports decoded by PALS in
hardware (unless it's a high address going through the PCI bridge, but
that's a different thing altogether). You could change the 'outb' to
an 'inb' instruction, i.e., read the port. However, if your WD timer
is mucking with a port it definitely doesn't own, it probably won't
make much difference.
