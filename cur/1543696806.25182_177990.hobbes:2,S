ESTALE is "errno" 116
EIO  is "errno" 5
ERESTARTSYS is "errno" 512
You can find these in /usr/include/asm/errno.h (not good to
directly include in a program).
The program reporting these errors should have included:
<errno.h>
<string.h>
Then used...
	strerror(errno);
or
	perror("");
etc.
Errno 512 should never be seen by user-mode program, so the
header file, /usr/include/linux/errno.h, states...
ESTALE happens when a mounted file-system is on a server that
went down or re-booted. The file-handles are then "stale".
EIO is a general catch-all for an I/O error.
ERESTARTSYS is the error returned by a server that has
re-booted that is supposed to tell the client-side software
to get a new file-handle because of an attempt to access with
a stale file-handle. When getting this error, the client
should have reopened the file(s) to obtain a new handle.
Cheers,
