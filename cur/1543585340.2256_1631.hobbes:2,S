		Hello everybody,
	This is a message on behalf of a friend that is not subscribed to list:
	It's about an ASUS board that has this ncr53-1010 dual 160 SCSI
controller (sym53c1010).
	On both latest kernels (2.2.18ac19 AND 2.4.2ac18) the log and console
is filled with that:
	sym53c1010-33-0: unable to abort current chip operation.
	sym53c1010-33-0: Downloading SCSI SCRIPTS.
	sym53c8xx_reset: pid=0 reset_flags=2 ...
	and the controller suddenly blocks and the system have be restarted.
	Do someone know the meaning of this messages and what's matter, do you
want more details and what else ???
			Regards,
			Mircea C.
