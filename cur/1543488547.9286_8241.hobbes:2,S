 Two CPU's can't write to the same location of the cache at the same 
time, and in DSM two processes can't write to the same page at the same 
time. Same inherent limitation.

 First time I hear being slower is a sign of being fundamentally flawed.

 I guess most people know this. I would use a semaphore for 
synchronization in a DSM application.

 Can be done with no hardware support. Look at the Amiga OS that ran on a 
little MC68000. They put support for it in the hardware because most OS 
designers needed it. That's it.

 I don't know about that case. It works properly under DIPC.

 IMO, You're reasons are not very valid.

 Nearly all of the things you are using now were first developed in CS 
labs. Some things would catch on and some won't. In most cases 
non-technical reasons are involved in a concept's wide-spread usage.

 DSM may not be the only way, but it sure is nice and easy to use.

 Agreed. The programmer who needs to avoid such pitfalls has to be 
careful. The good thing is that DIPC will work even if the application 
behaves in such ways. The programmer can always go back and improve on 
his already-working app.

 That is your opinion, and believe me, you'll have a hard time convincing 
me of that.
