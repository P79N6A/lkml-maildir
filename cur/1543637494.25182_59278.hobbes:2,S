Maybe the 1300 doesn't have as broken a USB implementation as the 1400
does.  In linux/drivers/usb/storage/unusual_devs.h there is an entry for
the 1400.
UNUSUAL_DEV(  0x04cb, 0x0100, 0x0000, 0x2210,
                "Fujifilm",
                "FinePix 1400Zoom",
                US_SC_8070, US_PR_CBI, NULL, US_FL_FIX_INQUIRY),
The third and fourth numbers are the range of product identifiers to
consider unusual.  0x0000 - 0x2210 is probably a little broad.  Try
changing that to 0x2210 - 0x2210 and see if your 1300 works again.
