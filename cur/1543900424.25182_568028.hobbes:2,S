But that misses the point. It means that the commit that actually 
*changes* the code never actually gets tested on its own
Why not just fix up the HPET code so that it can be shared *first*. 
Without the other conversion? Really - What's so wrong with the hpet.c 
changes in the *absense* of conversion to clockevents? Those changes seem 
to be totally independent - just abstracting ou tthe 
"hpet_get_virt_address()" stuff etc.
None of that has anything to do with clockevents, as far as I can see.
In other words, you now change a i386-only file, and maybe it breaks 
subtly on i386 as a result. Wouldn't it be nicer to see that breakage as a 
separate event?
Then, the x86-64 clockevents code will switch over entirely, but now it 
switches over to something we can say has gotten testing, and we know the 
switch-over won't break any 32-bit code, because the switch-over literally 
didn't change anything at all for that case.
See? THAT is what I mean by "gradual". Bugs happen, but if we can make 
_independent_ bugs show up in _independent_ commits, that will make it 
much easier to figure out what happened.
The same is true of a lot of the APIC timer code. Sure, that patch has the 
actual conversion in it, and you don't have the cross-architecture issues, 
but more than 50% of the patch seems to be just cleanup that is 
independent of the actual switch-over, no?
Again, if it was done as a "one patch for cleanup, and another patch that 
actually switches the higher-level interfaces around", then the two mostly 
independent issues (of "hardware access/initialization" vs "higher-level 
changes in how it got called") get done as two independent commits.
And no, I really probably wouldn't ask for this, but 2.6.21 showed 
*exactly* this problem. Trivial debugging helps like "git bisect" didn't 
help at all, because all the problems started when the new code was 
"activated", not when it was actually brought in.
