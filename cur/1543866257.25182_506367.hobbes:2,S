Yes, kbuild is a bit of a problem at present.
I'm sitting on these:
search-a-little-harder-for-mkimage.patch
make-mkcompile_h-use-lang=c-and-lc_all=c-for-cc-v.patch
add-mailmap-for-proper-git-shortlog-output.patch
qconf-immediately-update-integer-and-string-values-in-xconfig-display-take-2.patch
qconf-relocate-search-command.patch
qconf-fix-showing-help-info-on-failed-search.patch
qconf-back-button-behaviour-normalization.patch
kbuild-remove-references-to-deprecated-prepare-all-target.patch
new-toplevel-target-headers_check_all.patch
But I'm not sure that anyone has reviewed them much.
I'll probably just push 'em and see what happens.  They seem to work.
