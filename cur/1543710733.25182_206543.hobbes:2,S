But this is true whether the client is mapping the UIDs or not.  The server
wouldn't know whether the client is mapping UIDs or not, so it shouldn't trust
UIDs from a client that isn't supposed to be using that UID.

Still true regardless of client-side UID mapping.

Still true regardless of client-side UID mapping.
Maybe you are confusing some term "mapping" that you understand for the
server-side (related to allowing only certain UIDs for a particular host?)
with an unrelated operation of the same name that Søren is proposing
(which is just a simple uid->uid translation)?
