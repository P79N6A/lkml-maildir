I think that should read "even if they have ...", not "only if ...".

Unless it's suspended ... and I confess I've only had time to
make sure that OHCI and EHCI suspend properly using the
newish CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND patch.  UHCI is different
from those other mainstream controllers, it doesn't split
out its periodic schedule processing.
Keep in mind that to properly quiesce a USB controller, you've
got to quiesce every driver for every device hooked up to
that USB bus.  There's no escaping the bottom-up suspend
or top-down-resume processes, which makes me wonder
how Patrick's proposed patch can work for it...
