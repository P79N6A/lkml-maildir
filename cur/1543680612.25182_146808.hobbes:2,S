Sorry if this is a duplicate...I received an error bounce

ACPI isn't absolutely needed, but it comes in handy for issuing a
shutdown.
Though I suppose I can use apm to do this as well.
On a uni-processor system, isn't the ACPI tables used to setup the
IO-APIC bits to have PCI IRQ routing so that I have more than 16
interrupts?  This was another reason I had enabled ACPI.
When I do get those interrupt problems, my network still continues to
function while the USB mouse fails.  I do agree it's not USB specific.
It's more tied in to ACPI/(IO-)APIC.
When I get back home, I'll try booting it with acpi=off on pre4 and see
how it goes.
