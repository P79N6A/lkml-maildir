OK.  More than two years after kprobes went into the kernel, a single
in-kernel user has now appeared in 2.6.18-rc: /net/ipv4/tcp_probe.c
So by your argument kprobes should not have been merged until now.

How so?  Last time I tried it I had to manually copy parts of headers 
from libpfm to get the fields but that should be easy to fix.  And
some wrappers around the low-level functions might be nice but again
that's easy to add.
