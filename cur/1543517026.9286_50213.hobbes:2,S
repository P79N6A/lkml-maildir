I was planning on just depending on the sanity of the page cache on this
one. Basically we have two cases:
 - paging in something new ("no_page"), for which the final test is just
   to test that the page table is still zero (ie we don't even need to
   save any "original" value).
 - paging in something old ("swap_page"), in wich case the final test is
   to check that the pte is still the same as swp_entry_to_pte(entry).
(we have the rw_page case too, but that is already protected by the
spinlock appropriately as far as I can tell, exactly because it already
has the same race wrt page_out rather than page_in).
No, I haven't checked the exact details. Maybe it's worse than I envision,
but it _looks_ like adding a simple spinlock and the test. If the test
fails, we just return and expect the fault to happen again..
