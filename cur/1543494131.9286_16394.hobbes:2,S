Take a look at the way emacs does this. When you build emacs from
source (this used to be true for version 18.<mumble> but I think it hasn't
changed) it actually builds a small lisp machine (temacs), loads in all the
real emacs lisp (which takes some time), gets itself to a state where it's
ready to edit files and dumps an image to disk, converting it to an
executeable. When you fire up the [quite large] executeable it's ready to
edit files almost immediately.
I was amazed (and not a little impressed) that this was a mechanism that
could be used cross platform.
