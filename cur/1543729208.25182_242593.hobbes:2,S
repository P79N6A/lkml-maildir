Subject: Hang after "BIOS data check successful" with DVI

When I have a DVI display plugged into my Matrox G550 video card the
boot process hangs at "BIOS data check successful". I am running Linux
kernel 2.6.6. This problem does not affect Linux kernel 2.4.26. If I
boot without the DVI display plugged in, I can plug it in after the
boot process and the display works.
Please cc me in your reply. Thanks,
Shaun
