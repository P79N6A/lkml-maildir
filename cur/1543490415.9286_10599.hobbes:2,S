Another datapoint..
Client 300a IDE drive
Server PPRO 200 256Megs of ram 2.3.0 Knfsd
  5*4gig split raid5/Raid0 array
Connected via Fullduplex 100Mbit Ethernet
Client 2.2.0 - Mp3's played off internal ide skipfree with no buffering
Then moved all but basic OS to server and upgraded client to 2.3.0.
Now need buffering to play mp3's.. Even with hot cache on the server.
