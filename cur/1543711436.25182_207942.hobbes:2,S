Yes, that's why there are separate 'supported' and 'enabled' bits for 
each feature.
Words 82-84 are 'supported' bits.  Words 85-87 are 'enabled' bits. 
These bits mirror each other, i.e. Word 83 and Word 86 have basically 
the same bits, except that Word 86 definitions change _slightly_ since 
the only bits that are relevant are the ones for features that can be 
disabled/enabled.
You use set-features command to enable and disable these features, and 
then the result shows up in subsequent identify-device command output.
If the driver is testing for a capability but does not enable it, then 
always use the 'enabled' set of bits, not the 'supported' set of bits.

I disagree.  "just issue it" is how those LG cdrom drives got cooked.
LG cdrom drives indicated in their identify-packet-device page that 
flush-cache was not supported...  and then re-used the flush-cache ATA 
opcode for their vendor-specific download-firmware command.  Combine 
that with a Linux patch that didn't properly check for flush-cache 
support.  Result: brick.
All drives that support flush-cache list the relevant bits in 
identify-device, even on pre-ATA-6 devices.  Whether the feature was 
optional or mandantory, we can check the feature bits.
