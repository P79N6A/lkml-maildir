Yup, there are several such fixups needed.  See
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.9-rc4/2.6.9-rc4-mm1/broken-out/assign_irq_vector-section-fix.patch.
If you're testing kexec you might be better off using 2.6.9-rc4-mm1 (minus
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.9-rc4/2.6.9-rc4-mm1/broken-out/optimize-profile-path-slightly.patch
)
because it has the latest kexec version (it had better be!) and whatever
fixups people have found against it.
