I have the problem.
As I read mails between Alan, Ioan and Trond on the above subject I decided
to try
Trond's tcp-hang patch to see It really solves the problem.
I dont think so. In my source tree there are not compiled files in
net/sunrpc dir, and CONFIG_SUNRPC is not set in my .config!
I use HP E60 machine with four eepro100 cards and with internal AIC7xxx
controller. It is running for a long time uninterrupted
(since there is 2.2.19 kernel)
Today I tried to install freeswan1.9. After establishing ipsec tunnel with
my peer I got the wait_on_bh message.
(I cannot paste exactly because It is a production machine, and I restarted
it as fast as I could)
So what to do?
