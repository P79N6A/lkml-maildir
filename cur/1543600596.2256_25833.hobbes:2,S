To tell you the honest truth: you are not alone in cosmos (with this problem)
;-)
To give you that explicit hint for saving money: do not buy mem, it will be
eaten up by recent kernels without any performance gain or other positive
impact whatsoever. 
Try using 2.4.4, if it doesn't succeed, forget 2.4 and use 2.2.19. That works.
Unfortunately you may have to completely reinstall your system when going back
to 2.2.

Stephan
