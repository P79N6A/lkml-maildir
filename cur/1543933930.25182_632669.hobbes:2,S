ok - so i guess i should drop this from x86.git:
 @@ -53,7 +53,6 @@ void __save_processor_state(struct saved
         ctxt->cr2 = read_cr2();
         ctxt->cr3 = read_cr3();
         ctxt->cr4 = read_cr4();
 -       ctxt->cr8 = read_cr8();
  }
right? But i'm wondering - are we really ever resuming to a different 
kernel version, for this to be an issue?
