Hi Anthony,
	Not sure I get this.  It is a unique identifier.  You need the length
to handle unknown fields.

Well, they're *all* stateful.  This gives a simple method of knowing what 
fields the guest understands: it marks the fields as it finds them.  Then it 
sets the status, which allows the host to know when it's completed 
configuration reads.
I like enumerating the virtqueues: it's not necessary but it's clearer.

I'd be happy for a simpler mechanism...
Cheers,
Rusty.
