Ok, noted. :-)
I myself am not very interested in generic named stream support in
Linux.  But since we have support for filesystems with named streams
and people are interested in getting at those streams (if nothing else
thanq to serve streams from an NTFS file system via Samba on a dual boot
machine), we'd better do it well, instead of with ugly hacks.

Regarding this section and all you wrote before, I definitely agree.
Simplicity wins hands down every time.
