Well, Al definitely shot forth many flames over devfs, for sure :)
I do not know the time line of the flames vs. any decisions made by
Richard, though.  Some flamage was definitely earlier, when Richard was
active, and some flames were definitely after Richard scaled back his
kernel development.  And, yes, Al flames very hard and a bit rude -- but
I have never seen him wrong, that is for sure ;-)
So I cannot comment over _why_ defvs is unmaintained, but that is not
the point: either way, it stands that devfs is unmaintained.  That is a
problem in and of itself.
