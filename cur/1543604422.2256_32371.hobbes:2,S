kernlel-net is also good for this kind of questions.

May be because of MTU?

As I've right understood it from 
www.linux.org.uk/Documents/buffers.html (excellent Alan's book)
http://kernelnewbies.org/documents/ipnetworking/linuxipnetworking.html
(the best source of documentation fobeginners)
and skbuff.h
skb->data_len is actuall length of the data( that is all packet length -
header length).
skb_shinfo(skb) returns structure that containig number of fragments, list
of it, and some other( what? ).
JZ> May you explain them?  Thank you.
I'm trying, but it can be absolutelly wrong :)
