Actually, I now found the _real_ bug that explains both the "inode->i_dev"
_and_ the block size problem.
We have the wrong inode.
We use the on-disk inode, which is NOT the same as the "mapping" inode for
actually doing the IO.
This simple (and completely untested) patch should fix it.
This two-liner should also actually make the previous patch completely
unnecessary, because now "inode->i_dev" should be automatically correct. I
should have realized that inode->i_dev should always be right, and have
thought more about the fact that it wasn't.
