Thank you for your suggestions.  I did change SuperH implementation so
that it uses init_bootmem_node and free_area_init_core.  Well, it
works.
But I'm not sure if it's good use or not.  At least, it seems that
free_area_init_core is not intended to be used, since it is not
defined in header file.
Things are going like this:
	setu_arch
	    call
		init_bootmem_node
	paging_init
	  get info. from:
	    NODE_DATA(0)->bdata->node_boot_start
	    NODE_DATA(0)->bdata->node_low_pfn
	  then call
		free_area_init_core (Should I use free_area_init_node instead?)
	mem_init
	  get info. from:
	    NODE_DATA(0)->bdata->node_boot_start
	    NODE_DATA(0)->bdata->node_low_pfn
I think that it would be better if we define macros for START_PFN and
MAX_LOW_PFN, then we could eliminate the variable max_low_pfn even
in the i386 implementation.
