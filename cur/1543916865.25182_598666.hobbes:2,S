Mysterious.
ioremap_nocache() does __ioremap(..., _PAGE_PCD);, then __ioremap() does
ioremap_page_range(..., _PAGE_PCD | other_stuff) That's one.
__ioremap() then does ioremap_change_attr(..., _PAGE_PCD);.  That's two.
So I _think_ we're setting _PAGE_PCD twice on those pte's?  Unclear.  The
implementation is rather different from i386, too.
I dunno why __change_page_attr() failed though.  Perhaps this, in
change_page_attr_addr():
		if (!kernel_map || pte_present(pfn_pte(0, prot))) {
should be &&
Andi's taking a bit of time off, so we may need to park this until he
resurfaces.
