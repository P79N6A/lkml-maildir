1. Kernel (2.2.9) crash after trying to mount a swap-device.
2. Well of course you shouldn't mount swap ;-) Still I think this
   problem worth a bug report since a failing mount attempt shouldn't
   crash the kernel.
    Trying to reproduce the problem I found out that if you try to
   mount the swap-device (may it be a partition or a file accessed
   through the loop-device), which of course fails, the swap goes
   unstable. When the system begin to use swap it more or less crashes.

kernel output.
   My swap is at /dev/hda1 (3:01).
# mount /dev/hda1 /mnt

If you are lucky you might be able to kill the process but the system is
then very unstable.

I've successfully reproduced this bug on another system (kernel 2.2.7)
using a swap through the loop-device.
I've also noticed that if I turned off the swap after the mount and the
turned it on again I could continue use the system for a while. Although then
suddenly all processes went zombie and I had to reboot ;-)
Now, I'm not a kernel coder but I think the problem could be something 
close to this. When trying to mount the swap device the blocksize for
accessing the device is set to 512, from "Transaction block size = 512".
Although this value is not reset to the original (4096) and when the 
kernel needs swap again and want to access the device the blocksizes
mismatch, 
"kernel: ll_rw_block: device 03:01: only 512-char blocks implemented
(4096)".
Hope you got enough information about the problem.
Thanks
