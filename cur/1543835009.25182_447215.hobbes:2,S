my 'stance' is pretty common-sense: exploitable deadlocks (it's possible 
to force eviction of a page), or even hard-to-trigger but possible 
deadlocks (which are not associated with hopeless resource exhaustation) 
must be fixed.
couldnt we exclude the case of 'write writing to the same page it is 
reading from' abuse, to avoid the deadlock problem?
