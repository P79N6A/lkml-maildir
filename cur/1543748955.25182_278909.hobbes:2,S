Yield used to not show a spin in `top`.  Also, contrary to
"popular" opinion, not all events are accompanied by interrupts.
If they where, I'd gladly use one of the sleep_on* functions.
For instance, I need to erase NVRAM (Flash). Then I need to
program each byte. Waiting for the completion events requires
polling the hardware. Proper software will give up the CPU
while waiting and only sample the event, not continually spin.
You can get away with software murder if you only need to program
something that saves some state between shutdowns. However, if
you have a writable flash file-system you need to do it right.

The timeout of (0) was really to make the code more obvious, the
facts being that we really need to get the CPU back as soon as
there are no higher-priority tasks computable. If yield() would
work like schedule(0), of course I'd use it. The major problem
with yield() probably has to do with accounting. The machine
"feels" as though the CPU is properly available when you need
it, however it appears to be spinning, using 100% system time.
This makes customers nervous.
