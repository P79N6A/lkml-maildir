I've been looking at the memory intialization routines, and I have a couple
questions.  (I'm using 2.3.19 source)
First, some entries in include/asm-i386/fixmap.h confuse me.  At line 73, we
see this comment:
"Leave one empty page between vmalloc'ed areass and the start of the fixmap,
and leave one page empty at the top of mem..", followed by:
#define FIXADDR_TOP		(0xffffe000UL)
#define FIXADDR_SIZE		(__end_of_fixed_addresses << PAGE_SHIFT)
#define FIXADDR_START	(FIXADDR_TOP - FIXADDR_SIZE)
Pages being 12 bits, this is all odd to me.  If the comment is correct, why
is FIXADDR_TOP 0xffffe000UL and not 0xfffff000UL?  Why is it written as a
numeric constant instead of 
(~(PAGE_SIZE -1)) ? (Or (~(PAGE_SIZE * 2 -1), if that is what is intended?)
Now __end_of_fixed_addresses is the end of the enum fixed_addresses, so it
really is the count of the fixed address pages, making size right.  Now in
fixmap_init (/arch/i386/mm/init.c), we see that the addresses covered run
from FIXADDR_START to FIXADDR_TOP.  There is no appearance of an offset.
---
At the end of setup_arch, (arch/i386/kernel/setup.c) a bunch of entries are
added to the iomem_resource tree.  It would appear that reserved parts of
memory are nodes on this tree.  The entries come from a static struct
resource array ram_resources, which is updated a bit before the calls are
made.
I may have more reserved regions to add to the tree.  Is it safe just to
plop them in under the appropriate region?
