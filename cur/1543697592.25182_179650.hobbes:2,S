Thanks for the advice, but this drive has been plugged into 3 different
controllers on different machines using different cables.  Both this drive
and the backup drive refused to fsck clean (they had a lot of errors with
directory corruption problems).  
It is not a dirty cable or a bad controller, I've been building and 
debugging PC hardware for years and I know how to track down obvious
problems.
Sorry to be short but I already said that I'd eliminated this source of
error.  What did you think I was doing all weekend?
