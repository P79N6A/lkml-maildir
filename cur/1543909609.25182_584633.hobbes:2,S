Yes please.
The LK MAINTAINERS file is ugly.
Might there be a git portable way to "find"?
Rene Herman had an idea about using some git
metadata that might be useful.  The completely
external data approach suggested by Al Viro 
might be OK too in that it wouldn't tie listeners
to git requiring more content in git metadata.
Perhaps both via something like:
	--external-find "cmd @filelist"
Thanks,  Joe
