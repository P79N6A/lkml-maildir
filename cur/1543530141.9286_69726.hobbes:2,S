That is less objectionable with user resource limits available.

This was the only case that vfork was to be used. The "interesting" cases
are not relevent - they don't use vfork. I think the equivalent to vfork
should be available for those cases where fork is followed by exec. It would
make computing maximum swap sizes much easier. The simple: # of concurrent
users * # of processes per user * amount of memory per process + amount
guaranteed for system; is one. If the resource limits are available then
the user may run one very large process or a group of smaller processes,
and the system never runs out of memory. If system + all concurrent users
use up everything, then your system needs to shutdown.

It is exceptional on single user systems. Not so exceptional on servers.

This is the case where user limits prevent the user from killing the system.
A malicious user will only hurt himself. The other users will be unaffected,
other than the normal reduction of CPU time and memory resources alloted
to the user.
It IS still possible to use up all user resources, but only by loging in
for as many times as there are concurrent users permitted. This limit still
won't cause an OOM, since the amount guaranteed for system will allow the
system to identify the user - and administration can direct the user to be
terminated.
I have run systems that allow overcommit, and do not allow it. On those
systems that allow it management has to be told that it rebooted because
someone used too much memory.
On single user workstations it generally isn't a problem. On large multi-user
systems, management tends to get upset over unexplained crashes and random
program aborts.
