Amen to this. May "the force" be with you! (I mean the force in you fingers!)
AS you may know I was once (an eon ago)
during the Marc Lord "era" involved in the initial developement of the cmd640
support. And well we got it working, but after that some friend got to the idea
of the black list and my disk went from georgious 5M/sec to only lame 2.8M/sec
rates (remember it was a conner 400MB drive then one of those "buggy" Quantums!)
for no good reason. I was long time patching every single kernel those time for
this. So if anything I very well know that the list found there is both:
obsolete and invalid. Further on my CMD640 code wasn't even trying to compute
the timing values in any dynamic ways. I was just using the original tables from
CMD directly, but unfortunately the maintainer enjoyed Z/ ring arithmetics too
much ;-)

PIIX na VIA comes to mind first ;-)...
