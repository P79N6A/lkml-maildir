Hmmm ... My concern is not to write _spaghetti_ code, whatever it is
kernel code or not. I want to use cleanly and clearly exported interfaces  
and to also provide cleanly and clearly exported interfaces.
Btw, I probably was writing and maintaining kernel code (drivers and ACPs
under VAX/VMS) when you were still sucking bottles. ;-) 
And most of the application code I wrote these last 10 years is still
used in our products. My experience is that it generally just runs 5 to
100 times faster than equivalent code written with some bad modern
approach and occupies in average 2 to 10 times less memory. Btw, 30 % of
my work is to rewrite recent broken code into correct code so that it will
really work and be maintainable (evolutive) for a long-time.

I will never wrote anything that explicitely "vmalloc if get_free_pages
failed", except in something that belongs to the VM, because it is just 
broken design and shit code to rely on that from any other part than the 
VM under Linux.

What another strange and stupid idea ...
Implementing every idea that comes to your mind within the minute, is the
right approach to break everything. It seems to me that there is a long
way for you to learn how programs must be designed and implemented.
