I know, but currently it places a lot of unnecessary load on the
linux-libc-headers maintainer, and sometimes that doesn't get done
correctly.  For most of the above, all the maintainer will need to
do is move the ioctl and struct declarations necessary in userspace
from the header file in linux/ to a corresponding one in kabi/,
_maybe_ change a few macro names, and then verify that it all still
works correctly.

Yeah, that was actually a rather poorly chosen example, but it
does somewhat illustrate the way we would preserve compatibility.

Yeah.  I would have given one of the types.h files, except those
are so massively chaotic and with all sorts of cross dependencies
that I haven't tinkered with them enough yet.  I'm working on it,  
though!

My plan is to start with a bunch of cleanups that make it easier
to split the files, and then proceed to begin splitting the low
level files that are essential to everything else.  Once that's
done, I would move on to the other headers, the ones that have
dependencies on lots of headers.  I'll probably have to submit
cleanups to stuff like linux/kernel.h, linux/sched.h, etc, to
prevent include cycles.

This would make life a million times easier for the UML people,
the glibc people, the klibc people, and the linux-libc-headers
maintainer (IE: you don't need one, and he can go do something
more productive), etc.  If you want proof, several of the above
groups have previously voiced in support of this project in
this very thread.
This is definitely not a short-term project, and will really only
reach significant improvements for those groups by around
2.6.30 or so, but many feel it's a necessary change.
Cheers,
