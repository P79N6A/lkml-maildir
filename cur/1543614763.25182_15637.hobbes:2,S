agreed - it's something that really irritates me too. As Linux is 
running on so many different architectures (some of which are purely 
virtual, such as Usermode Linux and my whacky idea of running it ontop 
of MacOS X) so it seems that keeping all the options for architectures 
separate would make a lot of sense. I've never seen a cross-platform 
binary kernel (although have had scary dreams of one)

This shouldn't be too hard should it? In each module directory have a 
config and Configure.help file, then just
find . |grep config
and then cat all the files together. If I have some spare time today 
I'll see if I can hack something up.... :)
