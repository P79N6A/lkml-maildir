having just yesterday run afoul of this, i second this sentiment.  i
got a new faster hard disk and i copied the root system over to it.
then i built a new kernel.  unfortunately, i botched my lilo config
and specified the wrong root partition (no biggie, i had good config
entries).  when i booted, my modules were nowhere to be found (well,
they were on the other parition, so modutiles and various scripts
didn't find them...).
i think keeping the whole kernel, system.map and modules in one dir
tree would be better.  the current system strikes me as a gratuitous
spreading of stuff all over creation.  why isn't everything to do with
a kernel installation kept in one place?
1) stick the image, map ( initial ramdisks &c) into
   /boot/$(uname -r)
2) put modules in /boot/$(uname -r)/modules instead of
   /lib/modules/$(uname -r)
so for 2.2.17pre13 you'd have
/boot/2.2.17pre13/bzImage
/boot/2.2.17pre13/System.map
/boot/2.2.17pre13/modules/....
whether you use modules or not, i think it helps to bundle the image
and map and leave the filenames alone.
if you want a kernel include, make that dir/symlink
/boot/$(uname -r)/include
i'd be wanting to increase my /boot partition from 15MB to perhaps
20-30MB, but that's just small potatos.

it's only a cosmetic re-arrangement and wouldn't affect the kernel
itself.  otoh modutils and a few scripts depend upon the historical
placement of the modules.  i am not sure how painful that would be to
change.  i think a symlink
/lib/modules/$(uname -r) -> /boot/$(uname -r)/modules
would take care of most of it, no?
yet another little request -- can we number the new kernel with pre
patch too?  i am using 2.4.0-test5-pre5 but the -pre5 is gone from
uname -r.  i'd like to see -pre5 added to extraversion like the -acXX
stuff was.
