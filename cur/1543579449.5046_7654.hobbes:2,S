I completely agree, if we are talking about standard pc hardware. I was
more thinking about some dedicated hardware, where you want to get the
data directly to the correct place. If the hardware does a bit more with
the data you need large buffers. In a standard pc the main cpu does most
of the data processing, but in dedicated hardware you might have several
cards each with it's own logic and memory and here the cpu does manage
that stuff only. You can do all this of course from user space, but this
means you have to copy the data around, what you don't want with such
hardware, when the kernel can help you a bit.
bye, Roman
