Hello,
I have a problem related to Serial ATA : i have an Asus P4P800 Deluxe 
motherboard (ICH5) with 2xCD and 1xSATA HD.
I have the SATA HD working correctly but i can't get the CDs to work. If 
I compile both in the kernel I get :
handlers :
(ide_intr+0x0/0x1b4)
(ata_interrupt+0x0/0x1e8)
that is, both libata and old piix driver try to get access on CDs (as 
Jon Burgess kindly explained to me :)).
If I remove the piix then the system boots correctly.
Any idea on how to fix it ?
Another little thing : the HD activity LED is always on...
Raphaël Rigo.
