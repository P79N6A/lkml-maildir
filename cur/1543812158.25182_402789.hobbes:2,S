I have a dual core + HT platform. I disabled HT to have the same situation
as Dave.
ACPI DSDT dump shows 4 objects in \_PR scope as below.
    Scope (\_PR)
    {
        Processor (CPU0, 0x01, 0x00000410, 0x06) {}
        Processor (CPU1, 0x02, 0x00000410, 0x06) {}
        Processor (CPU2, 0x03, 0x00000410, 0x06) {}
        Processor (CPU3, 0x04, 0x00000410, 0x06) {}
    }
Only 2 are marked enabled in the ACPI MADT..
From boot log
ACPI: LAPIC (acpi_id[0x01] lapic_id[0x00] enabled)
Processor #0 15:4 APIC version 20
ACPI: LAPIC (acpi_id[0x03] lapic_id[0x02] enabled)
Processor #2 15:4 APIC version 20
ACPI: LAPIC (acpi_id[0x02] lapic_id[0x01] disabled)
ACPI: LAPIC (acpi_id[0x04] lapic_id[0x03] disabled)
But proc/acpi/processor also lists just 2 entries.
[root@araj-sfield-2 tmp]# ls /proc/acpi/processor/
CPU0  CPU2
I suspect that the BIOS is goofy and sending a valid acpiid when we try
to evaluate the processor object.
Could you see what comes out of the /proc/acpi/processor/CPUx/info for all the
3 listed in your system?
Also if you can send DSDT dump just to look over.
Cheers,
