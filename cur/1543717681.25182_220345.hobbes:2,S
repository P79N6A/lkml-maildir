Andrew,
I tested 2.6.6-mm2 this afternoon and twice I totally lost my keyboard. 
Everything else is working, I can rlogin, shutdown the system. It also
happens in console mode and looks like either keyboard irq or more 
likely its post processing just do not process queued characters.
I have nothing in dmesg nor in syslog. Attached in my .config.
