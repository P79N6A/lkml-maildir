Yep, this looks like a non issue when 2.6.18(-rcX?) comes out, and Ingo
updates his -rt patch against it.
I did say what I had wasn't the best and only a temporary fix.  But I
guess it can still work as a temporary solution until 2.6.18-rt1, where
we will have the fixes from Linus's tree.
Now maybe a copy of the arch/arm/common/dmabounce.c from git to Ingo's -rt
patch will work out of the box too. But I don't know what other changes
are dependent on that.
Thanks,
