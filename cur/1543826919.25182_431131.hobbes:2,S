I have four processes accessing the same file using mmap() with MAP_SHARED.
I'd like to take a copy-on-write snapshot of that file so that I can do a
backup. However, if I try to start a fifth process and map the file with
MAP_PRIVATE, the copy-on-write only works one way; i.e. changes made by the
other processes can be visible by the backup process.
How do you get the Linux VM to reverse the copy-on-write, where the four
original processes can keep sharing their data and the fifth backup process
retains the data made at the time of the snapshot?
Thanks,
  -Byron
