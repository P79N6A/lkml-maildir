Since very early 2.4 somewhere it has been impossible to use my two
wireless cards, a NetGear ME401 and a Lucent card (both
orinoco-based). Both are able to load the modules when pluggen in, but
trying to use them is futile, as nothing gets transmitted, and dmesg
show tons of this:
eth1: Station identity 001f:0006:0001:0003
eth1: Looks like an Intersil firmware version 1.03
eth1: Ad-hoc demo mode supported
eth1: IEEE standard IBSS ad-hoc mode supported
eth1: WEP supported, 104-bit key
eth1: MAC address 00:09:5B:27:DC:F9
eth1: Station name "Prism  I"
eth1: ready
eth1: index 0x01: Vcc 5.0, irq 6, io 0x0100-0x013f
NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth1: transmit timed out
eth1: Tx timeout! Resetting card. ALLOCFID=0128, TXCOMPLFID=0127, EVSTAT=800c
eth1: Error -110 writing packet to BAP
eth1: Error -110 writing Tx descriptor to BAP
eth1: Error -110 writing Tx descriptor to BAP
NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth1: transmit timed out
eth1: Tx timeout! Resetting card. ALLOCFID=0128, TXCOMPLFID=0127, EVSTAT=800c
The situation is similar for both cars, and I'm wondering if this is
a known broken setup, or I've messed up?
Currnently I'm on 2.4.20, tried both with and without the ACPI and
preempt patches (vmware deosnt make a difference either), the hardware
is a Compaq Evo n800c notebook and this is the cardbus bridge:
