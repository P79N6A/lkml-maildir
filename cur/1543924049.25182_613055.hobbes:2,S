Egads.  I knew I should've just kept that part out of it for the first
patch...
New patch on top of previous one is appended.
Thanks.

Typically, but when it doesn't, then the file capabilities shouldn't get
in the way of check_kill_permission() granting permission.  The file

No I was confused.  I wanted to allow for tasks with different uids.
But in fact that's not safe anyway.  A binary can be setuid and owned by
a non-root user user1, have file capabilities, and be executed by user2.
(Anyway given how grossly my code missed my erroneous intentions, I need
to add some signal tests to my file capabilities tests - and get those
tests into LTP)

Thanks, Stephen.

Subject: [PATCH 1/1] file capabilities: remove the non-matching uid special case for kill
There I went again having one patch do two (related) things.
Remove the special check I had added to cap_task_kill() for
non-matching uids.  In fact it turns out the check wouldn't be
safe even if I'd coded it correctly.  A binary can be setuid
and owned by a non-root user user1, have file capabilities, and
be executed by user2.
