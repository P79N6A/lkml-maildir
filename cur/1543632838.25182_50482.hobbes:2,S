I'm still confused about this... It suggests a sign error in a comparison 
somewhere, but I cannot for the life of me see where...
However I do see some cases where we should update timestamps on dentries, but 
are cleearly forgetting to do so. If this patch too leads to increased lookup 
rates...
Cheers,
