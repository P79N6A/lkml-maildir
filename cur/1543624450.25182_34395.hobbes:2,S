Subject: more unresolved symbols in 2.5.6

        Just going through the rest of the reports in my rolling of 2.5.6.
        With CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDECD=m, /sbin/depmod -ae -F System.map 2.5.6 from 
make modules_install comes back with:
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.5.6/kernel/drivers/ide/ide-cd.o
depmod:         ide_fops
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.5.6/kernel/drivers/net/tulip/de4x5.o
depmod:         virt_to_bus_not_defined_use_pci_map
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.5.6/kernel/sound/oss/sound.o
depmod:         virt_to_bus_not_defined_use_pci_map
        The virt_to_bus_not_defined_use_pci_map is known and is being worked 
on, AFAIK, but ide_fops is new. Poking around ide-cd.c, line 2514, is the only 
reference to it, inside a devfs_register() call. Leads me to assume that this 
would only show up, if CONFIG_DEVFS_FS is set to Y. Richard, any insights into 
this one? It looks like ide_fops may only need to be exported via ksyms.c, but 
I'd rather have a second opinion..
                                                        BL.
