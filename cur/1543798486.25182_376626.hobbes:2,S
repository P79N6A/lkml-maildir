Jsm driver is claimed to support Digi Neo multiport
serial boards but according to PCI id table
only 2port boards are supported.
Is it possible to support other Digi Neo boards by jsm
or original dgnc driver should be used instead?
Kconfig referred to Documentation/jsm.txt file
but it is not provided.
Please CC me.
