The search was a short one.  
2.6.9-rc1 works fine, just like 2.6.8.1
2.6.9-rc2 crashes.  I didn't find any kernel revisions between those two.
It is interesting to note that the 2.6.9 crash was a bit different.
X got a bit further according to the log.
During the test, everything stopped, but the machine wasn't completely
dead like it usually is.  Numlock actually toggled the LED, but the screen was 
black and I could not break out of X with ctrl+alt+backspace. So I tried to 
switch consoles, and the kernel died a bit more.  No more numlock LED
toggling, but sysrq+S+U+B actually worked.  The discs synced and
the thing booted.  Hm, perhaps  X always got a bit further, but
now the disc sync preserved more of the log?
Here is how it ended (I have all of it if necessary):
