Mark,

Nice, but nevertheless wrong theory.
This check is part of the RT-Patch and it _is_ entirely correct: 
Something tries to do a spin_lock() on a lock, which the same task has
already locked before. That's what the BUG_ON is catching.
There is nothing which can make a task magically the owner of a lock,
whether preemption is enabled or not.

Looks like the tunnel code is doing a nasty recursive thing. 
Dave, any idea ?
Mark, can you please turn on CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING. This should produce
more detailed information about the problem.
