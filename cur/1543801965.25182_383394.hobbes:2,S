You all seem to forget that dmix is in userspace in a different task
too.

No evident gain?  Wow.  What about:
- stopping crippling the OSS api
- having a real kernel api for which you can make different libraries
  depending on the need of the users
- stop making a fundamentally unsecure shared library mandatory
- opening the possibility of writing plugins to people without a PhD
  in lattice QCD.
and that's just a start.
  OG.
