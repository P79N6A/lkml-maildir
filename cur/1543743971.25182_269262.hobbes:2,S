  It will fail if you just simply walk namespace to find out 
the corresponding acpi object, because there are NO
hardware id or compatible id  can be passed in.
Please check function acpi_bus_match.
  The fundamental problem here is how to use device's geographical
address( or other information ) to locate the corresponding 
acpi object in namespace.
Thanks,
