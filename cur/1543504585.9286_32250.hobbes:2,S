If you think in real multiprocessor mode, then if two threads of your program
are running concurrently, then the fact that one is faulting does not impact
at the same time the other, so that the memory can be modified by the other
while the faulty one is handling the fault, which leads to a wrong core. So,
I think there is *NO* real solution for real synchronized faulting thread.

I have nothing against this patch (and really nothing if Linus puts it in
the standard kernel), except that
1) it unconditionally enforces the POSIX thread signal behaviour inside 
	the kernel (this could be avoided by having a new sysctl() for that).
2) it may mislead people working on a multiprocessor with a core that may not
	be the exact memory image when the thread actually faulted. (Is it
	acceptable that the kernel produce potential wrong core files ?).
