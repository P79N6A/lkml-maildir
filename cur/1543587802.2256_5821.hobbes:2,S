Call me old fashioned, but I prefer my bitmasks in hex.
Please also consider changing:
still_running:
	c = goodness(prev, this_cpu, prev->active_mm);
	next = prev;
to:
still_running:
	if (prev & (1 << this_cpu)) {
		c = goodness(prev, this_cpu, prev->active_mm);
		next = prev;
	}
Otherwise, you will keep scheduling a RT process forever on a
disallowed CPU on which it is already running.  And even a non-RT
process will stick on its disallowed CPU as long as nothing else runs
there.
Learnt this the hard way from the hotplug CPU patch...
Rusty.
