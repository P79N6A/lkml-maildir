Please could you rediff using the '-u' option and drop the MIME
attachment thingy (See Documentation/SubmittingPatches).
Patch otherwise looks quite correct, so once the patch format is OK
then, by all means send it off to Marcelo and (if you could bang up
the same patch for 2.5.x) to Linus too.
Cheers,
