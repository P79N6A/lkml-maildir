Subject: 3ware 9550SX problems - mke2fs incredibly slow writing last third of inode tables

I am having great difficulty getting a 3Ware 9550SX working.
I'm using 2.6.12 with EITHER the 2.6.14 driver, or the latest 3-ware driver
(2.26.04.006) from their web site, plus latest BIOS and firmware, on an
Dual AMD64 opteron 275 system.
I'm only not using 2.6.14 because compiling an ubuntu-boot-sequeunce
compatible kernel for AMD64 SMP is decidedly non-trivial (i.e. I have spent
the whole day doing it and failed dismally).
The RAID card is attached to a 4 x 512Gb SATA-II disk array in RAID-5
configuration (1.5Tb total)
All seems to go well until I try and do mke2fs. This appears to work,
and tries to write the inode tables. However, at (about) 3400 inodes
(of 11176), it slows to a crawl, writing one table every 10 seconds.
strace shows it is still running, and no errors are being reported.
However, it seems very sick.
No debug messages indicating any errors.
The only other clue as to what may be wrong is in the boot sequence.
I see lots of bad LUN messages (detail below). However, it does appear
to be detecting the disks right in the end.
Anyone got any ideas?
