Hi,

There is one major question: how will this interface to distributions?
How can distributions add their own initializations and configurations or 
are they going to put an initrd on top of the kernel initrd? If this will 
have a kernel and a distribution part, it poses the question whether klibc 
has to be distributed with the kernel at all (a libc has a standard API 
after all) and the kernel just provides the kernel specific parts to 
whatever the distribution provides.
bye, Roman
