SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN *is* effectively a maybe align flag given the above 
code. 
If we all agree then we could change this to have must have semantics? It 
has the potential of enlarging objects for small caches. 
SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN has an effect that varies according to the alignment 
requirements of the architecture that the kernel is build on. We may be in 
for some surprises if we change this.
