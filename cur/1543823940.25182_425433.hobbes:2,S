Subject: [PATCH 0/6] Support scatter/gather I/O in NFS direct I/O path
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/19/139

These patches add support for asynchronous scatter/gather I/O to the NFS
direct I/O engine.  They will apply cleanly to 2.6.17-rc4-mm1 with Badari's
API changes already applied.
Christoph, Badari, Trond, and Zach have already seen these at least once, but
they are in need of wider review and testing.  I'd welcome their inclusion in
an mm kernel.
