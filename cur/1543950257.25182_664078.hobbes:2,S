Use of NR_CPUS is usually wrong.  In this case it seems you should be using
for_each_possible_cpu().
Also the existing usage of NR_CPUS in relay_subbufs_consumed() should be
switched to using cpu_possible().
New usage of NR_CPUS might be checkpatch-worthy, actually:
akpm:/usr/src/25> grep -l '^+.*NR_CPUS' patches/*.patch 
patches/ext4-mm-mballoc-core.patch
patches/git-kvm.patch
patches/git-perfmon.patch
patches/relay-reset-consumed.patch
patches/x86-andi-git-x86.patch
patches/x86-andi-smp-switch-optimize.patch
that's a sample of 1852 patches.
An appropriate warning would be "Usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - should
you be using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(),
etc?".
