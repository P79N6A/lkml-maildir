But this add complexity for optimization of the epsilon, in my opinion. 
There is some other way to trash L1 cache as walking a too long list. Each
indirection can trash at least one cache line and sometimes far more due
to accessing data outside this first cache line in order to make decision.

Zeroing a datum that will likely stay so is overhead, but when this zeroed
datum will be filled by real information later, then the zeroing is close
to zero-cost compared to the computation of this information and the
change of the previous zero value.
Unless you want to perform everything from kernel-land, being a bit smart
or just not stupid regarding useless zeroing of data should make such a
load negligible compared to the actual load of the system and user
applications, in my opinion.
Fine design is far better at avoiding overhead that brute-force
optimisation in my opinion.

Who want to ever read data he already knows about the actual value ? ;-)
