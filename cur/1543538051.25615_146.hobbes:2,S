Of course I thought about this:
that's why I included a version which uses only RTC in the 
latencytest package. (notice that it uses aync SIGIO notifications
which are not in 2.2 by default (2.4 contains the RTC SIGIO patch) )
here you see a RTC latencytest using a 2048HZ RTC frequency
(lowlatency kernel)
http://www.gardena.net/benno/linux/audio/rtc2048-cpu80/2048.html
as you can notice the max latency drift is about 500usecs under high
load.  
no soundcard , no ALSA installed nothing, all you need is the RTC clock.
This is to cut out any disturbing issue, (like potential flaky
sounddrivers),
but trust me the problem _IS_ the scheduling.
BTW: I should really rewrite latencytest (it was a quick hack)
from scratch in order to include RTC using blocking reads and other interesting
stuff I have in mind, hopefully before the next century.

nice.
can you tell use what you want to investigate in particular ?
Benno.
