I don't know if this is the same thing I saw in the 2.2.2pre2, but I
got a couple of weird OOPSen which had corrupted, partial OOPS reports
in the syslog. My OOPS problem seems to have gone away in 2.2.{2,3},
but there may be some conditions under which only part of the oops is
logged... in my case, I got a bunch of NULLs followed by the bottom
half of an OOPS in syslog. For reference, this was debian 2.1 as of
mid-Feb...
So un-harsh a bit-- maybe there is only half an OOPS. Catalin?
For reference, look for this message:

in the archives, if anyone wants to see my half-oops. It's in
kernel.9902.2 on the indiana list archive.
