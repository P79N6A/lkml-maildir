Subject: Does Kernel 2.6.6 support more than 32 groups?

We need a Linux kernel to support more than 32 groups.
The 2.6.6 kernel source file include/linux/limits.h
contains the line:
define NGROUPS_MAX    65536  /* supplemental group   
IDs are available*/
I also changed 
#define NGROUPS_SMALL  32 
to 
#define NGROUPS_SMALL   256
in include/linux/sched.h file.
 
But when I compiled it on Redhat Enterprise Linux 3.0
(with glibc-2.3.2-95.20) it still gives 32 group
limitation. What else do I need to change? Do I need
to modify glibc? If so how?
I'd appreciate your help.
Brian
