The idea is:
Task may be "the entity that allocates the resources" and "the
entity that is a resource allocated".
When task is the first entity it may move across containers
(that is implemented in your patches). When task is a resource
it shouldn't move across containers like files or pages do.
More generally - allocated resources hold reference to original
container till they die. No resource migration is performed.
Did I express my idea cleanly?
