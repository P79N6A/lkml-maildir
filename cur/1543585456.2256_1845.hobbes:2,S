Subject: Some strange patch to drivers/input/keybdev.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Some guy sent me the attached patch. He says it allows
him to use 2 additional keys on the 106 key USB keyboard.
I never saw a 106 key keyboard before, USB or not.
Does anyone understand what is going on? Vojtech?
