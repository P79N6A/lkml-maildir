How about limiting the global size of the dcache in this case ? 
I cannot imagine a workload where it would make sense to ever cache 
500 million dentries. It just risks to keep the whole file system
after an updatedb in memory on a big box, which is not necessarily
good use of the memory.
Limiting the number of dentries would keep the hash chains at a 
reasonable length too and somewhat bound the worst case CPU 
use for cache misses and search time in cache lookups.
