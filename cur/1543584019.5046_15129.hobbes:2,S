Hi
Hm, ok, let me be the first to reply to you, although I am far not a good
specialist in this area, I just hope to provoke somebody to give more
professional answers to your problem:-)
1) Try using dd to copy your entire disk to another one (if that's
possible), it anyway would be a good starting point, I guess. Smth. like
(boot from a floppy, supposing your damaged drive is hda and you copy it
to hdb)
dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/hdb
2) ok, now that we have (hopefully) preserved what was possible we can
attempt more risky steps: while booted from a floppy do
mount -r /dev/hda /mnt
and see what's left on your drive...
3) Now you can attempt various fsck's, but be warned - this is where you
already CAN make matters worse... First umount
umount /dev/hda
then smth like
e2fsck /dev/hda
...
Good luck
Guennadi
P.S. Hey, guys, I know it's a bit off-topic here, but some (all?) of you
can help this chap out better than me - please correct what I've said
wrong.
