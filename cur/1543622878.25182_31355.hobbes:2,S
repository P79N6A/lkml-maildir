	Hi,
	Trying to validate IrDA with 2.5.6-pre1 (I guess, that's my
job). I got some socket OOPS in a place where everything was smooth
before.
	It seems that check_irq_holder() in include/asm/smplock.h is
failing and generate the Oops. Basically, it complain when
interruptible_sleep_on() is called with interrupts disabled (fair
enough).
	The offending code in net/irda/af_irda.c look like this :
--------------------------------------
	cli();	/* To avoid races on the sleep */
	
	/* A Connect Ack with Choke or timeout or failed routing will go to
	 * closed.  */
	while (sk->state == TCP_SYN_SENT) {
		interruptible_sleep_on(sk->sleep);
		if (signal_pending(current)) {
			sti();
			return -ERESTARTSYS;
		}
	}
	
	if (sk->state != TCP_ESTABLISHED) {
		sti();
		sock->state = SS_UNCONNECTED;
		return sock_error(sk);	/* Always set at this point */
	}
	
	sock->state = SS_CONNECTED;
	
	sti();
--------------------------------------
	Wow ! This is far beyond my usual level of evil !
	My guess is that this was a cut'n'paste of some TCP code (or
else), and while this other code was fixed/cleaned up, IrDA kept the
old version.
	So, if anybody remember having seen that and could tell me how
it was fixed, that would make my day...
	Thanks...
	Jean
