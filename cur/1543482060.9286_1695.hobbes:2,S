Hi Ulrich,
The distribution shouldn't have such a /usr/include/linux symlink at
all.
Files for the target computer (most of the files) should not use any
files in /usr/include at all.  You can almost build the kernel with
"-nostdinc", except that some files do #include <stdarg.h>, which lives
in a gcc-lib directory rather than /usr/include.  If someone could handle
that issue, I think "-nostdinc" would be a good thing; it would catch
some dumb #include errors.
Files to be built on the host, such as scripts/mkdep.c, are ordinary
userland C apps.  They can also #include <linux/*.h> files to get at
structures definitions, but because of the "-I" flags, these will
get resolved out of /usr/src/linux/include with no need for a
symlink.
Michael
