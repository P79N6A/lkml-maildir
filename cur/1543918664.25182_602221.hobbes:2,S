| or use it to compare with some other value (so they will 
| work the same for both NULL and dummy pids).
| 
| This saves up to 340 bytes for i386 kernel with minimal 
| config  and probably more with more users of pids.

| Tested on i386 and x86_64 boxes. Tasks still live and die,
| namespaces and proc still work.
