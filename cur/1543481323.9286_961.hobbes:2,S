The 2.0.37pre4 kernel that I built this evening crashes during the initial
boot-up.  It dies here:
SCSI device sdd: hdwr sector= 512 bytes. Sectors= 4178874 [2040 MB] [2.0 GB]
PPP: version 2.2.0 (dynamic channel allocation)
TCP compression code copyright 1989 Regents of the University of California
PPP Dynamic channel allocation code copyright 1995 Caldera, Inc.
PPP line discipline registered.
SLIP: version 0.8.4-NET3.019-NEWTTY (dynamic channels, max=256).
SLIP linefill/keepalive option.

eth0: 3c509 at 0x250 tag 1, 10baseT port, address  00 c0 4f d9 79 7f, IRQ 10.

Partition check:
 sda: sda1 sda2
The " sda1 sda2" never prints.
sda is on an Adaptec board, and my guess is that this is the first time that
the Adaptec driver tries to read the disk.  I knew that the driver changed
between pre3 and pre4, so I grafted the pre4 changes back into pre3, and the
resulting kernel worked (for the last 15 minutes, anyway).
I'm willing to supply more info if anyone is interested, but since there
is no logging active at this point, I will need either a pointer to info
on how to get the traceback in machine readable form (this case is not
covered in oops-tracing.txt) or some time and a pencil and paper...
