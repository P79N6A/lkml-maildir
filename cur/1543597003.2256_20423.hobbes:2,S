Jens, I think Dipankar might have stated my comment about questioning
optimal utilization of a pool of resources shared by all device queues in
the last sentence of the above paragraph. 
My thought was that if one has enough IO that cannot be merged on a queue
you eat up request descriptors. If a request queue contains more requests
than can be put in flight by the lower level to a spindle than this
resource might be better used by other request queues.
I might be missing something and I will look at the code some more.
Thanks.
