4 are almost as good - and they also solve the 0x40 problem.

well, i think i have to agree ... if it wasnt for Wine's 0x40 descriptor.  
But it certainly does not come free. We could have 3 TLS entries (0x40
will be the last entry), and the copying cost is 9 cycles. (compared to 6
cycles in the 2 entries case.) Good enough?
