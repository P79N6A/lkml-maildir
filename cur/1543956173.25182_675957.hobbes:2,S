I think we need to defer the Tulip davicom ID removal patch, because
the tulip driver is the only one that works on sparc64 for davicom
chips, dmfe does not.
That's a regression, so I can't pull this in as-is.
I'm happy to discuss the davicom+sparc64 issue, but for now if
you could simply give me a tree which contains the other
bug fixes we can integrate those now.
Thanks!
