Well, that *is* the normal thing on x86.
HOWEVER, I think the right thing for allyesconfig, allmodconfig, 
randconfig, etc. is to be able to override specific variables.  Right 
now, one has to use indirection via a file, which is a bit clumsy; it 
would be better if one could do "make allyesconfig CONFIG_X86_64=y" or 
somesuch.
In fact, we should be able to get rid of ARCH entirely;  CONFIG_ options 
have the huge advantage that they're saved in a file, and you don't have 
to type them on every make run. The only option that I can't see us 
getting rid of easily is HOSTCC, since it is used before config is run, 
but probably something clever can be done there, too.
