I see much overlap here too. Wouldn't it be nice to see the transport
part of the connector code to be implemented as a generic netlink
multicast? We already have uni- and broadcast for netlink.
Isn't the whole purpose of the connector to hook in notifications that
act only if someone is listening? That is a perfect multicast case. :)
At the time we added kobject_uevent I was missing something like this.
The broadcast groups did not really fit, and we decided not to use them,
and unicast wasn't a option here.
Thanks,
Kay
