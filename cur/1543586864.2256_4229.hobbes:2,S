What about common config options (like CONFIG_PCI, CONFIG_BINFMT_ELF,
CONFIG_SMP, CONFIG_SERIAL), which have Configure.help entries wtitten in
PC-centric style?
What is info about ISA/EISA bus for sparc users for? Why no info about SBUS
there?
What is COM3 for Amiga user?
How can alpha user compile kernel for Pentium?
What is the difference between ELF and A.OUT for architectures that do not
support a.out at all?
IMO some, even very standard, options may need different explanations for
different architectures.
Maybe some kind of architecture-specyfic #include in Configure.help entries?
Just my 0.03 PLZ
