Yes. However, even if you just end up summarizing the current outstanding 
issues (and are not able to necessarily point to the right person), I 
suspect that all the top-level maintainers would be interested in it. As 
long as it's a "summary report twice a week" kind of thing.
In fact, I suspect a lot of non-maintainers would be interested too!
And if you then have some way for people to add commentary (and directing) 
to entries, you might start out not knowing where some bugreport should 
go, but you'll have people able to forward them.
I end up doing that fairly regularly - adding people to the Cc when I'm 
involved in a bug, and we suddenly notice that "hey, it looks like it's a 
timer" issue or something, and we end up adding Ingo and Thomas Gleixner 
to the cc.
This, btw, is why email is *so* much nicer than a web interface. A web 
interface is always "a single person looking at it". An email, on the 
other hand, is always "you can bounce it to make _another_ person look at 
it".
But I agree that the more involved in the kernel the initiating person has 
been (at least to *some* degree), the better. No question. I just don't 
think it necessarily needs to be a hugely core person. Anybody who has 
been reading lkml for the last few months will already know a lot of the 
people involved in different subsystems!
