Is the comment actually valid? From arch/x86/kernel/irq_32.c:
do_softirq() actually does
                curctx = current_thread_info();
                irqctx = softirq_ctx[smp_processor_id()];
                irqctx->tinfo.task = curctx->task;
and so does execute_on_irq_stack().
So kernel_locked() should be valid. It corresponds to the thread
that is being interrupted.
And answering an earlier question, this happens only on i386 and only
with 4K stacks because x86_64 dosn't have a separate softirq stack,
so the preempt count diring the soft irq is at least IRQ_EXIT_OFFSET.
(If I understood the things correctly)
