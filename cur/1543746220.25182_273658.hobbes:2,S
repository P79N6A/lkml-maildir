Just did a build with -V0.7.30-2 and was about to start testing when
the system locked up (no keyboard response, display frozen, etc.). No
response to Alt-SysRq keys. No messages on the serial console (other than
those showing a normal boot / telinit 5). Kernel was PREEMPT_RT plus a
patch to profile on NMI, not timer (been using this latter one for some
time). Basically same .config as previously provided but can send if
needed. Boot parameters included serial console, profile=2, nmi_watchdog.
Will retry shortly, but the steps leading to the failure were:
 - boot single user
 - telinit 5
 - su'd 3 times
 - created directories to log data / moved some files around
 - set IRQ threads, ksoftirqd/[01], events/[01] to RT fifo 99 priority
 - started two monitoring scripts (looking at latency & profile data)
 - cat /proc/sys/kernel/preempt_wakeup_timing (was 1)
 - echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/preempt_wakeup_timing [entered, but display
was frozen at this point and did not see newline nor any further output]
