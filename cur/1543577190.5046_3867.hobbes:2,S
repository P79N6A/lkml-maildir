Hi,
	In the function ip_build_xmit(), immediately after
sk_alloc_send_skb(), skb_reserve(skb, hh_len) is called. Now
skb_reserve(skb,len) only increment the data pointer and tail pointer by 
len amt.
	Now in a particular hard_start_xmit() say for rtl8139, the data
transfer is taking place from skb->data :
	outl(virt_to_bus(skb->data), ioaddr + TxAddr0 + entry*4)
So, I cannot understand, if transfer starts from data and not head, is
ethrnet header not transmitted? what I am missing?
