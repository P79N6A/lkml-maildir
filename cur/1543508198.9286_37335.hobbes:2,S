Hi
I am working on a PCI device driver in Linux.
I am trying to map 128MB PCI memory space to virtual address of Pentium
CPU.
I am observing that ioremap() call returns only PAGE ALIGNED virtual
address. My device driver requires the virtual address to be 128MB
aligned! (I need the virtual address start in the form  - xxxx x000 0000
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 (given in binary       x-dont care).
How do I ensure it in Linux? Can anybody help me?
Thanks,
Murthy
