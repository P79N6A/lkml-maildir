I might be nice to have something like a copy-block where the
application writes/reads data, while the device does DMA only from/to
there. We would need an easy way to mmap some anonymous DMA-ready memory
in user-space, and something to give the corresponding DMA addresses to
the application.
Additionally, the current code might not be flexible enough regarding
acknowledging of interrupts. It might be good to use the bit that PCI
2.2 defines in the config space to mask/unmask interrupt in a generic
way. Something like : when an interrupt comes, the driver mask the
interrupts using this bit, and then passes the event to user-space. The
user-space interrupt handler acknowledges the interrupt with the device
specific code, and then unmask with the PCI 2.2 bit.
