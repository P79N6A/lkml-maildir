There were a few BUG_ON calls in scsi_glue.c and in transport.c that
killed machines. For transport.c my source has
        if (len != srb->request_bufflen) {
                printk("USB transport.c: len=%d srb->request_bufflen=%d\n",
                       len, srb->request_bufflen);
#if 0
                show_trace(NULL);
#endif
        }
(show_trace was not defined here; I think the call should be deleted).
With some luck Alan's fix means that the ones in usb_stor_abort_transport()
and [us_]release() are not triggered anymore.
