If you want to try it, you are looking for IOSYNC (not medio_delay)
in this driver. However, doing this can break write ordering and thus
any driver you are treating that way.

For the Rhine, there is, but making it work requires some extra black
magic we didn't know until a few months ago. It's fixed in -mm now and
will probably be in 2.6.9. That doesn't mean the media_check is gone,
though. It just means it only happens on actual events.
