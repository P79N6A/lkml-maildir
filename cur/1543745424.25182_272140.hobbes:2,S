this shows that we interrupted some longer critical section - in this
case it seems to be BIOS/APM code.

that jump is a delayed interrupt hitting the BIOS on its way out of APM
idle mode it seems:

There's nothing to be done about that, except to disable APM. Perhaps
you could try ACPI, maybe that doesnt have such latencies in the BIOS.
