Subject: capable open_port() check wrong for kmem

hi all,
	I found that I can't open /dev/kmem O_RDONLY.  The open_mem
and open_kmem calls (open_port()) in drivers/char/mem.c checks for
CAP_SYS_RAWIO.
	Is there a possibility of splitting that off into a read and
write pair, i.e. CAP_SYS_RAWIO_WRITE, CAP_SYS_RAWIO_READ?
	If not, is there a way to grant read-only access to /dev/kmem?
