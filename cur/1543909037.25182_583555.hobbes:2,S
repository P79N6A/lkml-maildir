Hi all!
Starting with 2.6.23-rc3 the battery from my laptop (Acer TM3012) is
missing for linux (but not physically):
ACPI: AC Adapter [ACAD] (on-line)
ACPI: Battery Slot [BAT1] (battery absent)
But it is definitely there and running, even when I unplug the AC power.
Any patch I can use to change this?
Best wishes
Norbert

GLOSSOP (n.)
A rouge blob of food. Glossops, which are generally streaming hot and
highly adhesive invariably fall off your spoon and on to the surface
of your host's highly polished antique-rosewood dining table. If this
has not, or may not have, been noticed by the company present, swanage
(q.v.) may be employed.
