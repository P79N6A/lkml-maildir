Subject: [PATCH] Fix uninitialized local variable "covered" in i386 acpi-cpufreq driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/26/456

The local variable "covered" is used without initialization in i386 acpi-cpufreq
driver. The initial value of covered should be 0. The bug will cause memory leak
when hit. The following patch fixes this bug.
