You're not reporting that it fails to activate when there's an
active device connected; and you obviously enabled CONFIG_PM,
which Kconfig says means that
	... parts of your computer are shut off or put into a
	power conserving "sleep" mode if they are not being used.
So:  since it's not being actively used then, why shouldn't the
root hub (or any other device) be suspended?  During boot, or at
any other time.  So long as it works when you plug in a USB device,
it looks to me like everything is behaving quite reasonably.

I've never observed "lsusb" ever timing out when accessing a
suspended USB device; the URB submissions fail right away.
So if something's timing out, it's for some other reason.
(Such as bugs in "lsusb"; the "usbutils" package is overdue
for a new release, it's changed a lot since the 0.11 tarball
that's widely available.)
