Thanks very much for your taking time to think about my problem. Here are 
answers to your questions.
>
>  1. Are you running an i386 kernel or an x86_64 kernel?
I think, I am running a x86_64 kernel.  I think so, because I had asked the 
vendor of the machine to install x86_64 and because the file
System.map-2.6.11.4-21.7-smp 
in the /boot directory has an entry: ffffffff804f0000 T x86_64_start_kernel
and that directory also contains the gzipped file:
 symvers-2.6.11.4-21.7-x86_64-smp.gz
The operating system is Linux version 2.6.11.4-21.7-smp (geeko@buildhost)  
(gcc version 3.3.5 20050117 (prerelease) (SUSE Linux)) #1 SMP Thu Jun 2

The BIOS is AMIBIOS version is 08.00.10 with the build date of 02/11/05 
09:44:04 and has the ID:  0AAAA001.

>  3. Is node interleaving enabled in the BIOS?
When I go through the BIOS setup, I do not see any choice for the node 
interleaving ON or OFF. However, I think that the two CPUs (as node0 and 
node1) are made NUMA aware by default, but I could be quite wrong. 
Out of ignorance, therefore,  the following are the contents of 
 /sys/devices/system/node/node0/numastat &
numa_hit 3620274
numa_miss 0
numa_foreign 0
interleave_hit 21903
local_node 3610298agravaited
other_node 9976
Similarly, following are the  the contents of
  /sys/devices/system/node/node1/numastat
numa_hit 3089426
numa_miss 0
numa_foreign 0
interleave_hit 38355
local_node 3072605
other_node 16821
