Are you referring to cleanup of ACPI P-state driver by Dominik?
That patch is indeed nice and clean. But that is mostly 
orthogonal to this patch. I mean, 
- SMP awareness in P-state driver 
- P-state coordination between HT siblings
will still be required even after Dominik's patch. Though exact 
location of these changes will change when applied over Dominik's 
patch.
There is a small overlap in handling MSR based P-state transitions, 
but that is a real minor change in my patch and I am reusing most 
of the existing IO based transitions code for MSR based ones.

I am sorry. I do not understand this comment. 
- Major part of Patch 1 is adding SMP awareness, which has
nothing specific to Intel at all.
- A part of patch 1 adds MSR based transition capability. 
This is based on ACPI spec. It will work any processor 
that is ACPI compatible and again there are no specific 
checks for Intel here.

Thanks.
