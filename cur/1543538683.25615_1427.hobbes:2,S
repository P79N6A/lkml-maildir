I've been able to reproduce it on i386, by selecting the following as
modules:
Joystick support
ns558 gameports
Classic PC analog joysticks and gamepads
Microsoft SideWinder digital joysticks and gamepads
Then after trying to select USB support compiled into the kernel, it
reverts it to USB support as a module for some odd reason.
