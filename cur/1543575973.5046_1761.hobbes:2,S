Thanks for all the reponses.
I happened to have /home in its own partition, so I reinstalled from
scratch via CD and installed all the security updates, among a
myriad of other security measures.
I decided not to restore /usr/local from backups, but instead to
rebuild everything in /usr/local from fresh sources.
All those executables and shared libraries in /usr/local just seemed
to risky.
