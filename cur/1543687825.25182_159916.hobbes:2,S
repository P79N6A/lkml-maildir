But it does not have to verify the mask each and every mapping call
currently.  We'll need to do that with your suggested changes.
Nobody is going to agree to any of your proposals at the rate you're
currently going.

Effectively, the correct effects are obtained on i386, Alpha,
IA64, and sparc for all drivers in the tree.  I can say this because
nobody tries to do anything interesting with consistent_dma_mask
yet, and that is why nobody has any incentive to "fix" it as you
keep complaining we need to do.
See, to show something is broken, you have to show a device that
will break currently.  The consistent_dma_mask is only modified
by tg3, and it does so in such a way that all platforms work properly.
