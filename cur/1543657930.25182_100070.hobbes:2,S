That's not a problem: the exception table search code looks like:
/* Given an address, look for it in the exception tables. */
const struct exception_table_entry *search_exception_tables(unsigned long addr)
{
	const struct exception_table_entry *e;
	e = search_extable(__start___ex_table, __stop___ex_table-1, addr);
	if (!e)
		e = search_module_extables(addr);
	return e;
}
search_extable is arch specific, and requires no setup on any arch.
The list containing the modules is initialized using the LIST_HEAD, so
is empty, so search_module_extables is a noop.

Once again, no initialization required.  "symbol_init" initializes the
EXPORT'ed symbol tables for module loading: kallsyms doesn't need
initialization.

Yes, because archs iterated through the extable list to find even core
kernel exception tables.  The patch changes that: the lookup for core
kernel is done first, then the module code looks through a linked
list, meaning you don't need an extable list for !CONFIG_MODULES, etc.
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
