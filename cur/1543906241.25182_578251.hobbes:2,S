Subject: [PATCH -mm 0/3] Freezer: Use wait queue instead of busy looping
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
The patches in the next three messages do the following:
* make the freezer a bit more verbose
* make try_to_freeze_tasks() go to sleep while waiting for tasks to enter
  the refrigerator instead of busy looping
* make try_to_freeze_tasks() measure the time of freezing, regardless of
  whether or not it is successful
Greetings,
Rafael
