When you are I/O bound the page-fault rate is very very low and IMHO you
are not going to see any sensitive improvement. clear page become a
bottleneck only when the page fault rate is high.
Actually on x86 doing it in software would be a bad idea anyway as
currently there's no way to avoid cache pollution (and I don't have KNI
here). perloading cachelines at page fault time is the best thing to do
for x86 right now.

I understand as I don't use -j5 either ;). I tune -j to make sure all CPUs
are busy all the time and nothing more.
