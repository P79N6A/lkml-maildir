I wonder that noone rospond. I can confirm this - in 2.2.x links to cwd,
exe etc. pointed to nowhere (readlink failed) when there was insufficient
privileges to enter the dir. In 2.4.x the links blindly points to directory
setting all its privileges for access by /proc. Because everyone has dirs
drwxr-xr-x in his home, such dirs now become accesible through /proc if user
is in them. This is real security leak. 
ex:
[johnydog@napalm 210]$ whoami
johnydog
[johnydog@napalm 210]$ pwd
/proc/210
[johnydog@napalm 210]$ ls -l ./cwd
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            0 Nov  6 01:26 ./cwd -> /root/.mc
[johnydog@napalm 210]$ cd /root/.mc
bash: /root/.mc: Permission denied
[johnydog@napalm 210]$ cd cwd
[johnydog@napalm cwd]$ ls -l
