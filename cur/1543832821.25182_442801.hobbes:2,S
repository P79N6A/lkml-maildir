How about the use of lock/unlock_kernel(). Is there some hidden global
synchronization going on? Every time lock/unlock_kernel() is used
there is a tty_struct available. My first thought would be to turn
this into a per tty spinlock. Looking at where it is used it looks
like it was added to protect all of the VFS calls. I see no obvious
coordination with other ttys that isn't handled by other locks.
