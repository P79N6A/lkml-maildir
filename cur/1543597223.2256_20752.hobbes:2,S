Well, you can either use the fs_struct from init, or that of the first
process to call nfsd. I'm not sure if there's any real point in having
a chrooted nfsd, but it's easy to implement.
In either case, the principle is the same: use copy_fs_struct() on
whatever you want to clone, then have all the nfsd daemons and the
lockd daemon attach to the new shared fs_struct when they get set up.
No need to replace daemonize...
Cheers,
