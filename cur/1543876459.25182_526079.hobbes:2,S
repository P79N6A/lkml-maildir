Interesting.  The first number corresponds with the ACPI THM0
temperature, but I can't see anything corresponding to THM1.  Is there
something that documents what all the temperatures are measuring in an
X60?  Thinkwiki doesn't seem to have any info.
ezr:pts/1; cat /proc/acpi/ibm/thermal
temperatures:   72 55 -128 65 40 -128 35 -128 51 53 -128 -128 -128 -128
-128 -128

It's set to auto.  Presumably that means its tied into the temperature
sensors and will be able to keep the temp under control...
