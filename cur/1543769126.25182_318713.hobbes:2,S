Hi Adrian,
I'll apply this patch if you comment out or use "#if 0" on the exported
symbols.  Also do not remove isapnp_read_byte or pnp_auto_config_dev because
they are part of the device driver API.  I would like you to only target the
protocol API.  I'll have the time to seriously work on features like modular
isapnp in about a week.
Thanks,
Adam
