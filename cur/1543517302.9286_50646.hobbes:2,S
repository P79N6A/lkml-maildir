it's very much intact. The swap cache is embedded in the pagecache and
serves as a fast-lookup for recently swapped out pages. It's a 'backside'
cache to the swap device itself. A swapped out page is only truly freed
once it's evicted from the swap cache as well. The swap cache enables us
to do more aggressive and asynchronous swap-out - if we got it wrong (and
the page is faulted in before it's completely freed) we only take a minor
page fault to establish the mapping again.
