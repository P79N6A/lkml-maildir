I don't think (a) is an issue; /bin/mount is not a big program.  I don't
think that my (admittedly limited) version would require that many
changes.

That would be nice, but may complicate things unneccesarily.  In the
general case, you may have to worry about garbage-collecting parts of
the filesystem that are now unreachable, and that would be majorly
painful.

I actually think that an nfsroot.gz initrd would do everything the
current kernel mechanism does.

exec() init works just fine.  I have used it.  I don't think there is
any need to put that in kernel space.
