Currently I am working on a project involving a system running Linux in an
embedded environement that is booted from network and therefore running
without virtual memory.
If I just let the system sit around with almost no activity at all (except for
a cron without any jobs etc.) I see the memory usage rise very slowly which
ultimately leads to the systems grinding halt after about 50 hours on a 64M
system.
As the memory used by the various processes does not increase enough to
explain the overall increasing memory usage I suspect the kernel of leaking
memory.
Here's an overview of the setup:
- AMD K6 II
- 64M of physical memory
- 8M ramdisk
- Linux 2.2.6 statically built
- RealTek RTL8139 NIC driver
Processes using significant amounts of memory:
- XF86_SVGA (4.8M)
- xterm     (1.7M)
- xfs       (1.1M)
- fvwm      (920K)
After the system's startup the memory usage looks like this:
- free:    27M
- shared:  9.6M
- buffers: 10M
- cached:  20M
The amount of memory used slowly increases thereafter ultimately leading to
the system's halt.
Any hints on how to further investigate on this problem would be very much
appreaciated.
