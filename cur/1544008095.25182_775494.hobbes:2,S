Using v4l2_i2c_new_subdev or v4l2_i2c_new_probed_subdev should make it 
much easier to switch over. It certainly simplified it for ivtv.

I would like to state again that I have no plans to rename it. There is 
a chance that it will be used by the dvb subsystem as well in the 
future, but that's not going to happen any time soon. But should that 
happen, then we might consider renaming it to 
media_device/media_subdev. However, right now it is very much v4l2 
specific code. I think it more likely that if this is used in dvb then 
it would be for v4l2 functionality, not dvb functionality.
There will definitely be future additions since this is only the first 
step. Things on my list: better framework support for controls, 
v4l2_prio handling, adding a similar v4l2_fh struct for 
filehandle-specific data and the media controller which has been 
discussed in earlier RFCs and that requires these fundamental data 
structs to be in place first.
Replacing the v4l2-int-device.h API with v4l2_subdev and adding support 
for sensor drivers to the v4l2_subdev ops will also no doubt require 
additions.
But I want to do this step by step. It's just humanly impossible to go 
for a Big Bang here. Each time something gets added there must be at 
least one driver actually using it so you have some confidence in the 
change. Just integrating these simple v4l2_device and v4l2_subdev 
structs will take a fair amount of time.
