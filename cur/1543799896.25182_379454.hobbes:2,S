Incidentally, while using mutt would be so much better, this is a
handy technique for those trapped behind a firewall with http proxy
who don't want to draw the ire of sysadmins by tunnelling.  Thought
I'd share since I did it expressly for sending patches:
1. Set up webmail.
2. Hack webmail to use wrap="off" on the textareas.
3. Use mosex or similar to have $YOUR_X11_EDITOR for editing textareas.
