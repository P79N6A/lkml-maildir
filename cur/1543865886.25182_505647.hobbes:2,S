That's correct. There should be developers across many regions. For
example, PC growth has the highest in Asia - so more users - hence the
demand for device support !
Plus, there is huge demand coming in 2 important areas - Embedded &
Mobile space.

I would love to work on PC as well as Embedded stuff (Power, Intel, and ARM).
Devices types - Audio/Video (this needs special attention for the
Linux Desktop), USB (TV Tuner card, key for Linux Desktop), Bluetooth
(Mobiles) , GSM/GPRS/WiFi/WIMAX (my self R&D area).  Plus any device
which we think important to boost Linux Desktop ;-)
