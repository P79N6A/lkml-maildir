I have heard from the Atlas linear algebra folks the following:
1. For compiling Atlas, both on Athlons and Pentia, GCC 2.95.x produces
*significantly* faster operation than either 3.0.x or 2.96.x
2. For IA64, the reverse is true: GCC 3.0.x produces significantly faster
code.
I can dig up the URL for the mailing list if anyone cares for the details.
