The following patch attempts to avoid the race condition identified in
my last message.  I have applied it to my kernel and it appears to fix
the problem; I never saw a successful shutdown before applying this
patch (four consecutive failures), and I have performed four
successful shutdowns since.
I am not terribly happy with this fix, since (in principle) it allows
another very busy device on the same IRQ to block the free_irq() call
indefinitely.  This could be fixed by using a per-device "busy" flag
instead of per-interrupt, but I will leave such wizardry to the
wizards.
