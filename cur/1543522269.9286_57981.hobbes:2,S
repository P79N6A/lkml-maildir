Define "well".  I have media one service because it
is the only service I can get at my apartment with
speeds > 28.8 (media one cable modem).  The phones
in my apartment run over media one cable, and I've
never been able to get better than 28.8 on them 
(and I'd still want greater than 56.6 speeds anyway).
Sure, you can say I chose my apartment poorly too,
but...
-Richard.
