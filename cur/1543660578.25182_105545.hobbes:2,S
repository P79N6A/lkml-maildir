One of the first implementations of VM was by IBM, called CP/67.  It
eventually evolved into VM/370 and its follow-ons.
The initial design reason for CP/67 was to allow 2 or more MVS development
teams to share a system for testing, so the other team could keep working
while the first team debugged a system crash with tools better than the
lights-n-switches at the console.
It turns out that the 99% of the work to cover the 1% of the cases is really
important.  The usual reason for doing VM is to isolate images from each other
- and if you don't cover that last 1%, a programming error in one of the images
can nuke your supervisor code into oblivion.  It may be a "VM friendly OS like
Linux", but it can still oops in strange ways. For starters, what happens
if you run a Linux *without* your patches under plex86? ;)
Now if you think about it, and not covering the 1% case is deemed acceptable,
that's OK too.  But it's something that needs to be considered.
