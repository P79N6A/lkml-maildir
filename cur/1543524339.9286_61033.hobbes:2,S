Why not use //shm for the path, or //proc/shm so that if the kernel will
ever honour the extra // namespace even no hacks are required to have
the shmfs mounted in every chroot environment? Btw, proc should be
mounted as //proc, too. Using /var/shm is too much educating the user
IMHO. If you have to mount the shmfs by using mount anyway would it not
be possible to extract the directory used by using the information from
the remount_fs() superblock operation?
