You don't need a fix for the status quo, as shown before and below.

Have you ever read /usr/src/linux/block/scsi_ioctl.c?
You should pay particular attention to the verify_command() function.
Quoting Linux 2.6.15.4 (you won't understand this, but that doesn't
matter, the rest of the world knows I can prove my point, unlike you):
        /* And root can do any command.. */
        if (capable(CAP_SYS_RAWIO))
                return 0;
        if (!type) {
                cmd_type[cmd[0]] = CMD_WARNED;
                printk(KERN_WARNING "scsi: unknown opcode 0x%02x\n", cmd[0]);
        }
        /* Otherwise fail it with an "Operation not permitted" */
        return -EPERM;
This is taken from block/scsi_ioctl.c's verify_command(), ll. 204ff.

Yeah right, I'll shut up because some guy with scruffy manners comes
along and tells everybody they were stupid. Dream on.

Which function should I look at?

You want them to do you a favor, so you get to show them the list they
asked for. If you don't, you aren't getting anything. You can stomp your
foot on the ground, cry out loud, shout your frustration from the
rooftops, it isn't going to change the kernel, you know.
