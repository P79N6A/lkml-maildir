I had further forgotten to mention that I have the NVidia 2960 binary
module loaded, and that D. Stimits just posted a message on the
Linux-XFS mailing list about a kernel BUG report also on page_alloc.c:91
on a similar 2.4.19-rc2-xfs CVS snapshot, also with the NVdriver module
loaded.
Kjell Randa noted that an upgrade to version 2960 fixed things for him,
and Kjell Randa added that removing "agpgart" support fixes things. I
have agpgart support for my VIA chipset, and it's possible that this is
clashing with the NVdriver.
I realize that I may have wasted people's time, since the NVidia driver
is closed-source binary-only, and my system is tainted. I apologize for
this but hope that my messages will at least help some other people who
may run into this problem and will search the archives.
I am upgrading to 2.4.19-rc3-xfs now, and will remove agpgart support
from the kernel. I am keeping my fingers crossed.
