I think you're rushing to judgement on something you've never tried. 
It fundamentally changes coding style; you'd have to try it on some 
mid-size project for at least a few months or longer to get into the
mindset.  To make it all work, you also have to do other things, like 
avoid mallocs and allocing on stack, which forces major changes of 
style (because of the lifetime of things on stack). If you don't change 
style to go with it, then you'll just end up in debug hell, in which
case you'd be right: it would be a (very) bad idea.
(Disclaimer: I've moved away from C++ because of all the other
opportunities for misuse that it offers and encourages.)
