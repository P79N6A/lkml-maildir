You can't strace a process you don't own. And you might not be able
to access the directory below which the file is.
But there is no such access control on "dmesg". So if there is an
access error you leak the potentially protected information in 
the file name

That would still be an information leak for other errors.
Logging the path would be only safe if you determine that the
file and all its parent directories were world read (and accessable)able,
but that would be probably difficult.
