I applied it, it just keeps mainstream files from including old hfs* files
in include/linux, but the old files stay around (you end with two
versions of hfs_fs.h, one in include/linux and other in fs/hfs...)
I did not move anything, just deleted those old files. But as other
filesystems put their xxxx_fs.h in include/linux, I thought that
perhaps hfs(plus) should do the same.
