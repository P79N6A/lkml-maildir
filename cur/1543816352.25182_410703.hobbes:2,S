No, that wont work since #2 and #4 are basically the same TLV. [Recall
that "T" is used to index an array]. Your other alternative is to have
#4 perhaps called TASKSTATS_TGID_STATS and #2 TASKSTATS_PID_STATS
although that would smell a little.
Dont be afraid to do the nest, it will be a little painful initially but
i am sure once you figure it out you will appreciate it.
cheers,
