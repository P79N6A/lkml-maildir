This comes up occasionally.  Is very simple:
asmlinkage ssize_t sys_write(unsigned int fd, const char __user * buf, size_t count)
{
	struct file *file;
	ssize_t ret = -EBADF;
	int fput_needed;
	file = fget_light(fd, &fput_needed);
	if (file) {
		loff_t pos = file_pos_read(file);
		ret = vfs_write(file, buf, count, &pos);
		file_pos_write(file, pos);
		fput_light(file, fput_needed);
	}
	return ret;
}
we can have multiple threads in vfs_write() using the same `pos'.
Locking for file.f_pos is generally file->f_dentry->d_inode->i_mutex.  We
could use that if we were to restructure the code a lot.  Or we could add a
new lock to `struct file'.
Or we could do nothing, because a) the application is going to produce
inderterminate output anyway and b) because it only affects silly testcases
and not real-world apps.
OK, there _might_ be a real-world case: threads appending logging
information to a flat file.  Trivially workable-around with a userspace
lock, or by switching to stdio (same thing).
Yes, really we should fix it.  But it's not worth adding more overhead to
do so.  So the fix would involve widespread (but simple) change, to draw
that f_pos update inside i_mutex.
(We could pseudo-fix it by updating f_pos _before_ entering vfs_write(), too).
