We are now moving to 2.4.x for our latest project and need the 1Gbit support
for the Intel NIC.
The driver on the Intel site works OK with 2.3.13'ish kernels but not with
2.4.x .
I recall reading something regarding the new 2.4 which changed the module
architecture.
The source did not recompile without many errors. Hate to port it if already
done...
Anyone care to send a pointer to the ported source?? -OR- e1000.o ??
TIA -- Mike...
