The filesystem at /var/tmp was xfs. And yes it was repeatable after a
reboot...
So I ran xfs_check on that partition and it reported errors. Then I ran
xfs_repair and after that rebooted, but the problem was still there.
Finally I switched the partition back to ext3, because it got too scary.
But the oops is now repeatable even on this new ext3 partition.
There are no errors in the smartd log. I will run "smartctl -t long" now
and will report back if it finds any errors.
