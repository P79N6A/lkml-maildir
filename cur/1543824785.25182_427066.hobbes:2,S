Maybe, if we were talking about squeezing the last 5%. But all 
applications should be required to greatly complicate their IO routines 
for the last 30%? To reimplement something the kernel already does (at 
least to some degree), as opposed to making the kernel implementation 
better? "Is that dumb, or what?" :-)

that's properly the responsibility of the OS and creating a maintenance 
and portability nightmare.
