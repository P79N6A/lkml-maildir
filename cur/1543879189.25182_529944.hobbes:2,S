GIT v1.5.1.1 Release Notes
==========================
Fixes since v1.5.1
------------------
* Documentation updates
  - The --left-right option of rev-list and friends is documented.
  - The documentation for cvsimport has been majorly improved.
  - "git-show-ref --exclude-existing" was documented.
* Bugfixes
  - The implementation of -p option in "git cvsexportcommit" had
    the meaning of -C (context reduction) option wrong, and
    loosened the context requirements when it was told to be
    strict.
  - "git cvsserver" did not behave like the real cvsserver when
    client side removed a file from the working tree without
    doing anything else on the path.  In such a case, it should
    restore it from the checked out revision.
  - "git fsck" issued an alarming error message on detached
    HEAD.  It is not an error since at least 1.5.0.
  - "git send-email" produced of References header of unbounded length;
    fixed this with line-folding.
  - "git archive" to download from remote site should not
    require you to be in a git repository, but it incorrectly
    did.
  - "git apply" ignored -p<n> for "diff --git" formatted
    patches.
  - "git rerere" recorded a conflict that had one side empty
    (the other side adds) incorrectly; this made merging in the
    other direction fail to use previously recorded resolution.
  - t4200 test was broken where "wc -l" pads its output with
    spaces.
  - "git branch -m old new" to rename branch did not work
    without a configuration file in ".git/config".
  - The sample hook for notification e-mail was misnamed.
  - gitweb did not show type-changing patch correctly in the
    blobdiff view.
  - git-svn did not error out with incorrect command line options.
  - git-svn fell into an infinite loop when insanely long commit
    message was found.
  - git-svn dcommit and rebase was confused by patches that were
    merged from another branch that is managed by git-svn.
