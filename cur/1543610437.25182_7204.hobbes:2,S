Successfully tested on mipsel without modifications to my code.
Two drivers required non-standard versions for the correct operation
of 2.4.14-oss.sgi.com on diskless serial console DecStation 5000/200.
Aside from that, nothing of the rest of the kernel, nor any of my code
was altered. Driver issues should bear no relation to bootmem.
Specifically, the 2.4.5-oss.sgi.com dz.c and a PMAD-AA-capable DEC
Lance driver (PMAD-AA driver thanks to Dave Airlie) were needed. Further
pursuit of those issues should and will be directed to arch maintainers.
Cheers,
Bill
