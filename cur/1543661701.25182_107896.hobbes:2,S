You've not tried this with a tree that has source control (either CVS, BK
or RCS) have you? It looks like it corrupts the SCM too.
I don't really mind getting scripts occasionally to do things, but they 
had better be "obviously fool-proof" for it to really be worth-while. 
Mostly it's easier to just get a diff, even if in this case the (broken) 
script is just 3 lines, and the diff would likely be 700+ lines.
