I don't have any secret receipes, but I was thinking of re-organizing
the code a little. Complexity is due to "confused" case and 
"blocksize < pagesize" cases + going in-and-out of the worker routine
with stored state.
I am thinking of having a "fast path" which doesn't deal with any
of those and "slow" path to deal with all that non-sense.
Something like ..
mpage_readpages()
{
	if (block-size < page-size)
		slow_path;
	while (nr-pages) {
		if (get_block(bh)) 
			slow_path;
		if (uptodate(bh))
			slow_path;
		while (bh.b_size) {
			if (not contig)
				submit bio();
			add all the pages we can to bio();
			bh.b_size -= size-of-pages-added;
			nr_pages -= count-of-pages-added;
		}
	}
}
slow_path is going to be slow & ugly. How important is to handle
1k, 2k filesystems efficiently ? Should I try ?
	
Thanks,
Badari
