It could be done but ... we are moving more and more to generic kernels
(e.g. see the alternative patch code which is enabled unconditionally)
So that when you have a kernel it will boot on near all modern CPUs.
Currently Athlon and P4 kernels run on each other for example.
I would hate to break this again just to save a few hundred bytes in 
this function. Also the overhead is very low so it is also not 
interesting to make it conditional for speed reasons.

In that case they can just profile the kernel. is_prefetch should
show it then.
Of course someone can still add the counter if they want, I'm not
opposed to it.
