There already exists a "pci=rom" switch which tells the PCI core to assign
addresses to the ROM BAR's as well. Either we can offer the files in the sysfs
only if this switch is enabled, or we can create another switch for making
copies of the ROM's during system boot.
Anyway, the devices sharing ROM decoder with another BAR seem to be pretty
rare.
				Have a nice fortnight
