Hardware reset and stomping all over the drive.
Force jam the do_request caller to fail with error_buffer.
All drives have to honor polling or they fail POST on x86.
nIEN is used to signal the HBA to pass the drive interrupt to the host
cpu, other wise delivery does not happen period.
Assume nothing about PIO, because the drive will default to normal state
and the HBA will magically match.
Sleep is not suspend, and these two are confused many times.
Flush, who cares you disable write cache upon entry after the rest.
