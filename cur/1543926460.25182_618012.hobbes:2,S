On irq 20, there's an UHCI, on irq 19 is an EHCI. For every interrupt on 20
there's a spurious interrupt on 19. USB devices on bus of the controller on 20
work. So I know all interrupts are seen. ERR does not increase. Interrupts
for devices on the bus of the controller on 19 arrive at 19 only.
As far as I can determine there are really interrupts on both CPUs on
different vectors for one physical interrupt request.
