Effectively open does the same wrt keeping file alive. So?

Umhm. Wonderful. So open(2) is permitted only if we can modify the
attributes of file? I don't think so. And that provides the same thing -
you can use /proc/<pid>/fd/<fd> as a link.

Or people with insecure suid programs can call truncate() before unlink().
Problem solved.

Aegis - maybe. Linux in general? IMNSHO it seriously breaks normal UNIX
semantics. If it remains CODA deficiency - fine, but if you want to make
this behaviour standard on normal filesystems... No, thanks. And I
suspect that you'll hear the same from *BSD folks.
