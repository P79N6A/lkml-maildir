I get same kind of problem when upgrading from 2.4.2 to 2.4.3 and using
busybox as init/getty 
The problem was a bug in busybox. The console initialisation code was
not correct.

So this this probably a sulogin/mingetty problem. They should set the
CREAD flag in your tty c_cflag.
the patch for busybox repalced the line
	tty.c_cflag |= HUPCL|CLOCAL
by
	tty.c_cflag |= CREAD|HUPCL|CLOCAL
	
Hope this help.
