  Worst case would be reading two blocks which are on the "reference block
boundary" - one block referenced as last one in the block so for next one we
have to read in reference block which would mean seek - read block - seek -
read data block instead of current read block - read data block. But this is
not very probable case so the worst reasonable case would be linear reading
(long at least a few MB) of file large enough in the part where are triple
indirects...  But as we are going to loose only each 256KB when using 1KB
blocks I don't think we will loose more than a few percents (my personal
estimation is <5%).
