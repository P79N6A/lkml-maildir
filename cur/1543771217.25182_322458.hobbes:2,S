tuner-core.c, tuner.h:
        - tuner-core changed to support multiple I2C devices used on
some adapters;
        - Kconfig now has an option (CONFIG_TUNER_MULTI_I2C) to enable
this new behavor;
        - By default, even enabling CONFIG_TUNER_MULTI_I2C, tuner-core
emulates the old behavor,  using first I2C device for both FM and TV;
        - There is a new i2c command (TUNER_SET_ADDR) to allow tuner
clients to select I2C address for FM or TV tuner;
        - Tuner I2C dettach now generates a warning on syslog if failed.
tuner-simple.c:
        - TVision TVF-8531MF and TVF-5533 MF tuner included. It uses, by
default, I2C on 0xC2 address for TV and on 0xC0 for Radio. Both TV and
FM Radio mode are working.
