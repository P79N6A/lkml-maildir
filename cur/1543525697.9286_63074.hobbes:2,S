That's exactly it.  SCSI isn't *that* simple a protocol, so SCSI drives need 
to have a fair amount of intelligence onboard; the incremental improvement 
for fancier schemes such as STP is minimal.

Markup.  SCSI has never been popular enough to get serious volume-based 
price reductions; and those who *do* want it are willing to pay the markup.  
But then, that's what the drive manufacturers would like to see, given the 
nonexistent margins on (E)IDE.  Make it "sexy" enough that it sells better 
than SCSI, without making it so much of a commodity that margins fall 
through the floor.

    We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
