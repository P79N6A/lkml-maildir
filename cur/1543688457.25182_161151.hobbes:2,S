If it's not Alexey himself, I'm sure he knows who is :-)

Ah, a misunderstanding. You meant "can be used to kill 'recursive'
tasklets" (with "recursive" = re-schedules itself). Apparently,
Alexey understood "can be used from a tasklet".
The latter would basically mean to busy loop for the other tasklet
to be scheduled, run, and complete. Not nice.
