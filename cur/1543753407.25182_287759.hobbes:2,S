Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The case statment which describes which mask and set of codes to use for
the Avermedia 771 digital tuner card ir-remote control are commented
out. Perhaps it was assumed this would be the same as the 761 but was
commented out as it was untested? Removing the comment makes my remote
work perfectly. Not sure who maintains this file, Patch below.
