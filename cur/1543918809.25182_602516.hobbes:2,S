please resend the base patch to Andrew (or better yet, a combo patch 
that Andrew can apply and which just does it all).
We've agreed on the external API and that is what matters for now. The 
internal interfacing between the scheduler and cpusets can/could be 
improved later on - and your original patch is reasonable to begin with. 
So lets just move on and do this.
