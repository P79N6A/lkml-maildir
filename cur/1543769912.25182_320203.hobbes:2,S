Are you using hdparm -k1 to keep your settings over a reset?  If you're 
not, then this behaviour is really by-design.

Well, not sure what's wrong here, but ATAPI errors shouldn't normally
result in stopping DMA. We may want to just blacklist your drive rather
than having this stupid fallback. In this case, I suspect it's
CSS/region issue with a DVD.
