Thanks for this information.

Yes, I had missed this when I quickly looked at the web page using lynx. 
Thanks.
One obvious thing that's missing in your performance and Roberto's figures 
is what *exactly* are the non-matching rules.  Ie. do they only match IP 
address, a TCP port, or what? (TCP port matching is about a degree of 
complexity more expensive with iptables, I recall.)
