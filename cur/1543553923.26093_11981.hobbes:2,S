pdev->driver_data is only there as a convenience, there is no rule about
one device per board.
In the case of multiple net devices per board, pdev->driver_data would
point to a structure which you allocate, which contains pointers to each
of that board's net devices.

What questions do you have?
Documentation/pci.txt, include/linux/pci.h, drivers/pci/pci.c, and
various PCI drivers are the only documentation available.
