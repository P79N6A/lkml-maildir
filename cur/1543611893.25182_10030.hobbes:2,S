Your PCI bus is most probably running at 33 Mhz. As it is intended to 
run at this speed. There's nothing wrong with that. The :
"ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with 
idebus=xx"
message is a warning that the PCI bus speed cannot be reliably detected.
For IDE PIO transfer modes the PCI bus speed is a reference which is 
used by timers which regulate IO transfers. As some computers run the 
PCI bus at other frequencies, mainly 25 and 30 MHz instead of 33 MHz 
(for example: old ones with Pentium 75 (25MHz), 90, 120, 150 (30MHz)), 
the idebus parameter is there to allow the timings to be fine-tuned for 
these machines. Nothing to worry about.
