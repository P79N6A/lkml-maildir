Oh, that's true. And that's pretty clearly a bug, since it just means that 
__raw_writel() can't even work in general.

I wonder if we could just remove the TOKEN/ADDR games. I think they were 
done entirely as a debugging aid (but I could be wrong). In particular, 
the compile-time type safefy should hopefully be better at finding these 
things in the long run, and in the short run the TOKEN games have 
obviously played their part.
I wasn't using pp64 back when, maybe there's some other reason for playing
games with the tokens? Who's the guity/knowledgeable party? Ben?
