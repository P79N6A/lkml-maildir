gcc happens to be one of the best memory testers known to man -- much
better than most other programs.  A big reason for that is that it
accesses lots of memory in funny patterns, *AND* accesses to it are
likely to be fatal.
It is just the way it is.  gcc doing the signal 11 is HIGHLY
correlated with the hardware you are running on, which means it's
*usually* hardware-related.

Most likely is that your *hardware* had a bug and the new kernel a
workaround (this is quite common), but without more detail it is very
hard to know.
