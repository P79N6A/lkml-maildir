Either I'm misunderstanding, or this is bogus.
when *pkt is allocated by the various child functions (e.g. 
ieee80211softmac_disassoc_deauth), it is always checked for NULL before 
being used.
Finally, line 453 does another NULL check, so that any failures 
generated above are handled appropriately.
What is the report trying to say?
