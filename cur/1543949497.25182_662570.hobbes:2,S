I liked to do it like that at first, but I faced two problems:
SElinux (As you already know ;)) does the security setup of the initial 
task before calling register_security. Would it be safe to do this
setup after registeration ?
Same case occurs for Smack, it does some locking initializations and
setup initial task's security before registration.
Personally, I feel that it's nicer to let the LSM know if it's
OK to initialize itself before hitting _the point of no return_ (registration).
Anyway, I have no problem to implement it using *status if my 
concerns are wrong.

You'll find above three points fixed the next send. Thank you.
