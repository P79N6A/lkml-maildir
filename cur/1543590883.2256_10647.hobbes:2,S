The nvidia driver has been fine for me up to 2.4.2-ac20. I am going to
update to 2.4.4-ac8 today. In regards to the module the source code is
available from nvidia for inspection. The library that they want you to
use with it is binary only. The library should be source code as well but
the powers that be have said otherwise.
I will keep tabs on the release for kernel oops as well. I am using XFree
4.0.3 with NVIDIA-0.9-769
