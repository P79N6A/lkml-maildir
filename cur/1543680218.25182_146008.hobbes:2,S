Hi!
There are few must-fix bugs in cursor handling:
echo -e '\33[?8c'
...should turn block cursor on on current console. It does so, but if
you switch to another console, block cursor appears there too, and/or
it reverts to line cursor on original console.
echo -e "\33[?18;0;136c" 
...should turn on softcursor (see
Documentation/VGA-softcursor.txt). It does turn it on, but it fails to
erase it once cursor moves! [Type foo in bash, then press backspace
three times].
Play with gpm selection for a while and your cursor gets corrupted
with random dots. Ouch.
