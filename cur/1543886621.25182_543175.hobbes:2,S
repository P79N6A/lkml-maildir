Ah, it's a mis-understanding on what kobj_probe_t function is suppose
to return on success.  When we open loop device that has not been
initialized, we probe it via:
do_open
  get_gendisk
    kobj_lookup
      loop_probe
Notice that in kobj_lookup(), when p->probe() returns non-zero value
(I presume it is an -ERRNO), it breaks out of the loop and propagate
the return value, otherwise, loops back to the beginning of the for
loop and retry, and in there get_disk() will be called via p->lock()
to get a ref against the module.
kobj_look_up(...) {
retry:
        mutex_lock(domain->lock);
        for (p = domain->probes[MAJOR(dev) % 255]; p; p = p->next) {
        ...
        if (kobj)
                return kobj;
        goto retry;
}
So loop_probe() mistakenly returned wrong status and leads to future
oops on inconsistent module ref count.  The following patch fixes the
issue.
