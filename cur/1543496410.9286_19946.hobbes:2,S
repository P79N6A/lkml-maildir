Hi everyone,
I'm new to this list so please forgive me if this question has been asked
before.
I got hold of a patch by a fellow named Dick Johnson (or Johnston?) that
supposedly speeds up TCP/IP transfers by using a piped checksum routine.
It seems to speed things up quite a bit on my system (Slackware
distribution, Kernel version 2.0.35, P233 MMX, 3COM EL3, etc.)
Could anybody tell me when this patch will be included in the "official" 
kernel release? I'm told that this patch has been floating around for a
while but it never seems to make it to the released kernel.
Thanks in advance for your help.
