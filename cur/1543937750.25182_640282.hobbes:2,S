They must have had code paths where they didn't know if IRQs were
enabled or not already, so they tried to create something which
approximates the:
	local_irq_save(flags);
	local_irq_restore(flags);
constructs we have for CPU interrupts, so they could go:
	e1000_irq_disable();
	/* ... */
	e1000_irq_enable();
and this would work even if the caller was running
with e1000 interrupts disabled already.
Or, something like that... it is indeed confusing.
Anyways, yes it's totally bogus and should be removed.
