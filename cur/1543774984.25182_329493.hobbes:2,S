Not necessarily. The registers are just a way to communicate with the
EC. For example on the amd8111 chipset, the SMBus is accessed through
the EC, and it takes several writes and reads to initiate an SMBus
transaction.
Similarly here, reading the accelerometer may take more than just
reading the register values.

Unlikely, I believe it's byte addressed. But there may be address and
data registers among those, for accessing specific functionality.

Quite possibly.

It really depends on how IBM implemented it.
