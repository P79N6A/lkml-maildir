Thanks, but that code only seems to do high-speed serial stuff, and
it doesn't support the IT8703-F chip I wanted to experiment with.
I was eventually (had to use Explorer, yuck) able to download some
specs from ITE's web site.
(I want to hack the ftape driver to use the high-speed "tape"
FDC mode supported by at least some Super I/O chips.)
