Actually, in the single threaded case, the state did not change.  We just didn't 
actually check the state before returning from select().

Actually, there wasn't.  The data was corrupt, therefore there was no data. 
Nothing changed with time, as the corrupt data was already present before we 
returned from select().

POSIX says that if select() says a socket is readable, a read call will not 
block.  Obviously, we are not POSIX compliant.
There's nothing wrong with not being compliant, but it should be documented and 
we shouldn't claim to be compliant.
