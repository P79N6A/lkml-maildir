 or an nfs-mounted partition.
 the suggestion in that case that i received by one of the hotplug
 developers / people-monitoring-debian-bugs-for-hotplug was that you
 should modify the /etc/hotplug scripts to use /devfs/shm/tmp instead,
 assuming that you have a debian initrd.
 now, on SE/Linux that isn't possible, and the reason isn't entirely
 clear, but i believe that the access permissions to the tmpfs
 created by the debian initrd are such that when the umount tmpfs
 occurs, it actually _does_ unmount it.
 on a standard debian/linux system (no selinux kernel) the initrd
 scripts attempt, amongst other things, to mount various filesystems
 and these are successful, but they are not _un_mounted properly later
 on.
 anyway, i digress: the idea i came up with was that the debian
 package be modified such that it's possible to specify the
 state directory, even if that's one of a list of possible
 locations e.g.  choose one: /etc/hotplug, /etc/hotplug/run,
 /var/run/hotplug, /devfs/shm/tmp, other.
 consequently, if this were to be implemented, at least people mad
 enough to use usb disks or nfs mounted stuff, they'd be able to
 at least get going without having to hack the source of hotplug.
