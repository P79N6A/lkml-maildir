Toralf,
It looks like the problem has something to do with VIDEO_TUNER=m while
both TUNER_TEA5761 & TUNER_TEA5767 are set to 'y'.
I thought that we had already seen this issue and fixed it, but I guess
not :-/
One would think that this could be fixed by making TUNER_TEA5761 &
TUNER_TEA5767 both depend on VIDEO_TUNER , but that would be wrong,
since each of those modules can be attached directly to a bridge driver
without tuner.ko being present at all (although this is not done in
practice right now, but it *is* the case with some other tuner drivers)
I'm going to have to think about this for a bit and do some
experimentation.  Thanks for reporting.
Regards,
Mike
