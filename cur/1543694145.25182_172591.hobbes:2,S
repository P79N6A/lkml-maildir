Tried the latest new and shining 2.6.0-test7 on my new and shining
carbonlinux.com Asus M3N. Mostly works Ok,except for a few small
problems. The most annoying is PCMCIA: it does not work.
Here is a snip from dmesg +- few lines:

----------------------------------------------
The same problem was present in 2.6.0-test6. This is debian testing,
vanilla source from kernel.org. ACPI is enabled. Please tell me where to
dig deeper for a problem. Thank you!
                                                                                
2.4.21 hangs keyboard for few second each time ACPI detects that CPU
temperature gets close to 55C trip point, in 2.4.22 keyboard does not 
work in X if Synaptic touchpad is activated. PCMCIA works fine in 2.4.21
and 2.4.22.  pcmcia-cs tools version is  3.2.2-1.3.
P.S. I am not subscribed to the list, but it is not necessary to CC: me
--- I will continue browsing archives.
P.P.S. New xconfig is really cool.
