I am seeing the same kind of deaths on multiple very different SMP boxes
since 2.2 days. They do not die in the "high load" case but only the
high load boxes are unstable. I am having on "testcase" where the box
crashes at least every 24 hours (mutella). Boxes i have seen this
happening on are
Box1:
Dual Celeron 400
IDE Raid 
SCSI System disk
1GB Ram (No Highmem) (Used to have 512M)
EEPro 100
Box2:
Dual PIII 1Ghz
Serverworks Board
1GB Ram (No Highmem)
ICP Vortex Raid
EEPro 100
I have 3 machines of the exakt same type of the latter type. All are
unstable and tend to crash depending on application every 24 hours to
every 2-3 Weeks.
No notice in the syslog, nothing on the serial console. There are
completly dead without any sign before. I have tried to capture
informations about processes, swap, memory etc - Within 1 minute
prior to crash the boxes are basically idle.
