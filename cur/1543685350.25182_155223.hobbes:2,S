It does seem that it's the usblp driver, and I think the way forward is to
collect more information with compiling the driver with debugging to see more

The module author string is "Michael Gee, Pavel Machek, Vojtech Pavlik,
Randy Dunlap, Pete Zaitcev, David Paschal" - who should I CC my results to?
Thanks!
