The patch is  called just before mem_init.  There aren't any pages on freelist yet because mem_init hasn't been called. So I'm not the first thing that ever runs in the boot allocator.  I'm not sure that my answer is addressing your question?
You are, but it's not the answer I want ;-) If you can allocate stuff out
of bootmem that should have been barred by the limiter, I think that's
a bad idea ... you should be restricting earlier, IMHO.
