Uh, what about stuff like this (from tulip.h):
#ifndef USE_IO_OPS
#undef inb
#undef inw
#undef inl
#undef outb
#undef outw
#undef outl
#define inb(addr) readb((void*)(addr))
#define inw(addr) readw((void*)(addr))
#define inl(addr) readl((void*)(addr))
#define outb(val,addr) writeb((val), (void*)(addr))
#define outw(val,addr) writew((val), (void*)(addr))
#define outl(val,addr) writel((val), (void*)(addr))
#endif /* !USE_IO_OPS */
