I wouldn't qualify either of the major VM patch series merged as
rewrites. I saw:
(1) move unmapping function/helpers to different algorithm to save space
(2) NUMA API and support functions
At the risk of trivializing the large amount of work that went into
minimizing the risk of merging these things, the VM hasn't been changed
in any fundamental way by either of them.
