Not to mention how complex it is to get locking right in an efficient
manner. Programming threads is not that much different from kernel SMP
programming, except that in userland you get a core dump and retry, in
the kernel you get an OOPS and an fsck and retry.
For some reason CS professors decided that threads were the cool thing
to do and started teaching all their students to program threadded
applications. Unfortunately they did forget to teach about the caveats
and all the funny side effects that generally mostly threadded apps a
really stupid idea.
It's been like this for some years now, one would expect a switch to
another buzzword of the year paradigm from them soon.
