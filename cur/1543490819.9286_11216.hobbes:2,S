After upgrading to the 2.1.x series some time ago, I have been having
sporatic problems with various PS/2 mice freezing in X after moving from
a virtual terminal to X and back again. The cursor goes to the upper
right hand corner and is extremely erratic when the mouse is moved, if
it moves at all. The only recourse is to reset X, which is not always
possible.
This happens on my machine at home (FIC 503+; 2.2.3) and on my Toshiba
Laptop (Tecra 8000; 2.2.3).
Would this be a PS/2 mouse driver issue, or an XFree86 issue?
Thanks,
jf
