this is not exactly the case here. sleep_on() does preserve interrupt
state. What i'm trying to achieve is to:
  1) catch possibly buggy code that relies on schedule() (not sleep_on)
     preserving irq state. (which it doesnt)
  2) a small performance optimization, sleep_on() could just enable
     interrupts, then some other code that doesnt want to disable
     interrupts can just call schedule() without having any spurious
     __sti() in the way.  eg. __wait_on_page does not want to deal with
     interrupts at all because it can do its test in an atomic way. (i've
     checked some other places too, and there are lots of places which can
     do atomic tests, without disabling interrupts). 
this is pretty much like the schedule_timeout() optimization, to 'offload'
things from the main scheduler, into 'utility' functions, which might (or
might not) do that particular thing.
