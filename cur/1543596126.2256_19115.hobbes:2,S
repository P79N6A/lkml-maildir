It makes perfect sense to me.  Take my family as an example.  My wife 
used Windows because she didn't know anything else existed.  She crashed 
and rebooted quite frequently and never knew there was an alternative. 
 Then she met me and was rather astounded that I hadn't rebooted my 
machine in months.  Now she hates Microsoft because she realizes what 
bullshit she went through.

Well, when you realize that Bill Gates (not MS, just Bill Gates 
personally) has enough money to give every person in the world $10 out 
of his pocket, then you see this argument in a different light.
(Disclaimer:  This statistic was from 2 or 3 years ago.  I don't know 
what the figures are now.)
