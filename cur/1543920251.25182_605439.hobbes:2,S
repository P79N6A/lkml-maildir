Heh. I do agree that you likely find bugs, even if quite often it's 
exactly because the behaviour is something that will never happen on real 
hardware.
But failure testing is very useful - I forget who it was who debugged some 
driver by taking a CD and just scrathing it mercilessly to induce read 
errors ;)
Having a really *bad* HW emulator can certainly work that way too, even if 
it also would probably end up hitting just a few of the potential error 
paths..
