Hi Andrew,
The following patches attempt to convert bunch of drivers to the new
platform device interface so that later we can drop
platform_device_register_simple() interface.
I tried CCing authors or maintainers of the core in question earlier,
these are the ones I did not get any freedback on so they must be
perfect ;)
I wonder if you could add these to -mm for now.
Thanks!
