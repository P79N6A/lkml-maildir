My two cents worth:
I'd show it if it differed in kernel version, otherwise not. If this code is 
all relatively self contained, such as all being within the menuconfig/xconfig 
code, then it won't affect the running of the kernel. And yes, it would mean a 
little more code in place, but we're waiting for keyboard strokes in this 
code, or viewing its output. It's not timing-critical.
Sorry I took so long to get to this, but I've only caught up to this point.
