Ah, our weather is honestly not all that bad. In fact, judging from the 
various sources out there, Seattle actually gets less rainfall overall than 
Portland. (ex. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle,_Washington#Climate
) The 
worst part is the 8-9 months of constantly-overcast and dreary weather in the 
fall, winter, and spring; but, to balance that out, our summers are very, 
very nice. And yes, we even get droughts every so often around here! :)

Yikes! No sun for that long? I couldn't do it. I'd probably go bonkers (or 
even more so...).
