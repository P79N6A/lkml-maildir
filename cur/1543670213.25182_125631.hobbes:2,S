I realize this isn't the problem you're really concerned about, but the
above may happen if you are using a version of the 1394 code off the
linux-2.4 branch prior to the patch I sent to the list Monday that Ben
recently applied.  (You should be able to get around this without
downloading the latest code and recompiling by setting attempt_root=1
when insmodding ohci1394.
