Great, thanks.  Updates to Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt and
Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt would be nice.
If the machine locks up with interrupts enabled we can use sysrq-T and
sysrq-P.  If it locks up with interrupts disabled the NMI watchdog will
automatically produce the same info as your patch.  So what advantage does
the patch add?
