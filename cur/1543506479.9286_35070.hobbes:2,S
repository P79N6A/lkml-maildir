I never saw my original message go through so I apologize if this is a
re-post...
I'm trying to mount an EDSI Xenix partition from Linux. I'm using the
2.2.10 kernel and I'm not having any luck. When the kernel boots it does
recoginze a partition called eda4 but it also gives me a "ps2esdi_out_cmd
timed out while sending command (status=00)." I'm looking at the ps2esdi.c
source and that looks like an ok message but I wanted to be sure.
I can cat the device but when I try and mount it with as a sysv partition
Linux says it doesn't know what the partition is.
So I guess my ultimate question is how well does Linux mount a Xenix EDSI
partition and does anybody have any suggestions as to what I could be
doing wrong? From what I've read this should be a fairly stable area but
the documentation in the kernel is lacking in this area.
Thanks,
Chris

I hope some animal never bores a hole in my head and lays its eggs in my

just eggs hatching.
