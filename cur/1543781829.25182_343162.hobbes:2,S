One important thing I forgot to add is that the symlink must point to a
directory not a file.  If it points to a file all works fine.
I tried stracing nautilus to answer your question.  And this time for
the first time instead of a Bad page state I got a BUG() triggered in
fs/namei.c, the arrow below marks the spot:
void page_put_link(struct dentry *dentry, struct nameidata *nd)
{
	if (!IS_ERR(nd_get_link(nd))) {
		struct page *page;
		page = find_get_page(dentry->d_inode->i_mapping, 0);
		if (!page)
---->			BUG();
		kunmap(page);
		page_cache_release(page);
		page_cache_release(page);
	}
}
Here is the BUG output:

The compressed strace output is attached.  It was tracing the main
nautilus process (strace -f -F -o /strace.log -p 21910) which is where
the bug was hit as well.  FWIW I attached strace to the process just
before double-clicking on the symlink in the nautilus window...
Looking at the bottom of the strace.log file it seems like two possibly
concurrent stat64() calls of the symlink were running, one of which did
not complete...  (note this was done on a dual-cpu machine with
hyperthreading enabled, i.e. it appears to have four cpus).
Does this help?
Let me know if I can provide any other details...  (I can provide an ssh
connection to a machine for testing purposes if required.)
Best regards,
        Anton
