ok, a BIOS error but there is no newer version of this BIOS for my
motherborad and the manufactures would say that it works with windows
(it works really :-) so it have to be a linux error! it could be right
that the BIOS have to handle the calls like 32bit calls but what should
do all the users that have brocken BIOS version ?! I know that linux
have support for such kind of horrible systems why not for brocken
APM-BIOS version ?!
