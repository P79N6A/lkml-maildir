The same applies to dentries/inodes too, doesn't it? But their
scan is already virtual so their LRUs could be just split into
a per container list (but then didn't Christoph L. plan to 
rewrite that code anyways?)
For memory my guess would be that (E) would be easier than (D) for user/file
memory though less efficient.
