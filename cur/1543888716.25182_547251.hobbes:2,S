you were doing fine up until the last point, they are interrelated but
not architecturally dependent, we can do a lot of work on this stuff
without that, we don't need to deprecate anything, just provide new
interfaces that new drivers can use to implement this stuff, then
people can pull over the old drivers at their own pace, like we can
just stick a flag in the console that says we can handle things like
dumping oopsen in KD_GRAPHICS etc.. drivers that can do it will do it,
drivers that can't won't.
You don't compile VT out you just disable it when you have a driver
that supports the model,
You also require a heavy weight state switch for suspend/resume in any
case so this could be utilised for other things, e.g. text mode on
many cards can't be done while acceleration is operational, but
certainly don't want to bar text mode for people who want it..
