More a design principle than a real problem.

Which is valid because the process the current variable is pointing to is
always running on the current CPU, therefore it's implicitly locked and
can't just go away.  Due to the existence of the idle process there is
also a guarantee that current always points to a valid process.  Not much
guarantee of anything else for the current process - it might just be
exiting for example.
