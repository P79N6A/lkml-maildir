Would I be right in thinking that this would be an array with three
possible values for each element...
	FIXED		Block not movable.
	MOVABLE		Block in use and movable.
	UNUSED		Block not in use.
...with the defragmenter basically exchanging MOVABLE and UNUSED blocks
to get the files in an unfragmented state. The FIXED value would handle
things like the superblock, inode blocks and other special uses, and all
other blocks would be either MOVABLE or UNUSED as appropriate.
Another option might be to split MOVABLE into DIRECTORY and FILE values
instead, but whether that would be useful is questionable at best.

As long as it runs on systems without X-windows available rather than
being limited to only run under X... My preference would be for a tool
similar to `make menuconfig` for this sort of utility.
Best wishes from Riley.
