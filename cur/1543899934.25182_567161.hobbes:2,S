I would propose a third method. Some information cannot be extracted
from the vmlinux file, even with debugging information. That is
currently the page size.
So why not adding an option to makedumpfile which specifies the
.config of the kernel? If the .config is available, it can extract the
missing information (page size) from the .config and also use the
kernel version from this file.
If no config is available, the current process is right since using
the version of the running kernel ensures to some degree (not 100 %)
that the page size is correct.
Thanks,
   Bernhard
