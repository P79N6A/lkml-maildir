Hey, Pekka,
A couple of little things I noticed...

Should that text read something like:
	if (condition != DIE_TRAP || !ctx->active)
Presumably you won't be active if something else is going wrong, but one
never knows.

That only checks the first page; if the probed region partially overlaps
another one found later in memory, the registration will succeed.
Maybe you want to decrement kmmio_count if you decide to return -EEXIST
(or hold off on the increment until after the test)?
In general, I worry about what happens if an interrupt handler generates
traced MMIO traffic while a fault handler is active.  It looks a lot
like the "all hell breaks loose" scenario mentioned in the comments.  Is
there some way of preventing that which I missed?  Otherwise, maybe,
should the ioremap() wrappers take an additional argument, being an IRQ
to disable while trace handlers are active?
