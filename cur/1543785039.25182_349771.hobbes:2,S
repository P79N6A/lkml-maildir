-mm3 looks much better, seems to work on ia32 and x86_64 at least.
PPC64 is still broken by the tty cleanup stuff. there were some fixes
going back and forth ... hopefully someone will gather them and push
to you soon, would nice to be testing that again.
drivers/char/hvc_console.c: In function `hvc_poll':
drivers/char/hvc_console.c:600: error: `count' undeclared (first use in this function)
drivers/char/hvc_console.c:600: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
drivers/char/hvc_console.c:600: error: for each function it appears in.)
drivers/char/hvc_console.c:636: error: structure has no member named `flip'
Thanks for everything ... testing just makes one bitter ;-)
