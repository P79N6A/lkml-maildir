It seems heavy in general, but the intersection with mmconfig looks
rather limited:
- s/acpi_table_mcfg_config/acpi_mcfg_allocation/
- s/base_address/address/
- s/pci_segment_group_number/pci_segment/
- address is now 64 bits
The last point is both good and bad.  The i965 needs it (good), I
don't know if the mapping functions can handle actual 64bits addresses
(maybe bad), especially on i386.
  OG.
