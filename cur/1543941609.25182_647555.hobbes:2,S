Yeah, I re-ran some statistics the other day on our kernel development
rate, and changed my formula after Andrew accused me of severely
undercounting the rate of change.
Turns out that as of 2.6.24-rc8 for the 2.6.24 kernel release we did:
	lines added per day:	4945
	lines removed per day:	2006
	lines modified per day:	1702
And note, that is real stuff, not renames or file moves at all, git
handles not reporting that.
That's for the 99 days that it took to do 2.6.24-rc8 (I need to re-run
the scripts now that 2.6.24 is out.)
It's fricken scarily amazing that things are still working at all...
Just something to make you all sleep well at night :)
thanks,
