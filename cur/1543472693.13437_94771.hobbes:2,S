There is code out there that assumes fsync() flushes all the
meta-data too (I think this is a FFS/BSDism more than anything).
To the best of my knowledge, nothing requires meta-data to be flush
upon fsync, and it isn't -- applications wanting this behavior will
have to do other things to ensure this.
