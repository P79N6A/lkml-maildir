We are supposed to blame Liberate TVMail 2.6 for all the bad
practices of Hell.Surfers.  It isn't his fault he uses a
product that breaks threads, replies by attachment nor the
fact that he doesn't press the carriage return (enter key).
After all this way he can read his email on TV while reclining on
plush cushions.
</sarcasm>
Actually i had no trouble telling that it was Alan he quoted.
If you turn off header filtering you will see that the
complete mail header (including delivery routing info) is
included in the attachment.
