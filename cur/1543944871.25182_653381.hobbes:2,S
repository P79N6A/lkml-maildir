ext3/jbd and ext4/jbd2 patches usually find their way into the tree
via different routes, so bundling these two fixes was inappropriate.
General guidelines: one patch per subsystem and one patch per concept.
Sometimes those guidelines get bent, but only occasionally.  Usually
to avoid the silliness of handling a huge stream of one-line patches.
