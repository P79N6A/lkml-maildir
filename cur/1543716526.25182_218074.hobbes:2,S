OK, will do.

Thanks, I have passed the call to get involved on to a group of Linux 
consumer electronics developers (the Consumer Electronics Linux Forum; 
Tim Bird will hold a BoF at OLS introducing this group).  I am involved 
at an infrastructure level and have helped steer various general 
requirements toward use of LDM (which we've been using even in 2.4 for 
some time) and hotplug (which is new to us for these purposes and they 
might not yet have much experience with this), and can also serve as a 
conduit for feedback.  I appreciate your interest in the needs of 
embedded developers and hope that we can contribute some useful 
suggestions and features.
