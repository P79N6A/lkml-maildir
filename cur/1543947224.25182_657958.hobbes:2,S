Making 0xf0000 bus addresses RAM is probably a bad idea anyway. Most OS's
treat the E820 map with paranoia because we do see real PCs which
variously claim that the BIOS ROM space is RAM, ACPI, Reserved or just
forget to mention it. At least for a non PV guest it should be mapped as
R/O.
Likewise you get E820 maps with zero size entries, repeated entries ...
