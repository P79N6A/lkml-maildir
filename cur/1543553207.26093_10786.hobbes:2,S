Broadcast determines the type of connection - broadcast or point-to-point
(there can be other types also, but you will not see them much).
You wouldn't want to do this anyway.  It means Ethernet broadcasts, not IP
broadcasts.  IP will not work over Ethernet without broadcasts.

Do you really need rwhod at all?
If rwhod doesn't have an option as to which address to bind to, your only
choice is to block its communication with ipchains.
