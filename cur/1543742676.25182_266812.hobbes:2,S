free_irq only masks the interrupt line when the last user is
freeing that IRQ line.

The calls look fine (providing you arent using "dev" as the cookie for
multiple "request_irq" functions on the same IRQ at the same time)

It depends at runtime on the system, how the IRQ assignment is done and
sometimes on hardware "features". The official kernel internal policy is
that
a) "irq" is a cookie obtained for PCI devices by pdev->irq 
b) you pass the cookie to request_irq
c) it has no other guaranteed meaning at all
once you get off x86 this gets even more important.
