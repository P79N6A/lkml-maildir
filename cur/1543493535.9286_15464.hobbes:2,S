Binding an "ethernet card to a CPU" sounds complicated. But if you think
about binding an IRQ to a specified CPU it will be more clear.
If there is any sense to do this binding it can be implemented by binding
IRQ of the ethernet card to a CPU. This feature may be usefull for other
purposes as well. But has Linux got such a mechanism like IRQ-CPU bindings ?
