Damn! I'm doing this from out of town and my pine setup had a reply to to
another email account, and I didn't read this before I sent my previous
response (so Please ignore it!)

I'm only working on your PREEMPT_RT extension, so I wasn't thinking about
the mainline kernel.
But I'll ask again from this context. What is the plan for softirqs on the
PREEMPT_RT kernel? Are you going to thread them? Otherwise, what other way
can you preempt different softirqs?
I understand that the design of softirqs will not change for the mainline
kernel, but what changes are going to be made wrt PREEMPT_RT? If they are
going to be threaded, then grouping them would not be too much of a
problem with simple #ifdefs around the code and keep the mainline
untouched.
I may be just confused, so please enlighten me :-)
Thanks,
