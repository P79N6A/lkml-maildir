A while ago I worked on a new acpi daemon that could receive events from 
both netlink and /dev/input devices. Right now it's more like a testing 
tool then a real replacement for the current acpid. I haven't had time 
to work on it.

$ git clone git://dbservice.com/acpid
You'll need dbus and lua to compile it. There's also a readme that 
describes how to get it running and how it works. In its default 
configuration it will print the events into stdout.
