the samurai ddr has been around for a while as their ddr-sdram evaluation
platform for vendors...
the original samurai chipset based boards were 100mhz fsb dual boards
for use  with intel pII. they (micron semicondutor) oemed them for server
intergrators about two years ago... they were notable for having 64bit pci
slots at the time...
the board in the picture looks rather unlike the previous samurai ddr 
based board I've seen.
there is an old (dec 99) toms hardware article on the samurai ddr
evaluation baord...
