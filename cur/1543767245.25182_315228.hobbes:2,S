I don't think we need that one.

Makes sense as an ulimit, that way the sysadmin can easily disable the
user mount feature aswell.

Yupp.

noexecis a bit too much, so the above look good.

what filesystem do you think is unsafe?
 - virtual filesystems exporting kernel data are obviously safe as
   they enforce permissions no matter who mounted them.  (actually we'd
   need to check for some odd mount options)
 - block-based filesystems should be safe as long as the mounter has
   access to the underlying block device
 - network/userspace filesystems should be fine aswell
