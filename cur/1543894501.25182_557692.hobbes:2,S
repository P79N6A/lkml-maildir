They don't add any restrictions that don't already exist. As stated in section 
0 of the GPLv2 the scope of the license is "copying, distributing and 
modification".

Still the same one that Linus pointed out. No amount of faulty logic can 
change that.

Huh? They have complied with the terms - and, IMHO, the spirit - of the 
license under which that software was released.

If they are *CONTRIBUTING* then they are not just simple users anymore.

And failing. You say that the intent and spirit of the GPLv2 is clear if you 
read it. I read it and I feel its pretty clear that the only things that the 
GPLv2 sought to protect are *EXACTLY* "copying, distribution and 
modification".
