Ummm...  'Actual' or 'Assigned' perhaps?

Yeah...  My main objection is passing around two or three superfluous arguments
in the common case.  Most of the time, the only necessary argument to
sec->capable():
	int (*capable) (struct task_struct *tsk, const struct cred *cred,
			int cap, int audit);
is cap; tsk, cred and audit are all superfluous in the (very) common case.
How about:
	int (*fast_capable) (int cap);
which assumes current, current_cred() and SECURITY_CAP_AUDIT?
Benchmarking is tricky, given that the individual savings will be relatively
small in comparison to the code that calls them.
However, if I can get rid of three arguments passed into each of
security_capable(), selinux_capable() and cap_capable(), that really should
speed things up if you call it enough times, especially as current is held in a
register on some archs.
I'll see what I can do.

Should has_capability() be out of lines and have security_real_capable() merged
into it?  And the same for has_capability_noaudit() and
security_real_capable_noaudit()?

Perhaps a separate patch to optimise capable().  As I said, I'll see about
benchmarking it.
