   Thats why a union filesystem (or some unionfilesystem support in a
   devfs) would be useful: an administrator can set up prototype nodes
   in a regular /dev directory, and when devfs initializes it will
   properly carry the permissions up to the current filesystem (and if
   you change the permissions on modes in the devfs filesystem, those
   permissions will carry down to the base filesystem.  No fuss, no muss,
   no bother, and it gets rid of the thrice-damned magic numbers and
   hidden kernel policy that the current scheme has.)

   david parsons \bi/ without devfs, I can't use 2.3.x kernels.
