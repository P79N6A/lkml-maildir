You missed his point.  He is saying ext3 code should migrate towards
becoming reiser4 plugins, and reiser4 should be merged now so that the
migration can get started.
I don't really care whether ext3 uses our plugin model.  (If it does,
fine, please credit me for it though, and consider maybe a thank you.  I
am happy to thank the XFS team for the idea of delayed allocation....)
I am entitled to get some advantage from being the first on the block. 
Other fs maintainers don't want me to have that entitlement, so they add
delays to slow us down.  It is odd how Hellwig no longer describes
himself as XFS associated.  Did SGI and him

True, but what is interesting is that you don't think the faster
filesystem should be merged, and the others should catch up to it later
if they can, instead you think it should be delayed until all of its
benefits can be transmitted to the other filesystems first so that
everyone can be equal.
