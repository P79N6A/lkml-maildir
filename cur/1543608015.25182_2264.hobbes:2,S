Hello,
We are developping a few kernel modules handling serial ports in order to have a
real time control on professional video systems as VTR, video servers and more
...
I am looking for a way that would allow me to have a kind of core dump instead
of of freezing and rebooting my box when my code is wrong and the module not
working properly...
Thanks to any one who already solved this problem and would share its experience
with me.
Best regards
Matthieu
