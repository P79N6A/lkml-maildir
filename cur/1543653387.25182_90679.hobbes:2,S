This could be an indication that epoll of an epoll fd should not be
allowed.  This kind of sucks as epoll event hierarchies appear, at
least on the surface, very natural, and better than poll()/epoll.
Another option would be to allow a reasonable depth (2? 3?). The extra
checking (depth calculation) only needs to be performed if a file is
added or removed where f_op == epoll_f_op.
