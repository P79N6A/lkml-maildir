   This "fix" breaks a lot of systems with partial PCI slot number decoding
and other nasties.
   The primary problem is that there exists no reliable way how to detect
peer PCI busses since the chipset designers have screwed the peer bridges
completely.
   Please download new alpha version of pciutils from
ftp://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/pub/linux/pci/alpha
 and send me results
of 'lspci -H1 -vvxM', I'll look at it. (It will possibly take a bit longer
for me to analyse it since I'm leaving for a week tomorrow, but I already
think I have some solution.)
				Have a nice fortnight
