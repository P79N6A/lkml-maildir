At least my own code checks for that and fails if there is a mapping 
already placed at the fixed address it needs to use.  If we're paranoid, 
we could BUG() on getting a vma back from the new find_vma_prepare call.

Video drivers, others that require specific alignment (4MB pages for 
example).  Historically, the mmap call has been the hook for doing this, 
hence the comment in do_mmap from davem.  Unless there's a really good 
reason for changing the hook, I don't see doing so as providing much 
benefit other than making source compatibility hard.
