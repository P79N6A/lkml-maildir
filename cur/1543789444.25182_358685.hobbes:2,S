Btw, I'm going to apply your patch in _addition_ to the bigger maxbatch 
value.
It might help latency a bit, but more importantly, on one of my machines 
(but only one - it probably depends on how much memory you have etc), I 
can re-create the out-of-file-descriptors thing even with a maxbatch of a 
million.
Probably what happens is that the rcu callbacks just grow fast enough 
without any quiescent period that the maxbatch thing just never matters: 
we simply run out of file descriptors because we haven't even gotten 
around to trying to free them yet.
I'm compiling with your patch on that machine to verify that it does 
actually help keep the queues down. Just doing a
	while : ; do cat /proc/slabinfo | grep filp; sleep 1; done
while running the test programs gives some alarming numbers as-is.
Your patch keeps the numbers _much_ more stable.
Regardless, keeping track of the number of rcu callback events we have 
will almost inevitably be part of whatever future strategy we take, so 
your patch is definitely a step in the right direction, even if we have to 
tweak it later.
