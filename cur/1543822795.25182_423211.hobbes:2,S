Any longer than this!
in boomerang_start_xmit()
	spin_lock_irqsave(&vp->lock, flags);
	/* Wait for the stall to complete. */
	issue_and_wait(dev, DownStall);
  Pretty big wait!
    [...]
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&vp->lock, flags);
Where we have in issue_and_wait
static void
issue_and_wait(struct net_device *dev, int cmd)
{
 [...]
	/* OK, that didn't work.  Do it the slow way.  One second */
	for (i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
 [...]
}
So this can have interrupts off for over a second!
