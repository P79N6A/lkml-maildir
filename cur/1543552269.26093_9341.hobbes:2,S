The latest version is always available at 
http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/kbuild/
Release 0.8.2: Sun Oct 22 21:52:47 EDT 2000
	* Added -W option to permit undefined symbols in -I files.
	* Miscellaneous typo fixes.
This version is synchronized with 2.4.0-test9.  I believe it is ready
for production use, but not all of the rules file is certified as yet.

Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did, and it never will.
Find out just what people will submit to, and you have found out the exact
amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them; and these will
continue until they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both.
The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they
oppress.
	-- Frederick Douglass, August 4, 1857
