However the KConfig help message as it is currently written is wrong.

I tried to do this, but the Kconfig help message was misleading.  I 
still needed to come here for help.

Andi was wrong.  It appears that he read the first sentence of my email 
and jumped to a conclusion.  The /proc/mtrr output that I included in my 
first post showed the my bios was doing the right thing.  My problem was 
that I was using CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G, which is what the KConfig help 
message told me to do.  After switching to CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G the OS was 
able to map all of my ram.
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:       4016768    3924312      92456          0     360132    3030336

Swap:      5116692       2676    5114016
Thanks to those with the correct advice.  I'm sure I would have got this 
by trying each memory model in turn, but at least now I know what is 
going on.
