I finally got to the bottom of this problem (with Ian Abbotts help). I 
had the wrong usb host module loaded, ubci not usb_uhci (in fact it was 
compiled in to the kernel). The write call to the usbserial device was 
blocking. This seemed to happen when a data packet of more than 8 bytes 
was written.
Having two drivers, one which works sometimes seems to be a bit of an 
elephant trap.
This was an error that occurred when I was preparing the new config 
file. I would guess I left the usb as the default. It might me better to 
have no defaults in the config, that way you are forced to make the 
correct selection.
What is the recommended way of transferring .config files between kernel 
versions? I see there are always a lot of changes. Can you safely just 
copy the existing file and then run xconfig to include any new options?
