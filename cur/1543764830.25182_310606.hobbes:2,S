at that point Chris Mason's "rej" tool is pretty nifty:
  
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/mason/rej/rej-0.13.tar.gz
it gets the trivial rejects right, and is pretty powerful to quickly 
cycle through the nontrivial ones too. It shows the old and new code 
side by side too, etc.
(There is no fully automatic mode in where it would not bother the user 
with the really trivial rejects - but it has an automatic mode where you 
basically have to do nothing - maybe a fully automatic one could be 
added that would resolve low-risk rejects?)
it's really easy to use (but then again i'm a vim user, so i'm biased), 
just try it on a random .rej file you have ("rej -a kernel/sched.c.rej" 
or whatever).
