Subject: [PATCH] /proc/uptime on SMP machines

Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hallo,
I didn't see a maintainer for the /proc filesystem, to I send this mail to
linux-kernel for discussion. 
At present the idle value in /proc/uptime is only the idle time for the first
processor. With 2.4, processes seam "stickier" for my, and e.g "yes
>/dev/null" on an otherwise idle machine can stay for a long time on one
processor of my (intel) SMP machine. That way, the present output of
/proc/uptime can lead to a wrong conclusion.
Appended patch returns the average of all idle processes an all
processors. 
If I don't hear back, I will send to Linus and Alan for inclusion.
Bye
