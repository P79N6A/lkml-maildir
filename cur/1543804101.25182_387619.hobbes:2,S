Existing distros (RHEL3, RHEL4, SLES9, ..) don't have a huge problem
because my target user - the ipmi driver - does its own DMI scanning
on those distros still.  Ugly, but works.  So the only concern is
SLES10 and RHEL5, both of which are still rebasing to upstream best as
I can tell from their publicly posted kernels.  So if it can be done
"right" in 2.6.16-rc, let's do that.  If it will be intrusive, and
after 2.6.16 is out, than a minimally intrusive but working patch for
2.6.16-rc would be preferred.
Thanks!
Matt
