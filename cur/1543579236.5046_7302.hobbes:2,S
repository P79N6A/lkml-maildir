No, bridging is transparent to most drivers, so this doesn't
necessarily make sense.  The thing to do is just decree "drivers will
be registered in *this* order..." and then list the busses in some
arbitrary order, and specify some sub-scheme for enumerating drivers on
each bus.
...Which still doesn't solve the problem of multiple device types on a
single bus, for which I think my proposal (passing a meta-address of
some sort into scsi_register() and similar, and letting it sort devices
as they come in.  (Until the end of the bootstrap, of course.  Modules
all go in at the end.)

There are lots of non-PCI systems out there.  And quite a few, I
suspect, where PCI is bridged off the "native" bus rather than the
other way 'round.
