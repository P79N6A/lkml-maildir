A number of projects do their performance critical things in userspace,
including real-time audio and video editing.  The kernel is *NOT* for
performance-critical things, unless they cannot be done efficiently in
userspace.  It is for _security_critical_ and _stability_critical_  
things,
and even then, some of those are pushed to userspace as well.

There is a good reason to hate change (at least without thorough  
evidence
to back it up).  Even small changes can break things in subtle ways.   
Big
changes can tend to wreak kernel-global (and even userspace-global)  
havoc.

If those files are as special as you lead me to believe, even a simple
"tar -cjvf foo.tar.bz2 foo" would break horribly, because it would  
tar up
all sorts of strange special files that shouldn't be included.  Worse,
when I untar that archive on the filesystem, it will overwrite those  
files,
which probably should be overwritten even less than they should be  
stored
in an archive.

Personally, I know several sysadmins who, never having heard of Reiser4
but using it anyways, would get scared when all of the '...' directories
started showing up, thinking that some cracker had gotten a module  
loaded
in their kernel.  If you can, please avoid overloading existing  
semantics
in filesystems.  You can either claim that your filesystem is POSIXy,
(similar to ext3, xfs, etc), or you can claim that it's not  
compatible by
design (AFS, Coda) or you can claim that it's a completely virtualized
interface (procfs, sysfs, CKRM fs, etc) and doesn't care about POSIX in
any case.  Reiser4 definitely isn't the third, but neither is it  
either of
the first two, because it would break standard operations.

When the VFS work gets done, this discussion can move on, otherwise, we
are stuck at an impasse.

I think the '...' is just a bad idea in general, because it breaks tar
and such.  An interface like this might be simpler to design and use:
# mkdir /attr
# mount -t attrfs attrfs /attr
/attr/fd/$FD_NUM              == '...' directory for a filedescriptor
/attr/fs/$DEV_NUM/$INODE_NUM  == '...' directory for an inode
It would be usable from a shell with a simple "getattrpath" command
which returns "fs/$DEV_NUM/$INODE_NUM" by stat-ing any given path.
Cheers,
