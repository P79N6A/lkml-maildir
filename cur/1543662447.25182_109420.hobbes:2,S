For posterity's sake...I think I found a somewhat suitable work around.
I set up the real-time-clock at 1024hz, open /dev/rtc, and then add it's
file descriptor to my select input set when (0 < timeout < 10).
This causes a near busy-spin on slower cpus...but for me at least that
is the lesser of two evils...
If anyone has any cleaner/better/faster/ hacks they feel like sharing,
do let me know!
PS.  Don't use SCHED_RR with this hack..or you can live-lock your system
if it's like mine :)
Thanks,
Ben
