Every time I try to decipher S_I* combos I cry in pain. Often I just
refer to include/linux/stat.h defines to find out what mode it is
because numbers are actually quickier to understand.
Compare and contrast:
	0644 vs S_IRUGO|S_IWUSR vs rw_r__r__
I'd say #2 really sucks.
Another rationale: "ls -l" is used pretty often and people are used to
its output so new defines would be very easy to understand.
Target usage sysfs attributes modes and similar stuff. Driver authors
would just write
	.attr = {.name = "state", .mode = r__r__r__ },
and be done with it.
I'm not sure you want to see
	if (mode & _w__w__w_)
somewhere in generic code, this is debatable, so I'll go with attribute
stuff first.
What people think? Should folks at Moscow call 03 ASAP?
