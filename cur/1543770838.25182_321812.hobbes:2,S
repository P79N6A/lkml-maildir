Sucky web site without proper info ... hmm ... any chances you can point
me to the website for PREEMPT_RT, surely the professional design of it
and the included documentation will make me want to adopt it right away
... what's that you say, there's no website ...

:) seriously, though, I can't believe we've discouraged you because
we're very poor at website design. Surely after all that's been said
about the nanokernel approach you'd want to at least dedicate some
short amount of time for downloading the code and at least running
a diffstat on it or something ... or even better, giving it a test
ride. Philippe has even gone as far as providing patches providing
both PREEMPT_RT and Adeos under the same roof ... it doesn't get
much better than that ...
