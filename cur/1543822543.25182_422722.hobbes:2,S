Why is wc_fifo volatile?  The only places you actually use it, you
seem to cast away the volatile anyway.
Also, again, no typedef of structures please.

Why do you need this wrapper?  Why not just call __iowrite64_copy()
without the obfuscation?  Anyone reading the code will just have to
search back to this define and mentally translate the size back and
forth all the time.

This looks like something that should be fixed up in the general PCI
quirk handling rather than in every driver...

Similarly looks like generic PCI code (if it's needed at all).  If I
understand correctly you're trying to check if MSI has a chance at
working on the system, but a network device driver has no business
walking up the PCI hierarchy.

ALIGN() from <linux/kernel.h>?
