Out of curiosity, that was SuSE not mainline ?

True, initialization of "zone" variable in nr_free_buffer_pages() is 
un-nice.

Do we really want to limit dirty cache to low mem on HIGHIO capable 
machines? I'm afraid doing so might hurt performance on such systems.
I think it might be wise to have nr_free_buffer_pages() take highmem
into account if CONFIG_HIGHIO is set ?
