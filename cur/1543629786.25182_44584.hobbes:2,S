   #define pte_pfn(x) (pte_val(x) >> PAGE_SHIFT)

   Yes.

   #define pfn_pte(pfn,prot) mk_pte_phys(pfn << PAGE_SHIFT, prot)
   but you should better replace mk_pte_phys completely.
All of this is ignoring the fact that phys_base has to be subtracted
from any physical address before applying as an index to mem_map on
sparc64.
I have the correct fixes for sparc64 in my tree and I'll merge it
all to Linus.
