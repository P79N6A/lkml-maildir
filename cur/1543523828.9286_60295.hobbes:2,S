No, 8 is option length. This old strace does not show SO_LINGER option.

It means that it set linger to longer time.

What is this pnserver? I suspect it sets linger to 0, which is illegal
from all the viewpoints. From viewpoint of 2.2 it is infinite linger,
from viewpoint of BSD and 2.3 it is immediate socket destruction.
It is interesting compatibility question, try to get newer strace,
probably it is better. Well, or check this with gdb. Or get my strace
from ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing.

Nothing will break. Programs using SO_LINGER correctly just do not exist
in the nature. It is fully dead option.
