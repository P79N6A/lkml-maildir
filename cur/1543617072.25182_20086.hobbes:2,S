I've seen apt-get used successfully by people whom I wouldnt trust to have
a glass front door in case they forgot to open it. The trick being that
"upgrade" is a desktop item someone put there that runs apt for them (or
gnome-apt or kpackage)
Now to do everything you describe does not need her to configure a custom
kernel tree. Not one bit. You think apt or up2date build each user a custom
kernel tree ?
You basically build everything modular as the distro kernel did, you install
it as the distro kernel would. You build an initrd as the distro kernel did.
Not only does it work, but it needs no configuration because when the box
was installed someone already configured it
