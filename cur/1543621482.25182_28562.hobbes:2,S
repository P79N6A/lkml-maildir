You are not serious? Aren't you? 'Bit of paranoia there?
Can't you just imagine somebody who did get out of the coding business in
professional terms but stills to enjoys hacking from time to time?
If you are impressed by my speed, and can't imagine that what I'm doing

I know a bit about mailing systems as well ;-). And I would care to be
