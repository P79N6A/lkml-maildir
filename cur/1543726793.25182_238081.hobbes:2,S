I find this to be very useful. I always found the "sleep for a while 
until the device we want appears" approach very cumbersome.
However, after looking at your patch, it seems that having a 
get_blkdevs() function that alloc's an array of strings, and return it 
to a function that only compares the strings against the name it is 
looking for and drops the array altogether, is a little overkill.
Why not have a simple blkdev_exists(char *name) function in genhd.c, 
call it directly, and drop the match_root_name() function completely?
Maybe I'm missing something, but it seems much simpler...
