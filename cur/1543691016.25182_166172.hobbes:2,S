Big time. Its over 300 bytes long because its embedded in each inline
prefetch and it causes a branch misprediction almost every time. Amazing
what you find when you actually measure stuff 8)
So right now, its faster on PIV to delete the prefetch than use the
current hack, and adding the Athlon fix makes Athlon and PIV faster and
total memory size lower.
