Bah increasing the clients from 14 to 20 the script just fails in some 
meaningless way

On my P4 with the results I posted I am getting no xruns whatsoever with 
either SCHED_FIFO or ISO. As for the pentiumM I've given up trying to 
use that for latency runs since even with everything shut down and the 
file system with journal off running SCHED_FIFO I get 8ms peaks every 20 
seconds. I'll keep blaming reiserfs for that one. Only dropping to 
single user mode and unmounting filesystems can get rid of them.

Yeah I understand. I'm kinda stuck with hardware that either doesn't 
have a problem, or an installation too flawed to use.

Looking at the code I see some bias towards keeping the cpu count too 
high (it decays too slowly) but your results confirm a bigger problem 
definitely exists. At 100% it should behave the same as SCHED_FIFO 
without mlock, and it is not in your test. I simply need to look at my 
code harder.
