Here's why it's great to have both: they have different toolkits.  I'm
really familiar with md's toolkit.  I can do most anything I need.
But I'll bet that I've never gotten a pvmove to finish sucessfully
because I am doing something wrong and I don't know it.
Becuase we're talking about data integrity, the toolkit issue alone
makes it worth keeping both code paths.  md does 90% of what I need,
so why should I spend the time to learn a new system that doesn't
offer any advantages?
