No, sorry. Lossy email compression (sometimes being concise is a virtue 
but I usually fall way too far). Reading thru previous messages seems 
confusing to me. On one side you say that fork() uses a std COW, on the 
other side you say that the unified virtual address space combined with 
virtually tagged cache let you avoid cache flushes. As soon as you COW, 
you have one virtual address that refer to two different physical addresses.
Does the virtual address have extra tag bits to identify the task?
