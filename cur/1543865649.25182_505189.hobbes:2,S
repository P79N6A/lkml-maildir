Subject: [PATCH] [GFS2] Add writepages for "data=writeback" mounts
It occurred to me that although a gfs2 specific writepages for ordered
writes and journaled data would be tricky, by hooking writepages only
for "data=writeback" mounts we could take advantage of not needing
buffer heads (we don't use them on the read side, nor have we for some
time) and create much larger I/Os for the block layer.
Using blktrace both before and after, its possible to see that for large
I/Os, most of the requests generated through writepages are now 1024
sectors after this patch is applied as opposed to 8 sectors before.
