I am in principle interested in doing this, especially since the area of 
our inspiration is not in key management but in performance.

Jason is working on a write only plugin (or at least he said so a few 
months ago) for reiser4.  You probably remember him discussing it then.  
Where is your photo, or are you a CIA spy who needs to keep it 
secret....;-)  I remember three interesting people talked to me all at 
once at that conference about reiser4 crypto and other things that crept 
into that conversation, if you send your photo I can know if I remember 
correctly which one other than Jason you were.
