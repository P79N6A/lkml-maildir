Thanks. I'm not sure either, it would require two concurrent requests
to be processed, but AFAICS oidentd only uses a single netlink socket.
Perhaps multiple running instances or something else using the inet_diag
interface?
You might be able to trigger it without this patch by running
"while true; do ss -tn; done" while doing ident queries, but
just running the while loop a couple of times in parallel
doesn't seem to trigger it here.
