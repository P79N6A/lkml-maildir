I'm CCing this to the list since I know how to unlock the keyboard and where
it might be at.  Comments?

Compiled in both drivers (I'll try with out the I<whatever> driver, I hate
typing that number!).  Right now, I can use pcmcia/cardbus cards in the
laptop.  Yenta doesn't seem to compile as a module right now tho.

I found out that if I move the mouse, the keyboard locks (gpm was running,
/dev/psaux).  The mouse also does not move.  Now, I telnetted into the
machine and started unmounting/killing things for a crash.  I killed gpm and
the keyboard started to work again.  This didn't happen before when (no
pcmcia compiled in before, now both yenta and intel cardbus/pccard is in
kernel)
P.S.  Can anyone recommend a good 10/100 cardbus card other than a 3com
3c575?  I can't download at 100mbit (exceeding ~4 or 5mb/sec) and write to
the hdd w/o the machine locking.  Reply in private on this.
