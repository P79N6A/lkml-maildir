I don't think you assume correctly. Overcurrent indication from the hub 
is supposed to mean that something on the hub is shorted or pulling too 
much current. This discussion is about the kernel refusing to enable 
devices when they would consume more power than the hub they are 
connected to can provide. Regardless of what you do with plugging in 
devices, overcurrent isn't supposed to happen unless something is broken.

Probably either XP ignores the overcurrent indication, or else something 
   in Linux is interacting badly with the controller and causing this 
indication. XP definitely DOES enforce USB power budgeting.
