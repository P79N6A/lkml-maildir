Hello kernel listees
I have a busmaster question I am hoping you can help me with.
If a PCI device is acting as a busmaster and the processor initiates a 
read/write to another device on the PCI bus while the busmater-device is in 
control of the bus what happens to the instructions initiated by the 
processor? Are they never seen by the device that the processor
is trying to read/write?
Thanks for helping me with this,
Daniel
