I'm referring to the metadata rather than to the pages themselves: the zone
structure at least.  I bet there are a couple of cache misses in there.

It's hardly rocket science.  Stick a nid and a counter in the task_struct
for a simple implmentation.

What is "shared data"?

Yes it is.  You're proposing taking an arbitrarily large number of
successive pages from the same node rather than interleaving the allocations.
That will create "hotspots or imbalances" (whatever they are).
