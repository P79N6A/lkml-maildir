for large amounts of data, you should ensure that your application opens 
the open using O_DIRECT.
i have no experience with 3ware controllers, but i have no problem 
sustaining 400MB/s (4gbit/s) to a Fibre Channel-attached JBOD with an 
in-house userspace-based application which maintains its own 
userspace-based filesystem on raw partitions (/dev/sd[b-w]).
using 15K RPM disks i can sustain 400MB/s using just 6 disk spindles and 
what amounts to predominantly sequential writes.
cheers,
lincoln.
