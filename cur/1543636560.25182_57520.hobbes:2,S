OK, evdev is on the userspace side of the input core (and USB is on the other).
If evdev reports events (and you can decode them, if you are interested, using
tools available from the linuxconsole CVS), then all is probably well with USB and
the input core.
The obvious error would be not compiling in the input layer keyboard driver (or
not loading the module, whatever). 
If that definately isn't wrong (like lsmod shows the module, or a normal USB
keyboard works fine and the keypad doesn't), then we'll likely need the 
HID descriptors. Probably easiest to get them from evdev using the evtest
tool from linuxconsole CVS.
