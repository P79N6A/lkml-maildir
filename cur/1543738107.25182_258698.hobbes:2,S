What precisely are you thinking of?
You seem to think this is ridiculous.
The way I read this, Linux is compliant, I think.
[I read this as follows: If you mmap a file with MAP_SHARED and modify
the memory at an address so far beyond EOF that it is not in a page
containing stuff from the file, then you get a SIGBUS. -- Linux does this.
Also, that if you modify the memory at an address beyond EOF, then
the file is not modified. -- Again Linux does this.]
