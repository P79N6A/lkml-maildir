I'm not sure about that one. =)
I had a Pentium 233MMX pc running for 5 years 3 days.  Booted Nov 18th 1999
and was downed due to a UPS failure around Nov 21 2004.
5 years counting 2 leap year days (2000 and 2004), that's 1827 IIRC.
It was running kernel 2.2.13, 64mb ram, 1.6gb disk, it was a dns server nfs
root server and a NIS server.  Other than that it didn't do much.  It did
get use via the network everyday.  Too bad I don't have a last entry from
utmp before it was killed.
If anyone is interested in the last entry, I'll see if I can dig itup from
old backups.
