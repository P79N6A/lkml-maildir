Subject: kernel-source-2.2.19 - error in menuconfig

I downloaded the .deb package for kernel-source-2.2.19.
I tried to run make menuconfig and the following happened...
> bash-2.05# make menuconfig
> rm -f include/asm
> ( cd include ; ln -sf asm-i386 asm)
> make -C scripts/lxdialog all
> make[1]: Entering directory
`/usr/src/kernel-source-2.2.19/scripts/lxdialog'
> make[1]: Leaving directory
`/usr/src/kernel-source-2.2.19/scripts/lxdialog'
> /bin/sh scripts/Menuconfig arch/i386/config.in
> Using defaults found in .config
> Preparing scripts: functions, parsingawk: cannot open "MCmenu19" for
output (Too many open files)
> Awk died with error code 2. Giving up.
> .scripts/Menuconfig: ./MCmenu0: line 34: syntax error near unexpected
token `}'
> scripts/Menuconfig: ./MCmenu0: line 34: `}'
> .....scripts/Menuconfig: ./MCmenu13: line 89: syntax error: unexpected end
of file
> .............done.
then the following error showed up, so I'm reporting it as requested.
