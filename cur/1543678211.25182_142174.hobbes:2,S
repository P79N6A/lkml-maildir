FYI, Chris Wright (one of the main LSM developers) left for a week's 
vacation today. This patch appears to be a major change in how LSM 
works, and I suspect Chris will want some time to consider it. So don't 
be terribly surprised if not much happens until June 30.
However, Chris also told me that he took his laptop with him. He might 
choose to take some of his vacation time to look at this.

I agree with Greg. We deliberately did not design in explicit support. 
The priority scheme was:
   1. Have the least impact possible on kernels not using modules.
   2. Have the best performance possible for a single module.
   3. Push work for stacking modules onto module writers who want to stack.

The problem with module composition is that it is sometimes straight 
forward, but often problematic, and in some cases impossible. You 
*cannot* provide support for module composition in the general case; at 
best it will work sometimes. Wheeler's existing Stacker module 
encapsulates the logistics for supporting module composition in the 
simple cases, and module writers *need* to hack it themselves in the 
harder cases.
