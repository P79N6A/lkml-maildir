Also, noticed another problem in the same general area. Andrew you were
indeed right to question the removal of that unmap_mapping_range call,
but I think even it alone it wasn't enough...

The nopage vs invalidate race fix patch did not take care of truncating
private COW pages. Mind you, I'm pretty sure this was previously racy
even for regular truncate, not to mention vmtruncate_range.
Anyway, fix that omission.
