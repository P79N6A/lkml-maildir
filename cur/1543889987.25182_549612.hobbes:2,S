Hi,
When trying to load input_polldev compiled as a module on my
2.6.22-rc2-mm1 kernel, it is impossible because of some symbols that
are said to be missing :
gonnet@porcinet:~$ sudo modprobe input_polldev
FATAL: Error inserting input_polldev
(/lib/modules/2.6.22-rc2-mm1=porcinet/kernel/drivers/input/misc/input-polldev.ko):
Unknown symbol in module, or unknown parameter (see dmesg)
gonnet@porcinet:~$ dmesg
[  137.559553] input_polldev: Unknown symbol queue_delayed_work
[  137.559621] input_polldev: Unknown symbol destroy_workqueue
[  137.559652] input_polldev: Unknown symbol __create_workqueue
I enclosed my .config in case it may help.
On the other hand, if I choose CONFIG_INPUT_POLLDEV=y, it seems to
work without any problem. Provided the Kconfig file, it looks like
this could compiled either like that or as a module.
Unfortunately, given my very limited understanding i could really not
figure out why these symbols cannot be resolved, so i'll be really
interrested if anyone can propose a solution or an explanation.
Best regards,
Cédric
