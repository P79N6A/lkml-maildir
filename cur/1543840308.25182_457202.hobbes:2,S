Yes, it is perfectly doable, but I don't think anyone has yet bothered
to release a utility that actually does it.
OPPORTUNITY FOR FAME AND FORTUNE! (okay, maybe just some fame):
=================================
Hack the existing smartctl code to read out the failed sector numbers,
and then issue single-sector read-overwrite to each of those bad sectors.
Very simple code.  I'll do it myself eventually, but please beat me to it!
Cheers
