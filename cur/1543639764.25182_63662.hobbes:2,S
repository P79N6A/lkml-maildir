Yes, if you have a journal on your root filesystem, then it will be mounted
as ext3 regardless of what it says in /etc/fstab.  Since "mount" also
looks in /etc/fstab for writing the entry in /etc/mtab _after_ the root
filesystem is mounted, the output from "mount" can also be bogus.  You
need to check /proc/mounts to see the real answer.
Cheers, Andreas
