When implementing a circular buffer it is better to not constrain the head
and tail indices - just let them grow and wrap without bound.  You only need
to bring them in-bounds when you actually use them to index the buffer.
This way,
- head-tail is always the amount of used space, no need to futz around
  handling the case where one has wrapped and the other hasn't.
- you get to use all of the buffer, because the cases head-tail == 0
  (empty) and head-tail == bufsize (full) are now distinguishable.
  It helps if the buffer size is a power of two, of course, but integer
  modulus is pretty quick.
All the net drivers and the printk log buffer implement their ring buffers
in this way; it works nicely.
