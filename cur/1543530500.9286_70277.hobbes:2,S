Exactly.
I'd really like the non-overcommit fans to come up
with a good reason why a non-overcommitting system
doesn't suffer from the same problem, but all I've
seen so far are changes to the problem :)
(and no, I don't believe there is any solution to
OOM on any system that allows userspace to dynamically
allocate memory ....)
cheers,
Rik
