Hi,
I have a problem with accessing a magneto opto drive in Linux.
Since I upgraded the kernel from 2.3 to 2.4 I can mount the MO
drive but if I try to access a file on the drive the kernel oopses...
After the kernel oops the MO can't be unmounted.
The MO is has a SCSI-2 interface and the SCSI interface is a Symbios
NCR8xx type.
Any ideas??
Cheers,
/Tore
