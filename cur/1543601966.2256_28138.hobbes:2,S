hi Robert, thanks for producing the stats patches!
i did a test of it on linux-2.4.10-pre13 with Benno Senoner's
lowlatency program, which i hacked up a bit to output
/proc/latencytimes after each of the graphs.  test results are at
    
http://www.algorithm.com.au/hacking/linux-lowlatency/2.4.10-pre13-pes/
and since i stared at the results in disbelief, i won't even try
to guess what's going on :).  maybe you can make some sense of
it?
i'm prety sure his latencytest program runs at real-time
priority, but i'll run another test just with the getrt and rt
programs just posted to the list to make sure.  that's the only
reason i can think why the graph is so bizarre compared to the
/proc/latencytimes results.
