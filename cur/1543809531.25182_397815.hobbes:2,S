and update_wall_time_one_tick misses out on this bit:
		/* Reduce by this step the amount of time left  */
		time_adjust -= time_adjust_step;
That's why I said that update_wall_time_one_tick needs both
time_adjust_step and delta_nsec.  If you have a nice way to return
both values, please let me know...
