I'm not sure how to say this politely, so please don't take it as a
slight. Hacks to avoid diffsize increases that would result from data
structure code are highly specious. There are typically functionality
or efficiency issues deliberately left unaddressed to accomplish such.
When committing the patch, you generally end up implicitly committed
to later updates to address those issues.
That said, even if some maintainers consciously agree (it's actually
rather clear that my opinion here is not representative of the majority
if anyone else at all), it does still present an issue for "marketing"
patches since diffsize is so easily latched onto as a metric of risk.
Don't worry about it for now. This will do fine.

They're all TLB so picking things up on the TLB side can be done there.
I think they also keep the long format VHPT code updated to recent
mainline, which makes higher-order pages meaningful on ia64 (which with
the region register -based affair they are effectively not).

A more careful reading would reveal this as a criticism of industrial
sponsorship of research, not academia per se. For instance, what IHV
would bother sponsoring research on page replacement, since when
grinding out [trademarked name of major benchmark censored] numbers to
sell their systems, they arrange for page replacement never to happen?
