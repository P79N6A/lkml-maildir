But won't all of the knfsd allocations be by necessity GFP_NOFS to avoid
deadlocks, so they will be unable to clear inodes or dentries?  Both
shrink_icache_memory() and shrink_dcache_memory() do nothing if __GFP_FS
isn't set so if there is no user-space allocation pressure we will never
get into the dcache/icache freeing paths from knfsd allocations.
Cheers, Andreas
