Well, I don't know, that's what I'm asking since the comment in the
driver specifically mentions IA64 :)

Well, existing users of mmiowb() will regress in performances if we
decide that class 1 (ordered) accessors do imply rule #4 (ordering with
locks) since they'll end up doing redundant mmiowb's ;) but then,
they'll be affected anyway to to the sheer amount of mmiowb's (one per
IO) unless you implement the trick I described, which would bring down
the cost to nothing except maybe the test in spin_unlock (which I still
need to measure on PowerPC).

The PowerPC patch is probably good enough for 2.6.18 in fact :) I'll let
Paulus post what he has. It's fairly ppc specific in the actual
implementation though.

Ok :)
