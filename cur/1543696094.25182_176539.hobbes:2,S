Subject: Recurring random freezes with 2.6.0-test9

I have 2.4.22 running fine on this box, before and after
trying 2.6.0-test9.  What happens is that I can use the
box for a few minutes, then it locks up hard for no apparent
reason.  The hard drive light comes on and stays on,
sysrq is unresponsive, and no response via ethernet.
This has happened everytime I've used -test9 (about
4-6 times).  The kernel is compiled for K7 (Athlon).
I have support for IDE disk, VIA vt82c686b, HPT370A,
and PDC20269 compiled in.  There is nothing in any
log file that hints of trouble.  Here's part of syslog, FWIW:
kernel: PCI: Probing PCI hardware

Is there anything else I can provide that would be useful?
Is there anything I can turn on to get more info when this happens?
