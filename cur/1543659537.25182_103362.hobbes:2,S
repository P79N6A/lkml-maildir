It has been my experience that distro kernels come with everything and
then more of everything. Sure, they're mostly modular, but this approach
adds complexity that's unnecessary. So, I normally get kernel.org stable
kernel source and build a non-modular kernel specifically for my
hardware. 
I was just trying to determine how security patches are handle by the
kernel developers, that's all. The idea that people should look to
distros for security is absurd to me, especially if the bug in question
affects the vanilla kernel.
