I just put a new kernel on a server and all of a sudden I'm see'ing
this:
sending pkt_too_big (len[1500] pmtu[1442]) to self
sending pkt_too_big (len[1500] pmtu[1442]) to self
sending pkt_too_big (len[1500] pmtu[1442]) to self
sending pkt_too_big (len[1500] pmtu[1442]) to self
A LOT in my dmesg.  I think it's most likely an app which is doing
something stupid but I'd like confirmation before I go smack someone.
:wq!
