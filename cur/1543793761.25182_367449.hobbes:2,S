Hi all,
I got a problem on 2.6.12. As follows:
-test.c
int main(void)
{
 alarm(3);
 execl("sig_rev","sig_rev","3",0);
 sleep(10);
 return 0;
}
-sig_rev.c
int main(void)
{
 sleep(10);
 return 0;
}
Running test can't stop in 3 seconds. But it should be.
Because the case can run properly on 2.6.11 and 2.6.13.
What difference about it?
Welcome any suggestions and comments
Thanks
-Aubrey
