thanks for the patch (it has a little problem, since it uses prio 99 which
is always equal or greater than the rtc thread prio. i changed it in my
local version to accept a parameter). will do some more cleanup of the
program [saner option handling, msec/usec output of the relevant cycle
counts, history file output, ctrl-c handling etc].
U\L in an hour or two.
