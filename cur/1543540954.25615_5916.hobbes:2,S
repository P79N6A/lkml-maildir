One interesting aspect to linux development that I've seen is a large amount of dialogue*, but a lack of common definitions.  I was wondering if anyone would care to define what consitutes a 'feature' in contrast to a 'bug fix' when it comes to the linux kernel.  Specific definitions could really help new contributers to the kernel, rather than the rather arbitrary standards that are being applied now.

* One does wonder whether alot of the traffic constitutes dialogue or just idle positioning and cock-strutting.
