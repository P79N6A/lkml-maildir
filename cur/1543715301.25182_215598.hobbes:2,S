mask1-bitmap-comment - Document bitmap.c bit model.
        Document the bitmap bit model, including handling of unused bits,
        and operation preconditions and postconditions.

+ * bitmaps provide an array of bits, implemented using an an
+ * array of unsigned longs.  The number of valid bits in a
+ * given bitmap need not be an exact multiple of BITS_PER_LONG.
+ *
+ * The possible unused bits in the last, partially used word
+ * of a bitmap are 'don't care'.  The implementation makes
+ * no particular effort to keep them zero.  It ensures that
+ * their value will not affect the results of any operation.
+ * The bitmap operations that return Boolean (bitmap_empty,
+ * for example) or scalar (bitmap_weight, for example) results
+ * carefully filter out these unused bits from impacting their
+ * results.
+ *
+ * Except for bitmap_complement, these operations hold to a
+ * slightly stronger rule: if you don't input any bitmaps to
+ * these ops that have some unused bits set, then they won't
+ * output any set unused bits in output bitmaps.
