There's another difference.  Mounting a cdrom or usb stick needs
_physical_ access to the machine in question.  If you have physical
access you don't need to craft special filesystems to crash the
machine, just pull out the plug from the wall.
So network/userspace filesystems which allow the user to mount an
arbitrary server should be _extra_ careful to verify data from the
server.  Otherwise they can remotely crash the machine or gain
elevated privileges.
