Indeed there is not.  That's what I wrote in an earlier email:
  "There should be one single ioctl which can be applied uniformly to all
  CD-type devices (in fact, to all devices using a request_queue) to learn
  max_sectors.  This rules out using SG_GET_RESERVED_SIZE."

How do you feel about the patch below, either in addition to or instead of 
the previous patch?
