hi,
i 'm trying to raise the 32-groups-per-user limit in my 2.0.33 kernel 
running on a single cpu pentium system.
is it a possible and safe way to raise the limit to 64 or even more by just 
setting NGROUPS_MAX in include/linux/limits.h?
any help very much appreciated,
please set me on "cc" since i am not a member of this list.
thank you.
lucas
