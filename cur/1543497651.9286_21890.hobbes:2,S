Hi,
with lspci i find this card ...
00:08.0 Communication controller: PLX Technology, Inc.: Unknown device 906d (rev 02)
        Subsystem: Unknown device 125c:0640
It is a PLX 9060SD Based Multiport PCI Card. Currently i search for
PLX Tech with device id = 906d - But this matches only the generic
PCI Chip. How do i check against the Subsytem ID to be shure
i have the correct card ?
if (!(pcibios_find_device(PCI_VENDOR_ID_PLXTECH,
		PCI_DEVICE_ID_9060SD,
		pci_index, &pci_bus,
		&pci_device_fn))) {
	pdev = pci_find_slot(pci_bus, pci_device_fn);
	/*
	 * And what to do now to match on the SubsysID ?
	 */
}
Flo
