The controller runs in RAID mode on the "smart" cards even without raid 
definitions being used - its still doing the hardware assist.

Currently it always picks 50MHz, thats a feature I'm still working on 
adding intelligence to

It was sent a command it didnt know.
The UDMA33 speed behaviour looks to me like cable detect got the wrong

so it may be that its in the docs but doesn't actually work or isnt wired
on the boards. Can you see what the ata66 function is doing ?
