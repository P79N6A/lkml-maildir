Just an addition to the sample:
fds[3] = sem3;
fds[4] = sem4;
fds[5] = sem5;
fds[6] = sem6;
.. and wait for any of them? or for all together?
and sure have this mixed with descriptors.
Wellknown win32 api WaitForMultipleObjects provides such
functionality, and having something like
that would help to port the applications using that api.

 Hi, all
 i am missing a good (i think) feature of unix descriptors
 in SysV semaphores - to be poll(2)-able.
 Have someone an idea to somehow achieve the goal ? 
 something like this:
 int sem = create_our_pollable_semaphore();
 ...
 ...
 pollfd fds[xxx];
 for(i=0; i < countof(fds); fds[i++].events = POLLIN|POLLOUT);
 fds[0].fd = sem;
 fds[1].fd = server_sock1;
 fds[2].fd = cmd_sock2;
 
 while ( poll(fds, countof(fds), -1) >= 0 )
  ...
 
 Thank you in advance
