Right.

Great! The "complete source code" for the kernel does include each and
every single patch applied since linux-0.0.1? Guess I'll have to complain
to a certain Torvalds then...
Don't be silly. "Complete source code" means the source needed to rebuild
the binary, nothing more. If that is a mangled version derived from some
other  source, so be it. You are explicitly allowed to distribute changed
versions, but only under GPL. [IANAL etc, so...]
