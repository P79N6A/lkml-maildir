anyway, this alternative patch should help. it should be more like the <= 2.6.16
behavior.
[ CC'ing Marcus Better as the tester of the original patch. ]
Marcus, could you test this patch instead of the original one and see how your
cardbus cards behave?
Dave, your SCSI card should work with this as well :)
with this patch my old toshiba laptop shows this in dmesg:
	PCI: PCI BIOS revision 2.10 entry at 0xf1987, last bus=21
	PCI: Using configuration type 1
ie. like kernel 2.6.16 and earlier...2.6.17+ would only show the pci bios line,
while with the earlier patch it only shows the type 1 line
