Is there any possibility to set the values for IPC-ressources
(SHM/SEM) other than by changing the headerfiles?
A software we want to install wants us to have set the following
values:
SHM MAX 33554432
SHM MIN 1
    MNI 128
    SEG 128
SEM MNI 128
SEM MNS 4096
SEM MNU 4096
SEM ONE 32
    MSL 32
    MAP 4096
I know from HPUX that there is something like /etc/system for this kind of
params...
