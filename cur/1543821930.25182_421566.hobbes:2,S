The length of the kernel command line will be limited by the size of 
the boot loader buffer.  LILO always inserts a NUL terminator.

P.S.  The LILO command line buffer has always been 1 sector (512 
bytes); however, only the first half is actually used for the command 
line. No kernel can do any harm by setting "boot_cmdline[511] = 0;" 
for any version of LILO back to version 20 (and probably before).
