This question is GCC PR33102, which was incorrectly closed as a 
duplicate
of PR3506 -- and *that* PR was closed because its reporter seemed to
claim the GCC generated code for an increment on a volatile (namely, 
three
machine instructions: load, modify, store) was incorrect, and it has to
be one machine instruction.

And even there, it's not something the kernel can take advantage of
before GCC 4.4 is in widespread use, if then.  Let's move on.
