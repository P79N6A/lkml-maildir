Hello!
There is a difference (subjective) feeling between 2.6.0test4 kernels
and 2.6.0test6 kernels:
When I press one key and wait how fast it repeats printing it differs
between those kernels.
test4:
   very fast, very smooth. I like that. it's like it latter 2.5 series
test6:
   more or less fast; like in 2.4 series.
Can you tell me what you changed and howto regain this smooth handling from
test4?
I don't think kbdrate will be the right tools, as the difference was seen/
recognizable on console and under X.
Have a nice day,
Nico
