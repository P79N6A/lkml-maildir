Linux 2.4.3, Debian Woody.  2.4.2 works without problems.  However, in
2.4.3, pcnet32 loads, gives an error message:

Though it does still load.
However, the interface does not come up.  (DHCP doesn't work, can't even
assign a manual address). 
Worse, I get multiple entries for the driver in /proc/interrupts.  Each 
time I attempt to bring the interface up another is added so I have:
  5:      11276      11416   IO-APIC-level  aic7xxx, PCnet/FAST 79C971,
PCnet/FAST 79C971, PCnet/FAST 79C971
When I attempt to rmmod the driver, even if there is only one, I get a
Kernel OOPS (in the interrupt handler, so it wasn't written
anywhere).  I'll attempt to copy it down by hand and post to the list in a
bit.
