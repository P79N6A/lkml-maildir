This question is more about hardware, but is also related to Linux.
If I have a harddisk, plugged into the motherboard (IDE cable and power),
can I turn it off, plugging out first power cable, then IDE cable.
Can it harm harddisk or motherboard?
If I can do it, then will Linux detect it back, if I make this 
operation back: i.e. plug IDE cable, then power cable.
Best regards.
