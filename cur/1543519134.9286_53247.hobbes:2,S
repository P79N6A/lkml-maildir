Hello,
I am trying to learn the inner workings of the networking code.
Mainly IP.  I've come up with a few questions that (even after
grepping like mad, and reading several books) I can't answer.
One is, I can't figure out in what context the IP send code (eg,
ip_queue_xmit) is executed.  Is it in interrupt context?  If so, with
interrupts enabled? (ie, like a bh).  What pieces of code should I be
looking at?
My next question involves the use of dev->tbusy in the drivers' send
routine.  Am I correct in my assumption that setting dev->tbusy to a
non-zero value causes the upper layers to block?  Also, what would be
the best strategy for sending packets with an interface that has the
ability to queue many packets in hardware?[1]  Would it be good to
just copy each packet to the interface and only set dev->tbusy to true
when the card's queue is full?
Any help would be much appreciated.  Please forgive my general
cluelessness if I said something really dumb!
-Dan
[1] The interface in question is a Myricom device, _not_ running any
of the Myri MCPs.
