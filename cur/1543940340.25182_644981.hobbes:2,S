I'm just making a long test run on my TQM5200 module with my good
settings. After more than 4.5 hours under load, cyclictest shows a
maximum latency of 177 us. I'm going to re-check the effect of CONFIG_NO_HZ.

It's also my suspicion that the high latencies are related to the RCU
usage in the network layer, where it's heavily used. What is really
wired is that switching off CONFIG_RCU_TRACE has a negative impact on
the latency. As I see it, it just adds some trace points, but I might
have missed something.
