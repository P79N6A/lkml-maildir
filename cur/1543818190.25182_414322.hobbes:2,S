$ grep -n driverfs_dev block/genhd.c
558:    physdev = disk->driverfs_dev;

Hmm, okay, genhd contains a reference to a device object, but there's
no sign of _any_ refcounting in sight.
What's happening is that the MMC card block device is setup and registered
with genhd.  We set md->disk->driverfs_dev to point at the owning device
structure.
This generates a uevent, which causes disk->driverfs_dev to be dereferenced.
All fine here.  We mount the partition, which causes another uevent to be
generated, again dereferencing disk->driverfs_dev.
If we remove the MMC card, we destroy the MMC card block device.  This
seems to generate another uevent for the block device.  At this point,
the counted references to the MMC card block device fall to zero.
But wait!  There's still uncounted disk->driverfs_dev reference waiting
for...
You unmount the partition.  This calls block_uevent, which dereferences
disk->driverfs_dev.  You know what happens now.
The levels above genhd can't do the refcounting because they don't know
when stuff has finished with driverfs_dev.  So the only place for sane
refcounting seems to be genhd.c, as per the patch below.
Comments?
