that sounds like a perfect job for a udev-kind of notification to
userspace, eg "hey I migrated", and then udev/hotplug can just do this
sending of arps.. maybe they also want to do other things just after a
migration (which sounds entirely reasonable to me) such as renewing the
dhcp lease, resetting the periodic userspace hardware polling timers in
"hal", network manager etc etc... 
so it looks entirely useful for me to have a userspace upcall for "post
migration", and once you have that that udev side of things can just do
this...
(question is if you also want a pre-migration upcall; my gut feeling
says "no" because upcalls are async and you may end up running that
upcall on the new physical machine)
