We've been through this before.

In addition, the SMI call used to change the backlight level *may*
require (if configured by the sysadmin in BIOS), a password be
entered.
This begs for a common userspace app that can grok libsmbios and
kernel interfaces both, and use the appropriate method on each, rather
than just putting it all in the kernel.
