If you don't have an interrupt pending bit you are probably completely screwed.
PCI assumes you can tell if you caused the interrupt or you can service events
even if not needed (which basically comes down to the same thing).
Only your driver knows if you are a possible IRQ cause, its up to you to
handle it
