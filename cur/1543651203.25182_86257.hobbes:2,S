I think the most important aspects are always that the concept is
understandable, doesn't make the users to jump through hoops, and
doesn't violate the principle of least surprise too often.

This happens if you have a design that is based on taking away
privileges/rights/capabilities/power/whatever. If the "naked"
object has no special powers, misfiling it does no damage at all.
Of course, you want to make sure nothing else can be slipped into
that magic drawer. Just imagine somebody takes the GPL from The
Drawer of World Domination, and puts the Windows EULA there :-)
