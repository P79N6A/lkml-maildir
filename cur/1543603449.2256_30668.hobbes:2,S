this code was added by Robert to check something; cant remember the
details on that specific date. The goal is to test variuos workloads and
conditions before reaching  conclusions; so it might have been valid on
that day only
Take it out and things should work just fine.

You misunderstood. This is to enforce fairness. Read the paper. When
you have one device sending 100Kpps and another sending 1pps to the stack,
you wanna make sure that the 1pps doesnt get starved -- thats what the
purpose of the above code is (hence the Round  robin scheduling and the
quota per device).

Again, you misunderstood. Please spend a few more minutes reading the code
and i should insist you read the paper ;->
The interupt just flags "i, netdev, have work to do"; the the poll thread
grabs packets off it when the softirq gets scheduled. So we dont do
unecessary polling; we only poll when  there is work to be done.
In the low-load case this solution reduces to the same as interupt driven
system and scales to the system/CPU capacity.

The poll thread is run as softirq, just as the other half of networking is
today. And as should be because networking is extremely important as a
subsyestem.

we can make it 100% successful; i mentioned that we only do work, if there
is work to be done.
