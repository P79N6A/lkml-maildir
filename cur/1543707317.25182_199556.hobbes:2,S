Actually, the #ifdef around that function is wrong:
#if defined(CONFIG_NUMA) || defined(CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU)
/* If dest_cpu is allowed for this process, migrate us to it. */
void migrate_to_cpu(int dest_cpu)
We don't use this for HOTPLUG_CPU, but we call __migrate_task()
directly.
ie. #ifdef CONFIG_NUMA is sufficient.
I do think this is an obviously good idea though.
Rusty.
