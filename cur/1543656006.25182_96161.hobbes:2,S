Well, in my case the modules load fine and appear to be working but pump 
gets errors and cannot use dhcp to get me an address.  When I manually configure
the interface with an IP then it works fine.  No idea what the proble with
that is.
Anyway, have you run "ifconfig" and "iwconfig" on the device to check that
the settings are alright?  If they are then manually give it an IP and see
if that works.
