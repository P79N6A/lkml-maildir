ReiserFS 6 plans to allow files to be associated with arbitrary files 
and found by those associations.  Some of those files will consist of 
ascii keywords, some will be icon images, etc.....  Human readability 
should not be considered fundamental to a name component, especially 
since programs with no interest in readability may be the only direct 
users of the name.
