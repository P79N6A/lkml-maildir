How about fixing it first ?

This is insufficient. It has to lock against card interrupts and other
arbitary ill defined (in 2.4 anyway) suspend things. Assuming the PM
layer can mind its own business nowdays you are at least going to want
to take the card lock. I think thats mostly sufficient for the maestro
case. There is a long standing question about whether the resume code
should end by calling the irq handler to fake any missed IRQ pending
over the suspend of the card - but thats also true in the 2.4 case.
