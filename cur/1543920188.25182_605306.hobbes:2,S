You would be the third student to take on that project
simultaneously.  That is not a problem for me (on the
contrary, it increases the chances of one codebase being
likeable to Linus), but it does decrease the chances of
your patch being the one to make it upstream.
Still, it should be a fun project to implement and
benchmark, so go ahead if you want.
