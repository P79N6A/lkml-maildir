If your platform is up to date then you can set arbitary speeds via the
TIOCGETS2/TIOCSETS2 ioctls. Not all platforms support this yet although
I'm working on getting the sane ones all upstream and sorted. Once that
is done glibc will be able to switch internally to TIOCGETS2/SETS2 for
the termios operations it provides and the world will be a far happier
place ...
