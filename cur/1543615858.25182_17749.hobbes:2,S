Subject: In kernel routing table vs. /sbin/ip vs. /sbin/route

Using /sbin/route, I can add multiple default routes like so:
/sbin/route add -net default gw 192.168.0.1
/sbin/route add -net default gw 192.168.0.2
But I cannot do the same with /sbin/ip:
/sbin/ip route add default via 192.168.0.1
/sbin/ip route add default via 192.168.0.2
RTNETLINK answers: File exists
Given that /sbin/ip is the more powerful and modern tool, I'm lead to
believe that /sbin/route might be leaving the in kernel routing table in a 
weird state.
My two simple questions are as follows:
1) Which tool is more correct?
2) What is the behavior of the kernel when multiple default routes are 
defined?
Thanks,
davez
