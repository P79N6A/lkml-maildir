Subject: TCP retransmission : how to detect from an application ?

Hello,
I've an application that is establishing TCP connection, and exchanges some
data.
However, from time to time, I suspect there are some packet loss, which are
corrected by the kernel (hell, TCP is reliable, isn't it :-), but I'd like
to know if an application can detect this (well, I don't want to be notified
of a packet loss once detected, but I'd like to get some stats before
closing
the connection).
Is there something possible ? Some ioctl ? Some /proc/magic-interface ?
Regards,
Paul
