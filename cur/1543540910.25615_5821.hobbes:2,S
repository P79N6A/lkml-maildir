What is "touch"? (Changing atime and mtime?) If it does not change ACL state, it should not
matter. If it does, it should generate an entry in the list (but without saying that this
entry takes effect for all the members of the (possible) directory, only for the fs object
itself.) However, you might be right that atime|mtime of the files changed might not represent
the "atomic", "immediate" change of the bunch of ACLs. (3) might set atime|mtime after (2),
but is this a problem? I feel that I do not get the gist of what you think of, please clarify.

You are right, at least without two-way links.
But I fear the NFSv4 only supports file-centric, not directory-centric ACLs. So this approach
and NFSv4 ACLs might be incompatible unless two-way links are used (this way, the resulting
ACL set is ACL1 OR ACL2 OR ... OR ACLn where ACLk is the ACL from the kth directory entry.)
(But if you had two-way links you could also determine if the file in question would have been
touched by the pending ACL change requests.)

Xuân. :o)
P.S.: Maybe Hans' solution is better. :o)
