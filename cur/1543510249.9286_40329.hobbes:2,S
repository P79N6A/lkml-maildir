Alan, I assume you mean the scanner is doing the dumb
things to the scsi bus? I've seen some problems when
I had more than one external device on with the 
scanner. Never could quite pin it down or reproduce it.
Things like corrupted files on a Jaz 2GB drive, scsi
bus lockups... rare but annoying. 
That was with the BT950 card and multiple devices. I
wonder if my own experience was a combination of dumbness
in the scanner and the spin lock problems in the buslogic
scsi driver that were discussed awhile back...
As I noted, I tried sane at one point and couldn't get
it working. I'd get bus lockups and have to reboot.
So I put that project into the round tuit file...
