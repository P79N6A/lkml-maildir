we don't really have hotplug anymore. Now it is all handled by udev or
the udev helper programs.
For my drivers, I don't have this problem of different firmware images
for different versions and I personally don't really like abusing the
firmware name for some kind of revision control. However initially the
idea behind request_firmware() was that the userspace is totally dumb
and its only job is to copy a binary image from the filesystem into the
kernel memory, so it can be used by the driver. Another idea was that we
can reuse the firmware filenames from the Windows driver if they are
separate from the driver. This allowed us in most cases to tell the end
users to simply extract that file and copy it to /lib/firmware/ and
everything was working.
So for the fist step, I think a MODULE_FIRMWARE() extension (with maybe
and additional comment per firmware name) will be a good think to feed
back the information of firmware files to the userspace. After that we
might need to look into messed up devices and drivers. I also expect
that some WiFi drivers might have the same problem.

Marcel
