Sounds bad.
BTW, when I took over from Vojtech, I looked at the suspend methods
for the printer and it seemed possible that they can only work
if the device is not open when suspend occurs. I was going to look
at that at the first opportunity.
So, I'd rather keep at least some kind of capability to suspend
printers, even if disabled by default. I thought Matthew's patch
was too harsh.
