   Things have been changing a lot in the 2.4 ide driver.  Try Alan's ac 
kernel.  That's where all of the ide bug fixing is being done.
1)Apply ac patch
- cd ~
- wget 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/alan/linux-2.4/2.4.20/patch-2.4.20-ac1.bz2
- cd /usr/src/
- cp -a linux-2.4.20 linux-2.4.20-ac1
- cd linux-2.4.20-ac1
- bzcat ~/patch-2.4.20-ac1.bz2|   patch -p1
2)Compile and install kernel
- cp .config 1
- make mrproper
- cp 1 .config
- make oldconfig
- make dep bzImage modules modules_install install
3)If you still have issues send an email to the list with 2.4.20-ac1 in 
the subject.  Include:
- ide section of dmesg
- output of "hdparm -vi <drive>"
- results of "hdparm -d 1 <drive>"  including any thing that shows up in 
dmesg afterwards.
