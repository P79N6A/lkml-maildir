Subject: More NFS client problems with 2.4.20

This is a follow-up to the previous post on NFS client problems with
the RedHat 2.4.18 - 2.4.20 kernels.
After 3 weeks of no problems, the problem showed up again on a
different cluster node.  Four out of 12 nodes have now shown this
problem, but it seems to affect nodes randomly.  It always occurs
during heavy NFS writes.  A job running on the problem node stops,
waiting for NFS read/writes.  All of the other nodes continue to see
the NFS server just fine.  If I try to do an ls on the NFS mount point
on the problem node, the shell locks up.
Checking nfsstat, retrans is not going up, however, getattr is
increasing about 2 per sec.  Also, the stuck processes always show a
WCHAN of "end".
Any ideas what is going wrong?
Thanks,
Joshua Weage
