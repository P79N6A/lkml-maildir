If each of these co-routines does "while (read() != EAGAIN) wait",
your implementation is seriously flawed unless you do not mind certain
file descriptors that may have lower numbers to have a real time
priority higher than file descriptors with a higher number.
If efficiency is the true goal - the event loop itself needs to be
abstracted - not just the query and dispatch routines. Using /dev/epoll
in a way that it is compatible with other applications is an excercise
in abuse, that will only show positive results because the alternatives
to /dev/epoll are ineffective, not because /dev/epoll is a better model.
I like the idea of /dev/epoll - which means that if I used it, I would
implement an efficient model with it, not a traditional model that through
hackery will function transparently using /dev/epoll.
But that might just be me...
