You are presupposing that all the developers are checking in many bad changes
and only one good change.  And that all the bad changes are obscuring the
good ones.  That a correct statement of your beliefs?
If so, what you are describing is called "hacking" in the negative
sense of the word, and what my customers do is called "programming".
It's quite rare to see the sort of mess that you described, it happens,
but it is rare.  I don'tknow how else to explain it, but it is not the
norm in the professional world to try a zillion different approaches
and revision control each and every one.
The norm is:
	clone a repository
	edit the files
	modify/compile/debug until it works
	check in
	push the patch up the shared repository
I'm really at a loss as to why that shouldn't be the norm here as well.
