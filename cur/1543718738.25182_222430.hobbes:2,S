Well based on Trond's words it's not clear whether we should be proceeding
this way.  Although I think he said "the code is crap and someone should
rewrite it".  Fine, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be fixing oopses in
the current stuff.
I fixed up the big reject which this threw - it's getting a bit optimistic
sending out patches against 2.6.5...
