I have a list that works like this currently and it's a major pain.
Approving a message that's bounced is an annoyance so all the owners
assume someone else will approve it. There's also no granularity in
passwords, so moderators are effectively owners.

Hacking the duplicate filter that's needed into Majordomo (it has to be in
resend for this purpose, trust me) was also a pain. I offered them to
David a couple times in the last few years, but he's never shown any
interest.
Meanwhile, Majordomo 2 is nearing a useful state. It already knows about
duplicates (based on message bodies as well as IDs), multiple owners,
moderators, MIME, real digests, sub-lists, parsing addresses, MTAs other
than Sendmail, proper bounce processing, users with multiple addresses,
database subscriber backends, ticket-based approval, running as a daemon,
etc., etc. so investing much more effort in MJ 1.9x is a waste of time.
Instead, help out with MJ2:
