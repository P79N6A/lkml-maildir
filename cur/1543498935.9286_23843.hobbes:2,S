But look for example at this code-fragment from samba-2.0.4b (latest). They are
aware of byteordering and alingment issues. Compile samba with egcs-1.1.2 and
expect wired problems with netbios names on x86, which are hard to reproduce.
This code triggers the mentioned bug (the high byte of the calculated offset
will be set to random values). For the linux kernel, fortunately  only the 
pcbit driver seems to be affected (I checked the whole kernel with smp and all
scsi and network-drivers).
