The problem here is really with the name 'INPUT'.  It is not an
'input' subsytem, but rather an 'event' subsystem.  It handles events
like key presses, mounts movements, speaker beeps, LED on/off etc.
It could quite reasonable also be used for APCI events like power
status changes and power-button events, but I don't know that anyone
has any plans for that.
I gather the event subsystem was conceived to help managed the wide
variety of input devices (USB, PS/2, serial, etc) and was
inadvertantly misnamed 'input'.
  find linux -type f | xargs perl -pi -e 's/input/event/i'
 or something like that :-)
