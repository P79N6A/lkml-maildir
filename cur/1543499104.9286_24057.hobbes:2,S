I am not so sure about this being a distribution problem. My system is a
FIC PA-2012 (VIA VP3 chips, no hardware monitoring features) running a
severely modified RedHat 5.2. With kernel 2.0.36 shutdown -h turns off
the power but no 2.2.x or 2.3.x kernel does. I have not been able to
isolate the point where this feature stopped working on my system but I
think it was somewhere between 2.1.50 and 2.1.80 - a looong time ago.
