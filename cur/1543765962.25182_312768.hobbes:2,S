Dear diary, on Wed, Apr 20, 2005 at 12:38:17AM CEST, I got a letter
where Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org> told me that...

FYI, I've - per Junio's suggestion - made git merge's fast-forward to
apply show-diff output as a patch instead. This is roughly equal to
doing the sanity check against local changes, except that it handles
them, while at it. (Tree merge refuses to work when there are local
changes.)
