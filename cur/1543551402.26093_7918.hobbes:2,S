Thanks for the info about this link...I never can seem to keep up with
all the good linux kernel links like that one.  You are doing a great job.
Can I suggest a thing or two:
  * Include a small TOC with links to the corresponding section in the doc.
  * Have some predefined keywords that might be useful for searching through
the file; example: (keyword: NFS FS)
  * Include some form of platform identification (platform: ALL, ix86,
PPC,etc)
Some of these might even be useful as some XML tags...but that's a whole
different thread.

Well...my reason for suggesting it though, is because if we keep the TODO as
part of
the actual kernel tree...we can maintain a mapping of known problems and
tasks that
related to a given kernel.
How is maintaining it as a TODO/Changes file within the kernel tree any
different then a file in the kernel tree itself?
If an individual, fixes, say a driver for a given type of sound card, the
person could give a brief, "This driver has been fixed comment" (maybe even
taken from some kind of cvs type comment for the update), remove the "Needs
to be fixed", then do the corresponding patch creation including the TODO
and/or Changes file as part of the files to patch.
I would guess the only possible problem might be getting people into the
habit of changing the TODOs and/or Changes.
The benefit of this of couse, is that more than one person can work on it at
a time.  Although I still think at least one person should monitor it (and
even clean it up regularly).  That person would every so often, remove
previously fixed bugs after the next release is available, to avoid run away
TODO files sizes.
