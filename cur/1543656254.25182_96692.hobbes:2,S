Wow you work fast. ;-)

(I think you mean thermal sensors)
A solution in search of a problem. I can say this because I helped define
it. :)
The machines that care about manageability (servers) appear to be entirely
disjoint from the ones that have thermal zones (and, servers use IPMI),
therefore thermal chip contention doesn't happen. And, Metolious required a
fair amount of AML code.
