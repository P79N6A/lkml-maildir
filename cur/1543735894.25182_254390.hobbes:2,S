Subject: The new PCI fixup code ate my IDE controller

The new DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_HEADER() now makes the order of fixups depend
on link order.  This is a bad thing because it's now one more thing that
link order is used to determine.  Eventually, we're going to have a knot
where you can't move link order to make everything work.
The specific problem here is that quirk_ide_bases() is called before
superio_fixup_pci().  This is only a problem on PA-RISC.  I can see
a few solutions to this.  First, we can move the whole suckyio driver
to arch/parisc, ensuring it gets linked before drivers/pci.  Second,
just move the DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_HEADER to arch/parisc.  Third, link
drivers/parisc ahead of drivers/pci (what other fun ordering problems
might we have?)  Fourth, move the IDE quirk from drivers/pci/quirks.c
to drivers/ide somewhere (which is linked after drivers/parisc so would
happen to fix our problem).  Fifth, back out the quirk changes.  Sixth,
change the pci fixup stuff to sort the quirks by vendor ID (PCI_ANY_ID
sorts after any other ID).
Suggestions?

"Next the statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon 
the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
