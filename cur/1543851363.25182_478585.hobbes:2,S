No silly ":mV" on the file name.

Sure, what's wrong with:
	capacity_remaining_power
	capacity_last_full_power
	capacity_design_min_power
if you can read that from the battery, and:
	capacity_remaining_current
	capacity_last_full_current
	capacity_design_min_current
if you can read that instead.

If the file isn't there, they the attribute isn't present.  It doesn't
get easier than that.
And of course user apps will have to change, but only once.  And then
they will work with all types of batterys, unlike today.
