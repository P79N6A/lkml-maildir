This kind of mails and sentence makes you lost your credibility :
	1) You said that ACPI will be merged in 2.4.22-pre,
	2) For many people ACPI (and aic7xxx) is top priority for 2.4 kernel 
(see various post including alan). The reason being that most laptop are 
unusable nowadays without ACPI,
	3) You do not explicitely says what you plan for 2.4.22...
So, for stupid people like me, could you take a little time to explains 
the dummy's what are your views about what is top priority for kernel 
and for what reasons?
I would personnally suggest that you classify the things using the 
following filter :
	a) Server (SMP, SCSI, RAID, journaling filesystems, ...),
	b) laptop (ACPI, CPUFREQ, Software suspend, IDE power save,...),
	c) desktop (File system efficiency, new hardware support,...),
	d) all systems
Or maybe you simply think that software engineering is a kind of black 
art that is too hard to understand for average people...
