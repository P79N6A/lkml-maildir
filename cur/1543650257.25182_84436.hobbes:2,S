This will make the API to be really error prone by giving the user the
impression that he can go sleeping for a given fd each time he wants. The
rule "you can wait for events only after you received EAGAIN" looks like a
very short and precise rule. On the contrary of "you can go wait for
events after you received EAGAIN or after accept/connect". And the fact on
using the fd immediately after an accept/connect is enforced by two very
likely facts :
1) on accept() it's very likely that the first packet brough you something
	more than SYN
2) on connect() you have the full I/O write space available
