There are several places as its used on both the fh encoding and fh
decoding routines.

This is dealing with the error case only. If the function being called
returns an error (signaled by IS_ERR(inode) - hence an invalid pointer
value) then we need to return that error to the calling routing. Since
this function in question returns a dentry, we convert the invalid
pointer value from the function returning an inode into an integer and
then covert the integer into an invalid pointer value again, but this
time its an invalid pointer to a dentry and hence the correct return
type for this function.
So the caller of this function will get a pointer to a dentry which will
either be a valid dentry pointer or an error value testable with
IS_ERR().
Steve.
