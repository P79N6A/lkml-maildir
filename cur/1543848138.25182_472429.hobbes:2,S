the problem is not lockdep but that the BIOS enables IRQs behind the 
back of the kernel. Lockdep needs to be taught about that - if this 
happens unconditionally then i'd suggest to insert an unconditional 
trace_hardirqs_on() call to after the local_irq_save() that we do prior 
calling the BIOS. (that will be a NOP if lockdep is not enabled)
