Subject: [PATCH 0/3] A kernel tracing interface
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

These patches provide a kernel tracing interface called "trace".
ChangeLog:
-Updated to 2.6.25-rc2-mm1
-Removed sem_watch example, to hard to maintain.
-Added a new example that demonstrates per-cpu continuous tracing
 of data generated using marker probes.
-Removed inline from relay patch.
-Moved examples into /sample directory.
The motivation for "trace" is to:
- Provide a simple set of tracing primitives that will utilize the high-
  performance and low-overhead of relayfs for passing traces data from
  kernel to user space.
- Provide a common user interface for managing kernel traces.
- Allow for binary as well as ascii trace data.
- Incorporate features from the systemtap runtime that are
  useful to others.
Patches are built against 2.6.25-rc2-mm1.
Tested on: 2.6.25-rc3
Summary of patches:
[patch 1/3]  Relay Reset Consumed
[patch 2/3]  Trace code and documentation
[patch 3/3]  Trace sample
Note: Patch 1/3 provides a service used by patch 2/3
thus must be applied first or at the same time.
