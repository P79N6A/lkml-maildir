OK, my bad. I thought global suspend could occur
with devices plugged in, if not that makes #1 a non issue.
The PIIX4E (same ID, same bug) is used in some laptops.
I would assume the 99% of laptop users without the OC
condition would like to save power.
I don't want to get in the way of the vast majority
of users for these rare special cases.
Since the thrashing is not a problem (no global suspend
when a device is plugged in), the only downside of
your original qualify wakeup plan is the possibility of
missing a valid resume once a transient OC condition is cleared.
Maybe just polling individual ports for OC cleared and
RD set to do a global wakeup?
You convinced me that the qualified wakeup is the
way to go.
