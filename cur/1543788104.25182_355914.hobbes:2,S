Hi Rajesh,
Thanks a lot, for ending my doubts. I am working on a hardware that is
still under development. So the chances of missing certain things in
hardware / BIOS are high.  So the solution for this is to ask my
Hardware vendor to provide the information for these bridges into the
ACPI namespace (AML / DSDT?)?
Thanks a ton,
Rajat
