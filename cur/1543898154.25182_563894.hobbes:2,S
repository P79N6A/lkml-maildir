We already have that information in git.  Parse the git changelogs of the
affected files, find out who works on them.
Not that it'll help much, given the amnount of stuff which gets
mysteriously ignored even when the correct people are cc'ed...
(For extra giggles we could parse emailed oops and bug reports and add the
appropriate cc's there too.  Harder.)
