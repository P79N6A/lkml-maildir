Firmware is usually more clearly separated (the problem ultimately is
that "derived work" is a legal not a technical distinction).

Yes. I don't think the current situation is neccessarily correct, but if
it uses EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL then the "now taint me" ought to fail and the
driver ought to refuse to load a non GPL windows driver.
