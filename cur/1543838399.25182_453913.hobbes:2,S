Subject: 2.6.18-rc4: freeze with wistron_btns driver

After loading the wistron_btns driver in 2.6.18-rc4 and pressing some buttons
that become enabled by this driver, the kernel suddenly freezes.
The reason seems to be git-commit c7948989f84ee6e9c68cc643f8c6a635eb7a904b.
After reversing this patch everything is running fine, except that there
are again the 'section reference mismath' warnings that have been fixed
by the commit.
