hi ian-
the port stuff has to be addressed at some point, but i don't
think you should wait for it, because it is behind a long queue
of other RPC work (like Kerberos for Linux NFS) that has a
higher priority.  also, there are other patches that partially
address this limitation, and certainly those will be used by
the desparate few who need it now. :^)
IMHO.
