eww.  You need a doctored filesystem.

No, everything was listed.  pagecache, buffercache.  This
was pre buffercache-in-pagecache.  I tried lots of stuff,
including intermingling pagecache and buffercache reads
in strict LBA order, buffercache first, no buffercache at
all.  Nothing really helped.  Fact is, all those files are
sprinkled all over the disk and a short seek is pretty much
as expensive as a long one.
The code's at

it includes a demonstration of the ancient art of reading files
in a kernel module via insmod's standard input :)

Yes, I've looked.  It's nice stuff.  The dependencies are critial.

I was preloading everything.  I certainly avoided the thought of
taking a *copy* of everything and placing it elsewhere on disk.
Scary coherency problems there.
One thing I did do a while back was to set up a new root filesystem
on a new disk via `tar cf - | (cd /newplace ; tar xf -)'.  But before
doing this I nobbled ext2's directory placement algorithm so
subdirectories in the new fs go in the same blockgroup as the parent.
This sped boots up quite a bit.  Probably the pagecache preload
code would work better with that setup.
Still.  Joe tells me (offlist) that his machine is taking
ages just to get to the "starting init" stage.
