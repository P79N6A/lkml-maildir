Having the 'containers' pointer in each task-struct is great from a
non-container res mgmt perspective. It lets you dynamically decide what
is the fundamental unit of res mgmt. 
It could be {T1, T5} tasks/threads of a process, or {T1, T3, T8, T10} tasks of 
a session (for limiting login time per session), or {T1, T2 ..T10, T18, T27} 
tasks of a user etc.
But from a vserver/container pov, this level flexibility (at a -task- level) of 
deciding the unit of res mgmt is IMHO not needed. The
vserver/container/namespace (tsk->nsproxy->some_ns) to which a task 
belongs automatically defines that unit of res mgmt.
