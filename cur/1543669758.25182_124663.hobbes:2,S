Hmmm, AFAICS, sched_getaffinity() and sched_setaffinity() 
allow the calling process to be bound to the nominated CPU(s), but that is not 
the same as giving them exclusive access, is it? In other words, other 
processes which have no particualr affinity needs can presumably still be 
scheduled to run on the same processor. 
I am looking for something more akin to the patch I referred to...or did I miss 
something in the effect of set_cpus_allowed()?
Thanks for the replies, Shaheed
