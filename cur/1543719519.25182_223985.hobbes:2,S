No.  Use of floating point HARDWARE, and/or emulation which emulates
troublesome features such as traps, isn't allowed.  Guess why I posted
in the first place, asking whether a certain combination of techniques
might be feasible.

This unfortunate answer probably does answer my question, thank you.

No kidding.  And if I write my own code to do floating point emulation,
it will be even slower.  But if we do none of the above, then we should
say the result will be even slower because we will wait an infinite amount
of time without getting results.

Right, but is there a way to get a customized libc.a to link with a
module's .o and produce a loadable .o without damaging the rest of the
kernel.  I don't quite know a way.

No kidding, that's why use of floating point HARDWARE is prohibited.

Yes, my searching found a few people saying they had found tricks like
this, but my impression is that it's very unreliable and they didn't
reveal their entire trickery (probably unteachable as mentioned).
I do think it is better to avoid the floating point hardware entirely.

To control a device.

Yes, if we use a real-time Linux and make a daemon cooperate very closely
with the driver.

You might be right, if the device can only be controlled to position itself
in say 1,000 different ways, then we could have lookup tables for 1,000
different intervals of (emulations of) floating-point numbers, that yield
1,000 different values of sin.  Another table for cos, another for log10,
etc.  But I'd still have to write my own emulations for binary operators
such as +, /, etc., since a 1,000*1,000 lookup table would be too big.
