The only benchmarks I have for this were included in my last mail to
linux-mm:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-mm&m=111763597218177&w=2
Are they convincing?  Well, the patch doesn't seem to make the memory
thrashing case much worse ("make -j" kernbench run) which is a good
thing since the VM is trying to reclaim much earlier.
In the same e-mail I mention that there is a fairly good performance
gain in the optimal case, where processes are tied to a single node and
the node's memory is filled with page cache.  With zone reclaim turned
on the "make -j8" kernel build runs in 700 seconds;  735 seconds with
no reclaim.
