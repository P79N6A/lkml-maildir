Hmm, that's a good question :)
From /usr/src/linux/Documentation/serial-console.txt:
"You can specify multiple console= options on the kernel command line.
Output will appear on all of them. The last device will be used when
you open /dev/console. So, for example:
        console=ttyS1,9600 console=tty0
defines that opening /dev/console will get you the current foreground
virtual console, and kernel messages will appear on both the VGA
console and the 2nd serial port (ttyS1 or COM2) at 9600 baud."
It sounds like you can still use your PC keyboard to press alt-sysrq.
