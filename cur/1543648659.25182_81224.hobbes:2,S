That's interesting. Passing a completely opaque value (actually an 
integer) through the system call was exactly what we designed it to do, 
because we saw a design need for pecisely that: so that applications 
with awareness of a specific module can talk to the module.
Could you elaborate on why this is a sign of trouble, design wise?

THAT I would love to hear about. If all we have to do to save 
sys_security is change its signature, that'd be great.

Yes, that will be wonderful. And the LSM team will be pleased to re-work 
the desing when stackable file systems appear and we can take advantage 
of them.
