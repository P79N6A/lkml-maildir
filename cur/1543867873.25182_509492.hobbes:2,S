Looking closer ioapic_renumber_irq does not appear to be an irq
compress thing.  Rather it appears to be a work around for a weird
acpi implementation where gsi 0 - 15 are not the ISA irqs. 
Natalie is my reading of the code there correct?
If so keeping ioapic_renumber_irq makes sense.  Although giving
it a name that suggests it is working around weird implementation
details would be good.
