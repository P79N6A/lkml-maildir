Could you also have a look at my zone counters and event counter 
patchsets? This will split up the page statistics into important 
counters that we use (which are then per zone) and the ones that are
only displayed via proc). It would really help to implement numa 
awareness in the VM if we could have per zone vm counters. The zone 
reclaim patchset would already benefit from it.
