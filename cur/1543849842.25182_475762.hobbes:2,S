Subject: [PATCH 003 of 4] md: Fix up maintenance of ->degraded in multipath.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/23/51

A recent fix which made sure ->degraded was initialised properly
exposed a second bug - ->degraded wasn't been updated when drives
failed or were hot-added.
