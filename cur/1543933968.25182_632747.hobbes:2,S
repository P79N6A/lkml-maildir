Presumably you're talking about an actual ISA bus here.  On those, you 
don't really have a chip select; but you'd expect the latch to happen on 
the rising edge of IOW#, not on an internally generated chip select.
Now, I think there is a specific reason to believe that EGA/VGA (but 
perhaps not CGA/MDA) didn't need these kinds of hacks: the video cards 
of the day was touched, directly, by an interminable number of DOS 
applications.  CGA/MDA generally *were not*, due to the unsynchronized 
memory of the original versions (writing could cause snow), so most 
applications tended to fall back to using the BIOS access methods for 
CGA and MDA.
