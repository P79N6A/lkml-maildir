OK, I've been pouring over forcedeth.c and the newly introduce NAPI code,
but didn't debug this yet, so I'll at least lay out the situation so that
somebody else who's more experienced @netdev can pick up from here with
minimal time wastage.
Here's what's happening (repeatedly, reproducibly) on Jurriaan's x64 box:
(1) The following NULL dereference oops:
    nv_rx_process_optimized(), inlined from nv_napi_poll(), found that
    "skb" i.e. np->get_rx_ctx->skb == NULL when trying to update
    skb->ip_summed.
(2) The following BUG in napi_complete():
    BUG_ON(!test_bit(NAPI_STATE_SCHED, &n->state));
    from the nv_napi_poll()->__netif_rx_complete()->napi_complete()
    callchain is triggering. IOW napi_complete() found that a NAPI
    poll wasn't/shouldn't have been scheduled at all (!)
The above two problems appear to be occurring independently, AFAICT.
