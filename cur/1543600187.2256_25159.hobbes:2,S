You have to do the carry-forward on the command line, using 
'make oldconfig'.  It will prompt you to answer any questions that
aren't in the old config file, which will usually be fairly few.  So
it's not that bad, and you only have to do it once per upgrade.
Once you've done it, you can use 'menuconfig' as usual to tune your
configuration.  
BTW, it's quite likely (though I haven't looked at it) that the
VM tunables are in /proc rather than being config options.
