	Naw....we have lots of options.  The first and best 1) A gram of
prevention is worth a kilogram of cure.  If the developer or user knows that
a given program uses alot of stack space, then an option in 'ld' to specify
size of stack to commit, or 2) User says "runprog -stacksize=1M <programname>"
or some such option -- and 1M of stack space is committed/reserved before
when loading the program.  3) We use a signal -- I sorta like overuse of
SIGSTKFLT, but there may be reasons not to use it.  If in default, program
dies as from a SEGV, and 4) if ignored, program is put to sleep waiting on 
free pages.
	Ok, maybe that wasn't lots, but it was at least 4!  :-)
	Not to sound repetitious, but why is lack of memory (a resource as
David puts it) so different from #processes, #open files/system /process, 
out of diskspace on a write call, unable to acquire a 'lock' resource...
	Those just return error's or 'sleep'.  Why should we come up with
a new paradigm for memory?
