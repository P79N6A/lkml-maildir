I have gotten a bit of help from Mylex Tech support.  Jo suggested
that I try updating the card BIOS to the latest version 1.41i.  I
have done that, and while I still get a couple of errors of the same
type (stuck in the state BUS_FREE ) when I first start up, if I get
past that (by mounting and unmounting a CD in my CDRW drive several
times), it seems to work fine.  I am currently burning a CD, and I 
have seen no errors through 95%, while last night, I got errors and
an aborted operation in the first 1% (with the change I made to the
driver to reset the card when it detected a stuck interrupt).
I think I will try adding delays  where Leonard suggested, and see
if it takes the problem away completely.  
I guess I would suggest upgrading to the latest BIOS version to
see if it helps.  I had thought of doing this before, but didn't
do it.  I figured that since there was no real processor on the
board, changing the bios wouldn't help.  Perhaps, I just got lucky
when I booted this time, or perhaps changing the BIOS really did
help.  I had 1.41d BIOS before.
Anyway, it is nice not to have to wait for my root partition to be
checked every time the SCSI card has a problem.
