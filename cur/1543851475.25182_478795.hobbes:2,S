David Rientjes persuaded me that writing our own file system is
reimplementing the existing thing. If we've agreed with file system
interface then configfs may be used. But the limitations I've
pointed out must be discussed.
Let me remind:
1. limitation of size of data written out of configfs;
2. when configfs is a module user won't be able to
   use beancounters.
and one new
3. now in beancounters we have /proc/user_beancounters
   file that shows the complete statistics on BC. This
   includes all then beancounters in the system with all
   resources' held/maxheld/failcounters/etc. This is very
   handy and "vividly": a simple 'cat' shows you all you
   need. With configfs we lack this very handy feature.

I propose not to have the list of tasks associated with beancounter
(what for?) but to extend /proc/<pid>/status with 'bcid: <id>' field.
/configfs/beancounters/<id>/(tasks|threads) file should be write-only
then.
What do you think?
