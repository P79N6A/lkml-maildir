The code does not appear to match the intent for slab redzoning sizing.
It wants to ignore size increases when order 0 allocations are involved,
and otherwise to allow the size increase except when it would make the
size cross a power of 2 boundary.
This actually came under scrutiny during a discussion of fls() usage,
but there appears to be little that can be done there.
The following patch attempts to correct this variation of code from
intent and to document the intent in more detail. Untested.
One thing that could happen is to change or clarify what's trying to
be done to be something other than what I've arranged this to do. The
important point is that the current code doesn't match the intent.
