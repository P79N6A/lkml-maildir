hey guys,
I have been reading through TCP/IP Illustrated Vol 2 and the linux 
source.  I am having a heck of a time finding where it sees a SYN packet 
and check to see if the desitination port is open.  In the book it looks 
like it happens in tcp_input where it looks for the PCB for a segment.  
Any pointers would be greatly appeciated.
Mike
