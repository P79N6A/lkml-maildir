Sorry I should have have explained the mess.

Here goes:
The on the first boot of rc4-mm1 the last line on the screen was about
starting ALSA, so I assumed that was what broke and sent the diff of 
the 'boot.msg' (SuSE 9.1) with and without pci=routeirq.
Then I compiled the intel8x0 driver into the kernel send the resulting
boot.msg with pci=routeirq. Thereafter I hooked up a serial console and 
found an oops from the 'wondershaper' and other unrelated breakage. 
Returning to my original .config and moving the shaper to a later
position in the boot process everything just worked even without
pci=routeirq. That is the last trace I sent.

Yes, startmode is manual and it works:
