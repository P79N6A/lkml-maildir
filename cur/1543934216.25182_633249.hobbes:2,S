- You can get the initial MAC address right after bootup before anyone
  changes it.
- Some (if not many if not all) of the drivers output it on
  driver initialization time so you could read it from `dmesg` or
  some /var/log/messages or .....
There is no "get initial MAC address" ioctl (but it's not that
complicated to implement it).
