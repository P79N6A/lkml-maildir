Can you download and run via-audio-diag as described in the
documentation?  That will provide me with excellent debugging info. 
Also, define VIA_DEBUG at the top of the code, try to play something,
and let me know what the output in your kernel log (or from
/usr/bin/dmesg) says...
via-audio-diag is available in the via82cxxx_audio tarball posted at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/gkernel/

You are definitely using the correct driver.  es13xx or whatever driver
won't work for this chipset.
