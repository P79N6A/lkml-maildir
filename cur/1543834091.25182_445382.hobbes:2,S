Hi Jiri,
Just back from a small holiday, but:

Why the pci_dev_put's? We aren't registering the PCI devices. See
the comment above the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE:
/*
 * Data for PCI driver interface
 *
 * This data only exists for exporting the supported
 * PCI ids via MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE.  We do not actually
 * register a pci_driver, because someone else might one day
 * want to register another driver on the same PCI id.
 */
Since the I/O controller Hub has several functions we explicitely
do not register the PCI device...
PS: In the -mm tree there is allready a replacement for this driver...
Plan is to get this one into linus tree soon.
Greetings,
Wim.
