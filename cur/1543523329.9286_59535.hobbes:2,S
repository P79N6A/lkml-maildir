Yep.  I wasn't sure the other day, but now that I have another
keyboard that SYSRQ does work with I have something to compare it
with.  ;o)

Yes, it is odd indeed, but a desireable thing for such a feature.

Hmm, that sounds like a very good start!  I have a couple

Correct.  I like this approach too.  I'm going to try and
implement it today.  If I do, I'll send my submission to Martin

We could claim that the linux kernel also contains
"accessibility" features for Linux kernel hackers that are
disabled.
;o)
I'm going to get hacking now!  Thanks for your very good idea and
input into the situation!  I'll keep you informed of how I make
