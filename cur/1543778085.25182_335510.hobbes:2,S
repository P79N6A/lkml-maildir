You can do some cleanup that way, but not everything, and then if
people continue to write in their own FunkyStyle locally but what's in
the kernel has been beautified they are going to have a hell of a time
creating proper patches...   It should just be cleaned up by whoever
submits it before it gets merged (and if you want to let a tool help
you out some of the way, then noone's stopping you).
