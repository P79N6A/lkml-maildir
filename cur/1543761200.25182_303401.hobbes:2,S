The jbd_lock_bh_journal_head can be one global lock without a problem. But
when I made jbd_lock_bh_state a global lock, I believe it deadlocked on
me.  So this one has to go into the buffer head.  What do you mean with
"put them in the journal", do you mean the journal_s structure? Is there a
safe way to get to that structure from the buffer head?  The state lock is
used quite a bit and it gets tricky trying to figure out how to use other
structures wrt buffer_heads at all the locations that use
jbd_lock_bh_state.
