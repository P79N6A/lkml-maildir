My i ask what the sense is to not remove the dead code if
 all we are trying to do is stablize the 2.4x kernel series
 and not add extra code or change around the drivers for
 perticular hardware. The code is not used anymore so why
 keep it in the 2.4x series. The code can stay in the 2.5x
 series no problem because there we can change drivers
 rewrite hardware protocalls and tthings like that.

Please -do not- apply this patch.  This "dead code" exists
 for comment purposes, and also is a placeholder for
 future, better support for this chip.
