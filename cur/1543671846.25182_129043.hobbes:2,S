Have the Blackdown folks fix that. The Solaris Threads implementation
suppresses the actual call to a yield in the HotSpot VM if it gets too
many of them bunched together in short period of time. It's really a problem
not with the JVM itself, but the Linux implementaion of their threading
glue logic... Make'm fix it. :)
I've heard that a number of folks in Blackdown want to try out the new
threading model, so this might be a good opportunity to do that... add
special thread suspension support, etc...
:)
