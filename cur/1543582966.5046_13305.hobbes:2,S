It's just an artifact of the fact that processes in state D
(uninterruptible sleep) are included in the load average calculation.
Since the loop thread apparently sits in state D waiting for events
on its device, you get a load average of 1 for each mounted loop
device. 
I know nothing about the implementation of the loop thread so won't
presume to say whether/how it can be "fixed".
