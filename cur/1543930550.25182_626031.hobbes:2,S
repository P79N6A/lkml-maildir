Yes, well, we -do- need to remove the pcibios_resource_to_bus() things
that were added to the generic code. That commit still needs to be
reverted, it is bogus, as I explained in details. But I agree, the rest
of the generic code is probably the best way to deal with those stupid
fixed resources.

I would still need to clear out the BARs I suppose when switching from
legacy to native mode, so they get re-assigned later.

Ok.

I'm digging the HW that needs that stuff right now so I can experiment
with various approaches and pick up the best one. Thanks.
Cheers,
