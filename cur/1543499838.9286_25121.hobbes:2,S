After this instructive tread and some ours over kernel source/howto
these are my points:
o make cohabitation with other OS safer as possible, getting 
  geometry in the same way for all 4 IDE channel:
> * The only "perfect" way to handle this would be to modify the setup.[cS] code
> * to do BIOS calls Int13h/Fn08h and Int13h/Fn48h to get all of the drive info
> * for us during initialization.  I have the necessary docs -- any takers?  -ml
  It's also possible to check it against a PTBL scan, this give us maximum
  security and some level of warning.
o remove the CHS geometry showed on boot, it's well
  documented in /proc/ide/hd*/geometry , or improve it adding some other
  information like where it come from ( cmdline,cmos,identify... )
o Point for LILO and Large-Disk howto on ide.txt
o At this point I don't know for any benefit of a "nocmosgeom" param
  but if will help, you know.
thanks, luca
