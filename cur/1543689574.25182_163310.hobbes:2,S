Subject: [RFC] NR_CPUS=8 on a 32 cpu box

Andrew, All, 
	So, I found the cause of that memory corruption I mentioned last night.
I was booting on the 16x w/ HT and I hadn't taken note that NR_CPUS now
defaults to 8. Whoops. Ends up there isn't any bounds checking when
bringing up the cpus, thus we overflow bios_cpu_apicid[]. 
Here's a quick patch that checks if num_processors has hit NR_CPUS. 
Seems to fix it for me.
Let me know if you have any comments or suggestions. 
thanks
