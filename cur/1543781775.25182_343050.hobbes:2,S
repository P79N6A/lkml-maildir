hi,
what do you mean 8MB? RAM or storage space? what do you intend to acomplish 
with such project?
I've been working on something simillar. I've been able to create a micro 
distro which runs from a floppy disk (kernel+initrd.gz+bootloader<=1.44MB) 
and boots well with as low as 5MB of RAM (tested with qemu). The kernel I've 
used was 2.6.9, but 2.6.12 should work as well.

2.6 has serious advantage over others when considering embedded environments 
(not sure if it applies to you)

I did use uClibc and busybox (crosso compiled and linked to uClibc) to keep 
the distro as small as possible. (see buildroot from the maker of uClibc and 
busybox)
