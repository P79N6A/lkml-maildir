Jeff, the kernel image is already pretty large. if you try and take what
are basicly independant kernel images and put them in one file you will
very quickly endup with something that is to large to use.
As an example a kenel for a boot floppy needs to be <1.4MB compressed,
it's not uncommon for it to be >800K compressed as it is, how do you fit
even two of these on a disk.
remember it's not just the start of the file that varies based on cachline
size, it's the positioning of code and data thoughout the kernel image.
