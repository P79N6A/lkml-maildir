The kernel has async block device and file IO support already --- it
uses that sort of thing for file readahead, for example.  There isn't
an exported async IO api for user applications yet, although we're
working on one.  Kernel internal modules such as TUX can access the
async properties of the page cache if they want to.
Cheers, 
 Stephen
