Hi:
I haven't actually played with it, but the 'MM Shared Memory Library' at
http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mm/
 looks like a starting point.
According to the manual:
 "The MM library is a 2-layer abstraction library which simplifies the
  usage of shared memory between forked (and this way strongly related)
  processes under Unix platforms. On the first layer it hides all platform
  dependent implementation details (allocation and locking) when dealing
  with shared memory segments and on the second layer it provides a
  high-level malloc(3)-style API for a convenient and well known way to
  work with data-structures inside those shared memory segments."
BSD-style license and all that good stuff.
Regards,
- Dave
