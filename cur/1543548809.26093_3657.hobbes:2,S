It's a kernel problem. The 2.2.16 pc_keyb does know about a reconnect
scancode and handles it accordingly. However, on Synaptics touchpad, those
bits are used for a dfifferent kind of information, so the kernel breaks the
support. Unfortunately, a real fix is not easy, as the only way would be to
teach the kernel more about the protocol of PS/2 devices such as the
Synaptics. 
A small patch to comment out the RECONNECT support can be found on my Linux
on Laptops page
