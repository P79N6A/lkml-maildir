I just bought a Logitech Cordless MX Duo (the mouse is MX 700).  In
2.6.0-test9, the small button above the wheel (that repeats one of the
wheel buttons while it is held down) does not work properly.  Just before
repeating, a thumb-button press is read by X and then once again after the
button is released.  This functionality worked until 2.6.0-test6.  I
tracked the problem down to the attached patch, which must be applied in
reverse to 2.6.0-test9 for correct MX 700 functionality.  The mouse
(reciever) is connected via USB.  The mouse works correctly in all cases
when it is connected via the PS/2 port.
As a side note, while I was experiencing the problem in 2.6.0-test9, the
very bottom small button beneath the wheel delivered signals to X as if it
were button-1.	After reverting 2.6.0-test9 with the attached patch (and in
2.6.0-test5), the lowest small button stopped giving any response.
