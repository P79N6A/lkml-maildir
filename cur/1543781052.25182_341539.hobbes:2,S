I don't think that's true.

Acessing vmalloc in /dev/mem would be pretty awkward. Yes it doesn't
also work in mmap of /dev/kmem, but at least in read/write.
There are quite a lot of scripts that use it for kernel debugging
like dumping variables. And for that you really want to access modules
and vmalloc. And it's much easier to parse than /proc/kcore
In fact I have some patches queued to fix it for x86-64 again
(people who used such scripts on i386 are complaining)
