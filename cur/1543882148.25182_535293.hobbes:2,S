Plus one that has been reported since my last list.

Two of them are heavily discussed patches, and I'm therefore not sure 
they will ever reach the 2.6.21 branch now that the attention has been 
shifted away from 2.6.21 regressions.

You are overinterpreting the Handled-By field in my reports.
It does not imply that this person promised to fix this issue, it only 
says that this person is or was working on this issue.
And more than 50% of the issues were reported first last month or 
earlier and are still unfixed despite repeated reminder emails - if
they weren't fixed until now they might as well become similar to
"foo seems to be broken since at about 2.6.9" issues.
It sounds highly unrealistic that all issues unfixed for a month 
suddenly become fixed even though the main focus of everyone shifts to 
2.6.21.

That's a wrong impression, nearly every active kernel developer has at 
least one patch pending for 2.6.22.
