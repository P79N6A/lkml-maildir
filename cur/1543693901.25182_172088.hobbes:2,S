I'm unable to mount cdrom on my system when using ide-scsi. Using 
ide-cdrom works fine. I first saw this problem on 2.4.21. I'm using 
2.4.22, tested 2.4.23-pre7 and the problem exist yet. This is a short 
description of the system:
asus A7V8X-X mobo
LG CD-ROM CRD-8400B (rev. 1.08)
kernel 2.4.22 on Debian Woody
These are the error messages took from kernel log:
]
ide-scsi: expected 2048 got 4096 limit 2048
ide-scsi: The scsi wants to send us more data than expected - discarding 
data
ide-scsi: [[ 28 0 0 0 0 5f 0 0 1 0 0 0 ]
]
ide-scsi: expected 2048 got 4096 limit 2048
ide-scsi: The scsi wants to send us more data than expected - discarding 
data
ide-scsi: [[ 28 0 0 0 0 60 0 0 1 0 0 0 ]
]
ide-scsi: expected 2048 got 4096 limit 2048
ide-scsi: The scsi wants to send us more data than expected - discarding 
data
ide-scsi: [[ 28 0 0 0 0 61 0 0 1 0 0 0 ]
]
...  many times, and then:
ide-scsi: expected 2048 got 4096 limit 2048
Unable to identify CD-ROM format.
Can you help?
TIA,
Ivo
