What if, when you obtained said parts, it came with a license which
appeared to be genuine, but in fact was illegally changed in a country
which has not signed up to the copyright treaty?  (I believe this may
be part of the story here.)  I believe that you'd need a good copyright
lawyer, and it may depend upon local law.
