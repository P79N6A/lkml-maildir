Arrgh. Somebody has messed about with the API for readpage and
writepage, so that they no longer pass the file pointer!
This screws up any attempt to cache the RPC credentials at file
opening, since there's no longer any way to pass the credential down
to the read/write.
I'll try to get round to reverting this in the LinuxNFS tree tomorrow...
Cheers,
  Trond
