Maybe RAID0 the three disks ... make 3 partitions of 4GB and make a
12 GB RAID0. You will sum up the speed of all the three disks (not really
sum exactly but you should find a speed around 18 - 20 MB/s on the RAID0
if you sum 7 MB/s for the IDE * 2 + 7 for the SCSI).
That's not bad for a database disk subsystem: 12 GB at 20 MB/s
For security of data you can even make a series of 4 or 5 equally big 
RAID0 partitions and then RAID5 all them up so you gain the speed of RAID0
and the security of RAID5.
Kernel is alredy capable of doing RAID 0/1/4/5.
The improvements on disk performance and/or security are guaranteed.
Ciao,
