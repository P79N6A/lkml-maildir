I planned to post this to netdev first, but then I thought that it's
more a task for the stable team and/or those people who track
regressions, and I don't know if those people track all the subsystem
mailing lists. Especially as there is a patch that fixes the issue for
me, and the corresponding bugzilla entry is alrealy marked as resolved
and "patch available", so it seems to me as it is just a matter of
incorporating an existing patch into further revisions of 2.6.24.
