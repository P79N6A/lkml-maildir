Why not?  The things that haven't been ported over yet
obviously are unmaintained.  If we can make the few
remaining board ports in there utterly broken, we
can finally remove arch/ppc/ completely :-)
Since nothing new gets added to arch/ppc/ anymore,
anyone who wants it can get it from an older kernel
tree, no?
[Yes, I'm half joking.  No, not fully.]
