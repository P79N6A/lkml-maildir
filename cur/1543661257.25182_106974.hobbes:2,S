Hi!
I had compactflash from Apacer (256MB), and it started corrupting data
in few months, eventually becoming useless and being given back for
repair. They gave me another one and it is just starting to corrupt
data.
First time I repartitioned it; now I only did mke2fs, and data
corruption can be seen by something as simple as
cat /mnt/cf/mp3/* > /mnt/cf/delme; md5sum /mnt/cf/delme.
[Fails 1 in 5 tries].
Anyone seen something similar? Are there some known-good
compactflash-es?
