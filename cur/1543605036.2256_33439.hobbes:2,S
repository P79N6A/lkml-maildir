I was expecting a more serious bug-fix. I recently upgraded my kernel from 
2.4.11pre1 to 2.4.13-pre2aa1. Now anacron "kill"s the machine every morning 
by starting updatedb. Basicly everything swaps out. If I don't touch the 
mouse for 3 seconds, it will take 15 seconds to respond next time I touch it. 
Switching between desktops in KDE, takes from 3 to 10 minutes, and updatedb 
never seems to complete, I have had to kill it manually every time so far. I 
had similar problems every morning with 2.4.9 although not as bad, but I 
havent seen them before in 2.4.10 and later.
The problem is easily replicable, I just need to run updatedb. Would you like 
some statistics and which?
regards
`Allan
