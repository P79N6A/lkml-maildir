We discussed that last time, and I think it was Roger who proposed a patch
to ifconfig so that it would send an ARP request first and complain if the
IP you're trying to set is already used.
We're  left with  the  question as  to whether  ifconfig  should by  default
complain but put the  IP anyway, or refuse to put the IP  unless you give it
some --ignore-IP-conflict flag.
That approach is not incompatible with  the kernel patch, and I believe that
both should be implemented.
