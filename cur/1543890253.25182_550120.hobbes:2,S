How can this hunk be correct?  neponset_init() is only called from
subsys_initcall() - it's not something we want to keep at init time.
I'm afraid I suspect faulty section analysis.
Given that (in the other messages) that there's other problems with
the warnings being generated, I'm reluctant to apply this off-hand.
I feel that the patch need quite careful review to make sure that
we're not introducing incorrect stuff such as the above.
I'll try and commit some of these changes this week though.
