Yes. Don't you look at the raw data anyway?
Um, maybe you just don't work the way I do. In response to one
of your other messages, most of the time I have two PowerPC books
open on my desk. I hadn't thought that was so odd.
If you are going to rely on a tool, you might as well add some
error correction bits to the oops, base-32 encode it, and chop
it up into 5-character words for ease of paper-and-pencil copy.

In theory yes, but in practice no. Your kernel isn't a significant
portion of your address space, so the chance of random data being
looked up successfully is very low. Maybe a 1% chance on 32-bit
hardware, and far less on 64-bit hardware.

Damn.
Somebody else posted a reasonable hack for the [<>] problem.
His proposal involved letting multiple values share the same
markers, something like this:
[<c19a5cb4 c180234c c1801134 c1706550 c1800248 c1603310 c1934878 c1840324>]
