I've been wanting to starting hacking at the Linux kernel so when I
finished building an electronics kit I bought (a parallel port connected
device interface board), I decided to have a go at building a Linux driver
for it.  For all the info see:  
http://www.angband.org/~lurker
At this point all I have done is build a basic framework with the 
necessary components to make a modular character device driver that uses 
the parallel port.  At least I THINK thats what i've done.  It's all 
based of of what information I could get out of "Linux Device Drivers" 
(of limited use as it only covers 2.0 and early 2.1 kernels) and looking 
at other parallel port utilizing char device drivers.  So I guess before I 
procede I just want someone to check what I have and tell me if I've got 
the frame work built correctly, then I can get into adding some code to 
actually manipulate the device.
	Thanks for any and all help!,
