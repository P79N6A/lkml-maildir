Hello Developers
Please help me get my head around this.
The newer PCI sound cards like the EMU10K1 use page tables and
a translation lookaside buffer to convert virtual to physical
addresses. I think understand why this is done and the generalities
of how but do not understand the specifics related to the actual
programming. The page table is supposed to be in system memory
and contain the physical address of each 4KB page within virtual memory.
Questions:
(1) How do I create these page tables?
(2) I imagine there are registers controlling the TLB. What usually        
needs to be done in these registers?
(3) Once created, how are these page tables and TLBs used?
(4) Is there anything I can read to get smart on these specific
    problems (besides the source for the EMU10K1 driver)?
Thanks,
Daniel Sheltraw
