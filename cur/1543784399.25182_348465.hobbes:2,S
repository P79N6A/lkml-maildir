| - Many tty drivers still won't compile
indeed ... here one of them:
  CC [M]  drivers/char/speakup/speakup.o
drivers/char/speakup/speakup.c: In function 'speakup_paste_selection':
drivers/char/speakup/speakup.c:491: error: 'struct tty_ldisc' has no member named 'receive_room'
drivers/char/speakup/speakup.c:491: error: 'struct tty_ldisc' has no member named 'receive_room'
make[3]: *** [drivers/char/speakup/speakup.o] Error 1
make[2]: *** [drivers/char/speakup] Error 2
make[1]: *** [drivers/char] Error 2
warnings from compile (gcc 4.0.1) till this error can be found in 
attachement 'build-log-$kernelver-processed'. 
the xfs trouble with '"__BIG_ENDIAN" is not defined' is now happening since rc6-mm1.
config can be found here:
http://cvs.archlinux.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/kernels/kernel26mm/config?rev=1.34&cvsroot=Extra&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup
hope this info is usable to somebody out there,
greetings,
