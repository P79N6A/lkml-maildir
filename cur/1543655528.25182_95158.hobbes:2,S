I found that ffz() to find the index of the not-fully-populated child
node to search was efficient enough to provide a precisely K == 2*levels
constant within the O(1) for accesses in all non-failure cases.
Measuring by cachelines it would have been superior to provide a
cacheline-sized node at each level and perform ffz by hand.

Userspace test harnesses are essential for this kind of work. They
were for several of mine.
