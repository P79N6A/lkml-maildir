You are confused between unicode characters and unicode codepoints.
Every unicode codepoint has exactly one  UTF-8 representation.
Unicode characters may use one ore more unicode codepoints.
Some characters have also representation with one codepoint, but not all.
For example
	LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH ACUTE
have presentation	0041 0301
That is two unicode codepoints.  That character
have also other (compatibility) representation
that is			00C1
But consider (somewhat imaginary) character
	LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH GRAVE AND CIRCUMFLEX
that have presentation	0041 0300 0302
but it have also presentation	0041 0302 0300
Both presentations are equal short.
