Ok, as i can see  [and as Andi guessed 
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4792
] 
issue have been introduced by new TSC sync algorithm
git id: dda50e716dc9451f40eebfb2902c260e4f62cf34.
And, yes, seems like it depends of timings...
In my case kludge with insertion of low delay (e.g. printk) between 
cpu_set/mb and tsc_sync_wait() makes kernel bootable.
