Yes, if your are talking about kernel 2.6.0-testX there are already some 
million reports from people who forgot to include support for virtual
terminal and/or vga text console on their kernels.
If your problem is different, your kernel version another one, and have
more details about your problem just ask, but before do your homework
and search the list archives and Google.
Hope this helps.
