Have you tried Condor?  Condor is a "high throughput computing" package, 
specifically targetted at such applications, with the ability to checkpoint & 
migrate jobs, etc.  Condor is free as in beer, but currently not as in speech 
(sorry), and is developed by the University of Wisconsin.  
http://www.condorproject.org
 is the URL to learn more.  Version 6.4.0 is in 
the process of being released and should be available within the next couple 
of days.
Condor runs on Linux (x86 & Alpha), Solaris, IRIX, HPUX, Digital Unix, and 
NT, although the NT usually lags the Unix releases.
