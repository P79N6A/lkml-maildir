If that is what is going on, there is nothing linux can do about it; 
it's a limitation of the hardware.  The IDE controller can only accept 
one command at a time, so if that command takes a while to complete, the 
other drive on the same channel can not be accessed until the first 
command completes. 
If the system doesn't come back though after sufficient time has gone by 
for the burn to complete, then this is probably not what is happening.  
I'd suggest using magic-sysreq to force an unmount and reboot, then see 
if there's anything in the logs.
