Dunno what means 'f', I use magicfilter and the /etc/printcap generated by
magifilterconfig contains :
lp|escp500|Stylus Color 500:\
        :lp=/dev/lp0:sd=/var/spool/lpd/escp500:\
        :sh:pw#80:pl#72:px#1440:mx#0:\
        :if=/etc/magicfilter/StylusColor-500@720dpi-filter:\
        :af=/var/log/lp-acct:lf=/var/log/lp-errs:

I will try to retrieve the patch and test it.
