Why do you think that?
With cooperative scheduling (like the example Zach posted), there is 
absolutely no "brown and sticky" wrt any CPU usage. Which is why 
cooperative scheduling is a *good* thing. If you want to blow up your 
1024-node CPU cluster, you'd to it with "real threads".
Also, with sane default limits of fibrils per process (say, in the 5-10), 
it also ends up beign good for IO. No "insane" IO bombs, but an easy way 
for users to just just get a reasonable amount of IO parallelism without 
having to use threading (which is hard).
So, best of both worlds.
Yes, *of*course* you want to have limits on outstanding work. And yes, a 
database server would set those limits much higher ("Only a thousand 
outstanding IO requests? Can we raise that to ten thousand, please?") than 
a regular process ("default: 5, and the super-user can raise it for you if 
you're good").
But there really shouldn't be any downsides.
(Of course, there will be downsides. I'm sure there will be. But I don't 
see any really serious and obvious ones).

Since we'd only create fibrils on a system call entry level, and system 
calls are independent, how would you do that anyway?
Once a fibril has been created, it will *never* depend on any other fibril 
resources ever again. At least not in any way that any normal non-fibril 
call wouldn't already do as far as I can see.
