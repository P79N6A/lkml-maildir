Another 7 minutes, and I'll know if this worked or not.
Another data point I just thought of, if i poff chatham, and then pon
chatham, that actually works.
It just hung up.
And redialed.
And connected properly.
Thank you so very much, it looks like your reset-serial did the job.
I'll implement it on future machines, just in case the same problem
happens, rather than pray it works.
I saw a lot of postings on the 5160 USR modem on the serial-pci-info list,
perhaps it's something to do with this modem.
I'll know for sure at 10:30 this evening, if it is definately owrking or
not.  I was logged in on the other line to monitor the syslog, and bring
up the internet line, just in case.
Thanks again,
Mike
