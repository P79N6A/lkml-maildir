Unfortunately, it looks like ugidd went away years ago.  It was also a
security concern, but then again, no more so than nfsd trusting the uid
in the request.
knfsd does not support this.  Your best bet looks like gss/krb5, but I've
never used it. (I prefer to avoid NFS entirely, wherever possible)
