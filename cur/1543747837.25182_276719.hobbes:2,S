I think that this is an _awesome_ idea.  Might want to check out what
overlap there is with existing glibc interfaces.  For example, I presume
that glibc implements at least some of the atomic operations (but I also
think having a full suite of atomic operations available is useful).
Some of the stuff, like semaphores, isn't really going to port very well
to user-space.  At least not directly, I would not think.
But on numerous occasions I have wanted the kernel's barriers, atomic
operations, bitwise operations, or some of the compiler things we
implement (likely, unlikely, fixes) in user-space.

FWIW, you have my permission.  I've touched spinlock.h a bunch.
