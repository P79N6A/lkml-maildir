Not being very used to BK, does that mean I have several trees around:
1. the official release tree
2. an "old tree" with my local change that I'm forwarding
3. a temporary test tree to see if the merge would succeed, which
   I'll get by cloning (1) and then pulling from (2)?
Well, talk about FAAAAAAST drives (10,025/min SCSI kind) unless you have
time to waste on all those BK consistency checks (which are, of course,
what #3 is all about).
Or am I missing some obvious short cut?
