Not that I agree, but I don't think it is the absolute /dev entries that
bother him: it is the fact that knowledge of the mount itself is an
information leak.
Which it is.  As root, in my name space, I should rest in the knowledge
that my mounts are secret, I guess.  But I just do not see it as a big
problem.
