The card supports I/O addresses above 64k, i think. It has a PCMCIA
slot as well on it, allowing access to the same

 It
looks like lot of workarounds in my BIOS to me probably, couldn't
really make out much in there

One of the things that really confused me was, on 2.6.17.7 in lspci it
always shows BIST is running. on 2.6.20, it is not there at all.
If this is a bug in the BIOS, i am wondering how the older revisions
of the same bridge works. The last two devices in that lspci output
are Rev 01 devices
