IFF the 'C' compiler code-generators start making better code, i.e.,
ORing a value already in a register, with itself and jumping on
condition, then bool will be helpful. Right now, I see tests against
numbers (like 0). This increases the code-size because the 0 is
in the instruction stream, plus the comparison of an immediate
value to a register value (on Intel) takes more CPU cycles.
So, if the compiler, knowing that bool can be only TRUE or
FALSE (implementation-defined 1 or 0), then it can probably
save a few CPU cycles. A good thing about a new type is that
you don't have to use it. Just like enumerated types, if you
don't like them, don't use them. Perfectly good code can be
written without them.

    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
