The problem is a philosophical one. I am not willing to expend any 
energy helping to develop code to make Linux better if the end result 
is that it won't be accepted into the Linux kernel.
At the end of the day, maybe one day I will end up doing this, and 
the result may well be a fork of the Linux kernel (since there are a 
lot of people who do agree with what I have to say).
