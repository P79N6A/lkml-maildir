LABEL= is so broken that I immediately remove it from all my redhat
systems. It is not unique at all. As soon as you plug another system
disk into your system at boot time all hell breaks loose. At least it
could have a random number in it or something.
If you need to know your bootdisk (why?) why not just get the bootloader
to tell you?
