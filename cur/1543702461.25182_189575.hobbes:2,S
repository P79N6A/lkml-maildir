Just after having read your message, it bit again. This time there's
also a "bad: scheduling while atomic!" error. I guess it must've been
reported already. I've included a snipped dmesg, just to provide more
context to help trace down the bug.
Also, I misread your "turkey" as a "turnkey" at a first glance ;)
