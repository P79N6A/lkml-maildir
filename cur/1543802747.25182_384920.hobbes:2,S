OK.  I'll look at that.
But I was thinking more about the code that (in the original) handled 
the case where the number of tasks to be moved was less than 1 but more 
than 0 (i.e. the cases where "imbalance" would have been reduced to zero 
when divided by SCHED_LOAD_SCALE).  I think that I got that part wrong 
and you can end up with a bias load to be moved which is less than any 
of the bias_prio values for any queued tasks (in circumstances where the 
original code would have rounded up to 1 and caused a move).  I think 
that the way to handle this problem is to replace 1 with "average bias 
prio" within that logic.  This would guarantee at least one task with a 
bias_prio small enough to be moved.
I think that this analysis is a strong argument for my original patch 
being the cause of the problem so I'll go ahead and generate a fix. 
I'll try to have a patch available later this morning.
Peter
