Subject: 2.6.23.9, make install doesn't work with grub anymore??

Hello,
I downloaded the vanilla kernels 2.6.23.8 and 2.6.23.9 from kernel.org.  I unpacked them like I have every other kernel release.  I compiled the kernel successfully, did the make modules and make modules_install with no problems.  When I did the make install I am told it Cannot find LILO.  The message seems to come from /usr/src/linux-2.6.23.9/arch/i386/boot/install.sh
The script is correct that I don't have lilo installed, I have used grub for quite some time.  I don't remember having this problem with older kernels, sorry I don't remember one of the top of head.  Did something change or is:
cp .config /usr/src/linux-2.6.23-9
make menuconfig
make
make modules
make modules_install
make install
no longer adequate to compile and install a kernel?
Thanks,
Scott
