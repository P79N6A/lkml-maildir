The only reported _SUN problems on Dell systems were on the PE6800 and
PE6850 systems, which we've fixed with an updated BIOS several months
ago.  IIRC the values weren't always unique which kind of defeated the
purpose.
The eth0/eth1 "issues" are completely separate, with no relation to
ACPI.  That's purely a PCI tree depth-first discovery
vs. breadth-first discovery (where it indeed seems everyone except
Linux 2.6 uses and expects breadth-first).  We looked at extending
ACPI to export device naming preference, but instead extended SMBIOS
tables because we could get that change in far easier.
The other bit that looks at slot numbers is the old PCI IRQ Routing
Table, which still exists on Dell systems.

Again, I've only seen this be incorrect on those two models of Dell
servers with outdated BIOS versions.
