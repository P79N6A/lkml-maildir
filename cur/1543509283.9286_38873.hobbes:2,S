I have some pending patch for 2.3.x and as I am running 2.3.x I am forced
to take these patches in sync until they will be merged in order to run
them on my machine. Instead of making a new big andrea-patch as I did in
the past, now I am going to take all patches sparated. This way is really
ugly for running controlversial patches since if two of my patches will be
controversial I'll have to maintain two version of one of the two patches:
one plain against the official kernel always ready for kernel inclusion
and another secondary patch that will apply clean on the top of my kernel
tree. But this is the only way since taking everything into a CVS
repository reduce to zero the time to merge a new kernel reveision, but it
make too much hard to cleanly extract the single patches leather.
Since I'll do this patch-work for me I believe it's a good idea to make it
public so everybody can test my stuff without having to apply eventually
controversial patches by hand from linux-kernel etc...
So basically now there is a directory here:
	
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/andrea/kernel-patches/my-2.3.18ac3/
	
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/andrea/kernel-patches/my-2.3.18ac3/
In such directory there are separate patches to apply in alphabetical
order. something like this will do the trick:
	tar xzf linux-2.3.18.tar.gz
	cd linux
	bzip2 -cd ../patch-2.3.18ac3.bz2 | patch -p1
	for i in ../my-2.3.18ac3/*; do patch -p1 < $i; done
(you need bash as shell of course)
where ../my-2.3.18ac3 is the directory which contains all my patches.
Actually there is:
chksum-2		fix checksum buffer overflow if buf&1 != 0
inode-dynamic-3		allow an huge number of inodes to live in the icache
		 	and avoid to leak memory (since it will be shrunk as
		 	soon as the memory goes low). Also save memory since
		 	only valid (caching) inodes will live in memory.
kupdate-1		kupdate daemon replacement for update
			(improvement and more robust)
munmap-lock-1		munmap should grab the big kernel lock as the vma list
	      		is still protected by the big kernel lock
oom-2.3.17-1		OOM fixes, also avoid X to be killed with SIGKILL
oops-1			fixes in the Oops code to dump the right information
			careless of where the module is loaded in the
			vmalloced area page-io-fail-unlock-1: unlock the
			page if rw_swap_page_base fails 
probe-irq-2.3.14-pre2-1 avoid a pending irq to be mistaken for a
			spurious irq
ramdisk-2		fixes the page-cache to allow the ramdisk to work
			correctly on the 2.2.x kernels
shm-lock-2.3.17-5	SMP-thread the shm memory. This is been developed by
		   	boyard.jean-luc <jean-luc.boyard@siemens.fr> at
		   	Siemens
show-buffers-1		printk the buffer information in SYSRQ+M
swap-free-2		swap_free needs the big kernel lock in
			delete_from_swap_cache
touch-buffer		touch the buffer at find_buffer and not a brelse time
