No matter whether slub/slab is selected someone gets a page and moves/adds its
.lru head to some list after being in the deffered_pages list yet -- this breaks
the deffered_pages list and loops forever in list_for_each (unless LIST_DEBUG is
selected, which produces a BUG).
Any ideas who could be the one pushing the page to some other list?
