One problem here is that MII depends on NET_ETHERNET, which is
10/100 ethernet, which may not be enabled if someone has only
gigabit ethernet.  :)
I have a partial patch which moves MII and PHYLIB outside of
NET_ETHERNET.  That also makes them usable by USB or other
non-drivers/net/ drivers, e.g., again without the need
to enable NET_ETHERNET if someone only has USB ethernet.  :(
I'll try to post it for review later today.
