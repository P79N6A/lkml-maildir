I think the best ways is to listen to hotplug events in some fashion.
Raw netlink, D-Bus, etc.

Exactly. Any driver working through evdev interface should examine
device's capabilities and decide whether it is interested in the
device or not.

/sys/class/input/event0/device pointe to corrseponding input device
and you can get capabilities from there.
/sys/class/input/event0/dev contains dev_t so if you don't see proper/
/dev/input/eevent* you can create your own.

Speaker is tied very closely to keyboard beeps and that's why it is
part of input system.

There are keys that are tied in firmware to the video device that
switch between CRT and LCD on laptops. They emit events like
KEY_SWITCHVIDEOMODE and so input device was needed.
