http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/old-2.6-bkcvs.git;a=commit;h=294c42046966e927ef86c0d4ce71cff32d9b458c
Yes, it certainly was removed there.  Thanks for finding the commit.  That 
had gone past me unnoticed.
This means we are now back to the old behaviour where fs utilities will 
behave randomly/unpredictably depending on what fs was mounted (or even 
was tried to be mounted!) on the device last.  So for example a failing 
"mount -t auto" will leave the block size set to a random number when all 
fs utilities (at least used to) asume the block size is 1k and strangeness 
ensues.
I have no idea why Jeff (Mahoney) considered the setting to be 
unnecessary, when Al Viro added the resetting code a few years ago it 
was done precisely because utilities were behaving randomly/erratically...
IMHO the above commit consitutes a regression in 2.6 kernel.
Best regards,
	Anton
