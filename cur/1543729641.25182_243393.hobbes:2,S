>> There is already. cdrecord on SuSE 9.1 tells you:
>> Cdrecord-Clone-dvd 2.01a27 (i686-suse-linux) Copyright (C) 1995-2004 J??rg Schilling
>> Note: This version is an unofficial (modified) version with DVD support
>> Note: and therefore may have bugs that are not present in the original.
>> Note: Please send bug reports or support requests to

>> Note: The author of cdrecord should not be bothered with problems in this version.
>So, case closed, it seems. Any other arguments, Joerg?
