Inlines don't always help performance (depending on cache sizes, branch 
penalties, frequency of code access...), but they do always increase 
code size.
I believe the point Alan was trying to make is not that we should have 
more or less inlines, but we should have smarter inlines. I.E. don't 
just inline a function to "make it fast"; think about the implications 
(and ideally measure it, though I think that becomes problematic when 
so many other factors can affect the benefit of a single inlined 
function). The specific example he gave was inlining code on the fast 
path, while accepting branch/cache penalties for non-inlined code on 
the slow path.
