Could you please precise what is corrupted? The guest disk image?
If that's the case, I experienced the same problem since
kvm-userspace.git has been updated to the latest qemu CVS, and I can
reproduce it with plain QEMU. I am able to reproduce it easily by
booting FreeBSD.
The problem is actually in QEMU, it has been broken by this commit:
http://cvs.savannah.nongnu.org/viewvc/qemu/hw/ide.c?root=qemu&r1=1.64&r2=1.65
You can try to apply the attached patch, it reverts this commit and can
be applied to the latest QEMU CVS and to the latest KVM versions.
