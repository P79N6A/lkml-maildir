Version 0.0.6 of yaird is now available at:
	
http://www.xs4all.nl/~ekonijn/yaird/yaird-0.0.6.tar.gz
Yaird is a proof of concept perl rewrite of mkinitrd.  It aims to
reliably identify the necessary modules by using the same algorithms
as hotplug, and comes with a template system to to tune the tool for
different distributions and experiment with different image layouts.
It requires a 2.6 kernel with hotplug.  There is a paper discussing it at:

Summary of user visible changes for version 0.0.6
     * Support cryptsetup.  See the README file, see HTML documentation.
     * Support aliases and options in modprobe.conf,
       simply by using modprobe rather than doing a reimplementation in perl.
     * tested with ulibc
     * Bugfixes:
       - failure to generate image on systems without LVM
       - overcrowded /dev under Debian with udev
       - failure to generate image if multiple links to same raid device exist
       - uninitialised value in verbose output
On top of the todo list are now:
     * support NFS devices
     * support cryptsetup-luks
     * support loopback devices
Regards,
Erik
