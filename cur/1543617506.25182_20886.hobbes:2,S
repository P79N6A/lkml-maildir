Looking up "good hash function" on Google leads to these notable pages:
http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/doobs.html
	A Hash Function For Hash Table Lookup - Robert Jenkins
http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/
	Hash Functions and Block Ciphers - Robert Jenkins
http://www.concentric.net/~Ttwang/tech/inthash.htm
	Integer Hash Function - Thomas Wang
The last one is interesting because it mentions the golden prime
multiplier function, and suggests good non-multipler functions instead.
(Justification: the multiplier function doesn't distribute bits evenly).
enjoy,
