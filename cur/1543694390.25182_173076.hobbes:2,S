I have seen similar behaviour with flash readers. I have CF and memstick
readers, and after a photo session I'm likely to have a bunch of each to
unload. If I do the CF first, the device is sda. Even changing media,
still sda. But when I unplug and connect the memstick reader, that
becomes sdb, and sda is shown as missing in action.
I didn't report it because I lack time to characterize it properly and I
can live with it. But since you report the problem, I'll throw this info
out in case it helps someone else understand exactly what's happening.
I *believe* I first saw it in test4, I haven't been running 2.6 kernels
lately on that machine, so I can't say if it's still an issue.
