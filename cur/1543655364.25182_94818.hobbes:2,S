Unless I somehow have a bad tree (which I will verify in a moment), this
does not seem to compile at all.

Why blow away at a partition when you can chip away at it?  I now
present a script I just wrote that writes random bits of, well random
bits, into random places in your favorite partition or file.  For best
(meaning most spectacular) results, use while the database or
filesystem is in active use.
Disclaimer:  This code is untested, and it may or may not trash your
filesystem and/or database.  While at least a half-assed effort has
been made to ensure that it works as designed, there is no guarantee
that its use will result in a loss of important data.  I am not liable
for the lack of either direct or incidental damages.
