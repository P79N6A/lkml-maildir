Hi,
While looking at something else, got drifted to looking into
initcall<n>.init. I found two instance of pci_acpi_init() function,
one in drivers/pci/pci-acpi.c and another in i386/pci/acpi.c.
I understand this doesnot cause any problem since they are static, but
someone new looking at the code could fall for it? Is it worth
changing one of its name or should I just go away :)
Muthu.
