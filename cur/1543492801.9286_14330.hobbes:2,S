I would strongly encourage driver writers who use __put_user()
to write comments justifying the use of __put_user() and where/how
access_ok() is called.  There are still several drivers (as of 2.2.1)
that call __put_user() without protection, and more drivers where
it takes a non-trivial amount of time to determine that they are
actually safe, with little performance benefit.  Since an unprotected
__put_user() can be a direct security hole, it is quite important.
