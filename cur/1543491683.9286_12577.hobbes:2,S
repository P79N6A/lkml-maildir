The following test program illustrates that when many threads do
non-overlapping read's and write's to a shared file using mmap(), the
data read does not match the data written.
It seems that if you use mmap(),memcpy(),munmap() to read/write to a
portion of a file, you can get corrupt data. There appears to be no
thread-safe alternative besides this method to do offset-thread-safe
reads and writes on Linux.
We are using RedHat's kernel 2.0.36-3, and glibc 2.0.7-29.
Does this program work on the "2.2" kernels?
This program makes it appear that mmap() is really broken in 2.0.36.

Contents: mmap() Bug Illustration
Created:  1-Apr-1999
Compile as:
    g++ -D_REENTRANT -Wall -Werror -g -o writerTestLinux writerTestLinux.C -lpthread
Description:
    This program spawns 10 threads that write and then read data from
a file using mmap() [mostly because pread/pwrite don't exist on
Linux]. The program shows that although the data being written and
read do not overlap, the data becomes corrupt.
Operation:
	
    We create a large file filled with 'x's
    We create 10 threads. Each with a "letter" (a,b,c etc.) to write into the
	file.
    Each thread, reserves a 500 byte chunk of the file by locking the
	globalOffset variable, incrementing it by 500, and unlocking
    Now that the "chunk" is reserved, the thread write's and read's
	its "letter" to the reserved region of the file.
    It compares what it read to what it wrote and dies if they don't match.
Theory/Guess:
    Because we don't have pread/pwrite, we have to use mmap(). mmap() requires
page alignment on the "offset" parameter. This causes us to mmap() a region
larger than what we are writing/reading. Although we don't TOUCH those extra
bits, perhaps there is a bug/race-condition involving overlapping mmap()'s 
that causes the data to become corrupt.
