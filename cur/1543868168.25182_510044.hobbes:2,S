yes and seems to be always the same:
with new burned cd I got:
# ll /MultiCd/cd060213.iso
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 3213312 Feb 13  2006 /MultiCd/cd060213.iso
i.e. 3213312/2048 == 1569
while:
readcd dev=/dev/hdd f=- | md5sum
Read  speed:  1059 kB/s (CD   6x, DVD  0x).
Write speed:   353 kB/s (CD   2x, DVD  0x).
Capacity: 1571 Blocks = 3142 kBytes = 3 MBytes = 3 prMB
Sectorsize: 2048 Bytes
Copy from SCSI (1,1,0) disk to file '-'
end:      1571
Errno: 0 (Success), read_g1 scsi sendcmd: no error
CDB:  28 00 00 00 06 00 00 00 23 00

Sense Bytes:

cmd finished after 0.014s timeout 40s
readcd: Success. Cannot read source disk
readcd: Retrying from sector 1536.
so always Capacity == original image size + 2 ?

btw this tips:
readcd dev=/dev/hdd sectors=0-1569 f=- | md5sum
Read  speed:  1059 kB/s (CD   6x, DVD  0x).
Write speed:   353 kB/s (CD   2x, DVD  0x).

(adding sectors=0-1569 : 1569 being the size of the original image)
seems to work fine
# md5sum /MultiCd/cd060213.iso
6a1248783a21722816b972aa9bae9d5e  /MultiCd/cd060213.iso

I would be curious to read same cd on scsi cdrom (at the office)?
