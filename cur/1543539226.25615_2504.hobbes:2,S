This sounds very very close to FFS+softupdates on FreeBSD boxes where there
is DAG representation of write-orderings and dependencies of various metadata
chunks. The orderings can be delayed to reduced the number of explict disk writes,
etc... just like FSes mounted as async and has similar performance to it and
journaled FSes too. But it maintains FS consistency at all times.
It's very close to what I expect from a journaled FS.
