I'd hope that they were not that many events that it would ever be
costly.
But this should be mitigated by your event aggregator in user-space,
whether that is D-BUS or whatever else.  If it is D-BUS, you could then
subscribe via D-BUS only to the events you care about.

Whatever you want to do.
I think they way we would set up our Linux desktop product would have D-
BUS listening on the kevent socket and propagating the events up the
stack (or have a separate daemon listen and funnel the events to D-BUS.
whatever).
Then applications up the stack would respond to and handle the D-BUS
signals.
