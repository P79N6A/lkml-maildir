Do you have any inklings as to why they'd have gone this way ?

Hmmm.  I can't claim to have any better exposure than yourself, I was
asking more from a consumer point of view.
My perspective on LWP's is from a Solaris background so your comments are
very interesting, indeed, given the respect the Solaris model has earned.
I think the differences I see aren't so much technical as the way they're
interacted with (and perceived by someone who's been around Unix too long).
For example, I'd expect a ps (or ls in /proc) to list LWP's as separate
processes (I assume), when it ought not to.  The impression of different
pid's is of different processes, which the clone model breaks.
Cheers,
Darren
p.s. one person I've spoken to claimed that the Linux clone implementation
breaks some aspect of signal handling/delivery but that may just as well be
rhumour.
