Hello
I've just started having a java application bomb out not long into 
running as well where previously it would run for hours without 
problems. However, unlike  yourselves I'm running -ck and the only 
change between the last working -ck and this kernel are the 3 security 
patches. I haven't investigated because I cant take the machine offline, 
but I suspect it's one of those possibly interfering. Looking at the 
patches in question I have no idea how they could do it. I guess if you 
can try backing them out it would be helpful. Here are links to the 
patches in question.
