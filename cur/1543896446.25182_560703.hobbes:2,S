If a process uses read() it needs some executable and writable memory. We do
check for this in mprotect(). There is a problem with the i386-architecture,
because it allows execution of any readable page (except with newer
processors). But beyond that ugliness of i386, it should not be possible to
execute anything without us noticing it (hopefully).
Scripting languages are of course problematic. In the suid-case you could just
call anyone insane who wants to use a suid-shellscript. But in other cases one
might want signed binaries for, we do have a problem. With java or shell one
would need an interpreter/vm which is signed and reasonably trustworthy itself
and checks the signature of the shellscript or classfile it executes.  The
(probably not all too complicated) writing of such an interpreter is left as an
exercise to the reader ;)
