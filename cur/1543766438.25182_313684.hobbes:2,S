Uh, I have no idea whether verifying a signature of a commit object 
is sufficient, ie equivalent to signing each file.
commit refers to tree objects, which I presume lists the SHA-1 object 
IDs of files, but IIRC Linus already described why a signature of the 
commit object should not be used to trust the rest of commit.. (i'll 
have to find his mail). If so, an index is required.
