Agreed. Can't believe the initial UP v SMP results got slashdotted on 
kerneltrap. I doubt anyone made any sense of them let alone made any useful 
comment relating to them. I'll drop them in the interest of time and signal 
to noise ratio.

A run through previous tests and a fresh run with vanilla 2.4.20 shows just as 
much variation. It seems to be more a function of SMP rather than 2.5.
