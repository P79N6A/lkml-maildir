Is your UPS using "modern" hardware handshaking (CTS = PC can send,
with RTS practically always asserted)? Or perhaps the "old",
"half-duplex" V.24-style (RTS asserted before TX and then waiting for
CTS)?
Are you sure it uses hw handshaking at all? Most (all?) UPSes I used
had only TxD and RxD (for RS-232).
