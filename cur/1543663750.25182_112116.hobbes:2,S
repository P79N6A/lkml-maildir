SPECint a microbenchmark?  You seem to be redefining the meaning of
the word (last time I checked, lmbench was a microbenchmark).
Ironically, Itanium 2 seems to do even better in the "real world" than
suggested by benchmarks, partly because of the large caches, memory
bandwidth and, I'm guessing, partly because of it's straight-forward
micro-architecture (e.g., a synchronization operation takes on the
order of 10 cycles, as compared to order of dozens and hundres of
cycles on the Pentium 4).
BTW: I hope I don't sound too negative on the Pentium 4/Xeon.  It's
certainly an excellent performer for many things.  I just want to
point out that Itanium 2 also is a good performer, probably more so
than many on this list seem to be willing to give it credit for.
