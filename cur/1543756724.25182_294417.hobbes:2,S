Yes, thanks. Sorry my fault. I had it not deactivated, arggg.

No warnings/errors in both logs. All clean. But switching/maximizing 
between tasks like firefox, thunderbird or a gnome-terminal is so slow, 
that you can see it how firefox/GTK+ theme is writing the GUI and the 
fonts slowly back. Minimizing is no more fun, like a fast slide-show. And 
that on a fast amd64 3200 with 1 GB RAM and a FX 5900XT. :(
With the nVidia own nv_agp it appears directly in all apps, very fast 
under GNOME 2.8.1. Why, I do not know. Also game (opengl) performance is 
faster with the nv_agp, that I haven't used the kernel agp for months, now.
Greetings,
