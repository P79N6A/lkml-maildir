You can't disable MMX/SSE because its used to optimise, if you don't want
to use SSE/MMX select a non-SSE/MMX cpu in the kernel config, that way
you'll lose those assembly optimisations. If you want to impare your CPU
even more (as seems the case) consider using 486 as a CPU target and perhaps also
cripple your cpu caches (ie set bit 0x1E (CD) in cr0).
