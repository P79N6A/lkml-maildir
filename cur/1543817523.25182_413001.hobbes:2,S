After some more thought and consulting with Pavel and folks, the path of 
least resistance for now seems like not to switch to bigsmp.
We will need to do a little bit more work to ensure that we can work the
physical flat mode (bigsmp) instead of logical flat mode in i386. Primarily
to ensure configs for SMP_SUSPEND, any memory hotplug prototype in i386 dont
break by  choosing bigsmp as default to ensure transition is smooth.
Andrew, please help queuing this patch. (Since pavel just reverted the 
HOTPLUG_CPU depends on X86_GENERICARCH recently in git9, people will now
see the funky error message that they have more than 8 cpus until this patch 
is included.)

Switching to automatic bigsmp causes an misleading error message, that
more then 8 cpus are detected, and user needs to select either X86_GENERICARCH
or X86_BIGSMP to handle. 
Reason is we switched to bigsmp to avoid IP race when new cpu is comming up.
[bigsmp is nothing but using physical flat mode that can work for 1 .. 255 cpus]
[default is X86_PC, that uses logical flat mode up to 8 CPUs max]
Current x86_64 code uses bigsmp as default when hotplug is enabled.
It would be preferable to make bigsmp as default, and work the dependencies
of other related code like SMP_SUSPEND, and some related to memory hotplug
code for i386.
Current logical flat mode doesnt use shortcuts that cause the race by
using the send_IPI_mask() instead of shortcuts when HOTPLUG_CPU is enabled.
In the meantime this patch is the path of lease resistance. 
We will switch to bigsmp default sometime soon, when we get to work it again.
