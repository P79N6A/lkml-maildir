I don't think anyone's assembled a HOWTO ...  You can get some hints
at 
http://www.torque.net/parport/cdr.html
 
Basically, if you have a 2.2 kernel, you should be able to load up the
paride drivers (depending on what device you have) and build Joerg
Schilling's cdrecord to use "pg".  
If you have problems, join the linux-parport mailing list and we'll try 
to help.
