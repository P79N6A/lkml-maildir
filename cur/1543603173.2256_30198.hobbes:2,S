We proved this a year+ ago.  We've got some code brewing to do fair sharing
of IRQs for heavy load situations.  I don't have all the details, but
eventually...

Our solution/needs are slightly different - we want to service as many
interrupts as possible and do as much network traffic as possible, and
interactive-tasks be damned.
