No, it is not running any session tracking (ip_conntrack) neither it
does nat. It is just a firewall with around 1600 rules in FORWARD
mangle table and around 1500 rules in FORWARD filter table. Out of
1500 rules , 1377 rules are MAC filter rules.
And it had 3 alias address for the interface conneted to the wirelss.
