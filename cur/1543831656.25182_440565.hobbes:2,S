Vladimir, it sounds like he found another place you might insert this
comment:
+/*
+ * When calling the filesystem for writes, there is processing
+ * that must be done:
+ * 1) per word
+ * 2) per page
+ * 3) per call to the FS
+ * If the FS is called per page, then it turns out that 3) costs more
+ * than 1) and 2) for sophisticated filesystems.  To allow the FS to
+ * choose to pay the cost of 3) only once we call batch_write, if the
+ * FS supports it.
+ */
Thanks Pekka!
