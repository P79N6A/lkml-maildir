I misspelt 'sourceforge' on first attempt - shame on me,
 not SF :)

Uhm - not sure I understand. I thought both ircomm and irport
 were needed, at least it looks like so from this 2.4.21-pre3
 output from my live GPRS link:
[root@dolphin root]# lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by    Not tainted
ircomm-tty             22528   1  (autoclean)
ppp_async               7744   1  (autoclean)
ppp_generic            16060   3  (autoclean) [ppp_async]
slhc                    5200   0  (autoclean) [ppp_generic]
smc-ircc                7520   1  (autoclean)
irport                  5256   1  (autoclean) [smc-ircc]
ircomm                  8712   0  [ircomm-tty]
irda                   94192   1  [ircomm-tty smc-ircc irport ircomm]
 that is, pppd speaks on /dev/ircomm0 - but smc-ircc seems to
 use irport.

I would gladly oblige :) but how do I know what the proper IRQ
 is ? findchip does tell me that on this CPx750J, but it doesn't
 tell me anything on the C640...

Thanks, will get back with more news soon-ish.
