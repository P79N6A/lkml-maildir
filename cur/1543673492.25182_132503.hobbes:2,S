I don't think you need that redundancy - at the end of the day, it
is much simpler to just have the common task struct (could we say,
process?) with the shared stuff - replication is nice, but not in
this area.

Beats me ... maybe there are performance concerns I am not aware
of, or simply, it has not been tackled. This is something I have
on my list of "would be interesting to work on".

Kill me ... my apologies; sometimes it seems that I don't master 
reading as much as I thought :]
