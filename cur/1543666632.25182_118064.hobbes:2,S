I'm configuring kernel 2.4.20 for my system, and I noticed a new option 
called "zlib compression support".  However, there is no documentation 
for it anywhere, so I would be very grateful if someone were to 
enlighten me as to what it is before I compile my kernel...  Please make 
sure to reply to me as well as to the list as I am not subscribed.
Thanks,
William
