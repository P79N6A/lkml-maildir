The exported symbols can be extracted just as easily from System.map as 
from vmlinux, so I think I still don't understand your point. (And chances 
are higher that System.map is in /boot than an uncompressed vmlinux). 
depmod does give correct warnings, but only at modules install time, not 
at modules build time, that's what I was trying to say.
