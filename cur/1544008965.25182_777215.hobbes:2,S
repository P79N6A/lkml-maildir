The perfmon context abstraction dealt with that.  Code using the
perfmon interfaces provided a set of counter and control register
values to the kernel.
The kernel merely loaded and unloaded them when a process (or group of
processes) ran.
The kernel is a validity checker, and that minimal stuff is exactly
what the perfmon kernel component implemented.
