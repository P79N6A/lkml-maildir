    Thanks a lot for your help :)) FYI, this question is related to
the virtual-console-only init clone that I wrote some time ago (I
used sysvinit for inspiration and good advice), I think I wrote you
about this. Anyway, you are in the acknowledgement list doubly, now
;))) I'm going to release this init in a week or so, after having
using it for more than a year at home without problems.

    How about portability? Not that worries me, since this code will
go to a Linux-only program, just curiosity. Other OSes do the same
stack layout?
