Hi Marcelo, et al,
Just wanted to report an instantaneous reboot problem with 2.4.24-pre1.
I don't even see any printk's to the screen; as soon as LILO is finished 
loading the new kernel, the screen blanks and the BIOS goes through its 
boot sequence again.  Since I seem to be the only one reporting this to 
LKML, I suspect I'll have to back out various patches to try to track 
this down. :-P
I'm using the same .config as in 2.4.23 with new questions left at their 
defaults (e.g. XFS=n, OOM_KILLER=n).  I've had no problems with this 
otherwise rock-stable platform for all varieties of 2.4.x, save for some 
early USB EHCI issues long ago.
At work now, so I don't have a full .config handy, but:
* Slackware 8.1 based; glibc 2.2.5; gcc 2.95.3
* Soltek SL-75DRV2 (UP, Athlon XP 1700, VIA KT266A [VT8366A/VT8233])
* Root = ext3 on IDE partition
* DevFS, DevPTS, IDE-SCSI=cdrom0, USBStorage, USB EHCI, VFAT
* RadeonFB, IPTables, Realtek-8139
Everything else in .config is pretty vanilla (e.g. Linus defaults or 
thereabouts).
