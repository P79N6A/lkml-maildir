This looks good to me.  Do you also need to take the semaphore in
autofs4_catatonic_mode(), around the hijacking of the queue?
void autofs4_catatonic_mode(struct autofs_sb_info *sbi)
{
	struct autofs_wait_queue *wq, *nwq;
	DPRINTK(("autofs: entering catatonic mode\n"));
	sbi->catatonic = 1;
	wq = sbi->queues;
	sbi->queues = NULL;	/* Erase all wait queues */
