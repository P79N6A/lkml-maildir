Hi,
  I'm using kernel 2.4.13 and am experiencing problems with dynamic executables 
in chroot environments and also in the initrd environment. These problems don't 
seem to have existed in 2.4.9 or 2.4.12. In the chroot and initrd 
environments , static executables run as expected but dynamic ones always 
return permission denied (EACCESS according to strace.) I don't believe it is a 
library issue because the same environments (and initrds) work fine with the 
2.4.9 and 2.4.12 releases. Does anyone have any ideas about what I might have 
done wrong (odd kernel option, etc.. ), or is this a bug ?
Thanks,
-Rob
