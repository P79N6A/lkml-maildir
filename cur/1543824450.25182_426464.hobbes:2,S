Thanks for this list. Looks like if I'm going to do any code writing it won't 
be solo, because a lot of this stuff  - mostly the scheduler and interrupt 
handling - is way over my head. (However, I will try to learn and will be 
doing even more research when I get to the point where this is needed to be 
done)
