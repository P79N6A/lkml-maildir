A colleage told me to try this yesterday and if I remember correctly, it did
not help. I may try it again because I'm not sure whether it wasn't some other
issue thing did not work, but I'm absolutely sure that no matter what these
settings are, the machine does not resume or hangs soon after resume (in the
case of s2disk). And this is since 2.6.20. 2.6.21 just added the 'wait until
keypress'.
