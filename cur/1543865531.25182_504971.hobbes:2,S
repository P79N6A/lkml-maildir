Okay so.. what do I define now to use libsata with this controller?
I thought PATA_OLDPIIX would be it, like it is just that for VIA,SIL
and Promise.
And, maybe its a good idea to make it so that if you select
PATA_OLDPIIX it automaticly selects the dependencies aswell? I see
this happen a lot with other kernel things, like V4L2 and so.
Obviously just selecting PATA_OLDPIIX makes you have a half-configured
kernel config for this controller, and i used "make menuconfig", I
didnt manually edit the .config file.
