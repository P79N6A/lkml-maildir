The transfer without dma is supposed to be a little slower.
This could be delay enough to avoid timeout on the fast ide-cdrom.
If that's all, consider modifying cdrecord so it polls the reading
cdrom now and then preventing timeout.
Or use a smaller buffer so there won't be time for timing out.
Or a much bigger buffer, so there will be time for spinning up.
