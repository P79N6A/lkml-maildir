It doesn't have to run mostly in the kernel.  It just has to be in the
kernel when the I/O-bound tasks awakes.  Further, there are plenty of
what we consider CPU-bound tasks that are interactive and/or
graphics-oriented and this adds much to their time in the kernel.
In a given period of time, a CPU bound task can run at any allotment
within it is given.  On the other hand, an I/O-bound task spends much
time blocked and thus can only run when I/O is available and it is
awake.  It is thus advantageous to schedule it within the bounds of the
I/O being available, and as tightly in those bounds as possible.  This
more fairly distributes scheduling to all tasks.  Same goes for RT
tasks, interactive tasks, etc.
The result is faster wake-up-to-run and thus higher throughput.  I just
sent some dbench scores to correlate this.

While we certainly need tangible empirical benefits, users finding their
desktop experience smoother and thus more enjoyable is just about the
best thing we can ask for.
