17 USC 1201 (a)(1)(A) says:
"No person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls
access to a work protected under this title. The prohibition contained in the
preceding sentence shall take effect at the end of the 2-year period beginning
on the date of the enactment of this chapter."
OK, so Adobe managed to make the case that rot-13 was an "effective control".
Given that the GPL specifically allows you to change the source and thus bypass
the EXPORT_GPL, I doubt you can make the case for "effective".
Of course, IANAL, just a sysadmin who can read.  If the definition of "effective"
is likely to matter to you, get legal advice from a qualified expert.
