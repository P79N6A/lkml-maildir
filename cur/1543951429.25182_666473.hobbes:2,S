Hi Greg,
The following series of patches contains some fixes of the PM core related to
the suspending and resuming of devices.  All of the details are (hopefully)
described in the patches' changelogs.
These patches are targeted at 2.6.26, but we (the authors) would like them to
get as much linux-next and -mm testing as possible, so please add them to your
queue.
Thanks,
Rafael
