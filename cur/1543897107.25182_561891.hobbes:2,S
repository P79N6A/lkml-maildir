Fine by me as well, FWIW. My points about per-cpu/node queues were not
to say that I'm really opposed to getting this in first. In a way, you
sell yourself short with the patch name: the implementation may be just
a basic one, but simplicity is a key point of SLOB... Adding numa
awareness to the slob APIs is obviously a key step and makes it much
easier to experiment with enhancements to the implementation.
Unless it has been picked up already, I'd call it "initial NUMA support"
;) Thanks! Would be great to hear about your experiences using SLOB as
well -- how much memory you're saving, how it performs, etc.
