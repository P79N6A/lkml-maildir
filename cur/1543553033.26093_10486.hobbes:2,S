I hate your patch.
I'd rather see "Rules.make" just base itself entirely off the new-style
Makefiles, and have it use "$(obj-y)" instead of O_OBJS etc.
Then, _old_style Makefiles could be fixed up by doing a
	include Compat.make
or preferably by just fixing them. I don't want to have another
Rules.make. I want to fix the old users.
(Compat.make would then look like
	obj-y = $(OX_OBJS) $(O_OBJS)
	export-objs = $(OX_OBJS)
	...
and make _old_ Makefiles look like new ones as far as Rules.make is
concerned.
See? 
This is the same as with source code. I do NOT want to have backwards
compatibility in source code - if compatibility is needed, I'd much rather
have it be _forwards_ compatibility, where the old setup is made to look
like the new with wrapper functions etc.
