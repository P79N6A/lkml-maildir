The problem here is that some random piece of code has bumped
the preemption counter, and we've lost all trace of that at
the site where the problem is detected.
So...  In do_initcalls() we'd need:
        do {
                (*call)();
+		if (in_atomic())
+			printk("initcall at %p is buggy\n", call);
                call++;
        } while (call < &__initcall_end);
and to diagnose this particular problem I guess we need to
add
	if (in_atomic())
		printk("goofed at %d\n", __LINE__);
to twenty or so places in start_kernel().
