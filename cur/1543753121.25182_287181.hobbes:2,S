Given that companies like Intel have been published the SD
initialisation sequences since 2002 and nobody has taken any action I
can't see this as being credibly a trade secret or obtained maliciously.
Nor does the document state anything is secret.
See Intel app note 278533-001 "Using SDCard and SDIO with Intel (r)
PXA250 Applications Processor MMC Controller" 
http://www.intel.com/design/pca/applicationsprocessors/applnots/278533-001.htm
If there were any secrets the owners appear to have failed to take any
action neccessary to defend them.
