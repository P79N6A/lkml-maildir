Hi,
 As I promised I am sending a patch that solves problems with Linux
interrupt handling I encountered recently.  Changes needed turned out to
be more massive than I expected at the first moment and hence the delay.
 The attached patch addresses the following issues:
1. The 82489DX APIC timer is not initialized properly.  Additionally the
calibrating routine does not try to use TSC on systems that do not support
it.
2. The fixed MP configuration #2 does not create an ExtINT entry for the
purpose of IRQ0 handling.
3. The 82489DX APIC version is recognized.  The Arbitration ID register is
not being read from the I/O unit of 82489DX as it's not present there.
4. Spurious 8259A interrupts are not recognized and are treated as if they
were real interrupts.
5. Interrupt service routines cannot determine whether the IRQ was
delivered by APIC or 8259A PIC (important in the symmetric I/O mode for
the recognition of spurious 8259A IRQs).
6. Local APIC interrupts are not initialized at all, which usually results
in massive spurious 8259A interrupts in the case I/O APIC delivers ExtINT
interrupts (or, to be exact, any interrupts that pass through the 8259A).
7. Some obvious typos I happened to find in the sources related to IRQ
handling on i386 are fixed.
 In addition to the above fixes, the patch provides the following
enhancements:
1. Before reverting to ExtINT interrupts, the 8254 timer IRQ is tried to
be set up as a lowest priority I/O APIC IRQ (the through-8259A mode),
which makes its service to be distributed among CPUs and if it fails, it's
being set up as a fixed Local APIC interrupt (the local through-8259A
mode).  Either of these solutions should work if IRQ0 is the only
interrupt line that has no direct connection to I/O APIC (most if not all
boards that have any IRQ lines not connected to I/O APIC).  They have the
advantage of involving less circuitry (we need not care of ExtINTA trap
working right) and the through-8259A mode prevents from overloading one of
CPUs, too.
2. Spurious 8259A interrupts are counted and logged.  This allows
detecting system hw problems resulting in glitches on IRQ lines.
 See the sources for details.
