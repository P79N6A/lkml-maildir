Doesn't change anything here.

Here's my test:
1) login remotely and run 'watch -n 1 cat /proc/interrupts'
2) start gpm
	int 12 appears
3) hit some keys
	int 1 count goes up
4) touch mouse (touch pad =)
	int 12 count does not increase
	keyboard is locked
	int 1 count no longer will increase
5) kill gpm
	int 12 disappears
	keyboard is now functional and all keys that were pressed are
		serviced
	int 1 goes up when the keys were processed
I could be wrong on this one, but it appears that the IRQs are no longer
working.  I can't say if the hardware is really sending the irq, or linux
just can't see it when the psaux driver is in use.
