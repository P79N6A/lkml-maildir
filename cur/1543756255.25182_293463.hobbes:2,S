Well `cdparanoia` will read, analyze/rip, and reject trashed CDs
without ever hanging the Linux-2.4.22 kernel, but will immediately
hang linux-2.6.10.
Basically, when you start getting the kernel error messages on
linux-2.4.22, you can ^C out and everything will quiet down.
With Linux-2.6.10, nothing entered from the keyboard will
do anything. Since the Caps-Lock key still functions, interrupts
are still active. However, it is likely the kernel-lock that
prevents signals (like ^C or ^/) from being executed.
