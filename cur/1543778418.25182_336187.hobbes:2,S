hmm, how can I use ioctl to find the location device since I need the location
to pass it to ioctl ?
I can't find "pinpad/input0" in sysfs, does that mean I need to add sysfs
suppport in my driver, and it's not done in input module when I register 
my input driver ?

Actually I'm working on an embedded system which owns a pinpad controller.
This controller is accessed by using io mem and it talks to the pinpad through
a dedicated bus. So I accessed it through io space.
thanks,
         Francis.
