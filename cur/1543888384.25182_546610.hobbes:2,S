C7 Esther:
Hmm, I expect the NX-Bit should be detected from linux during the
boot. The NX function bit seems to be at the same place where it's
located for other CPU.
Unfortunately I have no C7 hardware and I am too much a beginner
in kernel programming to prepare this "dry".
May be a "senior kernel programmer" can easy check if the C7 runs
through the regular NX-function detection?
Best regards,
Christian
