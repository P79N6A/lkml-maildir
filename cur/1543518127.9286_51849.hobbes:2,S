Subject: [2.3.29] Easy way to get "/ is busy" on shutdown
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/12/7/2

Scenario:
Root fs is on /dev/hdc1 (ext2)
/home/win is on /dev/hda1/linuxfs (standard file on vfat partition)
/mnt/win (/dev/hda1) is automounted by automount (just a simple 'cd /mnt/win')
Do:
losetup /dev/loop0 /mnt/win/linuxfs
e2fsck /dev/loop0 (just to be safe)
mount /dev/loop0 /home/win
Then initiate shutdown and you will be greeted to "/ is busy" and a full e2fsck
will result on next boot. :(
