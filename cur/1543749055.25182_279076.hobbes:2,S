I should clarify here, the device *does* matter, since the legacy I/O port 
space mapping will point at different addresses depending on the device.  
Generally, devices on the same bus will get the same address, but two devices 
on different busses will have different addresses mapped (at least on Altix).  
In your case, where you can route I/O ports to arbitrary busses, you could do 
the routing at the time of the call and return -EBUSY if another device was 
already using the route and hadn't released it yet.
