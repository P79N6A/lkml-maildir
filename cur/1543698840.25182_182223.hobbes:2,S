This last is unfounded.  It may be true to say that Sun could only
release Solaris+XYZ under the GPL, but it is fantasy to imagine that
this makes Solaris now GPLed.  That is simply not one of the
available legal remedies for breach of a copyright license.  Pamela
Jones of groklaw.net fame wrote a more authoritative article
covering this point at 
http://lwn.net/Articles/61292/
 (unfortunately
subscriber-only for the next week, I think).  She cited (FSF's
lawyer) Eben Moglen:
    The claim that a GPL violation could lead to the forcing open of
    proprietary code that has wrongfully included GPL'd components
    is simply wrong. There is no provision in the Copyright Act to
    require distribution of infringing work on altered terms. What
    copyright plaintiffs are entitled to, under the Act, are
    damages, injunctions to prevent infringing distribution,
    and--where appropriate--attorneys' fees. A defendant found to
    have wrongfully included GPL'd code in its own proprietary work
    can be mulcted in damages for the distribution that has already
    occurred, and prevented from distributing its product further.
    That's a sufficient disincentive to make wrongful use of GPL'd
    program code. And it is all that the Copyright Act permits.
(At first, I had hoped that "mulcted" was a typo for "mulched", but
then I looked it up.)
It might be true that Sun's misdeed perpetually voids their license
to XYZ.  RMS argued similarly after QT was GPLed to accomodate KDE
(and explicitly "forgave" the breach wrt FSF-owned code).  But this
is entirely different from forcing anyone to put their own code
under some particular license.

Again, totally groundless AFAICT.  This is not within the scope of
what a copyright license can require, and runs directly counter to
my (meager) knowledge of case law.  Courts generally don't force
violators to license material under specific terms (except perhaps
in antitrust cases).

Your comparisons to the SCO case are far-fetched.  In part because
of what I said above (your idea of "viral" is divorced from
reality), and in part because there is a diverse range of
boundaries, and any judge can see that there is a wide gulf between
the kernel-module boundary and the unix-"anything that's ever
touched unix even through N indirections" boundary.  We are not on a
slippery slope.

You seem to think that this boundary thing is black and white.  "If
the GPL crosses the kernel-module boundary, any license can cross
any boundary."  I think you have to do better than that.
