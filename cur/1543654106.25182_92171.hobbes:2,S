	I have been thinking about splitting depmod into two programs:
the program as originally designed that generates modules.dep and one
that generates hardware support files.  The latter could be
distributed in the Linux kernel tree and perhaps installed in
/lib/modules/<version>/bin/ to make it easy to change support table
formats as needed.

	I'm guessing this is for symbols.  If it's for something other
reason, I'd be curious to know it.

	I'm honored by the offer, but I have not seen any convincing
accounting of real benefits and costs that shows that it is a win to
have the module loader in kernel memory.  I might be interested in
maintaining a small modutils that could be compiled to support either
the in-kernel module load or a user level method (or both) so as to
avoid unnecessary differences between the user level and in-kernel
methods, given that the code that is specific to the kernel module
loader would be small.
