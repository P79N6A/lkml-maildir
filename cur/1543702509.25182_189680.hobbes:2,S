Yes, but the machine hard locks.  sysrq does not work.  I have a small
utility I wrote that will set the state of the parport (I used this to tell
if it locks up) using outb to the port (This does not effect it in anyway,
it will lockup w/o it running)
This is also the first time I backed up this machine.  2.6.0 is the first
kernel I installed on it.  I can test 2.4.23 later.

I am constantly accessing NFS with this machine.  Read and write.  It was
only when I backed it up with tar.  In the event it doesn't lock, tar
crashes w/o error/warning (over NFS).

It locks up usually at one point, but not always.

I can do this I think.  It's fun when running with init being bash.  It will
take some time to do since I can't scroll backwards.

I can try TCP, but I'm not sure about the server accepting TCP (was there a
compile time option for NFSD to use TCP?)  These 2 machines are the only
ones I have on 2.6.

100 FD always.
