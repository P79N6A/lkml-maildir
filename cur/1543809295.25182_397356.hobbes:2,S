I narrowed it further.  The short story is that this commit (diff below
sig) makes the second S3 sleep go into the endless loop, if the loaded
modules are exactly thermal, processor, intel_agp, and agpgart:
53f11d4ff8797bcceaf014e62bd39f16ce84baec is first bad commit

If I boot with ec_intr=0, the second sleep works fine.
Here is the full story.  First I tried a system with the minimal set of
modules to boot and run X (S3 sleep-wake wrecks the VGA consoles, but X
restores fine with 'chvt 1; sleep 0.5 ; chvt 7' on wakeup).  So I
stopped every service and unloaded all modules possible, which left only
intel_agp and agpgart.  Then, for each of the usual loaded modules
(except for sound modules, which often has sleep-wake problems anyway),
I tried:
1. Load the module
2. S3 sleep-wake-sleep-wake
3. Unload the module
to see whether the second sleep went into the infinite loop (visible
across the console).  The one culprit I found was 'thermal' (which
brings in 'processor').  Other modules didn't trigger the problem.
Then I recompiled using a minimal config, with only networking (for X to
work) and the acpi modules, and maybe a few others that I couldn't
avoid, and retested to make sure 'thermal' still triggered the problem,
which it did.  I used this config, or one just like it for 2.6.15, as a
base for all other kernels in the bisection search, using the nearest
ancestor's .config and then
   yes '' | make oldconfig
to make the new .config
Eventually bisection converged to the commit above, and then I retested
that kernel with 'ec_intr=0'.
Is this a problem with the TP 600X hardware, in which case I'll just use
ec_intr=0 forever, or is there more software debugging (DSDT or related
to the diff)?  I can turn on gobs of ACPI debugging and send the useful
parts of the log file.
In the bisection, many kernels worked fine, meaning that the second S3
cycle returned and I could compile the next bisection kernel.  In doing
that I noticed another problem, that the fan would not turn on with some
of these good kernels even though the system was hot enough (plenty of
chance for it to turn on since the next compile heated up the CPU).  For
example, acpi -t showed
     Thermal 1: ok, 46.0 degrees C
     Thermal 2: active[0], 42.0 degrees C
     Thermal 3: ok, 31.0 degrees C
     Thermal 4: ok, 34.0 degrees C
but the fan was off.  
So whenever I had a good kernel (meaning taht S3 sleep-wake-sleep-wake
returned), I checked whether the fan would turn on, to collect data for
a separate bisection search.  However, the data seems inconsistent.  If
I feed the data to a fresh git bisect, it complains about one commit
being marked both good and bad.  So I'll ask on the git list about that
issue.
