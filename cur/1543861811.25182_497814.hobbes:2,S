It's OK if you don't do it too often ;-)

Pick the latest, it has bugs in earlier ones fixed. But it might have its
own ;-)
BTW, you can track the day-to-day development of the kernel (and other
stuff) using git, which has other nifty features (like being able to go
back to an earlier version, and even automate the finding of the broken
patch by narrowing down from a known good and a known bad version).
git is probably in your distribution, or you can get it (as source, or
prebuilt) from <
http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git>,
 a bunch of
documentation is in the package itself or at <
http://www.git.or.cz

Good luck!
