I have an Armada V300 laptop that uses the maestro2 chipset (and I
wouldn't be surprised if your E500 used that very same chip) and it
works fine with the ALSA provided in kernels since the 2.6.10-mm era
(actually, I think it worked fine with even earlier kernels, but I am
not sure).
Just another datapoint, Rogério.
