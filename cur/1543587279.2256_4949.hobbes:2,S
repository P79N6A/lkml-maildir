What you can try is to turn on slab debugging. Set the  FORCED_DEBUG
define in mm/slab.c to one and recompile. Does it change any pattern
when you dump the data in the skbs or pings? 
If yes someone is playing with already freed packets.
Furthermore you can instrument other parts with good old printk.
And what NIC are you using btw?
