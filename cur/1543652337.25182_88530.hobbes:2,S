Subject: strange behaviour with statfs() call, looking for advice

I seem to be getting some strange interactions between kernel space and 
userspace with the statfs() call.
On an nfs-mounted but unaccessable system, the statfs() call is 
returning a block count of 4294967295.  Since the kernel statfs struct 
has this field defined as a long and this is a 32-bit system, this is 
somewhat confusing.
It turns out that the userspace headers define the "blocks" field as a 
__fsblkcnt_t, which is then defined as __u_long.
What do I do?  Do I cast it to a long since I know that this is what the 
kernel is using?
The system in question is a yellowdog system, but the same problem is 
present on a recent mandrake box as well.  Is this a redhat issue?
Thanks,
Chris
