Yes, sorry I didn't answer your question: ALSA basically wants to be
able to have that memory mmapable by userspace programs, and it doesn't
care whether this is via compound pages or split pages.

I don't think it would be hard. Just need a bit of thinking about how
to go about composing some sort of GFP_USERMAP that can easily be
handled by all allocators, without costing performance or being too
intrusive.
I suspect I won't have time to wade into such an exercise until after
OLS. But I could give a quick review for anyone who does ;)
