Above is from scsi_set_pci_device() call.

Above are from scsi_register_host().

Looks like we have two device_register(&shost->host_driverfs_dev) calls,
one in scsi_set_pci_device, and one in scsi_register_host(). I think 
Mike meant to delete the one in scsi_register_host, but I can't tell
for certain which one should go away.
And this must might be why I can't shutdown (i.e. no auto reboot).
So in 2.5.44 have:
	scsi_register_host() calls
		attach [ncr_attach] calls
			scsi_register
			scsi_set_pci_device calls
				device_register(&shost->host_driverfs_dev)
		call to device_register() again in scsi_register_host
This removes the scsi_register_host() one, I can shutdown/reboot
with this patch, I didn't dump anything else or try rmmod's:

A Scsi_Host_Template is passed in, it loops over Scsi_Hosts to find
everyone that is using the Scsi_Host_Template, the names are confusing
as well as the code.

Yes and yes ...
