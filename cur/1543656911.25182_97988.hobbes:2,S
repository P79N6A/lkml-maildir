Some platforms (like certain ES7000s) won't tolerate any bit masks
programmed into the RTE because their balancing is done entirely in
hardware, similar to XTPR mechanism for Fosters. For those I suggest to have
an escape door, in the form of boot parameter such as "irq_balance=no". It
was suggested to us by SuSE and worked great - I could turn it off in our
platform code unconditionally. It could also help those who can use irq
balancing as is but might want to implement their own balancing schema.
