	Look for  /proc/nnn/maps  listed inodes.
	They don't show up in open files, because they aren't "open"
	in usual filedescriptor sense...  (open file, mmap it, close the
	fd --> mmapped region without open file, but the inode (and file)
	is in use.)
	The symptoms you have are very familiar to me as glibc 2.1.1
	contained BSD DB 2.x BTREE seems to leak mmap()ed file regions.
	You may have the same, or some other leakage.
	Look for things like these in the mmap lists:

	I would love to see a tool capable to do this thing smartly - lsof
	tries to be too low-level tool in most cases, and refuses to work
	if kernel symbol tables don't match the compiled in data...
	However, "cat" is quite potent tool in itself..
