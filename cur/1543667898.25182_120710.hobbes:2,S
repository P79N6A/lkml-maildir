Basically what we're talking about now is someone to maintain an "errata
tree" -- someone to maintain sub-point releases (2.4.25.1, .2, etc.) and
to decide what those are.
The other option would be to have it called something like
2.4.25-ep36-ep42-ep96 if errata patches 36, 42 and 96 were applied.
I think sub-point releases are better, since it at least cuts down the
number of possible combinations.
