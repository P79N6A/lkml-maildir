arch/alpha/math-emu/math.c still uses MOD_{INC,DEC}_USE_COUNT to protect
from unloading which is
 a) unsafe
 b) in the way of nuking them as soon as 2.7 is out
any chance we could either do a try_module_get on a struct module
*fp_emul_module in alpha core code before or completely disallow module
unloading for it (by removing the cleanup_module() callback)?
