Hmm.  It's *morally* wrong since there's really no requirement that
a machine with ACPI serial should have PCI ... but on the other hand,
we're unlikely to see a machine without PCI that requires us to discover
ACPI serial ports.

himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
