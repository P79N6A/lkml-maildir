There are multiple components involved here. This includes user space, 
cpusets and kernel support for various forms of migrating pages.

The policy layer stuff is already Kconfigurable via CONFIG_NUMA. 
I think the lower layer in vmscan.c could be always included since its 
currently small and its just a variation on swap. However, if we add the 
rest of the features contained in the hot plug then the code size becomes 
significant and we may want to have a config variable for that.
