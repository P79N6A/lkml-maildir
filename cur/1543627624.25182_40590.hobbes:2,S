Judging from the performance regression above it would seem the
new defaults suck rocks.
Can we please stop optimising Linux for a single workload benchmark
and start tuning it for the common case of running multiple kinds
of applications and making sure one application can't mess up the
others ?
Personally I couldn't care less if my tar went 30% faster if it
meant having my desktop unresponsive for the whole time.
