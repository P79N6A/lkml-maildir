If someone does, say,
	prefetch_range(some_pointer, sizeof(*some_pointer));
then it is possible that prefetch_range() could
a) execute a prefetch at addresses which are not PREFETCH_STRIDE-aligned
   and, as a consequence,
b) prefetch data from the next page, outside the range of the user's
   (addr,len).
