Don't do that.
I think it would be much better to instead do something like
	obj-y += mmconfig_$(CONFIG_WORD_SIZE).o
to make it clear when we have a file that is conceptually the same, but 
has different implementations.
That also makes the unification (assuming/hoping it gets done) of such 
files much cleaner - you just merge them, and the obj-y line can just drop 
the $(CONFIG_WORD_SIZE) thing. Very logical.

.. the above approach also gets rid of any link order problems.
