I am now testing with a .24-rc7+fix  kernel.  So far so good.  Running gentoo's 32 bit
firefox with flash 9 is a good way to trigger the problem here as is running Delftship (freeship)
under wine.  The problem is usually worst with a fully preemptive kernel.  I have been using both on 
a kernel with preempt and have an uptime of 22 hours - this is really good.   I have rarely been able 
to get this much uptime using these apps.  If it manages to run for a few more days without a lockup 
it would really be worth trying to figure out what in .24 fixes the problem...
THANKS!
