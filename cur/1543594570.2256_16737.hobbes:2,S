Two things:
1) It broke apparently with gcc 2.95.3 when patching from 2.4.6-pre2 ->
2.4.6pre3
2) I tried building it with gcc 3.00 and had same result.
3) I now have gcc 3.00 and going to rebuild 2.4.6-pre2 and see if reiserfs
panics if it doesn't there's an issue with the new pre3 modifications.
I hope ReiserFS *MAINTAINS* compatability from slightly older revisions,
or even migrates systems over to handle new issues.
