Subject: [PATCH] x86-64 only: ia32entry.S reg changes dropped during debugging
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Andi, 
We develop a debugger for linux x86-64 called TotalView. We have 
recently tracked down a problem to the fact that some register changes
made by the debugger in the target are getting discarded. This is only 
happening with the 2.4.x kernels on x86-64. It appears that the 
bug may have been fixed as a side effect of some other change in 2.6.x.
The scenario is that the debugger uses ptrace(PTRACE_SYSCALL,) and 
changes some registers in the process while it is stopped in a
system call. We are finding that the system call entry code discards 
changes to R15, R14, R13, R12, RBP, and RBX.
The following patch is against arch/x86_64/ia32/ia32entry.S in 2.4.26.
