I've never looked at the POSIX ACL spec, so forgive my ignorance.

While it would be nice to have user-definable ACL groups ("my friends"
or "History 255 TAs") in addition to existing users and groups, I still
don't find this to be critical. Sure, it adds (possibly quite a bit of)
extra data to every file, but it gives you the granularity you need for
the situation I described.  It seems like user-definable ACL groups
would be a nice extra feature on top of existing users or groups, but
not a necessity.

Ugh, that seems dangerous. Too many forgotten ACL links and then I could
accidentally give a vague acquaintance access to all my data meant for
close friends. 
Regardless, while ACLs do result in extra data per file being used, it
is my understanding that ACLs allow you to solve problems that currently
aren't solvable w/o administrator intervention. In my experience using
them w/ AFS, they have been extremely useful.
