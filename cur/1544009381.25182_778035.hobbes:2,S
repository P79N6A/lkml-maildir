Yeah, my patch happened to solve about the same problem (and mprintk
proper was ~370 lines, so it wasn't too bad).  Mine went the way of
assembling messages piece-by-piece and most of the complexities came
from buffer management and fallback (e.g. even if kmalloc fails to
allocate messages, messages still get printed out, albeit a bit
uglier).

No matter which mechanism, I'd love to have something to solve this in
kernel.  I face this problem quite often and each and every time I
have to come up with some custom hack to work around it.
FWIW, this was the last take of the mprintk patchset.
