For some workloads/machines it will simply cause an
approximately-proportional reduction in the size of the workload which we
can handle.
ie: there are some (oracle) workloads where the kernel craps out due to
lowmem vma exhaustion.  If they're now using remap_file_pages() for this then
it may not be a problem any more.  Ingo would know better than I.
