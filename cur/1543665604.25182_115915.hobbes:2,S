Since you identify this as the problem, do you propose a solution? A flag
indicating that default values are in place, perhaps? Better checks to
ensure that if LBA is used the geometry is forced sane in some way? I
don't think special case code is desirable in this case, at least beyond
checking a flag if that's what's needed.
