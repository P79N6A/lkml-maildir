Ok
We have a serious problem with file system corruption and I decided that
it must be hardware related w.r.t the drives.  I have since convinced
the boss to replace the existing quantum drives with segates.
we use a combination of IDE and UW scsi.  the scsi drives hang off a
diamond fireport card.  the Mobo is a Asus P2B-DS.  half a gig of ram
etc...
if there really is a FS corruption problem then the problems we are
having should still exist with the new drives yes??
we are not overclocking anything and the server really doesn't do that
much (barely gets a load above 1 so... )
if you would like anymore info I am not subscribed to these lists so...
I will tell you if we still have problems though and I don't see
anything say on Alan cox's diary or wherever
Cheers
Craig
