  Just put my usb flash card in my machine at work.  I had the switch
set to RO but need to update some files.  Removed the device, flipped
the switch to RW mode and re-inserted.  
SCSI device sda: 64512 512-byte hdwr sectors (33 MB)
sda: Write Protect is on
Is something cached?  USB is compiled into the kernel, no modules.
Anyway to clear this short of a reboot?
:wq!
