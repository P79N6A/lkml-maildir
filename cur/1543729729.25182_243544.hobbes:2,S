The shadowing logic is a must have for laptops. BenH and I discovered
this the hard way. Some laptops take the system and video ROM images,
combine them and then compress them into a ROM. At boot time these ROM
images are decompressed into RAM at C0000 and F0000. For these system
the only place to get the ROM data for things like video timings is
from the shadow area. Putting the shadow logic into the shared ROM code
lets up remove it from all of the video drivers. This lets us write
video drivers that don't care if the card is primary or secondary.
Video cards that are using the shadow copy don't need to be initially
reset. Since they are your boot display the system BIOS must have
already initialized them. Instead the you need the shadow image since
it may contain the timing data needed to change modes on a laptop display.
