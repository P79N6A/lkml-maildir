Subject: 2.4 direct_IO API changing?

I see in 2.4.22-BK-latest:
> -       int (*direct_IO)(int, struct inode *, struct kiobuf *, unsigned long, int);
> +       int (*direct_IO)(int, struct file *, struct kiobuf *, unsigned long, int
Should this really be changing in the middle of a stable series?
I realize that vendor's are already shipping this difference, but 
still...  it's a bit of an abrupt midseries change that can potentially 
break working code.
