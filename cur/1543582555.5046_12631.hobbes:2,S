I recall that in 2.2 the make_request code tested that the
buffers were contiguous in memory. From 2.2.18:
                        /* Can we add it to the end of this request? */
                        if (back) {
                                if (req->bhtail->b_data + req->bhtail->b_size
                                    != bh->b_data) {
                                        if (req->nr_segments < max_segments)
                                                req->nr_segments++;
                                        else break;
                                }
It looks to me like it tested that the b_data char* pointers of the
two requests being considered are exactly distant by the declared
size of one.
Is that no longer the case? If so, that's my answer.
