Would it not be best to give up hardcoding these page mapping levels into
the kernel? Linux should support N levels. pml4,pgd,pmd,pte needs to
disappear and be replaced by
pte_path[N]
We are duplicating code for pgd, pmd, pte and now pml again and again. The
code could be much simpler if this would be generalized. Various
architectures would support different levels without some strange
feature like f.e. pmd's being "optimized away".
Certainly the way that pml4 is proposed to be done is less invasive but we
are creating something more and more difficult to maintain.
