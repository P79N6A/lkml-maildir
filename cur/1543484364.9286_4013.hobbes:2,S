Yikes!  Apparently, trying to run 2.2.1 on top of a RH 5.1 distribution is a
really bad idea, especially with the "kernel modules 2.1.121 requirement."
I tried this and let's just say, this machine is hosed.  Luckily, this is
just one node in a multi-node PVM cluster :-)
Has anyone successfully done this?  Should I get a copy of 5.2 and try it
again?  I have been running 2.1.130 on RH 5.1 for a while with zero
problems.  I'll wait a while before rebuilding this box with 5.1.
Thanks in advance for any info.
