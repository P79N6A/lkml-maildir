OK, so you are doing lookup on foo from /bar/baz. You see that foo is a
directory and it has another parent. You see that this parent is nowhere
near dcache/icache. Worse yet, actually it's the end of *long* chain of
directories and none of them (except the root, that is) is in dcache. To
make it even nastier, suppose that there are fan-ins in that chain (i.e
some of those directories also have multiple parents). Your actions?
Now, assume that another lookup goes through the alternative path in the
same time from the other direction. Your actions wrt locking?
