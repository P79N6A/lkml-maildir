Hrm. Could you post the value for BogoMIPS that you're getting now?
My patches touch the __delay() code, since using the TSC based delay has
just as many, if not more, problems as the loop based delay. So I want
to be careful that my changes are not further causing problems.
Ingo, did you commented out ARCH_HAS_READ_CURRENT_TIMER because of
problems with the new calibration code?
thanks
