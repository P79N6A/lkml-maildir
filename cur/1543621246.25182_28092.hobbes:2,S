The machine ships with a CPU containing a local APIC, but if
Linux enables it, the machine hangs when the BIOS is entered,
i.e. at power management events and entry to BIOS setup screens.
On other machines that don't hang, the BIOS either handles the
local APIC itself, or it invokes the kernel's APM callback which
disables the local APIC before e.g. doing a suspend.
