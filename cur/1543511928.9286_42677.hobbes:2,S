I have a notebook with a Trident cyber9385 video chip running RedHat 6.0
with kernel 2.2.11.
The problem is in using the fn_CRT key.  I can not switch to CRT only mode.
The LCD shuts down, since you can just barely see the color darken, but
the CRT is still dead.  LCD-CRT together works.
If I boot to DOS the sequence works correctly (LCD, CRT, LCD-CRT).  If I
boot and switch modes while LILO is running the sequence works correctly.  
The problem occurs only after the kernel begins execution.  
I have tried various vga modes offered from vga=ask but have not see any 
change in behaviour.
I looked for additional information on the CONFIG_VIDEO_GFX_HACK, but the
URL given in Documentation/svga.txt is no longer there.
Any suggestions?
