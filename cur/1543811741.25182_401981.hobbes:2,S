Subject: [patch] s3c2412 support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/28/101

From: Koen Martens <kmartens@sonologic.nl>
Changes are:
- Added s3c2412-specific files to arch/arm/mach-s3c2410
- Added s3c2412 detection to arch/arm/mach-s3c2410/cpu.c
- Added CONFIG_CPU_S3C2412
- Added s3c2412 specific registers and register addresses to
  various regs-*.h files in include/asm-arm/arch-s3c2410
All changes are preliminary, final documentation is not yet available
from samsung. We did test on actual hardware, but outside the linux
kernel (due to limited number of actual chips we have available and
lack of proper PCB with serial lines exported).
Signed-off-by: Koen Martens <kmartens@sonologic.nl>
Have fun,
Koen Martens
