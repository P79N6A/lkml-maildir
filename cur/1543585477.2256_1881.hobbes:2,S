There is a dozen other processes that must not be killed.
Init is just a random example.

Last week I installed SuSE 7.1 somewhere.
During the install: "VM: killing process rpm",
leaving the installer rather confused.
(An empty machine, 256MB, 144MB swap, I think 2.2.18.)
Last month I had a computer algebra process running for a week.
Killed. But this computation was the only task this machine had.
Its sole reason of existence.
Too bad - zero information out of a week's computation.
(I think 2.4.0.)
Clearly, Linux cannot be reliable if any process can be killed
at any moment. I am not happy at all with my recent experiences.
