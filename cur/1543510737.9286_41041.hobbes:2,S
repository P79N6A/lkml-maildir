I've encountered the problem too; basically it's due to the different ways in
which the 2.2.x kernels detect the mouse vs the 2.0.x kernels.
To work around the problem, apply this patch for now:

     misc_register(&psaux_mouse);
(credits to Alan Cox, my own version of the workaround is a bit more convoluted)
I should get off my lazy bum and look more active into a 'real' fix or providing
a boot-time option for it!
