Say if blender is polling the mouse in the view rotate loop?  (If so, you 
should be able to just hold down the middle mouse to starve, without moving 
the mouse.)
Is this really a bug in the application?  Blender is interactive while rotating 
the view.  More CPU means more frames per second which gives the user a
better experience.  The CPU usage will drop down when the user releases the
middle mouse button.
(OK, in this specific case blender could update the screen on mouse move 
events, but what about the general case eg a 3d game, where the screen
is updated by eg monster ai?)
And how do you fix it?  Would sleep(0) in these loops do, or do you need to
select(...) on X?
CC me please on replys.
Thanks,
