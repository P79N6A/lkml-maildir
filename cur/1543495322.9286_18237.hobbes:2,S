I'd prefer writing to memory. Everything else COULD be unsafe.
Maybe if 
  - there's code to check if all unfinished processing on scsi/eide/... 
    adapters & disks is correctly terminated
  - there's a flag indicating where the oops occured - if a scsi driver 
    crashes, this interface should NEVER be used later without complete reset
Writing to main memory on block boundaries (1/4/16/64/256k), repeating as
often as possible, doing a soft reset and scanning at boot (verifying the
mem= option as it goes) ... would have another Good Thing (TM) too.
AND this should be the most easiest to implement.
just my 0.02$
