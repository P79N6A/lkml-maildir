I was running into this performance issue again:
Everything same as before, 2.6.24, CFQ scheduler, Seagate 7200.11
320GB SATA (SD11 firmware) on a quiescent and well-powered system:
# sync; echo 3 >/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches; dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/null
bs=128k count=1000
1000+0 records in
1000+0 records out
131072000 bytes (131 MB) copied, 2.24231 s, 58.5 MB/s
I found that tuning the AHCI SATA TCQ depth to 2 provides exactly the
performance we expect:
# echo 2 >/sys/block/sda/device/queue_depth
# sync; echo 3 >/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches; dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/null
bs=128k count=1000
1000+0 records in
1000+0 records out
131072000 bytes (131 MB) copied, 0.98503 s, 133 MB/s
depth 1: 132 MB/s
depth 2: 133 MB/s
depth 3: 69.1 MB/s
depth 4: 59.7 MB/s
depth 8: 54.9 MB/s
depth 16: 57.1 MB/s
depth 31: 58.0 MB/s
Very interesting interaction, and the figures are very stable. Could
this be a product of the maximum time the drive waits to coalesce
requests before acting on them? If so, how can we diagnose this, apart
from you guys getting one of these disks?
Thanks,
  Daniel
