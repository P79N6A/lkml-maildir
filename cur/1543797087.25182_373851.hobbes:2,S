OK, please attach the output of dmidecode (here or to #5692).
I have attached my acpidump there.
Bero, can you please test whether the ACPI hotkey driver would work for you?
If so, I'll remove the Acer Aspire 1500 entry.
If not, please attach the output of dmidecode too, we'll try to find out
how to differentiate between the laptops
Thanks,
