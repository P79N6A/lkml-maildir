Is this new with 2.6.10-rc1, or has it always been broken in an
ACPI-enabled kernel with acpi sharing an irq with e100?
I suspect this may be a bug in the e100 -- it may have enabled
interrupts before it has registered a handler.
Assuming it is a receive interrupt, you may be able to verify this by
plugging in the network cable after the system has probed e100 and see
if it works normally after that.
Also, you might try out the eepro100 driver to see if it behaves any
differently.
