mount -t ntfs -o loop file.sav-on-ext2-or-on-xfs[when using 2.4.18] /mnt

The test I did was the following [may I call that test ?]:
cd /mnt; mkdir /ntfs_on_ext3; cp -r * /ntfs_on_ext3
While copying, with or without debug, the system hangs, but top only reports
7 % cpu load.
Copying the files results in a input / output error.
It has never been an oops and actually 2.5.29 does _not_ hangup anymore!
Still it stops to copy the files and aborts.
I am currently retrying with debug enabled...

oops. forget that above. Oh yes, ntfs is really reporting much.
You can find the output at ftp.schottelius.org:/pub/tmp, it's about
600k compressed.
I am really happy that this time the cp did not hald my system!
Nico
p.s.: what was the maximal file size on ext3 ? I just gunzipped a 4gb
      file (the ntfs image the whole story is about), which could not
      be transfered through scp/ftp in this size...
