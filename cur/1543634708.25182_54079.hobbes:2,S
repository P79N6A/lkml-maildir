I think if you are mounting the remote filesystem (or otherwise using it in 
some stateful way), then it appears in driverfs at mount time. This is 
because it becomes important at that point - you now have a dependency on the 
underlying transport (the PCI bus better not be shut down before I get the 
dirty pages out over the network card to the storage array).
