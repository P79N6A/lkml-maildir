Hi,
I have a vanilla 2.2.18 that I patch Andrea Arcangeli's VM-global-7
patch (for 2.2.18pre25) on top, as well as I²C 2.5.4, the current
--12-09 IDE.2.2.18 patch and ReiserFS 3.5.28. So far, so good. If I now
patch serial 5.05 on top of that, the kernel itself detects devices, but
does nothing if it's to boot /sbin/init. ctrl-alt-del and Magic SysRq
are both functional and can reboot the machine.
Taking out either the VM-global-7 patch or the serial 5.05 update fixes
this.
I suspect that these patches are mutually incompatible.
Could somebody please have a look at this? I will test or provide more
information as requested.
