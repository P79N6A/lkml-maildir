Hmm, well it looks like it will work perfectly with the v850 (which
makes sense as it's mostly a copy of the i386 code).
What about request_irq/setup_irq?  The majority of architectures use
exactly the same code as i386 for these; a few do not, so perhaps this
is a case where a HAVE_ARCH_... define could be used.
[setup_irq even has this comment:
   /* this was setup_x86_irq but it seems pretty generic */
   int setup_irq(unsigned int irq, struct irqaction * new)
]
