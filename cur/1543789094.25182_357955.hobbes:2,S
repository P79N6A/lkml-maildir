Is this patch supposed to allow me to hot-plug/hot-eject my laptop in its
docking station ?
I have an IBM T41 and a docking station with extra IDE/PCI/PCMCIA bus-es on it.
I've tried for a long time to make them work hot, but till now, I could
not make them work.
I can only use the docking station if I boot in it.
Thanks,
Paul
