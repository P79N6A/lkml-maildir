I had the problem with the Intel Saturn II chipset used on the Asus SP3G.
The same problem was reported with the Saturn I on the SP3.
The bug manifests as occasional bus-master transfer data corruption.
The work-around was to change the Tulip PCI control register to use 
  8 longword cache alignment, 8 longword burst.
when the Tulip driver was run on a 486.
The old non-module work-around was
    if (x86 <= 4)
	  printk(KERN_INFO "%s: This is a 386/486 PCI system, setting cache "
			 "alignment to %x.\n", dev->name,
			 0x01A00000 | (x86 <= 4 ? 0x4800 : 0x8000));
I removed this code and replaced with the ability to set the variable "csr0"
as a module option.  There is no way to activate the fix with a built-in
driver.
