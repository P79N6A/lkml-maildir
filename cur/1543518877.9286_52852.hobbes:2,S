Note that, while i may have indirectly brought this issue up, never expected
that anybody would consider this something that could be quickly implemented,
without considering the consequences. However that did happen, and once the
seriously broken patches were being posted, and boldly declared as fully
functional complete implementations, I got worried for a while...
The system call i/f, being probably the most important kernel one, is not
something you can redesign once you realize it's broken.

In this case i'm quite sure everybody was using it only because it's the
fastest syscall around and its static nature makes it a perfect testcase.

phew. Actually the last few days convinced me there's no other way than the
blackbox solution. It might loose a few cycles, but i prefer that to the
support nightmare i for a while suspected linux was heading towards.

well, i wouldn't put it that way, looking at the details isn't bad in itself;
in fact it can help a lot when designing interfaces, and certainly never
hurts. Not loosing sight of the bigger issue is what's required.

i think there's some potential for libc<>kernel cooperation, many of
the libc stubs are very similar and might benefit from a bit more
kernel help. (prpbably nothing more than making sure these two do not
needlessly get in the way of eachover)

hmm, a few classes could work (eg 0-2/3-6args), but this depends on a
_lot_ of factors (aot which of the critical entries are specialcased,
whether the _internal_ handling can benefit,...)

ptrace is worth seriously looking at. Signal handling can be made to
work with almost any scheme, but ptrace is special. it alone probably
accounts for a ~10% overhead, maybe more, even when it is _not_ used
at all. for example it would be relativly trivial to speed up the fast
path by the number above, while slowing down ptrace (it has so much
overhead anyway that it wouldn't matter in RL). 
Hmm, one could think of keeping a count of all ptrace usage in the
system, so that during normal operation, when nothing is being
debugged, things would go a lot faster.
>  - other classes?
maybe. maybe some calls that are sufficiently special, but not critical
to performance can be moved away from the "normal" path, if that makes
it go faster (like iopl, execve, vm86)

it's important to get this right the first time though.

As i said above I now think that's the only available solution. Not so
much because of any technical reasons; i'm afraid the development model
forces this. And this is one of few areas where having several independent
(potentially conflicting) solutions would really hurt.
Does anybody work (or plans to in the near future) on this?
