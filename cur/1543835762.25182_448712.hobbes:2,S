Ok, I see what you're talking about.

This is unfortunately true. It maybe that my suggestion isn't going to
work in this scenario. I'll have to think about this more. I think that
either way you still have to extract information somewhere that there is
you're in a live RCU reader section anyways, either through an RCU read
side counter or some kind of mechanism like that (boosted priority or
ceiling can denote some use of RCU, as in a some kind of count, but this
is getting more complicated and remotely less useful) and still take tha
into account when you do priority inheritance.
I'll have to think about this more, but you are probably completely
correct and it might not be possible to priority boost an RCU read side
without some kind of explicit reader tracking in the task struct.
