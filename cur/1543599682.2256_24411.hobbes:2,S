Ok. I can agree with that. As a junior kernel hacker, I did not know about
this issue, and I agree that somebody with a bit more experience should
have reserved the next number. Sorry :-(
But, since I've gone through this ioctl reservation conflict twice now
(e2fsprogs and something having to do with XFS), I think this is a more
general problem.
As a side note, a copy of the second edition of "Linux Device Drivers" I
am using doesn't mention this idea of reserving ioctl numbers.
