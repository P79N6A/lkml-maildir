The problem with the prototype is that it's not always correct.
It's fine to pass non-"unsigned long *" pointers to set_bit, if you know
the pointers are otherwise aligned. Things like buffer bitmaps etc.
How does the patch look? If it has a lot of unnecessary casts, I don't
want it, but if the casts are only in things like ext2_setbit(), then that
might be ok..
