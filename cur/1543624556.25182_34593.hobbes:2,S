Your C800 works with local APIC enabled if APM is disabled? Cool.
This indicates that the DMI blacklisting rules in my dmi-apic-fixups
patch should be relaxed to permit local APIC use on Dell laptops,
IF APM is disabled in the BIOS. There's already a rule for that
(used for the MSI-6163 mb) so it's a trivial change.
