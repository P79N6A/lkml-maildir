This was in the context of 2.4.2-ac21. More of the thread,with no 
conclusive result, can be found at 
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0103.2/0906.html
Was there any resolution? Was the problem real, did it get fixed, and 
is it safe to turn on the local-APIC-based NMI ticker on a 2.4.9 SMP 
system? (I'm stuck with 2.4.9, actually Red Hat's 2.4.9-31, for 
external reasons.) What was the nature of the mysterious crashes?
Thanks.
