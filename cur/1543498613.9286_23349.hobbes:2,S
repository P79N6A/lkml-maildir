Sorry, this is the right answer to the wrong question; I'm aware of how the
situation works for that same IRQ, but that's not what I'm asking about.
I'm asking about nested dissimilar interrupts, not re-entered interrupts.
Like this:
Slow Interrupt A ISR entered (ie. no SA_INTERRUPT)
	Interrupt A already disabled in interrupt controller
	Other interrupts still enabled in controller and microprocessor
	----Interrupt B for unrelated device is asserted, ISR B entered
		Interrupt B disabled in interrupt controller
		Other interrupts still enabled in IC and CPU
	----Interrupt B finishes
	Stack unwound, interrupt A ISR resumes
Interrupt A ISR finishes
Is this possible?  It appears to be possible on x86, but not on Alpha (ie.
on Alpha in arch/alpha/kernel/irq.c, interrupt reporting is disabled in the
microprocessor prior to ISR execution).  In the x86 case, if it is
supported (as it appears to be), how deep can this happen?  Is it only
limited by available number of interrupts that can possibly fire before
they are all masked off?
