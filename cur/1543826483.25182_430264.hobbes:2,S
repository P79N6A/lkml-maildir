With the help of Khasim Syed, who happens to have access to the MMC
spec, we now know what's in the spec. Unfortunately, what's in there is
the same text that's in Russell's card specs, which state that only
WRITE_BL_LEN is supported.
However! In the simplified SD physical spec (which you can find on the
SDA home page), we can find:
4.3.2 2GByte Card
To make 2GByte card, the Maximum Block Length (READ_BL_LEN=WRITE_BL_LEN)
shall be set to
1024 bytes. But Block Length set by CMD16 shall be up to 512 bytes to
keep consistency with 512
bytes Maximum Block Length cards (Less than and equal 2GByte cards).
It even has an example with WRITE_BL_PARTIAL=0, still setting block
length to 512. Now I know this is SD and not MMC, but the debug dump
from Serge earlier seems to suggest that MMC cards follow the same rule.
Even though this breaks the MMC spec, my vote is for 512 bytes at all
times. If the entire industry decided to violate the spec, I don't see
much gain in being stubborn here.
