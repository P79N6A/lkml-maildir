	I tried latest mount (2.9z I believe) and trying both

Yes, sorry - I believed the RELEASE-NOTES of e2fsprogs-1.15
but should have checked the kernel source.
So, we have a flaw: the RELEASE-NOTES are incorrect,
and a bug: either 2.0.* kernels can do bad things
to a r/w mounted ext2 filesystem with sparse superblocks
in which case it is a kernel bug to allow the r/w remount,
or the r/w remount under 2.0.* is harmless, in which case
it is a mke2fs bug to set a bit in s_feature_ro_compat.
Anyway mount is not involved. I wouldnt like to teach mount
to mount readonly first and then to do a remount.
