I would love to hear it! No irony intended, I really would. Because I
think both of us agree something should be done about this otherwise.

This is fundamentally interesting. Should the vendor make changes to suit
Linux, or should it be the other way around? I for one say that Linux must
be as good or better than other OSs if it wants to compete for commercial
use. Remember that Linux claims to support 3GB of process virtual memory.
I would say this is twisting with numbers...

Yes, this is true. Or why not have both a better allocation strategy and
have a more intelligent libc? But a malloc() that uses mmap() and
internally fragments the memory would be perfect, I guess!

Once again, I think the vendor/programmer should be free to choose for
himself whether he wants to use mmap() or malloc(). The kernel should not
force him/her in any direction.
