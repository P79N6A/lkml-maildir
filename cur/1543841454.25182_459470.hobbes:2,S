Subject: [PATCH] NOMMU: Permit ptrace to ignore non-PROT_WRITE VMAs in NOMMU mode
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/31/233

From: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>
Permit ptrace to modify a section that's non-shared but is marked unwritable,
such as is obtained by mapping the text segment of an ELF-FDPIC executable
binary with into a binary that's being ptraced[*].
[*] Under NOMMU conditions ptrace causes read-only MAP_PRIVATE mmaps to become
    totally private copies because if a private mapping was actually shared
    then the debugging setting breakpoints in it would potentially crash
    other processes.
This is done by using the VM_MAYWRITE flag rather than the VM_WRITE flag when
deciding whether to permit a write.
Without this patch a debugger can't set breakpoints in the mapped text sections
of executables that are mapped read-only private, even if the mmap() syscall
has taken a private copy because PT_PTRACED is set.
In addition, VM_MAYREAD is used instead of VM_READ for similar reasons.
