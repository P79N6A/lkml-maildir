I just meant it as a short piece of pseudo-code (and I got the
inialization syntax wrong anyway, but I'm sure you get the
idea) .. of course you'd need to put the actual initialization
in <asm/pci.h> and fill in the needed arch-specific things.
Since its only meant to be used by pci_alloc_consistent and friends
it probably doesn't need a full assortment of fields, though.

Look at it this way - right now the NULL pointer is saying two
different semi-related things:
  * this memory is for a non-PCI, but pci-ish device
  * this memory needs to be within the ISA DMA range
If we passed in dma_mask as a seperate paramater to
pci_alloc_consitent this wouldn't be an issue, but since the
value is part of the *pci_dev I think we should pass _some_
sort of token in to explicitly state where we want the
allocation.
