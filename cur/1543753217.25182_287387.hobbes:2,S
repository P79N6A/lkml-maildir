I'm nowhere near being able to actually do a security audit.  I
understand what an audit is, I understand what causes vulnerabilities,
but I'd probably only be able to see the most obvious things (like
strcpy(a,"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa") into a[4]).
If I had a few more years of experience, college out of the way, a good
job, and had some of my other projects moving along, maybe. . . .
