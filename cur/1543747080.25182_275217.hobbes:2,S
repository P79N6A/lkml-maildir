If I understand correctly the above means "include/* userland breakage 
problems open for fixing" and the "kernel includes aren't for userland" part 
is obsolete?

Potential breakage is mostly a non issue - since vanilla kernel headers are 
mostly useless for userland anyway, one must either patch them or use my 
headers (fedora's?). As for my headers - I can always provide a compatibility 
layer that will look like the old tree but in fact use the new tree.* And 
that also means application specific hacks not to break some app (I'm doing 
that now anyway, so no difference).
I'm *really* for fixing the header problem once and for all one way (lifting 
the 'kernel includes aren't for userland' ban) or the other (making a 
separate, userland available part that glibc and other apps can use cleanly). 
Maintaining a separate tree of those headers ain't much fun and it would be 
nice if I could quit doing that some time in the future.
* Fluent and (mostly) painless migration guaranteed or your money back.
