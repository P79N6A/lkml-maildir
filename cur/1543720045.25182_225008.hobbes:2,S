Well ... we agree on the "grungy" part ... ;).
Your flavor has the same problem as I saw with the static inline nested
inside a #define macro flavor.  On i386, SMP, gcc 3.3.2, when the
cpu_isset() is part of a for-loop control, both the normal and 'grungy'
flavors cost one extra jump instruction, whereas the flavor I ended up
using places one chunk of code more optimally, saving a hard jump
instruction.
This saves 196 bytes of kernel text space.
If you can show me a type checked cpu_isset() that generates code
as tight as what I ended up using, let me know.
Or if you would prefer I spend the 196 bytes to get this type checked,
that's worthy of consideration as well.
