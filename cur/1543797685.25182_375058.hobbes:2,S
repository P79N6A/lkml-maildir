Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Link lxdialog with mconf directly
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

  The following series revives one three years old patch, turning lxdialog
to a library and linking it directly to mconf, making menuconfig nicer and
things in general quite simpler and cleaner.
  The first two patches make slight adjustements to kbuild in order to make
liblxdialog possible. The third patch does the libification itself and
appropriate modifications to mconf.c.
  PS: Sorry for the blank covermail I've sent before. StGIT still seems
to behave, er.. erratically.
