Right, but you're not testing the entire overhead (including kernel-space
time) of the syscall, are you?  You're assuming more syscalls == slower.
What if you could have one syscall that would fill out a maximum of x
event structures for you and return how many it actually filled out?  You
could completely avoid the process of constructing and scanning the
select sets in userspace, and the same for the kernel.  The kernel
wouldn't have to poll anything, because it would already be queued up
when an event occurs.
This has got to be faster than using select(), no?  There is no wasted
time testing filedescriptors for events and scanning lists, you just tell
the kernel to fill out a set of preallocated structures with event data
that it already has available.
