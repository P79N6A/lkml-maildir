The window for 2.6.23 has now closed and your position on this is clear. I've 
been supporting this code in -mm for 21 months since 16-Oct-2005 without any 
obvious decision for this code forwards or backwards.
I am no longer part of your operating system's kernel's world; thus I cannot 
support this code any longer. Unless someone takes over the code base for 
swap prefetch you have to assume it is now unmaintained and should delete it.
Please respect my request to not be contacted further regarding this or any 
other kernel code.
