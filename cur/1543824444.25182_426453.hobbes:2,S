I read online in multiple places that the largest allocation groups 
should get is 4g, so I made mine 2g. However, having said that, I did 
test with different allocation sizes and the effect was not that 
dramatic. I will retest again though, just to verify.
I was also thinking that the more AGs the better since I do a lot of 
parallel reads/writes... granted it doesn't change the file system all 
that much (the file only grows or get existing blocks get modified), so 
I am not sure if the number of AGs matter, does it?

Sorry, I meant that moving the Inode size to 2k (over 256bytes) gave me 
a sizeable increase in performance... I assume that is because the 
extent map can be smaller now (since blocks are much larger, less blocks 
to keep track of). Of course, ideal would be to have InodeSize be large 
and blocksize to be 32k... but I hit the limits on both...

On my production servers the file is 2TB, but on this testing enviroment 
I have, the file is only 767G of a 819G partition... This is sufficient 
to tell because the performance is already hindered alot even at 767G, 
going to 2TB just makes it worse...

I set it by hand. I rebuilt the partition and am now copying over the 
file again to see the results...

I tried this a couple of times, but it seemed to wedge the machine... I 
would do: 1) touch a file (just to create it), 2) do the above command 
which would then show effect in du, but the file size was still 0 3) I 
then opened that file (without O_TRUNC or O_APPEND) and started to write 
out to it. It would work fine for a few minutes but after about 5 or 7GB 
the machine would freeze... nothing in syslog, only a brief message on 
console about come cpu state being bad...

stripe unit is 64k, array is a RAID5 with 14 disks, so I say sw=13 (one 
disk is parity). I set this when I made the array, though it doesn't 
seem to matter much either.

we have plenty of memory on the machines, shouldn't be an issue... I am 
a little cautious about moving to a new kernel though...
