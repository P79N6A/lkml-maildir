   Basically you can de-stroke a drive with what you let the OS/FS report.
   Once this is done there is no way any FS can get to the stuff beyond what
   it knows about.
I'm not sure what you mean by "de-stroke" here.
   100 sectors total drive size.
   OS/FS knows about 90 sectors and can only do up to 90.
   Bypass Layer with direct access will see the stuff from 91-100.
OK, fine, with your special hacks it's possible to use some extra
sectors.  But is it actually safe to use sectors 91-100?  These wouldn't
happen to be the blocks used for doing bad block sparing, would they?
