One of the other places things look is in the /lib/modules/$VERSION/
directory.  I find it helpful to keep System.map and the kernel itself
there, and nuke all copies out of / and /boot.  That keeps everything
associated with a particular kernel together and avoids all manner of
grief and extra maintenance.
(Tell lilo.conf about the new paths and rerun lilo!)
