Subject: [PATCH] Sample fix for hyperthread exploit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

With respect to the recently publicised theoretical exploit for tasks running 
on hyperthread siblings, we already have in our hyperthreading code the 
ability to suspend running of tasks on siblings based on their behaviour. We 
could extend that if so desired as a plug for this theoretical exploit. We 
could suspend tasks that run on siblings based on their uid to prevent 
another user from being able to instrument cache misses from another user's 
task. Attached is a sample patch to do just that. It is my understanding that 
this exploit is not deemed significant risk anyway, and the attached solution 
would cost us in throughput if multiple users' tasks are running 
concurrently, but would still be better than disabling hyperthreading. This 
patch is more for discussion than inclusion, and is otherwise untested.
Comments?
