  Hi, all. Here's a perverse problem: when the screen blanks (text
console) with 2.4.18, the machine hangs. No ping response, no magic
SysReq response. I didn't have this problem with 2.4.7.
The command I used to configure screen blanking was:
setterm -blank 10 -powerdown 0
This is an Athalon 850 MHz on a Gigabyte GA-7ZM motherboard.
I managed to waste a few hours chasing this, wondering why the machine
hung a while after boot. Of course, I first blamed the jobs that were
started on it soon after boot. Turns out the jobs are not to blame!
