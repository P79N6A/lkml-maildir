Thanks for the info. I took a look at Documentation/hpet.txt and drivers/char/hpet.c
and see that hpet_mmap is implemented in the driver but nothing hpet.txt indicates
what is being mapped.
Could you point me to any other documentation? I did find the following:
http://www.intel.com/hardwaredesign/hpetspec_1.pdf
Are you aware of any example user code that uses the mmap capability of hpet?
Thanks,
Wink
