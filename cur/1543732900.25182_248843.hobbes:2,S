the -R3 patch has this feature:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.9-rc1-bk4-R3
 
you can enable it via enabling CONFIG_LATENCY_TRACE and doing:
  echo 3 > /proc/sys/kernel/trace_enabled
it's all automatic from this point on: tracing will happen nonstop and
any assert or crash that prints the process stack will also print the
last 100 trace entries. Sample output:
 Call Trace:
  [<c0160401>] sys_munmap+0x61/0x80
  [<c010520d>] sysenter_past_esp+0x52/0x71
 Last 100 trace entries:
 00000001: zap_pmd_range+0xe/0x90  <= (unmap_page_range+0x55/0x80)
 00000001: stop_trace+0x8/0x20  <= (bust_spinlocks+0x20/0x60)
 00000001: bust_spinlocks+0xe/0x60  <= (die+0xbc/0x2a0)
 [... 97 more trace entries ...]
Please capture and mail the first 'extended' oops that triggers
(secondary followup traces are probably just side-effects of the crash),
it could give us clues about where the bug is.
