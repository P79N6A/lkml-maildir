Yes, I saw those. But they're really just "magic numbers" that userland
expects to see. In my opinion, the constant values should be inlined
into that compat code. Or, at best, moved into the sparc compat header
files.

Doesn't look like it to me. PIPE_BUFFERS stands for something else
entirely, if my understanding is correct. PIPE_BUF is the one that
"guarantees" atomicity.
