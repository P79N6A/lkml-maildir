Subject: RH5.2 won't install on Cyrix

Hello,
I have a Cyrix based machine and I am trying to install Red Hat 5.2 on
it. Every time I attempt to run the installer from either a floppy or
a bootable CD-ROM, it crashes and restarts the machine whenever it
reaches the "second level setup" message. I have tried disabeling
both extrnal and internal caches as well as Plug'n'Play BIOS support.
Nothing worked. Could someone with a Cyrix 6x86 machine provice me
with a good kernel with no SCSI suppot (I do not have SCSI)? I'd
be very thankful.
