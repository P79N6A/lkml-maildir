Hrm, can you give me an example of where this would be needed, where the
inheritable mechanism won't work?  Of course, you may be referring to the
current kernel hack to make 'root' stuff work, in which case this is a
compatibility measure for use during transistion to a system-wide
implementation of our capability lists?  So the goal would eventually be
'no bits survive'?

But eventually this will be properly handled in inheritable during
starup/login?

OK, so you're in favor of a model where the admin has a variety of
choices?  I'm mostly cool with this, except on the point of storing uid
info in the executable; of course, there's no reason you _have_ to store
uid info in _every_ cap-enabled binary.  For setuid-root marked
executables, I can see storing r/euid (since that info is otherwise not
available in the fs).
So yes, I can certainly work with a hybrid solution that gives me choices.
cheers,
