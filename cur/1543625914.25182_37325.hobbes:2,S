what's the point if you're just going to get signal delivery when you
least want it, even when malloc returns non-NULL?  it could even be due to
stack growth which the compiler is under control of and has no exception
mechanism available.  i personally prefer to take the signal and exit,
it's guaranteed to work in all cases.  (hence, apache-1.3 and other
multiprocess daemon superiority over threaded and event-driven code, tee
