i'm a big fan of doing what i need to do and getting the hell out ;)
in this case:
mv include/linux/ufs_fs.h fs/ufs/
git rm include/linux/ufs_fs.h
git add fs/ufs/ufs_fs.h
if the ufs_fs.h threw complaints from checkpatch.pl, it did so originally 
before i touched it, and i leave it up to the maintainer and/or someone who 
wants to look at it.
