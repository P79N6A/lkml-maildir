That sounds fine.  So, in the netif_receive_skb function, we'd now have
something like:
	if (skb->dev->netpoll_rx && netpoll_rx(skb)) {
		kfree_skb(skb);
		return NET_RX_DROP;
	}
I removed the test for skb->dev->poll, since this is the NAPI code path, I
think it should always be present, right?
And then at the top of the netpoll_rx routine:
	if (!(skb->dev->netpoll_rx & NETPOLL_RX_ENABLED))
		goto out;
The routine, as before, returns the value of trapped.  And now,
netpoll_poll would do this:
	if(np->dev->poll && test_bit(__LINK_STATE_RX_SCHED, &np->dev->state)) {
		np->dev->netpoll_rx |= NETPOLL_RX_TRAPPED;
		if (trapped)
			np->dev->poll(np->dev, &budget);
		else {
			trapped = 1;
			np->dev->poll(np->dev, &budget);
			trapped = 0;
		}
		np->dev->netpoll_rx &= ~NETPOLL_RX_TRAPPED;
	}
Is this more in line with what you had in mind?  One thing I would consider
changing, here, is having netpoll_set_trap take a struct netpoll argument.
That way, we could have netpoll_set_trap manipulate the NETPOLL_RX_TRAPPED
bit.  This would make the trap specific to each interface, but I think that
may be desirable.
