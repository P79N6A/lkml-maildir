I will try to duplicate your problem here. I have 2.3.12-pre1 up for about
11 hours here on an SMP system running distributed-net and bonnie
filesystem benchmarks (usually run two at a time on the same filesystem to
try to break something). So far it is holding up pretty well. One thing I
have noticed is the distributed.net key blocks tend to vary in size and
therefore processing time:
[Jul 24 18:09:17 UTC] Completed one RC5 block B341F9EA:F0000000 (1*2^28 keys)
0.00:03:32.07 - [1,265,783.83 keys/sec]
[Jul 24 18:14:59 UTC] Completed one RC5 block B3350A61:50000000 (8*2^28 keys)
0.00:28:14.56 - [1,267,274.58 keys/sec]
So there I have one block that completed in three minutes and another in
28 but the blocksizes were very different (the number of keys/sec
processed were about the same). So the thing to look for is not time per
block but the number of keys per second.
You might want to try pre-2.3.12-1 since it is supposed to fix some known
problems with 2.3.11
