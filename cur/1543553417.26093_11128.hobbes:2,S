Ok, something happend to the tulip driver in the recent testN kernels.
I haven't found a reason why it happens and I can't easily reproduce it
but what happens is noted on the subject line.
I have three machines now that do this.  It's unfixable until reboot (I
don't have these as modules).
I have a suspicion that it's triggered by large amounts of traffic.  My
brother feels he is able to trigger it repeatedly by doing big transfers
between a w9x box and a linux box.
