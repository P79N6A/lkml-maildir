Correct, cpuinfo tells me it is a Pentium III (Coppermine), and the apic
flag is not net.

2.5.57 - wavelan worked
2.5.58 - couldn't recognize the card
2.5.59 - Oops during boot when loading modules
2.5.60 - wavelan broken
2.5.61/62 - skipped these
2.5.63 - wavelan still broken
2.5.64 wasn't released yet, and noone seems to have reported a similar
problem. So I went back, trying 2.5.58 with enough patches from .59 that
it could load the card, and it worked. Then I tried 2.5.59 with just
enough patches to avoid the Oops during module loading and it didn't
work.
I am running 2.5.64 without Local APIC support and it seems to work.
I'll rebuild with Local APIC, which clearly shouldn't make a difference
because my CPU doesn't have one and see if the problem returns.
