Sad. This is not too uncommon, but yeah, it's really sad that we cannot 
use "const" (as a compiler type safety marker) together with section 
definitions (to get it put in special init sections).
Bartlomiej - I don't think we need to revert the whole commit, but all 
those "static const xyz __devinitdata = { .." things probably do need to 
have the const removed, even if it would be otherwise correct ;(
