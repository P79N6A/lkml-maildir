The multicast hash is written into a nic register with
	set_bit(crc(...),mc_list);
	...
	out{b,w,l}(mc_list[i],ioaddr);
set_bit_le only helps for outb. My patch uses set_bit_16 and set_bit_32.
Another option would be
	set_bit_le(crc(...),mc_list)
	...
	out{w,l}(le{16,32}_to_cpu(mc_list[i]),ioaddr);
but I think set_bit_{8,16,32,64} are the better solution.
Obviously we could move them into a header file.
