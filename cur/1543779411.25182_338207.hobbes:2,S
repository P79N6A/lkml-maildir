ic. Sorry if the question is stupid, but is it bad not to reach
35MB/sec?

Well, bare metal restores are rare, and if you need to do one, IMHO one
full restore and six incrementals (worst case, and with one full backup
a week) are not that painful. Very IMHO of course. You could lessen the
pain with incrementals_since_last_full (can't remember the correct term
ATM).
If you go with weekly fulls, you can almost have a single system per
day streaming a full backup to your backupserver.

Yes, I understand.

According to the docs it is just 'enable' or 'disable'. I remember raid
controllers (Intel?) which also have 'write through' or 'write back'.
That was what I was looking for, but no such thing it seems.

Yes, but if you can lift the performance at some point, it might get
acceptable. You could for example also try a raid0 stripe across the 7
disks.
