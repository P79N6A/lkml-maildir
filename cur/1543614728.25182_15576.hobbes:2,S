Actually, if you use the mdbm code, you can have a server process which
reads the data, stashes it in the db, touchs ./i_am_done, and exits.
"client" processes do a 
	while (!exists("i_am_done")) usleep(100000);
	m = mdbm_open("db", O_RDONLY, 0, 0);
	val = mdbm_fetch_str(m, "key");
	etc.
No sockets, no back and forth, runs at mmap speed.
If you tell me what the data looks like that needs to be in the DB, i.e.,
how to get it, I'll code you up the "server" side.
