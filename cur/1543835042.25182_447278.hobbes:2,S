Dumb thought: would it make sense to add an O_CAREFUL flag to open(), to 
disable side effects?  It seems that a number of devices have this issue 
and one have to jump through weird hoops to configure them.  Obviously, 
a file descriptor obtained with O_CAREFUL may not be fully functional, 
at the device driver's option.
For a conventional file, directory, or block device O_CAREFUL is a 
no-op.  For ttys it would typically behave similar to O_NONBLOCK 
followed immediately by a fcntl to clear the nonblock flag.
