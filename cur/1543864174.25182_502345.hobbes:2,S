Yeah, I spent a frustrating two days with crosstool, managed to eke a
number of cross-compilers out of it, but it took a *lot* of experimentation
with gcc, glibc and binutils versions to get combinations which actually
work.  Good luck ;)
There used to be someone who had a full suite, and who regularly published
cross-compile results, but he stopped 6-12 months ago and I forget who that
clever person was?
