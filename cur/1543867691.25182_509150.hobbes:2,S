It is not black and white: You are the one who is using Linux; not the
other way.
In other words, you use Linux freely and don't help in any way;
however, you come to demand things and criticize hundreds of persons
who colaborated here.

projects/companies like yours using their free work, without any kind
of feedback. Some others don't care, but they could in the future, as
it is their code, and that is your risk.
