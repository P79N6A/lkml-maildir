   with this, the file failed to compile -- the kernel compiles fine
   with it added back.
Are you sure you didn't mis-patch your tree?
There is only one line in the include you say needs to be added back,
it is a declaration for a function.  That function was removed in a
set of changes, so I cannot see how this include line can make any
difference in whether the tree builds are not.
Even if the declaration from the header file is there, the function no
longer exists in the tree and nothing should reference it anymore :-)
Here try this from your linux/ tree;
bash$ egrep x25_proto_init `find . -type f -name "*.[ch]"`
If that command prints anything, you have mis-patched your tree
when going to test10-pre4.
BTW, you could have eliminated some of the mystery by showing the
exact errors that occur due to this problem you see. :-)
