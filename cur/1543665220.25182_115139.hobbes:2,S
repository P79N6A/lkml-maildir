Yes.  We have had some reports of problems with POSIX timers and I
suspect this might be the reason (though I don't know what the exact
code-base was that the person reporting the problem was using).

Yes, that would be better.  According to Uli, a 32-bit timer_t is fine
as far as the standards are concerned.  That's good.

Such code may be OK correctnesswise, but to avoid wasting space, it's
clearly better to list larger members first.
