The lock is lost.  The same thing would happen with locks completely
implemented in userspace.
I don't see that the kernel should do anything about this.  If a 
thread is killed with predudice (i.e. without pthread_cancel) then
there are all sorts of cleanups that won't happen.  Having the
kernel automatically unlock the locks doesn't help much, since
the data structures are quite likely in an inconsistent state.
