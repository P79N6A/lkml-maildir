| That's one really wierd looking backtrace. What else was that
| machine up to at the time ?
Mostly I was just testing the ppa driver, so mostly "nothing."
As I said:
Wrote some files to a Zip ppa device, did sync and umount:
Then I exited xfce and saw those messages.
X and xfce (window manager) were loaded and some console windows
were open.  Nothing else other than daemons.
