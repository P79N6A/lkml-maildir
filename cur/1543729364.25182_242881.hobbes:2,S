Hi Andrew.
The following two patches can be dropped from -mm. The functionality has
moved to scripts/mksysmap
handle-undefined-symbols.patch
  Fail if vmlinux contains undefined symbols
sparc32-ignore-undefined-symbols-with-3-or-more-leading-underscores.patch
  sparc32: ignore undefined symbols with 3 or more leading underscores
On the topic of undefined symbols only certain ARM tool-chains
actually have this problem.
Russell - would it be possible to move the check to arch/arm/Makefile?
Assuming people always build zImage or one of the other arch specific targets.
This check have so far caused much more pain than it ought to do - so
if we could move it to where it really matters would be better.
	Sam
