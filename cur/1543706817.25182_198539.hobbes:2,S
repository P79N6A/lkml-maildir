Perhaps you are issuing non purely sequential IO.  The card firmware does
some 
reodering, but at some point it will cause performance degradation.  Can you
try 
kernel 2.6 w/xfs? 
Also, in my experience, the 'raw io' interface doesn't issue any
asynchronous IO.  The
card _definately_ needs asynchronous IO posted to it or you will not get
good results
because you won't get all the drives busy.

And this sort of things is what I find with raw writes to the model of 
drive I'm using.  However, it seems that there must be some issue with 
the 3ware 7000-2 which is killing performance, or the way the Linux 
kernel is dealing with this sorta-SCSI device.
The WD1200JB should get like 30-40 megs/sec, but when being accessed 
through the 3ware, I get 10-16 megs/sec.
What could the 3ware be doing?
