Anyone running xosview with SMP and 2.0.37? I can't get xosview to show
the CPU load for both processors. It shows two processors under 2.2.x.
I know the system is registering two processors under 2.0.37 from dmesg,
and /proc/cpuinfo lists two processors but /proc/stat lists only one (?)
Tweaks to the proc filesystem needed?
