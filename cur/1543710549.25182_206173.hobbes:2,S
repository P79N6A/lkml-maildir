This part makes the problem so simple. If this is acceptable, then we
have many choices. Since we won't have many mms in the anonmm list,
I don't think we will have any search complexity problems. If we really
worry again about search complexity, we can consider using prio_tree
(adds 16 bytes per vma - we cannot share vma.shared.prio_tree_node).
The prio_tree easily fits for anonmm after linus-mremap-simplification.
