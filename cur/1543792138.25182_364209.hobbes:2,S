Hi All,
       Have you ever met a problem that "ip_dst_cache" is going beyond 8192 sometimes? After sometimes, I am getting the "dst_cache_overflow" messages and "out of memory" in the device.
  I am using Linux 2.4.17 with a BogoMips device. Please let me know that somebody had already faced this issue earlier and any solution found.
The traffic passing through the device is online audio/video sessions and Bit Torent sometimes.
Thank you very much in advance for all of your help/advice.
Thanks
Joji
