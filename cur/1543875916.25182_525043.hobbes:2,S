First, I think you can read the book named "Kernel Projects for
Linux". It's a good book although it's outdated.
Second, in fact, I am also a college student and also want to find a
suitable and real task in linux kernel for me to work on. KJ doesn't
help much. ;-p
And I am wondering why linux kernel didn't attend Google Summer of
Code? Andrew, I hear you are in Google now. Can you tell me the
reason? Thanks very much!
Have fun!
