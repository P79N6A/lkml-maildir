For people interested in "s2io" 10GbE driver, the programming manual for
Xframe-I 10GbE Adapter 
is now available at ftp: ns1.s2io.com user: "linuxdocs" password: "HALdocs"
The relatively small delta between sw-compatible Xframe-II and Xframe-I is
not covered in the document,
but the current driver supports both adapters. Patches for the extra
Xframe-II features will be added over time; 
One of them (UDP Send Offload) was posted earlier today.
