Hi, 
If I understand Documentation/early-userspace/README correctly it should
be possible to solve the "unable to open an initial console" problem by
using a file like 
dir /dev 0755 0 0
nod /dev/console 0600 0 0 c 5 1
nod /dev/null 0600 0 0 c 1 3
dir /root 0700 0 0
and let CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE point to that file. The gpio archive is
built correctly with that, but my kernel doesn't seem to use it. 
Is anything else needed to use an initrd, like a command line argument?
My kernel boots from a nfs partition, so it sets nfsroot=... 
As I still get the "unable to open an initial console" message it looks
like the initramfs is not extracted, mounted or however that works.
