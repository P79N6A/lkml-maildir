Tom,
A co-worker made the following observation (I'm paraphrasing):
	...this proposal does not deal with the Error Reporting ECN.
	For example, they do not show the advisory non-fatal bit in
	the correctable error status register.
I believe he is referring to the "Error Clarifications ECN":

Looks like all PCI-E ECNs are available [just not the original docs :^( ]:
