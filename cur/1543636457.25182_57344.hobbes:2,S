I think I'm missing a part of this, the "a snapshot is created" sounds a
lot like "here a miracle occurs." Where is this snapshot saved? And how do
you take it in one sec regardless of f/s size? Is this one of those
theoretical things which requires two mirrored copies of the f/s so you
will still have RAID-1 after you break one? Or are changes journaled
somewhere until the snapshot is transferred to external media? And how do
you force applications to stop with their files in a valid state?
