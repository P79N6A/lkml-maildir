Just feedback for the true kernel gods:
I've announced it probably all to often.
But 2.6.1[34]* kernels aren't stable for me.
Where 2.6.12-mm1 stays up for >> 3 weeks the latest kernels barfs:
reboot   system boot  2.6.14-rc2-git5  Mon Sep 26 16:58          (05:44)
[crash]
reboot   system boot  2.6.14-rc2-git3  Sat Sep 24 05:14       (2+11:42)
[crash]
