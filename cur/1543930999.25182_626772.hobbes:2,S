I follow the discussion, actually, and wanted to ask someone to look
closer if it's appropriate to use __blk_end_request() here.
My understanding was, blk_end_request() is the same thing, only
takes the queue lock. But then, should I refactor ub so that it
calls __blk_end_request if request function ends with an error
and blk_end_request if the end-of-IO even is processed? If not,
and the above is sufficient, why have blk_end_request at all?
