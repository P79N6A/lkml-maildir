Please let's not beautify the output: this would make diffing and grepping 
harder. It's easy to pipe the simple, line oriented format through a 
formatting filter if necessary.
The output could be made more readable by converting the "x#" prefix to C 
keywords (struct, union, etc.). I didn't do this because that would introduce 
parse problems, and constructing dependency graphs from the dump files would 
become tricky.
