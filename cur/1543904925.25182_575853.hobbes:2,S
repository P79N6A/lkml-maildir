That would make sense.
Lee's error is a hardware FIFO overrun which could occur
if the FIFO is being disabled as described in your
link (by trying to set the uart type with setserial).
Since the tty flow control is only triggered
by the line discipline in response to ldisc
buffer levels and not hardware FIFO overruns,
you would never see any flow control action
as reported by Lee.
