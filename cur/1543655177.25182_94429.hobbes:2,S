Part of the flavor of the experimentation was to stop throttling things
to death and back again and then to death again and then some, so I
wasn't terribly concerned about performance per-se.

Well, not entirely, tiobench can only handle 256 or 512 threads in a
since invocation so a number of them were run in parallel, spread
across a bunch of disks and directories.

Ah, but there is! I'm supposed to fix it myself. =)
At any rate, there were more problems floating around beneath it, like
various odd things using contig_page_data (I think buffer.c got fixed)
and OOM handling and data structure proliferation issues arising from
temporary allocations (e.g. poll wait tables, pathname buffers) held
over processes sleeping.

Well, see the above. It actually did make a difference; I was able to
get a good deal of blockage out by just jacking up the wait table and
request queue size.
