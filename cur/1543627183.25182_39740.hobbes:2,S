that's equivalent with the big difference it will waste many nr_task
times more ram, you'd need to reserve some ram in each task-buffer for
the nr_irqs*(bufsize+1) nested printk. So for every task in the system
you wouldn't have only the overhead of bufsize but bufsize*(nr_irqs+2).
It doesn't sound a good idea to me. remember all irqs can be nested. The
kernel stack is just unsafe enough against nested irq (not anymore on
x86-64 luckily), printk should have a guaranteed bufsize instead. It
would be pointless to make printk robust against \n and overflowing
trivially with nested irq, then you'd be unreliable again.

Doing the check at runtime would be better, it will catch binary-only
module bugs and drivers out of the kernel bugs too. It should be
possible to disable the debugging feature with an #ifdef though.
But again, the above is all assuming we will change it, but I'm not
suggesting to change printk, I think atomicity printk-against-printk is
enough because of the non-segfaulting-human-parsing and because of the
low rate and in turn near zero probability for races (so basically zero
wasted time while reading the logs).
An high bandwith logging channel were such race starts to matter could
be built with PF_NETLINK or something like that, without using printk,
you need to store the plenty of data into a file and read it later, all
the console stuff is overhead for such a load, printk isn't high
bandwith in production, also think all the serial consoles out there.
