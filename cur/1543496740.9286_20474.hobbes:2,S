I am getting similar behaviour with lockups, but I have identified the cause.
I have a VIA MVP3 chipset.
On my older VIA chipsets, I would get lots of error messages during boot, but nothing bad would happen.  (Turning off UDMA with the -d switch in hdparm fixed the problem.)  With the new chipset, whenever I write alot of data to the hard drive (by, say, installing Civ:Call to Power), the system locks up hard.
At first I thought it was an X server error.  I ran into the same problem though untarring a huge file.  (Same game mentioned actually...)  The solution is `hdparm -d 0 /dev/hda`.  (Now if I could just remember to put it into rc.d somewhere...)
As a further warning...  Civ:Call to Power is a great hurking timesink and to be avoided if you want to get any code written.  (It is also very hard to play on a laptop on the bus.)
