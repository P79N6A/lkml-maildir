I think all you need to do is reload the code-segment register
and you end up flushing caches in ix86.
#
#   This forces a cache-line refill by reloading the code-segment
#   segment register. This would normally slow things down. However,
#   if I put this at the start of a procedure that suffers a cache-line
#   refill within the procedure, it is possible to speed things up.
#
.section	.text
.global		cflush	
.type		cflush,@function
cflush: pushl	%cs		# Put code segment on the stack
	pushl	$goto		# Put offset on the stack
	lret			# Do a 'long' return (reloads cs)
goto:	ret
.end
