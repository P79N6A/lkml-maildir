It seems reasonable to me that if no notifier callback exists for the
device (i.e. nobody has claimed it), you fail.  If someone is logged in but
is not at the console, then you eventually time out and fail.  None of this
seems worse than current behavior.
But this has wandered off topic for this list, since the precise behavior
is a user space problem.
