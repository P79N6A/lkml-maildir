True, this would be nice, but how would the driver know to bind to a new
device, if it isn't rebuilt, and doesn't know about the new id that was
just added?  In the current scheme of driver matching to devices, I
don't see how this could be done.
Not to say I would not want to see this changed to allow this to happen,
I'm very tired of telling USB Palm users to get a new kernel version
just because a single device id was added which their new device has.
thanks,
