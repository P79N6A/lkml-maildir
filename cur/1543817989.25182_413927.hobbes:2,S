Any hope in hell of getting this fixed? It's been broken for too long to 
remember. IIRC the problem is that on a read which hits EOF, instead of 
returning partial data read and no error, the status returned is just 
some "didn't work" variant and the partial read is lost. I also seem to 
remember that if the length of the ISO was a multiple of a magic number, 
32k, or the metric hexadecimal phase of the moon, you got a clean EOF.
As you say, ide-scsi fixes this, if the people who don't like it would 
make the alternatives work right it wouldn't be an issue...
Thanks for the info.
