Thank you for your very quick reply.

> Can you try the attached patch?
The problem was not solved.
When I pressed the bar key on JP 106 keyboard, the output of "showkey
-k" is
keycode   0 press
keycode   1 release
keycode  54 release
keycode   0 release
keycode   1 release
keycode  54 release
The scancode does not change. Before applying your patch to the
original kernel, the output was
keycode   0 press
keycode   1 release
keycode  55 release
keycode   0 release
keycode   1 release
keycode  55 release
which corresponds to keycode 183 (= 1*128 + 55).
The output of Linux 2.4.23 was
keycode 124 press
keycode 124 release
By the way, the bar key on JP 106 keyboard is actually the backslash
key and bar is equal to shift-backslash on JP 106. But there is
another backslash key (scancode 0x73) and input of backslash is not a
problem.
