Some. Try pretty much every platform except ix86. Plus now that M$ doesn't
support DOS you are starting to see graphics card manufactures dropping
VGA support. Even BIOS setup interfaces use the VESA graphics interface
these days. So VGA text days are numbered. I agree the framebuffer/console
layer really needs to reworked to do the right things. I plan to do that
for 2.5.X.
