while I appreciate your cleanups, I would like to ask you to be a bit
careful with the x86/ ones; some of these are for now deliberate to
make unification between the 32 and 64 ones possible.. eg we're working
on getting the more cosmetic (and in this context, removing a static is
more or less cosmetic) changes away so that "diff" shows us the *real*
differences between the 32 and 64 bit versions... adding back in the
static is the opposite direction ;)
So.. if you find ones that are real for both 32 and 64 bit, by all
means, but otherwise be a bit careful..
