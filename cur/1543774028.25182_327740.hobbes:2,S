Note that the numbers are not freak accidents, they are consistent
accross the various setups. So in total, that's 15 LMbench runs,
all showing consistent _severe_ cost for preempt_rt. And this despite
the fact that it comes down neck-to-neck with the ipipe on
interrupt response time in those same tests. I would highly suggest
setting up an automated benchmark for automatically running LMbench
on every preempt_rt release and compare that to the vanilla kernel.
