My best guess is that the orignally installed modules are stripped.
If you define INSTALL_MOD_STRIP then you would achieve the same.
From Documentation/kbuild/makefile.txt:
    INSTALL_MOD_STRIP
	If this variable is specified, will cause modules to be stripped
	after they are installed.  If INSTALL_MOD_STRIP is '1', then the
	default option --strip-debug will be used.  Otherwise,
	INSTALL_MOD_STRIP will used as the option(s) to the strip command.
So you could do something like this:
>$ INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 make modules_install
