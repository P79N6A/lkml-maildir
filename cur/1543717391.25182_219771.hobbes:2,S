Curious, why is it being implemented in this fashion instead of broadcasting
it over a netlink socket?
That way, the user-space listeners can determine whether they want to pay
attention to it or not, and figure out for themselves most of the "do I
care about this event" issue.
As for the directory heirarchy watching, does that mean the user can do:
<process 1>   <process 2>
              while : ; do mkdir a ; cd a ; done
    .... wait 10 seconds ....
listen to a/
What's the kernel going to do then?  Hopefully, you don't mean you'll
be crawling down the entire chain each and every time...
Just random thoughts.
