When I wrote it I was still misunderstanding GKHI's nature (I was assuming
that it worked on top of dprobes, not under it -- I should have read the 
source before commenting, my bad)
I think using dprobes for collecting information is ok, but when you want 
to do actual actions with it (not only using it as a debugger) IMHO it 
is better to patch and recompile the kernel.

As far as I can see GKHI is overkill for dprobes alone, the existing
notifier lists would be sufficient because dprobes does not hook into any 
performance critical paths.
