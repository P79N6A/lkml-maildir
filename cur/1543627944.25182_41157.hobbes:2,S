FYI, I have tried it as well (ide-2.4.19-p6.all.convert.3a.patch
on 2.4.19-p7 plus your recommended #if 0 change) and it has been
working nicely for me as well on a number of machines.  This
certainly seems to be a nice improvement.

Can you go into a little detail on your plans for error handling?
I think the currently error handling for the ide-subsystem,
especially in the presence of sequences of bad sectors, is not
especially robust (and is quite slow)...  In one case I tested
yesterday (with 2.4.19-p7 plus your patch) using a 340 MB
microdrive with a big chunk of bad sectors on it (the device
admittedly is in pretty sorry shape but makes an excellent
ide-subsystem tester ;-), the kernel wedged solid while trying to
read from it...
