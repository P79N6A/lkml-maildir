and your devfs stuff is a mess.  I already told one of the DVB folks
(it wasn't you IIRC) that I'll publish a 2.5 devfs API on 2.4 header.
But first I have to fix the devfs API on 2.5 and randomly bringing
back old crap and lots of ifdefs in those changing areas won't help.
What the problem with 2.5, dvb and devfs?
