Hi Dick,

Yes, I know insmod and herein the problem lies. I have a module where
I want to use functions provided by another module, _if_ it is present, 
otherwise use modules internal functions. 
So if I hardcode the function calls statically in my module, the insmod
goes trough of course, if the service module is present. But, it fails
if it's not. 
So, I want to load up, check if the service module is present, and use
it's servides.

I meant that in previous kernel version, some module symbol searching
functions were available.
