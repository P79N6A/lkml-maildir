Sure, adding a list of struct files to struct inode obviously works for 
me. But it does increase the size of struct inode which I thought you're 
not allowed to do ;-)
Anyway, there are still some other problems with this patch if we want to 
use it to implement forced unmount (my bad, we can't go changing struct 
inode because it's shared by different mount points).
