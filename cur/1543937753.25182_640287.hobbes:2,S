I'd say this implies the exact opposite.  It almost sounds like the 
compiler is free to change:
void foo(const int *x);
foo(x);
printf("%d", x);
to:
void foo(const int *x);
printf("%d", x);
foo(x);
especially if it can prove that the pointer to x doesn't otherwise 
escape or that foo doesn't call anything that could see the pointer (and 
given that gcc has special magical markings for malloc, one way this 
could be "proven" is to have x be some freshly malloced object.
If foo is kfree, then the above transformation is clearly invalid.
(Note that this isn't just a problem for optimizers -- a programmer 
might expect that passing a pointer to a function that takes a const 
pointer argument does not, in and of itself, change the pointed-to 
value.  Given that const certainly does not mean that no one else 
changes the object, I'm not sure what else it could mean.  kfree does 
not have either property, so I'm don't think it makes sense for it to 
take a const argument.)
