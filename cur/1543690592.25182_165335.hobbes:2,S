As we've experienced that it's possible to lose the one-and-only 
superblock, I would recommend that you build a backup superblock
in the future. Of course you're going to argue that some parameters
constantly change in the superblock so that it would mean a performance
penalty to have two of them. Well, the backup superblock should
be marked and used as such: It will allow a more "easy" recovery
of the filesystem parameters, should the primary be "gone", but 
it should not interfere with "normal operation". So, feel free to
only update it once every ten minutes or so. Or just initialize
it and only write it when the fs is unmouted. Or don't update it 
at all. But no backup superblock, is just plain wrong.
