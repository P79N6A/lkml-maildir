Is there problems? Zombie processes are basically dead, not

okay, so we have
	if (xxx->func)
		interrupt
			schedule()
but schedule at this point is certainly not going to enter signal
handling code, so refrigerator is deffered at run to userspace, so it
continues with
		interrupt return
		xxx->func()
	...
	attempt to return to userspace
		signal code
			refrigerator().
So I believe that is safe.
