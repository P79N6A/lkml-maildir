They did _NOT_ need links to directories. 'Cause they would not have them
on any relatively recent version of UNIX (say it, starting with '85-'86).
They certainly would not have them without suid-root.

Sigh... That's what you get for not using ISO9000 properly. Just have a
documented procedure for dealing with stupid buggers and when duh
management tries to press just say that we have to follow it to be
ISO9000-compliant. Works like a charm, _especially_ if the procedure
consists of telling said buggers to fsck off. BTDT.

Frankly, he could do much better, keeping almost the same structure.
Changes:
	* have a hidden directory in root (refered, but with impossible
name).
	* when you call link() do the following:
		if (target is a primary) {
			move target into the hidden directory
			create a link entry in the old directory
			point it to the moved target
		}
		create a link entry pointing to the target's primary
	* when you are unlinking the primary move it to hidden directory
	* when you are unlinking a link - remove it
	* when you are giving up the last reference to primary in the
hidden directory - remove it if all links are already gone.
Simple, effective and avoids all problems with links. Makes for very
simple locking rules. Keeps fs structure same as it is now.  I would also
change single-linked lists to double-linked ones (much faster and simpler
lists manipulations), but I can see the reasons to keep the layout.

Yes. And the whole thread was a fine example of people being unable to
understand that. Kernel is as threaded as it gets, there's nothing to
babysit it and BTW, kernel stack is 8K.

<shrug> Well, it's his code and all such... I wouldn't like to use a
filesystem I can't (in theory) repair by hands, but given a choice between
that and AFFS...

Nah... Try to get m68k folks - the last time I've dealt with _any_
m68k-based boxen was back in '92 (sun3). Sorry, full-time kernel janitor
work takes more than enough time ;-/

Once upon a time student came to master and said: "Master, you have taught
us for years and it was good. People of Tao are teaching differently and
those who listen to them are saying that it is also good. And people of
Kung-Tzu are also teaching differently and those who come to listen them
are also saying that it is good. What would happen if you would teach
together?" Master smiled and started to beat the student mercilessly.
Student got Enlightened.

<nods> That's the way it should work - there is a reason why manpages have
BUGS section... Basically, it should be easier to fix the crap than to
document the warts. 
Al, currently reading Plan 9 source for recovery - it's nice to read decent
C after wading through crazy perversions a-la drivers/block/DAC960.* ...
Said that, core kernel is more or less decent - definitely kinder on
reader than 4BSD... Fsck, why nobody teaches people to read other's code?
Lions' experiment is the only example I'm aware of. I just love this "I'm
not interested in the things that are there, I have brand-new save-the-world
ideas, whaddya mean 'they had been tried and failed miserably'?" attitude.
Sigh...
