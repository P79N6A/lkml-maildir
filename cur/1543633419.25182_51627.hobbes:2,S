Why? You can get rid of all uses of NR_CPUS (except for using it as a max 
capping value so none goes above it) and always use smp_num_cpus instead. 
And make the cpu hotplug code update smp_num_cpus as appropriate.
All code relying on smp_num_cpus for per-cpu buffers can do a check whether 
the current cpu is greater than the value of smp_num_cpus at per-cpu buffer 
allocation time and if so lock the kernel (or only the buffers if possible) 
and grow the buffer allocation up to the new smp_num_cpus value. And all 
that can be done nicely out of line in a really, really, snail speed slow 
path... The fastpath only needs to contain:
         cpu = smp_processor_id();
#ifdef CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU
         if (unlikely(cpu >= old_smp_num_cpus))
                 goto snail_path;
         snail_path_done:
#endif
So zero penalty for non-hotplug users and loads of penalty for hotplug 
users but frankly I couldn't care less for those. The slow path will 
trigger so seldom it is not worth thinking about the performance hit there.
You could even make the above look nicer by making it a function like:
cpu = smp_processor_id();
check_for_cpu_hotplug_event(cpu, old_smp_num_cpus, our_hotplug_callback);
And let our_hotplug_callback() deal with the case where cpu is >= 
old_smp_num_cpus, for example for ntfs that would involve extending the 
number of per-cpu buffers. And in the !CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU case the whole 
check_for_cpu_hotplug_event function becomes a NOP. All in the spirit of 
not having #ifdefs sprinkled around the code.
There are a lot of ways to deal with this corner case dynamically, so 
please use one of them. I don't buy the "lets penalise 99% of users for the 
sake of a feature that almost noone will ever use" argument.
Best regards,
         Anton
