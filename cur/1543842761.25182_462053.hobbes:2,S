Right.  I looked to see how hard it was in the usb case, but since
you are in the open and release case I can see it being hard.  I think
this case can also be triggered by file descriptor passing, as that
is another subtle way to dup a file descriptor.
The uid checks keep the current situation from being a security
hole but it is still possible to confuse user space, although you
should be able to do that much more simply by just sending the signal
yourself :)

So far I haven't seen any complaints on that score.  None from
the mainstream kernel folks the vserver guys or the OpenVz guys.
struct pid itself is in 2.6.18, performing this same function for
proc, but not all of the helper functions have made it beyond -mm
yet.  Most of the rest should make it into 2.6.19.
