Okay, it just happened again, after about half an hour of repeatedly
copying files from the Zip drive (vfat) to an ext2 partition.
I got pages and pages of oops logs, and "Aiee, killing interrupt handler"
at the end.  Magic SysRq still worked, and trying to sync made it say it
was trying to sync device 03:03.
I'm just recompiling so that there is a big pause after each oops, so that
I can catch what the first one is.
Tim.
