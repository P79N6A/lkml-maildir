Yes, that's the same algorithm all right, and 'synthetic division'
is a much better name for it than the one I used.  IMHO, we should be
doing this even when there happens to be an integral relationship 
between timer interrupt rate and HZ.  It eliminates a bunch of
posturing we'd otherwise be stuck with to explain/work around
restrictions in the choice of intervals.  With a little bit of head
scratching it's also possible to add the bookkeeping necessary to
handle varying physical interrupt rates, while still maintaining
the *exact* correct HZ tick count.
Stripping some cruft from your historical example:
 	SUB	WORD PTR [ACCUMULATOR],NUMERATOR
 	JNC	NO_TICK
 	MOV	AX,DIVISOR
 	ADD	WORD PTR [ACCUMULATOR],AX	; Synth div
 	CALL	TICK
NO_TICK:
Pretty hard to beat that for efficiency.
