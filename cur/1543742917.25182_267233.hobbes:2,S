i wrote a cli/sti latency tracer a couple of years ago so it's possible.
Note that an irqs-off condition is near impossible to 'leak' into
userspace code though, since the x86 iret path restores flags to the
previous value. Worst-case the irqs-off condition may leak into
kernelspace, and that can still cause bad effects. X startup/shutdown
can disable interrupts for a long time, was that excluded from your
testing?
