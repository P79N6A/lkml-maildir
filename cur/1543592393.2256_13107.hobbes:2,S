Let me suggest a different approach

Split the various locked versions stuff stuff like set_adc_rate out as
__set_adc_rate which doesnt take the lock, and set_adc_rate which takes the
lock and calls the other one.
That is how several other drivers were done and avoids messy lock/unlocks
some of which in your changes I think introduce races
Ditto for enable_dac as the old code and a newer __enable_dac, as well
I suspect as __set_spdifout (although is that ever called by anyone not
holding the lock ???)

That one doesnt seem to be needed
