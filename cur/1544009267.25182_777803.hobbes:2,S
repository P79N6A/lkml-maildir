argh.  I count at least thirteen separate developers who need to review
this patch.  Many of them would ideally be the ones who merge their
piece of it.  If they have issues or request updates, that churns the
whole patch.
I think I'll skip this one.
Overall it looks sensible (better than what we have now).  But
maintainers are funny things.  Parts of it will survive, others won't.
