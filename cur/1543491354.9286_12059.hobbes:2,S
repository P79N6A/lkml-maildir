Just to help your sanity, I hear you Larry, and agree with what you are
saying.
Of course, I'm thinking a userfs solution would work here.
sidenote: Does anyone know if there is a workable user fs patch set
anywheres for 2.2.x?
I had something like this going under a pseudo win95 userfs a while
back, and am working on a reimplementaion that will work both on win95
and on linux.  For the stuff I'm doing at least userfs would be
cleanest.  I'm thinking keeping the code for tar/gzip/bzip2/zip/... out
of the kernel would be a good thing.
Of course you get the cool side benefit of doing: cd foo.tar
