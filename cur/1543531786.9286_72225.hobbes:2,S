Yes.  However, I have more information now - bad checksums were being
generated due to a single dropped carry ;(
However, I've been investigating my longer term problem (the glitches in
playback of mp3s which seem to be co-incident with NFS stopping), and
have come up with the following:
0000aa60: RPC:      __rpc_wake_up done
0000aa60: RPC: 2070 __rpc_wake_up (now 43616 inh 0)
0000aa60: RPC: 2070 __rpc_wake_up (now 43616 inh 0)
0000aa60: RPC: 2070 removed from queue c0f3e048 "xprt_pending"
0000aa60: RPC: 2070 added to queue c01ad5d4 "schedq"
0000aa60: need_resched = 1, comm = mxaudio
0000aa60: RPC:      __rpc_wake_up done
0000aa60: RPC: 2071 __rpc_wake_up (now 43616 inh 0)
0000aa60: RPC: 2071 __rpc_wake_up (now 43616 inh 0)
0000aa60: RPC: 2071 removed from queue c0f3e048 "xprt_pending"
0000aa60: RPC: 2071 added to queue c01ad5d4 "schedq"
0000aa60: need_resched = 0, comm = kswapd
0000aa60: RPC:      __rpc_wake_up done
0000aa84: RPC: switch to rpciod
0000aa84: RPC:      rpc_schedule enter
0000aa84: RPC: 2065 removed from queue c01ad5d4 "schedq"
The number on the LHS is the "hex" value of jiffies.  You should notice
that activity seems to pause for 360ms.  Surprisingly, "need_resched" on
the current task is not set, so rpciod does not get scheduled, and relies
on the scheduler eventually getting around to the task (by which time, the
sound DMA buffers have emptied).
Before anyone asks, no I'm not running swap over NFS. ;)
