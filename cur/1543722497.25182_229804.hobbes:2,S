lib is for 32-bit and lib64 is for 64-bit obviously. Build success here 
is about 50%, a few build but won't run, segfaults etc.
The configure script in some apps needs the option --libdir=/usr/lib64 
e.g. there is also a /lib64 and /usr/X11R6/lib64. Some apps will 
configure and build without the need to adjust options. Some others will 
not build as distributed, e.g kmymoney which keeps looking in /usr/lib 
instead of /usr/lib64. There are yet others like slmodem that contain a 
32-bit proprietary module for 2.4.x that will not be compatible with  
2.6.x kernel sources.
Regards
Sid.
