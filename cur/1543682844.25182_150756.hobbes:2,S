I can't seem to find where the error messages are defined.
I have a creative webcam (ov511) that will sometimes not be recognised
on boot (unplugging and replugging usually works).
/proc/bus/usb/devices does not show it if it is not recognised.
There are several other USB devices attatched that work, though they
are connected to a different port on the motherboard. (swapping
does not help)
Any ideas?
