I've tried this on my PowerBook and it doesn't work. The keymap is broken and
pressing anything on the keyboard will output something completely different.
This is fixed if the "defined(CONFIG_MAC_HID)" gets move the "#elif" part of
the "#if" mentionned above.
That said, 2 and 3 button emulation is broken for (at least) the PowerBook on test-10.
I've tried the 
echo "1" > /proc/sys/dev/mac_hid/mouse_button_emulation
and there's no effect. Anyone know what this is about?
Thanks.
