    This doesn't address the problem. First, the threads need to refer
to *different* graphics contexts. Second, the API requires that these
contexts be identified by some thread-specific mechanism available to
the graphics library, not by explicit stack pointers in the application
- whether that mechanism is private mappings or tarot cards matters not,
so long as it's extremely fast.
    I assumed these points were both clear from my initial post, and not
really occasion for a rant about how "unstable and unmaintainable" IRIX
is, but whatever - so long as in the end Linux allows apps to issue
vertices at least as fast as other OSes on the same hardware.
