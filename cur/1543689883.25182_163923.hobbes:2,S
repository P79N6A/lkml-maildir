That's not "a machine" that's ~1150 machines on a network.  This business
of describing a bunch of boxes on a network as "a machine" is nonsense.
Don't get me wrong, I love clusters, in fact, I think what you are doing
is great.  It doesn't screw up the OS, it forces the OS to stay lean and
mean.  Goodness.
All the CC cluster stuff is about making sure that the SMP fanatics don't
screw up the OS for you.  We're on the same side.  Try not to be so rude
and have a bit more vision.
