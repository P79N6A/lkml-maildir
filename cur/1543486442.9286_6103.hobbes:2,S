Note: this _has_ been reported before, by David Howells and Molnar Ingo,
but no fixes have made it into the kernel, and all of the patches I've
seen
miss one or two of the problems I describe below.
I was writing a driver here the other day and discovered a bug which
prevents attempts to ioremap() the top of physical space on i386.  I was
able to fix it and I am now able to do things like
ioremap(0xFFF00000,0x100000);
which grabs the top 1MB of physical space. (hint: this is where the bios
flash chip might live on a system with an Intel chipset).  These accesses
fail on both 2.2.1 and 2.0.36 currently due to little bugs in __ioremap().
The problem is that __ioremap() does this:
101	if (phys_addr >= 0xA0000 && (phys_addr+size) <= 0x100000)
102		return phys_to_virt(phys_addr);
and this:
120	if (!size || size > phys_addr + size)
121		return NULL;
Problem #1:
You can see that first of all, the first test will (incorrectly) think
I'm within the range 0xA0000 - 0x100000 because phys_addr+size will
wrap to 0.  This should be phys_addr - 1 + size.
Problem #2:
The second test will fail because phys_addr+size, again, is 0.  This
should also be phys_addr - 1 + size to work properly.
Problem #3: (need help here)
The test on line 120 (checking for a range that will go past the end
of memory) should really be first, as the call
ioremap(0xFFF00000, 0x1B0000)
will be seen not as an illegal request, but as a request for the area
between 0xA0000 and 0x100000.  I'm thinking that this test should move
to the beginning of the function.  Are there any reasons why this would
be a bad idea?  (note I've done it in my patch below)
Thanks...

PS I'd appreciate a CC if anyone replies.
PPS this patch fixes it and I've been running with it for a few days
now, no problems.
