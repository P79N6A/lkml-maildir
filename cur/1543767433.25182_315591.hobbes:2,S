Hi,
the semantics of fnctl used together with F_SETLEASE and
argument F_RDLCK have been changed with bk changeset
1.1938.185.141 (sometime between 2.6.9 and 2.6.10).
Since then it's only possible to get a read lease when the
file in question does not have _any_ writers.
This is at least inconsistent with the man page of fcntl
and looks pretty much like this is a bug in the kernel.
Any comments?
Thanks,
Heiko
