This looks pretty nice now. One big glitch though. The syscall patch renames the existing
syscall entry points. Don't do this as it breaks stuff and makes it hard to be sure that
old code calls the right one (eg rebuilding libc5). Name the new ones things like
sys_chown32(). It isnt like the glibc names and kernel names must match
