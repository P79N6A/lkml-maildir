I know all this. Yes, iostream is has some benefits over stdio. I know. But
iostream is not point of this sample. Function test() is.

Gosh. TAKE A LOOK IN SAMPLE. PLEASE. BEFORE writing answer. In C++ sample
function ALSO has reference on object. Still:
-- C++ test() --
        movl 4(%esp),%eax
        movl 4(%eax),%edx
        pushl %eax
        movl 8(%edx),%eax   <-- this is additional instruction
        call *%eax
        addl $4,%esp
        ret
-- C test() --
        movl 4(%esp),%eax
        pushl %eax
        movl 4(%eax),%edx
        call *%edx
        addl $4,%esp
        ret
-- cut --
I KNOW WHY C++ is designed this way: " if you'll have a lot of virtual
functions and ...". Ok. But what if I'm not have a lot of virtual functions
and want speed instead ? I'm stuck -- there are only one object model and
it could not be changed ... And you could change class in runtime (commented
out code in C sample)... That was the point of my first letter :-)) Looks
like it was not understood by many readers :-((

Not at all. Take some C++ class. Make .o file. Take drived class. Make .o file.
Add in first class few fields and recompile ONLY first class. Link program
and try to start it. Good luck. With Java this all will work just fine :-)
BTW if you have .class file you could SCAN AND FIND all functions -- not so
with .o file. BTW this does not mean that we need real classes in kernel :-))
But nature of C++ when even slighest change in some basic class lead to full
recompilation is REALLY annoying for big projects :-(( So my basic point
reamains the same: C++ is total crap NOT USEFULL FOR ANYTHING. It's like
cake with salt fish -- both cake and salt fish and good things but when combined
together it's something horrible :-(( There are a lot of good concepts but the
end result is useless language. When you need speed you could not get it (see
sample C++ vs C above) and when you need something for big projects you could
not use it either due lack of modularity (include files is just plain shame
for modern language). And when there are exceptions in language but they are
not used in standard library (STL, iostream) it's also not good for that
language... It's really bad for perl if it's really being rewritten on this
monster :-(((

Oberon use two-stage compilation. Last stage is performed by loader. But in the
end it's true compiled code (not pseudo-code!) loaded in memory.
