You need visibility into the actual place where the issue is
happening, and by your description it's the two cards fighting each
other on the PCI bus. (I'm assuming that the problem doesn't occur
when there's only one card.)
I've worked on a platform where only a few things went through the PCI
bus, and via the firmware's debugger (completely outside the kernel),
I was able to do the setup of the PCI chip and mappings, and then
pound on the hardware directly to exhibit a lockup of the bus. That
provided pretty strong proof that it wasn't some other unrelated issue
in the kernel causing us grief.
At that point, it was pretty clear that was it, as there was no kernel
running, and the CPU was still responsive. Renting a logic analyzer
was the next step.

Lots of sleeps in between each and every write to the hardware, with
regular output. Of course, if it's a timing issue (which is what it
sounds like), you're screwed.
Other than that, I look at the hardware guys and say "Your turn," and
walk out of the room to get a cup of coffee.
