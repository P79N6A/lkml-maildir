To what extent?  Integration testing with as much hardware as possible?
The community as a whole does that.  Automated integration testing?
Please step forward for recognition if you are.  
Automated functional testing of the kernel?  Yes, SGI is working on
that.  We still have a lot of work to do to get reasonable coverage, but
we do have employees testing Linux.  We have released some tests and a
simple test driver under the Linux Test Project.  
If anyone has tests they would like to contribute to LTP, please send
them to me.  I will try to get the tests integrated into an automated
system.  The way I see it, if we can pull all of the home grown tests
out of the wood work, we will have a better testing system than the
defacto "build the kernel" system.
