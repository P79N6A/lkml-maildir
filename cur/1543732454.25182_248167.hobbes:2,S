That implies that samba can do the same transform set without kernel
help and you'd even get the advantages of being able to transfer the
stuff around sanely afterwards.
What I don't understand is the tie between Linux having such streams and
Windows doing it for Samba to work. Netatalk has always handle this for
Macintosh and portably. Presumably any Samba support would need to
handle OS's without wacky files for portability too ?
