I have an ASUS A7V266-E motherboard, AMD AthlonXP 1800+ CPU.
several hard drives of various makes.
I've tested a couple different kernels... all (afaik) with preempt.
I've tried 2.4.22-10mdk, plus 2.4.23-pac1+preempt+lowlatency, and also a 
2.4.22-ac4+preempt
What I'm getting are deadlocks on what I think are dma issues when copying 
btwn hdf and hdg.
according to /proc/ide/*/model
hda is a WDC AC28400R
hdb is a Maxtor 93652U8
hde is a WDC WD200BB-32BSA0
hdf is a Maxtor 4D060H3
hdg is a Maxtor 4D060H3 (just installed today, likely used)
i've only gotten ONE error message 
Dec  3 12:51:12 tabriel kernel: hdf: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x61
and that was with 2.4.22-10mdk
the rest all deadlock without ANY error messages.
Help?

currently copying from hdf -> hdg with DMA turned off on hdf. going at 
about 1MB/minute, with some spikes.
