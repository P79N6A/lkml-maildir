hi all,
	'diff -r' between 2.4.19-pre8 downloaded from ftp.kernel.org and
	the same version extracted from bitkeeper (parent is
	bk://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.4), produce the follow diff. it's
	not a big issue, but it's a little annoying to apply -ac
	patches.
thanks for your work,
andrea gelmini

< Once the mmap has been made the VIDIOCMCAPTURE ioctl sets the image size
< you wish to use (which should match or be below the initial query size).
< Having done so it will begin capturing to the memory mapped buffer. Whenever
< a buffer is "used" by the program it should called VIDIOCSYNC to free this
< frame up and continue. <em>to add:</em>VIDIOCSYNC takes the frame number
< you are freeing as its argument. When the buffer is unmapped or all the
< buffers are full capture ceases. While capturing to memory the driver will
< make a "best effort" attempt to capture to screen as well if requested. This
< normally means all frames that "miss" memory mapped capture will go to the
< display.
