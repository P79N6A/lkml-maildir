Hi all,
I tried using my Xilinx JTAG adapter to program an AVR ATmega8 microcontroller 
using avrdude-5.1. As soon as avrdude tries to access the parallel port, the 
machine locks up solid: no kernel messages at all, no IP traffic, console is 
locked solid and cursor doesn't flash.
This is on a Sun Ultra 5.
Any ideas?
Chris
