Subject: [PATCH] _raw_read_trylock for alpha
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/3/19/107

alpha SMP doesn't build, due to lack of _raw_read_trylock().
Patch below completely untested...  needs review and testing.
One could also use the arch-neutral generic_raw_read_trylock(),
but that implementation is rather lame (it spins).  I'm amazed at the
number of arches that use the generic implementation, since the generic
version isn't really a "trylock".
Don't send this patch upstream until its been verified to actually work.
