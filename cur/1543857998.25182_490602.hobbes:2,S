rdtscp gets you 2 of the 5 values you need to compute the time.  anything 
can happen between when you do the rdtscp and do the other 3 reads:  the 
computation is (((tsc-A)*B)>>N)+C where N is a constant, and A, B, C are 
per-cpu data.
A/B/C change a few times a second (to avoid 32-bit rollover in (tsc-A)), 
every time there's a halt, and every P-state transition.
if you lose your tick in the middle of those reads any number of things 
can happen to screw the computation... including being scheduled on 
another core and mixing values from two cores.

oh i think there are several solutions which will work... and i also think 
rdtscp wasn't a necessary addition to the ISA :)
