Hi !
I'm working on fixing a couple of drivers for a PCI DMA non-cache
coherent architecture (StrongARM/21285 based board), and in order to be
completely safe, I need the ring descriptors to be in non-cachable space
(since a cache line beeing larger that a single descriptor entry, writing
to one may override datas written to another by the chip).
What is the "preferred" way of allocating a piece of RAM and making in
non-cachable from within a driver ?
I'm not very familiar with Linux memory allocation (yet), I can imagine a
"brutal" way of doing a ioremap(virt_to_phys(my_kmalloced_memory)) with
the appropriate flags in ioremap but I'm not 100% sure this is safe. Any
advice ?
Also, in io.h, there are some macros defining (or not defining depending
on the architecture) the flush and invalidate routines for DMA. That's
great, but there are at least 2 important informations missing from this
header file in order to write safe drivers:
 - The cache line size (I beleive it may be defined elsewhere, is there a
standard #define for it ?)
 - and wether we are coherent or not. For the coherency, this is more
complicated since it depends on the bus we are on. I beleive we could at
least define a standard macro/function for PCI, taking a pcidev and
returning if the path from this device to system memory is coherent or
not, or if it requires GFP_DMA in kmalloc. Something like:
int pci_dma_is_cache_coherent(struct pcidev *device);
returning PCI_DEV_COHERENT, PCI_DEV_INCOHERENT, PCI_DEV_SPECIALALLOC
On most architecture, this function could be a simple macro or inline
returning  PCI_DEV_COHERENT. ARM would always return PCI_DEV_INCOHERENT,
and would I leave the last one for possibke remaining special cases.
Any comments ?
