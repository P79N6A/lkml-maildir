It did not seem that you can make a radio button / multi-select kernel 
config option unless the options are in the same Kconfig file.  Given 
that xmon and kgdb are mutually exclusive at the moment.
What Sergei mentioned is the fix that needs to be used for the time being. 
Attached is the patch I put in the for_mm branch in the linux-2.6-kgdb 
git tree.

xmon_or_kgdb.patch
From: Jason Wessel <jason.wessel@windriver.com>
Subject: [PATCH] Turn off xmon if kgdb is active on ppc and powerpc
Xmon and kgdb are mutuall exclusive at the moment so xmon should be
turned off in the kernel config options if kgdb selected.  The case with "make allmodconfig" was failing and this patch addresses the problem.
