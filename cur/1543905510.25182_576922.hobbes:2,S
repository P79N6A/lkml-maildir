people should not swap over DRBD,
because it would not be useful.
DRBD is to have applicaction data available for more than one node,
without a single point of failure; when the node the app currently runs
on crashes, the data is there so some other node can take over from there.
what would you do with the swap of a crashed node, apart from,
well, crash analysis?
you don't need it to be highly available for that.
besides, yes, when you have network io in the block io path,
with linux (and probably most other OSes),
there is the posibility of vm starvation or even deadlock.
situation is improving, though - iirc, there has been talk to
have a emergency memory pool very low level in the network stack,
and some special "I am doing block-io" socket flag;
what is the status of that, anyone?
I belive DRBD behaves very good even in oom situations.
we considered these things from the very beginning.
that said,
I did not see a DRBD cluster hanging hard in OOM, yet.
and we do operate quite a few busy
database/mail/web/file/application/iSCSI/whatever clusters.
