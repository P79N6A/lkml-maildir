Or why not to include an embedded version of gcc/binutils in the kernel
LKM interface. In this way all drivers can only be distributed in source 
code which effectively makes all forms of binary only drivers impossible. 
After that all the EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL nonsense can be removed and a proper 
DDI layer can be implemented for Linux. This makes it possible to ship 
"outside the kernel build" drivers without a risk of major 
incompatibility problems in the next kernel version. No, I'm not 100% 
serious but just 50%.
Best regards,
Hannu
