I grepped kernel *.c (not *.h!) files for extern variable definitions.
Much to my surprize, I found ~1500 such defs.
Isn't that bad C code style? What will happen if/when type of variable gets 
changed? (int->long).
I thought external definitions ought to be in *.h files.
Maybe I'm missing something here...
