I'm uneasy with your stat(2) modification.
I think when you change the meaning of field values, you should tell the C
library about it. glibc could do ugly tricks, like trying getuid32 syscall
first and if it returned error, it would know the kernel does not support
the new st_uid/st_gid fields, but that costs you a syscall for the common
case in the future where both glibc and kernel will have large uids/LFS and
stuff like that.
So I'd propose creating stat64, lstat64, fstat64 system calls for all the
platforms which need it and carefuly lay out the new structures, so that
they will hold LFS values, large device numbers, large uids etc.
I wonder whether we are going to use 32bit or 64bit dev_t, because right now
I can still change it for sparc64 in the stat structure (all fields are LFS
capable but dev_t is right now 32bit there), after one month or two I'd have
to add new syscall like it will be needed on all 32bit ports.

Your glibc patch should care about binary compatibility and let all possible
combinations to work (old vs. new kernel and old vs. new glibc). So, I'd
propose not to change names of the old syscalls, it will just create severe
confusion for glibc maintainers, rather name the new syscalls differently.

Historical reasons, it was first a copy of the SunOS syscall table I think
and then split from that, so the identical syscalls between SunOS and Linux
have usually the same syscall number.
