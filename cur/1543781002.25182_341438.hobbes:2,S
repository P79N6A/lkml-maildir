Looking closer at this, I'd say that files_lock should be replaced by 
locking of the respective lists (struct sb->s_files and struct 
tty_struct->tty_files, unless I'm mistaken),  and that this locking 
should be done with semaphores. Right?
Going through the list of all sb->s_files can be a costly operation; it 
may be worthwile to have a per-sb locking mechanism for that.
