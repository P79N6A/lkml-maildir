Subject: [PATCH 00/02] remove set_wmb
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

set_wmb(var, value) is not used anywhere in the kernel. And it doesn't
do anything special but shorten the typing of:
  var = value;
  wmb();
Which the above is much more readable, and thus set_wmb is just
something to confuse developers even more.
So this patch series removes set_wmb from the kernel.  It's not
currently used in the kernel, and any out-of-kernel branch can easily
replace it.  So there should be no harm in removing it.
The first patch removes it from Documentation/memory-barriers.txt and
the second patch does a sweep through all the architectures to get rid
of it.  All archs do the above code except ia64 and sparc which do a
mb() instead.  But regardless, it's still not used.
