Yeah, my driver is the same one John sent.  I ported my copy to 2.4 but other
than that a quick diff shows that they are pretty much the same.

I'm not sure what I can and can't disclose but we *have* experienced hardware
problem that is BIOS related.  Some guys at NSC fixed it by changing our BIOS and
supposedly it was simple but they didn't tell us what it was.   My rev of the
dp83815.c code definitely does not fix it.  I'll dig out my original dp83815.c
and my hacked up 2.4 dp83815.c and I can send it to somebody if they want to
decide which driver is better. I know next to nothing about writing ethernet
drivers so I can help but I'm not qualified to make decisions..  I want to help
in any way that I can though.

I don't know who exactly TeamF1 is but my NSC sales rep says that when they
produced the MacPhyter chipset (the 83815) they hired some guys out of Seattle to
cons up an ethernet driver because a number of people building web pads and other
embedded products with Linux wanted one.   As far as I can tell NSC isn't working
with TeamF1 anymore, it was a quick fix to make a sale or two and when I last
asked they were trying to put together a Linux support team so they could support
the driver in-house.  I don't think they are terribly motivated to act on it,
it's sales people who keep giving me that line.
