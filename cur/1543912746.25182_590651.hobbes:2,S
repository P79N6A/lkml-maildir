    IDE code attempts to autotune PIO mode and fails at that because your 
device is too old (or its manufacturer was too lazy) to support ATA-2 (or EIDE 
from marketing PoV) is its full glory.

    No, it just means that the IDE code is *too young* to support such 
pre-EIDE devices. :-D

   That means that you've managed to find pre-EIDE/ATA hardware which doesn't 
support setting arbitrary PIO modes. What's funny is that resently being 
discussed here, so expect a patch RSN. :-)

    Oh, interesting geometery, and the size too. :-)

    That explains it. :-)

    That's generally not the device task (although there probably were IDE 
devices with 32-bit data bus?.. :-O
