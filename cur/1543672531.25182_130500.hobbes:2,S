That's how it should be.  We had tons of problems due to mismatchig
headers (usually it was "just" compile breakage because older libc
headers / compilers couldn't cope with constructs used in new kernel
headers) in the past and the only way to fix this is really don't 
ever use mismatching headers.  This is not just related to kernels,
for example Oracle ()at least up to 8i) ships .o files for their product
that were compiled on some development box but then link them at
installation time to the user's system libc.  You can guess how this
breaks :)
