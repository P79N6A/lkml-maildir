How about starting the whole thing with these steps:
short term:
A central place where kernel hackers document the hardware support for a given
device would be a good starting point.
Also they can start to document how well a company provided information to
create a free driver.
This would be completely independend from financial aspects.
It should be with some structure, as opposed to a pure wiki approach, which was
suggested somewhere in the original thread.
Kernel folks are allowed to enter devices/change Status/log ongoing development
steps
All others are allowed to comment as testers/reviewers
see where it goes.
long term:
establish and define the conditions under which a free driver logo is used 
i.e. award companies/hardware for excellent linux support with 
"penguin driver logo"
or grant use of logo "linux ready" for use on boxed retail.
