Subject: [ANNOUNCE] PCI-SCI Drivers 1.2-2 reposted

I have reposted the PCI-SCI files since some folks have reported  
corruption in one of the files on our server.  These drivers
support PCI-SCI hardware versions up to the PSB66.  
These drivers can be downloaded for 2.2 and 2.4 Linux at 
vger.timpanogas.org:/sci/pci-sci-1.2-2 via ftp or 
from www.ute-linux.org
No new bugs have been reported for these drivers, this is a 
reposting.  If you ran into any problems with a previous 
version of these drivers, you may want to download them 
again.
