This is a nuisance on embedded systems which don't use modules, and 
which don't have tuners. I've ended up maintaining a local patch to 
force this on. It affects every user of i2c-algo-bit, but nothing else 
on this particular board suffers as a consequence.
What might be useful would be a config option to build bttv without 
tuners and i2c to reduce code size and sidestep this problem. Would you 
take a patch that did that?
