Seems that we are now getting strange errors mounting an ext2 root
filesystem under 2.6.23-git18:
  EXT2-fs error (device sda1): ext2_check_page: bad entry in directory #2:
  rec_len is smaller than minimal - offset=0, inode=0, rec_len=0,
  name_len=0
This seems to be occuring consistently since 2.6.23-git18.  I have been
back and rerun a -git17 job to confirm its not visible at that level.
This bug is expressing itself in 2.6.23-rc1 also.
I am suspicious of this commit in the -git17 -> -git18 block:
  commit 89910cccb8fec0c1140d33a743e72a712efd4f05

      ext2: avoid rec_len overflow with 64KB block size
/me goes debug this a bit more.
Jan?
