No, there is at least one other place which relies on this feature last
I searched.  They're all supposed to be stem matches, so __setup("foo")
matches "foobar=100" for example.

Good point, but I think this is clearer:
Name: Handle __early_param and __setup Collision
Status: Booted on 2.6.7-rc2-bk7
Depends: EarlyParam/early_param.patch.gz
Signed-off-by: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
Yi Zhu (yi.zhu@intel.com) points out the following problem:
In arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:
	__early_param("acpi", early_acpi);
In drivers/acpi/osl.c:
	__setup("acpi_os_name=", acpi_os_name_setup);
The problem command line looks like:
	"acpi=force acpi_os_name=my_override_name"
For simplicity, we overload the __setup section to contain both
__early_param and __setup, so we can check that all options on the
command line are taken by at least one of them.  However,
__early_param have different semantics the __setup: in particular,
__early_param("acpi"), must not match anything but "acpi" and "acpi=",
which mirrors module_param(), whereas __setup("acpi") would match
anything which starts with "acpi".
Fix the obsolete_checksetup code to take this difference into account
correctly.
