The Cyrix chips have an extremely low power mode: they stop the clock
on halt. They use microwatts in this mode (you need to frob a register
to enable this). On an idle machine, these chips don't need a heatsink
and still run cool.
If you enable APM on these machines, the CPU runs hot even though it's
idling. That's because the clock is still running. Slower, yes. But
there's a big difference between slowing down the clock a few times,
or stopping it entirely.
