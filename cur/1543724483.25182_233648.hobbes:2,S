2.6.7-bk20 minus the cset works.
Testing with 2.6.8-rc1 and backing out one or both of the changes in the
cset I get these results :
2.6.8-rc1       - vanilla                                       - breaks Java
2.6.8-rc1-jju1  - both changes backed out                       - works
2.6.8-rc1-jju2  - only first change (sys_rt_sigsuspend) applied - works
2.6.8-rc1-jju3  - only second change (sys_sigaltstack) applied  - breaks Java
