You do not understand the nature of what the test can generate.
We can decode the sweep pattern now.
Instead of 0->End of drive.
PlatterOD->PlatterID top
PlatterOD->PlatterID bottom.
This will get us zone-profiles an determine where the sweet spots are on
a given disk are and make a record.  We whould reload the profile of the
drive at INIT.
Will explain more later, I have my two-year old in my lap asleep.
