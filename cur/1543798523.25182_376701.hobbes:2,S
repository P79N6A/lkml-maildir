I have not tried this particular test program in a long time. I nfact, I would
like to remove it from the suite because it does not make any real sense.
In any case, it should not crash the kernel. I will investigate this.
I don't think it it related to you using a P6. This is more the case of
an error in the cleanup code in case the context cannot be created properly.
Does task_smpl work properly?
