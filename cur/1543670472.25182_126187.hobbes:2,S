Better in some environments, not all.  It's a tradeoff.
Me, I'd far rather allocate those hotplug resources on demand
than pre-allocate them into Yet Another Daemon.  For bounded
response-time systems, or for systems that are generating huge
event streams, I'd likely want more control though.

It could do that regardless of whether the event is eventually
delivered through some socket or by spawning a new process.
The way hotplug events are handled after some subsystem decides
to send them isn't written in stone.  They've been asynchronous
all through the 2.4 series, so queueing is semantically OK.
