I don't have any problems with the interface, and am ok with the driver 
core and sysfs changes. I have the sysfs binary file patch, but would you 
mind sending me the class device release() patch separately? 
Also, what about just creating a drivers/firmware/ directory (or 
drivers/base/firmware/) for the core code? 
Thanks,
