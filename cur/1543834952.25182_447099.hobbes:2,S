I beg to differ.  It is a bug.  You cannot reenter the file system when
the file system is trying to allocate memory.  Otherwise you can never
allocate memory with any locks held or you are bound to introduce an
A->B B->A deadlock somewhere.

b) is impossible for ntfs.  The only potential partial solution would be
to make ntfs use trylock everywhere and if that fails abort whatever the
VFS is trying to do with an EAGAIN and it is up to the VFS to deal with
it.  That would require quite a big rewrite of the VFS given a lot of FS
methods invoked by the VFS do not have a return value at the moment...
For example put_inode and clear_inode would need to accept EAGAIN and
would have to undo what was done before them so they could be retried
later.  To steal your own words, "we would have a better kernel" if the
VFS did error handling and recovery properly...  (-;
Several random examples:
- NTFS holds metadata in page cache pages so if you want to reclaim a
page ntfs has to flush the metadata to disk.  It cannot do that without
holding locks.
- When an inode has to be flushed out due to clear_inode ntfs has to
take i_mutex in order to write the inode to disk properly (which
involves locking all parent directories of the inode in turn and
updating the directory entry for that inode - this has to be done
because the directory entry in ntfs contains not only the filename but
also the stat information such as file size, allocation size on disk,
a/m/c/C time etc and chkdsk in Windows complains if those are not
uptodate.
Best regards,
