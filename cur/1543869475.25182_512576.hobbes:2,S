Subject: [patchset] Syslets/threadlets, generic AIO support, v4

this is the v4 release of the syslet/threadlet subsystem:
    
http://redhat.com/~mingo/syslet-patches/
v4 is a smaller update than v3 (so i wont send out the full queue to 
lkml - see the broken out queue in the patches-v4 directory at the URL 
above). Changes since v3:
- the threadlet API changed: the sys_async_threadlet() syscall now takes
  a 'completion event' pointer, and auto-completes it into the
  completion ring. I've updated the test-threadlet.c code to make use of
  it. So completion of threadlets and syslets is quite similar now -
  sharing even more infrastructure. (To get true pthread compatibility a
  sys_exit() driven CLEARTID completion method will be added too in the
  future).
- a small performance fix for syslet rescheduling. The syslet ABI has
  not changed.
- test-threadlet.c fixes a thread stack leak, and the other tests too
  have a number of small fixes and cleanups.
