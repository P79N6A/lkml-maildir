Hello!
I've have enabled debugging and was expecting to see this as well but I don't.
I'll assume this disapears if you change GFP_KERNEL to GFP_ATOMIC for tnode
and leaf allocations well replace throughout fib_trie.c
Cheers.

grep GFP  /usr/src/git/new/net/ipv4/fib_trie.c
                return kcalloc(size, 1, GFP_KERNEL);
        pages = alloc_pages(GFP_KERNEL|__GFP_ZERO, get_order(size));
        struct leaf *l = kmalloc(sizeof(struct leaf),  GFP_KERNEL);
        struct leaf_info *li = kmalloc(sizeof(struct leaf_info),  GFP_KERNEL);
                     GFP_KERNEL);
        stat = kmalloc(sizeof(*stat), GFP_KERNEL);
        struct fib_trie_iter *s = kmalloc(sizeof(*s), GFP_KERNEL);
        struct fib_trie_iter *s = kmalloc(sizeof(*s), GFP_KERNEL);
