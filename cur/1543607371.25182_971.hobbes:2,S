We could have bought a much cheaper controller and slower disks ;-)

That seems to have no effect on performance. Btw., the 64GB support in
2.4.10 seemed to be buggy ("0-order allocation failed", then the DB
crashed), so we were using the 4GB setting.

This helped - now performance is up to par with 2.2.19 (~ 85MB/s) - thanks!

I tried this, but with
  dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/null bs=1024k count=3000
(the fs is too slow - so "cp" peaks out at 17MB/s!)
The result (last 4 lines):
c01388fc try_to_free_buffers                          55   0.1511
c0128b10 file_read_actor                            1179  14.0357
c01053b0 default_idle                               6784 130.4615
00000000 total                                      8695   0.0065
Does this suggest that the kernel isn't the bottleneck?
