Hans,
You know, I keep hearing all this egotistical hype about originality and
open source, but sorry, the open source community has no corner on it.  I
developed the first S/370 BUS and TAG attached PC Server that ran Netware, I
developed the worlds first SMP Network Operating System (Netware SMP).  I've
got originality gushing out of every orifice of my body and always have, but
this doesn't mean that I don't see things clearly.  No offense, but you
missed the point.
Also, people who truly innovate are routinely HATED and have NO FRIENDS
because they are different and they go against the status quo (something I
experience every day I get up and go to work).  Look at Tesla, Edison,
Pastuer, DaVinci.  All of these people were hated in their lives and few
understood their profound vision or the long term impact they would have on
the world.
You should stop hogging the "Open Source Dope Pipe", since it clearly has
you seeing "visions" of how open source is going to solve world hunger and
global warming.  I agree that there are guys with good ideas and an open
source effort is one of the many ways to give people a viable outlet for
their creativity -- but the models that have evovled for computing are based
on more subtle "programs" inside of us, i.e. our DNA.
So where's the neural interface engine for Linux so we don't need keyboards
or terminals?  How about the telepathic mouse sensor?  Perhaps one day, whe
these devices show up (due to someone's originality) I could invent a new
computer language that uses them.  It will only have two commands, "set bugs
off" and "do what I'm thinking".
Regards,
Jeff
