Are you judging based on the error message?  The 'netdev watchdog ...'
message is a generic error message that could have any number of
causes.  It's just saying, well, what it says :)  The kernel was unable
to transmit a packet in a certain amount of time.  You might get these
messages if you unplug a cable suddenly, or if your hardware isn't
delivering interrupts, or many other things...
