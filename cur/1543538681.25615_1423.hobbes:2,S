Agreed. That is exactly what I'm trying say by telling that lru_cache and
lru_mapped_cache have different implicit priorities and we can't threat
them in the same way.

In 2.[234].x we basically first try to shrink the cache for disk and when
we run low in cache for disk (so when we start to fail in shrinking it) we
fallback shrinking the cache for program. That's sane algorithm even if
currently it's not very smart in understanding when it's time to shrink
the cache for programs and it's also not able to shrink it properly in
some case.
