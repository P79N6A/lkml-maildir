The former is best treated by using the hardware in question as a pissuary,
to make sure that its contents matches the quality of design.  The latter
might be more interesting - RBC devices are only required to implement
MODE SENSE/SELECT page 6; they shouldn't get messed by the rest, but at
least some of them blindly respond with page 6 to _every_ MODE SENSE.
So that might be a good reason to blacklist.
