Actually all of the clients are 2.4 (RH 7.0).  I could change them out to
2.5, but it may take me a little while.
Let me do a little digging around.  I seem to recall an issue I had earlier
this year when waking up the nfsd threads and having most of them just go
back to sleep.  I need to go back to that code and understand it a little
better.   Thanks for all of your help.
