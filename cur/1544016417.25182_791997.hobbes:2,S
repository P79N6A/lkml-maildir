Right, found all that...
Can't spot anything obviously wrong though.. hrtimer_start*() does
remove_hrtimer() which checks STATE_ENQUEUED, STATE_PENDING and pulls it
off the relevant list before it continues the enqueue.
However a loop in enqueue_hrtimer() would suggest a corrupted RB-tree,
but I cannot find an RB-op that doesn't hold base-lock.
Hohumm..
