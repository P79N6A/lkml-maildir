A very trivial change, I have just merged this one by hand :
***************
*** 318,323 ****
  	unsigned long policy;
  	unsigned long cpus_allowed;
  	unsigned int time_slice;
  
  	task_t *next_task, *prev_task;
  
--- 322,328 ----
  	unsigned long policy;
  	unsigned long cpus_allowed;
  	unsigned int time_slice;
+ 	unsigned long flags;
  
  	task_t *next_task, *prev_task;
  
Otherwise, the patch apply cleanly.
I attach you the corrected patch (I don't knwo why, it is
significiantly larger than the original patch, I have used diff -Naur,
I hope I don't get lost when I did it, it is surely better to use the
original patch and to do the little merge by hand)
