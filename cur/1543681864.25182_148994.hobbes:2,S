coming in late on this thread, hope I'm not showing my better half.
You may want to look at the work NASA has done on their enhanced
loopback driver;
ftp://ftp.hq.nasa.gov/pub/ig/ccd/enhanced_loopback/
Allows you to take a physical image of a device (such as one created by
'dd') and mount the logical volumes contained within, even if starting
FS code is beyond the 2GB puke limit.   It will mount the volumes 'ro'
for you.
However, be careful if you need true 'ro' on the reiserfs and ext3
filesystems.  So far in our testing mounting these 'ro' via loop device
files (/dev/loop0, etc.) *fails*.  The journal count *is* incremented on
the 'ro' filesystem and writes *can* still occur.
cheers!
