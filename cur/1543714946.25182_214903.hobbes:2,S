well, it's the kernels job to abstract hardware. You don't also expose
raw scsi and ide devices to userspace, you abstract them away and
provide a uniform "block device" interface to userspace.
The input layer tries to do the same wrt HID devices and imo it makes
sense. Why should userspace care if a mouse is attached to the USB port
or via the USB->PS/2 connector thingy to the PS/2 port. Requiring
different configuration for both cases, and potentially even requiring
different userspace applications for each type make it sound like
abstracting this away from userspace does have merit.
