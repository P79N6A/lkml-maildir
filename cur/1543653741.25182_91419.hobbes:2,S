Hello,
I've been getting some oopses regarding fs corruption, and getting
these in the logs:
Sep 26 10:38:13 flop kernel: EXT2-fs error (device ide2(33,1)):
ext2_free_branches: Read failure, inode=8732674, block=-1
Nov  3 04:47:52 flop kernel: EXT2-fs error (device ide0(3,3)):
ext2_free_blocks: Freeing blocks not in datazone - block = 757096807,
count = 1
Logs show errors on all ide devices, indicating sw rather than hw?
Though my disks are running rather hot, could this be a reason
perhaps.
All disks are Fujitsus, /proc shows the models as
FUJITSU MPG3409AT E
FUJITSU MPE3273AH
The motherboard is an ABIT kt7.
uname -a shows
Linux flop 2.4.18 #1 Sun Sep 29 20:23:13 BST 2002 i686 unknown
Could any replies be cc'd to m@ttvenn.net.
Thanks,
Matt
