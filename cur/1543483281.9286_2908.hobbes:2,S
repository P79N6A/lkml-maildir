NO, this is CERTANTLY WRONG. 
I dont know the exact numbers (it was posted a bit back, do a search)
But it depends on the Block size chosen (default is 1k but upto 4k is easy
on x86 on 8k on alpha I recall) and the arch (32 vs 64 bit).
1TiB might be the lowest limlt (1k,32bit) but there is no reason not to
format such a FS with 4k blocks.
