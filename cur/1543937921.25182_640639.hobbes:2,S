Yeap, there is no problem if you don't allow them to be linked into the
kernel.  If that's how you want it, please go ahead.
I personally think it's a bit odd to disallow building into kernel
because of the peculiarity of the implementation (including c files and
compiling them slightly differently) and also no one reporting doesn't
necessarily mean no one has attempted it and failed.
Thanks.
