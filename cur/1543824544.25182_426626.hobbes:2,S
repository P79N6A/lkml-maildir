I am working on patchset dealing with this problem. It still needs clean
up. The basic idea is to add a SA_MUSTTHREAD along with SA_NODELAY. Under
PREEMPT_RT all interrupthandlers, which doesn't have SA_NODELAY, will get
SA_MUSTTHREAD unless the driver is changed. In irq_request() it is checked
if the handler has SA_NODELAY and an old has SA_MUSTTHREAD and visa
versa.
I have also made a lock type which can be changed from rt_mutex to
raw_spin_lock runtime. And I have made a system with a call-back from the
irq-layer to the driver so they can change their spinlocks on the fly when
needed.
