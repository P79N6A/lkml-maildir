Ok, is there any better way to achieve the same this? As far as I
can tell, mmc_remove_host() uses mmc_flush_scheduled_work() for the
same purpose -- it ensures that scans that have already been started
will have completed before the function continues.

Thanks.

I wouldn't call it luck. The way mmc_rescan() is implemented, any scans
that are started before late_initcall time are completed before
mmc_finish_detect() returns. The steps are all done synchronously in
the workqueue function.
And I never realized that using a block device as a parameter to the
root= parameter could possibly be "unofficial" functionality...?
