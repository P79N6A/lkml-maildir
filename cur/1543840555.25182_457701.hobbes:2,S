I am not denying any of the above :)
I think my original point is getting lost in the discussion, which is,
there should be way (for the sysadmin) to get a list of tasks belonging
to a resource group (in a non-container environment).

I meant _only_ w.r.t resource management. My earlier replies were
pointing quite a few of those. here are a few:
- ability for the sysadmin to move a task to a resource group.
- assignment of task to a resource group should be transparent to the 
  app.
- a resource group could exist with no tasks associated.
Containers can work without these features (and as OpenVZ proves it does
work). But, for a QoS type of resource management framework these are
mandatory.

Support for different resources is a different topic. Users (of the two
models) can decide to control as many (or as few) resources as they
want. What I am talking here is about the ability of the framework.
