Rik,
I don't know about vmware (probably applies too) but more than one person
at Veritas can be justly offended by your implication that Veritas
employees have not contributed anything useful to the Linux kernel.
I hope I understood you incorrectly and you weren't implying anything of
the kind.
In fact, the very existence of any "issue" here is due to the fundamental
impossibility to "measure" such contributions by inventing some
constraints on exporting symbols to modules.
Regards,
Tigran
