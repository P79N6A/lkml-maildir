The G4 has 4 performance monitor counters that you can set up to
measure things like ITLB misses, DTLB misses, cycles spent doing
tablewalks for ITLB misses and DTLB misses, etc.  I hacked up a
measurement of the misses and total cycles doing tablewalks during a
kernel compile and got an average of 36 cycles per DTLB miss and 40
cycles per ITLB miss on a 500MHz G4 machine.  What I need to do now is
to put some better infrastructure for using those counters in place
and try your program using those counters instead of the timebase.
Paul.
