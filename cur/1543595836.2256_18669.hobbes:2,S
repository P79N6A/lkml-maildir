Subject: [PATCH] Config variable scripts

Hi Alan.
The enclosed patch was originally developed for the ELKS kernel, but
will apply equally well against any Linux kernel as it only adds new
scripts to the scripts subdirectory. The new scripts are as follows:
 1. renvar	Renames configuration variables in all files
		they occur in in the entire source tree.
 2. varlist	Lists all configuration variables currently
		in use, together with the number of files
		in which they occur.
Can you apply this against both the 2.2 and 2.4 trees please?
Best wishes from Riley.
