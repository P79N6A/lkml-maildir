This is how Nicholas stuff works, you can still get the kernel messages
by scrolling back. I'm told this meets S508.

Actually some of this is true for sighted people. You only get console
messages after PCI is initialised, until then they are queued away or
only on serial console.
If you are using a conventional BIOS then the first kernel messages being
readable as they occur versus just after seems to have only a little value.
If you have a fully accessible LinuxBIOS thats something quite different.
In that case can you use a Linuxbios hook for the console speech until
user space takes over ?
