It is not a problem about chars signedness (i suppose it depends
on processor ops with bytes, if it uses them as signed or unsiged, do sign
extensions and so on...).
The problem is that a function expecting a 'char' is given a 'signed char'
or 'unsigned char'. Just type the arguments the way they are expected.
On PPC, 'char' argument will be unsigned and 'char' parameter also. What
does strcpy() internally doesn't matter. Fine.
