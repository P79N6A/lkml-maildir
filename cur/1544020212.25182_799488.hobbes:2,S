Since the commit msg of 01e3eb8 says:
    kernel_locked() is not a valid test in IRQ context (we update the
    BKL's ->lock_depth and the preempt count separately and non-atomicalyy),
    so we cannot put it into the generic preempt debugging checks which
    can run in IRQ contexts too.
Another possibility would be writing it like:
  if (DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(val > preempt_count() -
			  (in_interrupt() ? 0 : !!kernel_locked())))
Which might just work because we're in sub_preempt_count, before we
actually do the subtraction, so in_interrupt() will still be true.
