The heuristics and tunables are more what ended up being useful with this
module, which could trivially be abstracted out. The focus of the lowmem
module was mostly giving userspace an opportunity to change its behaviour,
and to try to save critical state. I don't know how well this would map
to the Android use cases, though.
