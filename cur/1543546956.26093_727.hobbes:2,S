Hello,
   When posting a patch regarding changes to files in drivers/block and
drivers/char , please CC me personally also. I don't always find time to
go through the l-k emails. I am currently in the middle of auditing the
drivers/block and drivers/char files for locking issues. Thanks. 
Regards,
Frank Davis
