yup.  But there are so many ways to cripple a Linux box once you have local
access.  Another means which happens to be bug-induced doesn't seem
important.

I'd place information leaks and privilege escalations into their own class,
way above "yet another local DoS".
A local privilege escalation hole should be viewed as seriously as a remote
privilege escalation hole, given the bugginess of userspace servers, yes?
