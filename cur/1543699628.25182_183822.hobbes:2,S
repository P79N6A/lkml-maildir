Wish I knew about that earlier, unfortunately I've gone back to the 2.4.22 kernel as these are production boxes and I can't afford any more of these outages.  Besides I'm tired of getting paged at 4am :)  I wish I could get my development boxes to have this problem since it's not a big deal if they go down.
What kind of hardware are you running?  These are Compaq DL360 G1 servers.
