Yes, I think both issue should be fixed for 2.6.20 : the compile problem
with the OF glue -and- removing the default y.
The later should get picked up by Paulus, I'll make sure it is
tomorrow. 
The former, well, since it seems it doesn't mixup too much with my
patches, greg, you can probably send it to linus now if you think it
looks good (I haven't looked too closely at Sylvain patches myself).
Ben.
