... which is undesirable to say the very least for cross-platform Unix
(even worse, Unix + Windows) applications, so applications won't ever use
it (until Linux + super-duper filesystem is more than, say, 80% of the
market). I.e., it won't happen soon enough for this to make sense right
now. Perhaps in 13 more years...

Careful threading there... calling respected people names without any proof
isn't exactly great PR.

Your opinion. Some people disagree.

You seem to be blinded by the "success effect": You only ever see the ones
who succeed, you don't see the masses who tried to be "first movers" and
failed utterly.

Iff the performance of the FS is better _at doing what the system wants
than the system itself_. That the CVS is simpler/faster is no use
whatsoever if the underlying OS is more complex/slower. Besides, what is
ideal for CVS isn't necesarily good for word processing or databases, and
probably irrelevant or at least overkill for a lot of other applications,
which all end up paying the costs.
Concentrate on giving what _most_ applications want, make it possible for
applications with weird requirements to do their job.

Right. But it doesn't make the design of text editing, or word processing,
or mail handling, or... hideous, does it? Having a strong background in an
area does put blinds on one's eyes.

I recently saw (preliminary) numbers directly contradicting this somewhere.

By which the performance lead (if any) will do down the drain. There ain't
no free lunch.

Why on earth should Linux copy a niche system? By now Linux's marketshare
is _much_ larger than Apple's... I'd say it is the other way around: Apple
tries desperately to differentiate itself from MSFT (and traditional Unix +
Linux) in order not to dissapear (and keep their grip on their users). If
they are doing it right, only time will tell. But that is no reason to
screw up Linux' strengths.
