Well, I didn't realize the patch you sent via mm-commits and the one  
here are actually different.  I noticed that mm-commits one has:
+       if ((gfp_mask & (__GFP_FS|__GFP_IO)) != __GFP_FS|__GFP_IO) {
vs
+       if ((gfp_mask & (__GFP_FS|__GFP_IO)) != (__GFP_FS|__GFP_IO)) {
The second seems to make more sense.  I tested with the first last  
night which didn't help.
With the proper patch in place things look good.  Is this a candidate  
for 2.6.20-stable?
