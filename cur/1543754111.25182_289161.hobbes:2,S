statfs64 indeed.

No, but I do have some more information. A e2fsck run on that filesystem
was just as interesting:
/dev/md4: clean, 16/132480 files, -15514/264960 blocks
Forcing an e2fsck revelated a few groups with incorrect block counts:
Free blocks count wrong for group #2 (34308, counted=32306).
Free blocks count wrong for group #6 (45805, counted=32306).
Free blocks count wrong for group #8 (14741, counted=2354).
Free blocks count wrong (280474, counted=252586).
After fixing those everything returned to normal. I did run dumpe2fs
on the filesystem, if that is interesting I can retrieve and post that.
Wichert.
