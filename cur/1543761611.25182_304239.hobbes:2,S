You fixed the wrong code. The pci-nommu code is only used
when IOMMU is disabled in the Kconfig. But most kernels have
it enabled. You would need to change it in pci-gart.c too.
The reason it is like this that nommu was always intended as a hackish kludge
that would be only used for debugging - little did we know that
it would become standard later.
