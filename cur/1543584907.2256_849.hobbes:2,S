Built in scsi adapter drivers are probed in the order in
which they appear in drivers/scsi/Makefile (in the lk 2.4
series). Adapters can be assigned to host numbers using
the "scsihosts" kernel boot option (but this will not
differentiate between 2 adapters controlled by the same 
driver (e.g. 2 29160 cards)). Scsi buses are scanned for
devices in ascending order.
If you have lots of SCSI devices then devfs is your friend.
