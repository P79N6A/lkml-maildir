I disagree.
If it's not ccNUMA, then the different nodes should run _different_
copies of the OS, and you'd basically have a multi-OS system rather than
single image.  Non-cache-coherent hardware simply is not worth handling
as a single image, I suspect.
So at least right now my personal plan would be to consider non-cc NUMA
to be just a cluster.  Multiple machines backed with a fast
interconnect, and communication between them happens as if they were
separate machines (and the fast interconnect is then used as a way to
make those separate machines able to communicate with each other really
well). 
Most current/modern NUMA designs are ccNUMA anyway, as far as I can
tell.  I don't know of anybody who seriously makes a non-cc machine any
more.  People know how to make efficient cache controllers, and it just
makes the machines _soo_ much more usable that anybody who isn't cache
coherent really deserves to be ridiculed.
