That's the simplest method I can think of to prevent impossible
combinations such as CONFIG_FB=m, CONFIG_BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE=y
without having to use 'depend' or 'select' in Kconfig, or God forbid,
inter_module_get().
I should have added a comment that I also don't like the hackishness
of this method.
Thinking about this a little more carefully now, how about we just statically
link the fb notification?
I'll see if I can send an update for that.
