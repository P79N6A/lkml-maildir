OK, "xxx :1;" looks major, too :)

The access is really over RAM, not MMIO.  So it should be OK to access
in that way.  But volatile seems superfluous.  I'll get rid of it.
Also, msleep() in the removal should be synchronize_irq().
I'll fix these changes and commit with your space fixes to ALSA tree.
