Note that right-shift rounds towards negative infinity, while divide 
rounds towards zero.
If the operands are unsigned, then rsh and divide will yield the same 
instructions (on x86).  OTOH, if they are signed, then you get different 
results.  For this rsh, obviously, you get a shift, but for divide, you 
get something like this:
; divide edx by 2
mov ecx,edx
lsr ecx,31
asr edx,1
add edx,ecx
