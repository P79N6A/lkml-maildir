The option only makes sense with the default being restrictive.  But
making that default for all filesystems can't be done, because that
would immediately break thousands of existing installations.
I think this makes some sense for unprivileged mounts, but otherwise
not really.  If sysadmin is not careful about where the mounts go,
tough luck on him.
