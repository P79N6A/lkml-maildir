We've run out of non-rt signals. We could bump this up a bit and if
we do decide to it should be done _now_ to minimize and ABI breakage
later on (I've been looking at such a thing myself recently).
The sticky part is -- I'm not sure how well this will work with glibc
as it seems to have similar assumptions in there.
I really hope that if we do even need to extend this, we don't end up
with multiple signal system calls to maintain backwards
compatibility, such a thing is horribly ugly IMO.
