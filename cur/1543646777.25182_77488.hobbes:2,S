   2) Not inlining inb() and friend reduce the bloat but then you further 
      impact performances on CPUs which are generally many order of magnitude 
      slower than current desktop machines.
I don't buy this one.  You are saying that the overhead of a procedure
call is larger than the overhead of going out over the I/O bus to
touch a device?
