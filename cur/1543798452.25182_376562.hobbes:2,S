And to convert almost all calls to down/up to mutex_{down,up}. At which
point, it no longer makes sense to share the same data-type for
semaphore and mutex.
Also, (as was already mentioned several times) having separate data-type
for mutex makes code easier to understand, as it specifies intended
usage.
To avoid duplicating code, mutex can be implemented on top of semaphore,
like
struct mutex {
        struct semaphore sema;
#ifdef DEBUG_MUTEX
        void *owner;
#endif
};
or something similar.

Sleeping on a semaphore "held" by the current thread is perfectly
reasonable usage of a generic counting semaphore, as it can be upped by
another thread.
