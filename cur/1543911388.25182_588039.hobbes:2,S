So ... if someone (!subscriber && !whitelisted) sends a message, it stays
put somewhere till you get to it and determine whether it is relevant or
not, and either (1) forward it on to the list if appropriate, or (2) drop
it if detected as spam. And no "notifications" are ever sent out to
genuine / well-meaning posters during this process. Right?

Fair enough, if my understanding (as mentioned above) is correct, then I
believe the patch achieved a greater purpose than what it was originally
sent out for!
