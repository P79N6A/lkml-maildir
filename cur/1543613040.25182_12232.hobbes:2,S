Subject: PATCH for Max. symbolic links followed in do_follow_link() in fs/namei.c.

Hello,
The comments for do_follow_link in fs/namei.c say the maximum number for
recursive symbolic links is 8, but somehow its been modified to 5.
This value used to be 8 before 2.4.12 version of the kernel.
A patch submitted for kernel 2.4.12 has changed the limit for
recursive symlinks (current->link_count) from 8 to 5( but the comment
has not changed).
Here is a patch to revert this number back to 8.
I have not subscribed to lkml.
So,please reply to me at "rsreelat@in.ibm.com".
thanks,
Sreelatha.
