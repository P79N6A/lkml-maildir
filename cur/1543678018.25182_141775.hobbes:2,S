Now I understand.  Tom Rini forwarded me the output from gcc -E.  The
problem is that CONFIG_PCI_DOMAIN is conditional on CONFIG_PCI.  So ppc
& ia64 define a macro for pci_domain_nr, then PCI_DOMAIN isn't set, so
the default definition of pci_domain_nr happens ... and gets mutilated
by the macro:
static inline int ((struct pci_controller *)( struct pci_bus *bus)->sysdata)->index  { return 0; }
A bit subtle, that ... I think this patch is fine, though perhaps it'd
be best to unconditionally make CONFIG_PCI_DOMAIN true as well?
