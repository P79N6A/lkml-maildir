A "policy" is a simplification that isn't needed.
This fix could trivially be proved not to make things worse, so
no reason at all to omit it.  Policies, rules-of-thumb etc.
is for management and others without detail knowledge.
Those who know better shouldn't be limited by such rules.
And they aren't. :-)
Of course it is possible to write down a detailed policy
that even expert coders could agree to - but why bother?
You wouldn't get it into a few lines...
