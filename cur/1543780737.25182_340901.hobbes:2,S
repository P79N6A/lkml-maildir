As you may or may not remember I have a response benchmark, which does 
different things... And one of the things I found is that when trying to 
determine if a tuning was "better" was to look at the 90 and/or 95 
percentile value. The max, average, and SD give you information which 
may be hard to really understand, but the "mostly better than X" times 
are pretty easy to understand.
I finally wound up using a dynamic percentile thing of my own creation, 
but there's no supporting theory, I just looked with response curve 
shapes and found a way to get numbers useful to me.
So you might find the percentile values pull additional information out 
of your data points, particularly for noisy results.
