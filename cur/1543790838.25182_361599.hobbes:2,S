This won't work, I think.
sparse basically always creates a _new_type_ for a bitwise typedef, so 
when you do
	typedef u16 __bitwise le16;
	typedef u16 __bitwise be16;
	...
your new "le16" will be _different_ from the old __le16, and you can't use 
it with "cpu_to_le16()" and other things.
I think that
	typedef __le16 le16;
should do what you want, but you should check.
