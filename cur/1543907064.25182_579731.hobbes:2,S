Yep, you work around this one by enabling polling.

Yes, this one is uglier. But maybe "enable polling automatically +
ignore any updates from bios" (+ maybe "only enable lowering") is
better solution than "just remove the knob"? After all, "the knob" is
still useful for debugging at least.

This is okay as long as you are willing to work around the fundamental
problems in kernel. You are unable to _fix_ them. They are broken
BIOSes.
