What would i2c-sysfs.h be needed for?  All of the needed sysfs prototype

No userspace program should rely on kernel header files.
And I didn't take away the functionality that i2c-proc.h provided with
the list of devices supported and such.  Just the unused function
prototypes that dealt with the proc and sysctl interface.
