we were talking about the load order. This will solve the load order,  
but if we have races like the kind you described, then the whole mISDN  
design is broken. So if that is the fact, then my understanding is  
that we have too many modules. Simple combine the modules and use  
proper locking. More modules is not always better.

Report this to the USB mailing list.
