Well, this is very strange indeed.  Sometime during the night, this
machine came back to life and continued executing the test suite. 
According to the logs, it ran the tests for approximately 7 hours, then
became unresponsive again.  It is currently in the "zombie" state
described above: Magic Sysrq doesn't give anything but the name of the
command, and a shell I have opened on a VC won't echo any characters.  I
guess we'll see if it resurrects itself again.
Manfred mentioned that Sysrq tries to take the task queue spinlock.  Is
there some segment of code in the kernel which would cause a process to
grab the task queue spinlock and hold it for a long time under heavy
memory contention?
I should mention that the job mix induced by the test suite would be
considered unreasonable in a normal environment.
