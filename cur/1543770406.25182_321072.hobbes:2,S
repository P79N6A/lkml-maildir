Ok - I'll resubmit that patch.  Hopefully you can reply to that
resubmitted patch with an "Acked-by: ..."
Andrew withdrew the original patch, when it became a matter needing
further discussion.

Yes - that is a good and valid point.
I also lack any real evidence of a scaling problem.  It's just a
theoretical concern.  My unreliable weather forecast is that it will be
a while before it's a serious concern.
This means I am willing to take simple measures to minimize the concern,
but I'd prefer to await hard evidence of the problem before trying more
ambitious measures.

My impression is that cpusets has two classes of users:
 1) Extreme HPC apps, scaling to hundreds or thousands of CPUs, and
 2) More mixed or service oriented apps, with less extreme scaling.
I also suspect that it is the second class that most requires
notify_on_release.  The extreme HPC guys have less need for
notify_on_release.
So I find a solution that lets one trade off extreme scaling versus
heavier use of notify_on_release to be appealing, if it can be done
trivially, as this patch does.
