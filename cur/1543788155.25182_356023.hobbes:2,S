If you were going to do it right here's what you would do:
People who had files in /tmp would have no rights at all to other users 
/tmp files.
Listing the dirtectory would only display the files you had some access 
to. If you have no rights you don't even see that the file is there.
The effect would be like giving people their own tmp directories.
