There are bad bug reports, but not all bug reports are that bad.
What if the quality of the bug report is good and the submitter is 
responsive, and there's still zero reaction?
Let's make an example:
Since the first list I sent immediately after 2.6.19-rc1 was released, 
kernel Bugzilla #7255 is part of my list of 2.6.19-rc regressions but 
has gotten exactly zero developer responses.
What exactly were the mistakes of the submitter resulting in noone 
caring about Bugzilla #7255?
