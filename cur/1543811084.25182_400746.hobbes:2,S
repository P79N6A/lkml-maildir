In that case you should be worried not about acquiring and releasing the 
rwsem at the beginning and end of blocking_notifier_call_chain; you should 
be worried about all the RCU serialization in the core 
notifier_call_chain routine.
In fact, that could be changed for blocking notifier chains.  Since we own 
the readlock, we know that the list won't get changed while we're using 
it.  So the blocking version of the call-chain routine could avoid using 
the RCU dereferencing mechanism.
The atomic chains are a different matter.  The ones that don't run in NMI 
context could use an rw-spinlock for protection, allowing them also to 
avoid memory barriers while going through the list.  The notifier chains 
that do run in NMI don't have this luxury.  Fortunately I don't think 
there are very many of them.
