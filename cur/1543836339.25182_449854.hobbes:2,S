Very strange output actually - comments in the code say that frame size
can not exceed 0x3f00, but in this log it is much more than 16128 and
that is after sizeof(struct skb_shared_info) has been removed...
Could you please remove debug output and run some network stress test in
parallel with high disk/memory activity to check if that does not break
your system and watch /proc/slabinfo for 16k and 32k sized pools.
