Ah, again. :) Rusty Lynch and me tried something similar at leat twice but 
with no avail. 
We had a modular OOM killers infrastructure with two new killers. One 
would just panic on OOM situation, and other did account for parents which 
repeatedly spawned 'bad' children. Some people called it 'a bit right 
winged'. :)
Take a look at

 if you are interested. I did not 
sync it with the latest kernel since nobody was interested. It worked for 
me.
