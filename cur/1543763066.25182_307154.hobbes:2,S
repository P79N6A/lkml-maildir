So you're saying, let the machine come all the way up, log in as root, 
"echo 8:5 > /sys/power/resume" (I think that was the name), then "echo 
resume > /sys/power/state"?  Hmm, you would have to bypass "swapon -a",
e.g. boot with the -b kernel parameter.  
Or I'll bet one could do something equivalent in the initrd -- much more 
user friendly.  But the friendliest of all would be if the swsusp resume 
call were not a late_initcall but rather were called just before the root 
was mounted, after the initrd (if any) had loaded whatever modules.  I 
think you're confirming that that approach would not blow up the kernel -- 
if it will work with the root mounted and user space in full roar (well, 
skimpy roar with the -b switch), then it's got to be OK at the earlier 
time.
I'll see what I can do.
