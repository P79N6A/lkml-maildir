Or the other way around:
An NFS client writing 50 MB/s to a server. The NFS server keeps up with
the amount of traffic (i.e.: no "NFS server stops responding" on the
client) and manages to write the data to the disks but the load average
on the server goes to ~16 without any major CPU usage.

I get the impression it's not only a network problem. You can also
increase the load by copying a large file from one disk to another (of
course using a large blocksize to eliminate a high number of syscalls),
so it looks like waiting on local I/O is the problem.
With modern disk subsystems (i.e.: anything except IDE in PIO mode) a
high IO load shouldn't really burn many CPU cycles. IMHO the load
average should account this differently.
The current load average calculation is a great way for a DoS attack
for programs that look at the load average like Exim and Sendmail: just
generate enough IO load on the machine to get the load above a certain
threshold and you will get a temporary error on SMTP. One way to do
such a thing (and effectively creating a remote DoS) is what Russell
said: lots of people downloading FC5 images through vsftpd. Vsftpd uses
sendfile() to pump out files, which (among other things) was made in
order to work around large system loads. It certainly does, but
unfortunately it's not accounted as such.
