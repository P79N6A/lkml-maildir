Good point, I have not used LILO since about Slackware 8.1, or any system w/o 
initrd in ages. I suppose there is a benefit to running without initrd, but I 
confess that I can't remember what it is. So I don't immediately consider the 
issues and limitations if you run without initrd.
Well I answered how to GET the UUID, he didn't ask me how to USE it. And I 
certainly didn't think of it, even though the info was there. :-(
