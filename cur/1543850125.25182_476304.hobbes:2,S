That dereference should never be possible.  If sysctl registration fails, 
it should not be left partially initialized so that it would ever need to 
be cleaned up later; it should just fail to register.  So the fix, if 
indeed one is required in this instance that you have witnessed, should be 
an immediate response to an -ENOMEM on register_sysctl_table.  Adding this 
to atalk_unregister_sysctl is incorrect because that function should only 
be entered given the condition that the register was successful, which in 
this case it was not.
