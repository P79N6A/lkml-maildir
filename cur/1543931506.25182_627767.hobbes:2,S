Also, most of the drivers should/could be doing the same thing. It is 
seems that
driver writers just want to get "creative" and do things differently. 
The code is
cleaner, safer, and less buggy if every device uses the interface in the 
same way.
When I did the initial pass on this, I didn't see a single variation on 
NAPI usage
that was better than the simple "get N packets and return" variation.  
But Dave
did way more detailed grunt work on this.
