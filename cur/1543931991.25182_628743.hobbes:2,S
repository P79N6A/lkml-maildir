Applied.
Stephen, you often don't supply a proper signoff line
for one-off changes like this and I find it very irritating.
It doesn't cost you anything to hit one or two keys in your
outgoing email editor to include the signoff line.
So please do so, or I'll silently drop patches without them
in the future.
Thanks.
