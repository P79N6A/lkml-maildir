I don't think it will ever be used with SPARC, so your patch is Ok.

If LIME chip should ever be used with SPARC, support for this
could be added later. LIME doesn't have PCI interface, it is
connected to the host cpu bus. PCI version of the driver is for
CoralP and Carmine chips which have PCI interface.
