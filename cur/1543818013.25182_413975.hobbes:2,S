The removal was introduced to get rid of old modules from an earlier
build of the same kernel with potential more modules.
I was obvious when I played with an allmodconfig kernel IIRC.
The usecase you have in mind is with external modules only?
We could special case in that suation and avoid the removal.
I see no way to detect when it is OK to remove or not, so in the
principle of least suprise I prefer having the removal unconditional for
normal kernel builds, and no removal for external modules.
OK?
