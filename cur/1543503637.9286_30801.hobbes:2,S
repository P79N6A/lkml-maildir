Hm, I always thought that there simply is no other timer available, but
you could be right: the refresh counter could serve as a reference. You
just have to find out whether it runs at 1024, 2048, or 4096 Hz ("fast"
refresh option in some chipsets). All the other timers are abused by other
parts of the system.
