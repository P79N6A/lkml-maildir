Just do what ipip and gre do, use a network device with a fixed name
for the ioctl (you already have the ethip0 device for this purpose it

The iproute changes are only a few lines, just add the ethip0 device to
the do_add, do_del, ... commands and set the protocol to IPPROTO_ETHERIP
when an etherip tunnel is requested.
