I can tell you its worse. I don't have to demonstrate anything, more
atomic RMW ops in the page fault path is going to have an impact.
I'm not saying we must not compromise *anywhere*, but it would
just be nice to try to avoid making the path heavier, that's all.
I'm not being purist when I say I'd first rather explore all other
options before adding atomics.
But nevermind arguing, it appears Linus' suggested method will
be fine and *does* mean we don't have to compromise.
