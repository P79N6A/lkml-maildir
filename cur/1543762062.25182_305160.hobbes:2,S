The first looks fine.  I am part way through reviewing the second, and 
so far only found one change (see following) that I question.  I prefer 
to keep the local variables together without a blank line between them.  
Is there a global Linux style compliance issue here?  By the way, it is 
not common to use typedefs but you will see a few in this function since 
the network protocol specification describes the format of the wire 
protocol using them and it makes the structure names match the standard.
 static char *nxt_dir_entry(char *old_entry, char *end_of_smb)
 {
-	char * new_entry;
-	FILE_DIRECTORY_INFO * pDirInfo = (FILE_DIRECTORY_INFO *)old_entry;
+	char *new_entry;
+
+	FILE_DIRECTORY_INFO *pDirInfo = (FILE_DIRECTORY_INFO *)old_entry;
I will apply at least a few of them, but I am busy doing a high priority 
fix to handle split transact2 responses (which could cause an oops in ls 
to some servers so is high priority - although it only occurs on large 
directories, and if the server decides to send two transact responses 
for one request (which is not that common) and a search entry is split 
in certain ways across two SMB responses).
