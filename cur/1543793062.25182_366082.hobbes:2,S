Hello, Christoph
We have fixed most of your complains.
Would you be so kind to find some time and take a quick look at reiser4
(2.6.14-rc5-mm1 +
ftp://ftp.namesys.com/pub/reiser4-for-2.6/2.6.14-rc5-mm1/broken-out-3
)
However, there are some problems:

I hope it is in better state now, still not perfect, though.

this is not fixed yet, but it is on top of todo list. We need to find correct
way to understand when file can be packed.

Sorry, I am not sure what do you mean here. reiser4' getattr looks similar to
generic_fillattr but does few things differently. Please explain what is wrong
by your opinion.

We are willing to improve reiser4 code in incremental way.
Please do not consider this additional comment as a major reason to not let
reiser4 to get included.
