Is there a defined behaviour for what happens when a process with an epoll
fd forks?
I've an app that inherits an epoll fd from its parent, and then
unregisters some file descriptors from the epoll set. This seems to have
the nasty side effect of unregistering the same file descriptors from the
parent process as well. Surely this can't be right?
This is on 2.6.2.
