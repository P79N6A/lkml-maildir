What happens with an AIX base install is that a message comes up on each
device which says "press 1 to use this device as the system console" (or
2, etc, for serial consoles, or F1 for a graphics head).  IMHO, if a VGA
card or keyboard is installed is not a good reason to pick that device,
in case another method is desired.
Cheers, Andreas
