Yes - a lot of trouble.
As far as I can see, the space between 256 and 511 is never used.
More in particular, there are lots of places where the kernel
seems to assume that only 256 is used.
So, instead of requiring new ioctls and new loadkeys etc
I would prefer to make NR_KEYS 256, if possible.
So the question is: why did you require 512?
