Nothing special so far, UP and SMP binaries for every kernel out there.
Oh, and of course you need to provide the about seven versions
specifically optimised for a certain type of CPU, so that makes
fourteen binaries per kernel version. It's only a small amount of work,
right?

And you're serious you trust *that*? Give me a day and I'll get
readable source back: start with indent, load source in an editor, and
use search and replace to get decent identifiers back. OK, it's not the
original source, but it can certainly be used to improve the driver.
You really underestimate the inventiveness of other people.

Your first idea only showed that you already have quite a lot of work
for each kernel version, and that it will only become worse with each
architecture you add to your pool of supported systems. I think you
nicely pointed out why having binary-only drivers is a bad idea from a
maintainability perspective.
