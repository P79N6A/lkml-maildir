Francois,
     Yes, I'm aware of the DMA mapping and pci_set_dma_mask() options. 
As I stated, this is just the 1st patch for the DMA code. The 
"interesting" parts will be included in a future patch (possibly by the 
driver developers), as well as appropriate option for pci_set_dma_mask() 
such as returning an error code or jumping to some code to return. This 
goes for all of my recent DMA patches.
Regards,
Frank
