Those seem like useful things, but it would also be nice for LTTng to
support things brought forward by other tracers too.
GTSC comes from something I posted last year called 'UTT', for 'Unified
Trace Transport':
http://www.ecos.sourceware.org/ml/systemtap/2006-q4/msg00026.html
I wasn't comfortable with the word 'Unified' then, either, since I
thought it was presumptuous (so 'unified' was dropped, and 'generic'
used instead - basically it just means that any tracing application can
use it, not that it attempts to subsume all other tracers).
The idea was to see if the blktrace code could be generalized so that it
could be used for other tracing applications besides block layer
tracing.  The test case was to get systemtap running on top of the
blktrace transport, and it seemed to work fine.  As part of that patch
set, I also posted a couple patches that did the same thing but on top
of LTTng, which also worked fine:
http://www.ecos.sourceware.org/ml/systemtap/2006-q4/msg00028.html
http://www.ecos.sourceware.org/ml/systemtap/2006-q4/msg00027.html
But I never got any comments about it, so I assumed it wasn't something
you were interested in.  In any case, do you really think everyone who
wants to do tracing should wait around for LTTng to get into the kernel
lock, stock, and barrel?  It's been awhile since I did this experiment,
but do you think LTTng is ready today to function as the transport for
systemtap?  How hard do you think it would it be to modify blktrace to
run on top of the the LTTng tracing infrastructure?  My guess is that if
the answers were 'yes' and 'not hard', then LTTng could basically 'own'
tracing and the rest of us could move on to more interesting things.

This is just example code in the documentation.  There is no actual
gtsc_printf() in the code.
