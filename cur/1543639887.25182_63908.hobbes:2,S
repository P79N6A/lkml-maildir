  [PATCH] HCDs support new DMA APIs (part 2 of 2)
  
  - teaches the shared "hcd" code to set urb->*_dma whenever the device
    driver didn't, by creating singleshot mappings.

  [PATCH] HCDs support new DMA APIs (part 1 of 2)
  
  -  teaches the hardware-specific code to
     use urb->*_dma instead of creating mappings.
     (And tells ohci-sa1111 to init its buffer pools.)
     EHCI and UHCI also eliminated duplicated state;
     all the HCDs are now a smidgeon smaller.
  
  Sanity checked by enumerating, including through
  a hub, and using a USB Ethernet adapter, with each
  of the three host controllers.
  
  Worth noting:  this removes pci_dma_sync_single()
  calls from UHCI.  On x86 (and some others) that's
  a NOP, but for UHCI on other platforms (rare except
  maybe on IA64, as I understand) this anticipates
  the upcoming patch to remove interrupt automagic.
  (I'll likely submit that after a Linus release that
  catches up to your USB tree. :)
