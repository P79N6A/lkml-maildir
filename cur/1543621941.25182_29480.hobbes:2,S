I have several kernel panic on server running with a Asus A7A266
(chipset Ali M1647 North Bridge and M1535D South Bridge) and a Athlon XP
1600+
I run 2.4.17 kernel.
Are there any bugs with this Motherboard/Chipset/CPU?
The 2.4.18-rc2 or the 2.4.18-rc2-ac1 might help to fix the problem?
I run a _very_ conservative bios settings, but the kelnel panic halt the
machine at least on time every day... :-(
Any help? :-)[unhandled content-type:application/x-pkcs7-signature]
