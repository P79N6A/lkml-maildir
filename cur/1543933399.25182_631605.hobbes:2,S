Almost completely.
Patch below removes pci_enable_device_bars() from Documentation/pci.txt .
(And I'd be happy to review patches to pci.txt that add
  pci_enable_device_io() and _mmio() as well. )

-10. pci_enable_device_bars() and Legacy I/O Port space
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-Large servers may not be able to provide I/O port resources to all PCI
-devices. I/O Port space is only 64KB on Intel Architecture[1] and is
-likely also fragmented since the I/O base register of PCI-to-PCI
-bridge will usually be aligned to a 4KB boundary[2]. On such systems,
-pci_enable_device() and pci_request_region() will fail when
-attempting to enable I/O Port regions that don't have I/O Port
-resources assigned.
-
-Fortunately, many PCI devices which request I/O Port resources also
-provide access to the same registers via MMIO BARs. These devices can
-be handled without using I/O port space and the drivers typically
-offer a CONFIG_ option to only use MMIO regions
-(e.g. CONFIG_TULIP_MMIO). PCI devices typically provide I/O port
-interface for legacy OSes and will work when I/O port resources are not
-assigned. The "PCI Local Bus Specification Revision 3.0" discusses
-this on p.44, "IMPLEMENTATION NOTE".
-
-If your PCI device driver doesn't need I/O port resources assigned to
-I/O Port BARs, you should use pci_enable_device_bars() instead of
-pci_enable_device() in order not to enable I/O port regions for the
-corresponding devices. In addition, you should use
-pci_request_selected_regions() and pci_release_selected_regions()
-instead of pci_request_regions()/pci_release_regions() in order not to
-request/release I/O port regions for the corresponding devices.
