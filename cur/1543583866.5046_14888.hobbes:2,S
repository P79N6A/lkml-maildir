Ho humm..
Anybody who has any ideas or input, please holler.  There are no actual
BusLogic controller changes in the current 2.4.3-pre kernels at all, so
there's something else going on.
There's a new aic7xxx driver there - did you enable support for that? I
wonder if there could be some inter-action: the aic7xxx driver tries to
probe every PCI SCSI controller because they are basically hard to ID
any other way (no single vendor/id combination, or even a simple
pattern).  But it has some rather careful internal logic to filter out
all non-aic7xxx controllers, so this really doesn't look likely.
If you didn't compile aic7xxx in, the only other SCSI change (apart from
a lot of spelling fixes in comments etc) is some trivial error handling,
like changing scsi_test_unit_ready to not have a result buffer (because
it doesn't have a result except for the regular sense buffer).  Which
again certainly shouldn't be able to matter at all. 
Ideas?
