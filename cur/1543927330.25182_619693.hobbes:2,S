Good morning to everyone.
I'm working to sort out what appear to be issues with binding of the
serial_cs driver to a PCMCIA wireless card (Zoom).
Card works perfectly in recent 2.6.2[23] kernels if cardmgr is running
and PCMCIA_IOCTL support is in the kernel.  The serial_cs driver
fails, however, to bind in a pure hotplug configuration.  The hotplug
scripts detect card insertion and load the serial_cs module but the
driver doesn't bind to the device.
The slot number (0.0 or 1.0) appears in the /sys/bus/pcmcia/devices
directory after card insertion.  The serial_cs directory also presents
in the /sys/bus/pcmcia/drivers directory secondary to module load.
I've tried to manually echo the device number (0.0 or 1.0) into the
/sys/bus/pcmcia/drivers/serial_cs/bind pseudo-file but nothing
happens.  The device number is present as a binding if cardmgr frobs
things with the pcmcia_ioctl bind commands.
I'm willing to hack on the kernel a bit if additional information or
debugging is needed.
Thanks for any thoughts or guidance.
Best wishes for a productive week.
