In addition I'm involved in a NUMA-related project that might have
zone-normal on other nodes beside node0.  I also think that in some cases it
might be useful to have the code above and below in case of AMD machines
that have less than 1GB per processor (or at least less than 1GB on the
FIRST processor).

As noted above, this is possible, the cost of this code is not much, so I
would keep it in.
