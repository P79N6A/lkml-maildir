I'm sure there's a way to pass the kallsyms_num_syms value directly by way of
the linker rather than consigning it to a bit of memory.
The immediately obvious way is to declare it to be at an address that it the
symbol count value, and then C can do "&kallsyms_num_syms" to get at it.
Horrible, I know, but I'm not sure it's worse than some of the other stuff we
do.
