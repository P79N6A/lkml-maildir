 I am pretty darn sure my name can be spelled correctly, but can it be 
reasonably assured to be printed correctly on a reasonable subset of 
systems out there?  Considering Linux only -- does our text-mode VGA 
console driver make any effort to print an arbitrary UTF-8-encoded text 
correctly?  What does it do when it runs beyond the limit of 512 
characters?  And how about serial terminals?
 When such issues are resolved and a reasonable subset of people, say 80%, 
either have or can make -- without unnecessary hassle -- their systems 
working properly in this respect, I can start thinking about using the 
correct spelling of my name.
 Until then I would rather work on code, sorry.  And that is not going to 
be any code related to UTF-8 either, but I do encourage anybody who really 
cares about it to address any or all issues raised above. :-)
