Ouch.

I don't think there's anything to stop me doing two O_DIRECT read()s
from the same bit of a file at the same time.  As far as I can see, this
should be easily triggered by user-space.
And if you get corruption in a filesystem such that two files share the
same block, then this possibility arises again.  That can happen due to
corruption in an indirect block (ext2/3) or in the reiserfs tree; or
more commonly due to a bitmap block getting corrupted, resulting in the
same block being allocated twice.
This is a situation we really need to handle.  ext3 goes to great
lengths to make sure that if such cases happen, the worst that results
should be the filesystem taking itself readonly cleanly.
It's really bad behaviour for a fault such as a bad IDE cable to be able
to oops the entire kernel.

It certainly shouldn't do so for buffered IO if things are running fine,
but as soon as you get corrupt data, or start using O_DIRECT, it's
possible.
