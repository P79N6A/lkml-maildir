Hello All
             As per the discussion in the thread with subject as
Patch Related with Fork Bombing Attack on LKML,I have modified my
patch. I request you for the inclusion of my attached patch named
"fork.patch".
Summery of the Patch:
This patch Warns the administrator about the fork bombing attack
(whenever any user is crossing its process limit). I have used
printk_ratelimit function in this patch. This function helps to
prevent flooding of syslog and prints message as per the values set by
root user in following files:-
1) /proc/sys/kernel/printk_ratelimit:- This file contains value for,
how many times message should be printed in syslog.
2) /proc/sys/kernel/printk_ratelimit_burst: - This file contains value
for, after how much time message should be repeated.
This patch is really helpful for administrator/root user from security
point of view. They can take action against attacker by looking at
syslog messages related with fork bombing attack.
Added comments will definitely help developers.
