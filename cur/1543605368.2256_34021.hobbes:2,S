eh? why? The GDT can hold up to 2 ** 16 bytes (limit is 16-bit). Each entry is 8
bytes, that means that there are 8192 possible 'slots' in the GDT. Each process
has 2 entries, an LDT and a task struct entry. Why is the limit 512? couldn't it
be about 4000? (Some entries are needed for APM and other things...)
