Sure, I was wrong to start this again, but try to get my position - I
really tired from trying to prove that I'm not a camel just because we
had some misunderstanding at the start.
I do think that threadlets are relly cool solution and are indeed very
good approach for majority of the parallel processing, but my point is
still that it is not a perfect solution for all tasks.
Just to draw a line: kevent example is extrapolation of what can be
achieved with event-driven model, but that does not mean that it must be
_only_ used for AIO model - threadlets _and_ event driven model (yes, I
accepted Ingo's point about its declining) is the best solution.

Ugh, no, that is very limited solution - memory must be either pinned
(which leads to dos and limited ring buffer), or callback must sleep.
Actually in any way there _must_ exist a queue - if ring buffer is full
event is not allowed to be dropped - it must be stored in some other
place, for example in queue from where entries will be read (copied)
which ring buffer will have entries (that is how it is implemented in
kevent at least).

Well, sockets are the files indeed, and sockets already are perfectly
handled by epoll - but there are other users of petential interace - and
it must be designed to scale in _any_ situation very well.
Even if we right now do not have problems with some types of events, we
must scale with any new one.

Well, we get epoll support for free, but we need to create tons of other
interfaces and infrastructure for kernel users, and we need to change 
userspace anyway.
But epoll support requires to have quite heavy bindings to file
structure, so why don't we want to design new interface (since we need
to change userspace anyway) so that it could allow to scale and be very
memory optimized from the beginning?
