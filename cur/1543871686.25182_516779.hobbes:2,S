There are two parts of at least my request.
The first part is, why should serial driver assert RTS when CRTSCTS is
not set and which problem may follow by changing this default behaviour.
The second part is that you are talking about. I don't see for a
moment some regular
way to preconfigure serial interface parameters before opening the
device, at the
same time current behaviour creates potentially dangerous RTS jerking
during device configuring.
May be it would be good idea to develop some tty control driver which
provides a
possibility to change default setting of the drivers?
