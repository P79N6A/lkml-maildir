I actually did do that in the first place, but wondered if it was the
right thing to introduce the accounting changes that came with that.
I'll change it back to io_schedule() and test it again, just to make
sure.
If that's the right fix, I can push it directly since it won't have any
dependencies on your patches.
Thanks,
Shaggy
