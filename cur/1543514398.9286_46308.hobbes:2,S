As replied earlier, I'm not using NFS (knfsd) and experience the "beyond
end of device" messages while doing extensive IO on a 4-way striped LV.
A single LV gives no problem. 
My setup is an NCR875 with 2x4Gb,2x8Gb and 2Gb for the rootdisk. 
A kernel compile on this LV, a database fill on both oracle or Sybase will
all trigger the bug.
Hope this helps a little.
