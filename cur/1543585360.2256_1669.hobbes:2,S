First number is in-use objects in that cache, second number is
currently-allocated objects in that cache.

Don't know.

Slab cache will shrink if there are whole pages which are empty (it may
be that they have to be at the end of the cache).  It is hard to tell
from the above numbers if any of the caches could shrink, because it
depends on the number of objects per page, and if there are any whole
pages without allocated objects.
