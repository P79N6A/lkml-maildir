    Well, as someone who has to administer a whole bunch of NT machines,
    I regret to inform you that NT does _not_ bluescreen constantly at
    either of the sites I administer.
    I wish it did, for then I could replace it with Linux or xBSD, and
    make the users use StarOffice instead of MS-Office.
    Is the NT kernel that much larger than Linux?   Sure, it takes three
    disks to bootstrap it, but a large part of that is drivers and the
    stage-1 installer, which is, in my experience, the thing that bloats
    up a Linux bootstrap to the point where you either have to use a
    compressed root filesystem or (shudder) multiple floppies to
    bootstrap.

                   \/  driver for the bootstrap I'd be pushing two (compressed)
