Thinking about this  i guess we have a problem with the above approach
i outlined. if we have one task that is waiting on the event and more
than one that can generate the event then the above logic would not
work. Also with cases other than vfork; logic of tracking the waiting
task gets complex. I guess what we have right now is better.
