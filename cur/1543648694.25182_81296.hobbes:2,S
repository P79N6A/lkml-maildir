That's bogus.  We call ->open() only for entire disk.

... and that is (a) obvious leak and (b) broken unless disk is already
open - it will try to do IO on bdev.
More interesting issue, though, is whether we need to bother with
complications coming from that interface anymore.  Notice that
comment re "too many device nodes" doesn't hold these days - that
sort of stuff looks like a candidate for "write command into node
on driverfs" - especially when we are talking about configuring
the device, shutting disks down/starting them up, etc.  Linus, Pat?
Unless I'm mistaken that's precisely the sort of work that is
supposed to live in driverfs...
