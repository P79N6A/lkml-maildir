Now that's clear to me.  Thanks for the explanation.

I was referring to the (not so far) future situation when we have compression
in the userland suspend/resume utilities.  The times of writing/reading the image
will be similar to yours and IMHO it's usually possible to free 1/2 of RAM
in a box with 512+ MB of RAM at a little cost as far as the responsiveness
after resume is concerned.  Thus on machines with 512+ MB of RAM
both solutions will give similar results performance-wise, but the
userland-driven suspend gives you much more flexibility wrt what you can
do with the image (eg. you can even send it over the network if need be).
On machines with less RAM suspend2 will probably be better preformance-wise,
and that may be more important than the flexibility.

Rafael
