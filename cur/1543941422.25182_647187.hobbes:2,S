But which 2 are not?  We can't add them to the -stable tree unless they
are.
Can you resend the ones that are already upstream, with the git commit
ids?  You did that with some, but not all, and more than 2, so I really
have no idea what to apply here.
So I guess I'll drop all of these, as I really don't want to go digging
to figure it out :(
