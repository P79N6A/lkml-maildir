OK, my plan is to do this:
1) Apply your patch to 2.6.6-current, build with PREEMPT
2) Test bk pull via ppp on reiserfs until and if it breaks.
3) Test bk pull via ppp on ext3 and take a look at the s.ChangeSet file
if/when the failure occurs.
4) Apply akpm's patch here:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=108478018304305&w=2
5) Repeat 2,3
Here I'm defining 2.6.6-current as what was current at around midnight
last night.  I'll keep that source tree as a constant.
I'll post the results either late tonight or tomorrow.
