It's not a bug.
Setting current state manually is fine _iff_ you don't actually test a 
condition value. It's only if you do
	/* This has a race, and is bad! */
	current->state = TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE;
	if (some_condition)
		schedule();
that you have a race: the CPU (or the compiler, for that matter) can move 
the "some_condition" check up to before setting TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, and if 
another CPU comes in and wakes you up, you might lose the wakeup.
But doing
	/* This is fine */
	current->state = TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE;
	schedule();
is fine.
