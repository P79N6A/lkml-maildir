I know this deals with the kernel, but unfortunately my company won't
consider using linux's firewalling w/o some document.  I'm not very
concerned where it comes from, but what I'd like is something that says it's
secure.  I realise that there are TCP wrappers (this is not a concern in
this case) and other programs.  It also doesn't matter if the doc says
something about 'as long as configured correctly'.  Just as long as there's
something that says "it's secure" somewhere is all I am interested in
finding.  (Of course, what good is a secure firewall that's badly
configured?)
