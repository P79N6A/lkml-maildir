I missed the git-newsetup.patch. I will change EFI runtime service patch
according to the git-newsetup.patch.
One question:
The boot_params.efi_info.efi_systab is defined as u32. But it should be
u64 on x86_64, because it comes from firmware and is not controlled by
bootloader. But, changing it from u32 to u64 will break current i386 EFI
support, should we change it and fix the i386 EFI bootloader?
