i think Andi was talking about the vast majority of the systems out 
there. For example, check out the arch demography of current Fedora 
installs (according to the Smolt opt-in UUID based user metrics):
   
http://smolt.fedoraproject.org/
   i686:     74743
   x86_64:   18599
   i386:      1208
   ppc:        527
   ppc64:      396
   sparc64:     14
   ---------------
   Total:    95488
even pure i386 (kernels, not systems) is a only 1.2% of all installs. By 
the time the CFS kernel gets into a distro (a few months at minimum, 
typically a year) this percentage will go down further. And embedded 
doesnt really care about task-statistics corner cases [ (it likely 
doesnt have 'top' installed - likely doesnt even have /proc mounted or 
even built in ;-) ].
of course CFS should not do _worse_ stats than what we had before, and 
should not break or massively misbehave. Also, anything sane we can do 
for low-resolution arches we should do (and we already do quite a bit - 
the while wmult stuff is to avoid expensive divisions) - and i regularly 
booted CFS with a low-resolution clock to make sure it works. So i'm not 
trying to duck anything, we've just got to keep our design priorities 
right :-)
