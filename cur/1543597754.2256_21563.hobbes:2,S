The qnxfs code is really quite stable - that's the first time in more than a
year that I hear of any problem reading a qnx file-system; actually, I've been
considering removing the 'experimental' tag, but now I'll reconsider...
Incidentally, I use the qnxfs in a production environment here (tried'em all
up to 2.4.7 - guess I'll better switch to 2.4.8 right now to check, although
the qnxfs code has not changed from 2.4.7)
I'll be very interested in hearing what you find out.
cheers
