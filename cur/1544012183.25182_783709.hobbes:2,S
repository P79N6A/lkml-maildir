Subject: [PATCH] UIO: Add missing documentation of features added recently
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/23/202

The following features were added to the UIO framework in the near past:
* Generic drivers for platform devices (uio_pdrv, uio_pdrv_genirq)
* an "offset" sysfs attribute for memory mappings
Unfortunately, all this went in without documentation (won't happen again...)
This patch updates UIO documentation.

+<title>Using uio_pdrv for platform devices</title>
+	<para>
+	In many cases, UIO drivers for platform devices can be handled in a
+	generic way. In the same place where you define your
+	<varname>struct platform_device</varname>, you simply also implement
+	your interrupt handler and fill your
+	<varname>struct uio_info</varname>. A pointer to this
+	<varname>struct uio_info</varname> is then used as
+	<varname>platform_data</varname> for your platform device.
+	</para>
+	<para>
+	You also need to set up an array of <varname>struct resource</varname>
+	containing addresses and sizes of your memory mappings. This
+	information is passed to the driver using the
+	<varname>.resource</varname> and <varname>.num_resources</varname>
+	elements of <varname>struct platform_device</varname>.
+	</para>
+	<para>
+	You now have to set the <varname>.name</varname> element of
+	<varname>struct platform_device</varname> to
+	<varname>"uio_pdrv"</varname> to use the generic UIO platform device
+	driver. This driver will fill the <varname>mem[]</varname> array
+	according to the resources given, and register the device.
+	</para>
+	<para>
+	The advantage of this approach is that you only have to edit a file
+	you need to edit anyway. You do not have to create an extra driver.

+<title>Using uio_pdrv_genirq for platform devices</title>
+	<para>
+	Especially in embedded devices, you frequently find chips where the
+	irq pin is tied to its own dedicated interrupt line. In such cases,
+	where you can be really sure the interrupt is not shared, we can take
+	the concept of <varname>uio_pdrv</varname> one step further and use a
+	generic interrupt handler. That's what
+	<varname>uio_pdrv_genirq</varname> does.
+	</para>
+	<para>
+	The setup for this driver is the same as described above for
+	<varname>uio_pdrv</varname>, except that you do not implement an
+	interrupt handler. The <varname>.handler</varname> element of
+	<varname>struct uio_info</varname> must remain
+	<varname>NULL</varname>. The  <varname>.irq_flags</varname> element
+	must not contain <varname>IRQF_SHARED</varname>.
+	</para>
+	<para>
+	You will set the <varname>.name</varname> element of
+	<varname>struct platform_device</varname> to
+	<varname>"uio_pdrv_genirq"</varname> to use this driver.
+	</para>
+	<para>
+	The generic interrupt handler of <varname>uio_pdrv_genirq</varname>
+	will simply disable the interrupt line using
+	<function>disable_irq_nosync()</function>. After doing its work,
+	userspace can reenable the interrupt by writing 0x00000001 to the UIO
+	device file. The driver already implements an
+	<function>irq_control()</function> to make this possible, you must not
+	implement your own.
+	</para>
+	<para>
+	Using <varname>uio_pdrv_genirq</varname> not only saves a few lines of
+	interrupt handler code. You also do not need to know anything about
+	the chip's internal registers to create the kernel part of the driver.
+	All you need to know is the irq number of the pin the chip is
+	connected to.
