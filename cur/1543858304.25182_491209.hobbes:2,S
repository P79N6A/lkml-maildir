just for the public record (i already communicated with Jan in private 
mail on this one)... i have a box which hangs hard starting at 2.6.18.2 
and 2.6.19 -- hangs hard during the intel hw rng tests (no sysrq 
response).  and the hang occurs prior to the printk so it took some 
digging to figure out which module was taking out the system.
Jan's patch gets the box past the hang... it seems like this should be in 
at least the next 2.6.19.x stable (and if there's going to be another 
2.6.18.x stable then it should be included there as well).
there is apparently no hw rng on this box (returns all 0xff).
thanks
