Yep, I thought that too. Still, this way of checking the patch level using the
relative file pathname in the kernel tree seemed pretty straightforward so i
sent it. Off the top of my head, we could check for "/dev/null" on the "---"
line and skip that hunk... like so:

Check the patch level of the diff hunks in a patch text file. It works
only when checkpatch.pl is called from within the kernel tree. The only
case it misses is when the patch creates a new file and the patchlevel is wrong.
However, this cannot be checked for reliably using this approach of stat()ing
the relative url of the patched file.
