I've not seen the numbers indeed, I've been told of a problem with a "customer 
program" and Ingo connected my work with this problem. Frankly, I've been 
always astonished about how looking up a 10-level tree can be slow. Poor 
cache locality is the only thing that I could think about.
That said, it was an add-on, not the original motivation of the work.
