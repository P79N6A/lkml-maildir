If that's the problem, then there IS a fix for it - most modems have
an S-register where the character used for switching to command mode
is set, and if you tweak that to some other character, preferably one
that's rarely repeated, it will help.
There's also an S-register that sets the delay required either side of
that sequence for it to be recognised, and if you also set that rather
higher than the default 60 seconds, that helps even more...

I'd also check for susceptibility for the above as well...

At last !!!
