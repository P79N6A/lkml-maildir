I'm not trying to suggest we "fake" anything. Your just misunderstanding
me.. I'm am suggesting we change LOC to something readable. If you think
we're "faking" something by dropping the current "timer" request_irq()
then we certainly don't need to do that ..
The io-apic timer could potentially be a clock event device, that is
it's function isn't it ? It generates interrupts (note I said
interrupts) periodically .. The NMI is another example of that,
generates non-maskable interrupts based off a clock.. All are clock
based interrupt generating devices .. All could be clock event sources,
with all the other clock event sources in the system.
It makes sense (to me at least) that we should list all those interrupt
generating devices in /proc/interrupts with statistics of their usage.. 
I'm making suggestion here, you can call it "fake"'ing something or
whatever, but I'm still going to pose suggestions.

Empirically, I know that users do not/will not understand what's
happened. so take that how ever you want, but _I_ think we should do
something so people better understand what has happened.
