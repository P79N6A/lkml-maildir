Nearly all Dell laptops do this, it's the power supply making that noise. 
The supply won't fail, but it's bad for the batteries.  The solution in 2.4 
was to turn off 'APM calls when CPU idle'.  I suspect unloading thermal.o 
has the same effect.
As for X, do you have the Synaptics touchpad X driver in Fedora core?  You 
probably need the kernel driver as well, and to check out the documentation 
(sorry, no pointer handy).  It's a bit different, in that the driver 
suppresses taps and clicks that are too close in time (by a configurable 
amount) to typing.  This avoids the common false mouse clicks caused by 
case flexure setting off the touchpad.  It also implements X events for 
corner taps, edge scroll regions, and pressure sense.  All in all, much 
better once understood, but it is different.
