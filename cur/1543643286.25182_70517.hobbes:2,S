   It is not trivial however, 2 new fields to the sk_buff need to be 
   added, a small change in the IP fragment code and a small change in 
   ip_tables.c, a change to netfilter.h and netfilter.c.
I've seen these changes, they are very buggy.  The IPv4 copies added
are just ugly and are buggy too, they potentially copy past the end
of the packet buffer.
   So, if you would accept br-nf, that would be great.
You need to remove the IPv4 bits, that copy of the MAC has to happen
at a different layer, it does not belong in IPv4.  At best, everyone
shouldn't eat that header copy.
Franks a lot,
