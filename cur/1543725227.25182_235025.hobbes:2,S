This is also what I see (on my Asus P4P800) more or less:
ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:00:1d.7[D] -> GSI 23 (level, low) -> IRQ 23
ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: Intel Corp. 82801EB/ER (ICH5/ICH5R) USB2 EHCI Controller
ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: BIOS handoff failed (104, 1010001)
ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: can't reset
ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: init 0000:00:1d.7 fail, -95
ehci_hcd: probe of 0000:00:1d.7 failed with error -95
The funny thing is, it has happened with various kernel snapshots
(right term for the 2.6.7-bk??-patches?) but not all.
I thought I had one (2.6.7-bk17) which didn't give this response,
but now it does, and I suspect the problem is really something else.
(Some automatic irq assignment to usb-hardware?)
I'm not into kernel source hacking so I can't really say much more.

Then it's in mine also.
J.O.
PS. uname -a gives this:
Linux bombadil 2.6.8-rc2 #1 SMP Sun Jul 18 09:08:22 CEST 2004 i686 unknown
and I compiled the kernel with gcc 3.4.0.
