Subject: effect of nfs blocksize on I/O ?

I am not talking about rsize/wsize, rather the fs blocksize.
2.4 sets this to MIN(MAX(MAX(4096,rsize),wsize),32768) = 8192 typically.
2.6 sets this to nfs_fsinfo.wtmult?nfs_fsinfo.wtmult:512 = 512 typically.
(My estimation of "typical" may be way off though.)
At a 512 byte blocksize, this overflows struct statfs for fs > 1TB.
Most of my NFS filesystems (on netapp) are larger than that.
But more importantly, what does the VFS *do* with the blocksize?
strace seems to show that glibc/stdio does consider it.  If I fprintf()
two 4096 byte strings, libc does a single write() with 8192 blocksize,
and 3 write()'s for 512 blocksize.  I haven't looked to see what goes
over the wire, but I assume that still follows rsize/wsize.
Does any NFS server report wtmult?
Here's a patch.
