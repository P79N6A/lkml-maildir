I use the -B flag to insure the archives are just under 2GB.  This
generates multiple volumes by appending a sequence number if necessary.
For example, on a /home dump of >2GB, the commands
ddate=`date +%m%d%y-%H%M%S`
dump -0uM -b 32 -B 2097142 -f /mnt/home.$ddate.L0.dump -L "abit:/home"
/home
generate
/mnt/home.092801-130439.L0.dump001
/mnt/home.092801-130439.L0.dump002
each guaranteed to be 10K under 2GB.  Fixes potential portability issues
also.
rgds,
tim.
