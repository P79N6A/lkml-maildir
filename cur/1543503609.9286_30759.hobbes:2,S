Subject: How to set up handler for 'lcall 0x27,0'

I'm trying to get Solaris/Intel binary emulation working on Linux. The syscall 
trap used on Solaris appears to be 'lcall 0x27,0'.
I noticed the lcall7 handler, and was hoping that I'd be able to just copy it 
and change the 7 to 0x27. No such luck.
Nothing in the lcall7 setup or handler, or in the [gl]dt setup that I can find,
appears to make a direct reference to segment 0x07, or indeed to contain the 
number seven at all. 
Other than 'RTFM', where TFM in question is the entirety of the 386+ 
architecture manuals, can anyone furnish me with a clue?
