About 2 months ago, I moved all of my servers ( 15 of them) to the 2.2.x 
kernels.  Some were clean installs of RH 6.0, some were upgrades to RH 
5.2.  But all of these servers ran 2.0.35 and 2.0.36 with 100+ days of 
uptime and were rock solid.  But since moving to the 2.2 kernels on the 
same hardware, reliability and uptime sucks.  Seems like I can rarely get a 
month of uptime with the 2.2 kernels, and I've tried everything from 2.2.5 
to 2.2.14pre13.  The few oopses I've had have been traced back to buggy 
hardware that has since been replaced.  But in most every case with the 2.2 
kernels, the servers (mainly serving web pages)  run for a few days to a 
week and then lock up completely.  Then it requires a power cycle to bring 
it back to life.
So I'm stumped.  When a system locks up I don't get any console messages or 
anything in syslog.  Since all of these servers ran 2.0.x kernels and were 
very stable for months, I'm inclined to think the hardware is fine.  So any 
clues as to how I might track this down?  I'd hate to say it (flame jacket 
on) but my NT and freeBSD boxes are putting Linux to shame in terms of 
stability....
