Nice. But some issues with the implementation
+#if defined(CONFIG_X86_64)
+#define is_current_32bits() (current_thread_info()->flags & _TIF_IA32)
This should be is_compat_task(). And we don't do such ifdefs
in generic code.  And what you actually need here is a 
is_compat_task_with_funny_u64_alignment() (better name sought)
So I would suggest you add macros for that to the ia64 and x86-64
asm/compat.hs and perhaps a ARCH_HAS_FUNNY_U64_ALIGNMENT #define in there.
+	ret = 0;
+	switch (convert) {
+		case COMPAT_TO_USER:
+			pt = (struct ipt_entry_target *)target;
etc. that looks ugly. why can't you just define different functions
for that?  We don't really need in kernel ioctl
+#ifdef CONFIG_COMPAT
+	down(&compat_ipt_mutex);
+#endif
Why does it need an own lock?
Overall the implementation looks very complicated. Are you sure
it wasn't possible to do this simpler?
