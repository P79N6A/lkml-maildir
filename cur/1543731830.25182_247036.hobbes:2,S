Reiser4 currently links /metas/ directory under each reiser4 fs object. 
Reiser4 "silently" allows regular file to be a directory for that.
That is only an example how an fs object may link its internal hierarchical
structure to the fs tree.  /dev/hda/-as-a-dir is another example, but, I am
afraid, it is not a reiser4 business to look into the devices.  Devfs or its
successor may do it.
