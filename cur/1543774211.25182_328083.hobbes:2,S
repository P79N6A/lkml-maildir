Don't know what to do about epxa10db.  I never merged the corresponding
drivers/pld subdirectory, which I suspect uses this stuff.  No one
complained about that either.
If this file goes, I'll have to remove drivers/pld from my tree, in
which case that code gets irretrievably lost.  Alternatively I could
submit it, but I've no idea what state it's in now.
