I hate "me toos" but maybe this will provide some useful data.
I'm seeing the same thing with a 3c59x driver.  I couldn't reproduce the
problem with a tulip driver when I connect my laptop directly to my
cable modem.  The problem only occurs when going through the laptop
(which acts as a firewall, running netfilter) to a remote site, in my
case the site is sources.redhat.com.
