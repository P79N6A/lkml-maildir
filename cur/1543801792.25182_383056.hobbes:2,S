No problem for me in going to a single spinlock.
I did the hashed spinlock patch in order to reduce the size of the route hash 
table and not hurting big NUMA machines. If you think a single spinlock is OK, 
that's even better !

Just one point : This should be cache_line aligned, and use one full cache 
line to avoid false sharing at least. (If a cpu takes the lock, no need to 
invalidate *rt_hash_table for all other cpus)
