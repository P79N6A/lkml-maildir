Sorry about this.
Firstly, it's my "bug" and secondly my posts earlier today
to this subject explaining that, didn't get through.
In 2.2.2-ac6+7 and 2.2.3-ac1,2,3 there is a new sg driver
that has command queuing amongst other things. This means
that an app can write off multiple packets before doing the
corresponding reads. Monty's code in cdparanoia alpha 9.4
detects this via the select() [poll()] system call and
reports:
"SCSI transport: writeable when reading packet"
When this error was reported, I turned command queuing off
by default and Alan brought this out in 2.2.3-ac2+3 .
There is no intrinsic problem with poll() in the 2.2.x
kernels that I am aware off.
My apologies to Monty for not informing him earlier about
this (and causing him some sleepless nights).
