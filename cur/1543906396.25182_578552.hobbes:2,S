I guess I was asking - _if_ this is really important - lets pick a 
preferred way, and try to use the existing infrastructure (sparce 
or checkpatch.pl) to try to enforce it.
If it is just pedantic - let it go. There are lots of ways to do the 
same thing, one is not necessarily more correct. (but in this case - 
I see the point, and agree).

Then let's ask people to use sparse on anything in their diffstat.
(or at least recommend it).
Sparse isn't mentioned in Documentation/SubmittingPatches yet. (if
it is a suggestion)
Even something completely stupid like:
diff -uprN old new | diffstat -p 0 | grep -v changed | awk '{print $1}' | sed 's/\.c/\.o/' | xargs make C=2
worked for me.
