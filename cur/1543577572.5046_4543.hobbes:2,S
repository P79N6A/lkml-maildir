The netfilter configuration allowed you to illegally specify
FTP support as non-modular, yet NAT support modular.  That
cannot work.  I would suggest changing NAT support to be
non-modular if you want FTP support non-modular.
Rusty, I think this is another case where the netfilter config
should be more stringent and disallow illegal combinations such
as this one.
