This is the core dispute here. Stated differently, I hope you never
design a bridge that I have to drive over.
Correctness first, optimization second. Introducing random and
difficult to trace crashes upon an unsuspecting audience of sysadmins
and users is not a viable option.
If at some point one of the pro-4k stacks crowd can prove that all
code paths are safe, or introduce another viable alternative (such as
Matt's idea for extending the stack dynamically), then removing the 8k
stacks option makes sense.
