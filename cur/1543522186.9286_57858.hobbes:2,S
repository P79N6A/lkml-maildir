Anyone using ORBS to filter any kind of important mail is probably nuts.
The funny thing is that their approach does not work. All people have to
do is set their MTA to relay for ORBS and their database is junk. They
start listing all kinds of servers as open relays when they, in fact, are
not. Other lists contain mail servers that have actualy been used to send
spam and are more useful.
What ORBS has is a database of mail servers that will relay for ORBS and
servers that will not allow them to connect. Sounds relatively useless to
me.
I simply disagree with the approach. I might have a bit less contempt for
them if they did not list open relays for spammers. In practice they are a
search engine for spammers.
