Actually, I guess I wouldn't have to change the format. I could just 
extend the existing "tree" object to be able to point to other trees, and 
that's it.
The downside of that is that then a tree wouldn't have a canonical format 
any more: you could have two trees that have the exact same content, but 
they'd haev different names. They should obviously merge very easily (and 
thus you could create a new merge that _does_ have a common name), but 
it's ugly.
I'll have to think about it. It's good to notice these issues early, this 
was the first time I had actually tried to check in a kernel-sized tree 
for real.
