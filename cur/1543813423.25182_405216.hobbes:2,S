I see. I think you are right.
In addition to the fact that there is one bit for IO enable and one
bit for MMIO enable, I think we should not enable I/O port (or MMIO)
of the device if not all the I/O port (or MMIO) regions are assigned
to the device because we must build a consistent address mapping
before enabling it.
It seems that using pci_enable_device_bars() is not a good idea.
If there is no objection, I'll design and implement take6 again.
Any comments?
