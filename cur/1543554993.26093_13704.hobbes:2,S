NetWare was delineated into five levels of bugs to determine commercial 
ship worthiness.  NT is somewhat sloppier than what Novell does because
they are not running a ring 0 OS.  Kernel development is Ring 0 
development, so a lot of the same concepts apply:
Level I - Abends and Severe Kernel or Memory Corruption bugs, or 
functionality bugs. (Oops level stuff, or Deadlock types of
bugs).
Level II - Critical Bugs in peripheral subsystems, like broken
drivers that would abend (Oops), but that would not halt shipment
of core components.
Level III - boundry condition bugs, like app or subsystem problems
in low memory, intermittent LAN or obscure hardware related bugs.
Level IV - Missing Functionality, like the speaker volume not working
with pcmcia-cs-3.1.22 on an IBM thinkpad -- non-critical, but annoying.
Level V - Feature/Documentation out of sync, docs need updating, etc.
Where I came from, when you ht 0 Level I bugs, time to ship.  When Linus 
can post a 2.4 status that has no new Level I issues, I will put my 
	2.4 RPM out.  To date, i just keeps dragging on, with a whole
new slew of new Level I bugs every week, but it is having fewer and
fewer of them.  
He obviously posts these updates for public comment.  We ship Linux,
so there's our 2 cents.
