Subject: 2.4.4 and VC display lost

I have mentioned this weird behaviour under 2.4.3 as well.
if I use X for some time, I alwasy switch and forth between the (IMHO)
idel CLI and sometimes switch back to the clumsy GUI.
now, what happens is that sometimes, after I switch from X back to a VC,
the display gets black and stays that way.
the system works fine. I can still input everything I like etc but won't
see anything.
it's on all non graphic consoles and I can't recover without rebooting.
anyone an idea ? 
I am using X 4.02 (XFREE) on a riva TNT (viper 550); no special driver
used, only the one that's supplied with X itself.
