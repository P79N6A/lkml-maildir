actually I just had to workaround that code for kgdb, and yes, vsyscalls
would run above PAGE_OFFSET too. OTOH now I don't see anymore the point
of the patch that I posted that is included in 2.4.20rc1, I wrongly
assumed that setting the TF would not guarantee DR_STEP to be set in
db6 (there would be no other reason for such patch) but according to the
manual this isn't the case, so 2.5 is correct and 2.4.20rc1 is overkill
and so I'll backout that patch too, that will avoid the ugly workaround
with kgdb too (that basically disabled such check on the eip as soon as
kgdb was started). If anybody can see a problem in backing out from 2.4
the patch I was suggesting for 2.5 please let me know. Thanks.
