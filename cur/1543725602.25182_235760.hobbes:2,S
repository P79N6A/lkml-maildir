I don't have 2.6.7-vanilla at hand, but if 2.6.7-mm6 counts then yes,
swsusp1 also triggers that. Note that it doesn't seem to occur when DRI is
not actively used -- the radeon driver code takes quite a long time (up to
4 secs.) to switch to a text VT depending on circumstances, namely when KDE
is up. A plain windowmaker dekstop takes much shorter to switch.
As I'm leaving tomorrow, I won't have time to test with vesafb / fbdev
until next week.
Best regards,
