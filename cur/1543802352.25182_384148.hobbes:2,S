I have attached a file which I use as thread API. Complete code is
quiet large and also need proper description. which i would be posting
if needed.
I hope I make my problem clear: I repeat : same code is giving alot of
performance degradation on previously mentioned configuration. One
suspect is the thread library.
dts_thread_t *dts_register_thread(void (*run) (void *),  const char
*name, void * private)
is the function to register my thread handler
void dts_wakeup_thread(dts_thread_t *thread)
is the function in the dts_thread.c which i use to run my thread.
all my thread handlers either
call generic_make_request some times for my RAMDISK and sometimes for
my Target device [SCSI DISK or local HDD partition]
OR
uses list.h
