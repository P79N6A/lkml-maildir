I have had three boards with nforce2 replaced (all of them Soltek SL75FRN2-L)
and all three did the same. However it seemed the frequency of the crashes
varies with actual piece of board.
The crashes aren't in software - bare 'cat /dev/hda > /dev/null' is
often to lock up the machine to the point that poweroff fails.
