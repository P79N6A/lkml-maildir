Hi. My console's on a serial line. Modular serial support doesn't work 
so well for me. And if I start net-booting or putting my root
filesystem on NFS, then modular-only network drivers are probably
going to make me sad.
Remember, one man's bloat is another man's necessary feature. Not
everyone runs linux on a standalone home machine with a monitor and
keyboard; some of us have racks full of headless machines, and some
have even stranger setups.
Also, when you start splitting up sources like that, you're bound to
have annoying "which kernels will work with this module package"
problems. We already have enough consistency problems; let's not make
it worse.
