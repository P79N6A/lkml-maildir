What Jamie is referring to is:
	spin_lock_irqsave(a);	/* No-op - no counter increment */
	spin_lock(b);		/* count = 1 */
	wakeup_other_task()
		spin_lock_irqsave(runqueue_list);	/* no-op */
		.. wakeup, current->need_resched = 1;
		spin_unlock_irqsave(runqueue_list);	/* no-op */
	spin_unlock(b);		/* Decrement, count = 0;  !!!! BOOM !!!!! */
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(b);
so IF you check for "needs_resched" after a spin_unlock(), then you can't
do the simple and efficient optimization I was talking about, because the
counters are not really precise - they rely on interrupts not happening.
Problems like this is why I'm a big believer in NOT overdesigning things.
Keep it simple and STUPID, and you'll live a healthy long life. And let's
not mess with SMP.
