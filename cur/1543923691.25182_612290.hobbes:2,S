Strange. I rebuilt the kernel, compiled the usb serial and options into
the kernel, while leaving usb-storage as module. Still I have to issue
the huaweiAktBbo program to get it working/switching into the *right*
modus.

BTW, I have seen a slightly different pattern: Green blinking from the
beginning
calling huaweiAktBbo to make the switch
still blinking green
calling the internet provider
when the connection is established (on the hardware level, not on ip
level) the modem starts blinking blue and then solid blue
turning off the ppp connection it goes into blinking blue mode

Probably you could use the huaweiAktBbo program for this, too.
Best wishes
Norbert
