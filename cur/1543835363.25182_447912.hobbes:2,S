The driver may not know when the next update will happen, e.g., if its
data source is event-based. Moreover, the driver may be able to
*decide* when the next update will happen (i.e., when to query
poll-based hardware) if the clients say what they need in advance. The
"lazy poll" / "reverse select" handles both of these.
