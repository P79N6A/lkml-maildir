I have written a GPIO device class driver for the same purpose; before
this goes into the kernel I think we should try to merge your attempts
with mine.
On embedded systems you normally have several things which are similar
to LEDs; embedded processors have quite a lot of general purpose I/O
pins. Normally you want some of the pins being used from userspace (like
'echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio5/level'), others are used from device
drivers. My framework offers a request_gpio() function similar to
request_gpio(), so the kernel can administrate these ressources. 
I suppose it is not too difficult to unify our drivers in a way that the
base mechanism is more abstract then LEDs (a GPIO pin can also represent
a power switch or whatever) and still can support your LED levels. 
I'll pull the gpio patch out of my working tree and post it here for
discussion.
