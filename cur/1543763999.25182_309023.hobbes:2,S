These are just representations of the same thing.  However, I did
deliberately elect not to try to solve this problem in the accessors.  I
know all about the register relayout, because 53c700 has to do that on
parisc.
However, I don't think it's the job of the io accessors to remap the
register locations (primarily because the remapping depends on the
documentation:  a chip that's documented as BE on BE has no remapping
required.  Hoever, the same chip on LE would need this).

We have this in parisc too ...
