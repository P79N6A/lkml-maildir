  Those two things are rather unrelated -- caching mechanism, based on
"better khttpd" can use the same thing inside the kernel if it will be
implemented in a generic way.
  And IMHO the problem with the number of threads/processed necessary for
the implementation (that still can be managed efficiently) seems to be
so significant now because existing HTTP servers in all their forms
have large memory footprint thus causing unnecessary paging when the
number of requests increases.
