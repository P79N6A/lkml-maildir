I prefer the option to specify the base baud rate in setserial from a 
startup script.  Having the additional ports at BAUD 0 (unusable) until 
some explicit action is taken strikes me as a safer option, provided 
this gets properly documented in the kernel Documentation directory and 
in Linux HOWTO docs.
