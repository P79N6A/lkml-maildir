One discussion of the issue as it affects a Linux component is:
http://www.freeswan.org/freeswan_trees/freeswan-1.5/doc/exportlaws.html
This is not entirely up to date and the author (me) is neither a lawyer nor
unbiased. It has lots of links, though, including links to stuff by
lawyers and people with very different biases.

My understanding is that all that is controlled. A "crypto-shaped hole" for
plugins is subject to the same export restrictions as the crypto code itself...

The problem is that tools that should be in every Linux distribution
currently aren't.
Last I looked, you needed to go to kerneli.org for international patches
if you wanted an encrypting file system. The kernel parts of FreeS/WAN
IPSEC are also patches. These could not be in the standard Linux kernel
because that is distributed from the US.
Neither those patches nor user-level crypto tools like SHH, PGP, the
SHTTP support for Apache, ... can be shipped with US-based Linux
distributions such as Redhat, unless Redhat either produce a crippled
export version or get an export license.
e.g I know of three distributions that ship with FreeS/WAN: Corel from
Canada, Conectiva from Brazil, and SuSE from Germany.
There are two related goals here. Get the kernel parts of these tools
into the standard Linux kernel and get the rest into US-based Linux
distributions.

For details see

I'll try a summary. The EFF and Berstein argued that crypto export
restrictions, applied to source code, violate the constitutional protection
on freedom of speech. Two courts so far have agreed, the one first hearing
the case and the Ninth Circuit court on appeal.
Having lost twice, the gov't. changed the laws (or just the regulations?) 
and asked to have the case re-heard.

So the open questions are to what extent these changes allow us to
include crypto in kernel tarballs and US-based Linux distributions.
As I recall, someone from kernel.org said a few months back that
their lawyers were looking at this. Anyone know the results?
