Could you merge my trivial patches?
i386-allow-disabling-x86_feature_sep-at-boot.patch
        I keep having to backport this one because I need it for testing mainline.
i386-__devinit-should-be-__cpuinit.patch
        Saves a few K when HOTPLUG && !HOTPLUG_CPU
i386-fall-back-to-sensible-cpu-model-name.patch
        Rohit signed off on this one.
kbuild-add-fverbose-asm-to-i386-makefile.patch
        Nice to have and does this for all archs, not just i386.
