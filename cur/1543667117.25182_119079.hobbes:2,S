Subject: [2.5.64] X unlock doesn't work

Now there's a new one... I just noticed that in my 2.5.64 kernel, when my 
screensaver comes up and asks for a password to unlock, no matter what 
password I give it is rejected. With 2.5.59 passwords work for the user 
logged in.
Redhat 7.3, GNOME.
I just noticed because this is the first time since 2.5.64 came out that I 
did anything from console, since it's a mail machine, stats collector, 
etc.
I'll try 2.5.65 next week when I have more time.
