oops sorry. after asking again only the daemon process is killed.
and in this operators view it's a client issue if his daemon dies,
so he is not willing to ask ibm what might be wrong.
with 2.2.0-pre4/6 the adsm process on aix does crash, with 2.1.131 
it does work, and i got an untested report that with 2.2.0-pre5 it 
also works.
sorry.
andreas
