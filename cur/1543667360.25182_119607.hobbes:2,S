There's some recent benchmark data from hrandoz showing shpte is
actually doing very well on the speed front lately.
As far as constituency goes I mostly see unintelligent forking servers
(unfortunately these are all too common and tend not to cooperate by
using hugetlb etc.) and smaller machines wanting various trimmings from
kernel memory consumption benefitting. I personally see 2-3MB of
pagetable memory savings from it with end-user workstation loads (X,
xterms, xmms, web browsers, very little dynamic fork()/exec()'ing etc.),
which IMHO is a substantial reduction of the runtime footprint of the
kernel. It alone also conserves 5-6MB of pte_chains in addition to ptes
w/o objrmap. I've also overheard strong interest from software vendors.
