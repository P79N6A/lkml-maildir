I based what I did on how printk works:
        va_start(args, fmt);
        r = vprintk(fmt, args);
        va_end(args);
It doesn't call va_* anywhere else.  I don't claim to be a varargs expert,
but if I'm wrong, I'm at least wrong the same way that printk is, so not
in any way that's significant for any other architecture Linux runs on.
