It would be most unfortunate if the existance of netdump is used as a
reason to deny LKCD's inclusion, or to simply dismiss LKCD as stupid.

While Red Hat advocates Ingo's netdump option, we have customer
requests that are requiring us to look at LKCD disk-based dumps as an
alternative, co-existing dump mechanism.  Since the two methods are not mutually
exclusive, LKCD will never kill off netdump -- nor certainly vice-versa.  We're
all just looking for a better means to be able to
provide support to our customers, not to mention its value as a
development aid.
