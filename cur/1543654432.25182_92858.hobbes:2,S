Also I can't see how the new module infrastructure could have made it
in w/o having been complete, *functional*, proven and thoroughly reviewed
off-tree in the first place (which I thought was pretty much a standard
around here).  Mature, drop-in replacement projects like Keith Owen's
kbuild 2.5 are getting ignored while something as wild as Rusty's "welcome
in module hell exhibit" is merged right when the tree is supposed to start
stabilizing.
And heck, I haven't even seen Viro and Hellwig complaining!
What's going on?  :)
