I'm not the person to whom you asked the question, but I will answer
anyway.
I have never used a -mm kernel tree before, but seeing that fuse got
included made me download the patch to try it.
I'll be using gmailfs (which needs fuse) just to see how things work with
Debian's testing (sarge) userland.
Hope this is another data point of interest, Rogério.
