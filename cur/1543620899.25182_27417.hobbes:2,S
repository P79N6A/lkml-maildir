Wow, this must be a crazy machine. This means it's using Set1 by default
on the keyboard and has translation switched off in the i8042. Hmm, I'll
have to add a way to detect this ... can you try the attached patch to
see if it fixes your problem? With this patch, you shouldn't need to add
"i8042_direct=1" as it should detect the case automatically. If it
doesn't, please send me the log with this change and without the option
again.
