As suggested I just stopped vmware and removed the modules from memory.
lsmod did not show any VM modules anymore.
then did a sync and AGAIN!!!
#ps -lwa | grep sync
     0     0  1051   994   1   0   1020   324 wait_on_dqu D   ?   0:00 sync 
or 
#ps -lwan | grep sync
     0     0  1051   994   0   0   1020   324  c0133151   D  8800  0:00 sync 
I've attached both full ps.
maybe this could be of any clue to someone?
Thanks
Andre
