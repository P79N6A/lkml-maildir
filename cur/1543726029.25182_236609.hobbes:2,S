I like that idea!  Stick a nodemask_t in struct pci_bus, initialize it
to NODE_MASK_ALL.  If a particular arch wants to put something more
accurate in there, then great, if not, we're just in the same boat we're
in now.
Anyone else have opinions one way or the other on Jesse's idea?

I'm trying to keep the dependency of topology on what the pci_dev and
pci_bus structs look like to a minimum.  That's why I'd like to keep the
topology function based on PCI bus numbers (or possibly struct pci_bus),
not struct pci_dev.  The pci_bus is what really has the node affinity
anyway, and the device only has that affinity through the fact that it
is physically plugged into a particular bus.
