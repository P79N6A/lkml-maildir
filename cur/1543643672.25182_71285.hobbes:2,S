Hrm, I cannot reproduce this.  I just successfully completed a `dbench
16'.  Can you find where they are hanging?  You can get a trace via
sysrq.  You can also see where they are in the kernel via the wchan
field of ps: "ps -ewo user,pid,priority,%cpu,stat,command,wchan" is a
favorite of mine.
Sure it does not happen with a stock kernel (no preempt)?
What if you replace the printk() and dump_stack() in schedule() with a
no-op (but not something that will optimize away the conditional, i.e.
try a cpu_relax()).
Oh, is the previous patch fully backed out?  None of that do_exit muck
anymore, right?

I too am SMP with kernel preemption, dual Athlon MP.
