With KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG you can avoid the editing of the .config and set 
32/64-bit on the make command line - and it's not limited to the 
32/64-bit choice:
$ cat /home/jeff/myi386config
CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G=y
CONFIG_X86_32=y 
CONFIG_SMP=n
CONFIG_PCI=n
CONFIG_IPV6=m
$ make allyesconfig KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG=/home/jeff/myi386config
