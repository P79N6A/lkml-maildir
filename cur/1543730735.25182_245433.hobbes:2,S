You can add more functionality to filesystem and use xattrs to control it.
For example:
- acls
- compress file
- encrypt file (copy user's password into task_struct and use it to
encrypt his files)
- preallocate file in 4MB contignuous chunks, becuase it needs real time
multimedia access
- sync/append-only/immutable
etc.
However there's no need why an application should care whether the file is
compressed, whether it has acls, or so. And applications don't.
And I think this is the only legitimate use for xattrs. Who else uses them
except samba? I don't see how reiser4's hybrids would help.
