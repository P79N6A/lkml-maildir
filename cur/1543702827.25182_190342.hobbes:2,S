Disregarding the debates of true vs. pseudo randomness, ( an argument 
best left to cypherpunks, philosophers, and quantum physicists ) -- let 
me repeat the question the original poster asked ...
Does anyone have any info about securikey?  The "white papers" on their 
website are nothing but fluff.
It smells like snake oil to me --  probably just a thumbdrive with an 
authentication driver.
Unless it actually encrypts the hard disk, it can't provide much security.
The system can most likely still be booted from a floppy or cdrom.
