I don't know why this would be a useful feature (of course I'm talking
about processes at the same nice level). One of the big problems with
the current scheduler is that it is unfair in some corner cases. It
works OK for most people, but when it breaks down it really hurts. At
least if you start with a fair scheduler, you can alter priorities
until it satisfies your need... with an unfair one your guess is as
good as mine.
So on what basis would you allow unfairness? On the basis that it doesn't
seem to harm anyone? It doesn't seem to harm testers?
I think we should aim for something better.

Yes, bounded and proportional to.

And I think that's what its main problems are. It's interactivity
obviously can't be too bad for most people. It's performance seems to
be pretty good.
