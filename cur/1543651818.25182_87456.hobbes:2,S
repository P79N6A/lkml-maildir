Not a kernel bug.  Let's break this down....
(BTW this is why I'm not all that fond of initrd at all.  In fact, I
have a very strong distatse for initrd....)

The kernel mounted the initrd filesystem here, which was ext2 based.

This is where the initrd system mounted the (real) root filesystem as
ext3, and then did the pivotroot to switch the root filesystem from
the initrd ramdisk to the real root filesystem.

init doesn't actually run fsck.ext2.  Instead, init runs /etc/rc, and
that in turn runs fsck, and fsck consults /etc/fstab to determine
which fsck to run.  (So does mount when it creates /etc/mtab file
after the root filesystem is remount read-write.)
The reason why I haven't had fsck consult /proc/mounts is that it
would be a special-case thing that only makes sense for the root
filesystem, since that's the only filesystem which should be mounted
at the time fsck runs.  Since fsck.ext2 and fsck.ext3 are identical,
changing fsck so that it uses /proc/mounts is a rather moot change,
aside from the cosmetic details of what fsck prints out.
