in e820_reserves request_resource for 0xf0000-0xf03ff for reserve and
0xf0400-4G, will return busy with system_rom_resource (0xf0000-0xfffff)
that is put in the resources list by probe_roms,
We need to add back the patch for e820. otherwise all box with old
linuxbios will be broken to get correct in /proc/iomem in x86_64. and
can not use kexec any more.
Comments?
