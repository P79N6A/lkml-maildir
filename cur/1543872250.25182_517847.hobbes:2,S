Dont even try, you *cannot* do that, without breaking the standards, or 
without a performance drop.
The only safe way would be to lock the file during the whole read()/write() 
syscall, and we dont want this (this would be more expensive than current)
Dont forget 'file' may be some sockets/tty/whatever, not a regular file.
Standards are saying :
If an error occurs, file pointer remains unchanged.
You cannot know for sure how many bytes will be written, since write() can 
returns a count that is different than buflen.
So you cannot update fpos before calling vfs_write()
About your L1 'miss', dont forget that multi-threaded apps are going to 
atomic_dec_and_test(&file->f_count) anyway when fput() is done at the end of 
syscall. And you were concerned about multi-threaded apps, didnt you ?
