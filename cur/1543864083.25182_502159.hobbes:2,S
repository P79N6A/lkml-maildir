I haven't seen it being discussed although it's probably doable as an 
addition to the existing mempool mechanism. Anti-fragmentation would mean 
that the non-atomic GFP_KERNEL allocation had a chance of succeeding.

Unless the load was so high that the pool was getting depleted and memory 
under so much pressure that reclaim could not keep up. But yes, it's 
possible that GFP_ATOMIC allocations could be avoided the majority of 
times.

It shouldn't be that complicated.

Can you describe a reliable way of triggering this problem? At best, I 
hear "on our undescribed workload, we sometimes see this problem" but not 
much in the way of details.
