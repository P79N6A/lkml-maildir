Subject: [patch] kernel_stat cleanup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/11/5/219

This is a trivial cleanup removing two old unused macros from
kernel_stat.h that made no sense with the new per-CPU kstat.
Also included a few finicky coding style changes. Please apply.
Thanks
Dipankar
