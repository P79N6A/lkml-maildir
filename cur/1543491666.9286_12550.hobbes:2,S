Hi Jeff,
Searching a response to this result, I'm creating the asm code for the line:
x=(y) ? x=3:x=4;  /* For y = 1 */
The first result is the value 3 is moved to x. In this point the operator 
?: was resolved. Next, the 4 value is moved to x.In this point the operator
= (minor precedence that ?:) was resolved. To produce the asm code I'm using 
the Borland C++.
Regards,
RMJ.
