Three, actually.

My half-finished regression test suite for busybox mount.  I just rewrote the 
busybox "mount" command to fix a half-dozen bugs (the hardest of which was 
making it properly reentrant so "mount -a" behaves properly).  And I 
basically had to derive a spec for mount from first principles (which I've 
halfway written up, should probably finish and post somewhere), and now I'm 
writing The Regression Test Of Doom.
It runs under User Mode Linux, so it has a nice little clean root environment 
to work in and there's no worry about cleanup for when I typo something in 
the script and it crashes halfway through, because when the UML environment 
exits it takes its current mounts with it.  Eventually I'll probably get it 
to run under a normal root environment...
Let's see...  Tarball attached, and I've been running it with:
~/linux-2.6.16-rc5/linux rootfstype=hostfs rw \
init=/home/landley/busybox/busybox/testsuite/mount.testroot \
TESTDIR=/home/landley/busybox/busybox/testsuite COMMAND=./mount quiet
