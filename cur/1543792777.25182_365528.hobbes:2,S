Eh? WEP seems to work here with different key sizes. I think most people 
should be satisfied with finally being able to use their wireless controller 
in ANY form on a Centrino laptop without having to find a driver!

I'm not sure what you mean by "wreaks havoc". There have been bugfixes, but 
they do not affect many general use-cases. Equally the WPA work really IS 
brand new.
The primary "havoc" I had when upgrading to 2.6.14 was finding the older 
firmware and co-installing it.

I really don't think this is your call. The driver maintainer can push 
whatever code he's most happy with for whatever reasons he likes. I'm 
confident that in time appropriate changes from 1.0.8 will make it into 
mainline.
Perhaps the only criticism here that is valid is that Intel haven't released a 
1.0.9 that builds against release quality (2.6.14) kernels _yet_. But at best 
that is a topic for another mailing list, not the LKML.
