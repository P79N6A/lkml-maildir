There is a CML1 language specification, as written down in a file, namely
Documentation/kbuild/config-language.txt in the kernel tree.
There is one tool (mconfig) which has a yacc-parser that implements that
specification completly, and some horrid ugly scripts in the tree that
parse them in a more or less working way.  There also are a number of
other tools I don't know to much about that understand the language as
well.
All of these tools just require the runtime contained in the LSB and no
funky additional script languages.  Also none needs a binary intermediate
representation of the config.

Of course it doesn't work. We've performed a software upgrade.
