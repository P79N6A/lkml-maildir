Fair enough. I should have re-checked recent sources after your mention
rather than going on the old thread I found.

The latest version of man chrt that I can find implies that it handles
SCHED_BATCH but not SCHED_IDLE. To that end, if anyone else is
interested, I have thrown together the above-suggested 'runidle' which
will invoke the passed command using the SCHED_IDLE scheduler; it's
nothing fancy.
I am running foldingathome under it at the moment, and it seems to be
improving the situation somewhat, but I still need/want to test with
Mike's referenced patches.
runidle.c:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sched.h>
#include <linux/sched.h>
extern char **environ;
int
main(int argc, char **argv) {
  if(argc<2) {
    perror("Must specify at least one argument: the path to the program
to " \
      "execute. Additional arguments may be specified which will be
passed " \
      "to the called program.");
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
  }
  sched_setscheduler(0, SCHED_IDLE, NULL);
  if(argc==2) {
    if(execve(argv[1], NULL, environ) == -1) {
      perror("Failed to execve target!");
    }
  } else {
    if(execve(argv[1], argv+1, environ) == -1) {
      perror("Failed to execve target!");
    }
  }
  /* should be unreachable */
  return EXIT_FAILURE;
}
