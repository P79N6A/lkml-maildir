Linus called the 80-column thing a 'Nazi dream' and I'm inclined to
agree with him. It's something to bear in mind, of course, but sometimes
it's best ignored.
And the 'declaring multiple variables together' is something I've
_never_ heard of. Might be applicable if you're actually giving them
initial values, but just declaring them together is fine, surely?
