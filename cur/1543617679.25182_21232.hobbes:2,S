   Following is a patch against 2.4.18-pre3 which fixes a problem where the 
   protection on user stack pages are not marked executable even though 
   the flags indicate the page is executable.  Some more aggressive cache 
   flush optimizations may rely on the execution marking to indicate if a page 
   needs to be flushed as it might be present in an icache which is not 
   coherent with the dcache.
Actually, PAGE_COPY happens to be executable on many platforms.
