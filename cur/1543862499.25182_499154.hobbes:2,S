If the initramfs root filesystem contains /sbin/hotplug, the kernel 
starts calling it very early in the kernel boot process, well before 
/init has been called. In my case this resulted in lots of hotplug 
segfault messages as the kernel boots, followed by a thoroughly unhappy 
hotplug+udev once /init actually gets control.
To solve this, I deleted /sbin/hotplug from the initramfs archive and 
modified /init to reinstate it once it gets control. This works fine, 
but seems inelegant. Is there a better solution? Should sbin/hotplug be 
called at all before the kernel has passed control to /init?
