Hi Dan,
I agree that net_dma needs to be modified
so that it releases dma channels if not used.
However in the mean time, as long as net_dma is not ready to do this,
the problem of "rmmod ioatdma" in the redesigned dmaengine remains...

This is true for channels of the same device/module.
However, if we have two different devices with different capabilities,
should they both be blocked by single client?
For example, what is use of blocking channels of device
with DMA_MEMCPY capabilities only
by a client interested in DMA_XOR or DMA_MEMSET?
Thanks,
