No, you are right, just wanted to make sure that the .owner stuff is
there.
One thing to note, a lot of people forgot to set that field for binary
attribute files, while "normal" attributes get it set "automatically"
due to the macro that was used to create them.  You might consider also
creating a macro for this struture so people can not forget to set the
field.
