I have already fixed this one, and fix has been already picked by Linus 
from my tree, so you can drop this one. (even the bugzilla is closed 
properly).

The kernel version seems to be a little bit bogus here :)

These two are the same bug. I think we really need 45b503548 reverted in 
mainline.

Looks like this is issue with CONFIG_GROUP_SCHED. Waiting for Peter's 
feedback.
BTW it would be nice to receive CC in the bugzilla, when I have Handled-by 
on that bug :) (but hey, I know that it is difficult to track all the 
persons addressess, when they are not using them consistently).

Thanks a lot Rafael for this regression tracking.
BTW I think it might still be useful to CC everyone involved on these 
reports, even though the bugzillas probably have the correct addressess 
already.
Thanks,
