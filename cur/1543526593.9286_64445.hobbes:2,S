I don't quite understand why the 2.0.x eepro100 driver works perfectly (2
years with 0 problems on 2.0.32 then 2.0.38) but in 2.2.x it gives such
headaches...
Is it really just the card and not the driver at all?  I know there are at
least 101 variants of the eepro100 card.  The one in a 2.0.38 box I use is
probably one of the earliest varieties (physically bigger, not the 1" high
PCP type).
Has anyone got more info?
Lawrence
