Alan, that's crap.  The function in question can be trivially turned into
extern inline and removed from export list completely.  _If_ such change
can be made illegal by exporting uninligned version with EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL
- I'm going to fork the tree *now* and start replacing the stuff exported
that way with untainted clean reimplementations.  As much as I despise
binary-only modules, any mechanism that allows games of that kind needs
to be killed.  One shouldn't be able to prohibit equivalent transformations
of core code (and inlining a function _is_ such transformation) by pulling
the licensing crap.
