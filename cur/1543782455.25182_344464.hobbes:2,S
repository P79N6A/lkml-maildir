Yes, those performance factors have to been taken in account. The
bandwith intensive workloads depends on the implementation of the
filesystem. Note that I am not involved in the internal details of
this filesystem, my goal is to integrate it in the Linux kernel.
The usage of cache memory in this distributed schemas is complicated.
Probably it will be necessary to implement protocols to ensure cache
coherency and consistency.
Hum... it seems that we are going away from environment variables :)
