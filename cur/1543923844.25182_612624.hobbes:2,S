I thought it can be managed under static lock.
But if you sure we can leave device lock too, I'm not familiar with all this on such deep level... at least for now;).
I'm not sure what kind of testing do you mean by "ahead of time". I just tried the latest patch and all seems to be good.
BTW, slab corruption issue that I saw on the original driver we started fixing on is not an issue any more.
