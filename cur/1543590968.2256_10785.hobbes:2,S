Good try, except:
If you are compiling a kernel which will never run on a machine with
more than 1 Gigabyte total physical RAM, answer "off" here (default
choice and suitable for most users). This will result in a "3GB/1GB"
split: 3GB are mapped so that each process sees a 3GB virtual memory  
space and the remaining part of the 4GB virtual memory space is used
by the kernel to permanently map as much physical memory as
possible.
If the machine has between 1 and 4 Gigabytes physical RAM, then
answer "4GB" here.
1 GB is not more than 1 GB so "off" is the correct choice, according to the docs.
Oh I get it NOW.  "Off" means the docs are just plain "off".
