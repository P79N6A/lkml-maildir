If we don't use "flip-flopping" means, the common driver and specific
driver concepts also don't need. They are completely same driver for HID
bus, just one without some hooks, another without. The common event
processing is an API from HID core. so, here have not round-trips.
What's the position of hidraw? It only is used when all other driver is
not usable on some report? or, it should be stick every working device.
PS: In last broken "flip-flopping" resolution, the USBHID work also need
some changes ;)
