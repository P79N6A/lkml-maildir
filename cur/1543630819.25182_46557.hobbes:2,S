This is doable (some other OS's do it) but:
1) It requires some changes to the basic read/write call to gather
the statistics.  It also requires stashing the counters somewhere
such as in the task_struct and thus requires modifying it.
2) It doesn't directly tell you about I/O statistics themselves
(which are available under  /proc/stat) because the I/O request
may be gotten from cache, or may never be flushed from cache
to disk depending on subsequent events, so it will always
tend to overestimate the amount of real I/O done on the device.
