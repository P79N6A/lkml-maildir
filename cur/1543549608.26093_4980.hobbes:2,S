Of course.  But when your kernel was compiling, did you notice the
`gcc` options as the files flew by?  `-fomit-frame-pointer` is standard
on i386 and perhaps other arch's.  It means what it says, and AFAIK
the kernel doesn't have frame-pointers available for debugging.
But when you say "process", that sounds like userland.  Then it 
would depend on whether you compiled with `-fomit-frame-pointer`
or not.
