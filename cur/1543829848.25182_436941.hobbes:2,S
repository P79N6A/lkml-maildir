This is the linux *kernel* list, and this isn't a kernel question.
Also, the details differ based on your distribution and what use you
plan to make of the information - "Have I installed the patch to libpng.so?"
is a different question than "What release of PNG do I have installed, and
what features does the API support?"
Please re-ask your question, with more detail regarding what you're trying
to do, in a more appropriate list...
