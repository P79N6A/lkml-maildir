I too see this issue, but it doesn't go away on 2.6.11.12 for me, 
something is eating /dev/ nodes, writing to them, this doesn't 
happen in 2.4, so yet another "don't do that", or user-space, I 
haven't the foggiest.
fdisk sees the drive on 2.6, 2.4 sees it okay on same hardware
usb-storage also stomps /dev/sdX nodes on this and a different box, 
so something odd is happening with removable storage.
