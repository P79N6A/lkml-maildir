we could fix up all aliases of that page as well and degrade them to UC?

i think the problem is the proximity of some ACPI tables to actual 
device mmio areas - they share the same physical page. The ACPI tables 
will be mapped WB, the device mmio areas will be UC most of the time.

how would this solve the problem at hand? I dont think it's possible to 
guarantee that all the BIOS data pages and mmio areas will have 
compatible attributes. BIOS data pages might be in plain RAM that we 
intend to map WB. Or they might be in reserved areas near the mmio 
addresses.
but if we fixed up aliases (only for that single conflicting page), so 
that all mappings are degraded to UC, we'd have uniform behavior all 
across and the least amount of surprise to drivers. Hm?

ok. Resolving that would be nice anyway because the ACPI table might be 
in plain RAM which might be reused by the kernel later on, etc. FYI, 
there's also the patch from Yinghai Lu on lkml, for one such dangling 
reference problem in the SRAT table.

Subject: [PATCH] x86: copy srat table and unmap in acpi_parse_table
[PATCH] x86: copy srat table and unmap in acpi_parse_table
the old acpi_numa_slit_init was saving old address in early stage acpi_slit
and acpi_parse_table can not unmap address that.
the patch copy the slit in the callback,
so we could unmap table in acpi_parse_table instead of outside track it.

    x86: ACPI: fix mapping leaks
    ioremap_early() is stateful, hence we cannot tolerate mapping leaks.
