Not exactly. Whilst it is a case of what you want is not in the cache (or was
discarded when examined), I'm also refusing to add it to the cache for some
reason or other (ENOMEM, no cache, I/O error on cache, insufficient available
space, etc).
If it was not in the cache, but I am going to let you cache it then I'll
return a cookie instead. All reads on that cookie will return ENODATA until at
such time data has been stored in the cache and can then be retrieved.
All attempts to perform accesses using the "negative" cookie will then fail
gracefully. A "negative" cookie will not be instantiated. You have to get a
new cookie.

But UNIX normally allows you to subsequently go and fill a hole (subject to
space constraints, etc)...

It isn't a "don't know" exactly. It's a "no".

Hmmm... Which is possibly less efficient because CPUs generally are better at
determining 0 than -1.

I don't think I have a need for both. Either I give you a cookie (for which
there may be nothing in the cache); or I give you the "negative" cookie for
which there's definitely nothing in the cache, and gracefully refuse to
service it.
So, would you still rather I used NULL? If so, I can change it easily enough.
