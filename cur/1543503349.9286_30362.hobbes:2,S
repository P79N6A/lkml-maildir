That was in linux-2.2.8, and yes, someone reported to
me that he had strange effects with his Banshee with NOLOCK on, 
which was solved by turning it off. Some other BM cards may have
suffered from that, too.
That's why it was replaced with something else in 2.2.10 and if
you look at 
http://wauug.erols.com/~balsa/linux/cyrix/index.html
and search for the November '97 news, you can find
exactly this fix which does not turn on NOLOCK. Instead,
(as the writer of that page, Andrew D. Balsa writes)
it serializes the execution of the xchg instruction
and it is the official(?) fix from Cyrix.
This fix was tested by me and by the above mentioned
Banshee owner and
1. it did not cause strange effects with his Banshee
2. it made our machines invulnerable against the "coma bug"
Best regards,
Zoltan Boszormenyi
