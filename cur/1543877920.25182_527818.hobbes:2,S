Exactly.
	if (There was a young lady named Bright
		Whose speed was far faster than light) {
		She set out one day
		in a relative way
	}
	And returned on the previous night
obeys the only-ident-by-tabs rule, as does
	if (To control chain reactions, your odds
			Improve if you've got cadmium rods) {
		In your fission reactor
		Their lack is a factor
	}
	In screams of "A meltdown! Ye gods!"
Now, the former makes it hard to tell what's condition vs consequent.
(Or whatever the correct technical term is in cases like these.)
