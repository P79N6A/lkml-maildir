I have seen this reported before, and no solution I can remember. However,
it's not a general problem, something about your setup triggers it. I have
partitions of hundreds of GB on RAID controllers, and 10GB of a few 20GB
ATA/100, with no problems noted.
Perhaps someone can give you a clue on this, but I can tell you that it's
not a general limitation of linux and fdisk.
