How are the dev entires related to CD burning?  If the device entries
don't appear for you that's a problem, but you deserve what you get
for using a POS like udev.  If you have a sd or sr node you can use
SG_IO on it, period.  Whether you can actually burn a CD of course
depends on the capability of the device.  I don't have a CD burner
connected through usb, but I couldn't think of a reason the usb <-> atapi
bridge would make problems with the scsi commands used to burn a CD.
