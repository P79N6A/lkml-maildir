I guess iff people have a clue just what btrfs is and what it is good for
and why one would need it, I guess they also know of Apparmor.
If not, well, I hope you mentioned it in the INSTALL file!
Documentation on the most important things is always a good thing.

Well you could go down the conftest.sh route, but I dislike that
approach because such a Makefile system tries to be smarter than me;
and that often breaks because developers made a mess out of the
remaining Makefile and before long, it broke on odd, but
"standards-conforming", O= builds. (Fun stories with nvidia.)
