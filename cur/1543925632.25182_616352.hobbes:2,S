Well, since the size of the kernel stack is one page, I figured it will 
grow when switching to 64-bit, because some of the types grow and a 
similar flow/stack will be bigger in 64-bit in comparison to 32-bit.
Keeping the page size at 4kb and so keeping the stack at 4kb is a bit 
dangerous. Isn't it?
I know that using one page for a kernel stack is a optional feature, but:
a) It's a good feature
b) It's already used by major distros, e.g. Red Hat
