This could be due to the recent driver update.
I can not reproduce this with a 3c900B-Combo,
so I need some more information to track it down.

Is this for sure that these messages occured first time with git11?
There were no changes in the 3c59x driver between git10 and git11.

If you are willing to provide me with some information
you can send the following:
1. output of lspci -vvv (just the ethernet controller related part)
2. your Kernel configuration
3. modprobe the driver with debug=4 and send
the 3c59x related lines of your logs for both, git11 and git12.
(From driver startup about 15 seconds should be sufficiant for now)
4. the output of "vortex-diag -aem" and "mii-diag".
You can find these tools at
