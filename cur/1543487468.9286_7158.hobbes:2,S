Sorry to waste bandwidth here, but I think Robert is overstating the
omnipotence of Linus. Before I get 1001 flames for that, I'll just state
that I'm speaking in the unspeakable hypothetical here... :-)
If people agreed that a feature was needed and Linus was the sole person who
didn't want it in, he could be over-ruled. I believe the GPL the way it is
would allow us to just make it our beastie an new OS (under a new name if
need be) and everyone works on that leaving Linus' personal Linux to die.
Linus is the God of Linux just because we all trust him to be. He could just
as easily not be.
All that blasphemy said, let's just continue with the peer review of ideas
and code and if we agree it is a good thing, submit it to Linus. Let's not
wear him out with trivialities. Linus is our leader because we choose to
have him as our leader and he is a worthy one. Wasting his time is not good
for any of us. Always keep in mind that he is a human being with limited
resources. Make wise use of him. Bounce ideas of each other first.  Let them
mature and prove themselves. I'll do my part testing and I'll and keep
offering Linus and family a Rocky Mountain vacation away from Linux every
time he looks like he is about to crack under the strain. :-)
-Eric ;-)
Please just flame me directly if you choose to. There is other more
important work to be done on the list. (My wife and I be kayaking the Grand
Canyon for three weeks in just a bit, so I won't get the flames anyway. :-)
