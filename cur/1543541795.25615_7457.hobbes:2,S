Hi Sasa,
Basically, it looks like it's trying to find out which sleep states your pc
supports, but the data being returned is not in the format expected (the
code is at linux/drivers/acpi/hardware/hwregs.c line 176 if you're
interested).
It *should* be fixed, but I don't think it will hurt anything for it to be
temporarily broken...
Regards -- Andy
