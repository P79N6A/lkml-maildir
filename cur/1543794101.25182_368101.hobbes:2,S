Hi,
The following series of patches is designed to make swsusp free only as much
memory as necessary to complete the suspend and not as much as possible.
This speeds up the suspend substantially and makes the system much more
responsive after resume, especially on machines with a lot of RAM.
The patches are against 2.6.15-rc1-mm1.
They have been acked by Pavel (Pavel please confirm).
Please apply (please drop any previous iterations of these patches if you have
them queued).
Greetings,
Rafael
