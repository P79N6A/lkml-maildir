[Argh!  I thought I sent this earlier this morning.  Sorry, Mark, Alan, Andre 
and Andries. ]
Hello all,
I'm just acting as a liaison here.  This is what the sys admins want to know 
about IDE DMA "things", so I'm just forwarding on their questions.
From Ray Pasetes (rayp@fnal.gov):
1) What are all causes for an ide bus to reset?  I can see some in the
   source code, but some of that stuff I don't understand.  Other than
   power management, are there any other causes -- i.e. what if the
   cpu is at 99.9% busy and there is a request from a new process to write/read
   from the disk.  Will the process be temporarily blocked while until
   it gets cpu to access I/O which could cause a timeout via the ide
   driver and have the bus reset?
2) Would it be possible to get a debug version of the code so that we
   can find out where/what/when the ide bus gets reset.
Here's more information on the systems:
   Our systems are running 99.9% constant.  Once an hour we force 2 
   1GB disk writes and 2 1GB disk reads, in addition to the current
   load.  The systems are configured as:
50 Eternal Graphics
   Intel Lancewood (GX chipset) MB
   2x PIII 500MHz CPUs
   512MB memory
   2x 18GB WD IDE disk drives WDC AC418000D
100 Hi-Tech PCs
    ASUS P2BD MB
    2x PIII 500Mhz CPUs
    512MB memory
    2x 17.2 GB Maxtor disk drives Maxtor 91700U5
    Both systems are using Ultra 66 disk drives (could this be a problem)?
    Don Holmgren also has Ultra 66 drives but has not seen this problem.
    In fact, a lot of people haven't seen this problem.  
Again, thanks in advance.
Dan
