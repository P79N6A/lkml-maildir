Not so far as I've checked Jeff.  I normally run x here and the 
console is basicly for emergencies in my mindset.

I'm not seeing that, and its more than occasionally missing a keypress 
I know darned well I hit.   ATM its not doing it, but then I'm 
rebooted to -rc4 due to instability in final.  I've canceled an 
option I had set in the -finals .config, and a fresh copy is making 
now.  So we'll be able to go back to testing -final in a short.

I can't say as I've ever noticed it from the first 6 vt's.
