There may be a problem here, and maybe not:
All of the actions above _may_ require disk access.  The shell you type
into could be swapped out, for example.  A slow disk will be a problem
in that case, swapin won't happen until the disk head seeks to
the relevant position, and that may be delayed by the write.  Even
if the cpu is capable of doing other work while IO is going on.

Devices generally get the cpu before anything else.  A good disk system
don't need much cpu.  Running IDE in PIO mode require a lot
of cpu though.   Using any of the DMA modes avoids that.

dma, udma, etc. is that switch.  It lets the cpu do other work (such as
redrawing X) while the disk is busy.  Plain ide is what you don't want.
The problem of waiting for other files or swapping while a really big
write
is going on is different.  Get more drives, so the big writes go
to one drive while you get stuff swapped in (or other file access)
on other drive(s).  The kernel is capable of getting fast response
from one drive while another is completely bogged down with
enormous writes.
