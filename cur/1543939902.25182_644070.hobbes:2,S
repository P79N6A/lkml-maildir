Hi,
Some people mailed about the scsi_wait_scan module being built every
time (without any way to disable it). Why any patch has been applied
to change this behavior?
As I understand the documentation, the module is only useful "if you
have built SCSI as modules" and "Asynchronous SCSI scanning" is
enabled.
Should not be -at least- a way to disable it?
