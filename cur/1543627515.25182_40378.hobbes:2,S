This is interesting.  What exactly is buffers and cache used for?
I had the same issue with the original poster with a new server.  A 
fresh install with nothing significant running ( no bind nor sendmail, 
etc. ) reported that over 450 out of 512 MB was used, but looking at the 
process usage on top I barelly got 5% memory usuage by process.  If the 
above calculation ( memory use = total - buffers - cache ) is correct 
then the memory use drops to ~100 MB.
I guess what's confusing is that total memory usuage is including 
buffers and cache.  If that memory is available to applications, 
shouldn't it be removed from the "total used" figure?
