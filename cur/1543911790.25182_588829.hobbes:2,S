Hello folks,
I recently pick up the implementation of arch_align_stack() from x86
architectures to make it available for mips.
But now I just realised that this function seems useless because of
the way it's used.
Currently, this function seems to be only used to randomize the stack
pointer inside a page during an execve() syscall. Only i386, x86_64
and recently mips do that. Here is the code taken from exec.c which
calls it:
	int setup_arg_pages(struct linux_binprm *bprm,
			    unsigned long stack_top,
			    int executable_stack)
	{
		[...]
	
		stack_top = arch_align_stack(stack_top);
		stack_top = PAGE_ALIGN(stack_top);
	
		[...]
	}
Since PAGE_ALIGN() is called right after arch_align_stack(), it seems
to me that the call to the latter function is useless...
Am I missing something ?
thanks
		Franck
