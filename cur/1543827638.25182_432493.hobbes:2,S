Hi All!
I am serching for an mechanism which does the following:
visiblity control:
Where a hardware buffer has to be visible to the user space.
I believe I can use mmap.
async notification:
As soon as the  hardware buffer completion is done. It has to be
signalled/callbacked to the user-space, and the corresponding handler
to the signal runs.
Can any one point out the source/docs for such a mechanism.
Thanks+,
krs
