$YACC now seems to be undefined when I do a "make bzImage" and the
build process gets to drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aicasm (with the aic7xxx
driver configured as a built-in).  As a workaround, it's possible to
"cd" into the indicated directory and run "make" directly.  Once the
default build completes, restarting "make bzImage" from the kernel
source root continues as expected.
This problem did not exist with 2.6.17.
