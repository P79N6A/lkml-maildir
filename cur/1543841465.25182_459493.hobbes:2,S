I looked at this over a year ago, and my feeble recollection is
that if _STA says "not present", we don't do the device_add.  Later,
when _STA changes to "present", we get an ACPI notification.  I
expected that we would just do the device_add() at that time, and
there are even comments in acpi_bus_check_device() that suggest that,
but it just looks unfinished.
It seemed like it would be much cleaner to finish that up, and then
the driver's .add method would automatically get called, and the
memory driver wouldn't have to bother with all the notification stuff.
