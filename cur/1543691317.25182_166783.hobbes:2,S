I wouldn't worry about performance as much as correctness. I'm a lot more
worried about the notion of taking recursive pagefaults than about 2%.
Which means that I think the code should be disabled on non-buggy 
hardware. Not becuase of the 2%, but because it just exposes the potential 
of new bugs.
