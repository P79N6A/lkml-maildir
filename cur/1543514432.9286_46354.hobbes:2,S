Hi!
I'm still experiencing severe data corruption in 2.3.24-ikd.
I see inodes with their block numbers overwritten by -2, I see files
with mode of -1. Gcc 2.7.2 issue seems to be fixed in 2.3.24...
Data corruption is so bad that I can not (for example) recompile
kernel on 2.3.24-ikd system. Not by far.
