access_ok() is just "we can trust MMU to do the right thing when dealing
with access to process address space at that address".  On platforms with
secondary address spaces (e.g. sparc) it's always true.  On something like
i386 we *could* use segments for the same purposes.  In fact, we used to
do just that - access to userland memory went with %fs as segment (thus
the names like extinct memcpy_fromfs() and surviving set_fs()).  However,
it's cheaper to do that check explicitly instead of relying on MMU.  And
that's what access_ok() does.
