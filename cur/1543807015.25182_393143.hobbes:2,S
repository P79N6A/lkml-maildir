I doubt it's anything new in 2.6.15.2.

That's #2 so there should have been an earlier one, but never mind...

ATI's fglrx is Tainting your kernel.

Yes, fglrx definitely looks implicated.  ATI were carefully coding
around an anomaly in our page count handling, then 2.6.15 removed
that anomaly, so their wrapper code needs an additional #ifdef on
Linux kernel version.  I'll forward you offline what Martin Drab
posted a few weeks back.
