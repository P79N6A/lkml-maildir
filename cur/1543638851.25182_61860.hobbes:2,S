This looks pretty silly if you think about it. We support
both 8 kB UFS and 64 kB FAT16 already.

Um, yeah, 64 TB of data with 192 TB of holes!
I really don't think you should count a file
that won't fit on your filesystem.
It's one thing to say ext2 is ready for when
the block devices grow. It's another thing to
talk about files that can't possibly fit without
changing the filesystem layout.

It's nice to have a simple filesystem. If you turn ext2/ext3
into an XFS/JFS competitor, then what is left? Just minix fs?
