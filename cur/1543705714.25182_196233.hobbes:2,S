Looks ok, but the thing should be made a function (possibly inline, 
depending on how big the code generated ends up being). As it is, it now 
uses its arguments several times, and while I don't see anything where 
that could screw up, it's just a tad scary.
Also, related to this whole mess, what the _heck_ is this in mm/rmap.c:
        if (!pfn_valid(page_to_pfn(page)) || PageReserved(page))
                return pte_chain;
that "pfn_valid(page_to_pfn(page))" just looks totally nonsensical. Can
somebody really pass in random page pointers to this thing, and if so, are
they guaranteed to be "not-random enough" to not cause bogus behaviour
when the "page_to_pfn()" happens to be valid..
If VM_IO gets rid of this, then we should immediately apply the patch.
