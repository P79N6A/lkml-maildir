I forgot to mention I will not be booting off of any of the SATA disks, 
so that should cover the BIOS issues by just ignoring them.

I saw that message; I won't have the hardware until late next week, so 
I'll watch to see what happens with the snapshot/-testX situation by then.
I'll have about three weeks to use the machine for "whatever" before I 
have to start preparing it for its real purpose, so if there's any 
stress tests or anything I else I can run that would be useful let me know.
