I bet it is exactly the thing which Angrea sees. /proc/net/tcp
violates main anti-dead lock rule.

Transitions LISTEN <-> CLOSE occur only in process context.
It was the only thing which was able to save us of intrinsic
lock clash, but I cheated myself and used it incorrectly.
OK... Then scenario #2 (refused earlier) is still appropriate.
But it will cost us spinlock in accept() and, seems, closes
perspective to make backlog processing in release_sock()
not holding spinlock...
Do you see? We kill sleep lock for lhash and revert it to rwlock.
/proc/net/tcp grabs socket spinlock (violating anti-dead lock rule),
but does not check for users.
All manipulations with syn queue made in process context (i.e. accept())
also grab spinlock in addition(!) to "users" count. Deadlock is avoided
because (and while) lhash lock is never acquired while socket spinlock
is held.
