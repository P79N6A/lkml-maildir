No, we don't want that.  It's ok to have a dangling symlink in the fs if
the device the link was pointing to is now gone.  All of the struct
class_device stuff relies on the fact that a struct device can go away
at any time, and nothing bad will happen (with the exception of a stale
symlink.)
Yeah, it can cause a few odd looking trees when you unplug and replug a
device a bunch of times, all the while grabbing a reference to the class
device, but once everything is released by the user, it is cleaned up
properly, with no harm done to anything.
