See "kallsyms_lookup_name" in include/linux/kallsyms.h (implemented in 
kernel/kallsyms.c).
Beware:
  - CONFIG_KALLSYMS might be undefined. In that case it always returns 0
  - the function returns the address of *any* known symbol, not just 
functions (this can be easily improved to also return the symbol type)
  - the function is extremely inefficient, as it does a linear search 
over all the symbols. kallsyms is optimized to work the other way 
around: get the name from the address.
