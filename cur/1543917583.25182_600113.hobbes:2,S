I'll offer this suggestion, knowing it may piss you off, given the 
difficulty of preserving whitespace on *many* mailers without using 
attachments, and given that attachments can be saved easily without 
prying them out of the message, why don't you (one person) switch to a 
capable mail agent, if only for patches, instead of trying to teach many 
people to jump through hoops to avoid whitespace issues?
Not criticizing, just seems easier for everybody for you to avoid 
teaching people things they don't find useful elsewhere, or getting 
discouraged and not bothering.
