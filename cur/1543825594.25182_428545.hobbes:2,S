Neil wasn't suggesting making PG_lock a spinning lock, he was
suggesting a further bit used that way.  And I thought his suggestion
was relevant to the bug at hand.  But it's not the way I'd like to go.

Yes, I had noticed yours is a different issue.  I'm saying that if we
can "fix" set_page_dirty_nolock not to sleep, then your issue is fixed
(as least as it affects set_page_dirty_lock, which is all your patch
is dealing with, and we hope all it needs to deal with).  Because your
issue is with the sync_page in the lock_page of set_page_dirty_nolock,
and it's that particular lock_page which I'm trying to be rid of.
I now think it can be done: in cases where TestSetPageLocked finds
the page already locked, then I believe we can fall back to inode_lock
to stabilize.  But I do need to consider the possibilities some more.

Which would equally deal with your issue.  Yes, but it's always
seemed to me too great a risk, to add an RCU delay into such
significant slab shrinking - I don't want to handle the fallout.

I've not looked recently, but bio.c sticks in the mind as one which
is pushed to the full contortions to allow for sleeping there.
