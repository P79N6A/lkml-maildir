You probably have to stress some more since the page cache is _very_
effective on Linux. I can bring down a kernel compile on a 8way
machine with parallel make from ~44 seconds to ~40 seconds which is a
real speedup ;-)
Actually I really doubt a real speed benefit for normal users with
tmpfs but there may be other benefits:
- 'add swap on any device and your tmpfs grows' can be really valuable. 
- Automatic cleanup of /tmp on reboot
- No traces of temporary files on backing store may help the crypto
  people. (But no if you swap that argument is hosed.)
- ???
There are some people out there which really wanted to have this and
it was a minor task to add the full support to shm fs.
Greetings
