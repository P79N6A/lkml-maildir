I disagree. I think it would be better to get rid of the hard-coded
table altogether and let something in the machine-specific code call
register_serial() during early boot.
Even on PeeCee hardware, that lets us do the superio chip probe and
potentially register high-speed serial ports, before the pnpbios probe
and finally falling back to the old standard I/O addresses.
