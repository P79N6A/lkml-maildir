I haven't tried your kernel patches (yet). I was happy with a mixture of
2.2.12 (clients) and 2.2.13pre14 (servers) until I needed a recompile
because of new hardware (network 10->100MBit upgrade), and that's where the
problems started.
I just realized though that I compiled some of the kernels with gcc 2.95.2
(19991019), that might also have been a problem. I'll check on this.
I didn't use the kernel nfs until now because last time the systems were
upgraded and I checked the list, there was too many stability issues being
discussed for me to switch.

I'll start one next time I get these errors. I sent some of the Oops
messages that I got some time ago to linux-kernel (but, mysteriously, don't
any more, although the crashes still occur). It would be nice if you could
give me some hints as to where to look. I will have to wait for the next
crash (although I _do_ hope they will go away..) =;)
Thanks again.
