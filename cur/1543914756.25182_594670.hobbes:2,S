Except that the applications 7 pages are movable and the <something>
would have to be unmovable. And then they should not share the same
memory region. At least they should never be allowed to interleave in
such a pattern on a larger scale.
The only way a fragmentation catastroph can be (proovable) avoided is
by having so few unmovable objects that size + max waste << ram
size. The smaller the better. Allowing movable and unmovable objects
to mix means that max waste goes way up. In your example waste would
be 7*size. With 2MB uper order limit it would be 511*size.
I keep coming back to the fact that movable objects should be moved
out of the way for unmovable ones. Anything else just allows
fragmentation to build up.
