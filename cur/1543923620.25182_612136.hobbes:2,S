the problem is... you're not supposed to mix both types of accesses.

I would suggest a slight twist then: use CONF1 *until* you're using
something above 256, and then and only then switch to MMCONFIG from
then on for all accesses.
That should solve the spec issue (yes I know about specs, but this is
one of those things that will bite us in the future if we're not
careful)
