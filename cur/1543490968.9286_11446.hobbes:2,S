This is feasible. Oracle comes with a tool called genksms which, invoked,
 generates output to redirect in a .s file which contains the SGA begin
 address symbol (sgabeg). In fact,
[oracle@dogbert bin]$ genksms|head -5
	 .set	sgabeg,0X20000000
	 .globl	 ksmsgf_
	 .set	 ksmsgf_,sgabeg+0
	 .globl	 ksmvsg_
	 .set	 ksmvsg_,sgabeg+4
[oracle@dogbert bin]$ 
Check ins_rdbms.mk for further details on how to relink Oracle to
 start with a different sgabeg.
I'll try and reproduce it locally since I got different behaviors
 with different values for Oracle init params and different SHMMAX's.
