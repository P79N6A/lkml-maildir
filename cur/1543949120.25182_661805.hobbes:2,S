We should just check the return value from irq_set_affinity(). If it fails we 
refuse to add it to the set.

I guess there maybe some fancy HW topologies that may be a problem but for 
most cases we should be ok.
Simple cases like unmovable IRQs are easy to handle (ie set_affinity() fails 
and we refuse to add it to the cpuset).

Yeah, I'd prefer it to be along with cpusets. As I mentioned will need similar 
mechanisms for other things besides irqs for complete isolation. Creating a 
separate group for each sounds like an overkill.
