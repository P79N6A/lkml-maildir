Well, perhaps the device isn't consistently writing data to the 
correct locations.

Pete is quite as competent at solving this kind of problem as I am.  And
he knows the ub driver much better, so I'm happy to bow out and let him
worry about it!  :-)
Just out of curiosity, if you plug the player into a Windows system 
without installing any special drivers first, will Windows be able to read 
and write files okay?  If it can, a USB packet trace may give Pete a clue 
as to where to look.
