Linux switch 2.2.14 #24 SMP Wed Feb 16 10:57:47 EST 2000 i686 unknown
When I had module versions enabled the tulip module won't load.  I later
recompiled without it and it worked.  Is module versions a known SMP
problem?   Also when can I expect SMP with AMP?  Thanks for the kernel.
-- off topic --
Is user mode kernel going to become a supported "arch" for linux?  
cheers,
Terry
