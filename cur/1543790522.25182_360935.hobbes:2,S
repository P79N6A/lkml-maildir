These are patches designed to improve system responsiveness and interactivity. 
It is configurable to any workload but the default ck* patch is aimed at the

Changes:
Added:
+adaptive-readahead-4.patch
We Fengguang's adaptive readahead patch. Please test and report experiences - 
Wu has been cc'ed on this email, please keep him cc'ed for reports.
+set_workqueue_nice-1.patch
Add a function to set workqueue nice levels
+dm-drop_kcryptd_prio.patch
Use the above function to set kcryptd priority to nice 0 since kcryptd 
consumes massive amounts of cpu. This code is safe but I don't even know if 
it's successfully changing priority yet.
Updated:
~2.6.14_to_staircase12.1.diff
Rolled up staircase tweaks
~mm-swap_prefetch-18.patch
