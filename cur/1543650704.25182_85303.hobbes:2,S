Why don't you do that from within fsync_super()?  That would be much
more natural point for such stuff...
I hadn't looked into akpm's stuff in fs-writeback.c for a while, but
if one can't stick such flush point in there I'd argue that this is
a bug that needs to be fixed - either there or by providing explicit
callback from fsync_super().
Note that sync(2) doesn't get anywhere near your ->kill_sb() code,
so you want fsync_super() do the right thing anyway - regardless of the
umount(2) situation.
