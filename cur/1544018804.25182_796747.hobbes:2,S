Good work Jon.  I think something like this will be helpful.
Any reason why you could not do SMI detection in user level code running
at the highest RT priority?  If something is running at the highest RT
priority, it should not be preempted by anything.  Right?  In the past,
we discoved discovered periodic SMIs on some hardware platforms by running
a user level process in an infinite loop sampling the clock and reporting
unexpected delays.  Of course, this does hog an entire CPU.
