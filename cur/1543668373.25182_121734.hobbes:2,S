Subject: PATCH: allow percentile size of tmpfs (2.5.66 / 2.4.20-pre2)

I believe the patch below will apply to both the above (I know it does
to 2.5.66 and 2.4.20-pre2 mm/shmem.c does not look any different so it
should be fine. :)
Anyways, what this patch does is allow you to specify the max amount of
memory tmpfs can use as a percentage of available real ram. This (in my
eyes) is useful so that you do not have to remember to change the
setting if you want something other then 50% and some of your ram does
(and you can't replacew it immediately).
Usage of this option is as follows:
tmpfs      /dev/shm tmpfs  rw,size=63%,noauto            0 0
This is taken from my working system and sets the tmpfs size to 63% of
my real RAM (256MB). The end result is:
Filesystem           1k-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/shm/tmp            160868      6776    154092   5% /tmp
I've also tested remounting to silly values (and sane ones) and it all
works fine with no oopses or freezes and the correct values appearing
in df.
All up I feel safer using this then a hard value.
Please apply. :)
