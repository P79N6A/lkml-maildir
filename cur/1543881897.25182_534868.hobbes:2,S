There are general funnies in the menuconfig world (my preference) here.
For instance, I recently had reason to change/test different default IO
schedulers, and found that no matter what I did, I couldn't select a
default IO scheduler any more, though I used to be able to do so.  If I
totally whack my .config, i.e. use default config, I still _can't
select_.  If I take my current .config back to a kernel where I could
select (a 2.6.16 tree i still have lying about) I can't select either,
but with the config I had at the time, I could/can select just fine.  If
I use xconfig (don't really like, but...) I can select, and a manual
edit would likely also work just fine.
Box is P4, with SuSe 10.2.. haven't had time to see if maybe there's
some weird userland ncurses problem.  Just a note in case others are
seeing problems in this area.   Not much of a bug report I know, but
maybe useful for readers and those who keep strange events in the backs
of their minds ;)
