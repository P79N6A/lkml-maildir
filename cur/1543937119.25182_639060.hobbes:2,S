your userspace program is somewhat broken
the userspace should not expect to find the version number in
/sys/module, as this is used by the Linux kernel module subsystem. You
should provide the required information in another way such as a
/proc/ file (bad) or a /sys file (better, but no module stuff, this
has no business with it).
