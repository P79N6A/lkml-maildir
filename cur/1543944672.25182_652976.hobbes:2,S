not normally, but i don't know what you mean by "bogus":
  $ grep -r "config 405EX" *
  arch/powerpc/platforms/40x/Kconfig:config 405EX
  $
  $ grep -r CONFIG_405EX *
  arch/powerpc/configs/makalu_defconfig:CONFIG_405EX=y
  arch/powerpc/configs/kilauea_defconfig:CONFIG_405EX=y
  $
so, AFAICT, there exists a definition of the Kconfig variable 405EX,
which is subsequently not referenced *anywhere* in the tree except in
a couple defconfig files, which don't count.  how, then, does that
Kconfig variable have any practical value?  or am i missing something
painfully obvious?

fair enough, but since this scanning happens only once every release,
it's not like it's a burden.  and if people want to ignore it, that's
fine, too.
