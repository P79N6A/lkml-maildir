The thing is that there are lots of neat applications for this sort of
thing in the kernel as well.
The fact is that there is no way to make a program (that has been written
ignorant of the type of machine it will be run on) faster just by adding
some kernel module or kernel tricks to make it run the processes on other
machines.  You have to write the program thinking of how to parallelize
sections of code that don't have data-dependency issues.  This sort of
thing is done in threaded programming as well but in a different way
because of the nature of threads.  Parallelizing code is done in any
application where performance is an issue.
All I'm suggesting is that there are some applications that fit the model
of many machines working in harmony and coordinating their actions than
one machine trying to do it all.  And I further suggest that if there are
ways to do this in a uniform way through a sufficiently tailored
abstraction layer, then making it a part of the kernel, even as a loadable
module, is worth a bit of thought.
Programmers have enough to worry about without trying to add a layer of
complexity to their code.  A good toolkit that did the work for them and
worked within the framework for process management and interprocess
signalling and communication would be of great value.
Of course, if you don't that stuff you can just compile a kernel without
them... :)
