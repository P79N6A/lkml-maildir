In case if people will help Google to have better quality of translation,
that will be better generally for much bigger number of *people*,
especially in China, isn't it?
Making any official world-domination/new-world-order projects with
Linux will not help IMHO. Very fast code flow and almost no up to date
documentation is still relevant and google search + email archives
are not going to be obsolete in the near future.
Also, future of the linux codebase with Chinese comments in C or in
ASM is kind of wired nightmare. Those, who cannot read actual source
code (i.e. C) will not go too far.
So, translation guys, maybe you will stop making noise and will start
to make e.g. less buggy Linux? Greg KH have much more stuff to care,
than some translations IMHO.
