The reasons -rcs are not as good as they could be is that they include 
more than just bug fixes.  Users are discouraged from testing because 
they must scan LKML, or guess, which -rc that Linus/Andrew started 
getting serious about "bugfixes only."
With the -pre/-rc scheme, it's clear to users.
With the even/odd scheme, you just devalue releases.  Previously, all 
releases were worthy of testing and use.  Now, half of them aren't.
