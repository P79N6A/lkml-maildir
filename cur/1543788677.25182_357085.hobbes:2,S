You're assuming your code would get merged.
More than that, though, let me be bold enough to say that your version
has quite a lot of development to do in order to begin to approach the
level of Suspend2. If and when it achieves that, I'll happily stop
maintaining Suspend2 - after all, I've always said I'm just a user who
wants to suspend. In the meantime, though, I'm happy to carry that can
while you're developing your userspace implementation. That way, users
can have the best of both worlds - a stable, reliable, fast and mature
implementation in kernel space while you're getting userspace working,
and then whatever advantages you bring once your version becomes  an
improved version of Suspend2.
Regards,
Nigel
