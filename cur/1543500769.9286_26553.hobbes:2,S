I have 3 machines I tested on.
1: dual pII450 running @ 504mhz 256mb ram (using mtrr)
2: single p233mmx running @ 262mhz 64mb ram
3: dual p233mmx running @ 233mhz 256mb ram (using mtrr)
computer 1 compiles 2.2.10 in ~ 3 minutes
computer 2 compiles 2.2.10 in ~ 11 minutes
computer 3 compiles 2.2.10 in > 20 minutes
Anyone know why #3 is 2x slower as #2 (2 is uniproc and 3 is dualproc with
the same chip)
