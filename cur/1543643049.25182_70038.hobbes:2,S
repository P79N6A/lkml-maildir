As open() immediately returns, it does not matter by which call the readahead is
triggered. But I'm unsure about wether it is triggered at all for the amount of
data the read() requested.

AFAIK, "man open" tells
[...]
      int open(const char *pathname, int flags);
[...]
       O_NONBLOCK or O_NDELAY
               The file is opened in non-blocking mode. Neither the open nor any
__subsequent__ operations  on  the  file  descriptor
               which is returned will cause the calling process to wait.
[...]
So read won't block if the file has been opened with O_NONBLOCK.

Aio would help me announcing stat() usage for the future?
