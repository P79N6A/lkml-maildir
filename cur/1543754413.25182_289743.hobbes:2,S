Ok, for me here, the bottom line is that decent hardware will not benefit
from help from the allocator. Worse, if the work required to provide
adjacent pages is high, it will even adversly affect throughput. I know as
well that to have physically contiguous pages in userspace would involve a
fair amount of overhead so even if we devise a system for providing them,
it would need to be a configurable option.
I will keep an eye out for a means of granting physically contiguous pages
for userspace in a lightweight manner but I'm going to focus on general
availability of large pages for TLBs, extend the system for a pool of
zero'd pages and how it can be adapted to help out the hotplug folks.
The system I have in mind for contiguous pages for userspace right now is
to extend the allocator API so that prefaulting and readahead will request
blocks of pages for userspace rather than a series of order-0 pages. So,
if we prefault 32 pages ahead, the allocator would have a new API that
would return 32 pages that are physically contiguous. That, in combination
with forced IOMMU may show if Contiguous Pages For IO is worth it or not.
This will take a while as I'll have to develop some mechanism for
measuring it while I'm at it and I only do this 2 days a week so it'll
take a while.
