I'm using 2.6.22.5 with cfs v20.3 and  suspend2  2.2.10.2.
With that combination, suspend is not working anymore (with cfs v19
was working).
Stops on suspend in "Suspending tasks"
Looking at cfs patch, I managed to change the  migration_thread,
adding again the  try_to_freeze() removed in last patch and now the
suspend finished, but resume not work. Of course I don't know why that
was removed, and rewriting it is not a solution, but I want to report
it.
All that in a core duo machine.
