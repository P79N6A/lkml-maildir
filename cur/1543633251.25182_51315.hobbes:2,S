Does the proposed patch give full symlink support or does it just read .lnk
files?  Most source tarballs will not have .lnk files in them, they will have
symlinks.  Would tar create the .lnk files if it was extracting to vfat?  If the
patch gives symlink support in some other way than .lnk files, why can't we just
use that and not meddle with reading the .lnk files to allow Linux to run in a
vfat partition.

This is why I think MS will (and are) killing FAT 32 as quickly as they can (the
last properly understood MS filesystem...).  To really entice users from Windows
in the future, this kind of patch is going to have to work on NTFS, not FAT. 
Now that the NT codebase is the "home" codebase as well (with the advent of XP),
NTFS is going to take massive inroads into FAT's market share.  And there have
been rumours for a while that MS SQL Server is going to form the basis of the
next MS filesystem.
