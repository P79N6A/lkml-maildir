Hi,
this is a series of patches that unify the struct desc_struct and friends
across x86_64 and i386. As usual, it provides paravirt capabilities as a
side-effect for x86_64.
I consider the main goal, namely, of unifying the desc_struct, an ongoing
effort, being this the beginning. A lot of old code has to be touched to
accomplish that. 
I don't consider this patch ready for inclusion. Basically, the main reason
is that I change the signatures of write_idt_entry(), write_gdt_entry(), and
write_ldt_entry(). This is needed to account for the differences between the
two architectures. (For example, gate descriptors in x86_64 are 16-byte long
and can't be represented by low and high entries). As my patch series were
64-bit only, I hadn't come across the problem before.
I think this interface is sane, but I'd like to hear opinions. Specially
from Jeremy and Zach, since it would touch xen and vmi code. The later, by
the way, is _not_ included in this series. Being the interface acked, we
still have to write it.
Thanks in advance for the review in opinions to come.
