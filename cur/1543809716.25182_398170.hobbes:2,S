That won't always suffice.
I have machines at work that will place some PCI resources above the
4GB boundary even when booting in '32-bit OS' mode (there is a BIOS
option for this but no matter the setting some resources always end up
above 4GB).  I've heard from others they've also been hit by this
(with 64-bit kernels it's fine).  I guess it could be argued that it's
a BIOS bug, I'm not entirely sure what to thing,  Windows seems to
deal with it.
