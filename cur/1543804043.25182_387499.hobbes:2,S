Hi,
Patch looks fine some comments below:

Yep.

The core logic is changed (in the positive way): ata_pio_modes()
is finally used for obtaining PIO mask to be used.
Please update the patch description or make it a separate change.
The other functional change is the ordering of programming host/devices:
previously:
* program PIO for device 0 [host]
* program PIO for device 1 [host]
* program DMA for device 0 [host]
* program DMA for device 1 [host]
* program xfer mode for device 0 [device]
* program xfer mode for device 1 [device]
now:
* program PIO for device 0 [host]
* program DMA for device 0 [host]
* program xfer mode for device 0 [device]
* program PIO for device 1 [host]
* program DMA for device 1 [host]
* program xfer mode for device 0 [device]
This change is OK but I wonder what is the reason for it?

I thought it was merged already (it is obviously correct)?
Thanks,
