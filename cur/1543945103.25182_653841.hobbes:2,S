Found this page:
http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-installation-40/cddvd-not-found-584582/page2.html
and a solution therein: "pci=nommconf" or disable CONFIG_PCI_MMCONFIG. 
Now, I don't understand why PCI_MMCONFIG is twice in ./arch/x86/Kconfig 
and maybe one has to be a bit more careful when defaulting it to "y".
Thanks
