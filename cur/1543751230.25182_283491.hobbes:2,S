The recent OOM kill problem has been happening:
1) with cache pressure on lowmem only, due to a block device write
2) with no block congestion at all
3) with pretty much all pageable lowmme pages in writeback state
It appears the VM has trouble dealing with the situation where
there is no block congestion to wait on...
