In hosts.c HOSTS_C (or something like that) is defined so that driver
header files can avoid this while keeping commonly used names, i.e:
#ifdef HOSTS_C
   ... only the stuff required for compiling hosts.c ...
#else
   ... all the private #defines to be seen only by my driver
#endif
This saves trying to come up with 1001 unique names for things
like SCB_COMPLETE.
Paul.
