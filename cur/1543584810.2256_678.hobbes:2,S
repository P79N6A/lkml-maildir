No. But I hoped _you_ might :-)

Hmm.  My /etc/auto.opt contains
*       :/export/opt/&/LATEST
where all the "LATEST"s etc are symlinks.  I found it quite
an elegant way to maintain different versions: the symlink
was de-facto a trivially simple version database.
Does the version state now *have* to be listed in
/etc/auto.opt explicitly?  That feels a little retrograde.
Perhaps I'm blissfully unaware of all sorts of vile
race conditions, but why can't the *automounter* chase
the symlinks even if mount shouldn't?  Or am I missing
a neater solution?
