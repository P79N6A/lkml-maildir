Well, I have high and low, I currently report both avg and median values,
and both average and "deviant mean average" compared to the noload case.
The test is almost ready for public release, I just have to finish the
docs. I know, if it was hard to write it should be hard to understand...
*deviant mean average - the average of all data points within one S.D. of
the mean. Average of "the stuff in the middle of the performance range."
