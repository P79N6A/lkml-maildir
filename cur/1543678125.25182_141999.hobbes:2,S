I believe the original malloc/free code came from the "C programming language"
way back around 1975-79".
Almost all of the base allocators came out of that book. And it was listed
only as "a memory allocator", and the algorithms go back even farther. (I was
taught that one using a fortran array around 1973.. and was told then that
it had been used by IBM/CDC/... for memory allocation in assembler...)
Really.. there are only so many different ways to allocate memory, and this is
one of the most basic. Lisp interpreters always had the most elaborate and
complete ones, including this one. It is only slightly more complex than the
old stack "mark/release" allocator in Pascal.
