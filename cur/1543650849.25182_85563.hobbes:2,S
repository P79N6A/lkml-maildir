Thank you, since all the systems I have been using for 2.5 testing are
SMP, I just thought sound was broken in general. And still may be, since I
found that some audio CD's I burned with 2.5 are just noise while the same
hardware burned CD's from the same batch of blanks using 2.4.19+patches.
Using SMP. I'll try a uni burn tomorrow.
