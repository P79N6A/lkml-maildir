__relay_reset() runs flush_scheduled_work().  If one of the queued works
takes lock_cpu_hoplug() (and some do), thou art most deadest meat.
I think the core design problem you have here is that you are using
cpu_online_map to record the presence or absence of resources which belong
to the relay driver.  Why do that - you don't own cpu_online_map (but you
do get some notifications when it wants to change, that's all).
Perhaps a better approach would be to teach the relay driver to maintain
its own resources (already there, in chan->buf[]).  So relay.c has a record
of which per-cpu buffers are present and which are not.  That information
gets changed under a lock which the relay driver owns and controls.
You already have such a lock: relay_channels_mutex.  So some code in here
is using lock_cpu_hotplug() to protect relay's resources while other code
is using relay_channels_mutex.    Which is it?
Your proposed change apparently chooses to not release per-cpu resources on
cpu-hotunplug.  I think.  That's the sort of thing which should be
communicated in the (presently non-existent) patch changelog.
The changelog should also tell us *why* this patch was written.  Right now
it's in "why on earth should we merge this" territory.
Meanwhile, let's shrink 10% off of relay.o's .text, shall we?
