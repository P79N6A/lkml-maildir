maybe I'm overlooking something but after a short read it seems you have
no lock in do_truncate->setattr like for all the other fs, so the
vmtruncate can run under reads and the i_size can change under you and
in turn you must always read it with i_size_read using asm, like all the
other fs, if you're not holding the i_sem (and you certainly aren't
holding the i_sem that frequently, you don't even for writes). this
because i_sem  is the only lock/sem hold by truncate.  Infact I'm unsure
how you serialize the i_size writes of truncate against the ones from
writes, that seems problematic too, the i_size could get a value past
the last block allocated (in turn corrupting the fs). Please double
check that I'm wrong, thanks.
