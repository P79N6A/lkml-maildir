Actually, there are several applications of low-cost RNG inside the kernel.
For Lustre we need a low-cost RNG for generating opaque 64-bit handles in
the kernel.  The use of get_random_bytes() showed up near the top of
our profiles and we had to invent our own low-cost crappy PRNG instead (it's
good enough for the time being, but when we start working on real security
it won't be enough).
The tcp sequence numbers probably do not need to be crypto-secure (I could
of course be wrong on that ;-) and with GigE or 10GigE I imagine the number
of packets being sent would put a strain on the current random pool.
Cheers, Andreas
