Yeah, after some more thought I've not applied most of this.  We really
don't want to move everything then move it back; I prefer Jes' more
cautious approach of moving a little bit at a time.
We really have three parts: (1) bits that are generic, (2) bits that
should be generic but my implementation is naive, (3) bits that really
are i386-specific.
Patches which move 2 to 1 are gratefully accepted: I realize a mass move
is easier and this requires thought, but that's what we need.
Since I can't build a module over two directories, that seems to destroy
the idea of an i386/ subdir.  Instead I've done a patch which renames
the *clearly* i386-specific things to i386_<name>, which at least works.
I've pushed it into the repository 
http://lguest.ozlabs.org/patches/
Cheers,
Rusty.
