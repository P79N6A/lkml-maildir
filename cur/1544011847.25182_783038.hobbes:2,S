hello all,
i am experiencing an issue, similar to the one reported in
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/10/30/319.
each time, i start the oprofile daemon, one NMI per cpu is executed. the
cpu is an intel core2 duo t7400, x86_64 architecture.
root@thinkpad:~# opcontrol -s
Using 2.6+ OProfile kernel interface.
Using log file /var/lib/oprofile/samples/oprofiled.log
Daemon started.
Profiler running.
tim@thinkpad:~/kernel/linux-2.6$ cat /proc/interrupts |grep NMI
NMI:          3          3   Non-maskable interrupts
root@thinkpad:~# opcontrol -h
Stopping profiling.
Killing daemon.
root@thinkpad:~# opcontrol -s
Using 2.6+ OProfile kernel interface.
Using log file /var/lib/oprofile/samples/oprofiled.log
Daemon started.
Profiler running.
tim@thinkpad:~/kernel/linux-2.6$ cat /proc/interrupts |grep NMI
NMI:          4          4   Non-maskable interrupts
oprofile samples are not collected.
commit 7c64ade53a6f977d73f16243865c42ceae999aea, which solved the issue
in the 2.6.28-rc2 regression, is already included in the 2.6.28-rc9
kernel, i am currently running. oprofile works fine with kernel 2.6.27
on the same machine.
best, tim

something exist by observing it. And his hope for other people is that
they will also make it exist by observing it. I call it 'creative
observation.' Creative viewing.
