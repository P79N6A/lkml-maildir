You should be able to see the firmware version using one of the cd
writing tools (cdrecord or dvd+rw-mediainfo or whichever).  Comparing to
what the manufacturer has on offer could at least tell that.  As for
updating, if it isn't a plextor it almost certainly requries windows
and/or dos to update (usually windows it seems).

Well that does sound odd.  Is this your own kernel build from plain
kernel.org sources or are there any patches involved?

As far as I know, promise cards are only recommended for harddisks, but
I am not sure of that.  I have only ever used them for harddisks myself.

Different cables tried?  Just in case you have a bad cable in there?

Sounds painful.
Well so far I have had no problems reading or writing with 2.6.11,
2.6.10, 2.6.8, and some earlier 2.6 kernels (all Debian sarge or sid
builds).
