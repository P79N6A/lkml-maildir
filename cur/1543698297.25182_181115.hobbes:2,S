Now that 2.4.23 is out, could you try to help me getting this (and
possibly NetMos changes) into 2.4.24?  I've just read that 2.4.24
is the last release for which new drivers are accepted, and it's
not even a new driver...  Tim Waugh has been silent about NetMos
problems, and the current version of my patch (made for 2.4.21,
but should apply cleanly to 2.4.23) makes NetMos support a config
option, conditional on CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL.
Thanks,
Marek
