Lots and lots of PPC platforms use BATs for io mappings:
val@evilcat </sys/linuxppc_2_4_devel_pristine/arch/ppc/platforms>$ grep -l ppc_md.setup_io_mappings *
grep: SCCS: Is a directory
adir_setup.c
apus_setup.c
chrp_setup.c
gemini_setup.c
k2_setup.c
lopec_setup.c
mcpn765_setup.c
menf1_setup.c
mvme5100_setup.c
pcore_setup.c
powerpmc250.c
pplus_setup.c
prep_setup.c
prpmc750_setup.c
prpmc800_setup.c
sandpoint_setup.c
spruce_setup.c
zx4500_setup.c
I'm trying to get highmem working on Gemini, hence my interest.

Hm, that's what I thought.  Thanks for confirming that.
