There is almost no difference in the trace, and it is very puzzling. Your
attachments will have been bounced by vger, so I suggest putting these
traces online somewhere.
The weird thing is that the packages.gentoo.org appears to be at fault. It
ignores your valid FIN packets, or at least, they appear to be valid to
ethereal.
There are three differences between these traces:
	1) The IP address of your computer
	2) In the non-working trace, your Mozilla does not pass a
	   'Cache-Control' HTTP header
	3) The broken trace has a timestamp wraparound on your side
Of note is that both gentoo and you set a non-standard MSS (I think).
Suggestions:
	1) turn off timestamps (echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_timestamps)
	2) set your MTU to 1000 or so (ifconfig eth0 mtu 1000)
And try again.
Interesting case!
