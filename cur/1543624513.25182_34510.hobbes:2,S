Wow! Is this box NUMA (what latency ratio, mem access speeds, etc?), or can you really build a straight SMP that big?
OK, now I'm going to have to build a bigger system ;-)

I think we need to fix the final phase .... anyone got any ideas
on parallelizing that?

I have some strange plans for the lru stuff, but it'll take me a while.
I'm curious as to why lru_cache_del is so much lower in your list than
add, whereas the ratio for me is about:
   719 lru_cache_add                              7.8152
   477 lru_cache_del                             21.6818

Do you know what's causing the tlb flushes? Just context switches?

Did you try the dcache patches?
Can you publish lockmeter stats?
Thanks,
