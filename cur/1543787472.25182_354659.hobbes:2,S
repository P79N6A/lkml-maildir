Because I don't know much about those control algorithms, and all the
calibration data provided by the firmware is in the form of factors for
these algorithms, I wouldn't know how to "unmangle" them to use with
different ones.
Actually, the control algorithms (PID and modified PID) are in a
"helper", so it's fairly easy for the platform module to use whatever it
wants, feel free to submit other algorithms :) But for Apple machines,
I'd rather use what I have calibration data for, unless you can produce
something that works without any...
Ben.
