Kernel 2.4.21 causes hangs and/or ooops during boot up if I have a 
"probeall scsi_hostadapter ide-scsi" in my /etc/modules.conf. If I take 
out that line and manually load the module after the laptop has booted, 
everything is fine.
There were no such problems in 2.4.20 or earlier kernels.
Please cc me any responses as I am not on the mailing list.
