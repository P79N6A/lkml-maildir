Hmm, looks much simpler.

I think it's better to avoid to add this check *now*. and "signal is pending" 
doesn't mean oom situation.
Hmm..Maybe we can tell "please retry page fault again, it's too long latency in
memory reclaim and you received signal." in future.
IMHO, only quick path which we can add here now is
==
	if (test_thread_flag(TIG_MEMDIE)) { /* This thread is killed by OOM */
		*memcg = NULL;
		return 0;
	}
==
like this.
Anyway, please discuss this "quick exit path" in other patch and just remove 
siginal check.
Other part looks ok to me.
Thanks,
