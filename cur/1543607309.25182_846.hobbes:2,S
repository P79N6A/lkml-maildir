Hi,

So I've done : get rid of the external i2c package, compiled the built-in i2c
stack. make and make install for the lm_sensors (2.6.1)...
... It does not work
in /proc/sys/dev/sensors/ I've only one empty file called chips
with 2.4.13, I've the following :
[root@debian-f5ibh] ~ # ls /proc/sys/dev/sensors/
chips
w83781d-isa-0290/
[root@debian-f5ibh] ~ # cat /proc/sys/dev/sensors/chips
256     w83781d-isa-0290
[root@debian-f5ibh] ~ # ls /proc/sys/dev/sensors/w83781d-isa-0290/
alarms  beep  fan1  fan2  fan3  fan_div  in0  in1  in2  in3  in4  in5  in6  rt1
rt2  rt3  temp1  temp2  temp3  vid
