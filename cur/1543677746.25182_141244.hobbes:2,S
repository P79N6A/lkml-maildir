           Summary: uptime wrong on x86-64
    Kernel Version: 2.5.72
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: johnstul@us.ibm.com
         Submitter: johnstul@us.ibm.com
Distribution: SLES8  
Hardware Environment: AMD64 Melody box  
Software Environment: 2.5.72  
Problem Description:   
uptime reports wrong value after booting  
Steps to reproduce:  
jstultz@elm3b31:~/linux-2.5> uptime  
Actual result:  
  1:19pm  up 12220 days, 20:19,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00  
Expected result:  
  1:19pm  up 15 min,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.02  
Additional info:  
jstultz@elm3b31:~/linux-2.5> date +%s  
1055881186  
jstultz@elm3b31:~/linux-2.5> cat /proc/stat | grep btime  
btime 1055880294  
  
I've been unable to reproduce the problem on i386, however this has also been  
reported against sparc64 by Daniel Whitener.    
  
I suspect it might have something to do w/ do_posix_clock_monotonic_gettime() on  
these arches.
