Hello all!
This morning I went to a work-interview. Unfortunately, in that company
they use WinNT. But, well, they had a good opinion about linux, blah,
blah, blah...
But the director says me that linux doesn't implement threads, is this
true?. He said that threads in linux are implemented by a library, not at
kernel-level.
If you can give me more info, please let me know.
Thanks in advance,
	Carlos.
