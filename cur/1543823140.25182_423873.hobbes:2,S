Hi,
I use NFS to read a remote directory, which contains 56 entries. But
after the read, "ls -al" only show 26, 31, or 51 entries in three test
runs.
I have read the NFS  code "encode_entry" and related "nfs_readdir",
"nfs3_proc_readdir"..., but haven't find the right place that can
cause this problem.
Is there anyone has similar experience? Please help!
Thanks,
-x
