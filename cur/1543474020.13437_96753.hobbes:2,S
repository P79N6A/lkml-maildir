hi there,
    I have a WD32500H 2.5gig drive.. it was bought in '95 or '96 .. and
it DOES NOT SUPPORT UDMA.   The specs on www.wdc.com have NO mention of
UDMA.  It does PIO Mode 4 and that's it.  Yet it is blacklisted for UDMA
in the 2.2.0 pre kernels right up to pre4-ac1 ..  if i am wrong can
someone correct me or can it be removed from the blacklist please? :)
Phil
