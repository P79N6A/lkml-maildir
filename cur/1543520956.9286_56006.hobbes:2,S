Hello there,
patch-2.2.14 'breaks' reception of plip packets. Destination MAC
address checking (unicast/broadcast et al.) has been tightened up in
2.2.14, and the plip driver doesn't set the h_dest addr of received
packets to its own dev->dev_addr. Which causes eth_type_trans to mark
each incoming packet as an OTHERHOST packet. Et cetera.
Fix included.
Greetings,
Lennert Buytenhek
