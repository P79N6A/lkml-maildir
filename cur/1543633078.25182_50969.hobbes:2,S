Ugh I think you are right.  This is an incredibly small race, though!

I agree here, too.
Fyi, schedule_tail is called from assembly code on SMP machines.  See
entry.S
rq->frozen is admittedly a bit confusing.  Dave Miller added it - on
some architectures mm->page_table_lock is grabbed during switch_mm(). 
Additionally, swap_out() and others grab page_table_lock during wakeups
which also grab rq->lock.  Bad locking... Dave's solution was to make
another lock, the "frozen state lock", which is held around context
switches.  This way we can protect the "not switched out yet" task
without grabbing the whole runqueue lock.
Anyhow, with this issue, I guess we need to fix it... I'll send a patch
to Linus.
