Great to know it works. I will test it when get access to the machine
after the weekend.

There is a good point in the thread, that hotplug should not call
recursion, but while this may be very valid requirement, it is _very_
subtle, and something more solid should be done. Just an opinion.
Initialization reordering is likely also not what we want, but simple
dumb console (or just dummy device which will accept data and will be
replaced later) sounds like a way to go, and your patch seems to allow
that dumb class registration first.
I actually used to believe that it works that way already...
