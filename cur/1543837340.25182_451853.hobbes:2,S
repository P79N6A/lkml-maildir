Subject: [PATCH] sys_getppid-oopses-on-debug-kernel-v2-simplify
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/9/212

On top of Kirill's sys_getppid-oopses-on-debug-kernel-v2.patch
- We don't need ->group_leader->real_parent, all threads should
  have the same ->real_parent.
- We don't need tasklist_lock, task_struct is freed by RCU, so
  rcu_read_lock() should be enough.
(Compile tested)

 /*
- * Accessing ->group_leader->real_parent is not SMP-safe, it could
- * change from under us. However, rather than getting any lock
- * we can use an optimistic algorithm: get the parent
- * pid, and go back and check that the parent is still
- * the same. If it has changed (which is extremely unlikely
- * indeed), we just try again..
- *
- * NOTE! This depends on the fact that even if we _do_
- * get an old value of "parent", we can happily dereference
- * the pointer (it was and remains a dereferencable kernel pointer
- * no matter what): we just can't necessarily trust the result
- * until we know that the parent pointer is valid.
- *
- * NOTE2: ->group_leader never changes from under us.
+ * Accessing ->real_parent is not SMP-safe, it could
+ * change from under us. However, we can use a stale
+ * value of ->real_parent under rcu_read_lock(), see
+ * release_task()->call_rcu(delayed_put_task_struct).
