If invalidate_inode_pages2_range() will return EIOCBRETRY as the patch 
"aio: fix kernel bug when page is temporally busy"
serts then do_sync_read/write() will not drop IO submit but will retry
it:
        for (;;) {
                ret = filp->f_op->aio_read(&kiocb, &iov, 1,
kiocb.ki_pos);
                if (ret != -EIOCBRETRY)
                        break;
                wait_on_retry_sync_kiocb(&kiocb);
        }
And do_sync_read/write() will not return EIO if page is busy as it does
now, befor patching.
Curretly do_sync_read/write() tests for EIOCBRETRY. But EIOCBRETRY is
not set ever.
