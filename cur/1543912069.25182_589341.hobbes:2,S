Subject: PATCH? fix SIGNAL_STOP_DEQUEUED vs SIGCONT race
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Two threads, T1 and T2, SIGTTIN is SIG_DFL, SIGTTOU has a handler.
	T1 does get_signal_to_deliver(), dequeus SIGTTIN, unlocks ->siglock.
	SIGCONT comes in, nothing to do yet, just clear SIGNAL_STOP_DEQUEUED.
	SIGTTOU is sent, T2 dequeues it and sets SIGNAL_STOP_DEQUEUED again.
	It has a handler, we shouldn't stop, but
	T1 continues, takes ->siglock, and calls do_signal_stop().
Move the setting of SIGNAL_STOP_DEQUEUED from dequeue_signal() to
get_signal_to_deliver(), and set this flag only if we are really going to stop.
This also simplifies the code and makes the SIGNAL_STOP_DEQUEUED usage more
understandable.
However, this changes the behaviour when the task is ptraced. If the debugger
doesn't clear ->exit_code, SIGSTOP always succeeds after ptrace_stop(), even
if SIGCONT was sent in between. I can't decide whether this change is good
or bad, hopefully Roland can clarify.
