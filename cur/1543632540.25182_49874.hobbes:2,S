Hey, I even cc'ed you on the patch when it went to Linus... Lets look at
what happened before: run tq_disk, then check if it is active. What
prevents tq_disk from being active right after you issue the TQ_ACTIVE
check? Nothing. And I'm not sure exactly what semantics you think
running tq_disk has. I suspect you are looking for a 'start any pending
i/o and return when it has completed', which is far from what happens.
Running tq_disk will _try_ to start _some_ I/O, and eventually, in time,
the currently pending requests will have completed. In the mean time,
more I/O could have been added though.
