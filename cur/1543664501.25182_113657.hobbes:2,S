Hmmm... windows seems to have a workaround for at least part of the
problem, I spent the last day trying to confuse the APIC unsuccessfully
on that system.  Could it be a problem with the uhci driver perhaps?
The only two persistant symptoms are the usb failure and the slew of 
messages.
The APIC errors I receive are mostly 02(02) but a good deal of
02(01), 01(02) and 01(01).  Checksum errors galore.
This only happens with IO-APIC is enabled throughout:
hub.c: new USB device 00:11.2-1, assigned address 2
usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout
usb.c: USB device not accepting new address=2 (error=-110)
hub.c: new USB device 00:11.2-1, assigned address 3
b.c: USB device not accepting new address=3 (error=-110)
hub.c: new USB device 00:11.2-2, assigned address 4
usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout
usb.c: USB device not accepting new address=4 (error=-110)
hub.c: new USB device 00:11.2-2, assigned address 5
usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout
usb.c: USB device not accepting new address=5 (error=-110)
