Hehe, yeah, that might work.

This and all other bit fields are now just u32s that I access by shifting and 
masking.

This struct is filled in using fw_memcpy_from_be32() to copy and byteswap the 
incoming payload, so the fields here are always cpu endian.  The two u16 
fields assume little endian ordering though, I fixed that.

Oops, fixed.

Possibly, I don't have firewire multi-LUN devices to test with here.  The LUNs 
are also discoverable from the firewire config rom, which is why I put the 
comment there.  This doesn't mean that the SCSI commands for discovering LUNs 
doesn't also work.

I copied it over from the old stack under the assumption that it fixed 
something for some device.  I took it out and tested with the 10 or so storage 
devices I have here and it makes no difference.  I've never seen the 
fw_notify() that I put in there trigger.  I'm taking out this workaround for 
now, unless someone can tell me why it should stay there.
