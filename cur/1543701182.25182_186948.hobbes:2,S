Using generic I2O driver is definitely an option for now especially for 
those who wants to immediately jump onto the 2.6 bandwagon. However the 
down site with this is we can't use an of the available Management 
utilities for the card.
Now which is better is not for me to comment on. I shall leave it to others 
to decide for their own as to which is suitable for their environment.

I can now officially report that the dpt_i2o driver embedded in kernel 
2.6.0 is broken. I'll highlight and bring this up through my contacts back 
at Adaptec. And hopefully we than can get some kind of official resolution 
soon.
