I know about lirc project, and I'd like to see it merged, but if lirc
uses wrong interface, it is unsuitable for the kernel.
Motivation for having same code for infrared controls and normal
keyboards: normal keyboards tend to have "play"/"stop"/"vol+"/"vol-"
keys these days; certainly HP omnibook xe3 has them. It would be nice
to handle them in an uniform way.
