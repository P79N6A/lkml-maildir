Presumably a cluster exists to do more work than can be done on a single
machine. So a single cheap low power modern system will probably use a
lot less power to do equal work. Perhaps MHz was a poor choice, but we
don't really have a good single term for an arbitrary unit of computing
(AUC?) which is what I really meant there. At some point a cluster of
old slow machines doesn't scale financially, even if they are free.
Admin and repair tend to scale with units, networking is needed which
drives up the cost, even if time is free it's still finite.

If same task means the same number of AUC, say web pages served,
probably you could find that somewhere. Or measure a 486, a P4 and a C3
compiling a kernel. If the 486 takes about 80 minutes (from memory
that's close), and a P4-2.6 takes about 8 minutes, then if the P4 takes
less than ten times the power of the 486 it would be more efficient in
terms of computations per watt. I have never compiled a kernel on the
C3, but I suspect it is at least 5x the 486 and takes much less power.
