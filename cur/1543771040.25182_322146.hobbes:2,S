I -completely- misinterpreted

on first reading some months ago.  It looks much more interesting
on second reading.  It does not have the degree of isolation that
the pure double-kernel approaches do, since as the paper states,
Linux can "hide" tasks that are waking up from I/O events.
However, it does appear to provide a unified user-level environment.
I will add it to my list of approaches to realtime in Linux!
