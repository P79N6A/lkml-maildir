You forgot -N option of diff :
Only in v2.4.13-ac8+tr.4/include/linux: per_cpu.h
Testing on my SMP box would be a bit awkward (not set up ppp/serial, so would have
to transfer patches from 2.4.5 by floppy ;) but if you need an SMP test done,
just shout.
On the UP box, the previous patch has now survived several hours under very heavy
NMI load, so I assume it's good.
thanks
