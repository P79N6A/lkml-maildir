Not the case. Yesterday, I even replaced the 40 wire cable, in use for 
the DVD device, with a 80 wire one.

Yes, this was the case. I plugged the drive on the end now, but the 
drive, which was plugged into the middle of the cable, wasn't the one, 
which errors, it was the DVD device (hdc).

Not the case.

... don't know about how to find and remove such problems...
I still have those messages, but now there seem to be much less of them.
It would really help me, if someone could tell me about how critical 
such error messages are.
Is this a common problem of IDE connections? May I just ignore those 
messages, if I tried anything to get rid of them, or do they tell me 
"get a new hardware, the old one will fail, soon"? Will my data be 
read/written without mistakes, even with those errors?
Its interesting, that I only get those messages using the Slackware 
install CD, which has many kernel modules built into the kernel.
With the "slimmed down" kernel of slackware, which even needs an initrd 
for ext2 root devices, I don't get this errors, so currently I only get 
them while installing and not while my daily work on my system...
Maybe I'll install the "huge" kernel, with the many "built in" stuff, 
onto my regular Slackware install, tomorrow, to see if this will cause 
those errors.
Thank you *very* much for any help and information!
Yours
Manuel
