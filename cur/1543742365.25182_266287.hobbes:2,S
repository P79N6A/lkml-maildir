Makefiles are valid input files to make, and the kbuild files has
for a long time had their own documented syntax.
Introduce the Kbuild name just makes this even more apperant for the reader.
When we in two years time start to deal with external modules that only support
kernel 2.6.10 and never then we can avoid the ugly:
ifeq ($(KERNELRELEASE),)
...
To separate out the real makefile and the Kbuild stuff.

I'm in favour of this too - but so far Roman has rejected it.
But this still leaves out the other parts where the Kbuild name makes
more sense.
PArt of the longer term plaaning is a split of
arch/$(ARCH)/Makefile in a Kbuild.define and Kbuild.rules part.
This split will allows the kbuild infrastructure to be used
also for the top-level part of the kernel - and the next generation
kbuild will read in all relevant Kbuild files and create a single
Makfilefile for that part of the kernel compilation.
This is part of the vision at least - introducing kbuild
contant in Kconfig files is not a hindering for this.
