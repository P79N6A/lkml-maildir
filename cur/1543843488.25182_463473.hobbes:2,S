I agree that if locks really represent different objects with different
locking semantics they should not share the class. Lockdep provides a
mechanism for that; however I'm very afraid that for the input layer,
they really are not that, they are not different objects with different
semantics; they are the same objects with nesting semantics! In that
case the "separate lock class" stuff has only disadvantages.
The worst thing is that as I understand it this separate class is
*dynamic*. Eg it's not even "one class per driver" ;(
