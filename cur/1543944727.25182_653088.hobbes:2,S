The version with problems is the one dated by Jan, 16:
http://linuxtv.org/pipermail/v4l-dvb-maintainer/2008-January/006119.html
As Ricardo stated on Feb, 5, he fixed the lock issues, that were present on
your first revision:
http://linuxtv.org/pipermail/v4l-dvb-maintainer/2008-February/006292.html
I've pushed the reviewed version at the same day, for testing, at the
development environment:
http://linuxtv.org/pipermail/v4l-dvb-maintainer/2008-February/006326.html
Nobody pointed any newer issues on the reviewed version, since then.
If you still see any issues, please send us a patch fixing it.
