Great! Thanks for your support. 
After futzing around for all that time I've become sure that an approach 
without an interactive estimator is our only way forward. So far the 
throughput benchmarks are encouraging too so I suspect the estimator may be 
causing harm there too.
Ensuring the different arches and cpuidle work properly I likely will need 
help with, though, so I'd appreciate any help from people if they see 
something obvious and can get a grip of my code.
Thanks!
