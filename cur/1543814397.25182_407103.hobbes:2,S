It does?
Is it any good?
bix:/home/akpm> cat t.c
void foo()
{
	_Bool b = 1;
	b += 2;
}
bix:/home/akpm> gcc -O -Wall -c t.c

Sigh.

That'd be a separate patch ;)

We have a couple of private bools and a couple of private 'true's and
`false's so I guess it'd be a simple patch.  I wonder if it would have any
surprising side-effects.
(I think using `bool' is a good thing - it makes the code more readable.
It's a shame the compiler's handling of it is so useless).
