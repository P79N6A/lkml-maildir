Wouldn't it be easier to just ljmp to the start address of the kernel in memory
(the address after the bootloader has done its thing), effectively restarting
the kernel from line 1? Or is tehre an issue with some hardware being in an
invalid state when doing this?
Maybe Eric Biederman can comment on this since he's adding new functionality to
the boot loader..
