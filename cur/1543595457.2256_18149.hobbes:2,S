I use the hack myself, to implement a record-oriented file where the 
file position is a record number. I could probably live with 
PAGE_SIZE, but the current hack works fine with start bigger than 
that, and it's possible that someone counts on it.
But if you're allocating your own buffer, you'd probably be better 
off writing your own file ops, and not using the default 
proc_file_read() at all. At the very least you'd save a redundant 
__get_free_page/free_page pair.
