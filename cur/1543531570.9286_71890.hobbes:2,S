Subject: Max File descriptors in Linux 2.2.14

This is probably a FAQ, I have searched everywhere I can think of though.
By default, Linux 2.2.14 has the max file descriptors hard coded to
1024.  I know that there are about half a dozen files that need to be
modified and changes need to be made in /proc at boot.  The docs I had to
do this blew up along with the rest of the data in a nice hdd crash.
If anyone knows how to do this (I know there is a patch, but it's 2.2.9
only) please let me know.  And I'll put a web site up on how to do it :-)
Please cc me in replies as I'm not a subscriber.
Thanks,
Chris
