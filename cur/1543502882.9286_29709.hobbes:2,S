 I too would like to see support for threads improved in the Linux
kernel.
The problem I'm having with Linux threads is that they don't easily
allow
me to write a run-time system for a heavily multi-threaded language such 
as Java.
The way it is right now, you have two choices:
+ either use linux-threads, in which case you benefit from SMP and
kernel-enforced
  quotas and nice scheduling, but you run into serious resource problems 
  (ever tried to run an application such as VolanoBench under
Blackdown's 
  JDK1.1.7 native port?).  This is probably because every linux threads
takes 
  up an entry in the process table and has other system-wide resources
associated 
  with it.
+ or write your own user-level thread package, in which case you have to
deal
  with the complexities of signals, async I/O, etc.  and, more
importantly,
  you cannot easily take advantage of an SMP machine.
What I'm looking for, and this is rather vague, is some kernel support
that
allows me to write an SMP-capable user-level threading package.  This
could
be as simple as Solaris's SIGLWP, but it may require more.  I don't
know.
Has anybody thought along these lines?
