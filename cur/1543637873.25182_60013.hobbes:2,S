That helps on the output side, sure, but I (mis?)understood the question
to be about the ability to do Alt-SysRq-x via ssh.  Is that possible?
Not that I know of, but I could be wrong about that.
So if you really need Alt-SysRq over a network connection (or even
a serial console connection)...
A few months ago I cooked up a patch so that "echo {magickey}"
mimics SysRq via proc/sysctl.  Patch against 2.4.18 is here:
  
http://www.osdl.org/archive/rddunlap/patches/sys-magic.dif
Usage is:  echo {key} > /proc/sys/kernel/magickey
