Oh certainly.  That's why we have a VFS :)  fsync for NFS will look 
quite different, too.

Yep.  That would immediately cover a bunch of filesystems.

My own idea is that we create a FLUSH command for blkdev request queues, 
to exist alongside READ, WRITE, and the current barrier implementation. 
  Then FLUSH could be passed down through MD or DM.
