If I want I can have 16 threads executing code in a shared object being
written to by ten other programs at once and shared over a network while
we are at it. Its probably not a good idea but I can do it if I have
reason to.
Unix and Linux likewise take the basic view that locking is a problem for
the user, while file permissions prevent it being made a problem for
other users.
