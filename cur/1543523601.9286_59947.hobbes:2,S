Hi,
I actually sent a mail about this some time ago, but i dont think many 
got it because of some troubles with my MUA...
When I use cfs with any 2.3 kernel (the latest i tested is 2.3.40) and 
run "ls" in a dir within the crypted area with a couple of hundred 
files it just hangs. It works fine in 2.2.x.
Here is the strace (altough i dont think i'll help so much):
..
open(".", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK|O_DIRECTORY) = 3
fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=129024, ...}) = 0
fcntl(3, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC)           = 0
brk(0x805b000)                          = 0x805b000
getdents(3,  <unfinished ...>    <-- It hangs here.
I suspect that it's a problem in the nfs code because cfs runs
over nfs. What could the problem be? I'm willing to test any patch
that may solve it.
If there's something else that has to be known just tell me so.
