IP autoconfiguration is not done after we use an initrd, only before.
This means, for example, that anyone who uses IP autoconfiguration with a
modularized Ethernet driver will not have much luck.
Would it be possible to add a second call to ip_auto_config to see if 
IP can be configured after the initrd is unmounted?
I tried patching the call into change_root, but it gave me a kernel
panic when I tried... :(
Right now ip_auto_config is only done once, during device_setup or 
net_dev_init().
Maybe if we could compile ip autoconfiguration in as a module as well,
life would be easier, no?  Then we could just sort of force things
to work.
