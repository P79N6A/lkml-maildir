Hi,
I have a dual PIII machine with 1.25 GB of RAM, and I have just
installed a 2.4.19-pre9-ac3 kernel. (I also have ALSA CVS and lm
sensors 2.6.3 installed.)
Anyway, I decided to compile in the PNPBIOS feature and discovered
that:
# cat /proc/bus/pnp/escd
is a synonym for "cold reboot". Now I understand that *writing* to
random /proc files is a Bad Thing, but reading them??? I would have
thought that the worst I could have done would have been corrupting my
termininal. Is the escd file my actual ESCD area?
Is this a bug, or just a case of "don't do that!"?
Cheers,
Chris
