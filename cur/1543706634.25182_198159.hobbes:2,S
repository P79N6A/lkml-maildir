JFS definitely ran into some corrupt metadata.  It could either be
corrupt on disk, or a memory-corruption problem.  I don't know if
hardware is the cause, but you say that nothing indicates that.  If it
is caused by a software bug, it would be hard to track down unless it is
repeatable.  The BUG() itself should probably be replaced by something
nicer, like the first two errors reported by dbFree.
At this point the superblock should be marked dirty, so fsck should
attempt to repair the damage upon reboot.  I'd like to know if you
continue to see problems.
Thanks,
Shaggy
