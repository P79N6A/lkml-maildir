How different is that to raid1/5/6 being set to a 'paranoid' "read-verify" mode 
(as per Dan's recent email) where a read reads from _all_ spindles and verifies 
(and with R6 maybe corrects) the stripe before returning it?
Doesn't solve DaveC's issue about the fs doing redundancy but isn't that 
essentially just fs level mirroring?
