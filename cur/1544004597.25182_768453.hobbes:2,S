My previous analysis was bogus, let's start from scratch:
1) the initial oops report:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11796#c0
- lockdep is enabled, the oops is somewhere in __lock_acquire
- the instruction that oopses is
 >>>  lock incl 0x138(%r12)
R12 is 0x0038004000000000
That could be an debug_atomic_inc() in __lock_acquire. The class pointer 
in the spinlock_t is not initialized, thus it crashes.
Ingo - is that possible?
2) the latest oops was actually a soft lockup:
It starts with:

For me, it reads like an uninitialized spinlock_t:
The static_obj test in kernel/lockdep.c notices that something is wrong and disables itself.
But then _raw_spin_lock() tries to acquire the uninitialized spinlock and loops forever, because noone does spin_unlock().
after 60 seconds, the soft lockup detection notices the problem and oopses.
