	You are able to unlink a file that is opened and used by yourself
	or another process.
	You are able to rmdir your current directory by typing
	rmdir `pwd`. So I do not see why we should take care of the
	name of the directory to reject the deletion (`pwd` versus '.').
	And yes, the 2.0.xx kernels returned an 'Operation not permitted'
	on 'rmdir .' and the only serious reason to revert to that test
	is to maintain compatibility.
