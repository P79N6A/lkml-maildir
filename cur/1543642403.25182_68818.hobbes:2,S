same problem I was having with 2.4.20-pre4-ac2-preempt.
alan didn't want to hear it from me due to the -preempt
my system was e7500 chipset, dual xeon, WD 40g drive, ext2 or ext3.
from this we can glean: preempt not a factor, HD manufacturer not a factor, 
FS not a factor.  don't know what chipset you are using.
I was allso geting badCRC errors.
