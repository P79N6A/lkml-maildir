It would be a bug in the caller, this is a primitive really. If the caller 
is calling this with random bitmasks they are probably making errors 
elsewhere too. This is also the behaviour of the Alpha version, which has 
been around before this patch.

The following cpu_online call only goes as far as avoiding IPI'ing to 
nonexistent cpus, anything more would be spoonfeeding the caller, i prefer 
garbage in, garbage out.
	for (i = 0; i < NR_CPUS; i++) {
		if (cpu_online(i) && ((1UL << i) & mask))
			smp_ext_bitcall(i, ec_call_function);
	}
