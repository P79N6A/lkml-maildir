That's obviously true since we're defining __attribute_unused__ to be 
__attribute__((unused)).
We were trying to clean up the misconception that the current 
__attribute_used__ was created to suppress warnings when, in fact, that 
was not its purpose.  It was created to emit the code for a function that 
appeared to be unreferenced and only suppressed warnings as a side-effect 
in gcc <3.4.

That would be the current definition of __attribute_used__ (i.e. we're 
saying that we use the function in inline assembly even though it appears 
we don't use it at all).

That would be the patched definition of __attribute_unused__.
So let's go back to the problem this was initially supposed to fix from 
arch/i386/pci/init.c:
static __init int pci_access_init(void)
{
	int type = 0;
#ifdef CONFIG_PCI_DIRECT
	type = pci_direct_probe();
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_PCI_MMCONFIG
	pci_mmcfg_init(type);
#endif
	...
and type is unreferenced for the remainder of the function.  Obviously we 
could add #if defined(CONFIG_PCI_DIRECT) || defined(CONFIG_PCI_MMCONFIG) 
before the declaration of 'type', but that becomes sloppy pretty quickly.
The patched version makes this:
	int type __attribute_unused__ = 0;
which definitely tells you that you're using a compiler attribute that 
will be attached to that automatic.  In your case:
	int type __unneeded = 0;
doesn't say anything in this case.  It doesn't resemble any attribute that 
a programmer might be familiar with and begs the question of why we've 
declared it if it's truly "unneeded"?
By the way, there are tons of these instances where __attribute__((used)) 
needs to be added in driver code to suppress unreferenced warnings.
