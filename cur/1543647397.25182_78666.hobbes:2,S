Larry, 
Why do you "give away" BK for single-user use? That's to make 
people familiar with the product so that they will know about it 
when they DO need it in the case that they end up in a situation 
where it does make sense. right?
Now you're saying that you don't want the market of 2-10 developers:
the other version control systems don't hurt enough. 
Would it make sense to allow these people to use BK for free under
these circumstances, so that WHEN they grow, they are already
using BK, and know exactly how to use it?
My company with 2 developers will survive on tar&diff if you want 
money for BK from us. We might decide that "tar&diff" still works
when we cross the 25 developer line..... You might want us to be 
using BK by that time.
