Yes, herein lies one of those mysteries that still eludes me but I have been 
investigating it. I can now reproduce in other applications what appears to 
be the problem - Two cpu hogs, X and evolution for example are running and 
evolution is making X the cpu hog. The problem is that X gets demoted whereas 
evolution doesn't. Strangely, dropping evolution to nice +1 or making X -1 
seems to change which one gets demoted, and X is now much smoother. I assume 
the same thing is happening here between wine and wineserver, which is why 
you've seen reversal of priorities in your previous posts. See if renicing 
one of them +1 helps for the time being. I will continue investigating to 
find out why the heck this happens and try and fix it.

P.S. I've cc'ed MG because he has seen the scheduler do other forms of 
trickery and may have thoughts on why this happens.
