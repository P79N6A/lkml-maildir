To be pedantic, the Return-path: header contains the envelope
sender address (the argument of the "MAIL FROM:" SMTP command)
and is inserted by a receiving MTA for informational purposes on
final delivery, not by an originating mailer.  Bounces are
supposed to go to the envelope sender -- but that doesn't mean an
MTA is supposed to use the Return-path; header to get that
address.
