Hello,
From reading linux/Documentation/mtrr.txt and from recent posts on
linux-kernel I see that there should be several entries in the MTRR.
I've got an Intel Pentium III with a Nvidia Corporation Riva TNT AGP
graphics card.  It's a Dell Dimension XPS-T550.
The MTRR file after boot reads:
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size= 128MB: write-back, count=1
If I've read recent posts correctly there should also be an entry to
make the video writes be combined, correct?  It seems that my card has
Region 0 and Region 1, I suppose graphic and texture areas (see
below).  Which should I use?  Both?
Should it be (I don't believe this is correct):
echo "base=0xf5000000 size=0x1625600 type=write-combining" >! /proc/mtrr
Also recently there was a post about excluding caching from I/O and
non-used areas.  How are these determined?
From XFree86 Version 3.3.3.1 SVGA logs:
(--) SVGA: PCI: NVidia Riva TNT rev 4, Memory @ 0xf5000000, 0xfc000000
(--) SVGA: chipset:  RIVATNT
(--) SVGA: videoram: 16256k
My lspci -vvvv on the the video device reads:
