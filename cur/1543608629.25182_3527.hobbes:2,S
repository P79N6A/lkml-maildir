samba@samba.org, but if the kernel crashes smbd is probably not the guilty
party (it does run as root, or start as root, but I don't think it does
anything clever like write to /dev/kmem ... mmap possibly).
Nor do I think the samba developers are interested in crashing linux
kernels with experimental patches (more or less experimental anyway :)

Normally that requires a 'character set' setting to get it right on the
linux side as well. But perhaps it guesses the right one ...
