Since we have a fixed number of irq consumers, it's much simpler doing
chained interrupts this way. Using an irq_chip is going to introduce
unnecessary complezity, I feel.
The V2, of the series (about to be sent) changes how irq managemt
is done - pcf50633_request_irq and pcf50633_free_irq are used.
Thank you for the review.
Will send a new version soon.
