Could you make that a ktime_t (or struct ktime)?
There are machines, which sleep more than they are awake. 
Just imagine a surveillance camera triggered by door entrance.
Yes, these things might run Linux (e.g. on "cris" architecture).
Or your VCR.
Yes, these devices might sleep more than they are awake, 
if you are not a TV junkie :-)
