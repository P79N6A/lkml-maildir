Is there anything fundamentally wrong with invoking the test script from 
within the module makefile, when really necessary? This doesn't work very 
well if you need the test results outside of the module build.
	----- Makefile -----
	test_result := $(shell ...)
	ifneq ($(test_result),)
	EXTRA_CFLAGS := -DSOMETHING
	endif
	...
