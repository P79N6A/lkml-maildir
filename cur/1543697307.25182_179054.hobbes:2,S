Hello all,
version 0.18 of forcedeth for Linux 2.4 and 2.6 is available at
http://www.hailfinger.org/carldani/linux/patches/forcedeth/
It is also integrated in 2.6.0-test9-mm4.
Fixes in this release over 0.17:
*  Avoid Oops on rmmod.
Known issues:
*  Some boards give bogus MAC addresses and work only partially.
   Same problem happens with nvnet on these boards.
*  Possible system slowdown during periods of extreme network
   load, fix is currently being tested.
Please test.
Regards,
Carl-Daniel
