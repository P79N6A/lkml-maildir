This is not good. If you change your kernel, you would have to
recompile your applications as well. The ioctl() command value
needs to be a constant that doesn't change when kernel headers
change.

Ioctls() contain a unique file-descriptor that means it's for your
device only, not something "system wide". I noticed some bugs with
some kernel version where all ioctls seemed to be treated the same
like a function meant for my device could actually do something
to a terminal. If this still exists, it's a bug. I don't know
if these bugs still exist.

Well ellegant isn't necessarily better, just different. The writers
of sysfs want you to use their interface, the writers of xxxfs
want you to use their interface,... etc. Ioctls are forever.
They will exist as long as there is a kernel. Even network
manipulating things like ethtool, ifconfig, and route use
ioctls.
