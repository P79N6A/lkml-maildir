With priority there are two values.  One that can be set from userspace (the
nice value), and one that is purely kept in the kernel (the priority value).
The interactivity estimating changes the priority value based on heuristics.
The nice value (by default zero), determines the range of priorities the
kernel will give to a task (based on its "interactivity rating").  And it is
this relativly static nice value that determines the time slice size also.
