It can only free the pages on the quicklist after the flush. So it needs 
to set need_flush to trigger the flush before check_pgt_cache can trim the 
quicklist. If need_flush is not set then pages are freed in 
check_pgt_cache before their TLBs have been flushed.

Yup as we agreed before it would be best to make the TLB pieces part of 
the native mmu gather infrastructure. But then they vary quite a lot 
between arches.
