Does hardware interrupt mitigation really interact well with NAPI? In my 
experience, holding off interrupts for X packets or Y usecs does more 
harm than good; such hardware features are useful only when the OS has 
no NAPI-like mechanism.
When tuning NAPI drivers for packets/sec performance (which is a good 
indicator of driver performance), I make sure that the driver stays in 
NAPI polled mode while it has any rx or tx work to do. If the CPU is 
fast enough that all work is always completed on each poll, I have the 
driver stay in polled mode until dev->poll() is called N times with no 
work being done. This keeps interrupts disabled for reasonable traffic 
levels, while minimizing packet processing latency. No need for hardware 
interrupt mitigation.

I agree. It would be nice to find a way for the typical user to derive 
best values for these knobs for his/her particular system. Perhaps a 
tool using pktgen and network device phy internal loopback could be 
developed?
