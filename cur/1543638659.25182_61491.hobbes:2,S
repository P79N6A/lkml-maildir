I would really prefer to avoid this, and get "95% coloring" by just doing 
read-ahead with higher-order allocations instead of the current "loop 
allocation of one block".
I bet that you will get _practically_ perfect coloring with just two small 
changes:
 - do_anonymous_page() looks to see if the page tables are empty around 
   the faulting address (and check vma ranges too, of course), and 
   optimistically does a non-blocking order-X allocation.
   If the order-X allocation fails, we're likely low on memory (this is 
   _especially_ true since the very fact that we do lots of order-X
   allocations will probably actually help keep fragementation down
   normally), and we just allocate one page (with a regular GFP_USER this 
   time).
   Map in all pages.
 - do the same for page_cache_readahead() (this, btw, is where radix trees 
   will kick some serious ass - we'd have had a hard time doing the "is
   this range of order-X pages populated" efficiently with the old hashes.
I bet just those fairly small changes will give you effective coloring, 
_and_ they are also what you want for doing small superpages.
And no, I do not want separate coloring support in the allocator. I think 
coloring without superpage support is stupid and worthless (and 
complicates the code for no good reason).
