Yes, cvs is poor at that.  This is a bugfix, not a feature request :)

Yes.  changesets against a *group* of files (ie: a patch) needs
to become a first-class citizen.

Current tkdiff is in fact very good at this.  So integration
with that may suit.
The problem I find is that I often want to take (file1+patch) -> file2,
when I don't have file1.  But merge tools want to take (file1|file2) -> file3.
I haven't seen a graphical tool which helps you to wiggle a patch into
a file.

These can probably be in version 2...
Probably the requirements of general developers differ from those
of tree-owners.  The general developer is always working against
the official tree.
This is a bit extreme perhaps but I'm currently working code which
consists of twelve changesets against 100 files.  Many of those
files are changed by multiple changesets.  So two things:
1: If I have two changesets applied to a file, and I make a change to
   that file, which changeset is it to be associated with?
2: The ability to move a set of changes from one changeset into
   another one.  ie: split that damn patch up!
But as a starting point I'd say: changesets as a first-class-concept,
and lots of integration with tkdiff.
