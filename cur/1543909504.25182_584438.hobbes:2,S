Yes calling cache_free_alien is not necessary if you just have a single 
node. All memory is node local in that case.
I do not think that cache_free_alien is confusing since the name refers to 
the function freeing an alien object. That alien object can be freed to an 
alien cache or directly to a remote slab.
