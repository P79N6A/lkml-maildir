	Solaris, which does forcedirectio as a mount option, actually
will do buffered I/O on the trailing part.  Consider it like a bounce
buffer.  That way they don't DMA the trailing data and succeed the I/O.
The I/O returns actual bytes till EOF, just like read(2) is supposed to.
	Either this or a fully DMA'd number 4 is really what we should
do.  If security can only be solved via a bounce buffer, who cares?  If
the user created themselves a non-aligned file to open O_DIRECT, that's
their problem if the last part-sector is negligably slower.
