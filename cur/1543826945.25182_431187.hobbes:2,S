the core duo is a pentium-m (well, a pair of p-m).  it's just a branding 
change at this point (an annoying brand name too)... future "core2" have a 
different microarchitecture but i'd still choose pentium-m for early 
kernels on those too... until someone finds some reason to differentiate 
core2.
you can see it's even the same family as pentium-m... see 
<

 and search for "Intel P6-core" to see 
all the related models in family 6.
