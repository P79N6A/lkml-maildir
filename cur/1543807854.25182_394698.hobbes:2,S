Ok. So Lee might be ok to test uswsusp. But this is your approach
regardless of who is emailing you. You consistently tell people to fix
problems themselves and send you a patch. That's not what a maintainer
should do. They're supposed to maintain, not get other people to do the
work. They're supposed to be helpful, not a source of anxiety. You might be
the maintainer of swsusp in name, but you're not in practice. Please, lift
your game!
