Hmmm ...... It has worked with 2.4.20 ..... but I just went
through many hardware and software updates and replacements and I
can't (hardware replaced) go back and verify everything ... so I can't
really give you a reliable answer here.
I can try to install everything again in a way that will make it fail
with 2.4.22 and then download and install older versions until it
works again, but that will be a tedious process that will take
many hours of work. Maybe, but only maybe, I'll do it, but only
if you find it VERY useful.
Kind regards
