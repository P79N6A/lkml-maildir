Ok, fair enough. But maybe a comment needs to be added to the get_cycles
to notify folks of the issues that surround it on systems without a
synced TSC?

Actually, we can't do this, because if interrupts are being blocked
jiffies won't change. That is why I'm trying to provide hardware clock
access to hangcheck. It just so happened it was using get_cycles() as an
interface and it seemed appropriate for moving to timer_ops.

Ok, so you're telling me to use another interface. I'm down with that
(sometimes I just need it spelled out). Name suggestions? 
read_hw_timer?
thanks
