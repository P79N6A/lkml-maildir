Yep.

I think so, due to lack of time I'm not following libata discussions closely.

I was thinking about using ->mode_filter but since all other PATA host
drivers are doing PIO filtering in ->set_piomode methods and also since it
seemed that using ->mode_filter method would result in slightly more complex
code I opted for coherency / simplicity.  However if you (or somebody else)
want to make a follow-up change to this driver (and preferably other PATA
host drivers ie. pata_sil680) to use ->mode_filter I'm also fine with that.
Thanks,
Bart
