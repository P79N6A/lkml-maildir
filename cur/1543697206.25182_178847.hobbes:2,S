Good call! I was mis-adding in conversion to nanoseconds. The patch
below should fix it (Andrew, feel free to ignore this, I'll sync up all
the acpi-pm changes with you later). 
Although I'm finding that the sched_clock->monotonic_clock patch doesn't
look like a win. With that patch sched_clock takes ~400-700 cycles using
clock=pmtmr. With your "fix-sched_clock.diff" patch its less then 40
cycles. 
While better accuracy is nice, I can't imagine the 10-20x cost of
sched_clock is worth it. So I think your fix is the best solution.
thanks
