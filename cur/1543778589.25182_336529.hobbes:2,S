Perfectly understood.  I've had two customers ask me to increase the
priorities for them, but those where custom kernels, and a config option
wasn't necessary. But since I've had customers asking, I thought that
this might be something that others want.  But I deal with a niche
market, and what my customers want might not be what everyone wants.
(hence the RFC in the subject).
So if there are others out there that would prefer to change their
priority ranges,  speak now otherwise this patch will go by the waste
side.
