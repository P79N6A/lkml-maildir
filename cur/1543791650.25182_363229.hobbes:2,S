PowerMac 8500 is an old fragile beast. Especially with a G3 processor
hooked on it. The venerable Apple Bandit PCI bridge can have some
"issues" every now and then with trivial things like ... cache coherency
(ugh !). It tends to hit things like USB pretty badly. I can't guarantee
for sure that's the cause of your problem, but it's possible...
