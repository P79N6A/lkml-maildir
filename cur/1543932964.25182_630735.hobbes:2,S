Sure, I realize this, but it solves the problem in one way for broken
hardware, such that it at least allows it to work, right?  It also
provides a better incentive for the manufacturer to fix their bios,
which as you are on-site at HP, it would seem odd that they would just
not do that instead of trying to work around this in the kernel...
