Well you are right. It seems to be either fixed in the newer kernel or not 
effecting the newer kernel. These two both worked fine with the redhat compiled 
2.6.7:
Linux solem.cs.man.ac.uk 2.6.7-1.517 #1 Wed Aug 11 16:28:33 EDT 2004 i686 athlon 
i386 GNU/Linux
Linux hilly.house 2.6.7-1.517 #1 Wed Aug 11 16:28:33 EDT 2004 i686 i686 i386 
GNU/Linux
Did you have an idea of what was causing this?
