I never had any trouble with stack footprint even with gcc 3.3 on x86-64
and unit-at-a-time and it was always enabled. 
But one caveat: turning on unit-at-a-time makes objdump -S / make
foo/bar.lst with CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO essentially useless because objdump
cannot deal with functions being out of order in the object file. This
can be a big problem while analyzing oopses - essentially you have
to analyze the functions without source level information. And with
unit-at-a-time they become bigger so it's more difficult.
But I still think it's a good idea.
