Subject: [PATCH 000 of 11] knfsd: Introduction - Make knfsd more NUMA-aware
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Following are 11 patches from Greg Banks which combine to make knfsd
more Numa-aware.  They reduce hitting on 'global' data structures, and
create some data-structures that can be node-local.
knfsd threads are bound to a particular node, and the thread to handle
a new request is chosen from the threads that are attach to the node
that received the interrupt.
The distribution of threads across nodes can be controlled by a new
file in the 'nfsd' filesystem, though the default approach of an even
spread is probably fine for most sites.
Some (old) numbers that show the efficacy of these patches:
N == number of NICs == number of CPUs == nmber of clients.
Number of NUMA nodes == N/2
N	Throughput, MiB/s	CPU usage, % (max=N*100)
