Yup.  This is not technically impossible, but the patches don't add an
interface needed for this purpose.
Initially I thought of a sysfs-based one, but it didn't seem to be a good
solution.  I'm going to add an ioctl() to /dev/snapshot that will allow us
to set the "resume offset" from an application.

Well, not from a swap file.  To use a swap file for suspending we need a
kernel to tell us which page "slots" are available to us (otherwise we could
overwrite some swapped-out pages).
We could use a regular (non-swap) file like this but that would require us to
use some dangerous code (ie. one that writes directly to blocks belonging to
certain file bypassing the filesystem).  IMHO this isn't worth it, provided
the kernel's swap-handling code can do this for us and is known to work. ;-)
Greetings,
