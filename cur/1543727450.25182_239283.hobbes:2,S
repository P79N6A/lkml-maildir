Pardon my ignorance...
Under what conditions is it NOT OK to convert "extern inline"
to "static inline"?
Linus once wrote:

But Richard Henderson rejected (in 2002) the following patch (excerpt):
-#define __EXTERN_INLINE extern inline
+#define __EXTERN_INLINE static inline
presumably because the exact semantics of extern inline were
required.  I can only find __EXTERN_INLINE in the alpha
architecture.  Is the requirement to use 'extern' rather
than 'static' unique to alpha?
Thanks for any illumination on this.
