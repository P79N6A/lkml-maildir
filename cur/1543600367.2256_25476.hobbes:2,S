I disagree! First of all you can always use NFS over TCP, so much for
"every thing else uses filehandles/UDP". (No that this improves security,
but it can improve reliability!)
Yes - but it won't work in the environment. As you pointed out, it works
under Solaris. No MACs, No Linux, and no MS windows (which would likely be
present in a lab).
Second, without physical security you can't protect the access keys - hence
no kerberos.
