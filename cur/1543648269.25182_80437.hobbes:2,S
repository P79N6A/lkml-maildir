Subject: [BUG] 2.5.43 IDE not powered down on shutdown

2.5.43 doesn't power down IDE devices on shutdown on my 486 laptop.
2.5.42 did.
However, the disk squeeks on shutdown, which I am positive is due to
it being sent a spin down command, followed immediately by a spin-up command.
I think this might be a result of the discussion about not powering
down devices over a re-boot, as I think Slackware uses slightly
different options to halt on a shutdown than is usual, (but I could be
wrong).
I haven't had time to try 2.5.43 on other machines yet, but I will do
later on today.
John.
