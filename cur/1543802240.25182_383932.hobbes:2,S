Hugh, you're a genious!
I added your small patch on top of your previous one and now
2.6.15-mm2 doesn't crash any more  :-)
Thanks a lot.
2.6.15-mm2 still has a few other problems for me though, which I'll
report in a short while in sepperate threads - a lot easier to
investigate now that the box no longer crashes while running that
kernel :)
Thank you again for your work in fixing this problem.
