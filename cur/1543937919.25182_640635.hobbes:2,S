Type safety is good but I doubt this would be worth the complexity.  It
has some benefits but there's much larger benefit in keeping things in
straight C.  People know that functions take fixed types and are also
familiar with the convention of passing void * for callback arguments.
IMHO, staying in line with those common knowledges easily trumps having
type checking on interrupt handler.
Also, how often do we see a bug where things go wrong because interrupt
handler is given the wrong type of argument?  Even when such bug
happens, I doubt it can escape the developer's workstation if he/she is
paying any attention to testing.
Thanks.
