Hi.
	When I do dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda9, all other disk operations
(including swapping) are suspended until dd terminates. The same with dd
if=/dev/zero of=foo. I have ide disk. There's probably bad implementation
of request queue. Something like request ages should be implemented. Has
anyone another idea what to do with it?
