Subject: [PATCH][RESEND][silly] Reduce size of the xterm-linux.xpm image by 12 bytes.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Ok, this is a bit silly (but also a little fun) :-)
In Documentation/ we have the xterm-linux.xpm image.
Now an XPM image is more or less C code, so I thought it would 
be fun to look at it like that and put on the CodingStyle and 
space use glasses.
I made two changes, none of which change the actual image.
 1) I removed two lines that just had empty comments.
 2) I brought the 'image_name' declaration into line with how 
    we commonly write arrays and pointers.
This saves us an astonishing 12 bytes on the file size ;-)
That's a little less data for every future Linux kernel source 
user to download - that can't be bad.
Ok, ok, so it does have the drawback of being 99,999% churn and 
you could argue that it'll clutter the git history. So if you 
don't apply it I won't hate you (too much) ;-)
