because of the pci busses, memory etc. it's got to be read and
transmitted. I'll be glad if i don't need to worry

Does this mean the system could run smoothly on very low memory - say -
128MB RAM?

Does this mean I can choose whatever gigE card I want?
How about SCSI drivers?

Not silly. I'm not a kernel hacker. I ask naiive questions due to the fact
that I find it better to ask and get to know something, than staying
unknowable of some fact. But thanks for telling me it's of no problem.

How about XFS? I've heard it's better pushing large files...

I thought more about security. I don't want anyone exploiting potential
security holes.

How about cpu overhead in iptables/kernel when it processes packets that
are allowed? How about connection tracking? Is the rule order in iptables
important when it comes to speed?
I apologize if some of these questions may seem a little stupid. Please do
not flame
