The suspend/resume calls have been removed from the drm drivers and
returning them doesn't solve the resume problems (I guess either agp
isn't woken up properly or something is happening in the wrong order. I
haven't had time to investigate further). And I have a simple mach64
(rage mobility m1) card which is relatively easy to wake up since not
much needs to be done (the agp bus is via).
