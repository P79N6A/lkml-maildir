it's not attached, but I guess I can hack the mmap2 myself too by just
increasing the number of tasks and number of mmaps ;).
But before doing more tests I think I will finish my anon_vma work and
the objrmap optimizations, then I can concentrante on the testing. At
the moment we already know various bits that can be optimized, so I
prefer to get those implemented first.
another important thing is that we've a reschedule point for every
different page we unmap, not sure if it's the case right now (I didn't
concentrate much on the callers yet).
