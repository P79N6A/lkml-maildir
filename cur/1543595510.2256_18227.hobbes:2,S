Just released: util-linux-2.11g
* MCONFIG & configure: fix for gcc 3.0
  Note that nfsmount_xdr.c may give warnings with gcc 3.0, essentially
  because of defines in <rpc/xdr.h> that use things like ntohl(*buf++)
  where ntohl(x) is a macro with several occurrences of x.
* blockdev: support for the get/set blocksize ioctls
  [not yet in the 2.4.5 kernel]
* fdisk: added Linux/PA-RISC type (Matt Taggart)
* mount: minor fix (Andrey J. Melnikoff)
* mount: added some ext3 stuff (Andrew Morton)
* mount: added heuristics for reiserfs (Andrew Morton)
* mount.8: added ext3 and reiserfs docs (Andrew Morton)
