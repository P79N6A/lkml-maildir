But so the change would be a good thing, right? It would make the behavior 
consistent between all configuration tools, CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDESCSI would 
be not selectable in either. So people would have to notice that this 
statement is broken and fix it.

If they do, they should be fixed. And, as I pointed out before, it is 
possible to fix even shell-based parsers.

So you agree a bit of spring cleaning wouldn't hurt, right? ;)

Well, you're right here. Which makes me think of my original idea as to 
define all CONFIG_* values to "n" unless they've explicitly been assign 
another value before.

The main usage currently is "make oldconfig", though .config may be a bit 
confusing: Questions which have been answered before (even with "n") will 
not be asked again, whereas for undefined symbols, the corresponding 
question is put.
So I think the logic should really be tristate, "n","m","y", plus 
additionally a list of CONFIG_* values which have been defined (as opposed 
to just being "n" by default). This would get rid of the non-intuitive 
behavior of dep_* and allow simplifying all the if [ == "n" || == "" ] 
duplication. It's a bit cumbersome to implement in shell, but surely 
possible.
Of course, this is a 2.5 change, though the only potential for breakage 
are the dep_* statements which are arguably already broken. It shouldn't 
be too hard to come up with a script which points out the dep_* statements 
which reference symbols defined only later (or use gcml2, which I 
understand can do that already?) to see how much breakage there may be.
