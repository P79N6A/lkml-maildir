On Arima notebook here, whole machine takes 28W on 800MHz, idle
(measured using external power meter), 33W with max backlight, and 68W
at 2GHz, computing. Going to HZ=100 makes it one Watt less. I'd say
that's quite significant. [17W number was based on internal power
meter when running on battery].
So yes, CPU *is* taking more than all other perihepals.
