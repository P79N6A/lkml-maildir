What is snapshot date? Is it before Andrea's af_unix fixes were merged
or after?
If the first oops could be explained (in theory) by some bug in af_unix,
and the second ooops is apparent followup to the first one, third oops
looks really funny. For beginning, how gzip could call tcp sendmsg()? 8)8)8)
It smells like buggy hardware. Try to tune cache/memory parameters in
bios setup. My experience prompts that such strange things are explained
mainly by too optimistic settings there and tuning usually helps.
