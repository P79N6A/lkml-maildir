I believe that the processes we've all been using for the past year have
worked well (invitation here for people to disagree).  So any changes we
make to that process shouldn't be arbitrary.
I expect that until 2.7.0 forks, Linus and I shall continue to work 2.6.x
in much the same manner - that's what I'd prefer, anyway.
Obviously, the threshold for merging things into 2.6 becomes higher, and
large changes will be rejected pending more review and testing.  I shall
continue to run an alternate tree for the provision of that testing
service.
Generally, we should expect that there will be large changes across the 2.6
lifetime - it is unrealistic to believe otherwise.  We just need to find
the processes to absorb those changes (and feed them into or from 2.7.x)
without breaking stuff.  We've done that fairly well across 2.5 I think.
We should sit tight for the next week or so, in case we need to rush out a
2.6.1 for brown-bag bugs.  After that I need to shrink the -mm patchset
rather a lot.

Nick has been maintaining these lists lately - hopefully he can send me an

I doubt that people will be critially dependent on NFS4 client
functionality in 2.6 for a while, and your changes will only affect NFS4,
so go wild.
If the change was more intrusive then it would be better to
maintain+develop it in -mm until we've all happy, then merge it across.

OK.
