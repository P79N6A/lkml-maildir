Rusty,
I started going through the kernel, adding MODULE_VERSION("foo")
everywhere, but there are a lot of modules which are not separately
versioned, and a value of MODULE_VERSION("") would be appropriate.
How hard would it be to always include the space for the
MODULE_VERSION("") data rather than specifying it in each file that
doesn't care, and only modules with their own versioning could put
MODULE_VERSION("myversion") to override the default?
Thanks,
Matt
