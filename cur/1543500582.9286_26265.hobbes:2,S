Meaning that the Linux boxes should be able to mount volumes exported by
the mainframe?  That shouldn't be a problem; just do a "mount
host:/export /mountpoint"  It works well enough mounting FBSD shares;
I'm sure it would work with os/390 too (which would probably be running
a *nix, anyhow, which actually exports the volumes).

Not really an issue, as long as there is TCP/IP connectivity available. 
NFS is on a higher layer than are the ethernet; refer to your OSI
model...

os/390 rox. :)  for task 2, don't.  Use *BSD or something else.  Linux
NFS is not consistently reliable right now (to put it *really* nicely). 
Hopefully it will be soon.
