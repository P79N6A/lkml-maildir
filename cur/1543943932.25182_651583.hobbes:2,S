can you see any practical relevance? Your patch description only deals 
with the mechanical details of the change instead of analyzing the most 
important thing: relevance and impact analysis. That makes it harder to 
add your patches and easier to miss a good fix accidentally. It also 
makes it quite a bit harder to trust your patches.
at a quick glance the relevance is to EFI only, in 
efi_enter_virtual_mode(). max_pfn_mapped is used as a differentiator 
between __va() and efi_ioremap(). AFAICS EFI will typically have its 
runtime code not right after the end of physical memory.
Nevertheless, i do agree that the max_pfn_mapped/end_pfn_map limit needs 
to be sharpened to reflect reality (for later PAT support).
your patch is also a bit unclean:

a meaningless "r" parameter. Use "true_end" instead.
and here's another type of variable naming problem:

> +init_memory_mapping(unsigned long start, unsigned long end)

that "true_end" is already a _pfn_, so name it accordingly: 
true_end_pfn. Because we switch between pfn and addr types it's 
important to point out where it's pfn and where it's a linear/physical 
address.

rename "r" to "true_end_pfn".
