Please post a kernel profile for the problematic workload with the
"good" and "bad" kernels (search the list archive for Andrew Morton's
instructions on doing it with oprofile, email me privately if you
can't find it).

The meaning of these numbers can change drastically from one minor
release to the next, and the docs often lag behind the code.
I would not focus on tweaking VM knobs, but on describing the problem
in enough detail to fix the kernel - it's a bug if the same workload
regresses significantly from one release to another.
