Interesting. For my laptop, I have configured like 90 for
dirty_background_ratio and 95 for dirty_ratio. Makes for a nice
delayed write, but I do not do workloads bigger than extracing kernel
tarballs (~250 MB) and coding away on that machine (488 MB RAM) anyway.
Setting it to something like 95, I could probably rm -Rf the kernel
tree again and the disk never gets active because it is all cached.
But if dirty_ratio is lowered, the disk will get active soon.
