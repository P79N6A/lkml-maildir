Pretty decent.  It misses a lot of hardware details that we still
depend on the BIOS to reliably setup for us.
I've got code that does all of this so, setup on a couple of
boards so it should just be a matter of tracking it down and including
it in the documentation.
If there is interest I'll start tracking it down as soon as I have a
free minute.
