Got it.  I am merging packet capture support into the e1000 for DSFS for 
direct cache DMA support.  I noticed the two distinct fill routines
for the ring buffer.  I have enabled DSFS for both with this driver.  I 
will post patches late tonight or in the morning for the 82571 support 
for DSFS.  I will
also be posting the patches for 2.6.12, 2.6.10. 2.6.14, Suse 9 and 10.0, 
Red Hat ES/AS 3 and 4, and Fedora Core 2/3/4 by end of week with the
packet splitting capabilities with packet capture on DSFS.  This is a 
very good optimization and should come in handy for reducing header copies
in the protocol stacks.
