David,
Do you have a SERIAL directive in your syslinux.cfg (or ISOLINUX
equivalent) file on the boot CD?
Per the Syslinux readme.doc:
SERIAL port [[baudrate] flowcontrol]
I have been using:
serial 0 38400 0x003
on an embedded system, booting from either a CompactFlash or
DiskOnChip.  
My flowcontrol parm is:
0x001 - Assert DTR + 0x002 - Assert RTS for a NULL modem cable.
The port number corresponds to ports detected by the BIOS.
