Hi,
The "Linux Device Drivers" book by Rubini says that only Alpha and sparc
architectures allow to debug the kernel over serial line.
However, I remember someone telling me on last Linux-UK conference that it
can be done (without specifying architecture).
Therefore - my question: can I step through the kernel (starting from
bootsector) by using a second computer connected via serial line?
I did not find any (mini)HOWTO on the subject :(
I am aware of patch-ikd and use it but it certainly does not let you step
through the bootsector or initialisation code as it requires live
(running) kernel.
Thanks in advance,
Tigran.
