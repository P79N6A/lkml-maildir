yeah, that would be fine too. The "irq chips" name has the advantage 
that it points out that this stuff deals with actual hardware, but no 
strong feelings either way.

yeah, but only 335 times in drivers/*, so it's a 4 minute job to convert 
them over. (ok, i just did it to check - it results in a 144K patch and 
it took 50 seconds to do. I've attached the result.)

ok, agreed.
