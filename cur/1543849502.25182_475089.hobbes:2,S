Unless I am going very very mad, this has came up once before some
months ago.  We went through lots of pain finding the cause of this for
NUMA-Q and fixing it.  Something about not having a sysdata and needing
to initialise it.
Thought so, this was all discussed back in December 2005.

I'll go see if I can forward port the patch and address the remaining
issues with it.
