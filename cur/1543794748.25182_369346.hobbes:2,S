How is graphics going to be dealt with on Linux? Is the Linux desktop
going to stay stuck in 1998 since that is the last year the graphics
vendors released specs? If the choice is "open source or die" then
that's the answer. Of course that answer is bad news desktop Linux
distributions and they may die.
If the choice instead is to embrace current graphics hardware, then
given the current state of the market, I don't see any other
alternative than using the proprietary drivers and OpenGL stacks. The
path in that direction is something like Xgl.  We can wish for a
non-proprietary choice on the current hardware, but the reality is
that we are not going to get it.
