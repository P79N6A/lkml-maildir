Yes, he was rude, but then again you were provocative when you called
us a bunch of "closed minded idiots" or something like that. Some of
us tried to explain why you can't expect the kernel distribution to be
changed. There's even a FAQ entry explaining it. You may not like it,
but have the good grace to accept it. If you can't accept it, it is up
to *you* to provide an alternative service. Given that this thread has
come back so many times, I can assure you your service would be
appreciated.
You could even make such a service available by subscription only:
make a quid out of it. People may even be willing to pay money. I
expect it wouldn't be hard to get enough money to fund a bigger disc,
at least. It might even pay for your time.
It can't be repeated enough: Linux is a volunteer effort. We work on
what we feel like. If you want something done, you have to do it
yourself. What you have asked for would make our lives harder, so we
will be even less inclined to do what you want. So there is a double
onus on you to do this. Don't keep pestering us to do it for you.
Have you actually bothered to read the FAQ entry?

Bear in mind that linux-kernel is a diverse forum just like any other
group of people. Hence you are going to get all sorts of personality
types. Life is like that. Deal with it. It's easy enough to
unsubscribe from linux-kernel, but are you going to unsubscribe from
life just because some stranger is rude to you?
