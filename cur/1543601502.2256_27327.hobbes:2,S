Granted.  But it it does seem to be the cause for the set of systems affected.
And it nicely illustrates the point that you can have very weird problems that
don't show up under normal circumstances.
In the kt133 case it feels like a problem initializing the cpu<->northbridge bus.
In Rons case it is probably completely different.
