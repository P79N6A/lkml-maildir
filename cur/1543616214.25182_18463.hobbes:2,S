Why? Using a perfectly well documented extension is certainly not wrong. Or 
are you saying one shouldn't use gcc extensions?!? We should rewrite half 
the kernel then...

His code is not broken at all. gcc has just turned on its head. I 
absolutely agree with Andrew here that gcc shouldn't do that.
The gcc-2.96 manual which I just looked up explicitly says for __FUNCTION__:
---quote---
  The compiler automagically replaces the identifiers with a string
literal containing the appropriate name. Thus, they are neither
preprocessor macros, like `__FILE__' and `__LINE__', nor variables.
This means that they catenate with other string literals, and that they
can be used to initialize char arrays. For example
      char here[] = "Function " __FUNCTION__ " in " __FILE__;
---quota---
So now they are suddenly saying "sorry we are changing how __FUNCTION__ 
works" which is ridiculous IMO.
What is wrong with keeping __FUNCTION__ as it is?!?
Note that gcc-2.96 also supports __func__ and that has the C-99 defined 
semantics so clearly both can co-exist without a problem... Again from the 
gcc-2.96 manual:
  GNU CC also supports the magic word `__func__', defined by the ISO
standard C-99:
---quote---
      The identifier `__func__' is implicitly declared by the translator
      as if, immediately following the opening brace of each function
      definition, the declaration
           static const char __func__[] = "function-name";
      appeared, where function-name is the name of the lexically-enclosing
      function. This name is the unadorned name of the function.
    By this definition, `__func__' is a variable, not a string literal.
In particular, `__func__' does not catenate with other string literals.
---quote---
Taking functionality away like this seems to me (never even seen the gcc 
source) very silly.
Best regards,
         Anton
ps. Yeah, I know gcc-2.96 is not an official gcc release but I don't care. 
It works and it's the only compiler I have here to look the docs up for...
