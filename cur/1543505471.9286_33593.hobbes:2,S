Subject: Lost emails fixed.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I just determined why I was not getting the mailing list.  I
changed permissions on my incoming mail directory by accident,
and the mail was being accepted by fetchmail, sent to sendmail,
deleted from my ISP's, and then forwarded to procmail which could
not put the mail into my inbox so deleted it.
ARGH!!!!!
I've lost 3 days of email at least, however some stuff did get
through.
Could anyone that has sent me an email in the last few days,
please resend the messages again?  This goes for any of the
mailing lists that I'm on.
Also, anyone who knows someone that has sent something to me,
please forward this to them as well.
procmail is a useful subsystem, however it would be nice if it
would file email that cant be delivered into a separate folder or
something instead of deleting it.
Anyone know how to do that to prevent any possibility of a
repeat occurance in the future?
