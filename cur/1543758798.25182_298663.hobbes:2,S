It is, but that's even more interesting.  Namely, the BIOS-e820 memory map
looks as follows:
BIOS-provided physical RAM map:
 BIOS-e820: 0000000000000000 - 000000000009fc00 (usable)
 BIOS-e820: 000000000009fc00 - 00000000000a0000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000000e0000 - 0000000000100000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 0000000000100000 - 000000001ff40000 (usable)
 BIOS-e820: 000000001ff40000 - 000000001ff50000 (ACPI data)
 BIOS-e820: 000000001ff50000 - 0000000020000000 (ACPI NVS)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000fec00000 - 00000000fec01000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000fee00000 - 00000000fee01000 (reserved)
and the pages in the first two reserved areas are properly marked as reserved.
Moreover, there is an apparent hole between a0000 and e0000 which also
is marked as reserved.  However, we treat all of these pages as saveable
(a page is treated as non-saveable if it is marked as reserved _and_ satisfies
specific condition which is met by only one page on my system).  Consequently,
during resume we try to overwrite all of these pages and we not only try to
write to (theoretically) read-only areas, but also we try to write to where there's
nothing. :-)
Still, there are almost 3500 reserved pages on my system and I'm not sure that
we don't need to save at least some of them.  Anyway, I'm attaching the full
list of pages that are marked as reserved and treated as saveable, so they get
overwritten during resume.  Please have a look (these are virtual x86-64
addresses, but the mapping is straightforward).
Greets,
Rafael
