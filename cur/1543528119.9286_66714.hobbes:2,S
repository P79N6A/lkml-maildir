 Well, it seems to work, but I don't think this is an accurate
 test. How do I identify a broken ACPI implementation?

 An Mobile P-II even drains the battery a fair lot if
 halting the CPU. I'd like to have "suspend to ram",
 "suspend to disk", controlling the backlight of the LCD
 (if nothing or apmd is running it'll turn at least off 
 after the timeout time set in BIOS and when the notebook
 is shut. When running acpid I get nothing!), intelligent
 harddisk management and more...

 Yes. It's always nice not to know how much time/battery
 is left. (Of course the notebook has a special function to
 show the percentage of battery left, but it's uncomfortable
 to activate it every 10 minutes and the turn it off again to
 have the keyboard back again.)

 I'm waiting and using APM in the meantime since there's
 no way to get them both....
