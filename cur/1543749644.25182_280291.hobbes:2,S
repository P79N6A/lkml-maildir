Heh.  Figures.  Those freezes are what bothers me most, since I've already got a 
patch that protects critical processes from being OOM-killed as long as they're 
sane.
I just want an OOM-killer that is FAST and doesn't lock up the machine.  I don't 
really care what it kills, since it won't be *able* to kill anything really 
critical.
