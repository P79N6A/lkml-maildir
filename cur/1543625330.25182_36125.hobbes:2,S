p_pptr changed to parent and you could just swap them in the code, 
IE:
task_struct->p_pptr would become task_struct->parent
Not sure about the p_opptr, but I bet you'll find the same type of change.  
I found this on Sparc64 as well, if you grep the 2.5.7 patch file, you
should be able to find p_opptr pretty quickly, I bet.
Hope this helps..
