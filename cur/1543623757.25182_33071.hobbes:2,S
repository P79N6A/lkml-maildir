With the futex approach in mind: Does anybody think it's desirable to have
pthread_cond_wait/signal and pthread_mutex_* with inter process scope build
into the kernel as system call?
The only issue I see so far, is that libpthread should get a "reserved" namespace
entry ( /dev/shm/.linuxthreads-locks ?) to hold all the PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARE
locks/condvars.
OTOH Irix seems to implement inter process locks as syscall, so that the kernel does
all the bookkeeping. That approach denies a malicious program to trash all locks
in the system...
Hmh, then we could implement a per user /dev/shm/.linuxthreads-lock-<uid> with
tight permissions?
What do you think?
