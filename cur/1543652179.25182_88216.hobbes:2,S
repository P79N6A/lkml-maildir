Yep. There was a recent fbdev API rewrite, not all of the drivers have
been converted yet. (The radeonfb driver, eg, does this too.)
You can fix it by looking at the changesets from the PPC Bitkeeper tree
at 
http://ppc.bkbits.net:8080/linuxppc-2.5
 ... the changes are fairly
straightforward, I did this and got radeonfb working under 2.5.45.
