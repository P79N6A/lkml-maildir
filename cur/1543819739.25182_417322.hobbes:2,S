I don't believe so. We are just a user of register_security and we don't
poke around the exported symbol. I guess I'll defer full judgement till I
see the actual patch but based on the 10,000' it seems reasonable to me.
Anyways, it seems like for the immediate you're just looking at tagging
it EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL which sounds fine too.  I need to make you a t-shirt
with that on it :)
