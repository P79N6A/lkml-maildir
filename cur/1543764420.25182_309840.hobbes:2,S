Its goes well beyond the initial 7000 number I mentioned. Thanks.
One side-effect of this patch is: for example we have only two processes 
running on a cpu and both are pinned to that cpu. If someone comes and 
changes the affinity of one of these processes to all cpu's in the system, 
then it might take MAX_PINNED_INTERVAL before this process moves to an idle cpu.
thanks,
