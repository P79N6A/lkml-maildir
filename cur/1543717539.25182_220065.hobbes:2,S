Wrong interface.  We need to pass a struct agp_bridge_data to
each of the methods anyway for proper support for multiple AGP
bridges in a single system.  And once you have that you can simply
use the node id your patches stores in agp_bridge_data.

wrong default again.  for the agp bridges that have an associated pci
device (aka about everything except hpzx and alpha IIRC) you should
use pcibus_to_cpumask (or what the thing was called).  For the others
you should try to contact the maintainers for a proper choice.
