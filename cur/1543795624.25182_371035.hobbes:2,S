-rt20 BUGs and dies on boot with an assertion at line 1931 of
fs/jbd/transaction.c:
1924 void __journal_file_buffer(struct journal_head *jh,
1925                         transaction_t *transaction, int jlist)
1926 {
1927         struct journal_head **list = NULL;
1928         int was_dirty = 0;
1929         struct buffer_head *bh = jh2bh(jh);
