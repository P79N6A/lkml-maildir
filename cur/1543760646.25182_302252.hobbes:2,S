I cannot agree more. Many developers and maintainers say they don't care about 
binary modules - but I do have the impression a few of them care a lot by 
doing changes in a way that they break the current NVIDIA drivers on every 
new kernel release. As I read now, it seems to be the same way with ATI. Even 
GPL drivers developed outside the kernel are disfigured over and over with 
#ifdefs on KERNEL_VERSION.
While I fully understand that no developer wants to support binary modules, I 
would appreciate a little less hostile behaviour. And btw., instable API 
leads to an instable kernel because not everyone can follow the changes.
