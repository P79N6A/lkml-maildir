So if you've got a CPU, that you have to load the microcode into before
fully booting, you can't run linux on it natively, unless the CPU maker
provides full microcode source? 
Presumably the "preferred form" clause would mean that there must 
be hardware documentation too.
And when is a binary a binary, and not a string constant?
