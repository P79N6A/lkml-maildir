OK, that's fine, but the next step is to have "make ARCH=x86" compile,
with a config option as to whether to build 32 or 64 bit.  This will
involve a fair amount of Makefile hair, but if you can get Andi to buy
into that then the rest is a simple matter of code churn.  For most
kernel hackers, this would be the flag day.
Moving the rest of the files across to xxx_32.c, xxx_64.h etc is going
to involve a great deal of untangling and code cleanup.  It's also going
to completely screw a whole heap of my cleanup patches.  Oh well.
(Still hoping for an executive summary from the PPC folks).
Cheers!
Rusty.
