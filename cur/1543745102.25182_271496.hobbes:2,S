great. The current release is meanwhile at -V0.7.27-10, which includes
other minor updates:
 - two fixes to the wakeup timing code - this should resolve some of the
   weird traces reported by Mark H. Johnson.
 - two minor tweaks to the wakeup/reschedule path which should improve
   wakeup latencies.
