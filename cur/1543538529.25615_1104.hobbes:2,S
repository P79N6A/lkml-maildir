I just sent Alan a patch against pre-2.2.17-10 that upgrades sym53c8xx 
and ncr53c8xx drivers to their latest respective assumed stable version.
The patch is available from the following location:
ftp://ftp.tux.org/pub/roudier/drivers/linux/stable/
	sym-1.7.0-ncr-3.4.0-for-pre-2.2.17-10.patch.gz
  Gerard.
PS:
The resulted driver sources, once patch applied, are in full sync with 
the FreeBSD sym driver as committed to the RELENG_4 (new -stable) branch.
