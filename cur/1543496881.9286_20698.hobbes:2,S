If you are not already using knfs (rather than the orignal userland NFS)
then switch to the knfs stuff.  I had severe, reproduceable corruption
with userland NFS, but it seemed to go away with the knfs stuff.
To test for problems with either version, it is best done
with a single machine.  Just export to yourself, and try it out,
especially with large amounts of data.
The connection is way faster than any network, and exposes all
sorts of interesting races.
Not using NFS at the moment here.
