That's OK with me.  As an example, on the MIPS side of things, Ralf 
sends most MIPS stuff straight to Linus, but I queue all his 
drivers/net/* patches into my queue, and that gets submitted separately 
(though just as rapidly) upstream with other net driver changes.
I certainly do recognize that qeth, in particular, is a network driver 
unlike all others in the kernel ;-)
