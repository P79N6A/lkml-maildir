Sounds exactly like the problem i was having. However the logical
thought behind it was that it must be either 1) a hardware specific
problem, or 2) a generic usb driver problem. Since only a handful
of people seen the problem, then this logically leads one to the
conclusion that our usb<->ide devices have some marginal timing
issues that are being triggered with the new code.

Well in my case i opted for the slow backup rather than the no backup
if i wanted to move forward with the new kernels.
Cheers

nforce2 with the ehci-driver.

I also reported this problem there, but didn't get a reply at all.

Well, I only see this with 2.4.22-pre/rc, so this is definitly not a
hardware-problem, it runs just fine with 2.4.21 at 9950 kB/s.
And running my backup on USB 1.1 is not an option, way to slow.
