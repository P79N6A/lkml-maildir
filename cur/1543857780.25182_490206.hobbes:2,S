My patch was incorrect; it would only repeatingly copy the first
character from the source.
This one (tested in test-code seperate from kernel) works:
diff -uNrBbd lib/string.c string-new.c
--- lib/string.c        2006-11-04 02:33:58.000000000 +0100

        char *tmp = dest;
        while (count) {
-               if ((*tmp = *src) != 0)

        return dest;
The improvement in speed depends on the size of the source and
destination. Maybe i did something wrong but it seems that in all cases
the new version is faster.
