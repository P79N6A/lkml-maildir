Agreed.  At least until someone defines a user-mode
linux-security-module.  We may want a different security module
in effect for a particular guest.  Which modules you get
being defined by the one system administrator is fine.
The primary case I see worth worry about is using 
a security module to ensure isolation of a container,
while still providing the selinux mandatory capabilities
to a container.
