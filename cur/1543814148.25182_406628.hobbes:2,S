The user can write a block of code that they would like to be executed
repeatedly in fixed intervals.  A trivial example might look like this:
    probe timer.ms(10) { flush_data(); }
This would flush the data every 10ms.
A example of polling might be:
    probe timer.ms(1) { log(scheduler_queue_length()); }
I hope this answers your questions...
