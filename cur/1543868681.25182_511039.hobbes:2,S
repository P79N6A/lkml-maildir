I got following.
delta for syscall: 9112 cycles = 2.977778 us
delta for syscall: 1224 cycles = 0.400000 us
delta for syscall: 1071 cycles = 0.350000 us
delta for syscall: 1054 cycles = 0.344444 us
delta for syscall: 1054 cycles = 0.344444 us
Likely first overhead related to cache population or gamma-ray radiation.
If it happens only one (it does in my test), then everything is ok I
think. Bert, how frequently you get that long recvfrom()?
