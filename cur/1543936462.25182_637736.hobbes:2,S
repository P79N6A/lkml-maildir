I agree, I quite dislike it too. Even If the breakage on x86 makes us
want to totally disable it there, it can be done within the existing PCI
ops I believe.
I think Arjan's problem is to try to do it per-device since the
"standard" PCI ops don't get a pci_dev structure (for obvious reasons).
But from what I read in this thread, this per-device enabling/disabling
doesn't seem very useful at all.
Cheers,
