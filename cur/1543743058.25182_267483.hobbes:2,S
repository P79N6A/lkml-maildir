Hi all,
I have already hard wired the fg and bg colours. I have got to the point 
where I am checking the cfbimgblt code where it converts the mono bit font
image data to the 8bpp pseudo colour screen image data. It is looking
like there may be a problem with sign extension at this level as the
pixel value being used apears to be 255.
I have changed a char *pt to a u8 *pt to see if this helps.
Regards
	Mark Fortescue.
