Actually I am interested in the common case, where the machine is not 
out of space, or memory, or CPU, but when it is appropriately sized to 
the workload. Not that I lack interest in corner cases, but the "running 
flat out" case doesn't reflect case where there's enough hardware, now 
the o/s needs to use it well.
The one high load benchmark I would love to see is a web server, running 
tux, with a load over a large (number of files) distributed data set. 
The much faster tar create times posted make me think that a server with 
a lot of files would benefit, when CPU and memory requirements are not a 
bottleneck.
