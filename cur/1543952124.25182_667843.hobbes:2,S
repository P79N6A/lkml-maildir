I agree that it should end up using bsr. It would look like this in
the end, I guess. Might be familiar.
#if BITS_PER_LONG == 32
static inline int fls64(__u64 x)
{
        __u32 h = x >> 32;
        if (h)
                return __fls(h) + 33;
        return fls(x);
}
#else
static inline int fls64(__u64 x)
{
        if (x == 0)
                return 0;
        return __fls(x) + 1;
}
#endif

This is the only reason that this define exists. With another
name it would be fine. HWEIGHT_USE_MULTIPLIER?

And my feeling is that this is exactly the reason why this is
not a good version for a generic implementation in bitops.h. But
I don't care much.
