The fact we have fs recursion is actually bad, but purely because we don't
have dynamic stack allocation. (Which we dont want either). With a non 
recudsive follow link we could probably go back to 4K stacks. If thats the
case then on x86 recursive link following currently costs us 4K a process
idle, or otherwise. Ie about 350K of unswappable memory on my box currently.

Try a self referencing symlink on smbfs - although that appears to be
not entirely the VFS fault.
