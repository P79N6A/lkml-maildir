Absolutely. In fact, with the new implementation, you can often write
_several_ packets of 4096 bytes without blocking (but only writes less
than PIPE_BUF are guaranteed to be done all-or-nothing). I'm very aware of
the atomicity guarantees, I'm just saying that if you try to write 4096 
bytes by doing it one byte at a time, that has changed.

I absolutely agree. A regular read()/write() still copies the data, and 
that's because I'm a firm believer that copying even a few kB of data is 
likely to be cheaper than trying to play MM games (not just the lookup of 
the physical address - all the locking, COW, etc crud that VM games 
require).
So while this shares some of the issues with the zero-copy pipes of yore,
but doesn't actually do any of that for regular pipe read/writes. And
never will, as far as I'm concerned. I just don't think user zero-copy is 
interesting at that level: if the user wants to access somethign without 
copying, he uses "mmap()".
So only when the data is _not_ in user VM space, that's when increasing a
reference count is cheaper than copying. Pretty much by definition, you
already have a "struct page *" at that point, along with which part of the
page contains the data.
So the "standard behaviour" (aka just plain read/write on the pipe) is all
the same copies that it used to be. The "just move pages around" issue
only happens when you want to duplicate the stream, or if you splice
around stuff that is already in kernel buffers (or needs a kernel buffer
anyway).
