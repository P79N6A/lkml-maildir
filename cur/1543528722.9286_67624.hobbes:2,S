Hi,
mount on an open directory succeeds. A directory can be opened either by
exlicitely calling open or by doing a cd.
#cp /etc/passwd /mnt3/a
#cd /mnt3
#mount -t ext2 /dev/sda6 /mnt3
#ls
lost+found
#ls -l
ls: lost+found: No such file or directory
total 0
#cat a
root:x:0:0....
.............
.......
#
Is the bug in d_mount() where a check,  whether the mountpoint directory is
open, is not made?
Thanks.
