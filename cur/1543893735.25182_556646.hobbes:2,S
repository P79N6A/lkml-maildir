So, can you resize a filesystem both bigger and smaller?  Or is that
implicit in the Object level mirroring and striping?  
As a user of Netapps, having quotas (if only for reporting purposes)
and some way to migrate non-used files to slower/cheaper storage would
be great.
Ie. being able to setup two pools, one being RAID6, the other being
RAID1, where all currently accessed files are in the RAID1 setup, but
if un-used get migrated to the RAID6 area.  
And of course some way for efficient backups and more importantly
RESTORES of data which is segregated like this.
