Yup, I know about this possibility, but this is only x86 specific?!

concludes it's not multiplatform at all... For that reasen I (maybe) want some 
"protocol" for communication with US, where I can easily compute it.
Another way could be rtai (there is FP implemented IIRC), but it means having 
out-of-kernel driver.
