For posterity's sake:
The problem is evidently a hardware problem, and I'll have to
return the board to the manufacturer so they can solder on another
part.
So, if you want to use 4-port NICs in slot-5 of the SuperMicro X6DVA-EG
board, then purchase the X6DVA-4G instead, as the X6DVA-EG will NOT work.
Actually, anything that tries to use the 3rd PCI function will probably fail
as well...
Enjoy,
Ben
