Subject: RFC-patch - make sysfs_create_group skip members with attr.mode == 0
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Currently, code in hwmon/*.c uses sysfs_create_group less than it could.
A contributing reason is that many individual attr-files are created 
conditionally,
depending upon both underlying hardware, driver configuration, etc.
With proposed patch, the members of a group are conditionally created,
based upon the mode of the underlying attribute.  mode == 0 suppresses 
attr-file
creation, allowing run-time tweaks of compile-time defined groups.
The driver defining the group need only disable the unwanted members
before calling sysfs_create_group()  (theyre 'enabled' by initialization 
macros,
since thats the most useful default)
Specifically
- only group members are created conditionally,
    theres no effect on calls to device_create_file.
- only mode == 0 disables member creation,
    common values like  S_IWUSR | S_IRUGO have un-altered behavior.
