Humble suggestion:  Add a date field for "took over maintainence
on/before: yyyy-mm-dd" and a field for "last verified: yyyy-mm-dd" so we
know when we last checked on the existance/etc. of a maintainer.  (And
maybe an "AWAL on/before: yyyy-mm-dd" for those without known working
addresses.)
Thoughts?
Ah, I see Russell King made a similar suggestion...
