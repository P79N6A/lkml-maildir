While that might be true, it's a separate problem.

What does "officially supported" mean?  Especially the
"officially" part.  Is this documented somewhere?

If any developer is interested in supporting some certain old
compiler version, he should be testing regularly with it.  Sounds
like that's you ;-)
If no developer is interested, we shouldn't claim to support
using that compiler version.

Agreed.
