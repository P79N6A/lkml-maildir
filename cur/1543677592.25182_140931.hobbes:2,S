Hello,
This release fixes some bugs and adds support for raid 0+1. I have also 
done some minor code clean-ups.
Changelog since 0.01-ww1:
=========================
* correct values of raid-1 superbock
* check for availability of all disks
* fixup for raid-1 disknumbering
* do _NOT_ align size to 255*63 boundary
* raid 0+1 support
* bump version number
* release no more devices than available on unload
* remove static variables in raid-1 read path
Notes:
======
I raid 1 and raid 0+1 does not provide support for redundancy. It just 
adds a compatibility layer to support the HPT37X raid volumes.
As far as I can tell, the new raid 0+1 implementation of the HPT374 
(BIOS 3.X) is not supported. The same controller also has raid 5. But 
due to lack of hardware I cannot implement these (Unless I can persuade 
a friend of mine to trash his windows installation.).
Any comments are welcome...
Bye,
Wilfried
