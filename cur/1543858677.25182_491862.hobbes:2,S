i still dont quite get it - and i feel deja vu. Didnt we agree that the 
right way to go about this is to validate all stack information based on 
what the kernel already knows about all the stacks that the task may 
use? I.e. only allow pointers into the kernel stack and into the various 
kernel stacks. No 'probe kernel pointer' or anything. If the unwind data 
or register state ever points outside that basic filter, abandon the 
walk. Am i missing something?
