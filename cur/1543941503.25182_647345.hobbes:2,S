yes but the early hang is very real so either my hardware is stubbornly 
ignoring that your patch is pure code movement (in which case i'll have 
to have a word or two with my hardware), or your patch is perhaps wrong 
somewhere ;-)
generally you can protect yourself against full reverts by separating 
the NOP changes from the non-NOP changes. If a change is small enough i 
might spot the bug immediately and fix it - otherwise i have to undo 
your whole series to keep the x86.git ball rolling. I thought we went 
through this excercise a few times already :-/ ...
