There was a previous thread on this, last month.
I updated to 2.6.6 and I still get these random lockups. Nothing in 
dmesg or /var/log/messages. Too annoying as I have to reboot the machine 
constantly. Does anyone know the status on this? Is t a toshiba hardware 
bug (is that possible?) or a bug in serio.c or keybd.c?
Thanks!
