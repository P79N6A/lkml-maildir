Ok. That _is_ indeed a big clue.
Does the -ac patches have any hpt366-specific stuff? Although I suspect

very very sensitive to some random alignment of stars, rather than any
real code itself.

So it actually slows down to just 1.5MB/s at times? That's just
disgusting. I wonder what the driver is doing..
