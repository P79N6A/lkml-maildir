I think it's happening down inside the old linuxthreads library.  No idea
who, what, where or why.
There are quite a few places in the kernel which do it, too.  Usually when
waiting for memory to come free.  These are being gradually removed, in
favour of blk_congestion_wait() calls.
That leaves behind the very performance-critical sched_yield() in ext3
transaction batching.  That was designed to allow other processes to join a
transaction before the calling one closes the transaction.  With the new
yield() it was causing horrid starvation and was lamely replaced with a
schedule().  It needs to be resurrected for real, but I'm not sure how. 
Probably just a sleep(0.01).
