The problem.  There is no upper bound to how many rmap
entries there can be at one time.  And the unbounded
growth can overwhelm a machine.
The goal is to provide an overall system cap on the number
of rmap entries.

Unless something has changed for nonlinear vmas, and anonymous
memory we have been storing enough information to recover
the page in the page tables for ages.  
For mlock we want a cap on the number of pages that are locked,
so it should not be a problem.  But even then we don't have to
guarantee the page is constantly in the processes page table, simply
that the mlocked page is never swapped out.

Cost?  What Cost?
The simple implementation is to walk the page lists and unmap 
the pages that are least likely to be used next.
This is not something new.  We have been doing this in 2.4.x and
before for years.  Before it just never freed up rmap entries, as well
as preparing a page to be paged out.
