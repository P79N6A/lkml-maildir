Thanks for looking into this.
I tried the tty and got the following messages in continuous loop (they 
were scrolling past real fast but since there were only two messages 
they kind of overlapped so I could write them down)
ide : failed opcode was : unknown
hdc : status error: status 0x00 { }
Is there anything else that I can provide?
