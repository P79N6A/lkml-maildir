To be fair, I should point out that my original patch made the second
argument a pointer, so that the kernel could return the actual length of
the mask if it were too small.  This would move the interface from
"flawed hack" to "not too bad".  ;-)
Anyhow, Linus said that the interface was stupid and the second
parameter should not be a pointer.  So, if we are gonna blame
someone... :)
