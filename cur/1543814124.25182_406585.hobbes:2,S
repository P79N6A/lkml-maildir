How about this the attached adjustment?

 Read and write memory barriers give similar guarantees, but only for memory
 reads versus memory reads and memory writes versus memory writes respectively.
 
+Data dependency memory barriers ensure that if two reads are issued that

 All memory barriers imply compiler barriers.
 
 SMP memory barriers are only compiler barriers on uniprocessor compiled systems
