That's the local APIC timer. Pretty much all modern x86 have it.
But at least microsoft warns from using them for high precision 
tim ekeeping on their mmtimer page "due to inaccuracy and 
frequent silicon bugs" (and I guess they have the data for that) 
For scheduling and time accounting it seems to work reasonably though,
even though I've had some problems with inaccuracies (e.g. when you
instrument both 8254 and apic timer and log the TSCs there are sometimes
drifts) 
The linux local APIC timer setup could be probably also improved, for 
example the 16 multiplier is a bit dubious and the calibration does not
look very robust.

mmtimers? They are in the chipset, not in the CPU. 
They are in some modern Intel and AMD chipsets already for example and 
Microsoft is pushing them too so I guess they will be soon in all new 
chipsets.
