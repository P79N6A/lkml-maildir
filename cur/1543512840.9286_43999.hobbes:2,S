No, i meant what i said above. While returning from
sched_yield() the current SCHED_OTHER thread will be treated
just like if it had current->counter==0.

You need it if a RT task might require another thread to make
some progress, otherwise you could deadlock. 
[note that the schedule_others implementaion could be better,
but i wanted to have something that at least works, isn't
spread out all over the kernel sources, and is safe and easy
to update. I implemented it the way i did exactly because i
didn't want to make schedule() any more complex .]

it could be needed again, it's an inline so it does no harm.

"decides switching to CPU 1 is too expensive" does not happen when CPU1
is idle. see wake_up_process()/reschedule_idle().
