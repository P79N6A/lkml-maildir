I grepped for the output in that badly truncated logfile and skge hit.

I meant 64bit DMA, aka double address cycle, not a 64bit wide PCI-X bus.
That works on a 32bit PCI bus too. On modern boards it's likely PCI
Express anyways for on board devices.

64bit PCI-X bus has nothing to do with the addressing capability. It
just gives you more bandwidth.
