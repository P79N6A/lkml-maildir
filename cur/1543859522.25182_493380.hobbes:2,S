This should _only_ be a valid thing to do when we're removing the page 
from a mapping anyway, so I'd most definitely hope that the code 
immediately after (or before) will have done a "remove_from_page_cache()"
In which case the tags should not matter.
There is _no_ excuse for cancelling a page and leaving it in the page 
cache that I can see. Because your page contents will be _indeterminate_.

So with my change, afaik, we will just return EIO to the invalidate, and 
do the write. Which should be ok. In fact, it appears to be the only 
possibly valid thing to do.
It really boils down to that same thing: if you remove the dirty bit, 
there is NO CONCEIVABLE GOOD THING YOU CAN DO EXCEPT FOR:
 - do the damn IO already ("clear_page_dirty_for_io()")
 - truncate the page (unmap and destroy it both from page cache AND from 
   any user-visible filesystem cases)
Anything else is simpyl a bug. Always has been. My patch just makes that 
very clear.

People will now get -EIO where they used to get an inconsistent system 
image. I really think it sounds like an improvement.
