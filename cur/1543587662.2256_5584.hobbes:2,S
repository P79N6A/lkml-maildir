Hi.
I hope this is the correct place to report to.
I have installed kernel 2.4.3 but my system is having a few problems
compiling things. Not all software is having problems it just seems to
be the most important ones. like mozilla or alsa-driver, I would like to
try others to test this but it's kind of frustrating and time consuming.
I installed the kernel in /usr/local/src because the install file says
not to do it in /usr/src anymore because of kernel header dependencies.
The system is booting and obviously I can use the net but the main
problem seems toi be that a lot of important files have not benn updated
or relinked to the right dir.
I installed the new kernel onto Mandrake 7.0 which ships with 2.2.14.
I'm using a PIII
and have verified that my software is upto the minimal requirements
according to the /documentation/changes file. All except mkinitrd which
I can't install becuse I have an old version of rpm and cannot find the
tar.gz file on the net.
An example of what my system is doing:
I compile the latest stable mozilla.
First off it complains that /usr/include/bits/errno.h doesn't point to
the right place.
So I remove it and link /usr/local/src/linux/include/asm/errno.h to
/usr/include/bits/errno.h and recompile.
It gets past that point then complains about /usr/include/bits/socket.h
so I repeat the process.
The futility of doing this occurs to me. So I write in to this list in
the hope that someone may know what I have done wrong or can offer me
some help to debug.
Any ideas?
Patrick Shirkey.
