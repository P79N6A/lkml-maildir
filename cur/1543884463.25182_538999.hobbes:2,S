As a quick hack, sure.  But every ARCH_USES_SLAB_PAGE_STRUCT
diminishes the testing SLUB will get.  If the idea is that we're
going to support both SLAB and SLUB, some arches with one, some
with another, some with either, for more than a single release,
then I'm back to saying SLUB is being pushed in too early.
I can understand people wanting pluggable schedulers,
but pluggable slab allocators?
