Hi,
Linus, this looks disturbingly familiar.

I spent some time debugging a box with Doug Ledford and Mike Wangsmo.
They were able to reproduce buffer_head corruptions (specifically,
bh->b_next pointing to crap) during redhat installs, although the
machine worked perfectly once installed.  We eventually narrowed it down
to what looked like a BIOS32 problem (although not APM in this case): it
appears that the BIOS32 was playing with page tables and failing to
invalidate the TLB on return.  We did manage to come up with a modified
debugging kernel in which a single tlb_flush_all() after PCI setup was
sufficient, and necessary, to eliminate the symptoms.
There are some obvious workarounds for this sort of problem, but they
are all gross.  (Incidentally, booting "mem=16m" also proved to be a
sufficient workaround in our particular case.)  
Just another data point you may find useful.  I really don't think the
problem was in Linux in the case we investigated.
