I'd like to add the context-switch accounting to the taskstats payload.
As we'd then need to uprev the taskstats payload and version it makes sense
to have a look around, see if there's anything else which should be in
there but got missed.
I don't think we can accept the number-of-syscalls accounting feature.  It
adds a memory increment into the kernel's number-one hotpath.  Something
which people like to obsessively microbenchmark.
And as I said earlier, a 32-bit counter can be overflowed in mere seconds,
so that needs to become 64-bit, in which case we add a memory increment and
a test-n-branch to that hottest path.
There _is_ some cumulative overhead here, and I don't see how the value of
the syscall counter can justify it.
