The i810 bits would be a failure case of the original slabification.
At first glance the re-slabification doesn't seem to conflict with the
unmapping-based slab poisoning.
In another thread, you mentioned that a certain netfilter cset had
issues; I think it might be good to add that as a second possible cause.
I'm trying to track down testers with i810's to reproduce the issue,
but the usual suspects and helpers aren't awake yet (most/all of my
target systems are headless, though I regularly abuse my laptop, which
appears to S3/Savage -based and so isn't useful for this).
