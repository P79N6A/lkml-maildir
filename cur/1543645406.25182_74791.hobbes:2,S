   what is wrong with the PCI DMA API that makes ALSA wants a private
   interface/implementation ?
It makes the layers not have to know what the BUS is, and this can all
be deleted when everything goes through a generic struct device and
assosciated OPS.
I think ALSA is definitely doing the right thing here.
