Hello,
This e-mail is offtopic but is related to the networking
code. I am working on an inet daemon that listens for tcp
connections and passes the descriptor returned by listen to
a child program to handle. It turns out that many child
programs error during startup and exit without accepting
the connection (linuxconf is one of them). The daemon that
listens sees the descriptor as readable and starts a new
child. This can loop forever.
The question is how can a parent process reliably determine
that its child has accepted the connection? Also, is it
possible to tell anything about a connection that has
returned from listen but not yet accepted? For instance the
source IP address?
Thanks,
Steve Grubb
