I strongly object against using /proc hooks to get virtualization-like
solution.
You endup with lots of hooks and unmaintainable code.
Also though it works find with a small subset of /proc and sysctl, it
works poorly with dynamic trees, as the same entries can be
created in container, though they already exist in host. e.g. network
device names.
Thanks,
