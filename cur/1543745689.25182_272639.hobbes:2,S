When I disabled DEBUG_SPINLOCK, it works fine.  Does DEBUG_SPINLOCK have
any side effects?  I would have thought it wouldn't do anything on a UP,
non-PREEMPT system.
There is the comment in arch/i386/kernel/time.c saying that APM needs
get_cmos_time(), which is the site of the second message.  The code is
very simple, so its hard to see how this could be going wrong.  I'm
guessing, though, that this is a relatively untested path, since people
don't tend to use APM+SMP.

I've been using the eepro100 driver lately, which doesn't seem to have
this problem at all.
