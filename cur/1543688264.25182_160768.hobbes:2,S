I normally hate ifdefs but this might be a good place to use a bunch of 
macros and make them conditional on config_stats or something.  Updating
counters is going to add to the size of the data cache footprint and it
would be nice, for those people working on embedded low speed processors,
if they could config this out.  I personally would leave it in, I like
this stats.  I just know that the path to slowness is paved one cache
miss at a time.
