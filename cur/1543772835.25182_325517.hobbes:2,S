Please remove linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org from your mailing list. 
linux-kernel is itself a mailing list, and the Linux kernel is 
license-incompatible with OpenSolaris, so no code can be shared AFAIK.
Also, please fix your word wrap in your mailer.

http://see.sun.com/Apps/DCS/mcp?r=70043his4ElHi012000418NM043his0mRdwBRd7v&=1
 you will see hundreds of OpenSolaris engineering blogs from across Sun's engineering community explaining in detail the code they have written. The amount of technical content in these engineering blogs is impressive, and you can expect even more as we go. You can also find those blogs, as well as the pilot community blogs, at opensolaris.org. 
A blog is a poor tool for storing engineering knowledge.
A wiki would probably work better.
