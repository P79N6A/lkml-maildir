Definitly not 2. because I checked this with one guy, who has that problem
via a ISDN line. And from postings on our ISDN mailling lists, it seems
that this Problem wasn't in 2.2.5 but in >= 2.2.10.

It told ISDN people with this effect, to make such logs.
The guy where I checked the internal state of the isdn device driver, made
allready such logs, but I think he didn't stored it.
What he saw was:
Line slows down, a running ping (direct to the peer) freezed. He started
started tcpdump and a new ping, now he saw that with the new ping
also the missing packets from the old ping are seen in tcpdump, and also get
a quick response.
