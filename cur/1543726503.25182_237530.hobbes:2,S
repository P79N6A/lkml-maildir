this is the most important measure and what we are trying to improve.
We can hardly expect softirq's alone to give us the balance of load we wish. 
At overload something has to get less resources. Even we defer all softirq's 
to scheduler context there is no way making any distinguish between them 
unless we run them in separate processes i.e one RX_SOFIRQ, TX_SOFIRQ etc. 
This could solve some problem I just discussed with Jamal where the RX 
softirq overruns the TX softirq and causes drop at egress (qdisc) when bus 
BW is saturated. Running softirq's under schedules context's can cause other 
delays and other problems.
About tour test;
I dunno if the absolute values are comparable but we see a some change 
in behavior. I use your two last lines from your test assuming these
are the highest loaded

So most ksoftirq's runs most softirq's which is good. Without this you would 
not be able to type any commands at all. Also we see some effects from the 
path. Can you monitor userland starvation here too?

This OK as we have to throttle.

Good.

Well ksoftirqd now runs RX softirq and competes heavily with other processes 
for your CPU you may have to adjust priorities to get your desired balance.
Can you experiment a bit?

Well it's not only a network issue.
Cheers.
