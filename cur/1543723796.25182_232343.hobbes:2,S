The kernel's kallsyms feature does, roughly, this:
- generate vmlinux
- generate a list of symbols from it
- turn those symbols into a C array
- generate a new vmlinux which includes that C array
All this assumes that the symbols in the fist and second vmlinux's fall at
the same addresses.  But for some reason, that doesn't always happen.  End
result: the second vmlinux's kallsyms info is wrong.  It's not clear why
the linker does this.
The third kallsyms pass will generate a list of symbols from the vmlinux+C
array and will again generate a vmlinux+C array.  It turns out that this is
stable.
