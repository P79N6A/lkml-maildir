No, like Pavel's and Martin's reports, this is just an effect
of the not-quite-fully-baked do_wp_page/get_user_pages race fix in
2.6.13-rc5-git2, which AlexN reported earlier.  Should now be fully
fixed in Linus' current git, and in the 2.6.13-rc6 akpm prophesies
to be coming soon - please all test that.
