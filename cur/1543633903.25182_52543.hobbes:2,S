To repeat, pci_enable_device is not _just_ resource assignment.
It also provides:
1) power state management (wakes up the device)
2) an entry point which guarantees the bus layer that the driver is not 
interested in the hardware at all before that point.  Or IOW, 
pci_enable_device is a bus layer hook for whatever "device 
wakeup/appearing" needs that bus has.  Sure, we are talking about moving 
some of that functionality to other functions (pci_request_<foo>), but 
that doesn't mean we should ditch the hook altogether.
Remember, we have a matching pair here:  pci_enable_device, 
pci_disable_device.  Update the code that goes on between those two 
calls, sure.  But leave the calls there.

That seems like a decent enough API, pending a bit of driver conversion 
to see how well it works out in practice.  So I'm ok with it (with the 
pci_enable_device proviso, above)
