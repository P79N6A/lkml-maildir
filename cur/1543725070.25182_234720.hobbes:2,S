	Andy, I never said that, please quote me accurately. I
personally don't have strong opinions on whether those drivers should
be tagged with CONFIG_ISA or not, but those hardware are definitely
mapped on the ISA bus.
	Also, I just had a report of an user having a problem with the
removal of isa_virt_to_bus on x86-64 :
		
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3073
	Depending on how this bug pans out, we *may* have to revert
the patch and brings back isa_virt_to_bus.
	Regards,
	Jean
