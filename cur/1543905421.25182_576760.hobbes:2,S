Hello,
I have four identical machines, based on Supermicro X7DBE motherboards.
All of the machines have two Xeon 5130 CPUs, 16GB RAM and two add-on
cards: an Areca 1261 SATA RAID HBA and a Qlogic QLA2342 fibre channel HBA.
I would like to use these as file servers (via FC), but during the 
performance and
reliabilty tests it turned out that the machines are very unreliable, 
despite that they
seemed to be OK hardware-wise (memtest and the usual stuff).
During the debugging of this (seemingly) high IO load related problem, I 
have
observed the following:
- when MSI is enabled (the first iteration), the machines sometimes 
"hang", but
not the whole system, just the SCSI target subsystem (SCST), which makes
heavy IO on the Areca (arcmsr) and the Qlogic (patched qla2xxx) HBAs
- when MSI is disabled, I couldn't reproduce that hung up state, instead the
machines sometimes throw an MCE (see below), but I couldn't find its cause
- when MSI is disabled, and CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ is enabled, the machines
can't even boot normally, I get an oops instantly during the kernel 
initialization
- with MSI disabled sometimes the machines fail to respond, the ssh 
sessions terminate
and on the console I can't type for very long seconds. I have nearly all 
debugging turned on,
but can't see anything in the logs or on the console. The machine 
recovers from this hang
automatically. The whole thing seems like when a high (eg. network) 
interrupt activity happens
on a highly loaded machine, but I could observe this even after a fresh 
boot, without anything
(of course minus the standard stuff, sshd, and the others) running on 
the machine.
The kernel is 2.6.21.5 (I've tried 2.6.18, the effects are the same), 
running in 64 bit mode.
The oops I get with MSI disabled and CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ enabled:

[153104.732365] Kernel panic - not syncing: Machine check
I've got exactly the same errors (only the TSC and the CPU value 
changing) on all four machines,
could this really be a hardware error?
full dmesg: 
http://people.fsn.hu/~bra/linux/x7dbe-20070730/with_debug_shirq
dmesg with MSI enabled: 
http://people.fsn.hu/~bra/linux/x7dbe-20070730/with_msi_and_debug_shirq
kernel config: 
http://people.fsn.hu/~bra/linux/x7dbe-20070730/config
I've tried to disable all possible devices which consume interrupts,
and placed the cards into various slots (the FC HBA is PCI-X, which the 
Areca
is PCI-E). Currently the arcmsr and (one of, it's a dual channel
HBA) qla2xxx are on a shared IRQ.
Could you please help?
Do you think this is related to the strange hang under high IO load, the
occasional, complete "blackouts", where all ssh network sessions
time out, but the machine recovers, and the MCEs?
I'm open for anything, have serial consoles, etc, if needed.
Please keep me on CC, I'm not subscribed.
Thanks,
