Sorry, my answer above was wrong.  In Nicholas's particular case there was
no DMA transfer at all, only memcpy().  There are other cases that do use
DMA, of course, like the one you were looking at.

Okay.  The real trouble we're facing is that the driver is handed an sg 
list, but sometimes it has to copy data directly to/from the memory area 
(via memcpy() for example) rather than doing I/O -- and even when doing 
I/O it may sometimes have to use PIO rather than DMA.
Anyway, we have to be able to access the underlying memory for the sg 
buffer.  The code currently uses
	page_address(sg[i].page) + sg[i].offset
to do this.  Is this now wrong?  And if so, what should it use instead?
I don't see anything about it in DMA-mapping.txt.

Certainly the 2.4 ifdefs can go away now.  We use kmalloc() rather than
alloc_page() because we will have to examine the allocated memory after
the DMA operation is complete.

They are mapped in drivers/usb/core/usb.c:usb_buffer_map_sg().  I don't 
know what buffers you're referring to.

I'll change it.  But first we better settle the other questions I asked 
above.

You mean, why does page_address() return 0 if ->page is set?  I don't
know.  In fact, it's not even certain that ->page _is_ set -- I didn't
think to print it out in the diagnostic patch.
In any case, it quite likely _does_ point to a driver bug.  But since
sddr09_read_data() was handed this sg entry and didn't change it, if there
is such a bug it must lie in a higher-level driver.  Maybe the scsi layer, 
maybe the block layer, maybe the memory-management system, maybe the file 
system.  That was my original point.
