Yep, these two APIs are only part of the solution.
The reference-count approach is only guaranteed to work if the kernel
thread that did the reference-count increment is later referencing that
same data element.  Otherwise, one has the following possible situation
on DEC Alpha:
o	CPU 0 initializes and inserts a new element into the data
	structure, using rcu_assign_pointer() to provide any needed
	memory barriers.  (Or, if RCU is not being used, under the
	appropriate update-side lock.)
o	CPU 1 acquires a reference to this new element, presumably
	using either a lock or rcu_read_lock() and rcu_dereference()
	in order to do so safely.  CPU 1 then increments the reference
	count.
o	CPU 2 picks up a pointer to this new element, but in a way
	that relies on the reference count having been incremented,
	without using locking, rcu_read_lock(), rcu_dereference(),
	and so on.
	This CPU can then see the pre-initialized contents of the
	newly inserted data structure (again, but only on DEC Alpha).
Again, if the same kernel thread that incremented the reference count
is later accessing it, no problem, even on Alpha.
