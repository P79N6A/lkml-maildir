Subject: 2.4.3-ac6 config options with no Configure.help text.

As of kernel 2.4.3-ac6, there are 575 config options which have no help text in Configure.help.
Here is a list of these items which have been introduced recently, after 2.4.3-ac1.
Each group is incremental, versus 2.4.3-ac[n-1].
If you see one of your options here, please consider generating a patch for Configure.help,
or send me the information and I'll do the rest.
A status of "acknowledged" means that the item is being worked on by the person named or
their designate or the patch has been submitted but hasn't yet appeared in an -ac release.  
Thank you to the maintainers who have responded.
Thanks in advance,
Steven
