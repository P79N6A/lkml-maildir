This is not an authoritive answer but:
	It's simple, and fast. Locks only needed when adding/removing
	entries.
It is also nearly optimum when the queue only has 5 (or so) number of
entries. It will not be optimum if there are 32/64 CPUs with 120 or more
runnable entries. There are other schedulers available that may do a
better job for that situation.
