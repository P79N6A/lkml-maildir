	this sounds very like it works on amiga systems: floppies are
mounted 
	with their given "name" and they stay mounted and "accessible"
regardless 
	they are ejected.
	e.g. a "cd" to a directory on the floppy would cause the system to
bring
	up a message like "plz insert disk xxx:".
	in old days, without any harddisk, one usually worked as a
diskjockey on 
	the request of the system.
	at that time it was sometimes terrible but the only way, because
even 
	the main part of os was on one of the floppies. benefit:
accidentally ejecting 
	a floppy didn't necessarily destroy it unless you ignore the system
messages.
