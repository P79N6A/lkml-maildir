The 2.5.X version is broken. Instead I have beening working on making
the fbdev layer stable. The api I developed while working on ruby. The 
2.4.X version is quite stable. Alot of the framebuffer drivers could be 
dropped onto the 2.4.X ruby kernel and it would work. We do have a few 
changes in the framebuffer api that happened but that wouldn't take much 
to port to ruby 2.4.X.

No. I'm still working on ruby. All my 2.5.X is geared toward ruby.
