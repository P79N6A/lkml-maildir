That was happening to me yesterday as well.  After a bit
of poking around and recompiling, it mysteriously went away.
The same has happened about ten times over the past few months,
and rebuilding the world makes it go away.  On ext3.
Something is definitely fishy.  It's unhelpful that it cures
itself just as you get geared up to fix it.
Does a full rebuild fix it for you?
