It means that the ACPI PCI Routing Table (_PRT)
did not have an entry for this PCI device.
This is very common for IDE, which
can't decide if it is a real PCI device
or a legacy device; and the driver
is hard-coded to IRQ14, 15 anyway.
Linux is actually sort of exposed
WRT motherboard devices, because
while Linux/ACPI finds the PCI
resources, it doesn't look for
the legacy resource, which
is where on this board IDE lives.
