The motherboard has plenty of expansion slots and is SLI-enabled, so
the hardware should support multiple graphics cards. I personally
havent tried this, but perhaps someone on the LinuxBIOS mailinglist
(CCed) has had experience with such a setup.
BTW: An OpenGraphics card (
http://OpenGraphics.org
 ,
http://TraversalTech.com
) will be released pretty soon that will be
fully documented and that will come with an open-source VGA video
BIOS.
