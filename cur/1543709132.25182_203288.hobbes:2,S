It might be nice to have the same thing as the initcalls:
#define core_initcall(fn)               __define_initcall("1",fn)
...
#define late_initcall(fn)               __define_initcall("7",fn)
If we had something like this, we could also use it for stuff like
early_printk(), in addition to things like mem= in setup_arch().  You
can actually do serial early printk in about 3 lines of code if you can
parse arguments really, really early.
