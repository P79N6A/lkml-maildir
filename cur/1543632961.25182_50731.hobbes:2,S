You say you read the page. ... Hey, wait a moment!
There are TWO files. /etc/modules.conf, that defines how to load modules
when they are requested (default parameters), which modules to load on
kernel request (autoloading) etc. And then there is another file -
/etc/modules, that is simply processed like
for each line do modprobe <the line>
during boot process.
So depending on what kind of module you have. If it's a module for some
device, you can make the alias in modules.conf and kernel will ask for
it when it's needed. It also works for some special cases (like iptables
- they don't even need an alias). For other things, especially network
device drivers you need to load them from /etc/modules
Note: ALL config files on unix are made so that they can be edited by
hand using eny editor.
