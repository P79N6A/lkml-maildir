And modules do work like you proposed, if you use "rmmod --wait".
Doing proper refcounting is actually fairly easy: every function pointer
has an associated reference count (or pointer to the module containing
the refcount).
But how much pain are you prepared to put up with to have a pseudo-pagable
kernel?

Actually, this is already handled.  The module reference counts are per-cpu
and don't contain any barriers.  We go to an *awful* lot of pain on remove
to synchronize, but as Linus says, it's not the normal case.
Since we hit the (atomic_t) ref to the devices on every packet, bumping
the refcount on the module is lost in the noise.
But Dave doesn't want to do it: it makes the code uglier and painful.
Cheers,
Rusty.
