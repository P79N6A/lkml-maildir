I think so too.
I played with some numbers inside sched.c.  Raising the MIN_TIMESLICE from 1 
to between 10-100  affects interactivity positively, although it does not 
fix it entirely.
It does look like there is an underlying problem (locking?) that may be 
worked-around by tuning the scheduler to some extent.
Also, MAX_TIMESLICE = 800 seems a bit high.  Can this be lowered?
Thanks!
