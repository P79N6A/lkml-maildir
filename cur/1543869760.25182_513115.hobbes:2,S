Hello,
[since I got no reply in linux-scsi, I'll try here]
Is GFP_DMA really needed in sd_revalidate_disk() in every circumstances?
That's the code:
    buffer = kmalloc(SD_BUF_SIZE, GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_DMA);
    if (!buffer) {
        printk(KERN_WARNING "(sd_revalidate_disk:) Memory allocation "
               "failure.\n");
        goto out;
    }
Or should could the check (sdp->host->unchecked_isa_dma ? __GFP_DMA : 0)
applied here, too?
Thanks!
Regards,
Bernhard
