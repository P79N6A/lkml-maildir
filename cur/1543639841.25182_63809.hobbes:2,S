8139too has been tested on big-endian and little-endian, 32-bit and 
64-bit processors without showing the behavior you're seeing.
If the packet is fine in rtl8139_start_xmit, it sounds like a hardware 
problem.  There is certainly the possibility that your platform is 
interacting poorly in some way with the driver, but that's a slim 
possibility.  There's no way to know more without you doing some testing 
and experimentation yourself.
