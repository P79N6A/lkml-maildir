Well, compared to ASCII: it's unlikely that you meet a j letter or a \033 
in the size string.
I intended something such as GMP. We'd neet special maths functions for 
this crap then, of course, but it might be worth it. The basics is just 
"If field[n] overflows, push the overhead into field[n+1]"...
But you're of course right here that endianness is an issue here.
