Another possibility is to not give the 1 "extra" tick to
niced processes all the time.
#define NICE_TO_TICKS(nice)    ((((20)-(nice)) >> (LOG2_HZ-5))+1)
If we make the "+1" a conditional thing, which is only given to
processes every ((20)-(nice) / nice) times - or even less - we
can have larger, maybe even tunable, differences between niced
tasks...
