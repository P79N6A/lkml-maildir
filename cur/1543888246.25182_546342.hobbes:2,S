Hi Tomas,
unfortunately, I can hardly accept such a patch to go into mainline, 
sorry. If the device has only Telephony/Headset application and no other 
input-compatible usage, we just can't blindly pass it exclusively to 
hid-input subsystem.

But all this is handled actually by userspace applications, right? Or do 
you want this whole functionality to go into a specialized kernel driver? 
Or does this require some interaction/processing between hardware and the 
driver?

Well, if the only purpose of this device is to pass status of pressed 
buttons into userspace driver (which is the case, as far as I understand 
it), it's just broken that it has 05 0b (i.e. Telephony/Headset) in its 
report descriptor.
Either fixing the report descriptor on the fly or adding a special quirk 
to force hid-input to claim the device would be needed. Would you care to 
create such patch?
Or did I just get it wrong and the device has also other purposes that 
should be handled by the kernel driver, than just trivial mapping of a few 
buttons into corresponding input events?
Thanks,
