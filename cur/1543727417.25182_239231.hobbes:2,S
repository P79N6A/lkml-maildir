Quoting said document:
  7) E-mail size.
  When sending patches to Linus, always follow step #6.
  Large changes are not appropriate for mailing lists, and some
  maintainers.  If your patch, uncompressed, exceeds 40 kB in size,
  it is preferred that you store your patch on an Internet-accessible
  server, and provide instead a URL (link) pointing to your patch.
A few of the patches at that URL are very large (one is over 400k).  That 
said, some of the others could probably be posted.
