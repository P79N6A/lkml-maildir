You'd still stat() the file to decide whether to use sendpath() to
send it or not, if it was Last-Modified: etc. Of course, you'd cache
stat() calls too for a few seconds. The main thing is that you save
a valuable fd and open() is expensive, even more so than stat().

Agreed -- the hard-coded Nagle algorithm makes no sense these days.

Hmmm, there's a place for userland httpds that are within a few
percent of kernel ones (like Zeus is, when I last looked). But I
agree, hybrid approaches will become more common, although the trend
towards server-side dynamic pages negate this. A kernel approach is a
definite win if you're used to using a limited-scalability userland
httpd like Apache.
