My official opinion (for net drivers and ATA at least):  It is pointless 
having such a check in the hottest of driver hot paths, since a large 
majority of drivers do not have such a check.
It is better to fix the extremely rare oddball that passes NULL to 
request_irq(), than to update all drivers to be slower due to the oddballs.
