just use a view, and skip the options on the system calls.  if you cd to 
/nometas/your_home_directory_path you don't see the metafiles.  Why is a 
view better than a syscall flag?  Because it lets the user choose what 
he wants without recompiling to do it.  This kind of a view requires no 
coding because you can just mount the root filesystem two ways, one with 
the -nopseudos mount option, and one without it.
