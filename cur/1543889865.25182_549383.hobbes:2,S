You saw my quirk that enabled MSI if you happen to have a
hypertransport msi mapping capability.  That should take care of
all hypertransport compliant AMD chipsets.
So at least 90% of what we have now should work.

A little.  It is redefining the problem as squarely a BIOS writers
problem and possibly we want to do that in the presence of pci-express.

Non-x86 (unless I'm confused) already has white lists or some
equivalent because they can't use generic code for configuring MSI
because non-x86 does not have a standard MSI target window with a
standard meaning for the bits.  So non-x86 has it's own set of arch
specific mechanisms to handle this, and they just don't want generic
code getting in the way.
So it may makes sense make the default all to be x86 specific.

I haven't a clue.  I know we are in we are in the teething pain stage
now which just generally makes things difficult.

Possibly.  It just doesn't seem straight forward to add something
safely to our blacklist.

A reasonable goal.  I will come back to this after the long holiday
weekend here and see what makes sense.
I think for most of Intel I can reduce my test to:
If (bus == 0 , device == 0, function == 0 && vendor == Intel &&
    has a pci express capability) {
	Enable msi on all busses().
}
At which point I don't think we will need to do much maintenance.
