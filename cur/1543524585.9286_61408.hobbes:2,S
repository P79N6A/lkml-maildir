Hello,
Sorry for that little off topic question, but it seems that rpc.mountd (RH 6.1,
knfsd) has some memory leak.
After a few days, its size is around 30Mo on my machine. The fact is that we are
using automount
on the clients, and the server is receiving many mount/umount commands during
the its life.
I have not the exact figures, but I estimate the mount/umount commands to be
around 100+
every day.
A+,
