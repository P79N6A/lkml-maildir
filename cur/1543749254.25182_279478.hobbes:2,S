Yes, the real reason of my changes are quite unrelated to this bug: i.e.
we to keep mapcount zero for all pages with page->mapping = NULL so they
don't even enter objrmap.c, and to enforce other nice bits like that
page-reserved must have page->mapping = NULL and other VM_RESERVED
related enforcements. It wasn't meant to hide bugs and infact we should
remove anything that that hides real bugs if my changes are truly hiding
them. I still don't excude they're a real fix though, the fact I can't
tell the exact reason why they help doesn't mean they're not fixing the
real bug (there's quite some code in objrmap.c that definitely should
not be involved with non-pageable pages, and my patch enforces this,
unlike mainline).
Infact if a page becomes suddenly unreserved, shouldn't the accounting
break anyways at the page->count level? The page would be freed twice
instead of once.
I wonder if the sg_cleanup explains why some mapped reserved page
suddenly become unreserved. Can you track if the DRM_IOCTL_SG_FREE is
being called in a mapped vma? I guess you could start by enabling
DRM(flags) in drm_init.h.
#if 0
int DRM(flags) = DRM_FLAG_DEBUG;
#else
int DRM(flags) = 0;
#endif
(set to 1 and then it should print something)
