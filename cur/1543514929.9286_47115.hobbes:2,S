I thought you all might want to know:
Almost all Linux kernels today are infringing on US patent #5,806,063 
The infringing code is in linux/arch/i386/kernel/time.c:get_cmos_time.
It deals with using 'windowing' to convert non-y2k-ok dates into 4 digit
dates.

'McDonnell+Douglas'&s2='year+2000'&OS='McDonnell+Douglas'+AND+'year+2000'&RS='McDonnell+Douglas'+AND+'year+2000')
Nevermind the fact that Linux had this code more then a year before the
patent was applied for. :)
How does the GPL look opon this, can I still distribute Linux since I
dont agree with the patent? If I (as say a linux distro) license the
patent (to cover my ass) could I still distribute Linux?
Could we somehow use this to make McDonnell Douglas Corporation (patent
holder) remove all their Linux? :) :) :)
