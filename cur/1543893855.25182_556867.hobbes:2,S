I see the smiley, but I hate it how the FSF thinks others are morons and 
cannot read or think for themselves.
Any time you disagree with the FSF, you "misunderstand" (insert 
condescending voice) the issue. 
_Please_ don't continue that idiocy. Disagreement and thinking that the 
FSF is controlling and putting its fingers where they don't belong is 
_not_ misunderstanding. It's just not "blind and unquestioning obedience".
