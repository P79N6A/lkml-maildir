I doubt it, we are talking one value per file here.  I can't see any USB
driver wanting to go over 4Kb for 1 value (and if it does, I'll change
it :)

Bandwidth is a good one.
Current config and altsetting might be useful.

No, I'll say that we need to stay one physical device per device in the
tree.  If you want to do an interface tree, let's put that in usbfs,
