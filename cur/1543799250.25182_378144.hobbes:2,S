As far as looking at the codes, it's OK for PCI.  PCI is initialized
in postcore, and the only device_initcall is for pci_init(), which
calls fixup for each PCI device.  This is no problem because fixup is
called in pci_enable(), too.
But for other subsystems like ISA PnP, it may be broken since some
codes are still using module_init().
(And, interestingly, fs_initcall() is rarely used in the whole fs/
 codes!  "grep -r fs_initcall linux/fs" hits only one file.)
So, a "safe" solution for the time being appears to be either
- to look through the whole codes and adjust *_initcall() levels,
- to force to build saa7134-alsa as a module, or
- to move saa7134-alsa.c to sound/ directory.

Yep.  The driver must work both for modules and built-in.  If it
doesn't work, it's called a bug, as we all know :)
