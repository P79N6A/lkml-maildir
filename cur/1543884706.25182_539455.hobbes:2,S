No, the reason for s390 is that we don't get any notification if
a new cpu gets attached, if running under z/VM (a hypervisor).
But since the cpuX/online attribute must exist to bring a cpu
online, the idea was to create the directories for all possible
cpus and if somebody tries to online a cpu the code will scan
for present and unused cpus and uses the first one...
Kind of stupid, but works.
