Nothing wrong with that.  It's the "relative to now" timeout argument
that is a bit racy, and the fact that you need a gettimeofday() system
call just before - every time - _purely_ to calculate the time until
the next application timer event.
If you must have a separate system call every time round your event
loop, it may as well set up a timerfd and let that be another pollable
descriptor.
In which case, read() is just fine for getting events :)
