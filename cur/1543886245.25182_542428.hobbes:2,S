If a short name can not be generated, then no OS could
create the file at all. The vfat and iso9660 filesystems require
short names. Any OS writing to such a filesystem MUST
generate short names in addition to any long names.
Mount your vfat as filesystem type "msdos" to see.
By default, Windows will also generate short names on NTFS.
Note that you can't put your files on a CD-ROM in a way
that Windows could read the filenames. Windows limits
CD-ROM filenames to 63 characters; you get at most 103
if you violate the spec.

It may be that tar fails to use the vfat ioctl calls to save
and restore short names. You could try using Wine to
run a Windows-native backup program. This shouldn't
really matter though; you'd only be getting short names
for files that had truly unreasonable long names anyway.
I suppose somebody should check to see if there is a
danger of overwrite when the short-named files get
written back. The safest thing might be to mount the
filesystem as type "msdos".

WTF? These names are too annoying to use, even if there
weren't this limit. Anything over about 29 characters is in
need of a rename. (that'd be 58 bytes for you, which is OK)
The limit is already 4 times larger than what is reasonable.
