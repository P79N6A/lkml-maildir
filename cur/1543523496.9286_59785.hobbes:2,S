Subject: Filesystem corruption on 2.3 kernels

Hello,
I've seen an already mentioned type of filesystem corruption on my box:
a block of data from a directory overwrote a file.
fsck didn't find any filesystem inconsistency.
The system is UP, kernel 2.3.33.
The directory data written over the file data contained just two
entries ("." and "..").  The most interesting thing is that the inode
number of "." entry was the same as the inode number of the overwritten
file.  ".." entry pointed to a directory in the bash source tree
compiled at that same time by another person.
I suppose that the reason the the corruption was the reordered write
operations when the directory was removed and the inode was reused.
Hope this helps,
