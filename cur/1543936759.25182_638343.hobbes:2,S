I don't know the history of those flags, but I wish they didn't exist.
They really look like warts in the PNP core code.  They're used so
infrequently and without obvious rationale, that it seems like it'd
be better if there were a way to deal with them inside the driver.
But to answer your question, I don't know enough to have an opinion
on whether DISABLE should include DO_NOT_CHANGE.

This had to do with the excessive warnings about exceeding the maximum
number of resources for a PNP device.  This should be resolved by Len's
patch here:

We all agree this is a stop-gap, and for 2.6.25, we need the real
solution of making PNP resources fully dynamic.
