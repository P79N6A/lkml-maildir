After hammering the system for a little more than an hour it gave up. I
don't have the serial logging setup yet because I haven't had time this
evening. I will be glad to do whatever I can to try to help debug this,
but it will have to wait until tomorrow. The log is here:

Sorry I forgot to mention that this was triggered running the 
stress-kernel package, minus the NFS-Compile, but it does include the 
CRASHME test. In addition, amlat was running as well. The system was 
pretty much 100% loaded.
