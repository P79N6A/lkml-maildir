There are a number of APIs that allow you to get the time:
- do_gettimeofday
  potentially slow, reliable TOD clock, microsecond resolution
- ktime_get_ts
  monotonic clock, nanosecond resolution
- getnstimeofday
  reliable, nanosecond TOD clock
- xtime
  jiffie accurate TOD clock, with fast reads
- xtime + wall_to_monotonic
  jiffie accurate monotonic clock, almost as fast
- get_cycles
  highest supported resolution and accuracy, highly
  HW-specific behaviour, may overflow.
