We have nothing to pin the pte page with if we're not holding the
mmap_sem.

Page still isn't pinned. You might be able to do something wild like
disable preemption and interrupts (to stop the TLB IPI) to get a pin
on the pte pages.
But even in that case, there is nothing in the mmu gather / tlb flush
interface that guarantees an architecture cannot free the page table
pages immediately (ie without waiting for the flush IPI). This would
make sense on architectures that don't walk the page tables in hardware.
Arjan, just to get an idea of your workload: obviously it is a mix of
read and write on the mmap_sem (read only will not really benefit from
reducing lock width because cacheline transfers will still be there).
Is it coming from brk() from the allocator? Someone told me a while ago
that glibc doesn't have a decent amount of hysteresis in its allocator
and tends to enter the kernel quite a lot... that might be something
to look into.
