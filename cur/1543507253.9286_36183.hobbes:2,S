 After using rsh to start 3 processes locally (rsh localhost) for a 
few times (anywhere from 10 runs to 50 runs), I get 
"poll: protocol failure in circuit setup", error messages and 
"localhost: connection refused" a short while after that.
 The 3 processes are started in a shell script one after another. This 
does not occur if I start only one process with rsh, and the other 2 with 
a normal invocation (just calling their names) at each run.
 I am using a standard 2.2.11 kernel.
 What could be wrong?
