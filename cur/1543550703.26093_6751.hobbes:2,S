Hi Jan! Hi Listies! :-)
 I tried it both: uhci and usb.uhci:
 Same behaviour for both: Boot into runlevel 2. do a cat on
 /dev/input/mouse0 and move the mouse: OK, some glibberish bytes 
 found their way onto the console.
 Start X
 Mouse cursor is frozen, but the device seems still be present, otherwise
 the X-Server would came back immediately with "no pointer device
 present" or something like that.
 Go back to the console
 An cat on the mouse dev again shows now the same behaviour: cat is 
 able to "see" the device but no byte garbage is produced while moving
 the mouse....
 
 Still all modules are alive, no oops, no log...
 Do I have to recompile the X-Server ???
 If I can help to isolate the problem, please tell me what to do...;-)
 Keep hacking!
 Meino
