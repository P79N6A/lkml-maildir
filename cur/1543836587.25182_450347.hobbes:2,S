Subject: [PATCH] enable VMSPLIT for highmem kernels
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I'll assume that the complete lack of commenting on this patch
mean that everyone agrees with me. :)  Time for -mm I guess.

The current VMSPLIT Kconfig option is disabled whenever highmem
is on.  This is a bit screwy because the people who need to
change VMSPLIT the most tend to be the ones *with* highmem and
constrained lowmem.
So, remove the highmem dependency.  But, re-include the
dependency for the "full 1GB of lowmem" option.  You can't have
the full 1GB of lowmem and highmem because of the need for the
vmalloc(), kmap(), etc... areas.
I thought there would be at least a bit of tweaking to do to
get it to work, but everything seems OK.
Boot tested on a 4GB x86 machine, and a 12GB 3-node NUMA-Q:
