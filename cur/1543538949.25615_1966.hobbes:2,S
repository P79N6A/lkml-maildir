Same thing with me. I took 2.4.0-test4 and compiled, everything went fine
and computer booted, but after I quit X first time everything was very dark
(not completely black!). I barely could see anything at the screen, but
computer still worked fine. I restarted X (without any tricks) and quit it.
Now it was totally black, but still responded to all user events... so I put
'shutdown -r now' and everything was fine after a moment :)
I have XFree 4.01 too, Asus V6600 (Geforce 256) with XFree 4.01 'nv' driver,
Asus P3C-E (i820) motherboard and some misc stuff (isdn, sb live,
aic-7850)...
3DFX DRM isn't compiled to kernel.
Could it be AGP or i820 issue?
