Subject: [PATCH 2.6.21-mm1]  remove unionfs reference to SLAB_CTOR_VERIFY
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

With unionfs included as a module, 2.6.21-mm1 build broke with:
fs/unionfs/super.c: In function ‘init_once’:
fs/unionfs/super.c:822: error: ‘SLAB_CTOR_VERIFY’ undeclared (first use in this function)
fs/unionfs/super.c:822: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only oncefs/unionfs/super.c:822: error: for each function it appears in.)
Looks like it missed the removal of SLAB_CTOR_VERIFY.  
This patch matches how the situation was addressed elsewhere
throughout the kernel.  Fixes the problem for me...
