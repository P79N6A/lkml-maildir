I just realized that this argument is bogus, because the user space tools
are probably, or at least potentially, built as 32 bit binaries, which
means that any interface using these _will_ break.
However, I could not find any actual user space interfaces in 2.6.22-rc
that are built around ioaddr_t. What are they, or have the been removed
by now?
