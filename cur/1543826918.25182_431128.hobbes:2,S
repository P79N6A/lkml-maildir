Have you tried using different cards/drivers? This might or might not be 
either a netconsole problem (generic) or driver related (which could impact 
other drivers too).
 From the top of my head I don't see any reason why the e1000 shouldn't handle 
the suspend event - but mind you that a fix for e1000/WoL impacting shutdown 
handlers was only recently added. Which kernels does this impact?
