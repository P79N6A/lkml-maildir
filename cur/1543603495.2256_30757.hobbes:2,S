In most cases, users write data by extending off the end of a file.
Only in a few cases (such as databases) do you ever write into the
middle of an existing file.  Even overwriting an existing file is done
by first truncating the file and then extending it again.
If you crash during such an extend, then the data blocks may have been
partially written, but the extend will not have been, so the
incompletely-written data blocks will not be part of any file.
The *only* way to get mis-ordered data blocks in ordered mode after a
crash is if you are overwriting in the middle of an existing file.  In
such a case there is no absolute guarantee about write ordering unless
you use fsync() or O_SYNC to force writes in a particular order.  
In journaled data mode, even mid-file overwrites will be strictly
ordered after a crash.
Cheers,
 Stephen
