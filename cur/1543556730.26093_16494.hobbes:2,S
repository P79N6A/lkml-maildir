Is there any way to measure (with microsecond accuracy) the time of a
program execution (without using Machine Specific Registers) ?
I've already tried getrusage(), times() and clock() but they all have
10 millisecond accuracy, even though they claim to have microsecond
acuracy.
The only thing that seems to work is to use one of the tools that measure
performanc through accessing the machine specific registers. They give you
the ability to measure the clock cycles used, but their accuracy is also
very low from what I have seen up to now.
Thank you very much in advance
