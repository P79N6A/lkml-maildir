It looks Christoph didn't use (direct)memory migration core in this set,
so memory-hotremove will not be affected by this.
At the first look, memory hotplugger will just replace swap_page()
with migrate_onepage().
Comparing swap-based migration and memory hotremove, memory hotremove
has to support wider kinds of pages other than anon, file-cache
swap-cache, mlocked() page used by direct I/O, HugeTLB pages and achieve
close to 100% guaranntee. Ignoring the fact migration and hotremove will
share the code, what they have to do is very different.
swap-based approach looks just intend to do process migration and
it itself looks not bad.
I think your point is that hotremove and migration will share some amounts of codes.
We are now discussing *direct* page migration and will share codes for anon pages.
It is being discussed in -lhms. We'd like to create good one.
