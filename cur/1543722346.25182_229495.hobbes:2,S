Yeah, though I'd start with "time foo" and if it's system time,
do a kernel profile. Let me know what it is, or give me a testcase ...
This is compared to 2.6.7 virgin? or -current? current code has some
wierd timer problems in mainline ... make sure to compare it to virgin.
Broken out patches are here under the patches/ subdir if you're desperate ;-)
