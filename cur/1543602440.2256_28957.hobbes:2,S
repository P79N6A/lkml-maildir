A common practice is to create a pseudo-arch directory, let's called
it 'shared' or 'common' and under it a directory for each component
that is shared. We can now have symbolic links for s shared file:
	arch/[mips|ppc]/pic.c -> arch/shared/pic-mippc.c
Or, for a shared subsystem 'pic1234'
	arch/[mips|ppc]/pic -> arch/shared/pic-mippc
One can even look at more similar archs and have
	arch/[mips|ppc]/pic -> arch/shared/mippc/pic
	arch/[mips|ppc]/mem -> arch/shared/mippc/mem
