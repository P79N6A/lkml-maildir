Yep, I've been tracking Casey's work on this since the first patch and sending 
comments when appropriate.  I'm going to take a look at the latest rev of the 
patch and if anything looks awry I'll be sure to let Casey know.
The only real wart that still remains from the original patch is the code in 
smk_cipso_doi() which has a nice comment at the top saying that Paul and 
Casey need to work out an appropriate interface between NetLabel and SMACK.  
We punted on it before because SMACK's future was still a bit uncertain and 
SELinux has no need for an interface like this at present.  Now that SMACK 
looks to be queued up for 2.6.24 it's time to revisit this discussion.
