The part about wbinvd flushing the TLB only appears in the PPro
manual. It isn't there in the Pentium manual, and isn't in the current
IA32 manual (perhaps it was removed in order to cover the Pentium, but
usually that manual notes P6-specific behaviour, so maybe the omission
is significant).

The errata for the Pentium Pro are in the "Specification Updates"
document. Hunt around on Intel's web site until you find the list of
PPro documents (manuals, etc.), and there should be a link to it
there.
I don't see anything relevant in it though.
