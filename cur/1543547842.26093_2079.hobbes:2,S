I run IKD 99.99% of the time (maintenance helper bee).  Still, I wouldn't
want to see it in the kernel.. except maybe kdb.  IKD is very intrusive
from the code readability standpoint.  Memleak in particular has a zillion
ugly ifdefs I don't know how to get rid of.

They can all be configured out, and they are all useful.  KDB is the only
one which (imho) could be integrated without uglifying the code.
