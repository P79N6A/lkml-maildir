I haven't tripped the bug so far today, although have been
running with page-sized fs blocksize so far - perhaps that
is implicated, and makes it less likely to trigger (when I
say "the bug" there, I mean neither the panic, nor the new
BUG_ON(); I'll revert back to smaller block sizes next).
That error path bio_put issue you spotted in XFS, Neil, I
think is a valid problem - I'm not sure that is reachable
code in practice (possibly overly defensive XFS bio code),
I'll go investigate that some more.
cheers.
