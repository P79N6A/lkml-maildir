I'm glad David Miller clarified this, because I was about to send a 
"don't do that" followup ;-)
But your example is misleading, or at least doesn't reflect customers I 
know. While a few clients with broken network connections may be 
unhappy, disabling scaling will make your web server really, really, 
slow, and that will make everyone unhappy. Particularly if the web 
content is flash or 2MB jpegs, or other ill-chosen stuff. You don't want 
people to think you are running at dial-up speeds.

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
