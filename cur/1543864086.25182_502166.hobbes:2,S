It would probably make sense to make CONFIG_RCU_PREEMPT dependent
on CONFIG_PREEMPT. I kept it independent because I wanted to
test rcupreempt as an equivalent RCU implementation not just
for its "preemptibility".

I am working to compare some latency numbers between different
implementations. I will have them out soon.

See the Table 2, page 10 of the paper mentioned above. There is a
~100ns cost per read-side critical section involved in the preemptible
version of RCU at the moment. Until, we are sure that we don't have
an impact on common workloads, we need to keep the "classic" 
implementation around.
