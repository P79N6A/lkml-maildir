For sound, there are more working solutions already made :
  - nas - network audio sound
  - rplay
both avaliable in the sunsite linux archive in the apps/sound/servers directory,
for example here : 
http://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/packages/Linux/sunsite.unc-mirror/apps/sound/servers/
There is also a package called AF ( audiofile ) avaliable somewhere on Digitals
sites ( ftp.digital.com , search the net ... )
And there is a similar project in the X windows project ...
Hope this helps
