Heh. According to your license, all you have to do is to get very expensive
disk. Then, put offender's file on that disk, and claim that your costs
exceeded 00000 (or how much you have in the licence) and that means auto
licence termination IIRC.
Oh and btw how can you change licence retroactively? Those "abusers" have
right to continue to use old versions under old licences...
