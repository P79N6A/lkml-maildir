Somebody has bogus profiling information. There's no way it's going to
take that long unless you have a broken filesystem that doesn't do the
hashes right and hashes everything to the same entry. Even if all of
memory is just dcache information, which is basically impossible to do.
If you get numbers like the above, then ALL your numbers are extremely
suspect, and I would seriously look into your methodology if I were you.
