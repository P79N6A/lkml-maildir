Mine is like this:
I: Bus=0011 Vendor=0001 Product=0001 Version=ab41
N: Name="AT Translated Set 2 keyboard"
P: Phys=isa0060/serio0/input0
S: Sysfs=/class/input/input0
H: Handlers=kbd event0
B: EV=120013
B: KEY=4 2000000 3802078 f840d001 f2ffffdf ffefffff ffffffff fffffffe
B: MSC=10
B: LED=7
I: Bus=0010 Vendor=001f Product=0001 Version=0100
N: Name="PC Speaker"
P: Phys=isa0061/input0
S: Sysfs=/class/input/input1
H: Handlers=kbd event1
B: EV=40001
B: SND=6
I: Bus=0011 Vendor=0002 Product=0005 Version=0000
N: Name="ImPS/2 Generic Wheel Mouse"
P: Phys=isa0060/serio1/input0
S: Sysfs=/class/input/input2
H: Handlers=event2 mouse0
B: EV=7
B: KEY=70000 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
B: REL=103
I don't know why my touchpad is not listed. I have one and it perfectly
works with X (same pointer as the mouse which is a Microsoft USB Wheel Mouse'
attached to PS/2 using an appropriate adapter.
