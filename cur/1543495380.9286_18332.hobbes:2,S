I run kernel 2.2.7 raw (ie, no patches, just as it comes), and I have
several cases where I'm using the loopback driver to mount various
files as file systems, not all of them CD images either. I've had no
problems with doing that at all...

Only way I know is to try to use it...

An empty CD image?
To check this out, try the following sequence of commands:
 Q> dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/dummy bs=1024 count=1024
 Q> mke2fs /tmp/dummy
Say yes when asked whether to proceed anyway...
 Q> mount -o loop /tmp/dummy /mnt
 Q> declare -i N=0
 Q> while [ $N -le 9 ]; do touch /mnt/$RANDOM ; N=$N+1 ; done
 Q> ls -al /mnt
This should show you a listing consisting of ten files of zero length
with numeric names, plus the directories . and .. and a line saying
"total 0" ???
Best wishes from Riley.
