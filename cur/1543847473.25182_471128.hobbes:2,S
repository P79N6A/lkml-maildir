There are a number of reasons:
 (1) There are a bunch of independent log2 implementations lying around in the
     code.  It'd be nice to just have one set that anyone can use.
 (2) Not everyone realises that fls() can be used to do log2().
 (3) ilog2(n) != fls(n)
     This means that the asm-optimised version for one might be less optimal
     for the other (for example, ilog2() produces an undefined result if n <=
     1, fls() must return 0).
 (4) There are occasions when you might want to take a log2 of a constant.
     With the totally inline asm approach, it would always execute some code,
     though it should be unnecessary.  What I've done permits you to avoid that
     as the answer is always going to be the same.
 (5) fls() and fls64() can't be used to initialise a variable at compile time,
     ilog2() can.
