Once again, do in kernel space what *makes sense* to do in kernel
space.  In this case, static serving with a policy from user space
makes pretty good sense to do in kernel space (like knfsd vs unfsd)
whereas it would be idiotic to do dynamic serving or set policy there.
Besides, it's (a) optional and (b) localized (doesn't mess around with
any other kernel code).  You wouldn't want it in a machine that wasn't
a web server as its main function, that's for sure.
