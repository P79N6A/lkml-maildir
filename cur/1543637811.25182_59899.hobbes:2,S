Yep, I'll do that with the next release.

Sure,... anything to get these interfaces merged :)
Are you looking at something on the lines as the diff below? 
What about /proc/stat ? Is it a good idea to have separate /proc files
for disk stats and cpu usage stats? (It'll be good for statctrs that way,
applications monitoring disk_stats only don't cause statctr_reads on
cpu_usage stats then)
