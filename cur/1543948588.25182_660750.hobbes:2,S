Hmm, shouldn't patches be sent inline ?
Otherwise I need to cut&paste in order to reply.
Anyway. cpu_system_map looks fine. It's identical in functionality (minus the 
notifier) to the ~cpu_isolated_map. Different name works for me.
As I explained in the prev reply I suggest we use CPU hotplug instead of the 
brand new notifier mechanism that requires changes to a bunch of things, and 
at the end of the day ends up doing the same exact thing. ie Moving things out 
of the CPU that is being isolated.

I beleive those masks belong in kernel/cpu.c instead of kernel/sched.c.
It can be done with a separate patch of course.
