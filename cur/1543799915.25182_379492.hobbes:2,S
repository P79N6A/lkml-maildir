So what is the format of the *_id attributes?  Looks like this is
determined by the architecture, which is okay, but it doesn't seem
explicit.
What about sane default values for the *_id attributes?  For example,
say I have a uniprocessor PC without HT or multicore -- should all of
these attributes have zero values, or some kind of "special" value to
mean "not applicable"?
Hmm, why should thread_id be exported at all?  Is it useful to
userspace in a way that the logical cpu id is not?

Okay, but which combinations of attributes are valid?  E.g. I would
think that it's fine for an architecture to define topology_thread_id
and topology_thread_siblings without any of the others, correct?
Also I'd rather the architectures have the ability to define these as
functions instead of macros.

Can't sysfs_create_group fail?

I don't think it makes much sense to add and remove the attribute
group for cpu online/offline events.  The topology information for an
offline cpu is potentially valuable -- it could help the admin decide
which processor to online at runtime, for example.
I believe the correct time to update the topology information is when
the topology actually changes (e.g. physical addition or removal of a
processor) -- this is independent of online/offline operations.
In general, I'm still a little uneasy with exporting the cpu topology
in this way.  I can see how the information would be useful, and right
now, Linux does not do a great job of exposing to userspace these
relationships between cpus.  So I see the need.  But the things about
this approach which I don't like are:
- Attributes which are not applicable to the running system will be
  exported anyway.  Discovery at runtime would be less confusing, I
  think.
- This locks us into exporting a three-level topology (thread, core,
  package), with hard-coded names, when it seems probable that there
  will be systems with more levels than that in the future.
Have you considered basing the exported topology on sched domains?
