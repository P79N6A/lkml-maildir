Assume the user has a /dev/white_dvd and a /dev/black_dvd, both of being 
the same brand. `cdrecord -scanbus` would return sth like
scsibus0:
        0,0,0     0) *
        0,1,0     1) 'HL-DT-ST' 'DVDRAM GSA-4160B' 'A301' Removable CD-ROM
        0,2,0     2) *
        0,3,0     3) *
        0,4,0     4) *
        0,5,0     5) *
        0,6,0     6) *
        0,7,0     7) *
scsibus1:
        1,0,0     0) *
        1,1,0     1) 'HL-DT-ST' 'DVDRAM GSA-4160B' 'A301' Removable CD-ROM
        1,2,0     2) *
        1,3,0     3) *
        1,4,0     4) *
        1,5,0     5) *
        1,6,0     6) *
        1,7,0     7) *
probably. But how to find out from the btl which one is the black and which 
one is the white one?
