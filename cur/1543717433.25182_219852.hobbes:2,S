Adding arch-specific stuff to an include/asm-generic/ header file is
not nice.
However, having to create an arch-specific version of the header
just becasue you need this wrapper is also not nice.
And "SYMBOL" is a too generic identifier: it may clash with other things.
Could I suggest that you change asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.h to do:
#ifndef VMLINUX_SYMBOL
#define VMLINUX_SYMBOL(_sym_) _sym_
#endif
	...
-		__start___ksymtab = .;					\
+		VMLINUX_SYMBOL(__start___ksymtab) = .;			\
Then, in some h8300-specific file, do:
	#define VMLINUX_SYMBOL(_sym_) _##_sym_
	#include <asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.h>
and include that file instead of asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.h?
(I am unable to find where h8300 actually includes vmlinux.lds.h. 
Confused).
