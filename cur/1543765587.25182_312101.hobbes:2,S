A nice thing in FAQ would be some info on problematic (blacklisted) SATA 
hardware that runs on Linux (vide "poor SATA performance under 2.6.11 
(with < 2.6.11 is OK)?" thread), like Silicon Image 311x controllers + 
some Seagate drives [1].

[1] although my drive is blacklisted (Seagate barracuda - ST3200822AS), 
I "unblacklisted" it to get full performance - it's under heavy stress 
for 12th hour, and still no error.
