Subject: NFS instability, related to heavy load,downed servers,and SMP (?)

We are a lab with a computing cluster of 24 Linux RedHat 5.2 hosts with 2
SMP CPU's each which run kernel 2.2.12 patched with NFSv3 version 0.14.6.
The cluster is used for VERY large, intensive jobs reading and writing
data to/from NFS drives served by Suns.
When one of the Sun servers go down for a couple hours, we get many
messages logged (as expected) in the form of:
Nov  4 13:10:06 a03 kernel: nfs: server dc04 not responding, timed out 
and when the server comes back up, a:
Nov  4 13:10:06 a03 kernel: nfs: server dc04 OK  
Load usually rises to an absurd level (as high as 30!) until the server
returns.
However, the NFS system (and the kernel in general) seems to become 
unstable during and after this period, and we get frequent log messages in
the form:
Nov  4 22:09:48 a03 kernel: nfs: task 51371 can't get a request slot 
even hours after the NFS server is back online.  Some of our hosts die
(they return pings, but won't allow even console logins or any network
services.  a hard reset is necessary) either during the server down time,
and even hours after the down time.
Looking through the linux-kernel archives, I found several of you who have
reported the same problem, all seeming to run SMP with 2.2 series
kernels, some with and some without the NFSv3 patches.
No solutons were posted, however.  I've attached a consolidated copy of
the problem reports in the hopes that it would be useful.
Please let me know of any solutions or fixes, and post it to linux-kernel
so other can find it.  
Thanks,

NFS 2.2beta40 (fwd)

I sent this to Olaf last week, but after reading some other posts I get
the feeling that he is too busy for NFS.
---------- Forwarded message ----------
Hi,
I'm guessing you get asked this alot, but I can't find any offical
notice regarding it. The 2.2 kernel changelog says you should use
2.2beta40 of NFS, but that is located in a dir called dontuse. It's my
understanding that you maintain it? Someone asked on the linux-kernel list
and the question went unanswered. If you want I'll ask there again and see
if I get a response from someone else.
Basically we are having a problem with NFS on several of our machines that
are running 2.2.1-ac5 kernels and a mix of SMP and UP.
The simple warning is:
Feb 12 18:22:41 thelia kernel: nfs warning: mount version older than
kernel
The problem is when nfs takes the cpu load up to 12.0 or higher.
The message that is displayed is:
Feb 12 17:56:50 hurricane kernel: nfs: task 51686 can't get a request slot
Feb 12 17:56:51 hurricane kernel: nfs: task 51688 can't get a request slot
Feb 12 17:56:52 hurricane kernel: nfs: task 51685 can't get a request slot
Feb 12 17:56:53 hurricane kernel: nfs: task 51687 can't get a request slot
Feb 12 17:56:54 hurricane kernel: nfs: task 51691 can't get a request slot
Feb 12 17:56:58 hurricane kernel: nfs: task 51690 can't get a request slot
Feb 12 17:57:02 hurricane kernel: nfs: task 51686 can't get a request slot
Feb 12 17:57:03 hurricane kernel: nfs: task 51688 can't get a request slot
Feb 12 17:57:04 hurricane kernel: nfs: task 51685 can't get a request slot
Feb 12 17:57:05 hurricane kernel: nfs: task 51687 can't get a request slot
These repeat constantly and NFS is basically unusable.
Could you give me some suggestions on things to try and possibly answer
the question everyone wants to know which is about the dontuse?
thanks

NFS performance drops after days of uptime
Burkhard Bunk (bunk@physik.hu-berlin.de)

Hi,
I have a problem with the long term performance of NFS.
After some days (or weeks) of uptime, the following messages set in on
the NFS CLIENT ("ficus5"):
Jun  4 13:09:25 ficus5 kernel: nfs: server linde not responding, still trying
Jun  4 13:09:35 ficus5 kernel: nfs: server linde OK

Jun  4 13:30:52 ficus5 last message repeated 3 times
...
At the same time, all operations with nfs file systems slow down and make
the client unusable. Unmounting or restarting nfs doesn't help.
Note that server "ficus7" is another linux system, but "linde" is a HP
(running HP-UX 10.20). At the same time, other clients can access these
servers as always. The sick client can only be cured by a REBOOT (AFAIK).
The symptoms may reappear after days or weeks of normal uptime.
Hardware:   Dual PPro200 on S1662D 440FX PCI-ISA board
            Adaptec AHA-2940A Ultra SCSI host adapter
            SMC-Ultra ethernet card
The problem was already present when running
      RedHat 4.2 / kernel 2.0.3x-SMP
and unfortunately persists under
      Debian 2.1 / kernel 2.2.{4,9}-SMP
Since all our linux boxes are running SMP kernels, I don't know whether
the problem is related to SMP.
How to get further diagnostics?
Need fancy mount options?
Any ideas?

Can someone explain what this message means?

Feb 4 08:51:49 sk kernel: nfs: task 31660 can't get a request slot
After seeing these messages, nfs on this SMP 2.2.1 machine no longer
works. The problem only seems to crop up if the machine accesses its own
nfs server (ie: export a directory and then access the directory via amd's
automounter on the same machine).

I'm having the same problem with pristine 2.2.4. Also with amd (latest
am-utils package from redhat, other places may have newer ones).
I tried to add anouther amd mount point but got the configuration file
wrong at the first try. So amd had 1 working and 1 nonworking mount
point (mount point type parameter was wrong in my conf. file). And when
I tell amd to stop (via /etc/rc.d/init.d/amd stop), the process just
hangs. It's sitting there right now: 2 processes in rpc_execute, one amd
and one shell script to unload amd. And syslog says
nfs: task 13820 can't get a request slot
So probably amd messed something up and the nfs client can't talk to
amd. The message seems to be a only consequence of the amd problem and
the real problem is probably the hanging amd.

The problem only occurs on our quad SMP when all processors are running
disk-intensive simulations. I will try to bypass amd and see what
happens... The problem is sporadic and therefore hard to repeat.

Horrible NFS performace

I hope that someone can shed some light here, or give me a way to
investigate. 3 computers, 2 are 2.2.6, 1 is 2.0.36. All ethernet. 2.2.6 has
PCI vortex, 2.0.36 has Intel ether express 16. Lots of the following in
logs:

inx is the 2.0.36 kernel. This came from copying a file from either mwg or
support to inx. I get a lot of server not responding from mwg and support,
too. Everything is user NFS daemons, because I can't get the kernel daemons
to export all the mount points: kexportfs gets an invalid argument on mount
directories from the kernel. The backup last night (tape drive is on inx)
did not finish because of these problems.

It's a problem that can occur both under NFSv3 and stock 2.2.10 (since
it just means that the RPC layer is blocked for some reason).
I have recently been trying to hack up the RPC layer under the NFSv3
patches. The main interest is getting the RPC over TCP to work
reliably, and to reduce the problems with the socket layers running
out of buffer memory (the latter is a problem when you have 32k
wsizes). This means that the last few batches of NFSv3 patches have
been a bit unstable (sorry) but should hopefully improve.
It would therefore be very helpful to me if you could give me some
more details about which version of the patches you're using. Note
that version 0.9.9.2 did have a bug which could give symptoms like the
ones you're seeing. I put out 0.9.10 last evening in order to fix it.
Cheers,
Trond
