Your refcounting is totally broken.  fds can be passed around in the same
process group (which btw is not something driver should look at because
there are variants of different kinds of process groups depending on clone
flags), and your driver is going boom in most of the case.
We don't export the routines to acquire reference to task structs for
a reason, and this piece of junk called xpmem is not going to change it.
