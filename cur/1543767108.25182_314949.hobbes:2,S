But just because fencing is supposed to happen in an external component, 
we can't wave our hands at it and skip the analysis.  We _must_ identify the 
fencing assumptions and trace the fencing paths with respect to every 
recovery algorithm in every cluster component, including the dlm.
I suspect that when we do get around to properly scrutinizing fencing 
requirements of specific recovery algorithms, we will find that the fencing 
system currently on offer for gfs needs a little work.
