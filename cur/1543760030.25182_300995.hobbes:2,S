no. If something is not working in 2.6.11 i will switch to 
2.6.10 ;-) and _maybe_ report  a bug

Let me tell you what i understood from this thread:
2.6.12 "almost stable"
2.6.13 devel (new drivers,fixes  and stuff -- may be broken)
2.6.14 (based on 2.6.13) tries to became stable again
2.6.15 also devel (see above)
2.6.16 (based on 2.6.15) also tries to became stable again
So we will _want_ to have a stable kernel (like 2.4 now) but 
this will never happen (see above)

You said it. Hopefully you will make our life easier and we 
(as testers) will make your's.
