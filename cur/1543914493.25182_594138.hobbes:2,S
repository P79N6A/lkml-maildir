It's actually not small, since it turns the skb allocation into a
4100-byte buffer, which ends up being more than 1 page usually, which
means it fails if memory is fragmented.
Anyway given the backlog anything substantial that hasn't been posted
already is almost surely going to have to wait until 2.6.25.
