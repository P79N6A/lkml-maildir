Bullshit.  There's no more guessing involved than you thinking 8K stacks
are sufficient.   How do you know that 8K stacks are enough?   If you
don't understand the testing and common sense that has gone into 4K+4K
stacks you should really be putting in a patch for 128K stacks, because
you don't have any proof that 8K stacks are sufficient either (except by
voodoo and wild guessing).   However, if you _do_ understand the testing
and coding methods then you'll see that 4K + 4K stacks are sufficient
(modulo any bugs, which should be fixed).
