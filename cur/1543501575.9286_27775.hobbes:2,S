Hello,
I did some more tests (2.2.10):
1) I added some debug code to ipconfig.c.   It seems that the following
lines in ic_bootp_recv is to blame:
(631)	ip_fast_csum((char *)h, h->ihl) != 0 ||
(636)	ntohs(h->tot_len) < ntohs(b->udph.len) + sizeof(struct iphdr))
The value returned from (631) is always 3 (in my setup).   The
comparison in (636) is always  72 < 328.
2) If I comment these two lines ip_bootp_recv succeeds ... almost.   The
returned ip-addr is 33554698 (which translates to  10.1.0.2).  It should
be 33620234 (= 10.1.1.2).
3) Using a real bootp-server (instead of the ISC combi dhcp+bootp)
doesn't help.
4) Running dhclient in userland succeeds - so I guess it's not the
serverside which is to blame ...
I hope somebody out there can help me in getting this to work ...
Kind regards,
Brian
