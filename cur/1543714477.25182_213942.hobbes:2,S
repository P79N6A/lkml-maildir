Good that your hi-load is fixed just by routing the timer through io-apic.
Could you try the "nmi_watchdog=1" kernel arg please.
You should get a message in your boot log as to whether it works
also cat /proc/interrupts to see if it stops. 
Wouldn't hurt to try "nmi_watchdog=2" either.
I had a situation where "nmi_watchdog=2" tested ok in boot log
but halted after 23 interrupts.
