I think you're focussing on the 64k number WAY too much. Yes it's too
small. But it's an initial number to show the infrastructure and get it
tested. Yes it should and will be increased later on in the patch
series.
Same for the other heap randomisation.
This thing is about getting the infrastructure in place and used. The
actual numbers are mere finetuning that can be done near the end.
