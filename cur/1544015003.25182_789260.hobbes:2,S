Hi,
There is a hibernation regression (from 2.6.28 and in fact from some later
2.6.28-git too) on my Toshiba Portege R500 that swsusp sometimes cannot find
its resume device.  Specifically, open_by_devnum() in swsusp_check()
(kernel/power/swap.c) fails.  This seems to happen at random, approximately
50% of the time.
I wonder if that might be caused by the Arjan's asynchrounous boot patches.
Thanks,
Rafael
