Yes this is a good idea of course ;). I only wanted a figure of the
numbers and so I didn't bothered to do all the stuff necessary for a very
precise bench.

There is a better way than the sleep one: in 2.2.x on i386 you can iopl(2)
and asm("cli" :: ) by hand to do a precise bench. On 2.3.x you'll have to
boot with the nonmi option to achieve the same.
