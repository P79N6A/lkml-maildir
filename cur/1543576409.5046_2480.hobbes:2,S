Hi Andre,
I wonder if you know anything about a issues with AMD-Irongate IDE
controller and a Maxtor IDE disk?
Here's what happens: The thing runs fine in (hdparm -d1 -m8 -c1) mode,
giving good performance and no problems for some time (something like
some days, a week, a month).
Then, suddenly, during disk activity, the hard disk access stops.
Linux is running fine, but as there is no more HD access possible,
more and more processes start hanging.
The strange thing: When rebooting using the reset button, the BIOS
can not find the hard disk. You may press reset as often as you want
to no avail.
After a power cycle, everything is back to normal, again.
This happened a couple of times now, already.
I did not catch any syslog messages, unfortunately, but I'll configure
syslog to log over the network, so the next time, I may have something.
I suspect the drive's firmware or the AMD IDE chipset driver.
Any ideas?
