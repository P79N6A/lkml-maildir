   IA64 could just use the generic mechanism, like everyone else.  But
   they do the tricky 64k mapping thing.  As I pointed out, maybe their
   decision would have to be rethought if that proves inadaquate.
But we should also give them the option to implement module percpu
data using indirect buffers.
