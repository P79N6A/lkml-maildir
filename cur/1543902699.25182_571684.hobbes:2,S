Subject: kmalloc zero size changes break i386

qemu testing and booting test machines with i386 kernels wasn't very successfull
with recent git kernels. I got either BUGs because of failing sysfs initialization
or oopses in kmalloc, but no user land.
I bisected it down to this commit.
To reproduce: try to boot a 386 defconfig kernel, compiled with gcc 4.1, in qemu

    Slab allocators: consistent ZERO_SIZE_PTR support and NULL result semantics
    Define ZERO_OR_NULL_PTR macro to be able to remove the checks from the
    allocators.  Move ZERO_SIZE_PTR related stuff into slab.h.
    Make ZERO_SIZE_PTR work for all slab allocators and get rid of the
    WARN_ON_ONCE(size == 0) that is still remaining in SLAB.
    Make slub return NULL like the other allocators if a too large memory segmen
t
    is requested via __kmalloc.
