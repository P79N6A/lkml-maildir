Indeed, please do. Especially as I cannot reproduce the problem here.
I did a "make allnoconfig" and then selected EXPERIMENTAL and 
CONFIG_SPARSEMEM through "make menuconfig".
This gives many "pfn to_to_nid" redefined warnings, but no error.
BTW., the warnings appear even if dont-include-schedh-from-moduleh.patch 
is backed out. Thus I plead "not guilty". ;-)
