Subject: [PATCH] dz: Update Kconfig description
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/19/314

 Reformat the Kconfig entries and update descriptions for accuracy.  
Select the driver by default for configurations of interest.  For the 
curious: 32BIT means only 32-bit DECstations support the device, not that 
the driver is not 64-bit clean; I have not checked that either though.
