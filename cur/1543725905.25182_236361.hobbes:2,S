So the events are some kind of structured printk()s, right? So why not
printk() as a side-effect of sending an event. Then we could change
relevant printk()s (but not the debug ones for example) and thereby
remove the existing printk() and (re)structure them in the process.
And if this (together with a file-changed notifier) could help me stop
polling 28 files once a second for events (/var/log recursively,
/proc/modules, /proc/mounts, /proc/net/arp and 'netstat -ltup' output)
I would be really happy...
