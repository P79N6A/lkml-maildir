I guess I'm not going to convince you, but again I think that "its
functionality is in the filesystem" is misleading.  A small fraction
of its functionality is in the filesystem.  Checkin, etc is not in
the filesystem.  You can use all Clearcase functions without the
filesystem.
You seem to be talking about putting all RCS functions in the
filesystem, using a minimum of new operation (open flags, ioctls),
and I'm saying you can't legitimately point to Clearcase and claim
"it's been done".
