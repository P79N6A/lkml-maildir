Subject: [PATCH] FEC_8xx dependency on CONFIG_PPC
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Just noticed that make allmodconfig breaks on i386 due to the FEC_8xx 
driver.
I don't know much about FEC_8xx but I have a feeling that's because it is 
intended only for PPC boxes.
A simple change to drivers/net/fec_8xx/Kconfig to make it dependent on PPC 
in addition to NET_ETHERNET allows make allmodconfig to build.
Please suggest if the attached patch is Ok.
