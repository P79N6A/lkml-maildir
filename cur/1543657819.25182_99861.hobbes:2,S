 I've seen similar problems... and most of the times this seems due to 
 incorrect tuned mitigation. Think of what happens if you don't have TX-
 interrupts enough to clean your TX-ring. Which means your app. can not
 fill it at full speed -- and as long you have RX traffic it contributes 
 with interrupts so the problem is not visile. 
 If you test IP-forwarding with RX soly on one interface and TX soly on the
 other and routing between them. You'll see drops at the qdisc in such case.
 Cheers.
