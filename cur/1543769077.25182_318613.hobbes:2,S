And the original i286 couldn't address more than 64k, either. But of 
course it could and did, using the large model which used segment 
registers to address additional memory. In terms of hardware this 
certainly could be done using 4GB segments on newer processors. In terms 
of available compiler and O/S support, you're stuck with using tricks, 
as various people have noted.
In terms of generating correct code, with all the bad things people have 
said about the cost of doing segmentation, it was vastly more likely to 
be correct code if you could just pretend that you have linear address 
space and let the compiler/lib/os play let's pretend for you.
If you really need to address more than 4GB perhaps a 64 bit hardware is 
the better solution.
