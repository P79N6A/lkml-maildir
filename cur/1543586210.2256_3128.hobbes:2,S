Hi,
I just made a manipulation that disturbs me. So I'm asking whether it's a
bug or a features.
user> su
root> echo "test" > test
root> ls -l
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root            5 Mar 29 19:14 test
root> exit
user> rm test
rm: remove write-protected file `test'? y
user> ls test
ls: test: No such file or directory
This is in the user home directory.
Since the file is read only for the user, it should not be able to remove
it. Moreover, the user can't write to test.
So I think this is a bug.
