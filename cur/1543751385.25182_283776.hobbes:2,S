I second that, after resume my machine does exactly the same.
It swaps in most of the data, but it leaves ~1700kB on the swapdevice
that it doesn't manage to swap in, and apparently reads this over and
over again.
But it probably doesn't have anything to do with swsusp, I can reproduce
it without ever having suspended, just fill up the memory so the machine
swaps and then the same thing happens.
Apparently kernels from -bk in late december works fine, so it's a
recent introduction.
Needs investigating.
