Ok.  Didn't know that it was maintained.  I knew that you would
set the record straight either way though.  ;o)

I can't comment there much..  I've used PINE since about 1993 and
fell in love with it after using PMDF in VMS (which sucks by
comparison).  PINE by default is simple to use for beginners, but
if you go into setup and enable all the advanced stuff it is
incredibly powerful.  I tried mutt once but couldn't handle the
non-intuitive UI.  (intuitivity being in the eye of the beholder
of course)  ;o)
I know many people who swear by mutt though, but I prefer the
nicer UI of PINE.  The only thing I hate about PINE is the
restricted source code license that makes it impossible to
contribute bugfixes effectively.  ;o(
TIA
