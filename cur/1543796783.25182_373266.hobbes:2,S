it would still be dependent on system-load situations. It's an 
interesting idea to use a timer for that, but there is no strict 
synchronization between "get time of day" and "timer execution", so any 
timer-based leap-second handling would be fundamentally asynchronous. I 
dont think we want that, leap second handling should be a synchronous 
property of 'time'.
i think the very first step should be the cleanups i did to the NTP 
portions of timer.c. That made all the code (including leap second 
handling) more readable. I think a portion of the inner desire to 
rewrite the NTP code comes from the current spaghetti that accumulated 
over the years.
