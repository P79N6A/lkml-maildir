On the other hand, having to multiplex in userspace requires calls to 
poll() et al, _and_ explicitly handling state which the kernel needs 
to handle anyway -- including locking and all that crap.
Given that an efficient and fairly-low-cost 1:1 implementation is 
demonstrably possible ;-) the necessity to do any kind of n:m work 
strikes me as extremely low.
