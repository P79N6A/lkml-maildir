unfortunately java was originally designed with a thread-per-connection
model as the *only* method of implementing servers.  there wasn't a
non-blocking network API ... and i hear that such an API is in the works,
but i've no idea where it is yet.
so while this is I/O, it's certainly less efficient to have thousands of
tasks blocked in read(2) versus having thousands of entries in <pick your
favourite poll/select/etc. mechanism>.
this is a java problem though... i posted a jvm straw-man proposal years
ago when IBM posted some "linux threading isn't efficient" paper.  since
java threads are way less painful to implement than pthreads, i suggested
the jvm do the M part of M:N.
