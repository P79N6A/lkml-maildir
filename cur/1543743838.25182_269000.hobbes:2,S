A good thing would be to make the OOM killer only kill
processes that actually overcommit (independant of overcommit mode).
The first step would be adding a value in /proc/$pid/...
somewhere that shows how much a process is overcommitted when
overcommit is enabled. This would allow important processes to be
fixed for all overcommit modes.
