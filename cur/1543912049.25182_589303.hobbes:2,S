I have been doing enough CPU offline/online test these days and it works fine.
But there is no cpufreq driver which supports my machine. So my test didn't
cover test cpu hotplug code in cpufreq.
If you have cpufreq driver and it is built as module, it is worth trying
same test after unloading cpufreq driver in order to narrow down the problem
area.
