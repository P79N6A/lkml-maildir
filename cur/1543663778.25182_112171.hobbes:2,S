I have made those patches to workaround that.  I have no time
to rediff it though (sorry), but it is easy to get it.  I also CC
to Robert Woerle because he has already send a PR to the
bios mainteners.

Don't know what happens: I have no paceblade and it sound like it
is OK for Robert ?
this one is bad.  Only here in order to get the second diff apply cleanly.

This one is the good one.  Need to be rediffed correctly, or to be changed for 2.5.

It is much better to kill the lines in #if 0 ... #endif of course.
