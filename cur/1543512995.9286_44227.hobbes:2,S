I have the same message when I _start_ X. As soon as the XDM loginscreen 
is there, or when X is running, the mouse and keyboard don't work. They
do during boot. Don't know if the message is related with the malfunctioning
of the keyboard and mouse.
This is with kernel 2.3.21 pre-patch-2.3.22-2
Kernel 2.3.19 is fine (didn't test another)
Mouse and keyboard are PS/2
No gpm (disabled)
Debian Potato:
 XFree86 Version 3.3.5 / X Window System
 (protocol Version 11, revision 0, vendor release 6300)
 Release Date: August 23 1999
If I kill X via a remote login, keyboard works again (at console thus)
I would be happy to supply more info if nescessary.
