Just to humor me, can you try it with gcc 2.95.4?  I just want to
eliminate one variable....

what directory was 4243459?  You can use the debugfs's ncheck command
to get back a pathname from an inode number?
Are you sure the filesystem was consistent before you started this
whole procedure?  
It sounds like you hadn't started modifying directories at this point
in the procedure.  Yet this error ("directory #XXXX contains a hole")
is printed by the non-indexed-directory version of readdir.  So that
would imply that the directory with the initial error reported on it
was not an indexed directory.....  very strange!

What were the directory inode numbers, and what pathname did they map
to?

This message will appear if previously some other part of ext2
reported a filesystem inconsistency.  So it's a symptom, and not the
root cause of the problem.

Against, what was the pathnmae to the inode #131073?
This is strange, since I'm not seeing any of the problems that you're
seeing.  I'm going to need a lot more information if I'm going to have
a prayer of a chance of digging into it.
