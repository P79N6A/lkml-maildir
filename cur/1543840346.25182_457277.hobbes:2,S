If you _ever_ catch me getting confused because I'm trying to build an
ISDN driver and I can't work out that in order to do this, I might need
to first enable CONFIG_ISDN, then I promise you I will change my name by
deed poll to 'Aunt Tillie'.
It isn't hard to find dependencies by looking in the Kconfig files, even
if they are slightly less blindingly obvious than that example. I think
'make xconfig' will even show you the dependencies these days. I
remember even in about 1996 the Nemesis folks had hacked the old tcl
xconfig script to show dependencies.
Finding the brain-damaged 'select' which is preventing me from turning a
given option _off_, however, is something I tend to find far more
difficult. The CONFIG_EMBEDDED crap took up a painful amount of my time
last week when it bit me too.
