   	Part of the sock cleanup made me remove the #include <linux/tcp.h> from
   include/linux/ip.h and from include/net/sock.h, i.e., it is not needed in
   those headers, but then I had to go to udp.c, ipx.c, decnet, etc, and add a
   #include <linux/tcp.h> because it needs TCP_ESTABLISHED, TCP_CLOSE, etc,
   this is a pet peeve to me, as a janitor :-) Can I change this to
   PROTO_ESTABLISHED, PROTO_CLOSE, etc, and have it on a different header, say
   include/net/protocol.h?  Its strange to have IPX, DecNET, etc having to
   include net/tcp.h (that in turn includes ip.h, etc).
   	If this is ok I can bundle it in the sock cleanup or send it
   separately, your call.
These other protocols are just borrowing state machine states from
TCP.  I really see no reason to rename them, because then if you did
the TCP usage wouldn't make look right anymore. :-)
I don't mind moving the header include from sock.h to the protocols
though.
Franks a lot,
