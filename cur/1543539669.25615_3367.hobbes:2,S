No. It's just REALLY bad line :-/

Motorolla 3265 is expensive but what's MORE important is that it was not
able to connect on said line with V.34 at all: only 1200 works with beast :-/
Courier works just fine if you'll select right speed (Ok, it's not normal
Courier as well: standard US firmware worked bad as well so few tweaks was
needed - BTW as you can see firmware upgrades can be used not only by
crackers to destroy you hardware :-). Motorolla works GREAT on good lines
and even average lines but when when line has such a bad quility that you
consider yourself lucky if you can send few letters via UUCP (since
you can do this at all when moon is in right phase :-) then no, Motorolla
is not even an option.
