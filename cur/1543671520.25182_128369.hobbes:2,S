Hi,
as of late I'm getting a lot of messages with a couple of days(!) delay 
delivered. Others from the same thread come in with no noticable delay.
For example

Message-Id: <200304231946.UAA06070@gw.chygwyn.com>
Subject: Re: 2.5.68: net/decnet/dn_route.c doesn't compile
got stuck five days in some queue

Replies to this came in long before. Anyone else having these sort of problems 
lately or should I go flame my email provider? :)
Bye
