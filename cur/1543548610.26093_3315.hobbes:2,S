Finally some clarity with what is going on inside this Dell CPx650
laptop (TI PCI1225 Cardbus bridge).  Yes, it _is_ contact bounce.  It
seems to find the 3com NIC particularly offensive - the card can easily
bounce out 150 milliseconds after the first insertion interrupt.
The user-visible effect of contact bounce is the message "cs: socket
xxxxxxxx timed out during reset".  What happens is that the insertion
causes an interrupt, we wait for setup_delay to expire, then we apply
power.  The card becomes ready about 10 milliseconds later (according
to CB_PWRCYCLE).  Then the card bounces in and out of the socket.  The
card is auto-powered down and doesn't come back up.  Hence the timeout.
On to the patch:
- During the conversion from timer-based to thread-based control,
  several of the magical delays in cs.c (setup_delay, resume_delay,
  shutdown_delay) got themselves accidentally reduced by a factor of
  ten.  
  These have been set back to what they are in David's latest
  release.  Everything is now in terms of centiseconds (1 cs = 1/100th
  of a second).  Not a particularly user-friendly unit, but it
  preserves module parm compatibility with pcmcia-cs.
  There is one subtle change here: in pcmcia-cs the module parameter:
        options cs.o setup_delay=100
  means to delay 100 jiffies.  With this patch, it means 100
  centiseconds.  These are equivalent if HZ=100, but the delays in
  pcmcia_cs will vary inversely with variations in HZ.
- Capriciously doubled the value of setup_delay to 10 centiseconds.
- Changed the "socket timed out" message to tell people to try
  increasing the value of setup_delay.
- Debouncing.
  This is a bug in the current implementation.  When a card is
  inserted, we take an interrupt and the thread is scheduled.  If,
  during the thread execution, the card bounces out and in (very
  likely), an additional interrupt is generated and
  socket->events:SS_DETECT is set.  When parse_events returns, the
  thread sees the buffered insertion event and calls parse_events
  again.  parse_events has no choice but to power down the card, kick
  out the driver, reload the driver, beep, beep, beep.
  There are a number of ways of addressing this, and a lot of them
  won't work.  This patch treats `setup_delay' as the debounce period. 
  When this delay expires it sends a message to the low-level driver
  telling it that the debounce period has ended, and that it should now
  forget any buffered insertion events which it had saved up.  This was
  implemented via the new "one shot" flag socket_state_t.flags:SS_DEBOUNCED.
  Now, clearing events:SS_DETECT after the expiry of setup_delay begs
  the question "what if the card has really been ejected"? That's OK,
  because setup_socket checks this - if the card isn't there then it
  takes the "no card" path and everything is happy (I tested this).
  Finally, if we _do_ get contact bounce even after the expiry of
  setup_delay, we get a reset timeout and the card services state
  machine gives up.  But there is now a buffered-up insertion event! So
  parse_events is again called and everything works out.
BTW: It appears that these Cardbus controllers have protection
circuitry which turns off the voltages when the card is unplugged. 
With this controller, the voltage remains off even when the card
bounces back in again (fair enough).  So the controller is in a state
where the CB_SOCKET_CONTROL register has the value 0x33, but there is
no voltage at the card.  So this test in yenta_set_power():
        if (reg != cb_readl(socket, CB_SOCKET_CONTROL))
                cb_writel(socket, CB_SOCKET_CONTROL, reg);
prevents us from powering the card back up.  If the test is removed,
then the act of writing 0x33 to a register which already has a value of
0x33 _does_ power the card up.  But this is just FYI.  I left the test
in.
