I am also running a BP6 with 2 400MHz Celerons at the standard
66MHz. It is one of the earliest boards (metal levers, mislabelled
fan headers), and I haven't updated the BIOS.
I have no hard numbers, but it seemed that the further along in the
2.3 series kernels that I ran, the faster it locked up. 2.2.13 seems
a lot more stable. I'm only running IDE drives, but ECC 8ns memory. 
Lockups are total -- no message on serial console, no way to switch
from X to graphics console, no alt-sysrq keys, no ping, no keyboard
response, nothing.
C> Perhaps someone should start a linux-bp6 mailing list? 
Sure. And my first question is: how does someone with absolutely no
Dos/Windows expertise (and without a copy of the software) upgrade
the BIOS? The BIOS upgrade instructions all assume DOS/Windows...
