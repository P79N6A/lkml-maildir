Looks very bad. Not the '>25 load', don't panic if that reaches more than 50 or more, 
if at the same time the processors don't reaches the 100%. 
First reconfigure your apache, with
MaxClients 256  # absolute minimum, maybe you have to recompile apache
MinSpareServers 100  # better 150 to 200
MaxSpareServers 200 # bring it near MaxClients
Make shure, you have enough resources available, su to apache, make shure
 ulimit -a
data seg size (kbytes)      unlimited
file size (blocks)          unlimited
max locked memory (kbytes)  unlimited
max memory size (kbytes)    unlimited
open files                  65536 (!!)
pipe size (512 bytes)       8
stack size (kbytes)         unlimited
cpu time (seconds)          unlimited
max user processes          4095 (!!)
virtual memory (kbytes)     unlimited
cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max
131072
Your machine should handle that. 
Reason: Bring the count of forks of apache clients to a minimum. But you have to be careful.
You need everywhere the needed resources, max client connects to mysql for example. 
And increase the apache-servers in several steps. If you have a bug or bad implementation
in your php scripts, you can run out of your cpu-resources.
If still the cpu-usage is about 100%, redesign your software or buy a bigger machine ;-)
