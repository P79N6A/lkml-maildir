Even easier is
         if (foobar(.................................)
             + barbar * foobar(bar + foo * oof)) {
         }
since a statement cannot start with binary operators
and as such we are SURE that there must have been something before.
And this matches with old shop owner calculations like:
   1
+  2
+  3
----
   6
which we all know since early math classes.
