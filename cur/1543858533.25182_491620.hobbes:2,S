Please don't use that name, it strikes me as much more confusing than
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL, even though I agree that _GPL doesn't quite convey
what it means, either.
EXPORT_SYMBOL_RESTRICTED?  EXPORT_SYMBOL_DERIVED?  At least something
which is not internally inconsistent would be good (how is something
which is exported "internal?")
And, as long as EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL continues to check that the module
using it has a GPL license, then it really -is- exactly descriptive of
what it's doing and probably shouldn't be changed.  IIMHO.
