Thanks. You should see I sent a new version which fixes several bugs
and cleans up the code a bit.
There might be some areas of potential problems:
- creating and deleting watches on directories with many entries will
   take a long time. Is anyone likely to be creating and destroying
   these things at a very high frequency? Probably nobody cares except
   it might twist some real-time knickers.
- concurrent operations in the same watched directory will incur the
   same scalability penalty. I think this is basically a non-issue since
   the sheer number of events coming out will likely be a bigger problem.
   Doctor, it hurts when I do this.
