I think vger was messed up yesterday, as this did not get through the
first time I sent it, and I did not get any messages from the list for
4-5 hours last night.
I am seeing large latencies (600-2000 usec) latencies in
dcache_readdir.  This started when the machine became a Samba server and
the dcache presumably got large.  Traces are at the above url (8 and 9 I
believe).  I think this patch fixes it.
