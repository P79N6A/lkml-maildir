Hmmm. Actually seems like more of a "which test you pick" thing than a
machine thing. Maybe it's the balance of read / write accesses to the
rwlock that matters, or something.
time dd if=/dev/zero of=foo bs=1 count=1M
with backout:
real    0m4.302s
user    0m0.900s
sys     0m3.370s
With patch: 
real    0m4.016s
user    0m0.810s
sys     0m3.200s
So the patch helps that test at least.
