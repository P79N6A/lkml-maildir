"will it be transparent for all apps?", whether that's worth doing 
depends on the technical implications. Thankfully we have Al and 
Linus to make the judgement call on that ;)
Personally, I think that if GNOME can provide transparency for GNOME 
users, I think that's probably enough - unless there are literally no 
issues in adding some kind of VFS support.
The nano / ls /tar user is likely a very different user to the GNOME 
user. That user is also likely to appreciate the problems with 
backups and such more.
Anyway, userspace transparency is sufficient for most classes of 
users. Only reason to provide some kernel support is if it makes 
sense ("but not all apps can use GNOME transparency" not being one of 
those reasons).
