I think this is the problem: you're using UHCI-HCD. Please, correct me
if I'm wrong but, currently, UHCI-HCD does not work properly after
resuming from suspend (either APM or ACPI).
I have to remote the uhci-hcd module before going to sleep and then,
after waking up, I modprobe it back. At least, It Works For Me(TM) :-)
