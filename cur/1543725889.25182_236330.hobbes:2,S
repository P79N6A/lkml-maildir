It has been a while since I have been able to follow up on this but I want
to let you know that I _have been able_ to reproduce the problem (believed
to be IRQ twiddling resulting in failed spinlock protection) with a stock
kernel.
I would like to come up with a more reliable way to reproduce the problem
with a stock kernel (2.4.26), since it is presently very rare (less than
once per week) in the way I presently get it to happen, but as yet have
not done so.
My plan of attack is to remove irqbalance from the equation and repeatedly
change with random intervals /proc/irq entries directly from one user mode
program while another user mode program does things which inspire a lot of
fs/inode.c spinlock activity (since that is where I continue to see list
corruption).
A few questions which could help me with this:
  - Which IRQ (if any) is used by CPU's to coordinate inter-CPU locking?
  - What does it mean if a stack trace is incomplete?  For example, one I 
    have gotten is simply the tail end of the code snippet:
         0b 9a 00 5d c8
    And so I have wondered if the failure to make a full stack trace 
    indicates something in of itself.
Thanks for any assistance.  I hope to find more time to work on this in
the coming weeks.
Chris
