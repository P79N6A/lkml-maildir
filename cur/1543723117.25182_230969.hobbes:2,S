Greetings;
I may not be subbed to this list, mailbox overflow while I was gone 
for a week. So CC me at my return addy please until I get that 
squared away.
I just rebooted to 2.6.7-mm3, and noticed this bit of whatever in my 
dmesg file:
Serial: 8250/16550 driver $Revision: 1.90 $ 6 ports, IRQ sharing 
enabled
ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
ttyS1 at I/O 0x2f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A

parport: PnPBIOS parport detected.
parport0: PC-style at 0x378, irq 7 [PCSPP,TRISTATE,EPP]
lp0: using parport0 (interrupt-driven).
Using cfq io scheduler
First, the board only has 2 seriel ports, so why is it checking for 6?
Also, the mouse seems to be back to normal, whereas the dbl-click rate 
was maybe 200ms when booted to 2.6.7-mm1, so thats apparently fixed.
Finally, which scheduler is the prefered scheduler now?  I'm using cfq 
because it seems to be more stable for the keyboard autorepeat 
functions where the default can put me well below once per second and 
lag to beat all in kmail.
