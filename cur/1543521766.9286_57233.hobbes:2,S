Hi folks,
I hate to send this message to the whole list, but I have been having lots 
of trouble unsubscribing.  I follow the procedure outlined on the bottom of 
every linux-kernel post, and here's what I get (attached below)
Could someone please let me know what's going on?  My "real" e-mail is
prgrssor@cs.bu.edu...
