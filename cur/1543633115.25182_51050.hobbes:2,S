I looked up that line in the source and found this piece of code:
		full_free = 0;
		p = searchp->slabs_free.next;
		while (p != &searchp->slabs_free) {
			slabp = list_entry(p, slab_t, list);
			if (slabp->inuse)
				BUG();
			full_free++;
			p = p->next;
		}
Could it be a race with this particular slabp being taken in use
by another CPU at this very moment?
