Hi there,
first: I think the problem is solvable with mixing blocking and
non-blocking IO or simply AIO, which will be supported nicely by 2.6.0,
is a POSIX standard and is meant for doing your own IO scheduling.

On dedicated servers this might be true. But on these you could also
solve it in user space by measuring disk bandwidth and issueing just
enough IO to keep up roughly with it.

The vacuum io is submitted (via AIO or simulation of it) normally in a
unit U and waiting ALWAYS for U to complete, before submitting a new one.
Between submitting units, the vacuums checks for outstanding transactions 
and stops, when we have one.
Now a transaction is submitted and the submitting from vacuum is stopped
by it existing. The transaction waits for completion (e.g.  aio_suspend()) 
and signals vacuum to continue.
So the disk(s) should be always in good use.
I don't know much of the design internals of your database, but this
sounds promising and is portable.

Ok, so we can ignore the processing time and the above should just work.
