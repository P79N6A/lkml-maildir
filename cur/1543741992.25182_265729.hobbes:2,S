I use the native (ia32) sparse for m68k cross-builds, using the following trick
(IIRC as suggested by Linus) in arch/m68k/Makefile:
    CHECK := $(CHECK) -D__mc68000__=1 -I$(shell $(CC) -print-file-name=include)
I guess a similar construct would work for other archs, even for native builds.

Hmm, I seem to have 502 hardlinked copies of COPYING, that means at least 502
trees :-)
That's on ext3fs, Athlon XP2800+ with 1 GiB RAM.
And I use same to merge trees after each release.

Just in case you ever want to start doing m68k as well: I already have a few
sparse-related cleanups at
