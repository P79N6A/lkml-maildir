There is some XFS stuff in the dmesg too, that is why I am continuing to 
include the XFS mailing list.  Scroll down to read more.

I have done all you said, and I ran a constant loop w/ vmstat & cat 
/proc/slabinfo toward the end of the file(s) (_after_oom_killer) is when I 
ran:
p34:~# echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
p34:~# echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
p34:~# echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
p34:~# 
The tarball will yield the following files you requested:
4.0K    _proc_meminfo_after_oom_killing.txt
976K    _slabinfo_after_oom_killer.txt
460K    _slabinfo.txt
8.0K    _vmstat_after_oom_killer.txt
4.0K    _vmstat.txt
I am going back to 2.6.20-rc5-6 w/NO-PRE-EMPT, as this was about 10x more 
stable in copying operations and everything else, if you need any more 
diagnostics/crashing(s) in this manner, let me know, because I can make it 
happen every single time with pre-empt on.
And not sure if it matters but when I copy 18gb 18g.2 I have seen it make 
it to various stages:
Attempt size_the 18g.2 got to:
1. 7.8G
2. 4.3G
3. 1.2G
Back to 2.6.20-rc5 w/ no pre-emption, until then/or if/you request 
anything else let me know.  Also I ran echo t > /proc/sysrq-trigger
I have attached THE ENTIRE syslog/kernel dmesg/ring buffer so you'll see 
my system booting up with no problems/errors up until now in which I am 
going back to the old kernel.  This is attached as 
kernel_ring_buffer.txt.bz2
Andrew,
Please let me know if any of this helps!
Justin.
