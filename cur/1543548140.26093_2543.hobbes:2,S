Great.  I'll apply the patch and see where the next breakage is :-P  I
believe there was a problem in the netfilter code
(net/ipv4/netfilter/ipt_REJECT.c, lines 67-68) with the selection of
which xchg() to use (either __xchg_u32() or __xchg_u64()as detailed in
include/asm-alpha/system.h) since it's apparently trying to use
__xchg_called_with_bad_pointer(), which is undefined on purpose.  So
either something's not getting called properly or the detection is messed
up (still have to look into it).
