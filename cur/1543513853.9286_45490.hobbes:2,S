This seems to be a bug (one of several) people reported in the PIII patch so
Im consigning that to the bitbucket.

2.2.13/13ac1 have the same ISDN layer, but Karsten did say that you may need
to recompile the isdn4linux utils. They forgot to bump a number to make sure
users got a warning of this.
Does recompiling the utils help ? (remembering you'll need to recompile them
again with 2.2.12 to go back I believe)
