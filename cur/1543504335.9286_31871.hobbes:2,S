Hello.
I ran across this while testing my driver. I forgot to check for mmap
failure for one case, and it returned -1.
trying to access this space just hung this process, rest of system is fine.
is this a known problem?
i tried a simple program like
main()
{
	int *ptr, i;
	printf("reading illegal ptr\n");
	ptr = (void *) -1;
	i = *ptr;
}
this program never dies or can be killed.? this is 2.2 kernel on 2.0.36 this
one core dumps as expected...
Cheers,
ashokr
Plug-and-Play is really nice, unfortunately it only works 50% of the time.
To be specific the "Plug" almost always works.
