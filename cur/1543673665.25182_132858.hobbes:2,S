           Summary: Laptop keyboard doesn't work
    Kernel Version: 2.5.69 and 2.5.69-bk8
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: vojtech@suse.cz
         Submitter: fxkuehl@gmx.de
Distribution: Debian (Sarge)
Hardware Environment:
Laptop, AMD mobile Athlon XP 2000+
VIA Technologies, Inc. P/KN266 Host Bridge
No external keyboard connected (the thing doesn't even have a PS/2 connector).
Please let me know if there is any more useful information I can supply.
Software Environment:
Problem Description:
I can boot the kernel, but I can't input anything on the keyboard. I'm pretty
sure that this is not due to a bad configuration. I read the post-halloween-2.5
doc and some related bug reports. Here are the relevant parts from my .config:
CONFIG_INPUT=y
CONFIG_SERIO=y
CONFIG_SERIO_I8042=y
CONFIG_INPUT_KEYBOARD=y
CONFIG_KEYBOARD_ATKBD=y
I enabled DEBUG in i8042.c. I'll add the output (with 2.5.69-bk8) from kern.log
as an attachment.
Steps to reproduce:
Boot the system ;-)
