Here's a patch that does the above. I'm not very aware of the issues
around the scheduler so I'm not sure if the cost of going off chip to
the cyclone or ACPI PM time sources are just outright, but for the TSC
case monotonic_clock() is basically the same function as sched_clock().
So this might be the best fix for systems not using the TSC as a time
source. 
I'd be interested to hear if it has any effect on performance.
thanks
