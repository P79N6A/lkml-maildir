s/put/but/
As already mentioned the flash chips have to be erased before they can
be written. The erasesize is much larger than the typical block size
which means that although a block doesn't contain valid data it still
contains something which means that it cannot be written until it was
erased. That's why JFFS2 is using garbage collection to reclaim unused
but (at the moment) unusable space.

Sure. :)
