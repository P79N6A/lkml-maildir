I find it hard to believe any device that can read a DVD doesn't support
UDF.  That would be a very dumb design choice.
UDF was designed for read/write use.  iso9660 was very much designed for
read only.  It is much more complex to update an iso9660 filesystem
after it is created.  It just wasn't meant for it.
