hmm, is this the bugfix you mean? that shouldn't really matter to me as
far I can tell, I did it in an alternate way since the first place.

furthmore I hate those "10" hardwirded magic numbers that you keep
adding. The less of them the better. At least I put those magics in
sysctl.
see what my max_mapped is:
	int orig_max_mapped = SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX * vm_mapped_ratio,
It is controlled by the vm_mapped_ratio and by the swap-cluster. So we
unmap one swap cluster at every vm_mapped_ratio of pages scanned that
were mapped. This ensure we unmap when there's some relevant work to do.
The lower the vm_mapped_ratio, the earlier the kernel will start
swapping/paging. (ah, and of course also the SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX would
better be a sysctl but it isn't yet)
