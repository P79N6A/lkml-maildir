A look at "nfsstat" might help, as might "netstat -s".
In particular, I suggest looking at the "retrans" counter in nfsstat.
When you say that TCP did not help, please note that if retrans is high,
then using TCP with a large value for timeo (for instance -otimeo=600)
is a good idea. It is IMHO a bug for the "mount" program to be setting
default timeout values of less than 30 seconds when using TCP.
Cheers,
  Trond
