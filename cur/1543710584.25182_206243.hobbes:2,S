Alternatively, the mlock()d pages shouldn't appear on the LRU
at all, reusing one of the variables inside page->lru as a
counter to keep track of exactly how many times this page is
mlock()d.

If the page is a normal page on the LRU, I suspect we don't
need to find the VMA, with the exception of mlock()d pages...
Good thing Christoph was already looking at the mlock()d page
counter idea.
