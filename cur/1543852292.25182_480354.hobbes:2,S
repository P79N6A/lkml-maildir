I understand the reason why driver_register() is done by kseriod.

I reorganzed the patch set.
serio driver registration can fail in two different ways.
1) serio_event allocation failure by serio_register_driver().
   It happens in module_init() context. It is possible to check this
   allocation failure by making serio_register_driver() return error.
2) driver_register() failure by kseriod.
   This failure cannot be checked by serio_register_driver().
   But it is necessary to prevent serio_unregister_driver() from
   trying to call driver_unregister() with not registered driver
   by adding flag to serio driver indicating whether registration is
   complete.
1/4: make serio_register_driver() return error -- 1)
2/4: check serio_register_driver() error -- 1)
3/4: check whether serio dirver registration is completed -- 2)
4/4: change to GFP_KERNEL for SERIO_REGISTER_DRIVER event allocation
