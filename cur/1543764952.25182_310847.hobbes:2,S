Thanks Pavel - I've been reading the thread from the other side
of the fence, not understanding the swsusp side of things. :)
There are two ways the xfsbufd thread will wake up - either by its
timer going off (for it to flush delayed write metadata buffers)
or by being explicitly woken up when we're low on memory (in which
case it also flushes out dirty metadata, such that pages can be
cleaned and made available to the system).
Since the refrigerator() call is in place in the main xfsbufd loop,
I suspect we're hitting that second case here, where a low memory
situation is resulting in someone attempting to wakeup xfsbufd --
I'm not sure if this is the right way to check if we're in that
state, but does this patch help?  (it would certainly prevent the
spurious wakeups, but only if the caller has PF_FREEZE set - will
that be the case here?)
cheers.
