                m->buf = kmalloc(m->size <<= 1, GFP_KERNEL);

a) it's not a page; if any ->show() will need more, buffer will grow.
b) unless you are willing to allocate 250Kb per read(), you *can't* do
what you are asking for.  Regardless of implementation.  Which is an
immediate DoS (again, regardless of implementation).
read() is not atomic.  Never had been.  With seq_file you are guaranteed
that what you get will consist of entire entries (IOW, if previous read()
had ended inside the entry, the rest will be preserved for the next read()).
There are no stronger warranties and there never had been.
