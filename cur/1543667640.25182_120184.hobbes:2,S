Subject: [PATCH] warning and unused in sctp.h

Hi,
This patch changes a flags argument to spin_lock_irq_save to unsigned long
and removes its unused attribute.  The first gets rid of several warnings
and the second is "obviously correct" (at least according to Rusty) :-).
Thanks to DaveM for forcing me to build kernels with a 64 cross compiler :-)
