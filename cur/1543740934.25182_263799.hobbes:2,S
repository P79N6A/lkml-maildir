At least until an attacker uploads a malicious module or modifies one of the
(untill then) certified modules. (He can, because your kernel doesn't check
them while loading.)

If your box is r00ted, you'll want to notice this fact and do something
against it. If you don't prevent loading malicious modules, the attacker can
hide his presence and use your system right under your eyes, and you won't
notice (even while checking the checksumes).
Signing modules is (off cause) just one step, the next one(s) would be to
prevent all other modifications to the kernel memory.
