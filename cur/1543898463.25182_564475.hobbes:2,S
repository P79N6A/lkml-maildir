your FAH processes are running with nice +19 - that should be enough to 
throttle them. With v18 you can also mark it SCHED_IDLE:
    schedtool -D $$  # mark the shell idle
SCHED_IDLE gets inherited by child tasks so if you mark the shell that 
starts up FEH as SCHED_IDLE, all FEH threads should be SCHED_IDLE too. 
(or you can start it up via schedtool -D -e ... )
does it still get more CPU time than you'd expect it to get? A reniced 
or SCHED_IDLE task will 'fill in' any idle time that it senses, so in 
itself it's not an anomaly if a task gets 50% and FEH fills in the 
remaining 50%. Does it still get CPU time if you start two CPU hogs:
   for (( N=0; N < 2; N++ )); do ( while :; do :; done ) & done
? If yes, that would be an anomaly.

great! :-)
