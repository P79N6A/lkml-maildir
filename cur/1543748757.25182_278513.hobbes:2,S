The patch only does HZ at dynamic time. But of course it's absolutely
trivial to define it at compile time, it's probably a 3 liner on top of
my current patch ;). However personally I don't think the three liner
will worth the few seconds more spent configuring the kernel ;).
The HZ cacheline is pure readonly (actually I'm not defining it as
cacheline_aligned, I probably should, __HZ can go together with
__SHIFT_HZ). The only debug option I introduced (because it could have a
performance penalty) is a check that nobody ever attempts to read HZ
before we initialized it by parsing the boot command line. If that
happens I printk and then I fallback to the fixed-HZ, so machine works
fine even in case of bugs and I get the debugging printk. That code
actually never triggered once. I did it primarly during development to
be sure I could debug fast troubles with other archs (this is already
running in all archs with SLES8).
This is pretty much the core of the patch:

+
+static inline unsigned long get_hz(void)
+{
+#ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_HZ

+}
