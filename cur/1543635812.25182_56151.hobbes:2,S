Its actually -extremely- reliable. Simply because we've kept the
behaviour constant over time.

There is a BIOS extension for this (EDID 3.0 I believe). It only
addresses where the boot device went, not how to sort the IDE device
ordering and the like

Forget about modprobe. The areas this bites people are areas where the
ordering is compiled in stuff (eg IDE) and where you have multiple of
the same controller.
A good example here is that many systems order devices internally based
on mainboard versus external. Dell do this a lot. That ordering happens
not to be the pci scan order some times.
Even with BIOS help you have to know this. And with only the basic BIOS
you have to know the full ROM initialisation ordering, which is -very-
non trivial for complex systems.

Finding the rootfs by label is a minor problem, figuring out how to name
the controllers consistently between 2.2/2.4/2.6 is a showstopper in the
real world even if its not in happy hackerdom.
