   I think there is a virt_to_bus() macro and its inverse.
Which is deprecate and not to be used by any new code.
Use Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt instead.
If you meant virt_to_phys(), this does not work on arbitrary
kernel virtual addresses either only direct mapped ones
(ie. kmalloc() or get_free_page() data).
