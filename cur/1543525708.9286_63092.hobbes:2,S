I've used 2.3.18,19,20,21,41,42 but I can't compile 2.3.43 or 2.3.44 here
is a copy of my configs I wish I could fix it but can't code yet so I hope
I can help debug cause I'd really like to upgrade from 2.3.42. I'm also
running debian woody. 
first on make dep I get:
make[6]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-2.3.44/net/irda/compressors'
Makefile:1: *** missing separator.  Stop.
make[6]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.3.44/net/irda/compressors'
make[5]: *** [_sfdep_compressors] Error 2
make[5]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.3.44/net/irda'
make[4]: *** [fastdep] Error 2

make[1]: *** [_sfdep_net] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.3.44'
make: *** [dep-files] Error 2
then on make bzImage I get:
