hmm... I had the same problem as the original poster with 4.0, not with
4.1 and rawhides 4.2 XFree86 packages won't even let me start up with
dri+OpenGL (different problem).  I will try to rebuild X from source
tonight see if I can garner some insight.

yes, I get/got this too, hasn't happened recently, but then again X
hasn't crashed recently.  Another thing (I believe was fbdev related)
was the screwing up of the fonts (! missing the dot at the bottom,
etc.).  I believe that was fixed circa 2.4.17/2.5.2 .

yes, same as above, this is a rather coincidental about the HW configs.
I have a dual celeron (famous bp6 config) with vodoo3 with dri and agp
enabled.
