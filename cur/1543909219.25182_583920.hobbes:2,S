Two issues in this mail, sorry if I'd have done better to separate them.
One: Thinkpad T43p suspend-to-RAM regression.
Verily, what Len giveth with one hand, he taketh away with the other.
Henrique's fix to CONFIG_THINKPAD_ACPI_INPUT_ENABLED default is now in,
thanks, so Fn-F4 ought now to Suspend to RAM on the Thinkpad T43p.
Except that it doesn't.
Git bisection (with manual fixups to i386 mmiocfg horror, thanks
for drawing attention to that in your changelog) accuses Alexey's
ACPI: EC: If ECDT is not found, look up EC in DSDT
cd8c93a4e04dce8f00d1ef3a476aac8bd65ae40b
and if I revert that along with Len's subsequent
ACPI: EC: fix build warning
52fe4bdf40bc07498c5f7935551774e8f8458190
then I have Fn-F4 suspending to RAM again.
It's not obvious to me how Alexey's patch might be interfering with
Thinkpad STR, but of course I can try any patches suggested.  Hmm,
does "echo mem >/sys/power/state" work instead?  Apparently, except
then we cannot resume after, the screen remains blank - though I'm
not in the habit of using /sys/power/state, maybe that's unrelated.
Two: oddity noticed in doing that git bisection.
I'd told it v2.6.23-rc2 good and v2.6.23-rc3 bad.  Happily rebooting
various versions of 2.6.23-rc2-git (CONFIG_LOCALVERSION="-git").
Caught by surprise when I realized that actually the last few kernels
it had built were actually 2.6.23-rc1-git.  Bisection log below from
a correct second attempt: git --version 1.5.2.4.
Is that right?  I realize that git is not linear (and "git bisect
visualize" had shown me James steaming up a branch line past Gordon
and Thomas and Trevor); but I had imagined that tags set barriers
past which commits might not move later (and if tags don't do that,
then I'm unclear what purpose tags do serve).
Or was Len's tree lacking something when you pulled from it?
Thanks,
Hugh
