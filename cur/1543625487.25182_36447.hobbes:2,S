On the 5510/5520 bugs in the timers prevent use getting the TSC/delay
calibrated. This works ok on the 5530. I also saw some really bizarre goings
on with the TSC on some devices like joystick.
The older kernels kill TSC on any MediaGX (but will miss newer geodes due
to the cpuid change). Current one will kill tsc on 5510/5520 and knows
the new geode idents
