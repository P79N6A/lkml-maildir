OK, I use spin_lock_irqsave first, and then I only use spin_lock when I
already know interrupts are off.  But the locks I usually use are used by
interrupts and that is reason enough to use it.  I wouldn't use the
_irqsave for simplicity, I use it since I still believe it keeps latency
down for SMP.
