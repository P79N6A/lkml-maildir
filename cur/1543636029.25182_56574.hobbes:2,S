From nfs(5), mount options:
   hard    If an NFS file operation has a major timeout then report
           "server not responding" on the console and continue
           retrying indefinitely.  This is the default.
   intr    If an NFS file operation has a major timeout and it is hard
           mounted, then allow signals to interupt the file operation
           and cause it to return EINTR to the calling program.  The
           default is to not allow file operations to be interrupted.
You want both these options when mounting. It might be possible to do a
"mount -o remount,intr /hung/nfs/mount" and then kill, but I'm not sure.
