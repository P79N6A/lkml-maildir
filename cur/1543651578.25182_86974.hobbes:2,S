We are not concerned with power use.
What it is we are running is a math intensive program.  When the sub uses
the idle flag and run their test they get a run time of 370ms, when they do
not use the flag they get a run time of 255ms.  Yes I know that 115ms is not
much of a difference, but in our application it could be.  I have asked them
to send me a copy of their sim so that I may attempt to reproduce it here
and reevaluate our kernel build options.
We need to do much more testing.  My opinion is that we won't be able to
decide until we get all of the pieces into system integration.

It actually depends on what you are doing whether it has any impact.
Also of course if power use is a consideration
