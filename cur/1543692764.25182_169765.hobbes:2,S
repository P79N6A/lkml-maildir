Yes I know. I was only talking about non-RT, I was concerned about
sigterm/sigkill primarly, that is the only realistic scenario. If you
send SIGRTMIN that is a pilot error, the system will never attempt to do
that, while it's not so obvious for sigterm. That's why I said at least
not more than 1 signal will be queued.

It's up to you, I believe what we have to fix is the kupdate, the
SIGRTMIN can't matter. At most we can care about the sigterm, but even
the sigterm if it happens, it happens at shutdown time, so at the end it
doesn't matter much either for most systems (and that one isn't a leak,
only some minor memory lost).
So I guess you can fix only kupdate, and care to add the flush_signals
only in 2.6 that has the very same problem.
