Yes I am using the same .config file from 2.4.20-pre10 on 
2.4.20-pre10aa1 (of course I run make oldconfig, and accept the default 
setting that shows up on 2.4.20-pre10aa1)
I think you are right, it has something to do with the kernel modules.

Ok. That didn't really help. Kernel compiled for i386 even crashes, but 
the k7 optimised kernel crashes at the Athlon speed :-)

My computer has 512 MB RAM. No highmem.
I am able to trigger the issue (after 3 attempts [1]) with,
CONFIG_AGP m
CONFIG_AGP_AMD y
CONFIG_DRM y
CONFIG_DRM_RADEON m
While I couldn't trigger the issue (after 5 attempts [1]) without them. 
Hence I suspect it may be something to do with them. But it takes a lot 
of time to test these all, I think I will have good answers in couple of 
days time considering the amount of time it takes to perform the tests.
[1]
1. Login to XFree86/Gnome
2. Start Mozilla, Evolution, OpenOffice Writer/Calc/Impress, Konqueror, 
KMail. And exit them all.
3. mke2fs -j /dev/hdc9; mount /dev/hdc9 /test;cd /test;dd if=/dev/zero 
of=zero bs=1024 count=2097152;cd /
4. Redo the step 2
5. Log out and log in and redo step 2
6. Unmount /test
Repeat the above test cycle few times (on 3rd attempt or so) the system 
oops (when I had AGP/AMD/DRM/Radeon stuff).
Thanks for your help.
