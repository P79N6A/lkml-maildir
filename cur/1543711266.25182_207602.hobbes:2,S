I have this kernel:
Linux abyss 2.4.20-4GB #1 Sat Feb 7 02:07:16 UTC 2004 i686 unknown
unknown GNU/Linux
I believe it is reasonably  recent one from Hubert's kernels.
The thing is the performance is different if file grows or it does not.
If it does - we have some 25 fsync/sec. IF we're writing to existing
one, we have some 1600 fsync/sec 
In the former case cache is surely not flushed.

2.4 does flush in one case but not in other. 2.6 does not do it in ether
case.
I was also surprised to see this simple test case has so different
performance with default and "deadline" IO scheduler   -  1.6 vs 0.5 sec
per 1000 fsync's.
