Rather then change the meaning of time_t, why not define an new value of
epoch_t which is currently zero. That way software can be converted
gradually and old software will continue to work unchanged. The
infrastructure will use the epoch_t value to do things the right way.
Given the recent Y2K scare, getting a label that says your software is
2038 compliant should be powerful marketting material in 10-15 years.
