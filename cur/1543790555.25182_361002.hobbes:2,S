Thanks for the effort. :-) I know I'm sometimes a bit difficult to 
understand, which makes it easier to simply flame me for a silly mistake.

Yes.

You're correct. I missed that comparison, so if clock resolution and timer 
resolution are equal, this indeed works.
It still goes wrong if the resolutions are different. get_time() normally 
wouldn't use jiffies but xtime. Thomas uses a fixed resolution, but xtime 
updates are not constant. On my machine here with HZ=250 the resolution 
would be 4000000ns, but xtime is updated by about 4000150ns every tick. 
This means the timer value is rounded to full 4ms, but this is not enough 
to get it past the next tick.
In the other more common case, where clock resolution is smaller than the 
timer resolution, this means the delay may be larger than really 
necessary.
bye, Roman
