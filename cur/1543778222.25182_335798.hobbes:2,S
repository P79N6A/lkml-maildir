in your ACPI example there is a bug/problem (ACPI needs updating).
And ACPI is a good example where even 1000 success reports wouldn't help 
because a slightly different hardware or BIOS version might make the 
difference.
Usually "no bug report" indicates that something is OK.
And if you are unsure whether an unusual setup or hardware is actually 
tested, it's usually the best to ask on linux-kernel whether someone 
could test it.
