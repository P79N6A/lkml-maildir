OK, but I have rev c1 of the M5229 and still can't understand the
results.
As I already reported:

Identical disks, both have DMA enabled in the BIOS and have different
benchmark results. Strange.
>> ALI15X3: Ultra DMA enabled
>> hdc: IBM-DJNA-351520, 14664MB w/430kB Cache, CHS=29795/16/63, (U)DMA
This is confusin wrt your explanation. UDMA enabled so driver believes
that chipset is UDMA capable. But the (U)DMA indicates that the chipset
is not UDMA capable. How can the second interface be worse than the
first? Or is it just a reporting bug (since the driver runs _fast_ and
it certainly looks like it uses udma).
>> ALI15X3: MultiWord DMA enabled
>> hdd: ATAPI 40X CD-ROM drive, 128kB Cache, (U)DMA
OK, this was pio in bios and gets assigned multiword dma.
But why is there the (U)DMA string again? If the drive supports UDMA
then the bios should have initialized it to udma, right?
