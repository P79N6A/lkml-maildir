Still behaves the same way with a stock 2.6.0-test2.  I applied the 
patch you included to 2.6.0-test2.  Same strange dual-insertion behavior 
was noted.
Also, I have another laptop, Intel based, that doesn't show this 
behavior.  So it's something to do with this one.

Here's what happens on the console.  If you want kern.log, let me know 
and I'll send that along.  I don't see anything different between them.
After the laptop finishes booting, the PCMCIA network card (tulip 
driver) is not running.
I remove the card:
    parse_events: socket df5cd82c thread df60e060 events 00000080
    socket df5cd82c status 00001c00
I insert the card:
    parse_events: socket df5cd82c thread df60e060 events 00000080
    socket df5cd82c status 00001c80
    socket_insert: skt df5cd82c
    socket_setup: skt df5cd82c status 00001c80
    socket_reset: skt df5cd82c
    Linux Tulip driver version 1.1.13 (May 11, 2002)

I remove the card:
    parse_events: socket df5cd82c thread df60e060 events 00000080
    socket df5cd82c status 00001c00
    socket_remove: skt df5cd82c
    socket_shutdown: skt df5cd82c status 00001c80
 
I insert the card:
    (nothing at all)
I remove the card:
    parse_events: socket df5cd82c thread df60e060 events 00000080
    socket df5cd82c status 00001c00
