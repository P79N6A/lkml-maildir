Strange indeed.  300k in swap is nothing - I often enough
have 50M in swap without a slowdown - but then, I don't
run kde. 
Be aware that the 300k in swap doesn't account for all that
is removed from memory.  Linux don't put executable code
in swap - such stuff is simply dropped because it can
be reloaded from the executable files anytime.
I don't think swapoff+swapon helps with that though.
