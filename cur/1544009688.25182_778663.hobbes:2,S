I'm sure that others could give more usecases, but I was thinking about 
cases like "I want to test _these_ multiple metrics simultaneously over 
_this_ specific section of code".  In a case like this, it seems 
desirable to start/stop the various performance counters as close 
together as possible, especially if the section of code being tested is 
short.
