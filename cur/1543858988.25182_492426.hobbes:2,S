 I'm pleased to announce a new "util-linux-ng" project. This project
 is a fork of the original util-linux (2.13-pre7). 
 The goal of the project is to move util-linux code back to useful state, sync
 with actual distributions and kernel and make development more transparent end
 open.
 The short term goals (for 2.13 release):
	- remove all NFS code from util-linux-ng 
          (/sbin/mount.nfs from nfs-utils is replacement)
	- remove FS/device detection code
          (libblkid from e2fsprogs or libvolumeid is replacement)
	- move as much as possible patches from distributions to upstream
