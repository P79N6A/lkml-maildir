And then converted back to ASCII for printout on the terminal ;-).

Amen.
The true problem with /proc and user land applications is that around 6
years
ago people did just give up on adapting the parsers to the ever chaning
"wonderfull" ascii interfaces those times. The second problem is that
/proc
is one of the few design "inventions" in linux, which didn't get copied
over
from some other UNIX box and Linus doesn't wan't recognize that this was
A BAD DESIGN CHOICE.
