mmm, a new version. The previous one was some year old.

Sorry for bad english, and bad logic.
I said that you could see this behaivour also with 2.0. kernels.
With 2.2 kernels this behaviour disapperared. Now I never tried e2defrag
with 2.4 kernels, since I use reiserFS and JFS now, but my idea
was that probably the different buffer cache management is involved, as it
was with 2.0.
Sorry for bad logic, it is too mutch time that i do not sleep :).
