I just noted, that maybe (*if*) build/link time have been affected.
There was an example of size reduction, why not to have timings also?
I guess, developer can spend time tuning written driver with that
option/patch. But what you will write in the help message for
testers/users? In this case build time is important obviously. Runtime
isn't affected at all, except, maybe, ~1% increase in bzImage unzipping.
Whatever.

Do you mean hand-waving?

I was talking about introducing such things in development process.
Current kconfig may be not flexible, it must not lead to further problems
and silver-bullet solutions.

Not first time i see, what i should do. Thank you very much, Adrian!
You know better, what i know. Great.
Then say from the beginning that you're not interested in reviewing
and view-exchanging process, you know better, what i should do. Thus, i
will not waste my time explaining anything.
Whatever.
