consider this example:
	'
http://www.site.org/index.html
'
That is, run the object of that URL as a program, same as you would
compiled code, or a shell script, or a Java class.  That should be
interesting.  Someone's going to want it pretty soon, if for no other
reason than that Win32 can do it:
	C:/> START 
http://www.site.org/index.html
What it means on Win32 is to run your default Web browser and pass it that
URL.  This takes a pile of code in ShellExecute() and a fair amount of
data in the (pardon my language) Registry.  Think about it.

A Brazil-nut is neatly packaged and tightly integrated.  To turn it into
food, you must crack and remove the shell.  I find that I feel the same   
way about an increasing number of software products.  *sigh*
