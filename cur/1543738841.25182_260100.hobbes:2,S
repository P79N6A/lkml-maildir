Chris, did you try the patch I sent you (it's in mainline now, so if you
re-test on 2.6.9-rc4 you'd pick it up)?  With that patch, with 2G of
memory and no swap, my machine did not lock up, and the conditions that
the patch protect against were triggered.  And, with the patch backed
out, kswapd spins out of control.  I believe this is fixed.
thanks,
-chris
