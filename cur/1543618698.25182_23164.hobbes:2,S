Granted.  "if (x)" is true if "x" is non-zero, regardless of type and
shoudn't even generate a warning if "x" is scalar.
Either printf() will occur depending on whether automatics are
initialized to zero or not.  The first one will most likely print
since there's 255 to 1 odds that "x" will be non-zero if not
initialized and I don't think gcc initializes automatics.
