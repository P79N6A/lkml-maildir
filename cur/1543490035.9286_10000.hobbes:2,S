I've already posted this patch to linux-scsi, but I thought people here
might be interested. It is a patch to the scsi cdrom driver to disable
audio/multisession capabilities for SCSI-1/SCSI-1 CCS cdrom drives. It
checks the scsi revision of the cdrom drive, and will mask out cdrom
capability flags that indicate audio/multisession capabilities for the
drive if the drive isn't SCSI-2. Otherwise the uniform cdrom driver &
scsi multisession code will think the drive is capable of audio ioctls,
and the scsi commands associated with the audio ioctls are not SCSI-1
friendly.
This is a problem even if no attempt to play an audio cd is ever made
with such a drive. The uniform cdrom driver tries to read a cd's TOC
when the device is opened, in order to determine what types of tracks a
disc contains (audio, data, etc). This operation is an audio ioctl. The
associated scsi commands are not recognized by older cdrom drives that
aren't SCSI-2 compatible. However, the driver won't make such an attempt
if it knows that the drive in question is not audio-capable.
I've also made a one-line patch to the uniform cdrom driver to fix a
small omission in the check of a drive's audio capabilites before trying
to read the disc TOC. It's already been submitted to the Uniform CDROM
Driver maintainer, but I've included it here as well.
