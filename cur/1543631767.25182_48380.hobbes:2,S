Oh, yes it is.  GPL and commercial DO NOT COVER EVERYTHING, damnit.
And I don't fscking care for Oracle, IBM, etc. - there are folks doing
stuff under other free licenses and I find casual dismissing them
from consideration disgusting at extreme.  Especially if you take care

and from Oracle.  Good ideas we are using.  Shame...
