the crux of it is this patch:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/auto-qa-patches/Kconfig-qa.patch
(ontop of x86.git)
adjust your arch/x86/Kconfig.needed whitelist (should already work on 
typical systems) and do a 'make randconfig'. Every config is supposed to 
build and boot fine, including 'make allnoconfig' and 'make 
allyesconfig'. And please let me know about any blacklist items as well. 
(right now they are a bit hacky via a "depends on 0" line and a small 
comment explaining why they are not suitable in a bzImage kernel.)
( the CONFIG_BOOTPARAM stuff is there to easily randomize boot options - 
we frequently have regressions that only trigger with certain boot 
option combinations. )
it's somewhat hackish in places. The rest of my scripts (to scp a new 
kernel image, to reboot a testbox, etc.) tie in to my specific 
environment quite closely and make no sense to be posted. (they are also 
quite ugly)
