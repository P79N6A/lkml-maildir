More accurately if DEBUG_KERNEL is not set you won't get the menuconfig
entry to set it *and* whatever manual changes you to to it in your
.config won't be taken into account.
Which is just plain stupid - if it's linked this hard to DEBUG_KERNEL
what the hell is it doing in another config section ? It's not like it
depended on another option (like usb-storage on usb & scsi). I missed it
both in menuconfig (duh - didn't thought of re-reading the whole menu
structure after enabling debug) and during manual .config edit.
(anyway you solved my problem at light speed and for this you're my day
god - thanks a lot)
