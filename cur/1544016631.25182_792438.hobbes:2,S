SLES11 will ship with SLAB, FWIW. As I said in the SLQB thread, this was
not due to my input. But I think it was probably the right choice to make
in that situation.
The biggest problem with SLAB for SGI I think is alien caches bloating the
kmem cache footprint to many GB each on their huge systems, but SLAB has a
parameter to turn off alien caches anyway so I think that is a reasonable
workaround.
Given the OLTP regression, and also I'd hate to have to deal with even
more reports of people's order-N allocations failing... basically with the
regression potential there, I don't think there was a compelling case
found to use SLUB (ie. where does it actually help?).
I'm going to propose to try to unblock the problem by asking to merge SLQB
with a plan to end up picking just one general allocator (and SLOB).
Given that SLAB and SLUB are fairly mature, I wonder what you'd think of
taking SLQB into -mm and making it the default there for a while, to see
if anybody reports a problem?
