Can you try 2.6.1 with Andi's latest patchset from here:
ftp://ftp.x86-64.org/pub/linux/v2.6/x86_64-2.6.1-2.bz2
There's been quite a few updates to AMD oustanding since before 2.6.0 
that Andi said were critical.
If it's still bust, could you fish around in /var/log/messages or consoles 
for any stack traces or anything you can see?
