Hmm, I don't know. Forking one of {Linux,{Free,Net,Open}BSD} or some other
Open Source OS and redoing the API and some of the guts in a better way
without being backwardly compatible has its advantages. I agree that
'monolithic' is on its way out, but very slowly. A monolothic kernel with a
new API would be an interesting and useful 'toy' even if it never hit the
mainstream. It would also be a good way of testing API features for future
more advanced OSs, as monolithic kernels have the advantage of (relative)
simplicity and widespread comprehension.
