[I didn't notice this when I first replied]
Because of the RTC's low resolution and of how the calibration is
implemented in the chip, you need to sample the clock at intervals of
several hours in order to determine the direction of the required
adjustment.  Repeatedly setting the RTC to the correct time will
actually prevent correct calibration.
