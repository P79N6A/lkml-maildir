Serial console (Documentation/serial-console.txt).  Run a null modem to
a second machine and capture it there, even an 8086 running DOS 2 will
do the job.  And before you ask, no we cannot save the log somewhere
and pick it up later.  There was a recent thread on this and PC's do
not have anywhere safe (disk I/O is not safe in a panic) and reliable
(most BIOS's clear or corrupt memory on boot) to store the log.
