It depends entirely on the usage pattern.  I can imagine this sort of
use:
  mmap
  write lots of data to memory
  msync(MS_ASYNC)
  overwrite previous data
  msync(MS_ASYNC)
  ...
In this case write protecting and faulting the pages will be slower,
than just checking the page tables.

I don't think this is dubious.  The pte dirty bit in this case means,
that the page was modified _since_the_last_call_ of this function.
The PG_dirty on the other hand means, that the page will need to be
written back.  So they have completely different meanings.
Thanks,
