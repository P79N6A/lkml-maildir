Read the source code. The driver never reloads the firmware on a running
card. So if the sparc needed that it never worked anyway, and I don't follow
your argument.
If you do need to reload the firmware on real live sparc setups after driver
setup then someone needs to do some patching.
Unlike you, I actually read the source
