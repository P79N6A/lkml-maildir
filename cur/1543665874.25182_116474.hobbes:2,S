Hi John,
I like the idea of making the monotonic clock use the same
mechanism as the normal timeofday clock.
When I was doing my alternative Posix timers patch, I modified
your get_offset() mechanism to return nanoseconds and added a
"struct time_spec ytime" which was updated in the same place as
xtime but was never set.
You might have a look at my patch archived here:
  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=104006731324824&w=2
Look for the function do_gettime_sinceboot_ns().  You don't have to 
keep the monotonic time in cycles.  It
would be nice if the timeofday clock was defined as the monotonic
clock + an offset.
Also, if I had one of those cyclone counters, I would never look at
the PIT again.
