Ok, it's in the last six candidates, so yeah, I'm pretty sure. I'll do a 
final compile/boot cycle to verify, but if you don't hear from me, you can 
pretty much assume that was it.
Thomas, Ingo, I'd _really_ like to get -rc3 out there, but I'd like to cut 
down the regression list a bit, and a number of them were about resume 
from RAM, and this is probably it. So I'd *really* like to get this one 
nailed, especially since the causing commit is known. Can you look at it 
as a high-priority thing, please?
I don't see anything interesting in my logs.

	Time: acpi_pm clocksource has been installed.
	Real Time Clock Driver v1.12ac
	hpet_acpi_add: no address or irqs in _CRS

(I also see "Time: tsc clocksource has been installed." on some boots)
