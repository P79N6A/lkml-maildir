btw., regarding #2 i hereby put my patch (which i wrote in my free time) 
into the public domain - feel free to reuse it in any way, shape or 
form, under any license. (but it's trivial enough so i guess the only 
copyrightable element is my changelog entry anyway ;)

well its in the kernel so it's size critical by definition. But it's 
certainly not a highprio thing.
