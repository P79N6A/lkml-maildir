Subject: in_atomic doesn't count local_irq_disable?

Hi,
	I am getting messages like:
 "Debug: sleeping function called from invalid context at include/linux/rwsem.h:45"
 "in_atomic: 0, irqs_disabled(): 1"
while running some (CPU Hotplug) tests against (2.6.0-test11-bk6 + the CPU hotplug patch).
This is basically because down_read was called with interrupts disabled ..
__might_sleep was "unable" to dump the stack of callers which 
lead to this problem ..
I put some debug code in down_read (an inline function) and found
that down_read was actually called from do_page_fault.
do_page_fault avoids calling this down_read if we are "in_atomic()"
Isn't in_atomic supposed to count IRQs disabled case? If not
then shouldn't do_page_fault also check for irqs_disabled() 
before calling down_read()?
Please let me know what I am missing here!
