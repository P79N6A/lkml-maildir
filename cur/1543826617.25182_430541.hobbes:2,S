Did you want me to do something like this:
http://www.fi.muni.cz/~xslaby/sklad/usbmon/?M=A
usb2 means usb bus 2.
without "a"s commands was:
[connect the device]
mount /dev/sdb usb/ [filesystem is vfat]
dd if=/dev/zero of=usb/zero1 bs=1k count=3
[wait some time to let system syncing automagically]
umount usb/
[disconnect the device]
with "a" there is only difference in dd command:
...
dd if=/dev/zero of=usb/zero2 bs=1k count=5
...
The first serie is without the error in the latter one appeared (some time after
`dd', when system syncs):
sd 6:0:0:0: SCSI error: return code = 0x10070000
end_request: I/O error, dev sdb, sector 8223
[same as before]
I have i386 arch, so 4096 is PAGE_SIZE, when it syncs only one dirty page, it
seems to be OK, otherwise it's not, if this helps in any way.
thanks,
