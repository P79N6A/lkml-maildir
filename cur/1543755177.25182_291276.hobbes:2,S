Hi,
  If it is possible to add some process data to a file descriptor structure in 
Linux? So the file descriptor could either save a list of proc pointers or a 
list of PID values. It this list could be made, then sockets could be easily 
identified using process control block hash table. Does anybody know if it is 
possible?
 thanks
