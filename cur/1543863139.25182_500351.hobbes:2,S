I got these results with a customized 2.6.20-rc5.

There is some deviation in the results between these 2 kernels. Is
this acceptable?

I would be trying to benchmark the results on my machines in this
fashion (overclocking experiment):-
Disk Types                                       Machine
                            RAM
SATA 1.5 GBPS  - 160 GB           P4-HT-3.0 GHz
   2x1GB Corsair
SATA 3.0 GBPS  -  320 GB          P4-HT-3.0 GHz
   2x1GB Corsair
SATA 1.5 GBPS  -  160 GB           P4-HT-3.0 GHz
   2x1GB OCZ
SATA 3.0 GBPS  -   320 GB           P4-HT-3.0 GHz
    2x1GB OCZ
SATA 1.5 GBPS  -  160 GB              P4-HT-3.0 GHz
    2x1GB Supertalent
SATA 3.0 GBPS  -   320 GB             P4-HT-3.0 GHz
    2x1GB Supertalent
SATA 1.5 GBPS  -  160 GB             P4-HT-3.0 GHz
    2x1GB Hynix
SATA 3.0 GBPS  -   320 GB            P4-HT-3.0 GHz
     2x1GB Hynix
Boards here would be used are Intel based 915, 965, and 975.
Would be happy to know more test cases - for RAM/Disk/Processor Frequency
And, I don't work for any magazine, writing a review ;-)
