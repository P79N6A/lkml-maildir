Can't be. Or: mips supports 7 arguments and parisc doesn't pad.
Otherwise they couldn't have wired up
sys_sync_file_range(int fd, loff_t offset, loff_t nbytes, unsigned int flags)
But from what I read, it's currently not possible for 32-bit powerpc to
wire up the already present sync_file_range system call.
