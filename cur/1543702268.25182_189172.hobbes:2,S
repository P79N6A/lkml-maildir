My understanding is that you need both.  And if we used the
pci_enable_relaxed() routine, we'd have to add a check to readX() for it
so that we don't accidentally set the RO bit in the transaction when the
command word has it clear.

I don't know of any that do it automatically...

So this wouldn't be helpful for your chipset then.

Ahh... that's a bit of a stretch of the definition of non-coherence I
think, but it might be close enough to use the sync semantics.

Right, that's another option--adding a pci_sync_consistent() call.

All of them are pretty easy enough to do...  so I see our options as one
of the following:
  1) add pcix_enable_relaxed() and read_relaxed() (read() would always be
     ordered)
  2) add pcix_enable_relaxed() and read_ordered() (read() would be
     relaxed after the pcix_enable_relaxed() call)
  3) add pcix_enable_relaxed() and pci_sync_consistent() (read() would
     be relaxed after the pcix_enable_relaxed() call)
Thanks,
Jesse
