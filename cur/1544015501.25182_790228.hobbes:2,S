I'll see if I can give it a test drive sometime in the next 24 hours or so.
One unanswered question:  What do we expect the system to do if they have this
patch, TIGON3=y, FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL=n, and configure a netconsole for boot
messages?  I'm *hoping* the answer is "the netconsole doesn't come up at boot,
but can be re-enabled via the /sys/kernel/config/netconsole interface after
you've done an 'ifconfig eth0 up' or similar, or do a 'modprobe netconsole'.
Those seem like reasonable semantics to me - anybody got a different opinion?
