Yes, but the 500Kb _must_ be there for grabs, always; independent of
whatever strange stuff the system is doing ATM. So the 2+Gb for emacs have
to be available, or you can't even do a dired (which forks an ls, there is
no way the OS can know what the new child will do with its (totally
legitimate!) memory area. Remember Linux uses COW on fork(2)). Or you start
sash in a way that is never, ever requests extra memory when booting, and
use that to fix thigs up.
Both are solutions, both might be appropiate under certain circumstances.
No use for me, though.

A runaway user program will squeeze the legitimate root processes into your
reserved area, and you loose anyway.

Disk space management _is_ different, you don't create a new file by
copying an existing (possibly huge) file and overwrite it with a much
smaller one all the time. Also, disk space is used in rather permanent
fashion, memory use is ephemeral.

How does the kernel know that the new process is The Master Himself,
showing up to fix things up, and not yet aother ftpd forked off, or Joe
Random Luser trying to log in?

Suspend sshd, init and X then. Exactly as useful as killing them, just that
you don't gain any memory that way.
