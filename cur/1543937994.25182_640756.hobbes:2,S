The saa7146 is a generic chipset that is used on quite a few different
cards. You only compiled and inserted the generic driver core for the
saa7146.

No.
You are missing the extension module for the specific card you have.
For example, if you have a so-called "Multimedia eXtension Board", you
need to insert the "mxb.ko" driver as well.
Please tell me what kind of card that is, ie. brand, manufacturer, card
id etc. so I can tell you if there is a driver that supports it or not.

Best regards
Michael.
