Our local APIC PM code saves the local APIC state and disables it
before suspend, and restores it and reenables the local APIC after
resume.

Do you use APM? How do you suspend? With "apm --suspend" or by e.g.
closing the lid? In the latter case, does your APM BIOS post the
suspend event to us before actually suspending?
An APM BIOS that crashes in SMM code before posting the suspend event,
or that skips posting the event altogether, probably won't work with
an enabled local APIC. Not much we can do about that.
