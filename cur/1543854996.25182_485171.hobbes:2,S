I'm not sure we do. What the Jmicron drivers do is
- If SATA (libata) is enabled (module or built in) then turn on AHCI
- If it is not enabled then support the chip fully in SFF mode via
drivers/ide
As the AHCI mode is fundamentally better (both with respect to standards
and to performance) this makes sense.
I think the SB600 should do the same - if support is in the
kernel/modules - then turn on AHCI mode. If not then don't. No user
options needed, no complex config questions.
