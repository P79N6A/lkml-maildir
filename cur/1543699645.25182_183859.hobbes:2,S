Okay, we are probably taking other sounds. I can hear cpu-load-related
noise on every notebook from thinkpad 560X -- in a quiet room, and on
some machines its rather hard to notice. You probably have way more
annoying problem.

I wonder what happens at 200kHz then; system might detect some lost
ticks and keep running at very slow speed...
