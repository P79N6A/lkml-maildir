Hi all.
This error was stucked in since raid-0.90-something-in-november-last IIRC, and now w/ tigher
integration into official kernel tree, it should be corrected (actually it should be corrected
months ago, but...)
The location of md.h is not under <linux/>, but inside <linux/raid/>.
Is a little thing, since no much people uses this disk array from Compaq :)
Cheers,
