Of course it is, it points to a bus area - that doesn't mean it is
valid to access it directly.

Because we are then adding typedef's for random things for little
reason. Whether a pointer is a bus address typedef or an unsigned long
makes little different, buggy code can still put whatever broken
address into it.

32 bit PCI does dual address cycles, it's not just wrong on 64 bit
PCI. Besides that then you are implicitly stating that a bus address
== PCI bus address.

Most of this is due to the fact that many programmers expect all
architectures to work like the x86. The bus address handling is the
least of the problem here.

BARF, in English that is also called "make life painful for the people
who writes the code for the sake of making life painful"
