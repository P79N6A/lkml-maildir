The patch apparently fixes the problem that I have reported, so thanks a lot, 
Pavel.  After it's been fixed, however, I often get things like that:
PM: snapshotting memory.

suspend: Allocating pagedir failed.
It's sort of strange, because there were 250 meg of RAM available, out of 500, 
at that time.
Anyway I was able to suspend the machine after the above one had happened (I 
stopped an app occupying some memory and then the box suspended), but then I 
got a spectacular crash on resume (unfortunately I was unable to save the 
trace, but I'll try to reproduce it).
Greets,
