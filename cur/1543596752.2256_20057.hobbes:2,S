No. But you can move the sym/ncr driver bundle from 2.2.18-pre1 to 2.2.17
and vice-versa.
 sym53c8xx.h, sym53c8xx_defs.h, sym53c8xx.c,
 sym53c8xx_comm.h, ncr53c8xx.h, ncr53c8xx.c
You also can download either sym-1.7.3c-ncr-3.4.3b, or sym-2.1.11, or just
both and play with all that stuff under 2.2.17 and later 2.2 kernels.

Btw, I am interested in results using sym-1.7.3c and sym-2.1.11 under
kernel 2.2.17 and possibly 2.2.18.

Unfortunately, I haven't any tape device.

Thanks for your testings,
