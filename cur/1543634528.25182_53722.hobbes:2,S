I think you're right. Embedding types into naming makes for easy examples
of using "find /devices -name ..." to look cool, but it also likely makes
for rather cumbersome names, _and_ there are tons of devices that want to
expose multiple different capabilitites ("it's not just a floor wax, it's
a dessert topping too!").

You're bound to have multiple files under each node anyway, for things
like partition information etc. Yes.

Absolutely. The current driverfs thing does some of that (the "name"
thing, mainly useful for havign uniform naming between different tools,
and PCI devices for example all get a standard set of property files
from the bus driver).
But it should hopefully be driven by real need, not just "cool feature".
Which is always a chicken-and-egg issue, of course.
