Okay :-) So it looks like two of you says we have been mistaken :-D (and 
the behaviour has been changed since linux-2.4)
Anyway - How does this work in practice? Does the file system 
implementation use a wrapper for kfree or?
Is there any way to force instant free of kernel memory - when freed? 
Else it is quite hard testing for possible memory leaks in our Umbrella 
kernel module ... :-/
