kvm will forward a virtual machine's writes to port 0x80 to the real 
port.  The reason is that the write is much faster than exiting and 
emulating it; the difference is measurable when compiling kernels.
Now if the cause is simply writing to port 0x80, then we must stop doing 
that.  But if the reason is the back-to-back writes, when we can keep 
it, since the other writes will be trapped by kvm and emulated.  Do you 
which is the case?
