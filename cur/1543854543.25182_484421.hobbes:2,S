I would very much *hate* that happening on any x86 box of mine.  I won't
presume I understand enough of the usage pattern on weird devices, and it
would make some sense to power off the display if you are removing the
*only* way to talk to the video device (but I still think this is naively
assuming the local admin don't want to just leave the display as-is).
But as you said yourself, in regular desktop/laptops (at least x86 ones)
textmode is there, and works just fine, so killing the display on module
removal is wrong IMO.
