I just tried blanking a CD-RW with the latest -git tree. The machine just became
unresponsive and then froze. When it became unresponsive the clock in GNOME still
displayed the current time but I could not focus any windows anymore. Then I had
to hard reboot the machine. The logs say nothing. I repeat: nothing.
Does anyone have similar problems?
