Well, this was a great idea until you find that this is also used for
linking the intermediate vmlinux objects for kallsyms, and kallsyms
uses weak (== undefined) symbols:
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
.tmp_vmlinux1: error: undefined symbol(s) found:
         w kallsyms_addresses
         w kallsyms_markers
         w kallsyms_names
         w kallsyms_num_syms
         w kallsyms_token_index
         w kallsyms_token_table
Maybe kallsyms needs to provide an empty object with these symbols
defined for the first linker pass, instead of using weak symbols?
