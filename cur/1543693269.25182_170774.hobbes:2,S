Just checked. You right about chp_release which should do
a kfree on the struct channel_path object. But the two
other release functions are really dummy functions because
cu3088_root_dev and iucv_root are static structures.
I'll ask Conny about the her chsc.c code.

P.S. whats wrong with the struct assignments ?
