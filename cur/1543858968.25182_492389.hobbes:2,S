Hmm. One possible explanation: maybe the page actually _did_ get unmapped 
from the page tables, but got added back?
I don't think we lock the page when faulting it in (we want it to be 
uptodate, but not necessarily locked). So assuming the pageout sequence 
always _does_ follow the rule that it only does try_to_free_buffers() on 
pages that aren't mapped, what actually protects them from not becoming 
mapped (and dirtied) during that sequence?
So we should probably do a "wait_for_page()" in do_no_page()?
Or maybe only do it for write accesses (since we don't really care about 
getting mapped readably)? If so, we need to do it in the write case of 
do_no_page() _and_ in the do_wp_page() case. Hmm?
