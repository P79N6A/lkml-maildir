I have to agree that for .23 we can't do much more than this. And tasks
moving to the right without actually doing work and advancing
fair_clock do scare me a little.
Also, while I agree with Linus' definition of sched_yield, I'm afraid
it will cause 'regressions' for all the interactivity people out there.
Somehow this yield thing has made it into all sorts of unfortunate
places like video drivers, so a heavy penalizing yield will hurt them.
