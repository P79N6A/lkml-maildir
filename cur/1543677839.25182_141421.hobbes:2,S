This is the sort of thing that bothers me.  Block devices deserve their 
own "view", so we have /sys/block/ -- perhaps to be renamed 
/sys/class/block/.  Fine.
But what other sorts of things deserve their own "view" as well?  Some
are already established, maybe others aren't.  How's a developer supposed
to know whether the driver he's working on deserves its own entry in
/sys/class/ or not?  How's a user supposed to know where in the hierarchy
to look for a particular device?
Here's a suggestion for something that would definitely help.  Create a
listing (maybe in Documentation/driver-model/) of all the major kernel
subsystems that deserve to have their own entries in /sys/class/ (or the
equivalent).  Explain clearly that any device driver that registers with
one of those subsystems will receive a directory in the /sys/class/
hierarchy where it can register its class devices, and say what the name
of that directory will be.  Explain that a driver that doesn't register
with one of these subsystems will simply have to create its own entry in
/sys/devices/ under its parent node.
Not all this infrastructure has been created yet.  For instance, there 
isn't at the moment any place under /sys/class/usb/ for a USB host 
controller driver to register its class device.  But if these ideas were 
formalized and written down, it would be straightforward to fill in the 
missing pieces.
