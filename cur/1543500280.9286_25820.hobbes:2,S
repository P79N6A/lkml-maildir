I thought it would be nice if you could actually take a cpu offline like a
sun sparc can.  I have a dual supersparc 50mhz running linux.  Be nice to
beable to offline a cpu, upgrade it and put it back online w/o loosing your
uptime =)  AFAIK, solaris can do this (offlining a cpu), I don't know about
hot plugging a cpu.  A friend of mine said it was doable.
