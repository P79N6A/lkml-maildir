This discussion raises an issue that I've been meaning to bring up for a bit.
Currently, the DMA-API is defined as returning a cpu physical address [1],
but should the API be redefined as returning an address which is valid on 
the bus which the device sits on? For example, on most xscale systems I 
deal with, there's not a 1:1 mapping from physical to PCI memory space,
so the address which is valid on the bus is not a valid CPU physical
address.  Imagine an SOC system with on-chip Ethernets and such that
that have direct access to the physical bus, plus non-1:1 PCI translation. 
In such a case, I would need a physical address for the on-chip devices and 
a PCI bus address for the PCI devices.  We can extend this case to a SOC 
which has on-chip peripherals on some custom FooBus with non-1:1 translation 
into physical memory. Now, depending on whether my device is on
the PCI bus or on said FooBus, my dma_addr needs to have a different
meaning.
One easy answer is to provide bus-specific bus_map/unmap/etc functions
such as is done with PCI, but this seems rather ugly to me as now every
custom bus needs a new set of functions which IMNHO defeats the purpose
of a Generic DMA API.  I think it would be a much cleaner solution to 
define the DMA API itself to return an address that is valid on the
the bus pointed to by dev->bus. I don't think this would require any 
implementation changes at the moment, but it would be a more flexible 
definition of the API allowing for easy addition of new bus types with DMA
capabilities. All the bus-specific magic would be hidden in the
architecture-specific implementations on platforms that require different
mappings for different buses, making the life of driver writers much
simpler. On systems in which everything is 1:1 mapped between physical,
PCI, and FooBuses, no changes would be required.

[1] From Documentation/DMA-API.txt in the 2.5 BK tree:
    dma_addr_t
    dma_map_single(struct device *dev, void *cpu_addr, size_t size,
                      enum dma_data_direction direction)
    dma_addr_t
    pci_map_single(struct device *dev, void *cpu_addr, size_t size,
                      int direction)
    Maps a piece of processor virtual memory so it can be accessed by the
    device and returns the _physical_ handle of the memory.
