Subject: possible partition corruption

I have run into an apparent anomaly while compiling/testing 2.5.59-bk.  My 
normal mode of operation is to do a daily bk pull to get the latest csets 
and do a compile/boot run.  After yesterday's I started seeing problems on 
reboot.  During the reboot I would get the OK booting the kernel followed 
by a system freeze.  After a forced reboot into a stock RedHat 8.0 2.4 
kernel I would see the system misidentify my boot partiton as an ext2 
partition and the following messages would appear:
EXT2-fs: ide0(3,8): couldn't mount because of unsupported optional feature 
(4).
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 08:08
Following this I rebooted using my rescue CD and did an fsck on the 
partition.  It reported recovering the journal, but found no other 
apparent corruption.  Upon rebooting, the fsck noted an unclean shutdown, 
but found the partition clean after checking it.  No other anomalies were 
noted.
However, the same thing happened this morning, so I did some investigating 
and found that now, whenever I compile and boot from any 2.5.59 kernel I 
get the above-described behaviour.  I've even tried downloading a stock 
tarball and using a default configuration.  I've made the configuration 
almost as simple as I could and still get the above behaviour.  
At this point, I'm looking at my description and seeing there is very 
little data I can provide that might be useful.  My stuff is backed up, 
and I can reformat and try again if necessary.  I'm including some data 
which seems relevant.  The configuration file I used is attached.  Nothing 
interesting gets logged to /var/log/messages.
If someone wants to look into this, I'll keep things as they are.  
Otherwise, I'll wipe and restart.
