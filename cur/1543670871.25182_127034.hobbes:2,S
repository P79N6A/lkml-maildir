Something gone wrong with this changes. My Sony Vaio Picturebook C1VE
hangs on boot when the firewire controller is probed by the init
scripts.
This happens exactly in the sequence:
	modprobe ohci1394
	grep something /proc/bus/ieee1394/devices
I'm not sure yet if the lockup is related to the ohci1394 initialisation
or the read in /proc possibly eariler than the driver expects.
The kernel still reacts to sysrq (umount/sync etc), however task/memory/pc
sysrq function do NOT work...
I'll investigate a bit further on this today.
Stelian.
