Okay, maybe this is a bit naive, but isn't this problem already solved? 
Couldn't we just put a read/write lock on the module, where using is
reading, and removing is writing?  As I understand it, this should
impose little overhead on the use (read) case, and ensure that, when a
context has the remove (write) lock there are no no users (readers) and
cannot be any?
