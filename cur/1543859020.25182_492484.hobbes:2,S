Well I just took a quick look, and it looks like there is a bug in amd64-agp.c
It isn't masking off the reserved high bits of the register at 0x94, and it
isn't being very careful with the promotion to 64bits.
However that does not appear to be the problem, as the base addresses you are
seeing are only seeing 40 bits long, and you are fixing it in the register
before the code in amd64-agp.c runs.
So I do agree that it appears that the BIOS is letting the upper address bits
float, and giving you a 32bit value.
Fixing this with a board specific pci quirk is questionable but it may
be ok.  A reliable fix is probably if the address is sufficiently questionable
to allocate a new aperture ourselves, and scream that the BIOS messed up.
arch/x86_64/kernel/aperture.c appears to do that when we use the agp aperture
for an iommu.
I don't think a agp aperture above 64bits is actually very interesting,
in practice as most agp cards are only 32bits so won't be able to use it.
And we are talking bus addresses here.
