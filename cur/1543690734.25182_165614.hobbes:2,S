As I understand it:
* For maximum optimisation, compile for your specific CPU.
* To get compatibility for everything except a 386 CPU, with almost
  optimum performance, compile for 486.
* To get full compatibility, with possibly significantly less than
  optimum performance, compile for 386.
* Only optimise for Pentium if the kernel is intended to be run on a
  Pentium CPU, as the resulting code is less optimal for many other
  processors than code optimised for a 486.
Recently, there have been efforts to make a universally compatible
kernel, with optimisations for all CPUs that don't significantly
adversely affect any other CPUs.  The logic behind this seems to be
that users can then use their distribution's kernel on any CPU, and
get reasonable performance.
Nothing wrong with that in principle, but there are also a lot of
users who are happy to compile one kernel for one machine, and want it
as optimised as possible.  This often includes embedded systems
developers, but certainly isn't limited to them.
