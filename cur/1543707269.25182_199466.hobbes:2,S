color index yellow black '(~b suspend | ~b swsusp)'
But if you use remote mailboxes (such as imap or pop) this sucks. So
it's better to put something like:
folder-hook . "uncolor index *"
folder-hook . "color index yellow black '(~b suspend | ~b swsusp)'"
folder-hook ^imaps?:// "uncolor index *"
folder-hook ^pops?://  "uncolor index *"
in your .muttrc to avoid downloading _all_ message bodies in the index
when reading imap(s) or pop(s) mailboxes.
