actually it was originally noticed by David Miller and mentioned by me :)
The deadlock scenario is when you:
	ptr = mmap(file, 4096, 0)
	write (file, ptr, 4096);
the write() generates a pagefault which deadlocks on the page lock. (the
process gets 'stuck'.)
the goal is to fix this completely pointless situation in a way that does
not slow down normal usage.
