Is it possible to request_nmi() the way you can request_irq() from a kernel
driver on the i386 arch?
Our hardware watchdog is dual stage and can generate NMI on first stage ,
our cPCI handle switch can also be used for Hot swap request via NMI.
I'ld like to make use of this, I noticed cpqhealth module already
implemented some nmi handling but this driver is close sourced.
Should we patch in i386/kernel/traps.c to add a callback to our stuff in
unkown_nmi_error().
I'ld like my driver to register a callback there, what about maintaining a
list of user callback functions which could be registered via:
request_nmi(int option, void (*hander)(void *dev_id, struct pt_regs *regs),
unsigned long flags, const char *dev_name, void *dev_id);
where option could take meaning such as
 - prepend   : place at start of nmi callback functions
 - append    : place at end of nmi callback functions 
 - truncate : replace callback chain
Is there any standard mecanism to implement such features( dual stage
watchdog ) ?
Comments are welcome.
