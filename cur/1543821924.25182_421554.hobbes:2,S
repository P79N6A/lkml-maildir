Subject: [PATCH] Time: optimize out some mults, since gcc can't avoid them
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/5/200

Newsflash: GCC not as smart as once hoped.
This patch removes some mults since GCC can't figure out how.
Pointed out by Roman Zippel.
