that was used to happen with the old vm, now the fariness in the
allocator is better and normally the first task that runs in the oom
condition is the one that's killed, plus after one task-killing no other
tasks are normally killed (in the past the vm wasn't capable of using
the freed ram promptly and it was killing 3/4 tasks in a row, so syslogd
was killed despite the hog already exited). still you're right syslogd
may be very well still killed in theory but that's ok with me.
