[ description of a slowdown skipped ].
Well, it looks that you have at least something to slow down.  I could
not get a single packet through my tulip on Alpha from at least
2.4.4-ac11 and up.  You can consider that an ultimate slowdown.  I tried
also a driver from 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/tulip/
 and results
are the same.  This NIC, Digital DS21143 Tulip rev 65, works just fine
with various earlier kernels, including assorted 2.4.3 variants.
It is on 10baseT netwok - which may, or may not, be relevant here.
