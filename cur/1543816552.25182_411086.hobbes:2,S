What's SPI specific?
+struct scsi_ioctl_id { /* used by SCSI_IOCTL_GET_ID ioctl() */
+    int host_no;        /* as in "scsi<n>" where 'n' is one of 0, 1, 2
etc */
+    int channel;
+    int scsi_id;        /* scsi id of target device */
+    int lun;
+    int scsi_type;      /* TYPE_... defined in scsi/scsi.h */
+    short h_cmd_per_lun;/* host (adapter) maximum commands per lun */
+    short d_queue_depth;/* device (or adapter) maximum queue length */
+    int unused[2];      /* unused part should be zero */
+}; /* 32 bytes long on i386 */
Everything has to support HCIL, even if it's through some kind of
mapping.  Yes, I know it might not make much *sense* for some
transports, but we do need to support it.  Type isn't SPI-specific.
cmd_per_lun isn't SPI-specific either, and neither is d_queue_depth,
although neither may make too much sense for some adapters or targets.
