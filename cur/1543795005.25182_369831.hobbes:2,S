If the serial driver detects a port at a particular address, the
hardware or something which behaves very much like a serial port
is there.
However, as far as I recall, you've never reported this as a problem.
Care to put something in bugzilla or start a new thread?  Starting
with the entire kernel messages with the DEBUG_AUTOCONF stuff enabled
in the 8250 driver would probably be good.
