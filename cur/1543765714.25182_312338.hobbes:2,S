Definitively. Mountpoints use kernel space, the users could DoS the machine.
The per-Machine-limit isn't fine-grained enough, since the users may DoS
each other.
You'll have to avoid users capturing system daemons in D state or in
slowed-down artificial directory-forests, too. I think namespaces will
do most the trick.

Users being able to mount random fs containing suid or device nodes
are root whenever they want to. If you want to mount with dev or suid,
use sudo and restrict the mount to a limited set of images/devices/whatever.
