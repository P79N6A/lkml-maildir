That's an enormous limit. Consider the fact that you will have a multiplicity
of such hash tables, each potentially eating 1/16th of your total memory
(remember, the bootmem allocator's only real limit is how big a chunk of
memory it can allocate in one go).
Do you have numbers to show that committing an eighth of your memory (8GB if
you have 64GB - two hash tables at 4GB apiece) to hash tables is almost
certainly not worth it.
For instance, the dcache:
	(*) Assuming 64GB of memory, of which 1/16th allocated to the dcache
	    hash table and 1/16th allocated to the inode hash table.
	(*) dcache hash buckets are 16 bytes apiece on PPC64.
	(*) 4GB hash table gives you 256 Meg hash buckets.
		(gdb) p ((4ULL<<30)/16) / 1024 / 1024
		$1 = 256
	(*) The dentry struct on PPC64 is approx 256 bytes in size.
	(*) The remaining 56GB could provide 224 Meg dentries if allocated to
	    nothing else.
		(gdb) p (56ULL<<30) / 256 / 1024 / 1024
		$2 = 224
	(*) So you'd end up with more buckets in the hash table than you could
	    possibly allocate dentry structures.
