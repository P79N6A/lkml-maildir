On large production environments, you always lose a certain percentage of
machines at each reboot. Most often, it's the CR2032 lithium battery which
is dead and which causes all or parts of the CMOS settings to vanish, hanging
the system at boot. Then you play with the ON/OFF switch and a small
percentage of the power supplies refuse to restart and some disks refuse
to spin up.
Fortunately this does not happen with all machines, but if you have such
problems with 1% of your machines, you lose 10 machines when you reboot
1000 of them. Those problems require a lot of man power, which explains
why such systems are rarely updated.
Causing that much trouble just to enable debugging is clearly
unacceptable, and your debug kernel will simply never be used. Not to
mention the fact that people will never trust it because it's almost
never used !
