s/computationally/& and IO/. If we are thinking about the same algorithm -
good luck doing that if your data structures are on disk. Think of
reference locality in that animal. Try to estimate the amount of IO and
fun with seeks. It's nice when you have your data in-core, but when it's
on-disk and you want reasonable locality of references for normal uses...
