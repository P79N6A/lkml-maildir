I haven't found that to be significant in profiling overhead, mainly
because the hash table removes some of the "sting" of high sampling
rates (and the interrupt handler dwarfs all other aspects). The
situation is probably different for more general tracing purposes, but
I'm dubious as to the utility of a general tracing mechanism.
(besides, a profile buffer needs a sample context value too, for things
like CPU number and perfctr event number).

But as I point out in my other post, dentry-offset alone is not as
useful as it could be...
I just don't see a really good reason to introduce insidious tracing
throughout. Both tracing and profiling are ugly ugly things to be doing
by their very nature, and I'd much prefer to keep such intrusions to a
bare minimum.
The entry.S examine-the-registers approach is simple enough, but it's
not much more tasteful than sys_call_table hackery IMHO
