my problem with Robert's patch is that the intention is not debugging, the
intention of the change was make it the standard thing. This just hides
serious bugs like the one in slab.c. I'd suggest to rather fix these bugs
and be aware of them via a debugging mechanism, instead of putting one
more (not quite cheap) check into one of our hotpaths.

yep - i've moved the check from schedule() to preempt_schedule(), which
clearly is the most serious offender. This enabled the removal of the
CONFIG_DEBUG_IRQ_SCHEDULE define.
