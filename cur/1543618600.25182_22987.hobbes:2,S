Yes, this line is added by the -pre7 patch.
The reason I haven't upgraded -rmap to -pre7 yet is that
I used to pull the new kernel patches from Ted T'so's
2.4 bitkeeper tree, but he hasn't updated his tree yet.
I think I'll have to re-do his changes to bk's import
script so I can import incremental kernel patches with
the changelog messages in the bk tree ...
regards,
Rik
