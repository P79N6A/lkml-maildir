Oh, ok.
Sure, makes sense, and is probably the right thing to do - that way you
can (if you really want to) do some strange half-way vfork(), half-way
clone() thing where you share your file descriptors in a vfork(). 
I don't know how useful it would be, but it would be no uglier than doing
it any other way, and I see some advantages (no need for a separate
vfork()  system call - clone() can do it directly). 
I thus remove all my objections,
