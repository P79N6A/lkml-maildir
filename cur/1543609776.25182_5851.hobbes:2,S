Can you do some statistics for me:
   cat /proc/meminfo
   cat /proc/slabinfo
   vmstat 1
while the worst swapping is going on..

That's normal and usually good. It's supposed to swap stuff out if it
really isn't needed, and that improves performance. Cache _is_ more
important than swap if the cache is active.
HOWEVER, there's probably something in your system that triggers this too
easily. Heavy NFS usage will do that, for example - as mentioned in
another thread on linux-kernel, the VM doesn't really understand
writebacks and asynchronous reads from filesystems that don't use buffers,
and so sometimes the heuristics get confused simply because NFS activity
can _look_ like page mapping to the VM.
Your MP3-over-NFS doesn't sound bad, though. 3MB of swap is perfectly
normal: that tends to be just the idle deamons etc which really _should_
go to swapspace.
The cdrecord thing is something else, though. I'd love to see the
statistics from that. Although it can, of course, just be another SCSI
allocation strangeness.
