Hello Alan,
Many thanks for the reply..
cat /proc/mtrr shows things, but not sure what it SHOULD be...(output
below)
Running 2.5.66 now seems to have speeded up things considerably,
however, I still consider this slow for a 2.4Ghz machine (we have some
2Ghz under alot of load that will still compile things quicker..)
So any suggestions and of course the help you have already provided
are appreciated.
Craig
