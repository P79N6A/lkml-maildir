So will I, but this message says it better than one of my rants would.
So I'll just second it and add:
Get used to it David, you are NOT going to change it with anything

Cheers, Gene
People having trouble with vz bouncing email to me should add the word
'online' between the 'verizon', and the dot which bypasses vz's
stupid bounce rules.  I do use spamassassin too. :-)
