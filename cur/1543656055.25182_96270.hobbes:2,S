Rubbish.
Think about what you've just said.  Patch level version changes are
things like 2.5.43 to 2.5.44 or 2.4.19 to 2.4.20.
You are saying that we shouldn't change any interfaces between (eg)
2.5.43 and 2.5.44, but we should change every interface we want to
change between 2.4.15 and 2.5.0.
This is obviously completely bogus.  2.5 is a _development_ tree.
Everyone should expect anything, including interfaces to change
between each development patch level.

If interfaces are changed without extremely good reason between two
_stable_ patch level versions, that would be a bug.

Was the problem against a stable kernel version?  Did you report the
problem when you found it?  Was there a response?
Unless you have done at least the above, I, for one, have very little
sympathy.
