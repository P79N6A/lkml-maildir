interesting thing that i'm getting the same problem (freezing at
'Calibrating delay loop....')
on PC164 motherboard with 21164-500Mhz CPU, but this problem doe snot appear
on XL300 DEC system (it has 21164-300Mhz CPU and different type of
motherboard)
I was getting this problem on kernels 2.2.10, 2.2.12, 2.3.29 and 2.3.31. i
did not check any other
versions.
only command 'halt' and reset button after halting gives me properly reboot,
but it's impossible to reboot remotely this way.
