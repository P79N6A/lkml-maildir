This assumes that we have a better bus than "platform" to dump drivers like
thinkpad-acpi, hdaps, and a host of other host-specific stuff.

Yes, and there is a LOT of non-PNP stuff involved, since platform became the
dumping ground for host-specific devices (as opposed to platform-specific
devices).
