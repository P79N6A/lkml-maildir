Works just fine with the Apple UniNorth controller in my powerbook in cursory 
testing. Tested with multiple sbp2 hard disks, plugging and unplugging, 
mounting and unmounting, etc.

Forgot to check that it survived bus resets. Will try to double-check that 
tonight. I don't have any other ppc systems w/firewire controllers handy at 
the moment to try other controllers, but can probably manage to get one set 
up soon...
