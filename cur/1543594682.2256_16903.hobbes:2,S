Quoting Tom Diehl <tdiehl@pil.net> from ml.linux.kernel:
:What is the best way to install the modules? Is there a directory _all_ of
:the modules exist in b4 you do "make modules_install". I usually end up
:setting EXTRAVERSION to something unique and doing a make modules_install.
:That way it does not hose up the modules for the build machine.
:Is there a better way?
Yes, there is.  I usually add the the following to the main Makefile:
export INSTALL_PATH=/nfs/lyon/home/ram/root-install/boot
export INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/nfs/lyon/home/ram/root-install
I then proceed as usual, and the modules get copied over NFS to
the target machine, in root-install/lib/modules, etc...
If you don't have NFS mounts to the remote machine, you'll have to
rcp the tree, that's all.
