../Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt says:
ERR is incremented in the case of errors in the IO-APIC bus (the bus 
that connects the CPUs in a SMP system. This means that an error has 
been detected, the IO-APIC automatically retry the transmission, so it 
should not be a big problem, but you should read the SMP-FAQ.
Christian, knowing nothing more than this too :-)
