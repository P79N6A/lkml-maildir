No disagreement, but that's not the point.
SND_PCM_OSS gives an OSS API interface for userspace on top of ALSA.
ALSA drivers shouldn't care whether they are controlled directly 
through ALSA or through a legacy OSS API on top of ALSA.
If someone wants to use SND_PCM_OSS that is fine, but the ALSA interface 
to my saa7134 card is working fine, so why does it force me to compile a 
legacy OSS API interface into the kernel?
