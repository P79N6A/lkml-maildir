The limit is architecture dependant, for ia32/i386 is it 32.
    Making it a per-architecture value or even a config option make a
    lot more sense.
It turns out I was full of it, you can buy off the shelf 32-processor
systems.
In anyone from Compaq is reading this, you should send me a 32-way
Xeon ASAP just to prove they really work :)
