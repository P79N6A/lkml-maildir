I strongly suspect that the vast majority[1] of hardware that "needs" 
the trip points changing works perfectly well under Windows, so it's 
likely to be papering over bugs in the kernel. It'd be nice if we fixed 
those rather than encouraging people to poke stuff into /proc, 
especially when doing so is guaranteed to break in really confusing ways 
with a lot of hardware. The firmware can reset the trip points at 
essentially arbitrary times and is well within its rights to expect the 
OS to actually pay attention to them.
[1] Some hardware is simply broken. We don't carry phc just because some 
vendors put the wrong voltage values in their tables, either
