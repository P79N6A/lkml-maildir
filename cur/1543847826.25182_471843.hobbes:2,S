If they are simple users, they don't have to "learn" seq_file semantics,
they would just replace their sprintf's with seq_printfs (as my changes
in OCFS2 show).
IMO, seq_file interface is not that complex to learn either.

"char *" can also be used to spew out large amount of data (ok, maybe up
to PAGESIZE in configfs's case :). My point is that changing char * to
seq_file doesn't necessarily "introduce" the issue (of spewing large
amounts of data).

This issue is moot, unless you have intentions of changing the user
interface of configfs to be anything other than a file system, isn't
it ?

Now we are in need of *large* reads. We can add this feature and let it
evolve to the next level later when somebody needs to *set* a large
attribute.
Also, these changes do not result in any change in the user level
interface. So, we can afford this interface changes to change again
later.
