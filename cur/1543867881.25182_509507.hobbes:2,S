What are you talking about?  This is not about software patents AT ALL.
Not one person is claiming they have a patent on whatever it is that
V J's company is putting out (especially since we have no idea what
that might be).  Patents != copyright.
Software patents: This super cool red button idea is mine.  If you make
a red button, you have to give me money.
Copyright: This code is mine.  You can't copy my code without my permission.
GPL: You can copy my code all you want, BUT if you add on to it and give out
the results, you have to give out your code too!
Your argument might have some sort of merit, but I gave up trying to work
through it.  Stop confusing patents and copyright and try again.
