Forcing the user to provide the geometry. Historically that driver dealt
with the main disks the user had. Today its only use is specialist
recovery work. Anyone recovering a disk has to get the geometry data into
the BIOS (if the BIOS even allows it - many now don't) and will therefore
know it for hd= arguments as well
