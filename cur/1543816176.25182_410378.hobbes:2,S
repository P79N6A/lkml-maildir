Updates to kdb v4.4-2.6.16-{common,i386,ia64}-1, moving to -2.  Mainly
to get more forceful with stuck cpus on IA64, where the "non-maskable"
interrupt is masked by local_irq_disable().
We finally get decent backtraces on stuck IA64 cpus.  It took a long
time to get there, KDB could not change until the base kernel could
cope with INIT and recover correctly.

	* Add some more xpc flags.  Dean Nelson, SGI.
	* Replace open coded counter references with atomic_read().
	* Pass early_uart_console to early_uart_setup().  Francois
	  Wellenreiter, Bull.
	* Replace open code with for_each_online_cpu().
	* If cpus do not come into kdb after a few seconds then let
	  architectures send a more forceful interrupt.
	* Close a timing race with KDB_ENTER_SLAVE.
	* kdb v4.4-2.6.16-common-2.
2006-03-24 Keith Owens  <kaos@sgi.com>
	* Define a dummy kdba_wait_for_cpus().
	* kdb v4.4-2.6.16-i386-2.
2006-03-24 Keith Owens  <kaos@sgi.com>
	* Use INIT to interrupt cpus that do not respond to a normal kdb IPI.
	* Remove KDBA_MCA_TRACE from arch/ia64/kernel/mca.c.
	* kdb v4.4-2.6.16-ia64-2.
