As an aside, there are some further hardware limitations in the
timekeeping core that limit the amount of time the hardware can sleep.
For instance, the acpi_pm clocksource wraps every 2.5 seconds or so,
so we have to wake up periodically to sample it to avoid wrapping
issues.
Just to be able to deal with all the different hardware out there, the
timekeeping core expects to wake up twice a second to do this
sampling. It may be possible to push this out if you are using other
clocksources (HPET/TSC), but if sleeps for longer then a second are a
needed feature, we probably will need some infrastructure in the
timekeeping core that can be queried to make sure its safe.
