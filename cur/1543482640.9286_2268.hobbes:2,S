hi again,
i wrote another message about my problems compiling kernel. despite all my
problems making the zImage(vmlinuz) file i thing i have the prepared
vmlinux file. my question is: how to compress vmlinux by hand (the
automatic way - make zImage doesn't work) - i.e. to make it vmlinuz(zImage)?
thanks in advance for your help!
