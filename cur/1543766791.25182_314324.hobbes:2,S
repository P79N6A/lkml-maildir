Which portion of the userspace library? HCA-dependent code, or common code?
The HCA-dependent code would fail to count when the same memory was
registered to different HCAs (for example to the internal network device and
the external network device).
The vendor-independent code *could* do it, but only by maintaining a 
complete list of all registrations that had been issued but not cancelled.
That data would be redundant with data kept at the verb layer, and by
the kernel.
It *would' work, but maintaining highly redundant data at multiple layers
is something that I generally try to avoid.
