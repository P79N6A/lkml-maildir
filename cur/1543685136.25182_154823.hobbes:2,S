OK, I can reproduce this on 4way.
Binary searching (insert gratuitous rant about benchmarks that take more
than two minutes to complete) reveals that the slowdown is due to
sched-2.6.0-test2-mm2-A3.
So mm4 with everthing up to but not including sched-2.6.0-test2-mm2-A3:
	Max Jobs per Minute 1467.06
	Max Jobs per Minute 1478.82
	Max Jobs per Minute 1473.36
	3853.55s user 264.31s system 370% cpu 18:31.95 total
After adding sched-2.6.0-test2-mm2-A3:
        Max Jobs per Minute 1375.63
        Max Jobs per Minute 1278.40
        Max Jobs per Minute 1293.11
        4416.70s user 275.61s system 374% cpu 20:53.58 total
A 10% regression there, mainly user time.
The test is:
- build bk://developer.osdl.org/osdl-aim-7
- cd src
- time ./reaim -s4 -q -t -i4 -f./workfile.new_dbase -r3 -b -l./reaim.config
