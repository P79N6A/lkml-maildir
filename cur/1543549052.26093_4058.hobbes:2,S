   The SCSI stuff is pretty straightforward, and it works for me (and
   I also built a kernel with all regular x86-capable SCSI drivers
   included, so the others got at least that level of testing). But
   there are some non-x86 scsi drivers out there etc, so give it a
   whirl.
Did you try to boot these kernels containing scsi devices you
don't have?  I don't see how it could work (actually I do, see
below).
Look at drivers/scsi/scsi.c:scsi_unregister_host, near the
end we have code like this:
	if (tpnt->present)
		return;
	...
	remove_proc_entry(tpnt->proc_name, proc_scsi);
Compare this to the code in scsi_register_host which explicitly
does not create the procfs nodes if tpnt->present == 0.
Is this another case of ix86 not trapping NULL pointer derefernces
during bootup?  I got it on Sparc in strlen of tpnt->proc_name
as a result of this remove_proc_entry() call.  Is there some way
to make ix86 start trapping on NULL pointers earlier in the boot
sequence so these kinds of bugs don't live very long?
Anyways, the code at the end of scsi_unregister_host should rather
be something like:
	if (tpnt->present) {
		remove_proc_entry(tpnt->proc_name, proc_scsi);
		return;
	}
	...
