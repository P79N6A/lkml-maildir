Yes, that's my fear, we may get inconsistent behaviors across architectures.
I think the only way to ensure some consistency would be to use the
enter/exit_idle callbacks you mentioned assuming those would be available for
all architectures.  With this, we could guarantee that we are not monitoring
usless execution (including low-power mode) simply because we would explicitely
stop monitoring on enter_idle() and restart monitoring on exit_idle().

So the goal of this is for a more realiable way of measuring short
sections of code, isn't it? If I recall, the TSC does not quite work
with frequency scaling.
Is anybody lobbying the HW designers to implement another register to
do what you need here? That would certainly simplify things.

Certainly given that there are other users of that resource and
that on K8 you only have 4.
