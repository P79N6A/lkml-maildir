that would be a change from, well... a LONG time
The question is what "load" means; if you want to change that... then
there are even better metrics possible. Like
"number of processes wanting to run + number of busy spindles + number
of busy nics + number of VM zones that are below the problem
watermark" (where "busy" means "queue full")
or 50 million other definitions. If we're going to change the meaning,
we might as well give it a "real" meaning. 
(And even then it is NOT a good measure for determining if the machine
can perform more work, the graph I put in a previous mail is very real,
and in practice it seems the saturation line is easily 4x or 5x of the
"linear" point)
