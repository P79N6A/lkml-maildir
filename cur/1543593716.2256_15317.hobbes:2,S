The AMD760 which looks like it might walk on both the alpha, an x86
side of the fence also has an iommu.  Mostly it's used for AGP but
according to the docs it should be able to handle the other cases as
well.  The only downside is that it only supports 4GB of ram...
Anyway we shouldn't assume iommu's don't exist on x86.
