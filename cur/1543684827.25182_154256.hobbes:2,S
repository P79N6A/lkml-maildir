Well, that leads only to the point that ".." implementation is just lousy and
it should have been done right in the first place. If there is a need for a
loop or a hardlink (like "..") all you have to have is a standard way to find
out, be it flags or the like, whatever. But taking the filename or anything not
applicable to other cases as matching factor was obviously short-sighted.
