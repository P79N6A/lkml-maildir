The lockd module has already registered the name /proc/sys/fs/nfs, so
your scheme will end up corrupting the sysctl list. Sorting out the
/proc namespace issue is the main reason why this hasn't been done
before.
Personally, I'd prefer renaming the lockd module into
/proc/sys/fs/lockd, but it will have to be up to Andrew to decide
whether he wants to allow that during a stable kernel cycle.
Also note that putting initializers into a ".h" file is horrible style.
".h" files should be for forward declarations only.
Cheers,
  Trond
