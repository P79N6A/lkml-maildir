Just send 'em to linux-kernel first-up and cc everyone else.  That way you
avoid duplication of effort and everyone is on the same page.
I'm still struggling to understand the rationale behind the mem.c change
btw.  io_remap_page_range() _is_ remap_page_range() (or, now,
remap_pfn_range()) on x86.  So whatever the patch is supposed to be doing,
it's a no-op.
