When you are on the phone with an irrate customer at 2:00 am in the 
morning, and just turning off your broken 4K stack fix
and getting the customer running matters. 4K stacks are a BAD idea. I 
have even found USER SPACE apps
that crash linux without the 8K option. Andrew has spoken. Suck it up 
and deal with it. It's not a problem limited to Windows
drivers.
