To all those who are interested, here are the results of the benchmarks
I've been running over the last week between all the major file systems
(and there different mount options) using both Bonnie++ and IOzone. More
tests are currently underway, so the results will be updated as they
come in. 
Hopefully these results will give you a good comparative overview of each of the
different file systems strengths and weaknesses.
