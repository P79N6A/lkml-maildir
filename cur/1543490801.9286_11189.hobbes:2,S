Linux 2.0.36  RedHat 5.2
Hello,
Is someone awared about possible time problems ?
We have two systems both with the same motherboard but different
disks, lan adaptors, etc.
Each Linux box is going ~ 15 minutes back each day, whenever
the system is used (monday-friday) or sleeping (saturday and
sunday)
A third box using Linux 2.0.36 BUT on a different motherboard
has no troubles.
Some ideas about ?
Regards
