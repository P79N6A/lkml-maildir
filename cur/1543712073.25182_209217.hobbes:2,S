i believe the fix we want is to pre-balance the context at fork() time. 
I've implemented this (which is basically just a reuse of
sched_balance_exec() in fork.c, and the related namespace cleanups), 
could you give it a go:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/scheduler-patches/sched-2.6.5-rc2-mm2-A5
another solution would be to add SD_BALANCE_FORK.
also, the best place to do fork() blancing is not at
wake_up_forked_process() time, but prior doing the MM copy. This patch
does it there. At wakeup time we've already copied all the pagetables
and created tons of dirty cachelines.
