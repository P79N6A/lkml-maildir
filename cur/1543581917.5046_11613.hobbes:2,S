There is another much more effective solution in the works.  The C
standard allows bounds checking of arrays.  So it is quite possible
for the compiler itself to check this in a combination of run-time and
compile-time checks.   I haven't followed up but not too long ago
there was an effort to add this as an option to gcc.  If you really
want this fixed that is the direction to go.  Then buffer overflow
exploits become virtually impossible.
