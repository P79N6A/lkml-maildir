Unfortunately, this is the one case where constant inode numbers really
do matter.  Almost any program that encodes the inode number in the datafile
will do something like:
	f=creat(...);			// f is now zero-length
	fstat(f,&st);			// get the inode number
	sprintf(buf,"%d\n",st.st_ino);
	write(f,buf,strlen(buf));	// oops... inode number just changed..
No, I don't have a solution for this problem.
