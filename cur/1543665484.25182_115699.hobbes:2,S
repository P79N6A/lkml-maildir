	Wait, so ugly hacks that steal every remaining major is doing it
'right'?  I've done the math with the current available majors.  I don't
see 4000 disks there, and that is just life as it exists today, not 2-3
years from now when 2.8 finally appears.  Like Andrew asked, please
describe exactly how you'd support it.
