Sorry to say I sometimes see this on 2.4 kernels as well, even on PPP
dialed connections. The symptoms are that the local ssh client just stops
sending packets. That's very easy to tell with an external modem:-) The
connection is still fine, if I have multiple connections to the host only
one hangs, and I believe it's a client issue in ssh.
What I see may or may not be related to your problem.
