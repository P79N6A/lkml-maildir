Again, not speaking for Christoph, but *I* do consider the regression
to be important and I do want it to be fixed. I have asked for a test
case to reproduce the regression and/or oprofile reports but have yet
to receive them. I did fix one regression I saw with the fio benchmark
but unfortunately it wasn't the same regression the Intel guys are
hitting. I suppose we're in limbo now because the people who are
affected by the regression can simply turn on CONFIG_SLAB.
In any case, I do agree that the inability to replace SLAB with SLUB
is a failure on the latter. I'm just not totally convinced that it's
because the SLUB code is unfixable ;).
