One moment, I haven't read the mail not totaly. My network card has IRQ
10 and the 'spurious 8259A interrupt' is about IRQ 7. Why should the IRQ
change ? And with the 2.4.9 kernel I have also 
NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
eth0: Tx timed out, cable problem? TSR=0x16, ISR=0x0, t=24.
...
but none 'spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7.'
I don't think these 2 messages aren't related to eachother, isn't it a
coincidence that they are comming after eachother ?
