I missed the original message, I'm running a dual athlon 1800+ XP system
(actually both CPU for some reason get identified as MPs, but they are
retail XP chips).
I assume you are using a tyan tiger or thunder motherboard (as I dont
know of any others in retail yet).  Is your ram registered ecc ram?  If
it's not, that most likely is your problem.
Is your ram from tyan's approved list?  Mine isn't (crucial, but I have
never had bad luck with them, even though others seem to have had some
problems), but I would see if it would change if you would get ram from
suppliers tyan reccomends.
On the issue of future motherboards not supporting XPs at all, I've read
in multiple places that the rumor to that effect was false, and that the
motherboards will not lock out XPs, they just won't be supported (much
like motherboard manufacturers don't support overclocking, but many give
you the means to do it).  If you have information direct from the
manufacturers, than I have no reason to not believe you.
