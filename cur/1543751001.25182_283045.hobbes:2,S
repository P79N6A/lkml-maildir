It's only a problem when you care about the state of things that have
run before the module is loaded.  This ranges between no problem and
major problem on a case by case basis.  For example, really makes sense
to have SELinux only compiled in.  For this one, we can just track
capabilities bits in default dummy stub code, it's painless and allows
keeping capabilities modular for those who use it that way.
