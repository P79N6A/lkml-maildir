I'm currently working on Robert D. Russell's "Fast Kernel Tracing", see
his homepage 
http://www.cs.unh.edu/~rdr/
 for the paper & distribution.
This is for kernel 2.4.0-test9, though.
The most recent version I'm working on is for 2.4.21, should support
on-the-fly log flushing and work on smp (not much tested though, it
began to work yesterday :) ). It might be ported to 2.5 without too
much work.
Hoping this might meet your needs,
Samuel Thibault
