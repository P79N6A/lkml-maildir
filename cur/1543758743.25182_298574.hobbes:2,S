Hmm. Well, I notice that e100/e1000 has a heartbeat built into it, so
that if the card doesn't respond, it resets the card.  So this would 
be a natural place for them.  And I suspect that *all* scsi drivers
have timeouts; they initiate a cascade of reset sequences if they
don't get data back after X seconds.
I see nothing wrong with adding a requirement, something that says
"If a device driver wants to be pci-error aware, then yea-verily it 
must use a dma-timeout timer (say 15 seconds) and check for 
pci errors in the dma-timeout handler".

I don't know what the pci-express implementation is like, but the 
ppc64 implementation is *not* transactional, so I don't have that issue.
If some pci chipsets only report dma errors on a transactional basis,
then we need to modify pci_map_sg() and pci_map_single() and etc. to
take a cookie as well.  It would be up to the device driver to alloc
and retire cookies as the dma's complete (and make sure it can find
its cookies in any context).  Is this or something like this that 
is needed?
