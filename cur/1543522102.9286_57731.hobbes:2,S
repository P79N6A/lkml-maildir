   please apply this against 2.3.40-pre3, thanks.
And you choose new numbers for the uid32 system calls, and fixed up
the system call tables on Sparc for us as well, right?
If you want to break the sparc build to fix a problem
you have, go through the maintainers, such as myself,
ok?
Thank you.
Later,
