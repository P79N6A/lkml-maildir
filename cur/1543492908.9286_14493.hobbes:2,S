Anyone know of a *good* vender selling
rack mount Xeons (1 or 2 processors) w/256M for < 5k?
Wanna benchmark this against alternatives
for a linux based web/app server bank...note
the app (linked from the htpp server) hits memory
hard, so it would be interesting to see if the $$
for the cache are worth it. Thoughts?
Thanks in advance.
Russ
