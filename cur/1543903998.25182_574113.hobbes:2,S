I believe a central place where user can set/change hw state to save
power or to increase computational power is definitely a goal to pursue.
But i truly think that the OHM approach is the best one ie using plugins
so that one can make a plugin specific for each device. The point is that
i believe there is no way to do an abstract interface for this and trying to
do so will endup doing ugly code and any interface would fail to encompass
all possible tweak that might exist for all devices.
For instance on graphics card you could do the following (maybe more):
-change GPU clock
-change memory clock
-disable part of engine
-disable unit
i truly don't think you can make a common interface for all this, more
over there might be constraint on how you can change things (GPU &
memory clock might need to follow a given ratio). So you definitely
need knowledge in the user space program to handle this.
best,
