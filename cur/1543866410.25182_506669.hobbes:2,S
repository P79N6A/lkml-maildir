It was CCed to David Miller and you and netdev a long time ago (like 8-9
months ago.)  It's been in the -mm tree since then and discussed on lkml
a few times too.
As I got David's ack for it, and he said to push it through my tree, I
didn't think any more of it.
My apologies, I should have consulted you again before doing it.
thanks,
