your queue does not apply cleanly here:
 Applying patch patches/paravirt-add-a-sched_clock-paravirt_op
 patching file arch/i386/kernel/sched-clock.c
 Hunk #5 FAILED at 148.
 1 out of 5 hunks FAILED -- rejects in file arch/i386/kernel/sched-clock.c
could you please just send me your current sched-clock.c? (that's what 
i'm interested in) I'll deal with the on_cpu_single() dependency. 
Thanks,
	Ingo
