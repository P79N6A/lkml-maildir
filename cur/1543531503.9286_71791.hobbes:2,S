"Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 03:06"
hda1 = boot
hda5 = swap
hda6 = root
I installed GCC 2.95.x and Xcdroast yesterday on a recently installed RH
6.1 system.  Those are the only changes since I last rebooted the box. 
I used the new compiler installation to build a 2.2.14 kernel so I know
that worked OK.  I had also burned a couple CDs I know that installation
worked too.  I kept the original LILO config intact, installing a new
section for the 2.2.14 so that I could back out if there was a kernel
problem.  Now when trying to boot from _either_ LILO option I end up in
the same place so I really don't believe this has anything to do with
trying to install a new kernel.
From an existing system, I believe I found that 03:06 is /dev/hda6
(which is where I expected to find
the root partition - brw-rw----   1 root     disk       3,   6 May  5 
1998 hda6).  Any ideas as to
what may have caused this and what to do to get out of it?  (The kernel
isn't the only thing that is
panicing!)  I am guessing that I have a HDD problem, or maybe a
partition problem - but I don't know where to start looking for the
problem.
Thanks for your help,  Phil
