For 2.6,  the framebuffer console can activate as early or as late as one
wants because fbcon will wait until a framebuffer driver becomes active. In
contrast, in 2.4, at least one fb driver needs to be active for the
framebuffer console to become active.

Yes, that is the downside to a userspace solution. How bad will that be?
Note that Jon Smirl is proposing a temporary console driver for early
boot messages until the primary console driver activates.
