I have a friend who constantly uses it, and his code is unreadable, because
sometimes, a "0 == xxx" becomes "0 <= xxx" or "0 >= xxx" which is difficult
to understand. Thinking that xxx is negative because it's written on the
right side of a >= is complicated. And the worst he does is when he uses
functions : 
   if (0 < strcmp(a, "xxx")) ...
   if (sizeof(t) > read(fd, t, sizeof(t)) ...
I have already helped him track bugs in his programs, and some of them were
just related to this usage, because nobody's brain can understand these
constructions immediately without thinking a bit. So I'm all against this
sort of thing.
Cheers,
Willy
