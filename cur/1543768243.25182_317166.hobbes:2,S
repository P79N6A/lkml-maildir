The thing that interests me most is the difference (if any) between 
giving a stream of bytes an opaque name e.g. "Chapter 1 of my book.sxw" 
versus giving a stream of bytes a query expression that can also be 
considered an opaque name e.g.
"/book/chapter[1] "
This is what the Russell/Frege descriptive theory of proper names 
applied to storage systems in a sense[1].
I've written about this stuff before on ITWorld (warning: chatty prose 
style ahead):
