Ah, I see now what you mean. The setxattr syscall only accepts
well-formed acls (that is, sorted plus a few other restrictions), and
user-space is expected to take care of that. In turn, getxattr returns
only well-formed acls. We could lift that guarantee specifically for
nfs, but I don't think it would be a good idea. Entry order in POSIX
acls doesn't convey a meaning by the way, and the nfs client never
rejects what the server sends.

The server must have sorted lists. Linux clients send well-formed acls
except when they fake up a mask entry; they insert the mask entry at the
end instead of in the right position (this is the three-entry acl
problem I described in [patch 0/13]). We could insert the mask in the
right position, but the protocol doesn't require it. We must sort on the
server anyway, and the server can as easily swap the two entries.

That would cause getxattr to return an "invalid" result. libacl doesn't
care, but other users might exist that rely on the current format. In
addition, comparing acls becomes non-trivial: currently xattr values are
equal iff acls are equal.
