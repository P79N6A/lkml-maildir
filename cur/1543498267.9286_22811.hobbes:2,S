Actually, gpm is probably going to be trashed and replaced with kernel
approach (because in-kernel input drivers mean better sharing
etc.). XF86_SVGA already has its fbcon counterparts (like
creatorfb).

Podfuk needs coda to work, so leave coda in. And yes, do that -- I
want someone testing podfuk ;-). [But... It would have horrible
performance consequences for cases like accessing huge files on VFAT.]
