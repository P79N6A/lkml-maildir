I think you need to use the smp_call_funtion service and define the
function to be a spin_until_notified function. Each other processor will
call spin_until_notified when it receives the IPI for smp_call_function.
You can do what you need, then change some global that's keeping all the
other processors strapped to spin_until_notified.
