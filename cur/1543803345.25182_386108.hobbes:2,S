no, that's why I reverted the full thing.

What should I expect? I didn't notice anything in particular and
actually the box stays alive for just a few minutes, then reiserfs
explodes so I have no chance to notice anything in the long run.

yes, during the short time it stays alive there's no difference between
my watch and my laptop.

yes, same as above

didn't try as there seems to be no problem in timekeeping
