Still, there should be something before these suppressed messages started.

No, they don't.
It goes like this:
bit0 = 1 means the workaround may be omitted when operating at 10 Mbit
bit1 = 1 means the workaround may be omitted when operating at 100 Mbit
So the workaround needs to be activated when at least one bit is zero, and 
may be omitted when both bits are 1. That's exactly what the original code 
does.

Today, I put my hat on before leaving home, and no brick fell on my head 
anymore. So the hat must have helped!"
Please read the code if you don't believe me.
