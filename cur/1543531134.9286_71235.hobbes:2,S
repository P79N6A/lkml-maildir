   No, of course it doesn't. Why should it? The whole point of it was to
prove that Linux always overcommits memory. It did that. The point was not
to prove that you can trivially nuke any Linux system without even being
nasty. We know that already. I didn't see any point in causing greef (lost
work, etc.) for the other users on that box. Do you?

   It would have helped because only 3-4 of those processed would have been
allowed to run, thereby isolating the problem to the remaining 10-11
processes.

   The problem _is_ overcommit. The proof that overcommit is the problem is
that the kernel's OOM killer sets in.

   None. We don't have any processes doing anything wrong. We're just so
unfortunate that we're running a kernel which doesn't have even the most
basic piece of memory management.
