- dscc4 (patch in Jeff's -netdev)
  Apart the fact that the driver crashes on module insertion and is
  unusable, users do not complain so this is a minor annoyance from
  a maintainer's pov :o)
- r8169 (patches available on netdev, sent to Jeff and Andrew)
  rtl8169_open() after rtl8169_close() sucks.
