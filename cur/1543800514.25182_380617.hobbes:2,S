My point goes more into the following direction:
- 10,000 inline's are in .c files
- 12,000 inline's are in .h files
The interesting one's are the latter:
- if they are too big, the smallest solution is to move them to .c files
- it might cause a size _increase_ if some version if gcc will not 
  inline all of them
The latter gives warnings with -Winline, and adding this flag to the 
gloval CFLAGS and analyzing all the warnings (especially with -Os) could 
make my point void.

#1 should definitely be done.
And you do slightly manage to convince me that #2 is a good (additional) 
approach (if -Winline gets added to the global CFLAGS).
