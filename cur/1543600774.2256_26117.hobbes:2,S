I am not a VM hacker -- can you tell me where to start? what do you
suspect it is?
If the user stops seeing the error with preemption disabled, is your
theory nulled, or does that just mean the problem is agitated by
preemption?
I don't think Arjan was using ReiserFS, so its from grow_buffers...
I appreciate your help.
