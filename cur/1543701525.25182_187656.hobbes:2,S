I have two promise cards and four Maxtor
DiamondMax Plus9 60G with 8MB cache each
hdparm -d1 -u1 -m16 -c1 -W1 -A1 -k1 -X70 -a 8192
and my raid0 is software, linux, not the promise chip's raid
on each drive I see 900 MB/s 47.2 MB/s
and on /dev/md/2 /tmp with four drives
four partitions I see 900 MB/s 94 MB/s
that's with 64k raid chunk, reiser 4096b blocks
Linux says 2048k raid chunk would minimize
seek time for better real world performance. It
doesn't work better with hdparm -tT but that's not
realworld. My version of reiserfs doesn't allow
changing the block size.
