Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi all,
This is a patch based on the Ingo's idea/patch to track 
delay_tsc() migration to another cpu by comparing 
smp_processor_id(). It is against kernel-2.6.24-rc3.
What is different:
1. Using unsigned (instead of long) to unify for i386/x86_64.
2. Minimal preempt_disable/enable() critical sections
   (more room for preemption)
3. some statements have been rearranged, to account for
    possible under/overflow of left/TSC
Tested on both: 32/64 bit SMP PREEMPT kernel-2.6.24-rc3
Hope it is correct. Comments, please.
