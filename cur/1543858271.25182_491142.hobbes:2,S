Init script changing shouldn't be necessary; we have module blacklist stuff.
For example, on an ubuntu system, we have:
/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
psmouse-foo causing problems?  Just add it in there, and you're good.
I'm not aware of any way to specify values to be set in /sys (similar to
/etc/sysctl.conf), but I'm sure we'll get something sooner or later.

Alright, I guess we're down to a matter of taste then.  I'll change the
patch to still have a monolithic psmouse that allows protocols to be
enabled/disabled via Kconfig.
