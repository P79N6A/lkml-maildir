Anton,
I had used the 2.6.12 kernel with the latest Inotify. There was no
"I_WILL_FREE" in the any place. And, there was no problem in compilation.
I believe Inotify is very useful and should be included in the next versions
of the kernel. Are there any ongoing plans for this?
Thanks,

Note I seem to remember you are using 2.6.12?  If so I am not sure when
the I_WILL_FREE stuff came into existence, so should inotify.c not
compile after applying this patch just delete the " | I_WILL_FREE " in
the two places it occurs introduced by the patch and all should be fine.
Best regards,
        Anton
