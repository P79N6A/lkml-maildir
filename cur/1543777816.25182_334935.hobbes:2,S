I think, that if there is a loop, the pci_get_device always decrease it, see
pci_get_subsys, line 249 (2.6.13-rc3-git4). This function is called by
pci_get_device.
So the question is, if I really need to decrease count, if it occurs in
while (pdev = pci_get_device(..., pdev))
{
initialize(pdev);
// pci_dev_put(pdev); // uncomment or no?
}
Now one problem came on my mind with initialize(pdev) -- if there is
some global var my = pdev in that and it returns back and calls
pci_get_device, it counts down the reference count of pdev, but we need
it anywhere else. Shouldn't be there pci_dev_get to increase ref count and
decrease it either after it is unused or after module unloads or never in
other cases?

I don't know, if you think it global, or if am I here with other fellows 
(no, I'm not).
I don't know what kind of comment you have on your mind. Could you, please,
specify it more.
I only changed names of called functions and added some pci_dev_put, 
what should
I comment?

The only thing, that pci_dev_put do, is that it releases memory of pdev 
structure, if
reference count is 0 (as far as I can see, there is no real doc, which 
could ensure me,
it is my piece of knowledge found out from source code, maybe wrong??). 
It does not
do anything with the device.
So, the question is the same as above... Is it right to NOT release, 
when it's in a loop?
