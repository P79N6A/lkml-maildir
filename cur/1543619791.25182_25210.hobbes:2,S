I'm having a lot of trouble debugging this one.  Prinks are not being
displayed on the screen, though I know they are being executed.  I have
even tried William Lee Irwin's early_printk patch to try and get printks
to display.  Apparently the prink buffer is not being flushed this early
in the kernel code?
The only debugging technique I have found is to insert return statements
in order to avoid different sections of code.  I find, for example,
that if I make the first statement of the smpboot.c:do_boot_cpu a return,
the kernel will boot (without SMP on, of course).
Obviously, this is not the best technique.  I have been able to narrow
the location of the bug down a little with it, but I feel I will be able
to discover little more with this technique.
I'm not sure what else to do without printks.
I would appreciate any tips on debugging smpboot.c.
Thank you.
