correct me if i am wrong here but i know alot of students
who use linux todo serious stuff and get really pissed off have to
reboot into windows to play games because they dont work
under windows and for various other things that also cause
problems in linux. Actually quite alot of them end up
dumping linux because any of the serious games wont work on there
system because they would have to tear much of it apart toget
them to work.
this isnt a serious problem then ?
