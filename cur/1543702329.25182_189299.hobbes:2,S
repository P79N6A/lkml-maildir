It's more important that we write code that will fit in our limited
human brains than that we write code that will avoid spurious warnings
from gcc ('spurious' meaning warnings for code that gcc will correctly
compile anyway).
Or, see a couple months ago, in a thread with the Subject of:
  [PATCH] irda: fix type of struct irda_ias_set.attribute.irda_attrib_string.len
in which Linus wrote:
