Oh, i fear this patch makes some issues (e.g. changing NOZOMI_MAX_PORTS
without adapting all its usages).. as this one (together with [RFC 7/13])
is quite big and i really don't wanna loose the multicard support (which
i also cannot test yet here at home), 
i'd defer those two until next week when i get a chance to test and have
more time.
Thanks,
Frank
