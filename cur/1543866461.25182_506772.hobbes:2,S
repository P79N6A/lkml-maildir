Where?  It requires that someone hold mmap_sem for writing as well as a
page lock (in an order which would require some thought).  Do we ever do
that?

mutter.
Could perhaps fix that by running ClearPageUptodate in invalidate, thus
forcing the pagefault code to take the page lock (which we already hold).
That does mean that we'll fleetingly have a non-uptodate page in pagetables
which is a bit nasty.
Or, probably better, we could add a new page flag (heh) telling nopage that
it needs to lock the page even if it's uptodate.

So the rule is that ->nopage handlers against pagecache mustn't lock the
page if it's already uptodate.  That's OK.  But it might conflict with the
above invalidate proposal.
Gad.  ocfs2_nopage() diddles with signals.

We'll never, ever, ever update and test all filesytems.  What you're
calling "legacy" code will be there for all time.
I haven't had time to look at the perform_write stuff yet.

This is write().  We just cannot go and double-copy all the memory or take
mmap_sem and do a full pagetable walk in there.  It just means that we
haven't found a suitable solution yet.
