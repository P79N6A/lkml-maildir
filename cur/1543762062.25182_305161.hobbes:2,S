Hmmh what will we do once there will be a dual-PS3 (*) chip?
(*) Currently pure imagination, but what I mean is a two-or-more-CPU machine
with each CPU having 8 CPUs, basically. The latter fact (8 CPUs on one cpu 
chip) is reality as far as my eye was sidetracked on a Playstation3 article
about their new CPU.
