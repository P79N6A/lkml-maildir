I'm not sure if this is a Linux capabilities problem, a PAM problem, or
what, but I've noticed that If I add a user to > 32 groups...that user
cannot access anything in a directory owned by a group > the 32nd group.
Has anyone else experienced this?
Here is a sample script to help troubleshoot if you're interested:
#!/bin/bash
x=34;
useradd testuser
while [ ! $x -lt 1 ]
  do groupadd group$x
     gpasswd -a testuser group$x
     x=$(( $x - 1 ))
done
groups
read 
printf "press any key..."
groups testuser
printf "press any key..."
read
mkdir /testdir
chown root:group1 /testdir
chmod 770 /testdir
su - testuser -c "ls /testdir"
printf "press any key..."
read
userdel -r testuser
If all has gone properly, and group1 is *not* in the first groups
listing, (not "groups testuser"), then the user will not be able to even
ls /testdir, and you'll get permission denied. 
Please advise, if you can.
TIA.
