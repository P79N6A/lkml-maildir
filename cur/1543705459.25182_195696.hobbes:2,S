Yes, I was already contemplating on that one.

Done.  And updated to 2.6.2-rc3.
Many more syscalls added.  Complete patch (87 KB) is at
  
http://developer.osdl.org/rddunlap/syscalls/2.6.2-rc3-syscalls.diff
Build allmodconfig and allyesconfig on P4.  Not booted yet.
Plan to boot Tue. Feb. 3.
Also plan to build on ia64, maybe some other $ARCH that I don't have....
More comments etc.?
I'm still searching for syscalls that I have missed.
