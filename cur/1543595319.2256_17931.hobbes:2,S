Does "ordered sequence" mean "incremental"? I think not.

Really?? Did you TYPE this in or did you copy it from somewhere??
When I was on an ANSI committee (nothing to do with software), we
made damn sure that we used the correct English.
Look at:
 "have addresses that increase in the order in which they declared."
I think this was added, in the copy you cite, by somebody who didn't
know English grammar, to support the argument..."
 "in which they were declared."

And... If this was a part of a C specification it would prevent
the inclusion of const data within a structure unless the entire
structure was of type const. And, it is well known that any
data types may be structure members so this cannot be correct.

Unnamed and within are spelled incorrectly. This is not a valid

memcpy()...
Maybe you can memcpy() structures. Maybe you and I usually get away
with it, but provisions were made to handle the problems previously
discussed, by using the assigment operator "=" to copy structures.
This way, the compiler "knows" where things are and handles duplication
accordingly. And copying a structure that contains a mix of const
and writable data is probably a bug since the copy can't support
data of type 'const'.
Pass to functions...
Since any memory object(s) including structure members are simply
data contained at addresses, of course you can pass them to functions
although doing this is probably done by mistake, rather than design.
Generally, one would pass a pointer to a structure. Which, according
to previously-cited rules, represents the address of the first structure
member.
"call?" sizeof...
Returns the allocation size of the structure. So? The compiler
can certainly add up the length of all the structure members plus
any padding and return the result. Note that you can't allocate data
of type 'const' so when copying any structure by any means, the
copy contains no 'const' data, even if the original structure contained
'const' data members. The const data is/are not missing, they are
just no longer const.
Put into arrays...
Of course. Nothing has to be physical representation as a requisite
for being put into arrays.
