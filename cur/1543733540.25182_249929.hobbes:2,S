they don't serve any special purpose.
But please doublecheck that they are really not needed.

c)
Many driver authors share their code this way between different major 
kernel versions, which makes it easier for them to maintain their code.
#ifdef's for kernel 2.4 are often still actively maitained.
#ifdef's for kernel 2.2 are only very rarely actively maitained.
#ifdef's for kernel 2.0 (as in your example) are most likely completely 
obsolete.
