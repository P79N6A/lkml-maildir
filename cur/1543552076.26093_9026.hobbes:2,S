Hi all,
I would like to transfer a huge buffer (say 128k) from user space to kernel
space and return the result in the same buffer so that the user can access
the processed data from that... since these pages passed from the user spcae
may be fragmented how do i make them contiguous from user space.. and what
functions should i use to copy data from this user space buffer to kernel...
will copy_from_user do this job.. and for retuning it should i use
copy_to_user.... 
i would like to avoid copying the same data to and fro from user space is
there any other method to do this... could someone send detailed info about
this.... samples /links will be really helpful.... any help appreciated... 
thanks
azad
