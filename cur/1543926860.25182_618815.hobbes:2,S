hehe, I was waiting for the "where's the numbers". Right now I don't have
them. Mainly because I don't have boxes with more that 4 CPUs on them. And
4 really doesn't make much of a difference.
If others out there would like to test, I'll write up a couple of versions
of this code and that way we can really get numbers for them.
Or perhaps someone would like to send me a 16way box. Although my wife
would kill me. ;-)
Hmm, I'm sure I can get to our lab and run some tests too.
