Disabled tasklets are not scheduled by enable_tasklet (). A disabled
tasklet may temporarily appear in the queue, but nevertheless
tasklet_action will remove it. It seems gross to traverse the list in
order to remove a tasklet at the first disable.

all.

Hmm, if TASKLET_STATE_SCHED is not set tasklet_kill will not deadlock.
And tasklet_kill yields (?). Doesn't that mean that tasklet_action
will be called eventually ?
