Well, please tell me now what number of people actually _will_ upgrade?
And if they don't, will they use the -rc kernels?  No, they won't, because
of the apparent wireless breakage.
This way we loose quite a few testers and the entire development
process is affected, and that's _only_ because you have decided it
will be _convenient_ to change the ABI.  However, such changes affect
_everyone_ and in a wrong way, except for a few people who actually want the
change.  They cause more damage than they are worth, so they should be avoided
at all reasonable cost.
It would be fair to introduce the change when distributions actually ship the
userland tools capable of handling it, but not _now_.
