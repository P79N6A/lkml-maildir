It's unnacceptable to _me_, since it doesn't conform to the POSIX spec.
(even if it _is_ a withdrawn draft.)  I also still do not like the fact
that your using both the sticky bit and the uid to mark the file, and
Linux already has a use for these.  This also is unnacceptable to _me_.
My current favorite solution is Ted Tso's idea of adding a new bit to ext2
attributes and using _that_ to mark a file with capabilities.  I also
suggest a compatibility option settable under /proc to 'map' this bit over
the sticky bit during, say, package installation.

I would _not_ design a system based on capabilities with uid(admin)=0; I'd
probably just use 1, or maybe 10 or something.  With a real implementation
of capabilities, I can make admin whatever uid I want, and there's only
disadvantages to having admin own every file on the fs.  Better, the admin
account should probably own _no_ files, since ruid passes to files
exec'ed.
