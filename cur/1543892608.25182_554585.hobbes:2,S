It should be fairly simple for 32/64-bit compat code too.
The compat code should just call the compat system call

No no no. That would be horribly idiotic.
The thing should be 99% generic code, ie we would have
	syscall_indirect(..)
	{
		long retval;
		.. set up signals/flags ..
		retval = arch_syscall_indirect(syscall, args);
		.. unsetup signals/flags ..
		return retval;
	}
	compat_syscall_indirect(..)
	{
		int retval;
		.. set up signals/flags ..
		retval = compat_arch_syscall_indirect(syscall, args);
		.. unsetup signals/flags ..
		return retval;
	}
and the *only* thing that each architecture would need to do is that 
(trivial) arch_syscall_indirect() thing (and the compat version, if 
applicable). And those literally should be generally pretty damn trivial.
The only _subtle_ issue is any system call that actually uses "pt_regs". 
So we'd have to disallow exec/fork/vfork/clone/. They take magic pt_regs 
pointers etc. On x86, for example, the following system calls should *not* 
be things you can do this with:
	asmlinkage int sys_fork(struct pt_regs regs)
	asmlinkage int sys_clone(struct pt_regs regs)
	asmlinkage int sys_vfork(struct pt_regs regs)
	asmlinkage int sys_execve(struct pt_regs regs)
	asmlinkage int sys_vm86old(struct pt_regs regs)
	asmlinkage int sys_vm86(struct pt_regs regs)
	asmlinkage long sys_iopl(unsigned long unused)
because those either take pt_regs, or make pt_regs out of their arguments 
(that "unused" is used to do:
	volatile struct pt_regs * regs = (struct pt_regs *) &unused;
so there is *some* care needed, but other than taking care of this, the 
implementation on x86 should really be totally trivial.
