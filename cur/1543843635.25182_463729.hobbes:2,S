I resent that. If your efforts in working on popular kernel topics
met rapid reward then I'm happy for you. The fact that others tackle
unpopular topics and persist despite constant personal attacks should
nevertheless be recognized for what it is.

You're entirely correct. I never claimed it to be perfect, that's why I
had approached others early on to try to bridge things together and
that's why I used to post ltt patches to the lkml.

If that's how it was read, then it wasn't written right. ltt was never
really a profit center for me, embedded Linux training was -- you
wouldn't believe how much more profitable training is than pure
consulting. But my own business is just beside the point. My point
was that the high barrier to entry for tracing fragmented efforts
around it. As for corporate decisions which culminated from such
resistance, they probably were the sanest decision to take at the
time. Heck if I was a manager at any of those companies I would have
likely taken the same decision. It was, and still is, though,
counterproductive. Fully justifiable, but counterproductive.
