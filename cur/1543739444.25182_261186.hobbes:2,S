A reproducible, hard hang on x86-64, during bootup's fsck ("touch 
/forcefsck").  Athlon64, VIA motherboard, Promise SATA, VIA SATA, 512MB, 
r8169.  Hang begins in 2.6.9-rc3-bk4, everything works in 2.6.9-rc3-bk3. 
  Hang persists in 2.6.9-rc4 and 2.6.9-final.
Symptoms:  touch /forcefsck and reboot.  fsck will successfully check 
all partitions of the WD drive attached to Promise, then fail precisely 
54% through the fsck on the Maxtor drive attached to VIA SATA.  SysRq 
will print out the command header, but no output, for sysrq-[tps]. 
sysrq-m works...  for a little while.  then the machine completely 
hangs, no sysrq or anything.
This is 100% reproducible.
There are -no- SATA driver changes between -bk3 and -bk4 AFAICS, which 
leads me to guess at VM, or x86-64 platform?
The diff between -bk3 and -bk4 is pretty small, if you ignore the ARM 
and m32r arch changes.
