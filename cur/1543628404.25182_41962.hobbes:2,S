AFAIK, the standards clearly specify behaviour wrt. open file descriptors
and clone-on-exec file descriptors across execve().  However, there
is nothing specified when it comes to closed file descpriptors across
execve(), notably FD's 0, 1 and 2 are certainly not required to be open
across an execve() of a SUID/SGID applictaion.  One could argue that
SUID/SGID apps that trust the file descriptors they inherit across exec()
are buggy.
Having said that, there are a number of implementations of this type
of protection for the linux kernel stemming from the Openwall project.
If you are interested, see:
