Hmm.  If that happens, I'm out of ideas for now.  Cannot do more than
give a warning.

Those cases I should already catch.  If foo is of type "struct bar",
"bar.callback" will be the function name for a pseudo-function.  That
function is called by iterate_over_blah and calls f.  Unnamed struct
get a name made up from the components of the struct, like
____FAKE.Name.Chip.stat.Regi.LILP.Opti.high.lowe->ProcessIMQEntry.
Doesn't look pretty, but works.
