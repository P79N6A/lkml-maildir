Well, for a reasonable range of timesource frequencies and interval
lengths, the cycle values needs to be 64 bits wide and the mult/shift
operation to convert cycles to time is going to need to done with 64
bits.
Since xtime is currently a timespec, we already keep nanosecond
precision using 64 bits. It was then just a question of how complicated
is it to do the manipulations with timespecs vs flat 64 bits worth of
nanoseconds.  Nanoseconds made the design cleaner, so I went with them
keeping the option to optimize in the future when real issues arose.

Well, even if it is less of a concern with lower HZ values, my code
should still reduce the interrupt overhead for those who would like to
have higher HZ values to improve latency. (Although until I have
numbers, its all just talk. :)

Well, I think the only overhead to be worried with is just in
gettimeofday(), but let me get some hard numbers to show that. I've
already implemented some optimized caching for x86-64's vsyscall-gtod
implementation, so let me also try to make an arch generic version and
see if I cannot settle your concerns.

Thanks, I really appreciate your review and feedback. I very much want
this to be a solution everyone can be happy (or at least indifferent)
with.
