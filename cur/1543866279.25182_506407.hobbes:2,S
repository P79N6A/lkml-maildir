memory-less-node problem is a bit big issue for this small bug.
For removing memory-less-node, we'll have to make consensus on 
"a node represents a group of memory, not cpu, not devices"
I read old e-mails on node-hotplug again.
In the early stage of node-hotplug, I assumes "a node has memory".
After discussion between several groups, I knew there are people
who consider groups of something as node.
(and we had to change our plan......)
like this (old) homepage's FAQ 5.
