Thats fine with me - I understand that. I just thought that there has been 
no outcome at all.
I will try to be patient as long as I do not dig into kernel hacking 
myself deeply enough to be able to help with that - did not do more than 
to put together two conflicting patches to compile my own kernels till 
now and forward port a patch for a sundance network card.  I can help 
with testing once there is something testable tough.
