The mount hangs again. This time without a symbolic link.
umount -f /dev/hdb6 gives:
umount2: Device or resource busy
umount: /dev/hdb6: not mounted
umount: /home/hal/download/kde3/cvs: Illegal seek
Prozesses that use that partition:
# lsof | grep kde3/cvs
cc1plus   31258      hal  cwd    DIR       3,70       33    133147
/home/hal/download/kde3/cvs/kdelibs/kstyles/keramik
cc1plus   31258      hal  mem    REG       3,70    85595    248079
/home/hal/download/kde3/cvs/kdelibs/kstyles/keramik/keramik.cpp
cc1plus   31258      hal  mem    REG       3,70    23725    135815
/home/hal/download/kde3/cvs/kdelibs/config.h
rm        31413      hal  cwd    DIR       3,70       33    133147
/home/hal/download/kde3/cvs/kdelibs/kstyles/keramik
I can't kill them, nothing in the logs again.
