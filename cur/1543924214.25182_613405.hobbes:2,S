That was the initial problem, and I already answered to Ingo about
it - pid, obtained in one pid namespace shouldn't be used in another.
This is not a design bug, but a design idea. If he managed to get two
threads in different namespaces, then we should fix this ability (but 
I thought that I handled it - the copy_pid_ns call doesn't allow to 
create a new thread in a new namespace:
        new_ns = ERR_PTR(-EINVAL);
        if (flags & CLONE_THREAD)
                goto out_put;
) I should have first asked Ingo about how he managed to get two 
threads in different namespaces to fix this, but Ulrich said that 
 "everything else I have seen simply doesn't work without
  breaking something"
so I asked him to elaborate on this - what _else_ doesn't work.
Thanks,
Pavel
