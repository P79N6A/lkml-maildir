    * Some reports of unknown cause of ext2 corruption since 2.5.3 (not
related to the missing i_fsize clearing from .3pre3-5)
It would be good to report the last version that this problem was reported
against, and this type of problem can't really be tested on each pre patch.
That's basically what I was asking for before...
==============
# IDE floppy oops on some (zip100) setups. (Triggers BUG_ON() in
elevator.c:237)
If the version is reported for this then you can see what function was being
reported at the time.  Otherwise some other patch could shift the contents
to make line 237 point to another function (rewrites and such...)
