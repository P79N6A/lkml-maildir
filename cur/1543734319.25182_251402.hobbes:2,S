Instantiation via normal fault-in becomes lock-intensive once you have
enough CPUs.  At low CPU count the page zeroing probably preponderates.

pagetable teardown (munmap, mremap, exit) is the place where pagevecs help
->lru_lock.  And truncate.

Possibly.  I wouldn't bother converting anything unless a profiler tells
you to though.

It's pretty simple to diddle PAGEVEC_SIZE, run a few benchmarks.  If that
makes no difference then the discussion is moot.  If it makes a significant
difference then more investigation is warranted.
