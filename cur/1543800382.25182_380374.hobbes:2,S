What are you talking about?
You sent two different patches:
1. uninline
2. unit-at-a-time for i386
These are two separate patches that should be discussed separately.
Your answer regarding your second patch does't fit in any way my email 
regarding your first patch.
Your uninline patch shouldn't cause any regressions regarding stack 
footprint, and stack usage is not what I was talking about.
My email was about things like Andi's example of the x86-64 vsyscall 
code where we really need inlining, and due to your proposed inline 
semantics change there might be breakages if an __always_inline is 
forgotten at a place where it was required.
Your uninline patch might be simple, but the safe way would be Arjan's 
approach to start removing all the buggy inline's from .c files.
