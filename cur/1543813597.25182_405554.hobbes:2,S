Probably not much as I have to let tasks with a soft cap of zero get 
some CPU to avoid problems with them holding resource other tasks may 
need and 0.01% is probably as low as I can keep it anyway.
Just to clarify.  At the moment, what I do to a task with a zero soft 
cap is give them a priority one above MAX_PRIO (i.e. 2 higher than any 
other task can have) and make sure they always go on the expired array 
at the end of their time slice.  They also get a load weight of zero to 
prevent them getting a CPU to themselves.  This means that any task that 
becomes runnable on their CPU should preempt them and if they're the 
only task on their CPU it will look idle and waking tasks may be moved 
there if the other CPUs are idle.  This may be enough to stop them 
interfering with your game's tasks.
I'm currently letting them have a time slice determined by their nice in 
an attempt to reduce context switching but this may change as it 
probably allows them to get CPU access when there are non background 
tasks on the expired array.  I'm still thinking about how to prevent 
this and keep context switching low.
Tasks with non zero soft caps go through a different process and (as far 
as possible) tasks without soft caps avoid the capping code.
