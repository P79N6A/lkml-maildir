Actually, as far as I can see, he has re-invented having a real-mode 
code chunk which then gets run before the protected-mode kernel.  We 
already have that!  You can even intercept between running real-mode and 
protected-mode if you really want to.
I don't really see anything new here.  The one thing that he does which 
we might want to consider emulating is writing the real-mode code in C. 
  Right now, the assembly code is very cluttered, and with the size 
limit having been, long ago, raised from 2K to 32K we should be able to 
fit a fair bit of code even if we use C.
