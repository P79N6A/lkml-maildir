There's a lot of directions you can go to when doing Linux Kernel
development. 
One interesting way to go would be implementing a general Open Firmware
interface for the Linux Kernel. The needed code is there already, as
Sparc and some PPC machines use Open Firmware per default. New Open
Firmware implementations for other platforms, such as i386, x86-64,
alpha, arm and such could really use a generalized interface in the
Linux Kernel as this would make the process of implementing the Client
(Operating System) Interface of such a firmware much easier.
Open BIOS is that approach of writing a free and portable Open Firmware
implementation. 
Find more information on OpenBIOS at 
http://www.freiburg.linux.de/OpenBIOS/
or generic documents on Open Firmware at 
http://www.freiburg.linux.de/OpenBIOS/docs/
Any questions are of course welcome.
Best regards,
