Hi
In the 2.2.x series, there was a problem/quirk/whatever, with sg.c and sg.h
which meant that cdrecord didn't work with my yamaha4416/sym53c8xx scsi
combination. I found that the author of cdrecord (jorg schilling) wrote a
patched
version of them which worked with cdrecord and also didn't break any other
programs.
(It also meant I could dd from the drive without problems).
Basically I was wondering what work had been done on sg.c and sg.h in the
2.3 series,
and whether those changes incorporated Jorg's ideas. One of the things
preventing me
from getting my hands dirty with the 2.3 series is this specific potential
problem.
Many thanks
Daniel
