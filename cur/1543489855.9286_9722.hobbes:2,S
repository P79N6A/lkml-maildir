What pissed me off was not so much that it used it's own glibc but
because it would not let me use mine.
What they should've done is had the setup program say
glibc 2.0.7 could not be found on your system. It is recommended that you
use glibc 2.0.7 with Star Office. This version of glibc has been provided
with this release of Star Office. Please read X for details of how to
install and exit the setup now. If you wish to have Star Office use
the curreently installed version of glibc then simply continue.
Would you like to exit and install glibc 2.0.7 or continue regardless? (x/c)
Simple. I would've chosen continue and if it worked, cool. If not, well
then... 'damn' and be pissed off about that. then I either choose to live
with it (and think dark thougts at Star) or try and get their glibc installed
for star offices use without breaking the rest of the system.
It's my computer. It should be my choice.
