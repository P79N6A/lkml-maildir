 > Just change defaults in conservative governor to make it more responsive.

Alexey,
I played with conservative governor trying to make it work decently on
my p4 with no results.
As you know it works but it isn't responsive, it takes eons to step up/down.
No matter how I tune sampling_rate & C. conservative governor is useless for me.
Please look at the code, you will see ondemand is better exept for the
"give-me-all-the-power-here-and-now" thing.
ciao,
Paolo
