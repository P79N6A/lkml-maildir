Agreed, but I don't mind adding a separate counter.  However...

I'm working on a patch to do just that.  It fails when building XFS:
fs/xfs/xfs_inode_item.c: In function `xfs_inode_item_pushbuf':
fs/xfs/xfs_inode_item.c:803: error: structure has no member named `count'
fs/xfs/xfs_inode_item.c:825: error: structure has no member named `count'
fs/xfs/linux-2.6/sema.h:
#define valusema(sp)                    (atomic_read(&(sp)->count))
It seems getting the value of a semaphore is more common than it appears
at first glance.  I don't see how this code could possibly work on
parisc.  Therefore I propose:
1. Adding sem_getcount() everywhere, as in my original patch.
2. Renaming count to count_$ARCH as willy suggested.
3. Anyone who abuses semaphores will now break.  Fix them to use
   sem_getcount().
I'll work on that over the weekend unless anyone has any better ideas.
