     I've got a strange problem, a system running 2.2.13 on a Sparc LX, with
approximately 450 virtual hosts on it.
     If the number of virtual hosts is much greater than this; daemons die at
random, especially nfsd, but also mountd, portmapper, inetd, and Apache itself.
     This is running Apache 1.3.3p3.  It only seems to happen if the number of
virtual domains exceeds about 450.  The numbe of file descriptors per process
is set to 2048 for Apache, and it's only using about 1125, set inodes to 65536,
after running a day it gets up to about 36000, I do have Andreas inode fix
installed, which I had hoped might help but no difference.
     The programs just core dump.  I assume I must be exhausting some resource
but it isn't apparent to me what that resource is.  Any tips on how to isolate
and resolve this problem?
