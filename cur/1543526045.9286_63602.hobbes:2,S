Hello

So now I have compared these three alternatives (with X set to all sizes
used yesterday):
A) knfsd at Linux, mount options at Solaris "vers=2,wsize=X,rsize=X"
B) unfsd at Linux, mount options at Solaris "vers=2,wsize=X,rsize=X"
C) unfsd at Linux, mount options at Solaris
"vers=2,wsize=X,rsize=X,proto=udp"
Alternative A and C give the same results like knfsd yesterday, and B
gives the same like unfsd yesterday. This means that knfsd and unfsd
have the same performance, when UDP is used. But because unfsd is able
to use TCP it has the better performance (around 4 times) in my case.
