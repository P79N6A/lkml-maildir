No, look closer above, its name is the single-character '\xa0'. It's
this output format which makes the analysis difficult. And it's also
'od' which has added '\0' to pad its 16 bit buffer. I tend to prefer
to use 'od -tx1' or 'od -ctx1' here.
I would suggest doing 'rm -i ?' to remove that file, or rm -i $'\xa0'
for the paranoid.
