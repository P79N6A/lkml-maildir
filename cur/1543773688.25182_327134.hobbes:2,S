Note that the slab mechanism can do allocations locally
on each CPU in an SMP system, while your pointer would
need some cross-CPU synchronisation.  Also, you could
end up using the bprm from a CPU on a remote NUMA node,
instead of a local piece of memory.
Still, it would be interesting/educational to know if your
optimisation makes a difference on single CPU systems.
