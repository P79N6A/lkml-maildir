I am aware some databases support checksumming (Berkeley DB also does,
since v4.1 (*), and probably a lot more so they know where log recovery
starts) but does that make statements sensible that claim the timing
(some stochastic factor) would usually give "guarantees" about
atomicity of the individual page write when the hardware doesn't
guarantee anything beyond 512 bytes at a time? I think it does not.
I don't mind to beat up anyone, I'd just like to have the guarantees
documented without thin-ice kind of promises "usually you'll get more".
It's good to get more than what was asked for, but the application
designer cannot take that into account because he gets no guarantees. So
why bother wasting space and time for writing and reading such lines? Or
even discussing?
Maybe some interface so an application can query the maximum size of an
atomic write for any given file system (stat[v]fs extension maybe) would
be useful though, so applications can be optimized for data-journaling
file systems should these prove capable to provide "large atomic write"
guarantees.
