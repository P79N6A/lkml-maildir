I was actually part of that previous discussion.  The general consensus
was the samba 2.0.3 was *supposed* to have fixed the timeout problems. 
Many people seem to be still having problems, however.  I'm not sure
about the smbmount daemon thing.  My understanding is that smbmount *is*
the daemon.
What it boils down to, it seems to me, is that NT seems to think that
the smbmount client has disconnected.  This is probably a bug on NT's
part, but in our martyrdom we are forced to work around and accomodate
the failings of other OS's in ways they would never do for us. :/  So
what we probably need is a hard keepalive generated to the NT server
often enough to keep it from disconnecting, since the reconnect part
doesn't seem to work well.
It's also a little unclear as to whether this is a kernel problem or a
samba problem.  All the messages I get in my logs are from the kernel,
for what that's worth.
