[[ I just joined this discussion, so pardon if this is already known.]]
One advantage of ':' is that portable programs already have to avoid
it because of NTFS alternate data streams:

For example on an XP box with NTFS:
$ mkdir j
$ cd j
$ echo hi > foo:bar
$ ls -l
total 0
-rw-r--r--    1 wscott   Administ        0 Sep 10 10:45 foo
$ cat foo
$ cat foo:bar
hi
$ rm foo
$ cat foo:bar
cat: foo:bar: No such file or directory
