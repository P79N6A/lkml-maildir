I've booted to single mode without   usbcore module (thus any load of
other usb modules fails)
(removed from initramdisk as well)
This time the resume stops with these 3 lines (I'm using
no_console_suspend kernel option):
....
thinkpad_acpi  thinkpad_acpi: EARLY resume
thinkpad_hwmon  thinkpad_hwmon: EARLY resume
Enabling non-boot CPUs...
And after this it stays in deadlock -  LED for sleep is still being on
