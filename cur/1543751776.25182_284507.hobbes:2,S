Changes:
- updated to 2.6.10
- switched to using svn and now ChangeLog is back :)
- some minor changes here and there (made some headers ansi C compatible)
Two weeks after 2.6.10, but you can blame Linus for releasing 2.6.10 just 
before Christmas.
Like I've said two months ago - my scripts for testing new versions now do 
separate asm-i386-ansi and asm-i386-noansi checks, so any ansi degradation in 
linux or asm-i386 (like the one from 2.6.9) won't go unnoticed.
One more thing - llh is now officially one year old (first commits are from 
December 2003). That's a long time for any hack to live. Especially a hack 
this big and one that even has a couple of vendor specific variants. A couple 
of discussions took place concerning this matter (in the last one Linus even 
said, that he'll be accepting patches) and still I see no movement. I'd 
really like to see glibc guys figuring out a way not to duplicate definitions 
and structures from linux and starting to submit patches. That'd be a really 
good (and much needed - glibc's and linux' headers conflict in lots of ugly 
ways) first step.
Anybody?
Happy New Year.
