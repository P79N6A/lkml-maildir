If the release candidates had identical version numbers, Marcelo could
still copy rc3 to final instead of rc4. So this doesn't solve anything,
it only adds some potential for confusion.
Release candidates only help if people use them and report errors. And
people who run rc kernels want to be able to use uname to find out which
kernel version is running.
So please keep EXTRAVERSION.
