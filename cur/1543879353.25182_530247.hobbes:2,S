Which, according to the Wikipedia page on RSA, is susceptible to timing
attacks, which requires measures to counter that (that might be needed in
Tasos' implementation too though).
Doing MPI well is already tricky. Doing it in such way that most side-channel
attacks don't work is challenging, and brings already code bloat and complexity
with it.  Doing all the previous with compact and simple code is hard. Speed is
the last thing I'm worried about.
I'd rather start with good and simple code, and speed it up without adding too
much complexity gradually, case by case.
(Though I'm not the one with any interests here, so my opinion isn't worth much.)

That's nice. But then you lose more or less all advantages of using an existing
implementation, don't you? Anyway, how much different would that code be from
Tasos'?

Not if they go the other way round and strip everything except DSA functionality.
The question is, is an MPI library wanted, or do people just want RSA or DSA?

You want feature-rich and fast, I prefer dense, clean and spartan, what would
others prefer? Perhaps deciding on a common implementation is harder than it looks.
