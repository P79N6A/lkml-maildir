Yeah, that monster cfq queue depth continues to hurt in corner cases.

That's not going to help - we're way over 40% there, so the VM is getting
into some trouble.
Try reducing the dirty limits in /proc/sys/vm by a lot to confirm that it
helps.
There are various bits of slop and hysteresis and deliberate overshoot in
page-writeback.c which are there to enhance IO batching and to reduce CPU
consumption.  A few megs here and there adds up when you multiply it by
2000...
Try this:
