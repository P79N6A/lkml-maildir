Ingo,
Took me the whole of Friday night. I thought it was just me and my
vmware, so I didn't bother reporting until Jan reported it. Worried
that someone might just shoot me down for reporting a vmware problem
as it booted fine with kvm, and on X60s.
Thanks again for fixing it. Now I can test latest linux git version on
vmware again (host is running linux as well).
Jeff.
