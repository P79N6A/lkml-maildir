The variable is unsigned, so it supports values up to 255, ie no need
to change it.

That code is very old, I think Jens wrote it. I assume it wasn't just
for fun, but to be able to support drives with slightly
broken/non-standard firmware.

The current limit is 32 disc blocks, ie 64KB or 128 "linux sectors".
How do you make the packet size larger for a CDRW disc? Just changing
the constant is not going to help unless you can also format a disc
with larger packets.

Might be a good idea. On DVD discs the block size is only 32KB, so
half of the allocated memory is unused.
