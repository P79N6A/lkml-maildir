[PATCH] I2C i2c-nforce2: add support for nForce4 (patch against 2.6.11-rc4)
can you please apply the attached patch (against 2.6.11-rc4, but works
as well for 2.6.11-rc3-mm2),  that adds support for the two SMBusses of
the nForce4 to the i2c-nforce2 i2c bus driver.  The patch is reported to
work on the standard nForce4 (i.e. non-Ultra, non-SLI), but I expect
that it works as well for the other nForce4 chipsets, that seem to have
the same PCI-id for the SMBus-device.
This patch was proposed by Chuck <chunkeey@web.de>, thanks to him for the
information, testing and his patch.
