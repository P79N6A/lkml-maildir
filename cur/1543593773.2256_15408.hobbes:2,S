For the low-latency stuff, latency can be defined as
the worst-case time to schedule a userspace process in
response to an interrupt.
That metric is also appropriate in this case, (latency equals
interactivity), although here you don't need to be so fanatical
about the *worst case*.  A few scheduling blips here are less
fatal.
I have tools to measure latency (aka interactivity).  At
http://www.uow.edu.au/~andrewm/linux/schedlat.html#downloads
there is a kernel patch called `rtc-debug' which causes
the PC RTC to generate a stream of interrupts.  A user-space
task called `amlat' responds to those interrupts and
reads the RTC device.  The patched RTC driver can then
measure the elapsed time between the interrupt and the
read from userspace.  Voila: latency.
When you close the RTC device (by killing amlat), the RTC
driver will print out a histogram of the latencies.
`amlat' at present gives itself SCHED_RR policy and
runs under mlockall() - for your testing you'll need
to delete those lines.
So.  Simple apply rtc-debug, run `amlat' and kill it
when you've finished the workload.
The challenge will be to relate the latency histogram
to human-perceived interactivity.   I'm not sure of
the best way of doing that.  Perhaps monitor the 90th
percentile, and aim to keep it below 100 milliseconds.
Also, `amlat' should do a bit of disk I/O as well.
