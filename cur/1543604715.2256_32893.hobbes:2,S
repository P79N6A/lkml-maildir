It is initialized to -1 (0xffffffff) by struct definition at
linux/kernel/sched.h.  Since it is a mask, this means all CPUs
(obviously).
It isn't used much.  The softirq code uses it to try to keep some tasks
on one CPU, for performance reasons.  The Tux in-kernel httpd uses it
for performance reasons.  Some patches use it, too.
Most of the CPU affinity patches you see were written before
cpus_allowed.  They go through all sorts of trouble to do what the OS
now does on its own.  If you want to change CPU affinity then you just
need a patch that adds a syscall or proc interface for setting the
cpus_allowed mask.
I wrote a proc interface but for the life of me I can't find it.  If you
can I would be happy to update it to your kernel.  It isn't very old,
anyhow.
Andrew Morton wrote has a similar patch that is quite good.  Get it at
