this is more logically clean to me, since containers/namespaces are not 
tasks.
If someone wants to use more unix-like semantics, he can obtain fd for 
namespace and call select/poll on it :))))

see my another email about sockets.

Even if we don't take into account proprietary apps, there too many 
opensource control panels, management tools etc.
So this doesn't look good to me anyhow.

When you have a physical box there are many ways to get access to it 
without knowing passwords etc. This is the same.
