Linux Lover,
After reading a number of posts from you in the past couple of months, 
it's become rather obvious that you're taking a brute force approach to 
Linux kernel development rather than starting from the beginning and 
working your way up.  Furthermore, some of the questions you ask 
indicate that you're approaching kernel programming the same way you 
would program in user space.
Others (myself included) have suggested a couple of books to get you 
started quickly.  It will take some work on your part, however, if you 
ever want to be a proficient kernel developer.  Examples are good to 
back up theory, but are a horrible way to learn any kind of programming.
Please take us up on our advise to do some reading.  I can promiss you 
that the energy you spend on reading will be time well spent if Linux 
kernel programming is for you.  If you have questions about portions you 
read in the book, somebody here might be willing to give you a hand.
Please do not take this as an insult.  You sound like you have a lot of 
interest in Kernel development.  If that's the case, I'd like to see you 
turn into a good developer, not just another "so-so" programmer.
Good luck,
-- 
Sean
