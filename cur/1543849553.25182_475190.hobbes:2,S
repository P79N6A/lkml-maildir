The current code is fine, it never reenters ->poll, because it
maintains a "->poll_owner" which it checks in netpoll_send_skb()
before trying to call back into ->poll.
Every call to ->poll first sets ->poll_owner to the current cpu id.
netpoll_send_skb() aborts and does a drop if ->poll_owner is set to
the current smp_processor_id().
I sometimes feel like I'm the only person actually reading the sources
and past threads on this topic before replying.
