A lock-up is very generic, and could be anything.  Tons of problems are 
hidden by slowing things down, so I just feel that presuming this is 
_the_ mod15write problem may lead us down the wrong path.
Key example:  On error, we need to do a channel-reset, and possibly a 
FIFO-reset.  See the FreeBSD code.  sata_sil doesn't do this at all, and 
probably should.  The reset may cure lockups.
