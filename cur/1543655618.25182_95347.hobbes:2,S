This is more often dependant on hardware itself (NICs, chipsets). When your NIC
doesn't support scatter/gather, mitigated interrupts and other wonderful features,
and it receives 148600 pkts/second, it generates as many interrupts. Many chipsets
completely die under such a load. I can tell you that I wasn't proud of hanging my
Dual Athlon 1800+ with its 64/66 PCI slots and so from a single Celeron 800 on
100 Mbps copper !

don't even need that to kill a system. Only a cheap NIC, a responding MAC address
and that's all. Of course routing make it worse and NAT even more. And BTW, when I
get 10 to 12 kHits/s with Tux on a 100 Mbps network, you'll notice that it only
happens on empty files. This is about 1 kB per hit, from a wire point of vue.
Count the ACKs, the data (tcp headers), and global overhead, and you're not far
from wire-speed on very small packets.

don't know. perhaps forwarding packets between input and output involves queues
that are processed alternatively at HZ rate, but that seems strange to me.

E3 is only 45 Mbps (or I'm mistaken) ? Tweaking such parameters for such medium
rates doesn't seem the most appropriate to me. Perhaps his driver has some problems.
