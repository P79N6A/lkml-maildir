One possible 'work-around' is to use a journaling filesystem (like
reiserfs) which eliminates the fsck after a unclean shutdown. It's very
nice to have a crashed system back online fast. The raid sync makes the
system a bit slow, but as you said, it syncs at full speed when idle,
and is nice when less idle. :-)
