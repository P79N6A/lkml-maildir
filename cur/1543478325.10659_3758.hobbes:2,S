Sorry to have to forward this to the list, but Russell's server just
noticed that I had a open mail relay problem on my end at the end of
August, as a result I cannot send mail directly to him.

make computers run, and not to make them happy, they can, in fact, be made
happy most of the time. If users are allowed to believe that the system
administrator's job is to make them happy, they can, in fact, never be made
happy."
