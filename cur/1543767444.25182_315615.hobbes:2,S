Yes, I've been meaning to ask about this... since a SAS host adapter
(class) has ports (class?) which has phys (class), so there's this
hierarchy between those to-be transport classes.
Is this doable given the current infrastructure?
(I guess when it comes down to it one can represent a sub-class as
 an "attribute" or even as a linked list...)

Ok, we can show this from each HA (/sys/class/sas_ha/...) but you do not
want the existence of /sys/bus/sas/... where things are consolidated.
I guess that's ok, and if needed, it can always be implemented later.
