Subject: Concerning EHCI BIOS handoff timeout

Hello everyone!
My BIOS seems to be buggy when it comes to the EHCI BIOS handoff process (at 
least that's what syslog is telling me). That's why I need to wait for the 
timeout (five seconds) to happen EVERY boot. So I know in advance that 
something won't happen but still I need to wait for it - not to happen.
Of course I could just change the timeout to 0 in 
/drivers/usb/host/pci-quirks.c but then all the benefits from running my 
distribution's kernel would be gone.
I think there should be a way (maybe via a kernel boot parameter?) to tell 
the kernel that there is no need to wait.
Thanks for your input,
Sirius
