Nitpicking:
What happens if the disk decides to relocate a close to failing sector
containing mlocked data during resume zeroing? This just means that
there will be sensitive data around on the disk that can't be  zeroed
out anymore but which might be recovered by specialized
companies/institutions.
Encrypting these data in the first place reduces this problem to a
single potentially problematic sector.
If this risk is then still too high for you then there's always the
possiblity to use a sledgehammer :-)
