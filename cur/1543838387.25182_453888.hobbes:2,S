On the one hand, there shouldn't be many executables with capabilities
so even a horrendous abuse of disk space isn't so bad, but on the other
hand, yes, it'd be a horrendous abuse of disk space :)

Sounds good.
The version number will imply the bitfield length, or do we feel warm
fuzzies if the length is redundantly encoded in the structure?

One day perhaps, but that day isn't here yet.  People are still using
setuid (see /sbin/passwd), so obviously they're not sufficiently
comfortable using *only* TE/RBAC.
