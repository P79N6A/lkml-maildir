hm, you say you rely heavily on kdump ... for what exactly, and how does 
it help the upstream Linux kernel?
I see a single fix from you in the whole repository:
  ffc41cf: nbd: prevent sock_xmit from attempting to use a NULL socket
... and that single fix is a NULL pointer dereference that ought to have 
been quite debuggable from a plain oops alone.
In practice i rarely see bugfixes that were debugged via kdump. Normal 
oops based fixes outnumber kdump based fixes by a ratio of 1:100 or worse 
- and kdump is readily available these days - just nobody configures it.
For example, in the whole kernel repo there's just 45 commits that mention 
'kdump' [excluding those commits that develop kdump itself]:
  $ git log --pretty=format:"%h: %s" --no-merges -i --grep="kdump" |
        grep -viE 'kdump|kexec|dump|mem' | wc -l
  45
Contrast that to the 1954 commits that contain the string 'oops' or 
'crash':
  $ git log --pretty=format:"%h: %s" --no-merges -i -E --grep="oops|crash" |
            wc -l
  5900
That's a ratio of 1:131. (and probably optimistic in favor of kdump.)
Note, i dont have any negative feelings towards kdump - some people use it 
and enterprise folks with their frozen, immutable kernels love it - it 
just has not yet given me a reason to have particularly positive feelings 
towards it in the upstream kernel space.
