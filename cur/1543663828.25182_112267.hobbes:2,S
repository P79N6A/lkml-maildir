Well, let's back off here. It's not my claim, it's Robert Love's in that
URL. Not to arrange a fight, but I had to point that out. :)

They mention that this is related to the console code. Obviously, if you're
not checking for reschedule in a big pix map scroll blit, then it's going
to stick out boldly as a big latency spike.
A fully preemptive system would only turn off preemption in places that
would break drivers and other obvious places like scheduler run-queues,
etc...

It's also an old article, but goes over a lot of the basics of a fully
preemptable kernel like that. Things might not be as dramatic now with
2.5.62. Not sure how things are now...
