Ok so you have a sparc specific firmware loading problem. So IMHO the
right thing to do is to write a sparc specific firmware loader - either
as a module living in arch/sparc64 or assuming you never need to reload
the firmware past boot - use an initrd
For the other 99.9% of the userbase we saved 128Kbytes of ram and improved
reliability by not loading half tested firmeware on them.
