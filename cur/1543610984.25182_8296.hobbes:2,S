 This might be because I'm using current binutils (i.e. 2.11.92 from the
CVS). I believe there was a bug in older versions where relocations
against symbols from discarded sections were still resolved, to a useless
value (zero, I think).  Thus you may be lucky to get the kernel built, but
if the symbol ever gets referenced (the gets function called), bad things
will happen.
