The problem is that he's discovered something that's not supposed
to be in the code. Only 32-bit accesses are supposed to be made to
the PCI controller ports. He has discovered that somebody has made
some 8-bit accesses that will not become configuration 'transactions'
because they are not 32 bits. According to the spec, such accesses
become direct I/O to some underlying device. So, if some underlying
device shares the same I/O address space as the PCI device, that
machine is broken.
FYI, the mechanism by which ix86 hardware determines if the PCI
port access is a configuration read or configuration write is
the 32-bit access. Any other access cannot be interpreted by
the hardware as a configuration transaction. (Page 321., 
"Into to configuration Mechanisms", PCI System Architecture,
ISBN 0-201-30974-2)
It is possible that somebody had a bad board and found that writing
some junk to this port 'fixed' something. If this is so, then the
code needs some comments. Otherwise, the non-32bit accesses should
be removed.
