I've stated this for _years_ now, I'm very glad to take patches to move
the firmware blobs out of the usb drivers that currently have them, and
move it to userspace, if people send me those patches.  For all the
whining on debian-legal about them over the _years_, no one has sent me
such a patch.
Ok, yes, I did get the start of some patches in the early 2.4 series, I
said I would accept them in 2.5 as it was too radical of a change to
take during a stable kernel series (the developer agreed with me.)  They
were never resubmitted to me during the entire 2.5 development time.
thanks,
