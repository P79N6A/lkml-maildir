Here is a patch to the i386 install script, which actually makes make
install work, at least on my system; let me know how it works on yours.  For
some reason, I had to pass the arguments to installkernel separately;  the
original "$@" wouldn't work.   the diff is at
ftp://ftp.linux-speakup.org/pub/incoming/install.sh.dif
 since hotmail won't
let me send via linux, and OE keeps wordwrapping the diff whenever I paste
it in; if anyone knows how to get linux working with hotmail, please send me
privately.
Thanks,
Ameer
