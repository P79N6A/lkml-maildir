Subject: 2.4.2: What happened ? (No such file or directory)

Hi. I was using 2.4.2 without any problems until a
flood of warnings
from multilog (daemontools) appeared at my console.
What I first thought
to be a log problem seems to be serious. For some
reason applications
and daemons (not all) can't find files.
Mutt doesn't recognize ~/Mail/postponed if I try to
postpone a message:
/home/pervalidus/Mail/postponed: No such file or
directory (errno = 2)
CVS reports cvs [checkout aborted]: cannot rename file
.new.foo to foo:
No such file or directory
Trying to build an application (for example devfsd) I
get:
cc -O2 -I. -Wall    -c -o devfsd.o devfsd.c
In file included from /usr/include/signal.h:307,
                 from /usr/include/sys/wait.h:30,
                 from devfsd.c:188:
/usr/include/bits/sigcontext.h:28: asm/sigcontext.h:
No such file or directory
make: *** [devfsd.o] Error 1
All files and directories are there. I can add, move,
remove, and
edit/save everything. But if I try to move a directory
with mc I get:
Cannot move directory "/foo" to "/bar" No such file or
directory (2)
with mc. It works with mv(1). Also I can't umount the
partitions. I'm
using ext2. Any hints ? My .config is at
http://members.nbci.com/pervalidus/.config-2.4.2.txt
Sorry, I couldn't use Mutt and Exim to send this
message:
==> /var/exim/log/exim_mainlog <==
