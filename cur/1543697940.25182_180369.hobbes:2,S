Hi there!
I'm currently fooling around with a friends laptop, a Acer Aspire
1353LC, trying to get a wireless NIC working (it's a D-Link DWL-G650
btw).
The Cardbus has never been used before so that was the first thing I
compiled in and guess what.. The kernel will freeze if not directly
after init has kicked in, well it won't survive for many minutes.
After trying 2.6.0-test10 with the same result (first tried 2.4.22) I
tried to boot with acpi=off and then it didn't freeze. At least not
until I inserted the NIC. Then the damn thing totally froze.
Any ideas?
Attached is .config for the kernels, cpuinfo and lspci -v output.
Thanks.
