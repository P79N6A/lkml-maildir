What arch-specific things need to be done?
arch-specific pcibios_disable_device may be a good idea... but in this
case it sounds like you need to put #ifdef CONFIG_ALL_PPC code in
sungem.c instead, if the power-down code is specific to gmacs.

Although some drivers already do this, you really need an inactivity
timer instead of unconditionally powering-down the hardware on
dev->stop().  dhcp and other applications will often bounce the
interface...

For power-down specifically, you should use pci-set-power-state not
pci-disable-device.  pci_disable_device is the opposite of
pci_enable_device.  pci_enable_device not only wakes up the device, but
also assigns resources.  Which implies that pci-disable-device is
allowed to un-assign resources.  There shouldn't be a problem with a net
device doing that per se, but you should be aware of the implications.
