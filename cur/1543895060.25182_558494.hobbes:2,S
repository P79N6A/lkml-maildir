Congratulations on obtaining those patents, I hope they will be used
wisely. I am however not a patent lawyer and as such in no position to
evaluate their claims.
As a more useful response, the original poster may want to look at some
of the prior work in this area, I just picked a couple,
  (Cedar File System from Xerox PARC)
    A Caching File System for a Programmer's Workstation (1985)
    Michael D. Schroeder, David K. Gifford, Roger M. Needham
  (Vax/VMS System Software Handbook)
  (TOPS-20 User's Manual)
  (Plan 9 (file system))
    Plan 9 from Bell Labs (1990)
    Rob Pike, Dave Presotto, Sean Dorward, Bob Flandrena, Ken Thompson,
    Howard Trickey, Phil Winterbottom
  (Elephant File System)
    Elephant: The File System that Never Forgets (1999)
    Douglas J. Santry, Michael J. Feeley, Norman C. Hutchinson
    Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems
    Deciding when to forget in the Elephant file system (1999)
    Douglas S. Santry, Michael J. Feeley, Norman C. Hutchinson,
    Alistair C. Veitch, Ross W. Carton, Jacob Otir
  (Ext3Cow)
    Ext3cow: The Design, Implementation, and Analysis of Metadata for a
    Time-Shifting File System (2003)
    Zachary N. J. Peterson, Randal C. Burns
Sites like portal.acm.org and citeseer.ist.psu.edu are good places to
find copies of these papers. They also provide links to other work that
either is cited by, or cites these papers which is a convenient way to
find other papers in this area.
Researching, designing and implementing such systems is a lot of fun,
admittedly often more fun than long term debugging and/or maintaining,
but that is life. Don't get too upset if the end result cannot be
included in the main kernel. Just start over from scratch, you may just
end up with an even better design the second time around.
