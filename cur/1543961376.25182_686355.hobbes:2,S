> The mapsize optimizations which were moved from x86 to the generic
> code in commit 64970b68d2b3ed32b964b0b30b1b98518fde388e increased the
> binary size on non x86 architectures.
> 
> Looking into the real effects of the "optimizations" it turned out
> that they are not used in find_next_bit() and find_next_zero_bit().
> 
> The ones in find_first_bit() and find_first_zero_bit() are used in a
> couple of places but none of them is a real hot path.
> 
> Remove the "optimizations" all together and call the library functions
> unconditionally.
> 
> Boot-tested on x86 and compile tested on every cross compiler I have.
