Which is behaviour chroot preserves properly.
The specification says explicitly
	"The process working directory is unaffected by chroot()."
chroot is not and never has been a security tool. People have built
things based upon the properties of chroot but extended (BSD jails, Linux
vserver) but they are quite different.
You could probably write yourself an LSM module to do this too
