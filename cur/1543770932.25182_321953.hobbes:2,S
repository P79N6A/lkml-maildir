A cpu_relax() there would help greatly and essentially "drops" the 
priority of the processor executing it (since 'pause' is a hint that that 
logical processor would like to yield execution resources), although there 
would still be traffic due to accessing get_cpu_var, which should be minimal as 
it'll be at most 1 non shared cacheline so you could account for it in the 
statement of errors. I used to have a personal implementation for one of 
the systems i use which does a hlt in that loop and i wake up the 
procsesor via IPI. So perhaps some kernel hacking might be required 
(albeit minimal) ;)
