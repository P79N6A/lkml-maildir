I didn't enable kobject debugging, but I did put a printk statement in
drivers/scsi/sd.c:scsi_disk_release(), which is the release routine for
the scsi_disk structure.  It does the final put_disk() call -- or at 
least, this is _supposed_ to be the final call.
With my patch, just before the call to put_disk the value of 
disk->dev.kobj.kref.refcount is 1.  Without my patch, the value is 
garbage (probably a slab poison value, but I printed it in decimal 
rather than hex so I can't be sure).
Don't you have a USB storage device?  It should be easy for you to test 
this on your own system.
