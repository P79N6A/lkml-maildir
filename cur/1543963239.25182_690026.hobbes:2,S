Hi,
I noticed that a patch from you went into 2.6.26-rc1 to adjust the PLL table
in the lxfb driver.  Unfortunately, it breaks on OLPC machines (I haven't
tested it on other Geode platforms yet, but I don't have any other Geodes
with panels anyways).  It's this commit:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=3888d4639e78802c4ec1086127124e890461b9e4
Without this patch, I get the following (correct) output from the lxfb
and console code:
[    0.939827] lxfb 0000:00:01.1: 16384 KB of video memory at 0xfd000000
[    1.009194] Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 150x56     
Without it, the cols/width is screwy (and I get a blank white screen):
[   20.706836] lxfb 0000:00:01.1: 16384 KB of video memory at 0xfd000000
[   20.788538] Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 100x40
