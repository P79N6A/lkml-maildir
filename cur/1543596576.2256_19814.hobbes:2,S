Are you sure about this?  In the tulip.c driver the following appears to be the
salient code:
static int private_ioctl(struct device *dev, struct ifreq *rq, int cmd)
{
	struct tulip_private *tp = (struct tulip_private *)dev->priv;
	long ioaddr = dev->base_addr;
	u16 *data = (u16 *)&rq->ifr_data;
	int phy = tp->phys[0] & 0x1f;
	long flags;
	switch(cmd) {
	case SIOCDEVPRIVATE:		/* Get the address of the PHY in use. */
		if (tp->mii_cnt)
			data[0] = phy;
		else if (tp->flags & HAS_NWAY143)
			data[0] = 32;
		else if (tp->chip_id == COMET)
			data[0] = 1;
		else
			return -ENODEV;
I don't see any device stopping or reading of the media interface here.  Now
there may be something very subtle hidden somewhere that I'm not seeing, but
this looks like some relatively straightforward comparisons.
