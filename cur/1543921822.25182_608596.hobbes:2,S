I have an out of tree module to do per-port (tcp/udp) bind permissions,
it works fine with the "capability" module as secondary and I can load
or unload both of them at any time... this recent change completely
breaks that. (I had to #include dummy.c though).
Why should I now need to:
1. reboot every time I change the code when I could just reload modules before?
2. put it into my kernel source tree to use it?
