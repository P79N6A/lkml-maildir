I could, but would that really make sense?
As Alexey pointed out in the previous thread :

And besides, we wouldn't ever get to the BUG_ON() because even if the
function did manage to get called it would then explode in the
  struct mxser_struct *info = tty->driver_data;
assignment, before it ever got to the BUG_ON() (that assignment could
ofcourse be moved as I did in my original patch, but that still leaves
Alexeys point in place).
