Clearly *any* problem which only happens with SMP isn't as wide-spread,
and if you are running uni then there should not be a problem. Given that
earlier and later similar chipset have a sticky bit and no problem, I
think it would be reasonable to protect people in a stable kernel. If the
config file needed to be patched and there were a warning on the next
line, that would certainly assure they knew they were taking a risk.
