For 2.2.3 (without the 2.2.2ac7 patches), a wsize of 8k appears to
be slightly faster than a wsize of 4k when writing to a BSD ffs (*) hosted 
on an i386 with a 4K page size.  (30.5 vs. 31.5 seconds for a 12 MB file)
Is this because 2.2.3 is broken compared to 2.2.7ac1 or is this
contradicting your statement that it only matters for BSD+8K pagesize
machines?

Also, what's a BSD vfs?  I was under the impression that vfs is the
name of the layer connecting OS and filesystems.
