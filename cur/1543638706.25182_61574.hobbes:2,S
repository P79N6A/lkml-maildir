I agree with your diagnosis I'm not convinced by your change. The thread
groups are only used by NGPT not by glibc pthreads while the problem is

Possibly the right fix is to remove the reparent to init increment of
self_exec_id and instead explicitly check process 1 in the signal paths.
Opinions ?
