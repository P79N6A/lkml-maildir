	In truly big systems "fsck" is completely impractical...

	0.998 availability is what ftp.funet.fi has achieved
	during last year.   It had downtime in 6 occasions,
	total accumulated time was around 20 hours.  Most of
	it was due to equipment move, during which an external
	RAID5 controller memory battery fault forced it to
	recheck the entire array parities, and that took quite
	some time...
	(Router problems causing connectivity losses occurred
	 more frequently and for longer total duration, but
	 they weren't system problems at the machine.)
	For a system like that there is *never* time when
	downtime is acceptable.  People fetching data are
	about at all times; from different parts of the world
	at different times, of course.  So the only option is
	to recover as fast as possible.
	That system reboots/remounts its disks at about rate of
	about 1 GB / sec.  It has 230 GB.  Aside of occasional
	hardware problems, system boots to full service in about
	15 minutes.
	Had there been only 7 hours downtime from all those
	reboots and moving, the availability ratio would have
	been 0.999.
	We have considered (at times) using e.g. Linux for the
	next generation server, but it won't be happening before
	there are truly enterprise class filesystems available
	for Linux (or for any other would-be candidate either).
	Any non-journaled filesystem is out of the question with
	these data volumes.  (And still the best FS I have worked
	with *anywhere* is DEC UNIX AdvFS.  Perhaps the IBM JFS
	is second best.  Volume management with SGI XFS, and
	Solaris VxFS are yet missing experiences.)
