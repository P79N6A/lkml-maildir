It is a uniprocessor machine, yes.  The machine is a 1.1GHz Athlon on a Soyo
motherboard.  This is the first problem we've seen with the machine.
The machine was and is still working mostly ok.  Since I typed "umount /opt",
the opt directory doesn't show any contents any more, but before that things
appear OK.  I can still use fdisk to look at the partition layout of the
drives in /opt raid1 array.  /proc/mdstat is normal.
There are no other software raid devices on the machine (/ is also ext3 on a
separate drive/controller).  There are no suspicious messages printed from
dmesg, either.
