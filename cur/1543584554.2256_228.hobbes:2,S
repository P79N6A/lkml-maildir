OK guys, you were right. The bug was in our code - sorry for trouble.
Turns out that while I was away, the problem was solved by someone else. The
problem is probably related to the fact that when we did
'spin_lock_irqsave(c,d)', 'd' was a global variable. The fix was to wrap the
call with another function and declare 'd' as local. I can't quite explain,
but I think that changing from a static to automatic variable made the
difference. My best guess is that since 'd' is passed by value and not by
reference, the macro expansion of spin_lock_irqsave() relies on the location
of 'd' in the stack and if 'd' was on the heap instead, it might get
trashed.
I would really like to hear your expert opinion on my assumption.
	Thanks,
	Shmulik.

Sorry, no.  If spin_lock_irqsave()/spin_unlock_irqrestore()
were accidentally reenabling interrupts then it would be
the biggest, ugliest catastrophe since someone put out a kernel
which forgot to flush dirty inodes to disk :)
Conceivably it was a compiler bug.  Were you using egcs-1.1.2/x86?
