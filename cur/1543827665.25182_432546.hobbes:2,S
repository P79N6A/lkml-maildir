We're talking about _one_ task; receiving mail to one address, and
delivering it to other addresses. That's what the MTA _does_ -- all it
needs from the mailing list side is the list of recipients.
I wouldn't want to put all the bounce processing &c into the MTA, but
basic handling of list traffic does make a certain amount of sense. In
expanding a simple list, there isn't much scope for 'rampant list
drivers' to screw anything up.

You may be right. But still, it keeps us ahead of the game and it's very
effective right now -- partly because lots of people still _aren't_
using it. It does require a modicum of clue to implement.
I think it'll be a long time before greylisting is no longer beneficial,
if it ever does happen.
