While an interface is being probed, usb_interface_claimed() will always
return true for it.  That's because the probing code sets
interface->dev.driver (which is what usb_interface_claimed() tests) before
calling the probe function.  If the probe fails then interface->dev.driver
will be reset.  This all happens inside bus_match() in drivers/base/bus.c.
For the same reason, the test of (dev->driver) in 
usb_driver_claim_interface() -- that is the test you meant, isn't it? -- 
passes (i.e., yields a true value).
