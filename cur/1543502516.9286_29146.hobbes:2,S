I'm having zero luck with pcmcia-cs-3.0.13, .14 or anything, with kernel
2.2.10-ac10.
Looks like the same thing you're reporting.  cardmgr triggers kernel oops
at init time.  I'm unable to update the kernel on that machine.  
It's an IBM ThinkPad 365X, RedHat 5.2 + kernel-2.2.x with a Linksys
10/100Base card.
