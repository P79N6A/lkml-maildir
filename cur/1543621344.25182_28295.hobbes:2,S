As you described it to me on irc, this demonstration turns up a
considerably worse problem than just having insufficient space for
page tables - the system locks up hard instead of doing anything
reasonable on page table-related oom.  It's wrong that the system
should behave this way, it is after all, just an oom.
Now that basic stability issues seem to be under control, perhaps
it's time to give the oom problem the attention it deserves?
