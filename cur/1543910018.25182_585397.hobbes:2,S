Hi Wim.
I think that's wise.
I've got all the changes that people have CC'd me.
I expect it'll be an all or nothing sort of thing.
Even if it's nothing, the content tracking parts
might be useful if another of the proposals floating
'round gets implemented.
I personally find the distributed MAINTAINERS approach
a bit odd given that there isn't really a single place
for many of the parts of a maintained block to be.
The single MAINTAINERS is too "hot" to use Linus' word.
I rather like the Maintainers/* block approach myself.
Unless that's rejected out of hand, that's what I'll
submit tomorrow.
cheers,  Joe
