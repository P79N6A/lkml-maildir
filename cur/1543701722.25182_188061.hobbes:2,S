I don't think I'm really sure what you're asking. (which driver frees hwif? why is it a problem? I see a "ide_unregister" call, it resets the hwif to default state - this should be fine.

As far as i can see "idex=base.." is broken for PCI chipsets anyway- if the detected PCI base doesn't match the forced one, the PCI will be allocated a seperate hwif (ie as a seperate ideX) anyway. So you can't force the base port of a PCI-chipset controller.
Do you mean that, if "idex=base..." is give, and the base is correct for the PCI device, then it should work ok? If so it seems the easiest way to fix it is to introduce another dummy chipset type (lets say "ide_generic_forced") which is set (instead of ide_generic) when "idex=.." is parsed. Then check for this in ide_hwif_configure(). Would also need to modify ide_match_hwif() (so it returns a match for "ide_generic_forced" as well as for "ide_generic") and ide_probe_init() would have to change "ide_generic_force" to "ide_generic" (to handle the case that no PCI chipset took control).
So we handle these situations:
- idex=... specified and no PCI chipset
- idex=... specified and PCI chipset present
- PCI chipset module loaded after ide initialization complete
Does that sound ok? If so I will write another patch.
