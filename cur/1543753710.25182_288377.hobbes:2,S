But Ingo is someone who
 - is a known allround kernel hacker
 - has a trackrecord of getting things done that actually get used
 - lowlevel CPU knowledge
 - is able to comunicate with other developers very well
 - is able to make good tradeoffs
 - has taste
most of that can't be said for your personal heroes

No, the kernel initialization is not complex at all.  complexity != code size

You stated that a few time.  Now let's welcome you to reality:
 - Linus doesn't want to make the tradeoffs for segment based NX-bit
   emulation in mainline at all
 - Ingo and his collegues at Red Hat want to have it, but they don't
   want to break application nor introduce the addition complexity
   of the PaX code.
Is is that hard to understand?
