I've asked this question twice now.  The only response I've gotten (that
I've noticed) is from someone who's having a similar problem.  If this
is the wrong place to ask this question, then I'd appreciate it if
someone could recommend where I should ask it.
Anyway, the problem I'm having is that the wheel on my mouse (Logitech
Cordless Wheel Mouse) does not work after upgrading to a newer kernel
(I've tried two different 2.2.x kernels.  The wheel worked fine in the
2.0.x kernels, though.  When doing a simple "cat /dev/mouse," I of
course get garbage for doing anything with the mouse except the wheel. 
In 2.0.x, that was different.  Any suggestions?
