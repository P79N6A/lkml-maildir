All,
Here's the FS Control Dispatcher for the NT Version of NWFS on Windows
2000.  You will note that there is an IRP for VERIFY_VOLUME.  This is
the code that actually recovers failing file systems (like FSCK on
Linux).  Since this interface not well documented, it's no surprise that
Michael doesn't know about it.
Please look over the attached.  
Jeff
