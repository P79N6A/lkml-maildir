Subject: [PATCH] devres: release resources on device_del()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/9/109

Some platform devices are driven without driver attached, so managed
resources can be acquired without driver attached.  Make sure such
resources are released by calling devres_release_all() in
device_del().

This one fixes oops on pata_platform and pata_legacy unload.  libata
being the only user of devres at the moment.  I think this can go
through libata-dev#upstream.
