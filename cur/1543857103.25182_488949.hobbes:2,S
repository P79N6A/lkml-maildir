Yeah, I had a very similar patch queued internally for the large benchmark
measurement.  I will post the result as soon as I get it.

I took a quick query of biovec-* slab stats on various production machines,
majority of the allocation is on 1 and 4 segments, usages falls off quickly
on 16 or more.  256 segment biovec allocation is really rare.  I think it
makes sense to heavily bias towards smaller biovec allocation and have
separate biovec allocation for really large ones.
