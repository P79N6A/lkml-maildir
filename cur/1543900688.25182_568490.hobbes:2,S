This is not what we're going to do.  There is a plan to block tasks on I/O if
they request it during a suspend.

I think so.  The suspend-to-RAM mode is quite specific and on some platform
(ie. ACPI) it requires platform support.
We've already reached the conclusion that it's better to separate suspend from
hibernation, as far as device drivers are concerned, and let's not repeat the
discussion.

Exactly.
