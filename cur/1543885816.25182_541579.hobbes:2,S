malloc has per-thread arenas, so when using MADV_FREE the pages
should be local to the thread as well (unless the thread has switched
to a different CPU also to the CPU) and in case of sysbench should
be cache hot as well (it is reused RSN).  With MADV_DONTNEED you need to
clear the pages while that is not necessary with MADV_FREE.
