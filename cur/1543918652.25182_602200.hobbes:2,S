We have wbc->pages_skipped for that :-)

It's not wbc.more_io, but the context(wbc.pages_skipped > 0) indicates
a blockade:
        
if (wbc.nr_to_write > 0 || wbc.pages_skipped > 0) {    /* all-written or blockade... */
        if (wbc.encountered_congestion || wbc.more_io) /* blockade! */
                congestion_wait(WRITE, HZ/10);
        else                                           /* all-written! */
                break;
}
We can also read the whole background_writeout() logic as
while (!done) {
        /* sync _all_ sync-able data */
        congestion_wait(100ms);
}
And an example run could be:
sync 1000MB, skipped 100MB
congestion_wait(100ms);
sync 100MB, skipped 10MB
congestion_wait(100ms);
sync 10MB, all done
Note that it's far from "wait 100ms for every 4MB" (which is merely
the worst possible case).

Ah, that was out of my imagination. Maybe we could do with
        if (wbc.more_io)
                congestion_wait(WRITE, 1);
It's at least 10 times better.

"going mad" means "busy waiting".

Hmm, congestion_wait(WRITE, 1) could re-establish the balance ;-)
Which waits <10ms for HZ=100.

Sure, the queues should be filled as fast as possible.
How fast can we fill the queue? Let's measure it:

It's an Intel Core 2 2.93GHz CPU and a SATA disk.
The trace shows that
- there's no congestion_wait() called in wb_kupdate()
- it takes wb_kupdate() ~15ms to sync every 4MB 
So I guess congestion_wait(WRITE, 1) will be more than enough.
However, wb_kupdate() is syncing the data a bit slow(4*1000/15=266MB/s),
could it be because of a lot of cond_resched()?
