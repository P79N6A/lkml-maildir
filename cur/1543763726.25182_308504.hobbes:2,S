* It's one of those modern bios, no way of configuring that.
* It seems to me that it detects only 1 card with 1 only codec which is 
the sound card (sound works if i avoid the null pointer oops). So one of 
the problems is the wrong detection.
Googling i found that  jgarzik already got a patch for this 
(ac97_codec.c:158):
+    {0x43585430, "CXT48",            &default_ops,        
AC97_DELUDED_MODEM },
* About fixing i810_probe/i810_ac97_init, the safest and simplest 
solution may be changing "continue" for "break" (i810_audio.c:3089), 
i.e. give up scanning for sound codecs when the first modem is found. I 
don't if that would prevent any real-world device from working, but the 
alternative is add a lot of checks everywhere.
See you.
