Hello,
Imagine a card that implements PPP in its own firmware (i.e. it doesn't
use pppd), and this firmware talks to a driver in the kernel. How can this
card do user authentication??
I understand how pppd does it (from userspace), but I don't know how a
driver in the kernel can do the authentication directly (from
kernelspace).
Is it possible?? Is there any driver that already does it?? What's the
infrastructure (if any) that the driver should use in order to do that??
Thanks in advance for your help!
Regards,
Ivan
