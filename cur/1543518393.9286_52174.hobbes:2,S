They are no longer desirable for maintanance reasons the moment they are
made obsolete.  Currently they can be removed almost immediately, after the
drivers in the source tree have been changed to work with the new interface.
If you have to wait X amount of time before you can remove, old, buggy,
unmaintained, insecure, etc, interfaces, things become evil.

Because binary compatability *isn't assured*, and assuring it would create a
huge burden preventing things being changed in the kernel incase some binary
only module uses some buggy interface that creates huge security holes..
