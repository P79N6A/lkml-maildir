Cool.

I didn't mean to imply this. I love ext2 and still use it more than
probably any other filesystem (judging by numbers of partitions).
I simply was hoping for insted of:
 <*> EXT2 fs
 <*> EXT3 fs
(which is required today for most ext3-using people who want to do ext2
mounts)
... there could be:
 <*> EXT2 fs
 <*>   EXT3 journalling extensions
AFAIK this would eliminate a lot of duplicate kernel code for ext3
users.
But anyway, I'm not saying that ext2 should be made obsolete. I only
use ext3 on one machine and I would be much more annoyed if I had to
enable ext3 on the other machines than live with my current situation
of needing both ext2 and ext3 in the kernel on this particular one.
I think you understand ;-).
