   The same (or related) thing happens with my Acer Travelmate 723TXV. Loading 
the module would lock the machine, but only if i had started Windows 98 before and 
warm booted the machine. After a cold boot, it would complain of a shared resource 
(?) problem, and quit. I have yet to check that fix you mention.
