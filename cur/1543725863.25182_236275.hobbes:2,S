Thanks, it seems especially the network chip (Realtek 8139) is similar,
and both have a graphics chip based on radeon (although this one is an
integrated thing).
I have put more detailed information (dmesg, lsmod,
config, lspci -v) on 
http://users.telenet.be/fhimpe/kernelbug/
 . Maybe you
could also make it available somewhere?
Is there a kernel hacker who could give us any clue about what we can do
to get more information to find the exact cause and to solve this problem?
