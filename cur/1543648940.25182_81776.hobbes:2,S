   We'll, if everybody stopped using net-tools and started using iproute2 the
   world would be a better place
'iproute2' would need to be able to obtain things, such as
the snmp statistics, some other way.  Currently /proc/net/snmp
is the only place these values are provided.
Ditto for UDP socket listings et al.  Only tcp_diag has moved
the TCP socket information into the non-proc realm of netlink.
If these facilities existed already, I'd agree with you.
