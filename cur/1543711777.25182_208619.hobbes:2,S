36% regression due to the CPU scheduler changes?  ow.
And that machine is a PIII, so presumably the setting of CONFIG_SCHED_SMT
makes no difference.
From a quick look at the material you have there it appears that this
workload also is very I/O bound.  It's a little surprising that the CPU
scheduler could make so much difference.
