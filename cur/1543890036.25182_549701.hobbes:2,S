I measured vmclear time on an uncached vmcs (which would be all except 
for a handful which are cached on the cpu core) at 144 cycles.  Assuming 
a couple of cache misses for walking the list and accessing the vmcs, 
we're at about 500 cycles per vcpu, or 250us @ 2GHz.  So worst case is 
significantly less than 1 ms.
Is this acceptable for take_cpu_down()?
