Is this really a kernel bug?  I have a floppy drive that does the same thing;
it doesn't always notify the kernel that the media changed.  I can force it
with your workaround *or* by being very careful when inserting the new
floppy.
Of course, if it doesn't happen with 2.0.x then it is a kernel bug.  DOS
never showed the problem on this system; I think it always reread the media
regardless.  (OS/2 did show the problem, though.)

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
