Subject: Mixer on ESS0968 messed up since 2.2.0-pre5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Everything was working fine up until 2.2.0p5, with and without AC
patches, 2.2.0p4 without any patches works fine, can try with the AC
patches once I can get to them again..
What happens is that I get a new mixer setting (Rec), and the main
volume control stops working, I have not tried recording with the newer
kernels, but I could if needed..
My .config is attached..
