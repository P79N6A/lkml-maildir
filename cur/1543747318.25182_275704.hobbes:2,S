At offset 0 in the BIOS segment of 0x40, real address 0x400, are
the addresses of up to 4 ports for the serial communications
devices, followed by up to 4 port addresses of any parallel
communications devices found by the BIOS upon startup. This
is likely what he meant. The code shown will return the address
of the first RS-232 device (usually a 8250 UART) found.
