oops, looks like I e-mailed and attached a diff that was
from before I built and tested.  The version in git
has one line different -- includes actypes.h as you suggest.
I've updated the attachment in the bug report above to match git.
note that the definitions of acpi_cpu_flags
and acpi_thread_id are not un-needed.  Indeed,
they must occur in aclinux.h above where actypes.h
is included or the ACPICA defaults would be used
and that would break the Linux build.
thanks,
