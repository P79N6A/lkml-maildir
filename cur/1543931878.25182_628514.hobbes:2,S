A few comments:
Report counts may be too high due to duplicate recognition of the very
same report.¹
Reports against 2.6.X-rcY-mmZ are listed in the same category as reports
against 2.6.X-rcY.  To distinguish -mm reports from vanilla reports, one
has to look into the details of each bug entry.¹
A general weakness is that it is ultimately impossible to know whether a
report was against an unpatched kernel, unless one drills down to the
individual mailinglist threads.
Reports about tainted kernels have arguably less value.  It would be
good to hide such reports until a report of the same oops in an
untainted kernel was found.
