Not at all! Standard says as well: you can not specify ANY arguments. So
when you specify ANY argument you are out of standard scope. Look this
way: sqrt(x) ALWAYS >= 0. But if you'll try to specify x < 0 you are out
of luck. Usually sqrt will not even have return value at all :-)) Or (if
sqrt will not convinience you). free(3) does not have return value at all.
(according to standard!). But try to call free with random arguments and
you'll see what happens.

No. Standard says: you must use this things this way. IF you'll use
thing in specified order you'll get predictable result. If you try to use
thing any other way you'll get some implementation-specific response.
