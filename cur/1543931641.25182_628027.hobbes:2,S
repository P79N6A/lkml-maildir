Or just apply my latest patch (cf Undo __scsi_kill_request).
The main point is that we shouldn't retry requests
with FAILFAST set when the queue is blocked. AFAICS
only FC and iSCSI transports set the queue to blocked,
and use this to indicate a loss of connection. So any
retry with queue blocked is futile.
Cheers,
Hannes
