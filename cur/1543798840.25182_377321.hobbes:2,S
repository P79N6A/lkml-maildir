Subject: [PATCH] micro optimization of cache_estimate in slab.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

OK, I know this is really just a micro optimization, but I figured I'd
submit it anyway.  Looking into the slab code, I came across the
cache_estimate function, which has the following code:
	i = 0;
	while (i*size + ALIGN(base+i*extra, align) <= wastage)
		i++;
	if (i > 0)
		i--;
Now this is counting linearly up and will be O(n) for n = number of
objects in the page order. Since objects range up to 202 (according to
my /proc/slabinfo). So I figured there must be a better way.  So I added
this:
	i = 0;
	do {
		x = 1;
		while ((x+i)*size + ALIGN(base+(x+i)*extra, align) <= wastage)
			x <<= 1;
		i += (x >> 1);
	} while (x > 1);
Which now makes it O(log n).  This basically does a binary search for
the upper range.  I tested this code in userspace, and it works just the
same as the original code, but with less iterations.
I know this is really a micro optimization, but if you think every usec
counts, then we can use this patch ;)
