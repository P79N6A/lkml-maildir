You're right. If I would have a solution, which could do this, I would
prefer it.

It's easy: for security reasons. There could always be some bugs in some
software, which makes it possible for some other user, to gain root
privileges. Now, they could easily strace for information, they shouldn't
could do it. The password they could see, isn't just used for the DB, but
for some other applications, too. That's the disadvantage of general
(single sign on) passwords.
