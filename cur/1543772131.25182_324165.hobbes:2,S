Subject: [patch 02/09] [NETFILTER]: Fix deadlock with ip_queue and tcp local input path
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/6/8/288

When we have ip_queue being used from LOCAL_IN, then we end up with a
situation where the verdicts coming back from userspace traverse the TCP
input path from syscall context.  While this seems to work most of the
time, there's an ugly deadlock:
syscall context is interrupted by the timer interrupt.  When the timer
interrupt leaves, the timer softirq get's scheduled and calls
tcp_delack_timer() and alike.  They themselves do bh_lock_sock(sk),
which is already held from somewhere else -> boom.
I've now tested the suggested solution by Patrick McHardy and Herbert Xu to
simply use local_bh_{en,dis}able().
