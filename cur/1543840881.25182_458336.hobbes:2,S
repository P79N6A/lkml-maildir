I'm not saying per use glibc etc.  That will indeed be useless and bring
it to virtualization world.  Just like fake node, one should be allowed
to use pages that are already in  (for example) page cache- so that you
don't end up duplicating all shared stuff.  But as far as charging is
concerned, charge it to container who either got the page in page cache
OR if FS based semantics exist then charge it to the container where the
file belongs.  What I was suggesting is to not charge a page to
different counters.
