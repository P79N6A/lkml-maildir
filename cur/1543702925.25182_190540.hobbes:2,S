Subject: initialize data not at file scope - WTF?

In include/linux/init.h, it says:
   For initialized data:
   You should insert __initdata between the variable name and equal
   sign followed by value, e.g.:
   static int init_variable __initdata = 0;
   static char linux_logo[] __initdata = { 0x32, 0x36, ... };
   Don't forget to initialize data not at file scope, i.e. within a
   function, as gcc otherwise puts the data into the bss section and not
   into the init section.
Does this mean that __initdata can't be used for file scope variables,
that it can only be used for file scope variables, or something else?
Thanks!
