I suspect nuke-buffers is simply always the right thing to do.  It's
what 2.5 is doing now (effectively).  We'll see...
But in your case, you only have a couple of gigs of memory, iirc.
You shouldn't be running into catastrophic buffer_head congestion.
Something odd is happening.
If you can provide a really detailed set of steps which can be
used by others to reproduce this, that would really help.
