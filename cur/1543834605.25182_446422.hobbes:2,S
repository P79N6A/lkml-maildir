I will try and reproduce it here now. It seems to be in between commit
271f18f102c789f59644bb6c53a69da1df72b2f4 and commit
dd67d051529387f6e44d22d1d5540ef281965fdd where the first one could also
be bad.
I'm assuming that acf421755593f7d7bd9352d57eda796c6eb4fa43 should be
good, so you can try and verify that
dd67d051529387f6e44d22d1d5540ef281965fdd is bad and bisect between the
two. It's only about 6 commits, so should be quick enough to do.
