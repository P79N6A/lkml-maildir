One solution to this would be to make SYSRQ a sequencing key rather
than a shift key as it currently appears to be. This would require
special precautions to be taken to ensure that it couldn't happen
accidentally.
One solution would be to define the sequence SYSRQ ESC as being the
leadin sequence required to get into this mode, with SYSRQ preceding
any other character just being quietly discarded. On every keyboard
I've seen, SYSRQ is towards the right hand side of the keyboard and
ESC towards the LEFT hand side, so it is very unlikely that they would
be pressed in sequence accidentally.
Given this solution, the keyboard would treat the sequence SYSRQ ESC
(including the release codes) as moving the keyboard into SYSRQ state,
and the first key following that as moving back into NORMAL state.
Best wishes from Riley.
