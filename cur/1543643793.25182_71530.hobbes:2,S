you are right, i was confusing this with the older check for disabled
interrupt in preempt_schedule() [which i'd still find useful].
The smp_processor_id() test catches true preemption bugs. So does
preempt_count() underflow detection.
i do agree with Alan - there can be nothing bad in trying to fix all that
non-preempt-aware code right now, before it becomes too late.
