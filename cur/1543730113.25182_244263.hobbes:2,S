As I said, it's a slightly better example.
(it's also NOT what the patch was changing)

See, that's a problem. You're limiting yourself to
just 96 of the 456 listed operations, which are only
1/5 of the 2304 available operations.
I do admit to using bne at times. The bit manipulation
stuff is different though. It's not so cryptic in the
raw form. The same goes for using "or" to copy a register.
If you don't use the full bit manipulation notation
all the time, you might forget what it can do. Then
you'll end up using 2 instructions where one would do.

OK, that's 8. Dividing 456 by that, I still see a 57:1 ratio.
There's also that matter of the 1848 operations you can't
access via the "simplified" instruction names.
