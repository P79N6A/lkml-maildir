I am assuming that you have an ix86 kind of machine.
It's probably mangled because you had a hardware-crash.
If you have a driver that accesses the RTC, it needs to leave
the index register at offset 0 so that a hardware crash can
only upset the seconds. Otherwise, even the RTC checksum
can get screwed up, forcing manual reconfiguration of the
BIOS.
During a hardware-crash, the chip enables may go TRUE. This
means that an RTC write can occur with junk that's on the
data-bus.
Now, you need to find out why you had a hardware-crash which
is quite unlike a software-crash. A hardware crash occurs when
you turn OFF the power or the power-good line from the
power-supply goes FALSE. You do not get a hardware-crash from
hitting the reset button. You may have induced the RTC failure
if you hit the power switch instead of the reset button.

Doesn't the `init` script ask you if you want to fsck the
drive? Most distributions do. Anyways, a time in the future
is one of the ways e2fsck may discover that your file-system
is dorked. You certainly don't want it to ignore it by default.
