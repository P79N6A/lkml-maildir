Hey, you don't have to try to convince me - I haven't been arguing against 
the reiser4 approach. I think it's a prototyping scheme, and quite frankly 
I don't think you _can_ get the name lookup right without real VFS support 
(races, namespaces etc are just not something you can solve in the 
filesystem). 
But the fact that name lookup does seriously need VFS support means that I 
don't think we want to merge reiser4 as-is. No way. That doesn't mean that 
I think reiser4 was _wrong_.
And I certainly agree that there are personality issues, and they are not 
all just Hans' ;)
