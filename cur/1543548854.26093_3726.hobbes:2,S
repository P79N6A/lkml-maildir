Latency is a function of time, but the units of time need not be seconds and could be requests.
In theory.  In this particular case, measuring time in units of requests is inappropriate.
We have a choice between having users (or device driver authors
for the defaults) estimate how many milliseconds is reasonable for a given device, or having them
estimate how many requests can be guaranteed to not exceed the time they can wait for a particular
device.  I would rather take responsibility for knowing not to get unreasonable in the smallness of
my MP3 buffering for a floppy device experiencing multiple processes accessing it for reasons of
performance effects being disastrous than take responsibility for estimating how many requests will
not
add up to more than X milliseconds of buffer on my hard drive.
Number of requests is irrelevant to realtime I/O scheduling, seconds are relevant to realtime
I/O scheduling.
There are two problems to be solved: fairness, and realtime I/O scheduling.  Fairness can be handled
effectively by measuring time in units of requests.  Guaranteeing maximum latencies requires
traditional time units.
