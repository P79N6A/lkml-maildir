A datapoint that might be interesting:
I run four of these buggers with eepros as Internet-Interfaces for
heavy traffic (30-80 MBit sustained 24/7) under 2.2.19. Not a single
glitch on each of these boxes. The machines have two PIII/1GHz each
and a (custom built) SMP kernel based off RH 2.2.19-6.2.7

eepro100.c: VA Linux custom, Dragan Stancevic <visitor@valinux.com> 2000/11/15
eth0: Intel PCI EtherExpress Pro100 82557, 00:D0:B7:A8:67:EC, I/O at 0x2c00, IRQ 21.
  Board assembly 000000-000, Physical connectors present: RJ45
  Primary interface chip i82555 PHY #1.
  General self-test: passed.
  Serial sub-system self-test: passed.
  Internal registers self-test: passed.
  ROM checksum self-test: passed (0x04f4518b).
So there may be a change between 2.2 and 2.4 that triggers the problems.
	Regards
