It's weird, because the only change for CFQ in that area is the one
below. Does the oops go away if you back this out?

Subject: [PATCH] cfq-iosched: fix race between exiting queue and exiting task
Original patch from Nikanth Karthikesan <knikanth@suse.de>
When a queue exits the queue lock is taken and cfq_exit_queue() would free all
the cic's associated with the queue.
But when a task exits, cfq_exit_io_context() gets cic one by one and then
locks the associated queue to call __cfq_exit_single_io_context. It looks like
between getting a cic from the ioc and locking the queue, the queue might have
exited on another cpu.
Fix this by rechecking the cfq_io_context queue key inside the queue lock
again, and not calling into __cfq_exit_single_io_context() if somebody
beat us to it.
