No more complexity to the kernel or to the build process?
If you don't care for the build process, here is an idea:
1.) The linker collects all the init-calls in a special section.
2.) We can access this section with objcopy.
Idea: extract the section from the final vmlinux file,
perform a topological sort according to some kind of
description file and put the section back into the binary.
Problem solved.
