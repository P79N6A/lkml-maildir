Hi,
I have exactly the same problem with 2.4.2 (RH Linux 7.1 - IIRC)
and IBM DTLA - 307040
I think the problem is in VIA82CXX support in 2.4.2
At least for vt8233
With current 2.4.16 (and 2.4.17-rc2) my disk works realy nice (37-38 Mb/s)
So I think you must get new kernel
and recompile it with
VIA82CXX support:
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_VIA82CXXX=y
> [root@xyz jfl]# /sbin/hdparm -d1 -X66 /dev/hda
btw please use 
/sbin/hdparm -d1 -X69 /dev/hda
instead (if you need UATA100)
