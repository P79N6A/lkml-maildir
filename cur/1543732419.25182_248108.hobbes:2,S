Subject: [patch] voluntary-preempt-2.6.9-rc1-bk4-Q8
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

i've released the -Q8 patch:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.9-rc1-bk4-Q8
ontop of:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/diff-bk-040828-2.6.8.1.bz2
this release fixes an artificial 0-1msec delay between hardirq arrival
and softirq invocation. This should solve some of the ALSA artifacts
reported by Mark H Johnson. It should also solve the rtl8139 problems -
i've put such a card into a testbox and with -Q7 i had similar packet
latency problems while with -Q8 it works just fine.
So netdev_backlog_granularity is still a value of 1 in -Q8, please check
whether the networking problems (bootup and service startup and latency)
problems are resolved. (and increase this value in case there are still
problems.)
