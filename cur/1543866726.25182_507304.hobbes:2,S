If the parent is going to schedule(), someone above has already dropped 
the parent's task_struct inside a wait queue, so the *parent* will be the 
wakeup target [1].
Linus take to the generic AIO is a neat one, but IMO continuos fork/exits 
are going to be expensive. Even if the task is going to sleep, that does 
not mean that the parent (well, in Linus case, the child actually) does 
not have more stuff to feed to async(). IMO the frequency of AIO 
submission and retrieval can get pretty high (hence the frequency of 
fork/exit), and there might be a price to pay for it at the end.
IMO one solution, following the non-fibril way, may be:
- Keep a pool of per-process threads (a per-process pool already has stuff 
  like "files" already correctly setup, just for example - no need to 
  teach everywhere around the kernel of the "async" special case)
- When a schedule happen on the submission thread, we get a thread 
  (task_struct really) of the available pool
- We setup the submission (now going to sleep) thread return IP to an 
  async_complete (or whatever name) stub. This will drop a result in a 
  queue, and wake the async_wait (or whatever name) wait queue head
- We may want to swap at least the PID (signals, ...?) between the two, so 
  even if we're re-emrging with a new task_struct, the TID will be the same
- We make the "returning" thread to come back to userspace through some 
  special helper ala ret_from_fork (ret_from_async ?)
- We want also to keep a record (hash?) of userspace cookies and threads 
  currently servicing them, so that we can implement cancel (send signal)
Open issues:
- What if the pool becomes empty since all thread are stuck under schedule?
  o Grow the pool (and delay-shrink at quiter times)?
  o Make the caller really sleep?
  o Fall back in queue-request mode?
- Look at the Devil hiding in the details and showing up many times during 
  the process
Yup, I can see Zach having a lot of fun with it ;)
[1] Well, you could add a list_head to the task_struct, and teach the 
    add-to-waitqueue to drop a reference to all the wait queue entries 
    hosting the task_struct. Then walk&fix (likely be only one entry) when 
    you swap the submission thread context (thread_info, per_call stuff, ...) 
    over a service thread task_struct. At that point you can re-emerge 
    with the same task_struct. Pretty nasty though.
