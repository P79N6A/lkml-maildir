Subject: 2.5.55: static compilation of mxser.c doesn't work

Hi Arnaldo,
the 2.5 Linux kernel contains your patch
   o mxser: add module_exit/module_init
   This fixes the compilation problem in 2.5
This patch renames mxser_init to mxser_module_init causing a compile 
error when trying to compile this driver statically into the kernel 
since mxser_init is still called from drivers/char/tty_io.c.
