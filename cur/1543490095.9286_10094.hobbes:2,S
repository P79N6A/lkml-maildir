No. ncpmount works for me, with one odd exception:
The first ncpmount *always* fail with "NO IPX interface present"
Retrying a few seconds later is just as bad.  Wait 10s-20s and
everything works fine. 
I have IPX and the token ring driver compiled as modules.  
It has been like this from 2.1.125 to 2.2.3
