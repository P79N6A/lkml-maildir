I was talking about percentage saved; That 5.2% easily drops below 2% 
once other things start sucking up power.  I was thinking that way since 
the percentage saved is what determines the overall battery life 
increase.  You're right in that the absolute power draw difference 
should stay the same, and that seems to be the case is Marc's tests 
(ignoring the brokenness of artsd).

True, but I think a lot of distros treat the values as recommendations. 
  I guess we'll find out what they do with this option soon enough.

Yeah, but if its only the default value for servers and laptops they 
won't normally be running my app.  I'll be truly happy the day I can 
delete all the busy-waiting code, as I think its about the ugliest 
workaround in modern computing.

Well maybe if we can get enough people who agree then it could happen. 
I think a "laptop-config" and "server-config" file could fit nicely into 
the current arch/*/config/ directory structure.  I'm not sure how those 
defconfig files are kept up to date though.
