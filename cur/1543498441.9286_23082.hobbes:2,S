Um, quite frankly, why would anyone use the stock kernel anyway?  The
point of the stock kernel is to get the system running well enough to get
a custom compiled kernel, IMHO.
Besides, the stock kernel for RH 6.0 isn't all that good anyway - I get
TONS better performance on my own compiled kernels... and not NEARLY as
much space in modules.
