What does often mean? This is the Open Source Linux, and here we can do
changes to the source if it is good for securtiy, architecture, speat,
whatever.
Of course a solution which does the right thing without programming is even
better - Watermarking or something. But I guess wie can combine those. The
typical internet server has already enough cruft for chrooting, priveledge
dropping and FD passing to work around for example port priveledges, a REAL
solution wont make it worse.
