Well, I hate to say it, but it seems, it doesn't work, or at least not 
so well, (running hot, but stability seems to be there) with 2.6.3-mm2. 
Like I had 52°C mostly idle with your patch and APIC just a few moments 
ago. Now back to PIC within a few minutes I am back to 45°C...7°C is too 
much of a difference for me.
To be honest, I can't remenber how it was with the older kernel and I 
haven't tested temp of apic_tack patch with 2.6.3-mm2, but for the 
moment I am back to PIC. (My CPU is running at 11x200MHz, 1,7vcore btw.)
Cheers,
Prakash
