Although it fixes it for building on 32 bit architectures, won't changing
	__u64 uid = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF;
to
	__u64 uid = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFULL;
generate a type mismatch warning on ppc64 and similar 64 bit
architecutres since __u64 is not a unsigned long long on ppc64 
(it is unsigned long)?  My gut reaction is to just ingore the three
places that cause warnings and the remaining two places that cause 
signed/unsigned compare warnings of unsigned int local variables 
to #defined literals (which presumably are treated as signed by default).
