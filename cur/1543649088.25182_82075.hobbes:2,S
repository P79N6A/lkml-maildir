Nope.
It's mainly there for the other VM/MM/IO developers to
integrate against.
Also for getting their more experimental work more testing and exposure.  
Also for getting external testing of the performance work
which is going into it.
Also for maintainers of other architectures to pick up breakage
before things break.
I prefer to only send things which I understand and have tested.
So that excludes, say, dcache-rcu and the EA/xattr patches.  I
did send ext3-htree, but it had big "I haven't tested this" labels
all over it.
