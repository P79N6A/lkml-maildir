Well, it looks to me like it all falls over once it hits usermode;
everything up till then is identical (except for the Xen-related
initcalls which naturally don't exist in the non-Xen case).
I'm at a loss.  I don't know if there's some way to debug the initrd in
more detail.  I suspect that its failing all PCI probing, rather being a
specific SCSI/AHCI problem (since none of the other messages appear either).
Does the Xen case just hang, or reboot, or what?  The kernel messages
just appear to stop.  I'd expect it to at least complain about not
mounting the root filesystem or something.
Andi, any thoughts about how to debug the suse boot sequence?
