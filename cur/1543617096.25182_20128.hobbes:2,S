Gosh, not really.  The nature of the preempt patch is to allow
preemption on completion of the interrupt that put the contending task
back in the run list.  This can not be done if a spin lock is held, so
yes, there is a test on exit from the spin lock, but the point is that
this is only needed when the lock is release, not in unlocked code.
The utility of most of the ll patches is that they address the problem
within locked regions.  This is why there is a lock-break patch that is
designed to augment the preempt patch.  It picks up several of the long
held spin locks and pops out of them early to allow preemption, and then
relocks and continues (after picking up the pieces, of course).
