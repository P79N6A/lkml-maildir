Thanks for the report. I'm assuming you're describing a single hyperthread P4 
here in SMP mode so 2 logical cores. Can you elaborate on whether there is 
any difference as to which cpu things are bound to as well? Can you also see 
what happens with lame not niced to +5 (ie at 0) and with lame at nice +19.
Thanks.
