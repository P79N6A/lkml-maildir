That doesn't seem to pull up a thread.  However, I assume it's these
figures:

On the comparable figures, which only seem to be IPoIB they're showing a
13-18% variance, aren't they?  Which isn't an incredible difference.

The two target architectures perform essentially identical functions, so
there's only really room for one in the kernel.  Right at the moment,
it's STGT.  Problems in STGT come from the user<->kernel boundary which
can be mitigated in a variety of ways.  The fact that the figures are
pretty much comparable on non IB networks shows this.
I really need a whole lot more evidence than at worst a 20% performance
difference on IB to pull one implementation out and replace it with
another.  Particularly as there's no real evidence that STGT can't be
tweaked to recover the 20% even on IB.
