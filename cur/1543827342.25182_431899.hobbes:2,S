Rather than inject emotions let's play a little bit with facts. This is
excerpts from a SpamAssassin report for about 82000 emails.

People here should be smart enough to draw their own conclusions from
raw data.
IMAO, on the whole SPF is not a tool sufficiently good to use as a tool
for rejecting email in and of itself. It is good as a part of a full
anti-spam suite in a half hearted manner. A pass MAY be worthy of a
small negative score for a tool like SpamAssassin. A fail of any kind
is not worth much more than ignoring the fact that it happened. It is
most useful in conjunction with other rejection tools that are based
on identity - typically IP block lists.
As it turns out it has proven quite simple for spammers to get around
with DNS cache poisoning and other techniques. One such trick is a
false DNS record that has an spf record allowing access to the entire
IP world.
Using SPF exclusively is as silly a mugg's game as relying 100% on
the likes of SORBS.
