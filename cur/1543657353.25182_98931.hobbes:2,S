So set your tabwidth/shiftwidth/whatever to 0 (or 1, at least vim
does not seem to allow you to set a zero shiftwidth).

Well, I disagree. But I agree that the amount of indenting used is
a highly personal thing, and I find forcing a set limit by demanding
people use spaces a bad practice. But I don't do any kernel work,
so my opinion is probably of little value here.
