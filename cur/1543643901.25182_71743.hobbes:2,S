Cced back to lkml as I hate taking things off-line unless it's
necessary, archives are your friend.

No, that's enough to register your driver as a PCI driver.  I'm guessing
your pci hotplug controller looks like a PCI device?

See drivers/hotplug/pci_hotplug.h for the interface that a pci hotplug
controller driver needs to interface with (specifcly the
pci_hp_register() and pci_hp_unregister() functions are what you need).

I'm confused, are you talking about a normal PCI card driver, or a PCI
Hotplug controller driver?  What exactly does your driver do?  Does it
talk to a specific PCI card, or does it control power to PCI slots?
