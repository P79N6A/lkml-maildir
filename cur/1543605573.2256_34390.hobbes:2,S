The IA64 patch adds -g to CFLAGS.  All the debugging information bloats
vmlinux.  For the bootable kernel, I run
  strip -g vmlinux -o /boot/efi/vmlinux
You can boot from the unstripped vmlinux, the IA64 loader ignores the
debug data.  But the oversized kernels are slower to load and they take
up a lot of space in /boot/efi.  Don't understand your compile problem,
  make -j4 modules vmlinux
works for me in native IA64 mode (not cross compiling).
