I've just tried booting up 2.6.22-rc1-+a-day-or-two and my nx6125 has
lost fan control again. It doesn't sound like that's an expected
result of this patch series, but it seems unlikely that it's due to
anything but the ACPI merge.
Shall I bisect, or do you have enough to go on, given the long history
of grief that this laptop has caused you?
