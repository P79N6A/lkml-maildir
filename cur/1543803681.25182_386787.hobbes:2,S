That is true, thin MACs usually don't filter beacons on the same channel.
But in some cases (mainly power saving), you really want to avoid
receiving useless beacons and having the host woken up for each of them.
You may even want to not receive all the useful ones (the ones coming from
the AP you're joined with) if your softmac allows that.
This kind of beacon filtering is a big power saver, which is one of the
most important requirement for some platforms (phones, PDA, etc...).
Cheers,
Samuel.
