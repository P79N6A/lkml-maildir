Have you tried the lm_sensors package at 
http://www.netroedge.com/~lm78/
 ? 
It works on my Tyan Trinity AT S1590S which has the same I2C interface
(same VIA chipset) and a GL518 monitoring chip. It also does some neat
(but not necessarily useful) things like letting you read SDRAM SPD
EEPROMs over SMBus. 
This should probably go into the 2.3.x tree sometime, as it appears to
support a lot of different hardware; it looks like right now the devel
kernel only has enough I2C/SMBus stuff to control some Video4Linux
devices. But I suppose the lm_sensors developers will speak up when they
think it's ready :)
