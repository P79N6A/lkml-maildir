Well, pstools combined with existing userspace tools.  I think the
older version of stacker outputed comma-delimited output for each
module.  But that requires changes in the selinux userspace tools for
things to work at all.  That doesn't mean it's not the better way to
solve the problem.  So for instance we could output
staff_u:staff_r:serge_t(selinux),jail3(bsdjail)
-serge
