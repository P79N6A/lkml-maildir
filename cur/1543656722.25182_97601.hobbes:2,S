just as some background nortel completed it's aquisition of alteon in 
early 2000. the acenic became the netgear ga620t along with a similar 3com 
card, these are no longer on the market. like packet engines (aquired by 
alcatel) the products and technologies these companies brought to market 
have largely disappeared or died within the respective corprate parents...
