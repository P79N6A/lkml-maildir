I don't know...  Normally *_init() routines can't fail, but this could.  
Then things like device_register() would run into trouble: The caller 
wouldn't know whether a failure occurred before or after the 
kobject_init() call, so it wouldn't know what sort of cleanup action 
was needed: kfree() or device_put().

When that sort of thing happens, the unwinding should be done by the   
code responsible for whole object.  For example, if device_add() fails
then the caller should go on to call device_put() rather than
kfree(dev).
That's how you would expect things to work in most cases.  There aren't
many bare kobjects in the kernel.
I agree that documenting this behavior would be good.
