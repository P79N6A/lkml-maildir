I forgot one thing: remember ubd=mmap? Something like that could have been 
done using MAP_PRIVATE, so that write had still to be called explicitly but 
unchanged data was shared with the host.
Once a page gets dirty but is then cleaned, sharing it back is difficult - but 
even without that good savings could be achievable. That's to explore for the 
very future though.
