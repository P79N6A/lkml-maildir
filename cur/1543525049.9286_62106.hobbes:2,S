Subject: More GFP errors in 2.2.15pre6

This is on a K6-III (pentium clone):
gfp called by non-running (1) task from c011a212!  => do_wp_page+1a
gfp called by non-running (1) task from c011a5fa!  => do_swap_page+e6
gfp called by non-running (1) task from c0121d8a!  => read_swap_cache_async+32
The do_swap_page error occurred 5 times over four hours; the others
occurred once. I was just editing and compiling C++ code in Xemacs
over Gnome/X-Windows (Redhat 6.1 distribution). Note, my code is NFS
mounted so the compilation cycles generated a fair amount of network
activity. The object files are written to local disk so the compiler
is also generating moderated activity on the local e2fs file systems.
