But creating a linux-bug list with this policy:
- The stable kernel series point to this lists
- Annoncement to new kernel point to the normal list
    (the bug to newer kernel are classified 'development')
- Kernel maintainers post to the bug list the 'annonces'
    the of solved bugs
- All discussion about kernel series 0.01, 2.0 and 2.2
    (bug hunting series) should go in this new list
In this manner we:
- have a bug tracking system (a' la Linux)
- We can grep quikly to see if a new bug to an
    old kernel is aready closed.
The new list, IMHO, doesn't duplicate trafic,
but I think it don't reduce much of linux-kernel traffic.
(But provide a quicker references of the know bugs).
