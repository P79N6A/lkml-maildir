So you prefer to corrupt data instead?  I don't think that's a good idea.
Don't do it. Silent failures are really bad.
BUG_ONs are only fatal when you're in interrupt context anyways because
it often ends up trying to kill the idle task. In process context
while there might be some lost locks in most cases the system continues
running happily. 
At some point I had  a hack to just restart idle to handle the 
interrupt case too. Perhaps that might be worth resurrecting if you
want to solve this properly. 
Would be imho far preferable over not having the BUGs imho.
