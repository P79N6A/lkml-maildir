On sparc, setting NR_CPUS to anything other than 32 with CONFIG_SMP set
breaks.  Simple, stupid patch is attached, but there's a more elegant fix to
the actual functions abusing NR_CPUS that just seems much nicer ;-).
And yes, I know, sparc on 2.5 is badly broken, but this just might help keep
the broken-ness down a little bit.
