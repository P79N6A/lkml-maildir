Umm... Andrew's Vaio and my Latitude? :)
Seriously though - one big chunk of the problem is almost certainly that Andrew
and I run with .config's and hardware that differ drastically from what the
various maintainers test against, and the rest is that Andrew pulls git trees
that may or may not be ready for prime time.  Not sure if there's any practical
way to "fix" that without adding so much administrivia overhead to render the
whole -mm tree useless as a a preview/early-warning system....
