this is a bug; fdes is a USERSPACE pointer, you cannot directly access
that from kernel space, you need to use copy_from_user() for that.
And note, what you are doing is unreliable, since the user is capable of
changing that information before you log it in your structure, so if you
want to use the data you log for anything security related or for
something that has to be accurate, it's broken...

that is of course wrong; you free temp and THEN you access it!!
