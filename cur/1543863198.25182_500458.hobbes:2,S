Ok, you won't believe this... I opened my case and rewired my drives... 
And guess what, my second (aka the "good") HDD is now failing! 
I guess, my mainboard has a (but maybe two, or three :( ) "bad" sata-port(s)!  
But, one small question remains: when I opened my case, I saw that my drivers
are pluged in SATA jack 1 and 2... The BIOS also says they're on 1 and 2.
Now, Linux says they're on port 3 & 4! 
it's always ata3.00!
"ata3.00: exception Emask 0x0 SAct 0x0 SErr 0x0 action 0x2 frozen
ata3.00: tag 0 cmd 0xea Emask 0x4 stat 0x40 err 0x0 (timeout)
ata3: soft resetting port
ata3: SATA link up 1.5 Gbps (SStatus 113 SControl 300)
ata3.00: configured for UDMA/133
ata3: EH complete
SCSI device sda: 490234752 512-byte hdwr sectors (251000 MB)
sda: Write Protect is off
sda: Mode Sense: 00 3a 00 00
SCSI device sda: drive cache: write back"
Thanks,
Chr.
