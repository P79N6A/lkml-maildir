Incrementals are usually preferred.  But it's usually more convenient for the
originator to generate a new patch, and I will almost always turn that into
an incremental so that I can review what was changed.  The downside to this
is that nobody else will be able to see what was changed.
So there are pros and cons and I'm not particularly fussed either way,
really.  But if a patch is large and has already had some testing and
review and has been in -mm for a while then that's when wholesale
replacement becomes problematic: it pretty much sets us back to square one.
