I have created a list for discussing issues and announcing test versions
of the skge and sky2 drivers. There are many people with problems and
several vendors are using the hardware as well, therefore I want to be
able to make sure everyone can see the information without having to
be distracted by lkml or netdev mail.

Mailing address is sk-drivers@lists.linux-foundation.org (the list host
server hasn't moved to linux-foundation.org yet).
Don't worry, the changes will still show up one netdev.
