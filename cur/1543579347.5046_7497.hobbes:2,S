	Correct. Select doesn't sleep unless it has to.

	How can you tell when select wakes up the process? What you are seeing has
nothing whatsoever to do with select and simply has to do with the fact that
the kernel does not give the CPU to a process the second that process may
want it.

	Right. The process becomes eligible to run -- it's no longer blocked. The
scheduler then schedules it whenever it feels like it.

	If you have scheduling latency requirements, you MUST communicate them to
the scheduler. If your process had an altered scheduling class, then you
would be right -- it should get the CPU immediately. Otherwise, there's no
reason for the scheduler to give that process the CPU immediately.

	Then tell that to the scheduler.

	This should read "before select returns the process to the list of runnable
processes".
