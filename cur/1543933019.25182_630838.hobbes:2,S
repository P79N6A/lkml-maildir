No-period is a kernel idiom, produces perfectly readable output, I have
never ever heard of anyone expressing the least concern over a lack of dots
at the end of their printks and 91% of kernel code agrees.
otoh the place where no-dots comes horridly unstuck is if a single printk
contains two sentences:
	printk("My computer caught on fire.  I hope yours does too\n");
that's really daft.  It's very rare though.
Of course one could always patch syslogd to add the dots, or change printk
and add an i_am_anal=1 kernel boot option.
Andy, please have an accident with that checkpatch change and let's hope
like hell that nobody starts trying to "fix" any of this.
