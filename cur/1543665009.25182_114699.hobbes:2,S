[NK] If there is no rotating around at all, then it is same as
statically binding the IRQs to cpus. And with the netstat benchmark the
kirq has performed about 10% better than nicely statically bound IRQs.
It is happening like that because, after processing the interrupt the
benchmark
also has to do some processing, and if all the threads are doing the
processing at almost equal speed it gives better performance. If one
thread is faster and another is slower, the slower guy slows down the
whole system.
Thanks,
