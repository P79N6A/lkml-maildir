That is the idea. Unfortunately the ia64 modifications are ia64 wide.
I don't think it should be too hard to make it sn2 only.

No you don't have to. If you have a look at the work in -mm, basically
the whole thing gets recreated on every hoplug operation. It would be
trivial to modify some parameters then reinit the domains in the same
way.
N disjoint domains can be trivially handled by making N passes over
the init code, each using a different set of CPUs as its
"cpu_possible_map". This can easily be done dynamically by using
the above method.

That would be nice. The patch queue is pretty well clogged up at the
moment, so I'm not going to look at the scheduler again until all the
patches from -mm get into 2.6.10-bk.
