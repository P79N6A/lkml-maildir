Please, don't expose major/minor split.  devfs inisisting on separately
passed major/minor is bad enough, no need to compound that crap.
->major and ->first_minor are about to be glued into a single field
anyway and devfs_register() will either switch to dev_t or get wrapper
taking dev_t.
Please, just do dm_disk(dm) and for now use its ->major/->first_minor.
Another thing on cards is the list of block_device over given gendisk -
that kills a bunch of bogus bdget() uses, so the second instance will
disappear completely.
