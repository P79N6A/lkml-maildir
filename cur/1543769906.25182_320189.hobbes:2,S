I'd like to confirm that reverting the following connector related patches
solves the problem for me.
1.patch -> ../full/broken-out/connector-add-a-fork-connector-build-fix.patch
2.patch -> ../full/broken-out/connector-add-a-fork-connector.patch
3.patch -> ../full/broken-out/connector-export-initialization-flag.patch
4.patch -> ../full/broken-out/connector-warning-fixes.patch
5.patch -> ../full/broken-out/connector.patch
Thank you,
	Nick Orlov.
