Looks like Alexandre's patch was damaged by mistake.
An 'extern' appeared in the removed part of lvb_table.h
I guess the patch didn't actually apply to your tree.
This would explain why the lvb_table.h part of the version
you commited to -mm is different.
The attached patch should be good.
Note that dlm_lvb_operations is kept exported in lvb_table.h
so that drivers/dlm/device.c uses it. That was the point of
Alexandre's initial bug report: dlm_lvm_operations was defined
twice when both DLM and DLM_DEVICE are set.
