Absolutely nobody denies that we need a larger dev_t. It's really a poor 
argumentation that you have to come up with this.

Maybe you didn't notice, that only now the block device layer is clean 
enough to go dynamic. Maybe you didn't notice that scsi devices are 
already dynamically numbered and that there are already user space tools 
to translate them to constant device names.

And since more than 8 years Linus is trying to tell you that static 
device numbers don't work. When do you start to listen?
