I do not understand what kind of changes you think are required.
Renaming the functions/structures is not really changing anything and
hostap_crypt.o used to be a separate module (and it should still be
possible to compile it as such by defining HOSTAP_CRYPT_MODULE when
compiling the Host AP code).
It sounds like your changes are just making it more difficult to
maintain generic code because of making it require more work to merge
changes back. With the changes to use crypto API, there's already couple
of different versions of the crypto code for Host AP. I would rather not
bring in more versions. The improvements should go to the wireless-2.6
tree.
As far as I can tell, the version that I submitted couple of days ago
for wireless-2.6 (and potentially linus-2.5) trees, should be usable as
is from other drivers. Yes, hostap module will include some extra
functionality that is not needed, but it does not make it any more
difficult to use the encryption part which should be fully hardware
independent. This can be easily (again) extracted, if it looks like this
code will be used from multiple drivers.

Tied to ioctls?? There is no ioctl processing in the Host AP crypto
code. The header files are mainly for defining the IEEE 802.11 header.
In addition, Host AP code can already be used in the kernel and
externally..

This sounds similar to what the current Host AP driver uses
hostap_80211_{rx,tx}.c.

Yes and this is what has been discussed on netdev and (admittedly,
slowly so far) started with wireless-2.6.

I believe that one needs to first experiment with the features/design
before being able to design a standard API. There has already been quite
many versions of Linux wireless extensions and I would rather first see
what would be a common design that could work with most wireless cards
and then design an API for this. For many functions, we are starting to
have all the needed information to actually to this successfully.

Sure, if there is something that really improves the current situation
in some way. I don't think that just renaming the functions would be
very useful at that point. Of course it can be done, but I would prefer
to see a bit more design on the other parts of the IEEE 802.11 support
and its place in the Linux net stack.
