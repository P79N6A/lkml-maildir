Why is nfsd in the kernel ?
unfsd had some problems, but were they due to its being user-level
or were they just due to its own design ?
It seems that sendfile and other http-oriented optimizations should
make an user-level nfs server perform just fine.
The only problem I can see is the inode-naming (unfsd indeed has a
pretty poor semantics regarding moving files across directories).
Is that unsolvable at user-level ?
How about a tiny bit of help from the kernel ?
