Howdy!!!!
   Its me now. Well the framebuffer project now has its own web site which
I have in my signatrue. You will see on the front page my FB-Driver-HOWTO.
This HOWTO is aimed at the new fbdev API that has been going into the
2.3.X kernel. Now I wrote that driver in October so the new API has
changed somewhat since that time. The doc still gives you something very
close to it. Once the API becomes stable I will rewrite it.
