Hi Paulo,
Just saw you post on LKML as I was browsing around:
> 2 23:53:03 bobi kernel: CPU#0: Temperature above threshold

More likely than not, this is an ACPI issue. I see that you have it
enabled in your 2.6.1 kernel. Do you also have ACPI enabled in your 2.4
kernel? In a more general way, you should look for differences in ACPI
configuration between 2.4 and 2.6.
If there is no difference, I invite you to turn on debugging and
possibly relaxed syntax too. Maybe it'll let you discover something.
Trying 2.6.2 is also an option to consider, since it seems to have many,
many ACPI fixes and improvements.
Hope that helps,
