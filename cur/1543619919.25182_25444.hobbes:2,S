Thanks for this, but whitelist/blacklist is just one aspect of the patchbot, 
and far from the most important aspect.  I think tmda might have a little 
trouble validating a patch against a kernel tree, for example
In Python the white/blacklist handling is trivial anyway.  A workable 
confirmation feature was coded in a couple of hours by the guys (Rasmus and 
Kalle) working on the bot, and it does exactly what we want it to.  Progress 
marches on, Python rocks.  (So do Rasmus and Kalle.)
