ia=interactivity i.e: responsiveness under high load.
smooth=not jumpy i.e: run '# gears & morph3d & reflect &' w/o stutter
fair=non hogging i.e: spreading cpu-load across tasks evenly (top d.1)

The idea here is to expose inefficiencies by driving the system into 
saturation, and although staircase is more efficient than the default 2.6 
scheduler, it is obviously less efficient than spa.

Smoothness control, maybe?

Yes, limiting this could change the semantics for the sake of fairness, it's 
up to you.

No problem.
Thanks!
