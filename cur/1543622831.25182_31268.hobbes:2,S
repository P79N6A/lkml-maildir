Hi,
I finally ported the Tekram DC395 SCSI driver to use pci_map functions.
This means that it potentially work on highmem and 64bit archs.
(Most probably it won't work on big-endian archs, though.)
A few more changes (locking and strtok) have been done to make it work with
2.5 as well. The driver still works under 2.4 kernels as well.
I also found a strangeness (which I suspect to be a chip bug) when DMAing to
disk, when the adapter occasionally fails to count one byte or word (wide)
before a page boundary when the device disconnects.
This is worked around now; though the real fix may be to review
the switching on/off of the SCSI FIFO at the right moments to prevent
counting bytes on the SCSI bus which are not part of the information
transfer.
The code contains lots of ifdefs, part of which are for debugging and part
of which for compatibility with older kernels. Please don't flame me for the
non-aestethic coding, if you dare to look at the code.
The driver still uses old error handling, so expect the driver to break,
when this is thrown out of 2.5.
Get the driver at
 
http://www.garloff.de/kurt/linux/dc395/
or
 
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/garloff/linux/dc395/
The driver is not meant for inclusion into official kernels at this moment,
as a number of users reported problems with the driver; in the worst case
they face data corruption, so be warned. That said, it works for most users.
Please report back success and failures to me.
