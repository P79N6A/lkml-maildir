As I can't get 2.0.36 to compile at the moment (I think I have broken my
tree)
I am trying compiling 2.2.4 with the 2.0.36 ncr* drivers.
The strange thing is that it seems to work for mount(ing) cd-roms and
transferring the data off them, but it resets the bus if I have more
than
one CD-ROM on, and switch between them!
I'll let everyone know how I get on.
(I have put the Yamaha CDRW on the bus, again, works in 'doze, not under
2.2.4)
I want to get this resolved - it's annoying to say the least.
