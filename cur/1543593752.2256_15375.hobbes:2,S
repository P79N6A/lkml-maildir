You do introduce some rounding errors if the measurement isn't in
Celsius or Kelvin.  Ie, you must do a conversion because the hardware
isn't in the desired units.  In this case, the extra precision will be
beneficial.  
If you are going your route, you should send error bars with all the
measurements ;-) Fine, too many decimals leads to a false sense of
security.  However, no one knows the accuracy of any future
temperature sensors so why not accommodate the possibility.  Certainly
some band gap semis can give a pretty good measurement if you have
good coupling.  If the temperature sensor was built into the CPU, you
might actually have accuracy!
