Hello Eric,
Its my first foray into kernel driver programming,
so please don't be too hard on me:)
The total elapsed time (by "time foo") is OK.
The problem is, cputime reported by, for example, "top" 
utility, is wrong. The same problem with fortran intrinsic routine
"ETIME", so quantum chemistry codes i use (all written in fortran) 
reports wrong cputime, but correct "wall(elapsed) time". 
I've attached the code. I was able to test it only on my own dual
Opteron system, so have no idea about other MB.
P.S.
Please include me in CC explicitly! 
Best Regards,
Alexander Shaposhnikov
