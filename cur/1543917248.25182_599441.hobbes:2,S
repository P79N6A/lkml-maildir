Subject: [PATCH -mm] task_struct: move ->fpu_counter and ->oomkilladj
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/27/54

There is nice 2 byte hole after struct task_struct::ioprio field
into which we can put two 1-byte fields: ->fpu_counter and ->oomkilladj.
[cc'ing Arjan just in case ->fpu_counter placement wasn't completely random :^)]
