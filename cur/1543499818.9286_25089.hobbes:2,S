Er.. no.  It's something which I think would be generally useful for
linux even if there never exists a synthetic device filesystem.
The problem it solves is closely related to the problem that ACLs solve:
it allows more than two disjoint groups distinctly different access
permissions to the same files/directories.
It also would just happen to solve the permissions problem introduced
by synthetic filesystems generated by the kernel.  Then again there are
other plausible solutions to this problem (such as something like to a
union FS used to provide permissions).
Anyways: please try and recognize this as an idea in its own right.
Perhaps it's the wrong idea, but I'd kind of like to see it dismissed
[or acknowledged as useful] on merits.
