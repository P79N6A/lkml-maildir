You know that the -ac* VM code was very different from the
VM code that has been submitted recently, right? ;)
The VM code in the -ac* kernels concentrated on things like
deferred swapout, while the real issues like multi-queue VM
weren't present yet.
The newer VM patches leave out the deferred swapout and other
issues, and instead keep all the "low-level" code equivalent
to the old shrink_mmap(), with the only difference being the
way we /select/ which pages undergo the different procedures.
Please take a look at the new VM before saying anything about
it...

Sure, lets get rid of /proc/meminfo ;)
But serious, if /proc/meminfo isn't there to give information
about the internal memory use of the system, why do we have
it? I don't see /proc/meminfo doing anything else than that...

Rik
