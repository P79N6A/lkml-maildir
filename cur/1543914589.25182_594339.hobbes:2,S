Ok, I ran an experiment and I see this failure mode.
So the SETATTR rpc is really a side effect of the client kernel's
behaviour and not an operation directly requested by the user process
on the client.  Is there any reason why that rpc needs to have user2's
creds?  Why not do the rpc with a fake set of creds with uid and gid
set to the uid and gid of the file, in this case user1/allusers ?
That way the rpc will most likely pass the server's permission check.
Greg.
