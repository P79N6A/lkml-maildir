All,
 The AMD pdf says that the memory range is in bits 7-1, though
I believe the current code doesn't honour this.
The fix is as follows:
--- setup.c~	Tue Mar 28 00:39:19 2000
+++ setup.c	Tue Mar 28 00:39:44 2000

 				rdmsr(0xC0000082, l, h);
 				if((l&0x0000FFFF)==0)
 				{		
-					l=(1<<0)|(mbytes/4);
+					l=(1<<0)|((mbytes/4)<<1);
 					save_flags(flags);
 					__cli();
 					__asm__ __volatile__ ("wbinvd": : :"memory");
The same problem exists in 2.2.15pre15 and 2.3.99pre3.
regards,

Dave.
