Thanks for the input... I really do not want to start porting a driver.
Compaq has a NIC which has up to 4 100BT ports or 2 100BT ports and one
1000BT port.
This is 100% compatable with the Intel e1000.o driver on 2.3.x...
If someone could do the port I would be happy to provide the card
and the testing... 
Thanks,  Mike...

NetGear OEM's the Alteon card (so do 3Com), both Alteon and 3Com have
been very good at providing me hardware and docs (well I got those
from Alteon) whereas NetGear never bothered to even reply to emails.
