The only time the lock is released while actively
searching the list is during discovery and direct
ioctl communication. So yes, you are correct, the
can_unload() would have to take both operations
into account. All other list operations take
place completely inside the lock. All in-use
plugins are kept from unloading by module ref
counts. Outside of the scope of the discover and
direct ioctl operations, any unused plugins
should be safe to unload.
Is something being missed?
