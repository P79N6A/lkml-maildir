I don't see why it should be restricted to ia32. The technique can
just as easily be applied to other CPUs.
Why do you say the Sparc people would have fun? Is that "fun, as in
we can do neat tricks with this", or "fun, as in break out the
flamethrowers"?

I've since come to the conclusion that the bloat actually won't be
that significant. If the __init section fits in a page, I won't care.
