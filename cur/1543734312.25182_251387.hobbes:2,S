Yielding processor to the hypervisor allows it to schedule the physical 
processor for execution time on a different logical partition. The 
scheduling in this case is at the hardware/firmware level.

We just happen to allow preemption since we know we're at an upper level 
lock, so we may as well not disable preemption during contention. It 
wouldn't be as straightforward to switch to a blocking lock.
