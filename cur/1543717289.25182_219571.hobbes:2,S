I think this is really an e2fsck/initscript problem.
fsck saw that there were no large files on the fs, then fixed up the
superblock to say that then returned an exit code which says "I modified
the fs".
The initscripts see that exit code and have a heart attack.
What should happen is that fsck returns an exit code which says "I modified
the fs, but everythig is OK".  And the initscripts should say "oh, cool"
and keep booting.
I don't know whether the problem lies with fsck or initscripts.
