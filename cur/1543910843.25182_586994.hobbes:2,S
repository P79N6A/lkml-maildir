Thank you for catching.
Maybe you're correct.
BTW, in PageAnon(page) && PageSwapCache(page) case, I can't find when
.writepage is called. Could you explain ?
In my understanding,
rcu_read_lock()
	-> try_to_unmap()
	-> move_to_new_page()
		-> migrate_page() // swap has .migratepage member.
			-> migrate_page_move_mapping().
			-> migrate_page_copy().
		-> remove_migration_ptes().
At quick glance, above path has no writepage() ops.
just replace swap's radix tree entry.
Thanks,
