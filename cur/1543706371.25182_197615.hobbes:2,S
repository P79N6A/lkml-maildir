May thanks to all who responded: the temperatures indeed needed being
divided by 10, and it looks like lm_sensors 2.8.4 fixed it as shipped:
$ sensors
w83697hf-isa-0290
Adapter: ISA adapter
VCore:     +1.62 V  (min =  +0.06 V, max =  +0.03 V)
+3.3V:     +3.31 V  (min =  +0.14 V, max =  +0.00 V)
+5V:       +5.08 V  (min =  +0.11 V, max =  +0.00 V)
+12V:     +11.92 V  (min =  +1.22 V, max =  +9.73 V)
- -12V:      +1.13 V  (min =  -4.22 V, max =  -4.38 V)
- -5V:       +2.09 V  (min =  -7.71 V, max =  -7.71 V)
V5SB:      +5.62 V  (min =  +5.43 V, max =  +0.27 V)
VBat:      +0.06 V  (min =  +0.03 V, max =  +1.28 V)
fan1:     2721 RPM  (min =   -1 RPM, div = 2)
fan2:        0 RPM  (min = 168750 RPM, div = 2)
temp1: +28°C (high =+40°C, hyst = +12°C) sensor = thermistor
temp2: +34.0°C (high = +120°C, hyst = +120°C) sensor = thermistor
The only thing I am missing now is the RPMs of fan #2 (available in the
BIOS). Any ideas?
Thanks again!
