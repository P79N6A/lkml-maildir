Well, i'm trying to play with git right now to see what would fit 
with how it abstracts things.
I think possibly:
- add the 'signature object' to the respository after the signed
   object
So a 'signed commit' turns into the
- tool preparing the commit object,
 	- get the user to sign it
 	- save the detached signature for later
- adding the commit object to the repository
- prepare the signing object and add to repository
The repository head then refers then to signature object, which could 
(handwaving) look something like:
 	Object		Signature
 	Signing 	<object ID, in this case of the commit object>
 	Sign-type 	GPG
 	<signature data>
Tools should then treat signature objects as 'stand ins' for the 
object they are signing (verify the signature - if desired - and then 
just retrieve the 'Signing' object ID and use that further).
I have no working knowledge of git though, other than following this 
list. So I have no idea whether above is at all appropriate or 
workable.

No more lost than anything else in the git 'fs'.
If someone prunes old objects, they'll lose the signed objects along 
with the signatures. If those files weren't replicated anywhere else, 
well they've just blown away history for good, both the history of 
the source and corresponding signatures.

See above.

Well, it could be retained then.

Possibly.

In CVS it is. If you 'cvs log' a file, you can get a report on which 
revisions of the file belong to which tags (which can be useful 
information sometimes: "ah, so that release had the buggy version" 
type of thing. Or as a sanity check to make sure you got a tag right 
- particularly when you have to move a wrong tag[1]). So, in addition 
to signatures, a general 'referrers of this object' index could be 
useful for reports.
1. This might be just a CVS thing, and not wanted for git -> the 
ability to tag historical revisions and indeed change what tags refer 
to.
