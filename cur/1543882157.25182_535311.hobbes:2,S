That's my impression as well. In particular I think that for this
type of workload it is pretty much irrelevant which scheduler I'm
using :-)

I just finished building cfs and sd against 2.6.21 and will try with
these over the next days.

Right. However the differences w/r to which job finished when, in
particular the change in who "came in" 2. and 3. between sd and cfs
had been consistent with other similar such jobs I ran over the last
couple of days.
In general sd tends to finish all three such jobs at roughly the
same time while cfs clearly "favors" the LTMM-type jobs (which
admittedly involve the least computations). I don't really know
why that is so. However the jobs does some minimal I/O after each
successfully finish run and that might be different w/r to sd and
cfs. Not really knowing what both scheduler do internally I'm in
no position to discuss that with either you or Con :)

I think so too. But then I didn't seriously expect any different.

Correct.
The differences could as well result from small fluctuations in my
work on the machine during the test (like reading mail, editing sources
and similar stuff).

I don't think that's noise. As I wrote above IMO this is the one
difference I personally consider significant. While running I could
watch intermediate output of all 3 jobs intermixed on a console.
With sd the jobs were -within reason- head to head while with cfs
and mainline LTMM quickly got ahead and remained there.
As I speculated above this (IMO real) difference in the way sd and
cfs (and mainline) schedule the jobs might be related to the way
the schedulers react on I/O but I don't know.

Over the weekend I might try to repeat these tests while doing
nothing else on the machine (i.e. no editing or reading mail).

Yes. In fact the workloads used to be run serialized and only
recently I tried to easily have them run on multicore systems.
The whole set of such jobs consists of 312 tasks and thus the
idea is to get a couple of PS3 and have them run there...
(once I found the time to port the software).

There is writing out stats after each run (i.e. every 5-8 sec) both
to the PostgreSQL DB as well as to the console.
I could get rid of the console I/O (i.e. make it conditional) and
for testing purpose could switch off the DB if that would make be
helpful.
Best,
Michael
