Yea,  that's  what  the  comments   in  sched.c  say  as  well. But  I
seriously doubt that. Letting the background process jump pollutes the
caches. That hurts more than letting  the interactive process pass and
keep the background process once asleep  to wait for its home cpu. The
affinity patch seems to be winner here. Didn't try it jet ;)
