Stop whining.
People often complain about Linux lacking a stable kernel driver ABI. 
They act like it's some kind of conspiracy.  The truth of the matter is, 
Linux designers prefer technical flexibility over stable internal 
interfaces.  This is part of Linux philosophy -- it's part of the what 
defines Linux -- and so if you use Linux, this is something you simply 
have to ACCEPT.
If you don't want to accept that, develop for some other OS.  No one's 
begging you to develop commercial products for Linux.
Another important thing to note that whiners like yourself seem to miss 
is that kernel interfaces aren't really any more table in other 
operating systems.  Have you ever developed kernel drivers for different 
versions of Solaris?  Windows?  HPUX?  Tru64?  AIX?  OpenVMS?  Where I 
work, we develop drivers for all of those platforms, and every version 
of every one of those kernels is different from every other version that 
requires us to rewrite and recompile our drivers for each one separately.
So the fact that Linux doesn't have a stable driver ABI is actually one 
of its most mundane and commonplace attributes.
