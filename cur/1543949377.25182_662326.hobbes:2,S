Hi, marcel
Recently, I find my usb bluetooth dongle doesn't work after reboot or resume.
Kernel report (with bluetooth mouse active):
Feb 15 16:54:32 darkstar kernel: hci_acldata_packet: hci0 ACL packet for unknown
 connection handle 43
Feb 15 16:54:34 darkstar last message repeated 124 times
I fixed it by adding HCI_RESET to CSR usb id:
        { USB_DEVICE(0x0a12, 0x0001), .driver_info = HCI_CSR |HCI_RESET},
Maybe you have known that there's other reports about this on
bluetooth list as well.
Most of the ids in hci_usb.c have the HCI_RESET option set.  Does we
need to do this automaticly?  I want to know whether sending reset
request on init in hci_core.c is better, or at least the btusb driver
need these porting.
What's your opinion?
Regards
dave
