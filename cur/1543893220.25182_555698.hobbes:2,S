That is typical daemonize code done by quite a few apps, and even 
described in many unix network programming books. Now say that before that 
you loaded a library that had an internal fd allocated to get some sort of 
services from the kernel (say an epoll fd). What happens when the library 
uses the cached apoll fd after that loop?
