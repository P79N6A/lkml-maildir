Right.
If ssb == m, you can at least unload the ssb module manually, or
specify the right
module to load. In the first patch I sent to you, it was
"!SSB_B43_PCI_BRIDGE" instead of
"(!SSB_B43_PCI_BRIDGE || SSB != y)", but I thought that there is no reason to
completely hide the bcm43xx option if ssb is compiled as module.
