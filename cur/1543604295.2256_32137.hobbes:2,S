So ?
Some hardware miscalculates certain floating point operations,
but we still use FPUs.
Some ethernet cards corrupt the packets, but Linux still supports ethernet.
Some IDE hardrives lock up in DMA mode, yet Linux still supports DMA.
Some softmodems don't work at all, yet Linux still support modems.
There is always buggy hardware in every category. No reason to not use the good ones.
