Squawk.
Not only do I not know whether this stuff should be merged: I don't even
know how to find that out.  Unless I'm prepared to become a full-on
cluster/dlm person, which isn't looking likely.
The usual fallback is to identify all the stakeholders and get them to say
"yes Andrew, this code is cool and we can use it", but I don't think the
clustering teams have sufficent act-togetherness to be able to do that.
Am I correct in believing that this DLM is designed to be used by multiple
clustering products?  If so, which ones, and how far along are they?
Looking at Ted's latest Kernel Summit agenda I see
 Clustering
 	We need to make progress on the kernel integration of things
 	like message passing, membership, DLM etc.
 	We seem to have at least two comparable kernel-side offerings
 	(OpenSSI and RHAT's), as well as a need to hash out how user-space
 	plays into this.
 	(There is now a plan for a Clustering Summit prior to KS - need
 	to validate if this will be useful, still)
So right now I'm inclined to duck any decision making and see what happens
in July.  Does that sounds sane?  Is that Clustering Summit going to happen?
In the meanwhile I can pop this code into -mm so it gets a bit more
compile testing, review and exposure, but that wouldn't signify anything
further.
