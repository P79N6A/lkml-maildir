no, this is a different issue afaics. Eric's patch solves a msi vector leak 
where MSI's were no longer recovered after all 256 of them were handed out. The 
issue here seems to be a very different regression (no vector at all or vector 
not setup correctly to begin with).
I do suggest re-testing the issue with 2.6.20rc7, but it's unlikely it fixes the 
problem for Adam.
The same issue was reported 2/3 days ago by another user basically too (no 
interrupts at all arriving with MSI enabled).
Cheers,
Auke
