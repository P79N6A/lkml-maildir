thanks! that fixed the transmit-timeouts! they happened quite frequently.
the more traffic you'd submit, the more timeouts. e.g. , when viewing
icture over the net (e.g. xv running on a different host), I'd see about
12 timeouts per minute(raw estimation).
any idea what's confusing the chip in the first place?
