Because the sucker tree is purposely driven by real bug reports, not by
developers who happen across a theoretical problem while traversing the
code. If users aren't hitting it today, the fix can wait for 2.6.n+1.

The sucker tree is not a dumping ground for every fix under the sun
(even obvious ones). It's for solving problems hit by real users, right
now.

No. There's an important distinction and the key word is "contain". This
rule specifically forbids patches that do fix a real problem but _also_
contain unrelated trivial changes. See "setup_per_zone_lowmem_reserve()
oops fix" for an example of a patch that could theoretically be rejected 
due to this rule.
