It has been OK over 15x reboots (just tested now).  2.6.16-rc1-mm1 wasn't the 
usual standard award winning release for me because of the reiserfs problems so 
I only booted into it once and ran it for a couple of hours before retreating to 
2.6.15-rc1.
Last *known* problematic release on that box was 2.6.15-mm4.
