Subject: ATAPI DVD Drive looses dma settings on reset, keepsettings=1

Tested with Linux 2.6.15 and 2.6.13.3
I have an ATAPI DVD drive as a master(single) device on my
secondary IDE (hdc).
The normal hdparm settings are:
IO_support   =  1 (32-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  1 (on)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    = 256 (on)
However, if I force a reset with hdparm -w (or the Kernel does
when I insert a disc that the drive takes too long to identify),
DMA gets turned off.  Dmesg reports:
hdc: DMA disabled
hdc: ATAPI reset complete
In the case where inserting a disc causes the reset, dmesg
reports:
hdc: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
hdc: DMA disabled
hdc: ATAPI reset complete
Is there a way I can increate the irq timeout?
It was my understanding that with keepsettings on, the driver
would retain the dma setting on reset.  If there is a way correct
this, or I have mis-understood the purpose of keepsettings,
please CC me the response. 
Thanks.
