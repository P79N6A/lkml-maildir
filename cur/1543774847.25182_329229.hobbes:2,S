Could you please generate the dmesg output from 2.6.12 and 2.6.12-mm2 and,
if there are any relevant-looking differences, send them?
Also, try:
wget 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.12/2.6.12-mm2/broken-out/gregkh-pci-pci-collect-host-bridge-resources-02.patch
patch -R -p1 < gregkh-pci-pci-collect-host-bridge-resources-02.patch
Thanks.
