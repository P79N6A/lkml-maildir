Hi...
This is a non-developer question, but I was wondering if there is anything
in the Linux kernel that would help us prevent SYN floods... I've compiled
SYN_Cookies, and /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies contains a 1. But
yesterday, our syn_recv's started climbing and the system was loggin
Possible syn-flood, sending cookies to the terminal. This didn't stop the
climbing synflood though... 
Is there anything that can be done about this...
Thanks,
