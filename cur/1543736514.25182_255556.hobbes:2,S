I figured out that the slowdown occurs in device_resume(), so I put a printk() 
in dpm_resume(), like this:
--- drivers/base/power/resume.c 2004-09-26 16:44:09.000000000 +0200
+++ drivers/base/power/resume.c.rjw     2004-09-26 16:43:57.000000000 +0200

        while(!list_empty(&dpm_off)) {
                struct list_head * entry = dpm_off.next;
                struct device * dev = to_device(entry);
+               printk("%ld\n",  jiffies/HZ);
                list_del_init(entry);
                if (!dev->power.prev_state)
From it, I have got the following results:

As you can see, the difference between the first and the last timestamp is 22.  
However, if I make the same change in 2.6.9-rc2-mm1, I get:

so the difference between the first and the last timestamp is 1 (ie 22 times 
less).
Now, I have no idea about what may be responsible for such a slowdown, but I 
suspect that it's related to PCI.  I really don't know what to look for, so 
if you can give me any hint, please do.
