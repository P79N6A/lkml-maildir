Sorry, I've since found out that this was actually an issue with the man 
pages (same problem on two different distros).  The man pages were still 
from LinuxThreads, but the NPTL behaviour was different.
Apparently the spec doesn't actually specify the default behaviour, it's 
implementation dependent.
My mistake.
