Yes, it is in a prefetchable BAR.  It's the second half of the second
BAR in:
    0d:00.0 InfiniBand: Mellanox Technologies Unknown device 634a (rev a0)
            Subsystem: Mellanox Technologies Unknown device 634a
            Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 16
            Memory at fc400000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=1M]
            Memory at d8000000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=8M]
            Memory at fc3fe000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=8K]
            Capabilities: <access denied>
but I'm not sure what you mean about combining several cards?
