You're right. What I want really is to be able to bind to a netlink
socket and get told about particular file IO operations I'm interested
in for the /whole/ of a filesystem. The same kind of thing that real

Thanks for the links, Chris. I've not been following Beagle
development (lost interest after the OLS talk got cancelled) very
