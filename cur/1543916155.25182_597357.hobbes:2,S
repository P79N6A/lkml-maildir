OK, had a chance to test it, with Dave Airlie's AGP patch, and here's what it hit:
[  198.925000] list_del corruption. next->prev should be ffff81000118f178, but was ffffffff8067e050
[  198.925000] ------------[ cut here ]------------
[  198.925000] kernel BUG at lib/list_debug.c:72!
[  198.925000] invalid opcode: 0000 [1] PREEMPT SMP 
[  198.925000] last sysfs file: /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/0000:01:00.0/i2c-adapter/i2c-1/i2c-1/dev
[  198.925000] CPU 1

(Yes, I wish I got a backtrace, but that's as long as it lived.  Apparently,
the netconsole stuff actually writing this stuff out was over on CPU0 which then

Some odd SMP-related race? (x86_64 kernel on a Core2 Duo T7200, if it matters)
