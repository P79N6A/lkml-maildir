it's not integrating.
It's reviewing and passing on for merge ;)
fundamental difference. You don't "own" the driver in the tree. You just
keep it nice and shiny and clean. Best done by blessing patches, and by
developing in "patches" not "new codebase". The entire "new codebase"
thinking is the problem with CVS-think. Think in patches (once merged),
not in code/tree.
