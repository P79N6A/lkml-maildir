Yes, that is what I thought.  The question was more directed at the
list.  I added netdev to the cc:.  
I looked at Robert Love's book and I am still unclear on the use of
do_softirq above.  To reiterate the question:  why does netif_rx_ni have
to manually flush any pending softirqs on the current proccessor after
doing the rx?  Is this just a performance hack?
