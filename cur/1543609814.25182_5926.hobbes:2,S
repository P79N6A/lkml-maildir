My reading of the standards is:
[EFBIG] - File too large. You get this when trying to write. Not for a seek.
  The size of a file would exceed the maximum file size
  of an implementation or offset maximum established
  in the corresponding file description.
[EOVERFLOW] - Value too large for data type. This can happen for a seek.
  The resulting file offset would be a value which cannot be represented
  correctly in an object of the given type.
[EINVAL] - Bad value for other reasons. This will happen for a seek to a
  negative offset.
