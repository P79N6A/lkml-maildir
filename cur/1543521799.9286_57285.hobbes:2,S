Alexander:
Thanks for this little discussion.  It turns out that the inode does not really give
me what I want anyway.  What I want is for my driver to allocate instance structures
keyed to the major/minor of the device (character driver).  I notice that if I do
mknode deva c 100 1; mknode devb c 100 1 that deva and devb get unique inode
numbers.  I assume that if a program opened deva and devb that the driver's open
routine would see two distinct inode structures.  In that case I still want just one
instance structure pointed to by both files.
Conclusion:  I will use the file->private_data and resolve the uniqueness at file
open time.
I had overlooked this fine point for quite some time (years), and our little
discussion has cleared it up for me.
Thanks,
Dave
