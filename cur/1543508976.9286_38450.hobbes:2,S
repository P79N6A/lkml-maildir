Subject: [PATCH] ntohl/htonl prototype in kernel headers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi!
As glibc prototypes ntohl/htonl as returning uint32_t and taking the same
argument while the kernel declares them still as returning/taking unsigned
long, once cannot mix e.g. netinet/in.h and linux/capability.h (the latter
indirectly sources in linux/byteorder/generic.h) which is bad.
The following patch makes the kernel ntohl/htonl work on __u32 and declares
the same prototype for userland with glibc 2.0+. For libc5 it keeps the
commonly used definition.
Are there any objections?
This patch should apply cleanly against linux 2.2.12 and 2.3.18.
BTW: Solaris 7 declares ntohl/htonl as 32bit, while Irix 6.5 declares it to
unsigned long, so apparently other Unices don't agree on it either.
