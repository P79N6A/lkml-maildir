that's basically the one, just slightly modified to loop through a list 
addresses instead of the single address. It's a negligible performance 
gain, but simplified some other code I was testing.
The point is that some small set of operations may need to be atomic and 
or executed in a critical time period. Allowing these portions of code 
to be preempted opens the door for unexpected failure cases.
A 'perfect' driver would of course still be able to recover (or at least 
guarantee it wouldn't crash). Sometimes the timing issues aren't known 
or explictly stated, so the driver has 'never failed that way before' 
because it hasn't been tested that way.

some kind of timecritical_lock() is a possibility. It would seem that 
such a construct would coexist with SMP and RTLinux. I guess I'm just a 
pessimist in that I expect that having not an explicit lock on time 
critical sections will eventually mean that something will invalidate 
the timing.
