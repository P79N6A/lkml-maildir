You just violated another convention which is never to repost
publically what has been mailed to you privately.

No, you are composing new messages which quote part of an old message.
By not quoting all of it you are not deleting anything, merely 'not-
copying' part of the email to which you are replying.  Of course you
would still need to keep the full text of the mail to which you are
replying lying around.

But you have much more experience with the US courts than I have, and
I thank my lucky stars for that.  So if they really are as stupid as
you say, and keeping the whole text of the message to which you are
replying in a different message in the same folder isn't enough then
I guess you will have to continue to quote in that crazy way.
