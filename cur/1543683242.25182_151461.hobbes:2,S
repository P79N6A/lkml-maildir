Greetings!
I'm running 2.6.0-test1 on an SiS based laptop with all the PCMCIA 
network and serial drivers built into the kernel.  When the system boots 
with a PCMCIA cardbus card in place, the card doesn't show up.  I unplug 
the card and plug it back in, and then the kernel "sees" it and it 
works.  If I unplug it again, I have to go through a plug - unplug - 
plug cycle before it recognizes it.  As if it only recognizes the card 
on even numbered insertion events.
My modem card is not a cardbus card (no gold colored strip on the top) 
and it exhibits the same plug - unplug - plug requirement.  If it's in 
the slot when the computer boots, however, it will get set up, because 
the pcmcia-cs cardmgr sets it up via the sysinit scripts.
Any thoughts on why these cards require more than one insertion before 
they're recognized?  Bug / feature?
Thanks,
Chris
