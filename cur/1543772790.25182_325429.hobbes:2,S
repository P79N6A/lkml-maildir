Thanks a lot wli.
Sorry, I dont have that machine where i reproduced
this problem. Stack trace (in my first mail) is the
only info that I have with me. There is no other
application running on the system which uses
remap_file_pages (non-linear vma)
Coming to my original question. when I do
mmap(MAP_LOCKED) VM_LOCKED gets set for the vma.
who sets VM_RESERVED, does this flag has to do
anything when VM_LOCKED is already set ?
   do {
 list_for_each_entry(vma, &mapping->i_mmap_nonlinear,
                                                
shared.vm_set.list) {
     if (vma->vm_flags & (VM_LOCKED|VM_RESERVED))
              continue;
    cursor = (unsigned long) vma->vm_private_data;
while (vma->vm_mm->rss &&
cursor < max_nl_cursor &&                             
   cursor < vma->vm_end - vma->vm_start) {
                                
try_to_unmap_cluster(cursor, &mapcount, vma);
        cursor += CLUSTER_SIZE;
}
.....<snip>
   } while (max_nl_cursor <= max_nl_size);
