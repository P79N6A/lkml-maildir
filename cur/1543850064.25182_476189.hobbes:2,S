Here is the output of /proc/interrupts
I found some interrupt-count in IRQ 3.
but if I do the ping command, the IRQ 3 interrupt-count
is not incremented.
I tried several 16bit-pcmcia network card.
 (1)Asix 100Mbps   PCMCIA Network card => does not work
 (2)DL10019 100Mpbs PCMCIA Network card => does not work
 (3)NE2000-based 10Mbps PCMCIA Network card => works properly.
