Subject: [PATCH 2.4.20-pre8] irtty MODEM_BITS additional fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

	Hi Marcelo,
	Alan did fix the compile of the irtty driver for i386 in
pre8. Unfortunately, there is still many platforms which doesn't
compile, including some that I know where IrDA is heavily used (PPC,
ARM).
	This patch make sure the code works on all platforms. It's
2.4.X, so I guess the code *must* work.
	Regards,
	Jean
P.S. : Russel : this is an opportunity to fix the ARM platform
difference in the proper way. I guess irtty is still used on some ARM
platforms (especially with serial dongles).
