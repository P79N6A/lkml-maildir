I'm not sure what the original problem is with alpha, but I added this
call to remove the hard coding of irq numbers in various drivers that
"find" the chip in legacy mode. Instead, I give the arch the opportunity
to provide the actual irq numbers in that case.
IRQs on IDE in legacy mode is sort of an out-of-spec piece of junk that
was invented to make PCI based peecees "look like" good old rotten
hardware, unfortunately, some modern and non-x86 HW vendors still don't
haev a clue and configure (wire in some case) their on board IDE in
legacy mode, but with IRQs that, on those archs, aren't 14 and 15. That
hook fixes the problem on some ppc64 machines but should be extended to
cover various other cases where similar shit happens.
It's in PCI because I figured it was as bad there than anywhere else. In
this case, it's the IDE layer asking the PCI layer "hey, that guy
doesn't respect the normal PCI IRQ mapping, can you tell me how it's
routed ?" :) Back then, I didn't know of a header shared between ide and
libata so I put it there.
Ben.
