Your lguest readme is quite lacking in the area of how to configure a
guest kernel as opposed to the host kernel. More hand-holding, please.
Maybe it's obvious once I've actually applied the patch and run
menuconfig, but I'm loathe to attempt anything that isn't a cake walk
at my current loadavg, especially given the fits of blind rage trying
to do anything nontrivial with Xen tends to provoke in me.
