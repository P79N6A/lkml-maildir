Actually, currently we return EXDEV on all cross directory hardlinks,
and there have not been many programs that care. A program should expect
this as it is always possible that the destination directory is located
in another filesystem.
When we would allow links within the same Coda-volume, we will ofcourse
use Peter's policy suggestion as it does fit closely with Coda's
permission model which is based on directory ACLs. But we will still be
returning EXDEV whenever someone tries to link a file into a directory
located on a different volume, as that volume could be located on
different servers.
I would prefer to see applications handle the error correctly. This is
actually one of the normal errors to expect when calling link(2) in the
first place.
