Sounds reasonable to be weary of patches like that...

Well...

The code in lookup gets called frequently enough that I'm not sure. Whenever
one touches a file on a read-only branch, a copyup is done. This may have to
recreate the directory hierarchy leading up to the file - since the VFS
doesn't have such code, unionfs builds up a stack of all the path
components, and then it pops them off one at a time calling vfs_mkdir for
each. The stack creation is where we do this "reallocation."
