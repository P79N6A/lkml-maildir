right, i just wanted to avoid doing that from the process that polls itself,
because a std::cout << "ugh!" << std::endl; might already be enough to skew
the following irq's, right?
anyways, this new version [just upped] prints a line when a missed irq was
detected. Also this version understands a third parameter which acts as an
upper threshold. A line is printed when the difference of the cycle count of
two consecutive wakeups is greater than the threshold.
run it once w/o threshold on an idle system to see what a useful thresh
would be.
i use it like this for example:
./rt_wakeup 1024 50000 1200000
What's the best way to find out the cycles/s of the cpu? This way the
input/output could become a little nicer [because then i can calculate
programatically how long a "perfect" period should be in cycles].
