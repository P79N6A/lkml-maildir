Sounds like something booting to Safe Mode Command Prompt Only would fix, 
as opposed to booting to plain command prompt mode
command prompt mode will load some drivers (such as himem), better not to 
load them when using LOADLIN. Safe Mode Command Prompt Only boots 
straight to the command prompt, very similar to setting init to /bin/sh 
for a completely bare single-user mode.
