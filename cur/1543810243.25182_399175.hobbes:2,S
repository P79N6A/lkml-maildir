The only thing that is said will be used by uswsusp that isn't already
in the kernel in lzf.  md5 is there twice, crypto is there.  lzf it
seems belongs in cryptoloop too according to some of the reactions.

You missed all the messages of people who would like it in cryptoloop
for compressed filesystems?  Part of the problem it seems with Nigel's
code is that it is stamped "suspend2", and nobody looks for useful
code in there.

It hasn't worked for me reliably on any of the dell laptops we have
around.  Driver problem, irq problem, who knows.  Pavel would sure
like to have these problems fixed, no doubt about that, but uswsusp
has nothing to do with fixing them.  The entire point of uswsusp is to
have progress bars, compression and encryption.  It has _nothing_ to
do with the reliability of suspend itself.
Suspend2 already has the progress bars and stuff.  Hence the "already
done and working".

That does not answer the question.  If there are no problems with
swsusp, there is no need for either suspend2 or uswsusp.

Pavel is the swsusp maintainer.  Pavel is the one defining the
interfaces drivers have to conform to to play ball.  Quality and
documentation of these interfaces is what makes the difference when
you have to use them in the drivers.
At that point, with the last clash with Linus, I don't really know
what has to be done with IRQs in particular.

Duplicating what?  There are multiple implementations, some in
suspend2, some in libraries.  The suspend2 ones, as kernel routines,
are designed to work in a constrained environment, fs, network and
memory-wise.  The library ones aren't.  Uswsusp needs code that works
in a constrained environment.  So the technically clueful way is to
start from the libraries?

For some people, like you, swsusp works as-is.  Good.  For some more
people, swsusp doesn't work reliably, while suspend2 does.  So there
are some things in suspend2 that are better than the current
implementation.  I see zero effort to find out what these things are

Am I?  I have _zero_ authority over who maintains what, you know.  I
know that, Pavel knows that, Rafael knows that.  And I never said
Pavel or Rafael were not competent, quite the contrary.  I'm just
casting some doubt on their current methods.  I don't like seeing
anymore throwing of the baby with the bathwater going on than strictly
necessary.

Obviously not.  I think networking belongs to the kernel, and moving
things to userspace because it somehow magically makes maintenance
easier is complete bullshit.  I have criteria to decide what should be
in the kernel and what should be in userspace, and networking squarely
belongs in kernelspace.
  OG.
