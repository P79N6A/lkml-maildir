Confirmed, I had to put a horrendously ugly hack into my threaded web
server to work around this.
All the userspace code appears correct;  basically, libresolv (glibc 2.1)
checks the UDP socket with poll(), which indicates data is waiting; it
then calls some variant of recv(), which blocks indefinitely.  I've only
ever been able to re-produce it under heavy load, which leads me to wildly
speculate it's a race condition in the UDP code somewhere.  (Wow, Adam,
that's really helpful.)  I'll try to reproduce the problem tonight on my
laptop and provide more precise information... (sure wish I could ptrace a
linuxthreads program...)
