Subject: Accessing a process structure in the processes link list

Would it be possible for a program running as root
that wasn't compiled with the kernel to access a
process structure in the processes link list? 
I've read an article about hiding processes and the
article made sound so easy to access the link list and
hide a process, how easy is it? 
Is it possible to a process to access its own entry in
the processes link list?
Thanks, 
Ali
