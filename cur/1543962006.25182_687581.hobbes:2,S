the important question is: exactly what gcc are you using? (and if you use a distro gcc,
which distro)
second question would be, what does the following command give?
echo "int foo(void) { char X[200]; return 3; }" | $1 -S -xc -c -O0 -mcmodel=kernel -fstack-protector - -o -
(this is the command from scripts/gcc-x86_64-has-stack-protector.sh that the kernel uses to test at compiletime
  if you have stack protector support)
