As a data point, I've had my kernels using a 32k buffer for four years
and I never retooled anything to know about that change... syslog and
dmesg still dump every line of it.
as for 20k... IO-APIC messages, SCSI controller messages, etc.  Alot can be
said before sysklog gets a chance to see any of it.

PS: I thought the current kernels (2.3) had a 16k buffer?
