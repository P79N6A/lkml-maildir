No, you are right. I misread it as generic ps2 protocol.
A complete different problem that might be a problem is that even though
the master(pad) says it has passthough capabilities, there might not be
any guest attached. The bit only tells that it is capable of handling one.
I asked synaptics about this some time ago and they replyed that the only
way to find out is to send a byte and look for a returnbyte or a timeout.
