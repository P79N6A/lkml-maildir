Nothing is bad there, except your diagnostic, in my opinion.
We just succeed 2 PAGES allocations mostly each time, but we want to
succeed such a allocation most of the time. ;)
Relying on 2 PAGES allocations _is_ broken. You can invent any prothesis
you want, a single butterfly that does not behave as you believe all
bufferflies should behave can defeat it, in my opinion that is not going
to change on this topic.
If the mess-up (i.e. enthropie) gets to high, you have every chance to get
defeated regardless the heuristic you implement, in my opinion.  Lots of
things, including user-land applications may have patterns that will
increase the enthropie. Even an apparently kind change in the kernel may
have the offending effect to increase the mess-up. 
If you want 2 PAGES allocations to succeed, pool such objects and wait for
availability each time nothing is available (hopefully, it will not last
too long :-) ). For the kernel stack, such a pool will probably work quite 
bad.
Btw, I donnot want to rely on 2 PAGES allocations having to succeed most
of the time.

If you lose one arm and you replace it by one of your legs, you probably 
will not be quite happy of the result. :)
Better to do nothing than to do things that makes things worse, IMO.
The only smart allocation pattern we must rely on is to only require 1 
PAGE allocation to succeed.
There is another smart allocation pattern that consists in allocating
nothing. ;-)
I donnot know any other allocation pattern that looks smart to me.
