Fedora with their 2.6.12 and raid+xfs+nfs still causes occasional 
problems for me. Haven't tried their 2.6.14. But until the block layer 
modifications are mainline I'm sticking with 8 KiB. My heart momentarily 
stops every time the file server decides to have a kernel panic, so 
better safe than sorry.
