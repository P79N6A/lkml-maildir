The RealTek 8110S chip is distributed on many x86_64 mobos,
and the current in-kernel version of the r8169 driver does
not appear to work.  I have adapted this driver from the
official realtek 2.4 driver at:
ftp://210.51.181.211/cn/nic/rtl8169rtl8169sbrtl8110sb/linux2.4.x-8169s
(160)0915.zip
The patch for the 2.6 kernel is located here:
http://dev.gentoo.org/~brad_mssw/kernel_patches/2.6.0/2.6.0-test9-r8169-8110S.patch
This has been tested extensively on x86_64. The only quirk
found is that it seems to require ACPI to work, but it seems
as though x86_64 has this requirement all-around to be
fully-functional.
Please CC me on any replies!
