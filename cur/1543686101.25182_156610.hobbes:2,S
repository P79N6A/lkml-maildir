kernelnewbies.org (web, email, wiki, or irc) would be a good place
for such documentation....

This (below) is all very x86 specific.
It helps (probably an understatement) to know how stacks grow,
how compilers generate code, how registers are used, etc.

Some code tried to reference address 0.  There is nothing mapped
at address 0 on purpose, to catch errant code such as this.

EIP is the (Extended) Instruction Pointer register, aka the next
instruction pointer.  It points just beyond the current (faulting)
instruction.

This value is the page fault error code: (from source code):
 * error_code:
 *	bit 0 == 0 means no page found, 1 means protection fault
 *	bit 1 == 0 means read, 1 means write
 *	bit 2 == 0 means kernel, 1 means user-mode

0010 is the CS register value (Code segment selector).

These are the other i386 segment/selector registers.

Kernel stack, beginning at top of stack.

show_trace() tries to pick out kernel text addresses from the stack
and only print those addresses.  Running this thru ksymoops
with a matching System.map file will decode these addresses into
kernel function names.

That was fairly straightforward.  Did it help any?
