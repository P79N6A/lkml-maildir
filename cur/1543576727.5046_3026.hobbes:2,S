BTW..
The current 2.4 struct page could be already shortened a lot, saving a lot
of cache.
(first number for 32bit, second for 64bit) 
- Do not compile virtual in when the kernel does not support highmem
(saves 4/8 bytes) 
- Instead of having a zone pointer mask use a 8 or 16 byte index into a 
zone table. On a modern CPU it is much cheaper to do the and/shifts than
to do even a single cache miss during page aging. On a lot of systems 
that zone index could be hardcoded to 0 anyways, giving better code.
- Instead of using 4/8 bytes for the age use only 16bit (FreeBSD which
has the same swapping algorithm even only uses 8bit) 
- Remove the waitqueue debugging (obvious @)
- flags can be __u32 on 64bit hosts, sharing 64bit with something that
is tolerant to async updates (e.g. the zone table index or the index) 
- index could be probably u32 instead of unsigned long, saving 4 bytes
on i386
Would you consider patches for any of these points?
