The reason it is worded that way is so that we avoid the situation where
one guy is doing the work on $SCM and the other guy is sitting there 
running BK commands in order to reverse engineer BK.
We aren't going to come make a fuss if you are using BK and some other
guy is tinkering with CVS, we're not unreasonable people.  On the other
hand, that doesn't give you carte blanche, if your officemate or friend
is working on a BK replacement and you are helping him, yes, we will 
likely make a fuss.
