This VIA chipset is the bridge over which the bugs run. Blaming on it
for the problem you've hit would be similar to blaming the USB host
controller driver for a bug that is in the USB keyboard or mouse driver.
The "other I2C drivers" don't run frequently at all now that you've
disabled i2c-viapro. Without an I2C bus to probe on the machine, these
drivers don't do anything.
So, again, if you are still willing to help me solve the problem,
please boot the bad kernel and run:
$ ls -l /sys/bus/i2c/devices/*/driver
Then we'll know which drivers attached to I2C devices on your SMBus.
Figuring out which one shouldn't have will likely be straightforward.
Thanks,
