Arjan, I didn't want to needlessly couple megaraid and megaraid_sas.
Since they are in the same directory, I couldn't avoid having single
Makefile. I thought at least these two should be separate to be consistent
with their independent nature.
If this is not a good enough reason, I will merge these two files.
Thanks,
Sreenivas
