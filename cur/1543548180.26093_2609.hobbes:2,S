Nope, you are false... There is a kernel debugger, i did test drive it
for a few nice things. Its called PrivateICE or short pICE. It was
availabel via a website which URL i have not yet handy and it
truely does source and assembler debugging of kernel modules now.
Unfortunately AFAIK its not stable until Monday and its source
is not yet published - but in fact there _is_ such a promising project.
Bye, AlexS.
