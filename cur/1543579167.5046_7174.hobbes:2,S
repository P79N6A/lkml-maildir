Make sure your system is free of dust...dust can cause small errors like
this to occur. Also make sure that the temperature of the system is within
tolerable levels. Also, a capacitor on your motherboard could be
failing...there are many different things that could cause this error.

Probably not. The errors were there before yo upgraded the kernel; they
just weren't reported. Those messages are merely letting you know that an
APIC retry happened. The message still got to the controller; it just had
to get sent twice.
good luck,
