There's another issue.  The real root device might not be known
at the time the initrd is first loaded.
This is the case in some installers, which seem to use pivot_root
after the installer is done so the user doesn't need to reboot
after the install is done...
Of course, the real root device won't be known until after the user
has done the partitioning of the hard disk(s).

Rik
