Yes. Those are *YOUR* config setup parameters, that happen to work with *your*
specific configuration when everything is operational. Some problems:
1) Not all the world uses initrd....
2) I hope your /script/mount_root will Do The Right Thing if the mount fails
because it needs an fsck, for example.  Answering those 'y' and 'n' prompts can
be a problem if your keyboard isn't working yet..
3) Bonus points if you can explain how to, *without* a working keyboard,  modify
that /linuxrc on your initrd to deal with the situation where your keyboard
setup is wrong (think "booting with borrowed keyboard because your usual one
just suffered a carbonated caffeine overdose")...
There's a *BASIC* bootstrapping problem here - if you move "initialize and
handle the keyboard" into userspace, you then *require* that a significantly
larger chunk of userspace be operational in order to be able to even type at
the machine.  If you're trying to recover a *broken* userspace, it gets a lot
harder.
And the embedded people who use "init=/onlyprogramthateverruns" are going
to have a significant collective cow about this....
