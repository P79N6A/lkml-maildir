 Dear Friend, 
I Dr.Morgan Jones, President ROYAL Import and 
Exportcompany based in Europe. My company exports cocoa and other 
goods/services for world trade. 
Presently we are searching for 
representatives in America and Canada to help in establishing a medium 
of a quick transaction with our foreign customers in Canada and America 
as well as receiving payment from our clients on our behalf.

receiving the Cheque payment or Wire Transfer to your account as our 
representative for the cost of purchasing in your account will ease our 
transaction and a quick turn over.

your assistance to stand as our representative in your country.You can

On every 
remittance or cheque clearance made in your care as our representative, 
10% should be a balance in your account as your commission and 90% 
should be wired to any of our future account or supplier to be given to 
you. 
Please, if you can honestly assist us in this arrangement I will 
be so glad to build up a life time contact with you overseas . 
More
