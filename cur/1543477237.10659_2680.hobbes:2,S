Poor scaling of poll/select semantics is a well known problem. You are doing
setups for the waiting each time anyone returns. Note its possible to write
a select_begin() select_do() select_end() syscall set to keep poll like semantics
but scale more

Its an example of why poll has problems. Sun have been doing a lot of work
on poll/select scaling.

Im not sure. I don't think his signal ones are completely right, but it
is true that for pthreads and the I/O stuff you may ultimately want a
"queue async I/O and dont make threads for it" and certainly the ability
to do CLONE_SHARE_SIGNALS for POSIX style pthreads would be good - Im sure
Ulrich would have a chunk to say on this and the Linuxthreads hackers.
My primarily contention is with the scale of problem he portrays rather than
the actual points he identifies. 
He does not however seem to me to be an idiot.
