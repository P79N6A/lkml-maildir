1)
In order to make it link I had to change the following in rules.make:
 # If the list of objects to link is empty, just create an empty O_TARGET
 cmd_link_o_target = $(if $(strip $(obj-y)),\
-                     $(LD) $(LDFLAGS) $(EXTRA_LDFLAGS) -r -o $@ $(filter $(obj-y), $^),\
+                     $(LD) $(LDFLAGS) $(EXTRA_LDFLAGS) -r -o $@ $(filter-out FORCE,$(obj-y)),\
                      rm -f $@; $(AR) rcs $@)
Otherwise no objects were on the commandline because make strips ./
2)
Top-level Makefile still uses make -C therefore apths are relative to first
subdirectory as seen here:
  CC      udf/balloc.o
  CC      udf/dir.o
  CC      udf/file.o
  CC      udf/ialloc.o
3) acpi failed to compile due to  -Idrivers/acpi/include, but current
directory is drivers.
