Sorry, this has been on my "things to look at" list for a while, but I
haven't gotten a chance to really understand where things are yet.
In general, this MMU notifier stuff will only be useful to a subset of
InfiniBand/RDMA hardware.  Some adapters are smart enough to handle
changing the IO virtual -> bus/physical mapping on the fly, but some
aren't.  For the dumb adapters, I think the current ib_umem_get() is
pretty close to as good as we can get: we have to keep the physical
pages pinned for as long as the adapter is allowed to DMA into the
memory region.
For the smart adapters, we just need a chance to change the adapter's
page table when the kernel/CPU's mapping changes, and naively, this
stuff looks like it would work.
Andrew, does that help?
