Rest assured I wasn't interested in pushing this patch for mainline anyway.
-ck users can also rest assured about this patch for the following reasons:
- The usage pattern on a desktop will guarantee that this patch helps 99.9% 
of the time rather than hurts. Therefore, this feature is enabled by default 
on -ck.
- With the usage pattern on a server of any sort, it will be unknown whether 
this patch helps or harms. Therefore, this feature is disabled by default on 
-cks.
