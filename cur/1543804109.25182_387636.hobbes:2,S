Just for others' info - the fill_super change has been tested in the past
by Sonny Rao at IBM also.  e2fsprogs has supported this for a long time
already.

The code doesn't get any more clear with your change.  Using "sectors" as
a readahead unit is kind of pointless in the first place (that isn't your
fault, not sure why it is like that), and 8kB readahead is probably too
small for today's disks.
It would probably make more sense to just change this to be straight forward:
"readcnt = 16 * sb->s_blocksize" or "readcnt = 64 >> EXT3_BLOCK_SIZE_BITS(sb)".
Usually directories are small, so this is a non-issue.  If they are large
you likely want to readahead more anyways, especially since directory blocks
are usually fragmented and more readahead time is better.
Note that this should probably also include an ext2 version of the same
change so that it is still possible to mount such a filesystem as ext2.
Cheers, Andreas
