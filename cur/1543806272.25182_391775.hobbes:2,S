You didn't say which kernel, but it looks like you didn't do a make
clean/mrproper before trying to build just an i386 kernel? Did you
build an x86_64 kernel at some point from the same tree?
I think that include/asm is pointing to asm-x86_64, which, if you
removed it, is why the compiler can't find said file.
Thanks,
Nish
