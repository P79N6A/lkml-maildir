Hi.
I have recently begun to try and use suspend to ram more, and have an 
intermittent problem. Actually, it's a couple of (possibly related) problems, 
but I'll start with the one that's easiest.
Sometimes, when I resume, the keyboard stops responding. I then need to hold 
down the power button for 4 seconds. At the next boot, things are still not 
right. The i8042 controller seems to be confused about it's mode, because I 
get the following differences in dmesg to a 'normal' boot:
--- good-boot-dmesg-no-timestamp.txt	2007-06-22 15:54:03.000000000 +1000
+++ problem-boot-dmesg-no-timestamp.txt	2007-06-22 15:54:18.000000000 +1000

I've been able to log in remotely after suspending to ram, and see the "failed 
to resume active multiplexor" message in dmesg at that stage. Dmitry (or 
others), is this a known issue? I'm more than happy to probe further if not.
In case it's relevant, the other issue is that sometimes the hard drive stays 
on constantly and the system becomes unresponsive. The controller is an 
ALI15X3. I'm using the old drivers.
