Subject: 2.6 noisy boot messages from gen_probe.c

I get this stuff at bootup, and I do not see why it should
interest me. Normally one wants to see only detected devices
and not failed probes. I did not enable any debug option
in the kernel.
It seems to come from
	mtd/chips/gen_probe.c
I do have
	CONFIG_MTD_ICHXROM=m
because I build all modules. So, should these printk's really
be KERN_WARNING or should they be removed?
