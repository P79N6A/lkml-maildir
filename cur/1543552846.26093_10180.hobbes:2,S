I don't believe that v1.09 (as in Red Hat Linux 7) has this problem, but
does have fixes over-and-above 1.07 (particularly, 1.07 and v1.08 touch
user-space inappropriately, 1.09 fixes).  If PeterJ can't get to it before
2.2.18final, Alan, would you consider putting in the v1.09 driver?
Thanks,
Matt
