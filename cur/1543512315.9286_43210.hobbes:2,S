The behavior of Horst von Brand (specifically, outright ignoring that his 
thread started *because* of USB dynamic devices and instead repeatedly 
asserting that nobody needs dynamic devices)  hasn't done anything for the 
anti-devfs side.
The pissing match is going on on both sides.  Ignore the pissers and get on 
with the technical details already.  Making technical decisions based on the 
behavior of a few idiots ("there is no cause so good that one cannot find an 
idiot championing it" or something like that --- which applies to both sides 
of this discussion) is an even worse idea.
