Oh, yeah, great, another hand-rolled build system. That's *juwt* what
those of us who have autotools working well (with config.site's that
do all we need and then some) are looking forward to.
There are advantages to standardization, you know. A *lot* of
autobuilders know how to make autoconf-generated configure scripts jump
through hoops. I was downright *happy* when util-linux was
autoconfiscated: I could ditch the code to handle automatic
configuration of yet another one-package hand-rolled build system.
