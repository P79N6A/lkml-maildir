Meanwhile I found out that if I eject the CD by pressing button, it
resumes its work and reports error to the user process.

It worked in earlier 2.4 kernels (2.4.18?) with DMA - I don't remember

such computers here (Intel D816EEA2 mainboard, this specific Sony CDrom)
and they all behave the same.
