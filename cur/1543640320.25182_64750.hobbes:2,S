I've seen scientific reports of scalability that good in non-shared memory
computers (mostly in transputer arrays) where (with a scalable algorithm)
unless you got >90% you were doing something wrong.  However, if you insist on
sharing main memory, I still don't believe you can get anywhere near that...
IMO 30% is doing very well once past the first few CPUs.
