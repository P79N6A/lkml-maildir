Of course stats will help here but to understood problem you do not need
them. clone() works 3usecs, switch is 1usec (roughly). So any application
with gobs of thread-creation will suffer (for example any application
where new thread is created for new incoming packet). Thread creation will
be 6usecs insteads of 3usecs (3usecs to create thread, 1usec to switch
back to new thread, 1usec to switch back to creator and 1usec to switch
back to working thread) and the only benefit is some 20-40 bytes of
"bloat" removed from linux kernel ...
Of course you still need CLONE_PPID/CLONE_PPIDOK/PF_PPIDOK to eliminate
switch to "manager thread" altogether...
