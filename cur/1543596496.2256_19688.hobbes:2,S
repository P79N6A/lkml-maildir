The easy way to handle this is to md5 checksum the disks at boot.
Read the first and last track of the first and last cylinder of
every BIOS drive. Then match up the disks when partition tables
get scanned.
The hard way involves running the BIOS in virtual-8088 mode to
trap IO accesses, then mapping to drivers by IO region later.
Neither way is 100% reliable, but the current guess is worse.
