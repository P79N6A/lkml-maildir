How many of you have worked for IBM before?  Vowels are not evil. ;)
Grouping four or more consonants to name anything will cause similar
expressions on people's faces.  Numbers don't help much either.
Ext2 is a great name, because "ext" actually is a pronouncable syllable.
MinixFS, ChunkFS, TileFS are great too.  XFS and JFS are ok, at least
they only have three consonants.  But FFS exists, so I'd rather go for a
syllable.
