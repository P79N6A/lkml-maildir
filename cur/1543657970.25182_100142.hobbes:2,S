Attacked by (mostly) a bunch of wankers who don't seem to do much
useful themselves.  People who do useful work once in a while know
how much effort you are putting into Linux drivers and appreciate
the work you're doing.

That's a real shame.  I like your business model of recovering the
development costs before releasing the software since it's a way
to fund your work on the kernel pretty much full-time, which seems
to have resulted in really good free drivers.
To be honest I don't understand why people are complaining about
the fact that your model keeps some drivers closed for 18 months,
while a completely free model wouldn't even start development of
the drivers for 18 months, until after the hardware became generally
available.

Rik
