Probably not, but as we are still using good old NW3.11 call which can
retrieve only one item at a call, we get it for free without increasing
network traffic. I do not know about SMB.

Almost.

rm -rf:                              while true; do ls; done
seek(directory, 0, SEEK_SET);
[fill first X entries in dircache]
getdents(....) returned first
   X entries
libc passes Y (< X) entries to user
unlink first Y items
                                        seek(directory, 0, SEEK_SET)
                                        [mtime differs, invalidate cache]
                                        getdents(...) returns
                                           new directory state
seek(directory, Y, SEEK_SET)
[and now oops, it is Y position
now, but Y+Y position in old directory]
getdents(....) returns next X items...
If invalidate does not occur, dentries still have their old numbers.
BTW in correct caching implementation there must not be need to
invalidate cache on unlink/mkdir, you must be able to notice change
from other clients too, so why do it twice.
And as we have pointers to dentries in dircache, even if 'ls' occurs
in time window, when directory change is not checked (configurable 
0-20000ms), readdir (fs/ncpfs/dir.c:ncp_d_validate, taken from nfs) 
notices that dentry in cache is invalid and whole directory cache is 
invalidated and reread. So getdents with position after unlinked files
are still cached, but getdents with position before unlinked files
cause cache invalidation.

Then remove all cache invalidation calls except one when mtime differs.
It must then work :-)
