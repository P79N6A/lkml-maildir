AFAIK, mingo has an experimental implementation of SYSENTER/SYSEXIT for
the
PPro/PII, which will (hopefully) make it's way into 2.3 someday. On the
K6
it is called SYSCALL/SYSRET and Jean Wolter <jw5@os.inf.tu-dresden.de>
has
done some work in this area. The bad thing is that it doesn't work on
the
older K6 revisions (as mine) :-(

PS: mingo, if you read this, what's the current status of
SYSENTER/SYSEXIT ?
