Subject: ALSA ICE1724 driver doesn't work

Since google shows no results and nobody in the alsa project knows an
answer I try it here. Just say if there is a better place to ask.
When alsa is started I get the following error:
Starting ALSA (version 0.9.6): ice1724-failed failed
After shutting down X I see on the console the following message:
ALSA ../../alsa-kernel/pci/ice1712/ice1724.c:1614: invalid EEPROM (size=120)
I guess there is something in the kernel driver wrong. How can I fix
this? Is there a newer version?
