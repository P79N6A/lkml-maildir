You should only need to specify GIT_DIR - it should figure out that the 
object directory follows GIT_DIR on its own.
Also, I forget what version of git is installed on kernel.org. The
"alternates" support has been around for a while, and looking at the date
of "/usr/bin/git" it _seems_ recent (Sep 7), but I haven't seen any
announcement of updating since the last one (which was git-0.99.4, which
is too old).
You can try removing all the packs in your .git/objects/packs directory. 
Everything _should_ still work fine.
Famous last words.
