All versions of Linux-2.6
I install qt and all other stuff in /usr; and do not set
QTDIR, as it is not needed.
Can /usr be added to the scripts/kconfig/Makefile?
I attach a patch.  The last two variables of:
@set -e; for d in $$QTDIR /usr/share/qt* /usr/lib/qt*; do \
if [ -f $$d/include/qconfig.h ]; then DIR=$$d; break; fi; \
seem pointless as it is looking for a header file.
The patch just adds /usr to the end; but I suggest that the
line could be
@set -e; for d in $$QTDIR /usr; do \
