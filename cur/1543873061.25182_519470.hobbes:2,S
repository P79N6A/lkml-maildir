I guess by "paged it in" you essentially mean
"mapped the page into address space for the *first* time"?
i.e. how many times the same page mapped into 2 address spaces
in the same container should be accounted for?
We believe ONE. It is better due to:
- it allows better estimate how much RAM container uses.
- if one container mapped a single page 10,000 times,
  it doesn't mean it is worse than a container which mapped only 200 pages
  and that it should be killed in case of OOM.
Thanks,
Kirill
