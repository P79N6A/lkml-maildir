I will try that as fast as I can. I am not using -mm's since 2.6.2-mm2 
because they are usually too broken for me :-(.
IIRC, similar bug was discussed on #gentoo-bugs recently and is probably 
somewhere in Gentoo Bugzilla (
http://bugs.gentoo.org
). Several people 
noticed this. So probably if you can mount and use NTFS for a while and 
then umount it without problems this is probably fixed. If not - you can 
reproduce it simply (it is 100% reproductible and occurs only on inotified 
kernels).
Thanks,
