As I clarified to Lee in private email, this method doesn't
 seem to apply in this situation, as the problem appeared
 when I selected CONFIG_EHCI_HCD in my build due to the
 purchase of the USB2.0 disk, back in the 2.6.16-rc cycle;
 so if the combination of high performance IDE + EHCI_HCD
 ever existed, it must be earlier than 2.6.16-rc5-git8.
Lacking any input I'll try to find out more in the next week
 by starting out at 2.6.10 and eventually earlier.
Thanks, ciao,
