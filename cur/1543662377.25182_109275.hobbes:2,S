Thanks.  It's a long-standing but benign bogon which was exposed by recent
ext3 simplifications.   This needs lots of testing.
when ext3_writepage races with truncate, block_write_full_page() will see
that the page is outside i_size and will bale out with -EIO.  But
ext3_writepage() will ignore this and will proceed to add the buffers to the
transaction.
Later, kjournald tries to write them out and goes BUG() because those buffers
are not mapped to disk.
The fix is to not attach the buffers to the transaction in ext3_writepage()
if block_write_full_page() failed.
So far so good, but that page now has dirty, unmapped buffers (the buffers
were attached in a dirty state by ext3_writepage()).  So teach
block_write_full_page() to clean the buffers against the page if it is wholly
outside i_size.
(A simpler fix to all of this might be to just bale out of ext3_writepage()
if the page is outside i_size.  But that is racy against
block_write_full_page()'s subsequent execution of the same comparison).
