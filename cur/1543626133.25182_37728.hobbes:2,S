  If experience on JFS is any predictor, the external journal will be
quite useful as a performance issue. It can be put on a faster device to
avoid bottlenecks. With JFS I finally wound up with the journal on a
battery-backed SCSI solid state disk, and got about 30% faster completion
of my daily audit run which deleted ~1000000 (yes one million) files as
fast as it could when done.
  I was also creating the same number of files over the course of a day,
which is still a respectable directory change rate!
  I predict that applications which create/delete a lot of files will run
better with tuning this feature.
