But it will get data of _equal quality_ to the current approach from
/dev/urandom.

Yes. The clock of interest is the PCI bus clock, which is not terribly
fast next to a gigabit network analyzer.

Anyone who'd have that problem has it today. Current kernels only add
entropy for a small number of rare cards. Grep for SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM:
./net/e1000/e1000_main.c
./net/3c523.c
./net/ibmlana.c
./net/sk_mca.c
In reality, most apps are using /dev/urandom for routine entropy as
they should be.
