The kernel headers and thus the kernel ABI is separate and ideally
they should not depend on any other header files to provide anything.
This is why __u32, __u64 etc are preferred in the kernel ABI
and not uint32_t as used by the drm headers.
We do not adhere to this as a strict rule (yet).
But if you do:
grep -l uint32_t usr/include/linux
then you will only see 7 hits. Out of 368 files.
So we are not bad in this respect.
For drm the fix seems simple - just replace all of uint32_t with __u32.
likewise for the other 32 bit and the 64 bit variants.
For the specific case where drm includes a non-existing file I suggest
that we get this fixed in some way soon.
