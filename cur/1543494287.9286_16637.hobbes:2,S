Hello,
I have a 2.2.6 server with knfsd and a 2.0.35 client. When I NFS mount the
CDROM of the server and unmount it again, I can not unmount the CDROM
locally at the server. I get a "device busy" error. The /var/lib/nfs/rmtab
gets cleared correctly, so this can't be the problem. I use mount V2.8a. 
cu, Steffen
