Worried.
Under what operational scenarios is ths feature actually needed/used?

Kind of weird.   The thaw will happen after/during the sync().
I guess that if the sync is blocked on a frozen fs then things will
sort themselves out.
otoh, if all the pdflush threads are blocked on frozen filesystems
(possible?) then the emergency_thaw() simply won't do anything.

hm, I made the args to bdevname() backwards.  Bad me.
