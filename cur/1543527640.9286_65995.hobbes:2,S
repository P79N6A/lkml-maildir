ipconfig was supposedly fixed in 2.3.47 (according to above message), yet
its still not working as of 2.3.48-3.  
However, its not quite directly related to ipconfig...
In dev.c dev_open():
	if (!netif_device_present(dev)) 
		return -ENODEV;
That check is failing for every driver I've tried.  Are the drivers
broken?
