I just want to improve getrusage to account for the case in which a server 
process needs to have usage information about client processes at run-time.
In this case RUSAGE_SELF is more important than RUSAGE_CHILDREN.
I think it would be an useful feature for some user-level applications.
At the beginning, I didn't want to propose any different prototype for the 
function, even if I think that a more general (and correct) one would be
      int getrusage(int who, struct rusage *usage, pid_t pid);
which accounts for all the situations we discussed so far.
However, I've added a more restrictive check (as asked by David) and the goto 
proposed by Hua. Is now the patch right ? Do you think that it's useful ?
Many thanks,
            Claudio
