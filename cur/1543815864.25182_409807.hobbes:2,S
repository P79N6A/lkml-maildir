yes, it could! You could issuing ioctl with command EXT3_IOC_SETRSVSZ to
set the reservation size to match exactly what you want to reserve for.
The size here is the number of the filesystem blocks, rather in bytes.
As long as your application is doing a sequential like write
(allocation), the reservation window will dynamically doubled when
creating the new window. There is a upper limit of how big the window
could be
#define EXT3_MAX_RESERVE_BLOCKS         1024
The reason we have this limit is to prevent a file make a reservation of
the whole filesystem. But if this upper limit is too small for streaming
need, we could expand it to something bigger.
This is available since 2.6.10 kernel.

I am not sure to use truncate to indicating reservation/preallocation.
It's not obvious semantically and might complicated the code to do the
real truncating. That's why we use ioctl for reservation at the first
place.
