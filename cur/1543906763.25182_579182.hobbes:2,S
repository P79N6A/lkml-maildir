I second Alan's opinion.  The root cause of the problem is that the
controller lacks reliable IRQ masking and pending register.  If you add
a slightly malfunctioning controller and/or device into the mix, it's
guaranteed to break.
And there's another addition to the mess from SATA land which I
discovered a few days ago.  Some SATA controllers with SFF interface
don't send non-command H2D Reg FIS when ATA_NIEN is toggled, so the
updated ATA_NIEN is sent together with the next command && some SATA
devices don't honor ATA_NIEN on command H2D Reg FIS.  Fun!
I think we should go combined IRQ + polling mode Jeff once mentioned so
that we automatically fallback to polling if IRQ doesn't work for some
reason.  To do that, we need reliable IRQ masking && the only way to
achieve proper IRQ masking on SFF controllers seems plugging it from the
host side.
Thanks.
