Oops.
 I read your report lazily, and didn't do it right. I just noticed that it
isn't actually irq3 and the raid controller at 0:0f.0 that is the problem
at all: the problem is the regular legacy stuff on 0:0f.1: hdc/hdd that is
on irq15.
The IRQ probe for hdc fails, for some silly reason. 
But we actually correctly _notice_ that it's on irq15, so I
Note how we say:
	kernel: hdc: IRQ probe failed (0x3cfa)
but then a few lines later we _have_ figured it out and say
	kernel: ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
The problem _appears_ to be the fact that we already registered irq15 for 
the IDE driver, which will cause the probe to fail (you can't probe 
something that is already in use).
Can you try this patch, and see if it makes a difference? I'd also like to 
see the full "dmesg" output (regardless of whether it works or not).
