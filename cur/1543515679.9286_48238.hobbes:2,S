You still have to be careful to get the locking right. :) Remember, you
can't arbitrarily replace shared spinlocks with semaphores: shared
spinlocks will still work if you take them recursively, semaphores
won't.

Given that it calls waitpid(), they had better not. :)  Sleeping in an
interrupt is about the most illegal thing a kernel function can do!
