Does that mean that identification of containers for incoming packets
is done by IP address through routing (just had a quick look at the
patches, if I missed something obvious please just point me to it)?
How is code that uses global data without verifying its presence
(and visibility in the container) at initialization time going to be
handled? Netfilter and I think the TC action code contain some examples
for this.
