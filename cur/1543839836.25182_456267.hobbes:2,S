So far this is not deciding on anything, just trying to follow the
partially implemented draft to it's specified and logical conclusion.
It may well be that it will turn out to just not be manageable, safe, or
useful, or none of the three.

Can't do that with the fs capabilities.
But, the fs caps aren't intended to be an alternative to a policy-basd
system.  What I like about them is simply that instead of making a
binary setuid 0, and expecting it to give up the caps it doesn't need,
it can be given just the caps it needs right off the bat.
The apparmor and selinux policies would be complementary and useful as
ever on top of those, just as they currently are on top of setuid.

Yup, sigh...
A better split of the caps might be more useful than fs caps
themselves...
