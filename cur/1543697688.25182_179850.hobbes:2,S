well, i don't have a raid or mirror container configured.
the driver from 2.6.0-test9 (vanilla) runns nicely in fact, but is really, really slow,
my UDMA IDE machine is quite fast compared to the MPT.
(FYI: colleagues having the same machine running win2003 also tell me the disks are relatively slow)
further, i kindly heard from Dan Creswell <dan@dcrdev.demon.co.uk> that several 
people experience performance problems with this controller and that LSI is also 
aware of that and eager to fix this.
