I'm not using this, since my drives are not UDMA66 or UDMA100

I get 148.8 and 12 MB/sec on my IBM-DTTA-351010 drives.
I get the same message about no single word DMA due
to chip revision.
# hdparm -v /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
multcount    = 16 (on)
I/O support  =  3 (32-bit w/sync)
unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
using_dma    =  1 (on)
keepsettings =  0 (off)
nowerr       =  0 (off)
readonly     =  0 (off)
readahead    =  8 (on)
geometry     = 19650/16/63, sectors = 19807200, start = 0
What does /proc/ide/hda/settings show?
What about /proc/ide/amd74xx ?
