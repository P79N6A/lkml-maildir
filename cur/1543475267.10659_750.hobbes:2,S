No, but they're the "OEM" of the user-space component of all existing Linux 
distributions.  One can envision a Linux kernel with a BSD libc, which would 
carry a canonical triple of "x86-bsd-linux".  Or even Sun pulling some 
strangeness for low-end systems, with a Solaris-derived libc 
("x86-sun-linux").
Yeah, "pc" is pretty lousy --- but it's also what's already in use.  Then 
again, as a behavior selector it's pretty much useless.  The hypothetical 
systems above would also qualify for it....

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
