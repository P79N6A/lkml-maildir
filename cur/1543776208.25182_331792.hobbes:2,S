Okay, when I brought my laptop back into work today for audio work, it locked 
up again within two minutes. I realise now what the problem is, but I don't 
have a serial cable here, so I'll have to rely on capturing the oops from the 
console.
The only difference between work and home is that I connect over an OpenVPN 
connection at work, which is a userspace program that creates a "tun" device 
as a virtual network adaptor.
I'm convinced this is the problem, because I enabled IPMASQ on the company 
server today and bypassed the VPN, and I'm happily typing this email from the 
same computer on the same network, just with no VPN started.
It's a bizarre problem, but my guess is that your user test bed don't end up 
using tap/tun very often, which means it's poorly tested.
