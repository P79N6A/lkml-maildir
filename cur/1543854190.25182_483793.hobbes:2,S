This patch removes video drivers that:
- had already been marked as BROKEN in 2.6.0 three years ago and
- are still marked as BROKEN.
These are the following drivers:
- FB_CYBER
- FB_VIRGE
- FB_RETINAZ3
- FB_SUN3
- FB_PM3
Drivers that had been marked as BROKEN for such a long time seem to be
unlikely to be revived in the forseeable future.
But if anyone wants to ever revive any of these drivers, the code is
still present in the older kernel releases.
