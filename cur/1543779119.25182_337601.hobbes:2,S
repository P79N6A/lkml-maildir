Hi Serge.
A few trivial things I noticed whilst writing some internal documentation
on Stacker.  Nothing deep here, but thought I'd pass them along.
I'll try to actually try out the code next week.
I made these notes as I was going along,  lmk if you need them annotated
to the original patch and I'll go back and redo.
Thanks again
Tony
1) Documentation refers to /security/stacker/list_modules,  code refers to
   "listmodules".  list_modules is more consistent with other file names.
2) symbol_get(ops) still at the end of stacker_register.
3) struct module_entry{
        struct list_head lsm_list;  /* list of active lsms */
        struct list_head all_lsms;  /* list of active lsms */
   fix comments
4) Would it be useful to change the struct elements lsm_list and all_lsms to
   be consistent with their list heads (stacked_modules and all_modules).
5) /*
 * Workarounds for the fact that get and setprocattr are used only by
 * selinux.  (Maybe)
 */
No complaints on selinux getting to avoid the (module), they are intree.
Just a FYI that SubDomain/AppArmor uses these hooks also.
6) stop_responding control file is misnamed, as stacker still continues to work
   it just removes the virtual file system
7) Does the lsm_list really need to be at the top of the struct?  Good style
but not sure it is required (must).
8) security-stack.h
 * If stacker is compiled in, then we use the full functions as
 * defined in security/security.c.  Otherwise we use the #defines
 * here.
I noticed the conditional CONFIG_SECURITY_STACKER code went away, previously
it would look at the value chain head only for the !case. But this comment
still remains.
