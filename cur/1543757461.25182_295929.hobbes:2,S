This is what I get:
 2.6.8 to 2.6.10: about 30 min. I think that's clear now. I did not run
any mre test with that.
2.6.7 gives less than 10 minutes.
Reverse-Patched 2.6.8.1 and 2.6.10 about 9-11 min.
But what I think is interesting: Other than with 2.6.7, with my 2.6.10
the result seems to be highly dependent on other io activities. I came
to test that when I saw that writing to dvd-ram slowed down when reading
from a cdrom at the same time. System disk, cdrom and dvd-ram are
connected by buses as independent as possible: hda, hdd and scd0 via
on-chip ide2. hdc is inactive and spun down at the times of testing.
Some results (same command as yours, but writing to file only):
2.6.8.1 with vmscan-dont-reclaim-too-many-pages.patch
and vmscan-scan-sanity.patch reversed:
real    9m17.389s
real    10m11.271s
(run twice)
2.6.10, both patches reversed:
real    10m26.374s
same kernel, some io and high (but niced) system load by reading from
hda and gzipping into /dev/null
real    21m46.795s
same kernel, some io and low load by reading from cdrom (raw read with
dd as well) into /dev/null
real    22m11.639s
2.6.7 vanilla, some io and low load by reading from cdrom (raw read with
dd as well) into /dev/null
real	5m58.092
That's too fast - impossible on 3x media with verification. I'll check
that again. But it *really* seemed to be fast.
I also hat the impression that my tests with 2.6.10 and 2.6.8.1 were
much more promising when run from a rather basic testing system without
X, a bit closer to the 2.6.7 results. Haven't got time to check that
till monday. All the above results except the 2.6.7 are from Ubuntu
(Hoary) Systems with X and Gnome running.
