The "stable" series of the kernel is never really stable for a while. 
A better way to think of it is as "that place where things become stable
by refusing to take any new changes except bug fixes".  
The news media hasn't picked up on this yet, they seem to think that
2.6.0 is something that will be useful.  It won't be, there will be a
period of months during which things stablize and then you'll see the
distros pick up the release.  I don't remember where it was exactly
(2.4.18?) but Red Hat waited quite a while before switching to 2.4
from 2.2.  This is normal and it works out quite well in practice.
