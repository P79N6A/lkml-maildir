Yes, the kernel headers are currently borked for compiling userspace C 
libraries. The fix is going to take either a large effort to get a 
sanitized set of userspace kernel headers created, or someone to be 
willing to accept patches that fix the problems with the existing 
headers even though userspace is not supposed to be using them.
