Yes, so we agree that #ifdef CONFIG_* is not good.

I agree with this suggestion.
Each netlink attribute contains the following fields (also referred to as TLV)
+----+--------+------+
|Type| length | value|
+----+--------+------+
The type is meant to serve the purpose of the header you describe. The
type value can be used by the application to map the data. 
getdelays.c is a sample application posted in the previous patches,
it interprets data based on type.

Yes, I think in the long term it would be more useful to use the scheme
of adding subsystem structs. taskstats.txt explains the process of 
extending taskstats. Point #2 is the same as what we have just discussed.
Could you please see if the text needs any changes based on our discussions
so far (taskstats.txt was posted in the delayacct-doc.patch).
