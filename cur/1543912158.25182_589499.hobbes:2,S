No, the solution is to lock the interrupts onto one specific
processor and don't move it around.  That's what's causing
all of the problems.
And you can enforce this policy now in the driver even if just
for testing by calling the set_affinity() interfaces on the
interrupts your driver has.
You can even walk over the cpu_online_map and choose a load
distribution of your liking.
