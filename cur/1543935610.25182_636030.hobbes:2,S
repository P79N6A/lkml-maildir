What kind of driver bugs?  Do drivers manage to get into the other 
branch of the if()?  If not, can't we just remove it and avoid this 
present problem?
Of course, there are a couple of other places which use naked 
__PAGE_KERNEL_* constants, most significantly in head_64.S's initial 
pagetable setup.  Does that rely _PAGE_GLOBAL not being set?  Also 
early_io_remap().
