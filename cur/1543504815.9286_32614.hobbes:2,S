Folks, I agree that the regular info is not very user friendly, but if
you happen to run X, you should give tkinfo a try. It's info done right.
Handles like a web browser that uses info instead of HTML. Supports
multiple windows, click to follow a link, ... and is extremely light
weight. I hated info files before but now I love them!
Cheers
Rudi
