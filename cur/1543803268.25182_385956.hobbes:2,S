Sounds to me like they are doing something like what was being mentioned 
above:
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/896256/en-us
"When TSC does not increment monotonically, system components that use 
the kernel KeQueryPerformanceCounter function may not work correctly. To 
address this problem, Microsoft makes it possible for the ACPI Power 
Management Timer to be used as the operating system timer that supports 
the kernel KeQueryPerformanceCounter function. However, some programs 
may directly access the TSC by bypassing the Windows timer APIs. The 
multiple-processor Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) makes sure that the 
TSC registers on all processors on a multiple-processor computer remain 
closely synchronized. Therefore, access by system software that may be 
directed to different processors does not return different results."
Also, Microsoft's docs for QueryPerformanceCounter specify that 
different results on different CPUs will only occur if there are "bugs 
in the basic input/output system (BIOS) or the hardware abstraction 
layer (HAL)" and recommends that threads using this function set their 
affinity to run on one processor only.
