I had in mind an explanation that works with "patch -p1" ... :)
There's already a call to register a root hub.  It'd be dangerous
to have some other thread try to share responsibilities with khubd,
so that call would likely need to be modified.  (Although there's
been a bit of discussion about actually getting rid of that specific
single-point-of-failure, since not all hub operations need to be
serialized.)
