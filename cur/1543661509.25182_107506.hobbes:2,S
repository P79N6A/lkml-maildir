Unfortunatelly your changes in fs/proc/proc_misc.c broke every arch that
still uses HZ=100 (e.g. UML), because there is no "times" field in task
struct.
See this part:
+       {
+               unsigned long idle = init_task.times.tms_utime
+                                    + init_task.times.tms_stime;
In order to get UML to compile again (and pretty much any other HZ=100 arch)
I need to apply this patch below:
