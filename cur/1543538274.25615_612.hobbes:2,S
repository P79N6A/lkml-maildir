For the record:
After some off-list help help from Alexy, I now use getsockopt() with
SO_PEERCRED to read the credentials.   This is a much easier solution to the
problem, that I was previously unaware of existed.
Big thanks go to Alexy for his patience in this, and apologies to the rest of
you for clobbering the list with non-kernel programming problems.    It did
turn out to be kernel-related though, but not a definite bug in the kernel.
Returning semi-random errors from undefined calls is an oddity, not a bug  :)
Oddities are good, without them there would be no adventure and no mysteries
left.    :)
Cheers,
