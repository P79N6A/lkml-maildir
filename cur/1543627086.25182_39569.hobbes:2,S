Ok, I may have been confused by looking only at the patch file

Fine, though I noticed the get_cmap_len got changed to
+	return var->bits_per_pixel == 8 ? 256 : 16;

Ok use a fixed fbtv, I agree.

Maybe we should use the HW cursor. Setting the top indice will cause
problem with MacOnLinux as MacOS don't use the same color layout as
most unix apps.
Anyway, I'll look at your patch more closely and test it asap,
Ben.
