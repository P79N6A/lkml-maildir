I intend using them for controlling SiS hardware specific settings like 
switching output devices, checking modes against output devices, 
repositioning TV output, scaling TV output, changing gamma correction, 
tuning video parameters, and the like. The goal is to be able to write a 
program similar to what sisctrl is for X (see my website for details on 
sisctrl).
I have no list yet as I first wanted to know if somebody opposes for 
reasons like 0xf3/0x0-0x40 being used by another driver already. I 
quickly grep-ed but found none.
And rest assured, they will be 32/64 bit safe. Not sure what you mean by 
"ioctl interface" here but have a look at the Matrox framebuffer driver 
which uses some 'n' ioctls for similar stuff (which in that way do not 
apply to the SiS hardware which is why I can't reuse them).
