Thank you for taking the time to make it! I now understand the problem
not only well enough to avoid it, but to ask another question below.

It would seem that wanting to use both flash keys and more common USB
devices would be the common case for those who use flash keys at all.
Would it be possible to have the regular USB drivers support the slow
devices, if only to the extent of handing them off as they do CD, NIC, or
disk? Or are these slow devices so unique that they are totally
incompatible with faster devices?
