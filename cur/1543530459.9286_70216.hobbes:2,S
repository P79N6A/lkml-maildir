AFAIU, what your macro is supposed to be doing is:
   static int g(int x) { /* ... */ }
   int public_func(int) __alias__(("g"));
   extern inline int g(int x) { return x; }
Now there are two different definitions of g() in the source, this is
definitely wrong.
What I see your macro doing is totally different, BTW. Perhaps you meant
something like:
   extern inline int throw_this_away(int x) { return g(x); }
? This won't protect against some lost soul defining:
   static double g(float x);
...
What I propose is:
a) Get GCC to consider the alias as an use
b) A macro that does:
   int public_func(int) __alias__(("g"));
   static int g(int);
The prototype protects against strange definitions of g(), and is legal
anyway, even when placed before the definition of g() proper.
But perhaps I'm just being dense...
