Subject: [ANNONCE] Another bootloader - non fonctionnal version

  Hello,
  Only slightly related to kernel development, but
 I would like here to make public my project of
 a new GPL bootloader for Intel called "gujin".
  It's most visible characteristic is that it
 is extensively using GCC to produce real-mode
 code (few Kbytes of source already), for the
 other characteristics see at:
ftp://ftp.varesearch.com/pub/support/hjl/binutils/16bit/readme.1st
  There is stuff precompiled for the 3 minutes test,
 source for the 1 hour test or more stuff for the
 next months. Because it is my pleasure and not my
 work, the doc is mostly the source. A lot of work
 has still to be done before having a first real
 version.
  Note that this list is already too much loaded,
 so it is not the place to discuss feature or ask
 questions. As usual, my E-mail address would
 mostly like patches...
  Have a nice day,
  Etienne.
Note: The beta version of binutil used as reference is:
ftp://ftp.varesearch.com/pub/support/hjl/binutils/beta/binutils-2.9.5.0.3.tar.gz
--  Hem, who has just turned off the light?
--  Oh no, that's just a paper bag on my head.
