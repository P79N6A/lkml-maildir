Hi Vojtech,
Please apply the following patch to hid-core.c.   It adds a device to the
exception-/blacklist.
The device is a Wireless Security Lock (WSL).   The device identifies itself
as a Cypress Ultra Mouse.   It is, however, not a mouse at all and as such,
shouldn't be handled as one, which is why I want to put it on the blacklist.
The patch is also attached as a gzipped archive - it seems that my mailer
screws up from time to time.
