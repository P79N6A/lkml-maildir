Hello
It appears regularly when I try to compile 
http://thebsh.namesys.com/snapshots/2004.03.26/reiser4progs-0.5.3.tar.gz
Well, on 2.6.7-mm1 it breaks easier. on 2.6.7-mm2 - it manages to 
compelte once.
(gdb) bt
#0  0xc013c75a in anon_vma_unlink (vma=0xcdb7a3c0) at 
include/linux/list.h:164
Cannot access memory at address 0xc013c738
Has anyone ever seen something similar? Is there workaround already?
I would be glad to perform any tests to help fixing this
