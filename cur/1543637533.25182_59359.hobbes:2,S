depends how deep you need to go into the oops. I would say I find myself
going into the asm of the vmlinux 9 times out of 10 (basically every
time I cannot guess the problem by just looking at the oops without
doing any real debugging). so yes kksymoops may help once in a while,
but all other times I would probably be faster asking gdb to disasm a
certain fixed hex address (that will give me the symbol too of course :).
So I don't feel the need of kksymoops, at least given I can find out
what kernel the user was running, that will be possible by printing the
uname -a information in the oops too. So with a "featured oops" with
uname -a + module start info + database we'll have all we need to decode
whatever oops usually without significant slowdown compared to
kksymoops, but nevertheless if we're ok to waste some hundred kbyte of
ram (and mbytes of space on disk for the numerous modules) also
kksymoops will be fine. But nevertheless kksymoops should be a config
option, so when disabled my "featured oops" wish still apply :)
