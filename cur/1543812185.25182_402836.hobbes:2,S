I wouldn't worry about splitting patches to make their application easier -
the main thing is to ensure that they're logical units from the
design/implementation POV.  And that the kernel should compile (and
hopefully run) at each stage of the series.
And don't worry about the -mm-only patches - I'll sort them out.  Unless
people are working against functionality which is only in -mm, they should
work against mainline.
But in the case where you're hitting hard on a particular subsystem, the
best tree to work against is that subsystem's tree.  Which is a bit of a
pain if you want to put your feature out to external testers, because then
you need to also make a snapshot of the subsystem tree available as well. 
That's just a cost of doing business, really.  It ends up being extremely
simple if one is using quilt.
