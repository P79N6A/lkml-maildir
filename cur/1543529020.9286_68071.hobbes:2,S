OK, I think I have it fixed, and would _really_ appreciate it if you would
test/confirm.  (would very much like to see this problem finally die..
and stay dead long enough for someone to actually use the device :)
The problem is one of aliases.  I don't fully understand it, but the
only way I have ever (since page_cache was born) been able to get the
thing to act fully sane is to unconditionally copy the data to and fro.
This patch does that, keeps protection problem internal to the driver,
and adds an in kernel ramdisk_blocksize setup option. Reasoning for
adding the setup option is simply because if module has the option,
in kernel setup should also have it also.
I am going to veeeeeeery thoroughly test this bugger before sending
it off to Linus for consideration, and would appreciate it if folks
who use ramdisk and initrd would give it a trial burn.
