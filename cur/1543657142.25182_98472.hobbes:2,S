Hmm. Unless I'm reading it wrong, this doesn't agree with the
example 7-1c on page 7-14 of the P4 Optimization manual,  or ?
This is also interesting  - quote
"The inc and dec instructions should always be avoided. Using add and sub
instructions instead of inc and dec instructions avoid data dependence and
improve performance."
