Hi,
There are new CD-ROM patches available.
CD-ROM / DVD specific, 2.2.14
	
http://www.kernel.dk/dvd-cd-2.2.14-3.diff.bz2
CD-ROM / DVD specific, 2.3.38
	
http://www.kernel.dk/cd-2.3.38-1.diff.bz2
CD-ROM / DVD + IDE
	
http://www.kernel.dk/dvd-ide-2.2.14-2.diff.bz2
Changelog:
	- Fix up door locking in ide-cd. We used to lock after nearly
	  every packet command, which both wasn't necessary and
	  made it virtually impossible to control the locking from
	  user space.
	- Merge Andre' latest IDE fixes in dvd-ide tree.
Specifically the door locking changes I'd like to get some exposure
before submitting to Linus. Other than that there's no need to upgrade
if you are already running a prior 2.2.14 version.
