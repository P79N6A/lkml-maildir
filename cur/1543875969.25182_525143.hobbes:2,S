I have to disagree, since wrapping it into a struct and copying the struct
in kernelspace from userspace requires more code. Pointers only become
useful at 3 (rarely) or 4 (yeah, more likely) and 5+ (definitely)
arguments, (3) see above about copying, (4) middle thing and (5) tons of
arguments like mmap() should be wrapped up... for simplicity of dealing
with it later.
