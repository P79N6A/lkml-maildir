Hmm ... well, getting at current_thread_info()->cpu is possible, but
nasty to audit, I would have thought (given that we're in assembler
before start_kernel is called).

I was wondering about simply replacing boot_cpu_init() with
smp_prepare_boot_cpu().  By and large they do the same thing on most
archs, and mostly they don't seem to depend on setup_arch() having been
called.
However, introducing setup_smp_processor_id() will also work ... I'll
see if I can do it in an easy way.
