So, one disrespects a lot, the other disrespects a little.  Is that
relevant, when the requirement is "no further restrictions"?

Everyone who donates to it does so understanding what the mission is.
Detracting from that mission would be failing the public commitment.
Sure, it may have been self-imposed in the beginning, but maybe not
even then.  At least in Brazil, foundations are started by an initial
donor, who determines its mission, and it has a legal obligation to
pursue that mission, and IIRC it cannot be changed except by a court
order, and even than within certain limits.

I was pretty sure this had been covered in the section about technical
barriers to modification in the third draft's rationale, but I can't
find it right now.  
http://gplv3.fsf.org/gpl3-dd3-rationale.pdf
Anyhow, the argument I read went like: if there's an agreement between
the parties to do this, then the copyright holder can probably enforce
the license regardless of the software and hardware distributor being
different parties, since the software is being distributed with
information whose purpose is to enable the hardware to deny the user
the freedom to run modified versions of the software.
However, if there's no such agreement, if the copyright holder has no
copyright claims over the hardware or works shipped in it, there's
nothing the copyright holder can do about it, and that's probably how
it should be, since a copyright license (!= contract) can't possibly
prohibit people from creating hardware limited in function, it can
only tell people that, in order for them to have permission to modify
or distribute the covered work, they must abide by certain conditions.
And if they don't want to abide by the conditions, and they don't
manage to obtain a license from the copyright holders that doesn't
impose conditions they can't accept, they just can't modify or
distribute the work.
