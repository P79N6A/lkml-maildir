I have not followed the discussion and probably say something
entirely out of context. But from the good old days I seem to
recall commands 0xff "reset", 0xf5 "set defaults and deactivate"
and reply 0xfe "please resend".
In principle nothing is wrong when one gets a 0xfe.
The request is just: please say that again.
