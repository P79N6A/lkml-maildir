Linus asked how do shellscripts _drop_ power. For shellscripts run
nightly from cron it is very good idea to drop some of their
capabilities. So no, I do not want default shell suid0.
But take a look at sperl, they obviously have suid0 interpretter, and
if you wanted possibility for setuid shell scripts, making setuid
version of bash (of course aware of situation - like sperl is) would
be the way.
