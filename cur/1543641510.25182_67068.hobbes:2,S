 From what I understand this happens when these conditions are met:
1. You use a recent version of binutils (Debian has one)
2. CONFIG_HOTPLUG is not set
3. You compile a driver that doesn't properly use __devexit_p macro
I fixed this in the IPS driver:

So, find and fix the driver, use hotplug, or get an older binutils.
