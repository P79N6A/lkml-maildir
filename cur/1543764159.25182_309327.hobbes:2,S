I don't agree with you. First I don't see any advantages to use 
"discontigmem" just
because physical ram address doesn't start to 0. I would embed and run 
extra code
that is not needed for my case.
Secondly, even if you're right, code that uses "addr >> PAGE_SHIFT" are 
by-passing
mm api, that is somehow a hack....
Cheers.
