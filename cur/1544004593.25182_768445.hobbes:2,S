Subject: [PATCH 2/2] ftrace: show buffer size in kilobytes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/11/13/4

Impact: change the units of buffer_size to kilobytes
This patch changes the units of the buffer_size file to kilobytes.
Reading and writing to the file uses kilobytes as units. To help
users to know what units are used, the output of the file now
looks like:
  # cat /debug/tracing/buffer_size
  1408 (units kilobytes)

 Note, to modify this, you must have tracing completely disabled. To do that,
 echo "nop" into the current_tracer. If the current_tracer is not set
 to "nop", an EINVAL error will be returned.

 The number of pages which will be allocated is limited to a percentage
 of available memory. Allocating too much will produce an error.
