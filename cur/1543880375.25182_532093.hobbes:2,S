Yes, I understand.  If you had immediate-disconnect then you wouldn't need 
device_unregister_wait().  In fact, you wouldn't need any reference counts 
at all.  It would be guaranteed that when the unregister call returned, 
all references would be gone.

No, no.  You tell somebody (it might be a higher layer, it might be a 
lower layer, or it might be a same-height layer -- doesn't matter) that a 
device is going away.  On return from the function, that layer isn't going 
to access the device any more, _nor_ will anyone else who has obtained a 
reference from that layer.  This last clause is very important.

You have to convert more than layers (or core subsystems).  You also have 
to audit and convert drivers.  It will be tremendously difficult to do.

You did misunderstand.  Here's what I was talking about:
Driver A:
---------
	unregister_device(dev);
		/* inside the driver core */
		down(&dev->sem);
		if (dev->driver)
			dev->driver->remove(dev);
		up(&dev->sem);
		device_put(dev);	/* or device_put_wait */
Driver B:
---------
void remove(struct device *dev)
{
	struct my_device *mydev = dev_get_drvdata(dev);
	mydev->gone = 1;
	kref_put(&mydev->kref, my_device_release);
}
Driver B's kernel thread:
-------------------------
	kref_get(&mydev->kref);
	down(&mydev->dev.sem);
	if (mydev->gone)
		goto finished;
	...
 finished:
	up(&mydev->dev.sem);
	kref_put(&mydev->kref, my_device_release);
Consider what happens if the kernel thread blocks on its down() while the
remove() method is running.  It will be impossible for Driver B to
eliminate the reference to dev held by mydev and by the down() routine.
In short, Driver B _can't_ provide an immediate detach.  Not unless 
someone figures out a way to cancel a blocked down().  And do the same 
thing for other blocking primitives.
