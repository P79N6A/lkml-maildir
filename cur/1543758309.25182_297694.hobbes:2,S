Can you please post the oops? Have you done so already? 
What makes you think it is the same race discussed in the above thread? 
BTW, I fail to see any drivers/char/pty.c change related to the race which triggers
the pty_chars_in_buffer->0 oops.
Quoting the first message from thread you mention:
"That last call trace entry is the call in pty_chars_in_buffer() to 
	/* The ldisc must report 0 if no characters available to be read */ 
	count = to->ldisc.chars_in_buffer(to);
"
Alan, Linus, what correction to the which the above thread discusses has 
been deployed?

Can you compile a list of such v2.4 reports?
