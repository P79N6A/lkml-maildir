Ingo & Steve,
   Thank you for your great instructions that even a guitar player
could basically follow. After about an hour of messing around I did
manage to capture the crash. The console file is attached.
NOTE: The first time I booted the kernel it got to the crash point and
the machine rebooted. The second time it booted I got the trace. Both
boots are in the capture file.
   Hope this helps!
Cheers,
Mark
