Dear Linux Technology Developers,
You are invited to participate in the LinuxWorld Greenhouse at the 
LinuxWorld Conference & Expo in San Jose, California. LinuxWorld is 
the premier exposition targeted at the Linux community and will 
attract thousands of qualified attendees.
The LinuxWorld Greenhouse is a customized event area designed to 
highlight emerging developers of the Linux community and will provide 
affordable display space and access for smaller companies. 
Participation in the Greenhouse is aimed at small companies (up to 
ten employees) which are on technology's cutting edge. (More details 
below).
Born out of IDG's history with pavilions at a number of shows, the 
LinuxWorld Greenhouse will be similar to hugely successful pavilions 
such as Developer Central at Macworld Expo. This is LinuxWorld's 
solution for the small, up and coming exhibitor who cannot yet 
justify or afford a full booth presence on the show floor. Please 
note that your deadline to RSVP to this invitation is:
      *** Friday, January 14, 1999 ***
We're excited about the LinuxWorld Greenhouse -- as we are about 
LinuxWorld in general and we look forward to having you be a part of 
the show.
Best regards,
Greenhouse Management Team
