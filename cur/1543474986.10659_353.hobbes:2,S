How is the policy regarding experimental code
in the stable kernels? I see a difference between
"perhaps won't work" and "this can trash your data".
In the second case the config should probably
scream loudly and not hope that the Joe Random User
clicks on the help button ...

Well - this ends relatively early compared to the output of
the successfull mount:
ntfs_read_super
lock_super
Done reading boot block
Going to init volume
MFT record at cluster 0x8
Done to init volume
set_blocksize
kmalloc: Size (503808) too large
unlock_super
read_super: done
I have added a debug output before the ntfs_malloc
right after the set_blocksize - vol->mft_recordsize
is the 503808 (0x7b000) and vol->clustersize is 2048.
