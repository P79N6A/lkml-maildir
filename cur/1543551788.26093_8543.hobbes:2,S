No, a sequence is not ok, even if the beginning is unpredictable.
Why?  The encryption of 0 with IV v followed by encryption of 1 with IV v+1
is distinguishable from the reverse.  (Because, with high probability,
v and v+1 differ only in their low bit.)
The problem is that the patterns in the IV sequence can interact with
patterns in the plaintext.  And, if the plaintext is patterned (e.g.,
ASCII-encoded English), there is a reasonable chance that you can get
two plaintexts which start with blocks that differ only in their low
bit; and this is the case that leads to the bad interaction, when you
use a counter as your IV sequence.
Using SHA1(sector #) should be ok, as long as you don't expect your
plaintexts to have similar patterns.  (If you do think your plaintexts
might begin with the SHA1-hashes of sector numbers, you could use a
"keyed hash", or more precisely, a pseudorandom function.  For instance,
you could encrypt the sector number using a secret IV-generation key.)
