in this case please send me a system compatable with my tivo so that I can
hack on it since you are telling me I'm not going to be able to swap disks
between it and any sane system.
doing without DMA is very reasonable and not a significant problem (yes it
slows me down if I am duplicating drives, but if I am mounting the drive
so that I can go in and vi the startup files the speed difference doesn't
matter)
