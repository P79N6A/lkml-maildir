I rather think a non-fsync() system has a very much higher rate of  
successful mail deliveries than a /dev/null one, and only slightly (if at  
all) lower than a fsync() one.
Now, that slight difference *can* be rather important if you're a major  
mail hub - or it can be below the noise level in an end user system. In  
either case, however, *nobody* will accept /dev/null as an equivalent  
substitute.
Well, nobody but you.
