Maybe I should mention this, too:
accept(5, {sa_family=AF_INET6, sin6_port=htons(59821), inet_pton(AF_INET6, "::ffff:127.0.0.1", &sin6_addr), sin6_flowinfo=0, sin6_scope_id=0}, [18446744069414584348]) = 8
setsockopt(8, SOL_TCP, TCP_NODELAY, [1], 4) = 0
And if it would be the Nagle algorithm, it should also impact the
ethernet case.
