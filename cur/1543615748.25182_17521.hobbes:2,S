I'd actually argue against this.  When Alan picked up 2.2.x, there
wasn't someone else doing an -ac'ish 2.2 release as well.  Marcelo is
doing 2.4.x now, and seems to be doing a good job of making sure stable
stuff gets in, and other stuff doesn't.  The only patches that won't
make it into Marcelos tree in the very-near-term (Which is all I'll
speculate about) are the preempt (and lock-break) patches.
Please people, more trees are not always a better thing when you're all
doing the same thing.
