   If it is root that is writing, it will use the reserved space anyway so
   depending on the reserved size it will take longer or shorter for
   root to fill the fs whiel others can't write to it.
   There might be fs that will not have any root activity, so a root cushion
   is not needed. If for some reason you need emergency space you can always
   borrow from other fs.
If you read my original message, you will see that I said this was
mostly true for the /usr and /var partitition, where root does need to
write log files, so it's important that root have a cushion.

   If the reserved space is used for allocations then in the end also the
   reserved space will be fragmented. In that case it all depends on the
   dynamics on the fs. But sooner or later you will need to defragment in
   order to improve fs performance and restore the contigious reserved
   space.
It depends on what how big the files you are writing.  It's not
necessary for the free space to be contiguous; just large enough so that
files written to the disk can still be contiguous.  For example, for an
5% of 8 gig is 40 megs.  If most of the files you write are smaller than
1 meg, it's likely that the files can be stored contiguously, even if
the filesystem only has 5-10% free space on it.
   It is not that I question the use of reserved space. I just want to have
   finer control over it. In the end it is just a tuning parameter. The
   default can still be 5%. Allowing fraction percentages might also do
   the job...
That's reasonable.  The next time I mess with tune2fs and mke2fs, I'll
see what I can do on that front.
