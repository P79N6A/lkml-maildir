Ok, I have several things, since work is being done on this..
rename bond_xmit to bond_xmit_roundrobin, so bond_xmit_xor can be
implemented, and used if desired.  bond_xmit_xor is what cisco
etherchannel/sun trunking really uses, not round robin.
Remove the variable counters from the xmit loop..  Make it more like:
(from the 2.4 bonding driver)
start = slave = bond
do {
	if (slave == bond)
		continue;
	if (blah..blah)
		do xmit()
		return 0;
	}
} while ((slave=slave->next) != start_at);
kfree(skb);
return 0;
This simplifies the transmit path; and bonding is cpu intensive already!
I'd also like to get the help included.. see attached patch for that!

+Bonding driver support

+  Channels together. This is called 'Etherchannel' by Cisco,
+  'Trunking' by Sun, and 'Bonding' in Linux.

 CONFIG_SLIP
