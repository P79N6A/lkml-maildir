Not a damn thing.
We clear the PTE's _before_ we even start the write. The writeback does 
nothing to them. If the user dirties the page while writeback is in 
progress, we'll take the page fault and re-dirty it _again_.

No it's not. It's right there. "pte_wrprotect(entry)". You even copied it 
yourself.

So we call "do_wp_page()", and that does everythign right.
