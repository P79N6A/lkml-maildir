Yes, interbench tries to assess interactivity, but it gets it totally
wrong sometimes.  It runs it's measurement at a high priority, and calls
the result good if it was able to get as much cpu as it wants.  The very
code responsible for good interbench numbers is also responsible for
starvation problems.  It's the long sleep logic.  That logic makes my
box suck rocks under thud and irman2.
Don't forget, every one of the exploits I test with were posted by
people who were experiencing scheduler problems in real life.  Try to
use your box while running those exploits, and then tell me that you
agree with interbench's assessment.
