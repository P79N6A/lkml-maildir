Hi,
    I'm having trouble connecting to the http based admin ports on my 
LinkSys VPN router (BEFVP41) using the 2.6.0-test4 kernel on Redhat 9. 
The connectivity works fine with 2.4.20-19.9 from Redhat as well as 
other 2.4.x kernels. With the 2.6 kernel, I can ping the machine, but 
can't connect to the http ports (80, 8080)

Trying 192.168.3.1...
telnet: connect to address 192.168.3.1: Connection refused
The VPN router is doing NAT correctly for both kernels, and connectivity 
to services other than the router itself is fine.
I am not sure where to even begin debugging this problem.
