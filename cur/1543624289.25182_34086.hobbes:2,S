You don't.  The headers in /usr/include/linux and /usr/include/asm
(which may be a symlink to /usr/src/linux/include/linux and
/usr/src/linux/include/asm, respectively) should point to the kernel
headers that were present when _glibc_ was compiled.
Thus the kernel headers should match your current glibc, not your
current kernel.  This is fine because the kernel will maintain backward
compatibility with the previous interfaces.
If there is something in the new kernel you want/need, recompile your
glibc against those new kernel headers and install accordingly.
