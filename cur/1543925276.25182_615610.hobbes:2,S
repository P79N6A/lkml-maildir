The 4GB boundary here is MAX_DMA32_ADDRESS I guess? We are only having 
this problem because of the two DMA zones on x86_64. I thought Andi was 
getting rid of the first one at 16MB. If he would do so then ZONE_DMA 
could be used instead of DMA32 and everything will be fine.
For now you may want to put
#ifdef CONFIG_ZONE_DMA32
around this code since it depends on DMA32.
