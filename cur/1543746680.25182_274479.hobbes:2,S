As noted by Hugh, the problem also applies for
SHM_UNLOCK: anyone can unlock any System V shared 
memory segment.  If our reason for locking memory 
was security (no swapping), then this does allow
for exploits.
(Also, I just want to reemphasise that these semantics
are inconsistent with the types of ownership and 
permission checking performed for just about 
every other kind of System V "ctl" operation.)
Cheers,
Michael
