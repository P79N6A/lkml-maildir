Jon,
   would it be possible to have something less then an initrd that would 
allow the firmware blob to be packaged with the kernel? Your approach is 
just fine if the things that will need firmware are compiled as modules 
(the firmware can be placed on the same filesystem image as the modules 
that need it) but some people prefer to build monolithic kernel images, 
and in those cases there is no way for the kernel to get the firmware as 
there is no filesystem available yet.
I know that Rob Landley is doing some tricks with firmware linux to append 
an initramfs to the kernel image (
http://www.landley.net/code/firmware/
). 
There is already support in the kconfig for specifying the initramfs 
source, why culdn't we have the build process fetch any firmware needed by 
the non-modular portions and store them at the end of the kernel image so 
that they can be found during boot.
if nothing else make a skeleton initramfs that contains the modules and 
just enough other logic to continue the boot process as if the initramfs 
wasn't involved.
right now I have a laptop that's not working on wireless due to this exact 
problem (ipw2200 driver, and I haven't taken the time to setup modules for 
it yet)

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
