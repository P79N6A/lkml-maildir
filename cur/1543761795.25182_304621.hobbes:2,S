Version 0.0.5 of yaird is now available at:
	
http://www.xs4all.nl/~ekonijn/yaird/yaird-0.0.5.tar.gz
Yaird is a proof of concept perl rewrite of mkinitrd.  It aims to
reliably identify the necessary modules by using the same algorithms
as hotplug, and comes with a template system to to tune the tool for
different distributions and experiment with different image layouts.
It requires a 2.6 kernel with hotplug.  There is a paper discussing it at:

Summary of user visible changes for version 0.0.5
     * adapt Debian template to use initramfs rather than initrd.
       The old initrd template is available as Debian-initrd.
     * allow template to see requested kernel version,
       and to copy a complete tree to the image.  This makes it
       possible to put /lib/modules/2.6.10-smp on the image and do hotplug.
     * add command line option --root=/dev/hdb, to simplify testing.
     * add run_init: executable to make the move to the real root
       device in initramfs context.
     * README: new section on (optional) use of klibc,
       new section on replacing mkinitrd during kernel install.
     * more reliable shared library detection: works with glibc and
       klibc; if other C libraries use shared libraries, an error
       message results.
     * Documentation: writeup on initramfs, notes on shared libraries.
     * change installation directory from /usr/local/share/yaird/
       to /usr/local/lib/yaird/, since there are executables included now.
On top of the todo list are now:
     * support modprobe.conf
     * support dm_crypt
     * support loopback devices as root
     * any patches you may wish to send :)
Regards,
Erik
