In as much as eeprom is a demonstration driver, with very little actual
usefulness except as a test device for us sensors people... I think it
could probably be removed from the kernel altogether if we create a user-
space (w/ i2c-dev interface) replacement for it.

If read/write support is needed, IMHO it should be implemented as a proper
char device.  The sysfs interface of the current driver makes little sense.
OTOH, note that it would be possible to break RAM modules *permanently* by
misusing such a device.  The eeprom itself would still work, but the SIMM
or DIMM that it sits on would be effectively broken.  I don't personally
consider that a good argument against an eeprom char device, but some do.
