it's not a closed economy - the CPU constantly produces a resource: "CPU 
cycles to be spent", and tasks constantly consume that resource. So in 
that sense small inaccuracies are not a huge issue. But you are correct 
that each and every such inaccuracy has to be justified. For example 
larger inaccuracies on the order of SCHED_LOAD_SCALE are a problem 
because they can indeed sum up, and i fixed up a couple of such 
inaccuracies in -v6-to-be.
