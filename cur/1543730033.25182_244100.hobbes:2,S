Sounds good.  I wouldn't know one if it bit me on the leg, though, can
you point to list archives, a web site, or reassure me that if I
google for it I will get the right information?  I'd like models or a
range of models if possible, and why they don't work, and any notes or
additional information about the situation.
Thanks!
