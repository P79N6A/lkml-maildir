What's up with CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM_SIZE?  It is
set in .config by "make config", but it not
used by the kernel.   
I checked the cvs tree and see that it was used
for in a single rev of the file.  Looks to me
like this change may have been lost by accident.
Can anyone confirm or deny?  Is someone who can
fix this on this maillist? 
cvs diff -r1.59 -r1.60 rd.c
< int rd_size = 8192;           /* Size of the RAM disks */
< int rd_size = 4096;           /* Size of the RAM disks */
> int rd_size = CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM_SIZE;        /* Size of the RAM disks */
cvs diff -r1.60 -r1.61 rd.c
< int rd_size = CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM_SIZE;        /* Size of the RAM disks */
> int rd_size = 4096;           /* Size of the RAM disks */
