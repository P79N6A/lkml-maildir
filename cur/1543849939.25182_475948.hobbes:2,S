That's different.
I don't know where these patches are leading, but thus far they look like
reasonable cleanups and generalisations.  So I suggest we just take them
one at a time.

uswsusp seems like a bad idea to me.  We'd be better off concentrating on a
simple, clean in-kernel thing which *works*.  Right now the main problems
with swsusp are that it's slow and that there are driver problems. 
(Actually these are both driver problems).
Fiddling with the top-level interfaces doesn't address either of these core
problems.
Apparently uswsusp has gained support for S3 while the in-kernel driver
does not support S3.  That's disappointing.
