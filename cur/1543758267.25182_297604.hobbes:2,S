I think my phase 1 and your phase 0 are actually the same. I'm not
proposing that we put any Xen code in the tree at this point, but that
we do the many easy cleanups to i386 which will mean that we can remove
modifications to files from the arch/xen tree we maintain .
Example cleanups would be: use a macro for testing to see whether you're
in the kernel or not; use isa_bus_to_virt instead of phys_to_virt for
the access the address of the VGA console etc etc.

We'd certainly still need to have xen-specific versions of some of the
i386 header files. Perhaps the neatest thing is to have an
include/asm-i386/xen ahead of include/asm-i386 on the include search
path?  Not sure.
