Also throwing a signal to get the ucontext is pretty a expensive way of getting
it. But you folks know this already. Solaris threading has this via a some special
libraries. For large number of actively running threads, say, executing in a middle
of a method block it is potentially a huge problem for scalability.
Again, it's a critical issue from what I see of this.
