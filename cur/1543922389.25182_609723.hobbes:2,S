Well, no! we take the global lock only while bumping up the refcount. 
We don't hold the lock while scanning over the cpus. And this is
definitely an improvement over the lock_cpu_hotplug() global mutex
we have now.

Oh yes! You are probably refering to 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/26/73
which was posted a year ago. Unfortunately it didn't get much review, 
and we moved on towards a bunch of other implementations.
Anyway, the first step would be to move away from locks towards
a refcount model. Later on we can use rcu + per-cpu refcounts thereby
making it scalable on the read side.

8 cpus on i386 and x86_64.
16 cpus on ppc64.
