Any papers to look at?

A nanokernel is a piece of software in my book?

Single CPU cycle for searching data in memory? Impossible.

Something must shuffle the data from "regular memory" into "message
memory", so I bet that soon becomes the bottleneck. And the duplicate data
paths add to the cost, money that could be spent on making memory access
faster, so...

Your head would apin when looking at how fast this gets into Linux if there
were such machines around, and it is worth it.

Not yet another baroque CISC design, this time around with 1/3 of an OS in
it!

Perhaps most people that don't see the point do have a point?

Sorry, all this has been doomsayed (with different numbers) from 1965 or
so.

Right.

Hyperthreading and multi-core /are/ SMP, just done a bit differently.
