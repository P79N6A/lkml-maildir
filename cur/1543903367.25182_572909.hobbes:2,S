no, only barrier() due to cpu_relax()

I think you are right, I can't imagine a valid usage of spin_unlock_wait()
without a barrier.
For example, from net/dccp/ccid.c
	static void ccids_write_lock(void)
	{
		spin_lock(&ccids_lock);
		while (atomic_read(&ccids_lockct) != 0) {
			spin_unlock(&ccids_lock);
			yield();
			spin_lock(&ccids_lock);
		}
	}
	static inline void ccids_read_lock(void)
	{
		atomic_inc(&ccids_lockct);
		spin_unlock_wait(&ccids_lock);
	}
This looks racy, in theory atomic_inc() and spin_unlock_wait() could be
re-ordered. However, in this particular case we have an "optimized"
smp_mb_after_atomic_inc(), perhaps it is good that the caller can choose
the "right" barrier by hand.
Oleg.
