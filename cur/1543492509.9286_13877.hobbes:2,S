No, because capabilities can only be granted by the sysadmin
(root). Therefore capability-granting binaries are suid-root and the
kernel looks at the ELF CAP header.
Suid-non-root binaries are different: they switch identity. The kernel
doesn't check the ELF CAP header.
If some ordinary user wants to create a binary that grants
capabilities *to others*, he must ask the sysadmin for permission. If
the sysadmin agrees, he runs a tool to edit/audit the ELF CAP header
and then chowns to root and chmod u+s.
