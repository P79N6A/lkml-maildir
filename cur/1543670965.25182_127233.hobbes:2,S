Yeah, it's pretty hard. I didn't do all these changes with the intent of
it being a 2.4.21 thing, but it definitely dragged on to the point where
I had no choice, and pulling the fixes out of the major work became too
much work.

If you could just commit patches to the bk repo as you get them, instead
of holding them for a month and dumping them all in at once, it would be
easier to follow things. Instead, we got several huge lumps late in
2.4.21-pre's.
Wasn't my intent to bash you, but I will admit that 2.4.21 has been a
pain in my ass because of the cycle :)
