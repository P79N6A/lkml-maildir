Ah, you're totally right.   The casual dismissal of devfs (something I
really think is a great idea especially after seeing how nicely it works
in BeOS) got my ranting more than thinking.  My bad.
To use the BeOS model for such things (I know what the names are like
better there):
scsi_disk -> scsi_bus_manager -> usb_sim -> usb_bus_manager -> uhci_hcd
Where scsi_disk is a device driver and everything below is a module.
I'll still maintain that dynamic publishing of devices is a huge win,
though in this case it's not (directly) applicable.
