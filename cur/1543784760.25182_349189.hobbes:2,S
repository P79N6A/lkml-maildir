If you look at spi.h you will see the spi_device
structure :). My comment about suspend/resume was that
I based my suspend/resume functions on those in
platform.c.

That is what my suspend/resume functions are doing
(maybe incorrectly). My current understanding is that
it is the job of the bus layer (e.g. PCI, USB and in
this case SPI) to handle the fact that a bus has been
suspended or resumed. This means that when an adapter
gets a suspend/resume call the core layer must then
ask all the devices on that adapter to suspend/resume.
In platform.c there are 3 calls made to the suspend
resume function which I assumed was the standard why
of doing this as some devices might have to be called
3 times inorder to be suspended/resumed correctly.
I can see that you could have a situation where a SPI
device has been suspended, and then the bus gets
suspended and then resumed, in which case I guess that
SPI device should probably still be suspended but at
the moment would get resumed.
