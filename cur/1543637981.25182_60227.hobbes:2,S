Try plugins for Photoshop.  Or think of it as being like VFS but more 
so.  You can add good features or bad features, but being able to add 
features with fewer lines of code per feature is a plus.
Oses that do not mutate go extinct.  I don't expect any of this to 
convince you though.  People who don't like change are not swayable by 
argument for the most part.
