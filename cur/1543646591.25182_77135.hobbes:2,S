The structure length does *not* include the string data, so we could pass the length test and still run of the table in dmi_string. What's more, the string index could be more that the string count for this structure and no check is done for this.

Then, the other checks (white space and null byte) will be obsolete.
Oh as a PS btw don't worry about code size for the dmi scanner as it is
all marked __init. The entire DMI code gets turned back into free memory
by the end of the boot of the kernel, so you can put complex checks in
there if it helps
