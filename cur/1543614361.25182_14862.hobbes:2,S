Guys, doing this in the correct way is not difficult, just we need glibc
cooperation. The module ( app or sl ) will have a table of system call
mappings :
unsinged sysmap[];
and it'll know that sys_getpid is entry 0, etc... ( static knowledge ).
When invoking sys_getpid it'll load the syscall # register with sysmap[0]
and then it'll invoke the syscall entry. Current system call will retain
their current #ID and this will provide backward compatibility.
The table is filled at module initialization time by calling ( for
performance reasons ) a fixed #ID system call sys_namemap(), that will use
an internal hashed map of system names to #ID, and will return the #ID
given a system call name. If the module require a system call that it's
not present inside the loading kernel, it'll fail the module load.
glibc ver >= N will require kernel ver >= M ( that will have the
sys_namemap() function ). System call names should be placed in a special
gcc section where they can be easily looped at init time to fill the
sysmap[] table. Where does it break ?
