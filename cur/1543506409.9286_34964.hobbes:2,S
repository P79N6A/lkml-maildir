   Following `bit', `byte' and `nybble' there have been quite a few
   analogical attempts to construct unambiguous terms for bit blocks
   of other sizes.
     16 bits:
          playte, {chawmp} (on a 32-bit machine), word (on a 16-bit
          machine), half-word (on a 32-bit machine).
     32 bits:
          dynner, {gawble} (on a 32-bit machine), word (on a 32-bit
          machine), longword (on a 16-bit machine).

I note that there is no definition for 64 bits in Jargon 4.0, so how about
feyst?  Banqyet crossed my mind, but readb already means byte.
So readb, readp, readd and readf for byte, two bytes, four bytes and
eight bytes respectively.
Alternatively, Sun used `hyper' to represent an 8-byte quantity in the
RPC specification.  But readh might be confused with halfword.
What's wrong with read1, read2, read4 and read8 anyway?
