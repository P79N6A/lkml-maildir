This reminds me...
Someone needs to go through ALSA and audit all delays executed via 
$FOO_interruptible().
Several delays within ALSA wait for hardware conditions, and do not 
check for signals pending, which means that the wait-for-condition loop 
becomes a busy loop:
	while (1) {
		foo = read_hardware()
		if (foo & interesting_bits)
			break;
		schedule_timeout_interruptible(1);
	}
The proper fix is (a) remove "_interruptible" [recommended] or (b) check 
for signals.
grep'ing for "_interruptible" quickly finds several such ALSA bugs.
