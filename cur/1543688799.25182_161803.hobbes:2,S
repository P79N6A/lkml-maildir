the only difference I believe is that the connections are originated by
my end, but that only changes the syn packet that normally accounts for
a non significant amount of the bandwidth. And while this is located in
a house, this isn't what I would call an home user usage.

on the long run, the way I recommend you to act, is to have a script
that turns the traffic shaping on on demand before/after using voip, so
you won't hurt the bkbits.net userbase when you're not at the phone. So
you will fix the unprofessional thing during conf calls completely and
the community should be ok with reasonably short slowdowns while you're
at the phone (if only voip would run under linux too you could automate it).
Just try for a test with my script changing it to give 1kbyte/sec both
ways (not 64k/16k) to everything but voip. I think I already posted all
the needed information you need to make it work. You will need to rework
the iptables rules carefully though, to include all the traffic but voip.
Hope this helps you too (I couldn't live without it),
Andrea
