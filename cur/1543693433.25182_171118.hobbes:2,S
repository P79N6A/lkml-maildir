Subject: calling devinet_ioctl from a kernel module

Hello all,
I'm experiencing a kernel panic in RedHat Linux 8.0 with 2.4.20 kernel 
when calling the function devinet_ioctl() with the SIOCSIFADDR command 
from within a kernel module.  The function is called within the scope of
userspace addressing in the following manner.
int res;
mm_segment_t oldfs = get_fs();
set_fs(get_ds());
res = devinet_ioctl(cmd,arg);
set_fs(oldfs);
This is how ipconfig.c illustrates how to use this function from within 
a kernel module, see ic_dev_ioctl() function in the source file.
When running in the scope of a kgdb patched kernel, I see the kernel 
panic when this function is called from within my kernel module. The 
panic happens because alloc_skb is being called non-atomically from an 
interrupt.
Is there anything grossly wrong that I am doing? Am I supposed to do 
something else before calling this function?
Thanks,
Vishwas.
