=================================================
We have a number of machines with identical dual PPro 200 mainboards. They all
run fine on 2.2.13 kernels. Trying 2.4.18,2.4.19,2.4.20-pre7 and even 2.2.19, 
the same problem shows up:
With SMP activated in the kernel, I get the boot-messages
---------
PCI: PCI BIOS revision 2.10 entry at 0xfb0a0, last bus=0
PCI: Using configuration type 1
PCI: Probing PCI hardware
PCI BIOS passed nonexistent PCI bus 0!
PCI BIOS passed nonexistent PCI bus 0!
Limiting direct PCI/PCI transfers.
---------
Afterwards, everything runs fine, except that PCI seems to be only half-way
functional: network-cards don't give any error messages but behave just
as if the cable was disconnected scsi-cards give strange errors (don't recall
what exactly)
With SMP disabled in the kernel, everything works just fine.

Can you try to boot 486-optimized kernel?
Can you remove one CPU and run SMP kernel on UP configuration?
