No, the MTD interface isn't flawed.  gluebi is present to make things like
JFFS2 work on top of UBI volumes with very little adaptations.  If you go
changing _every_ MTD user to now use either an MTD device or a native UBI
device, then the code for those users just gets bloated.

Assuming your SD card isn't doing wear-leveling itself within the device,
yes that is what you would get.  Or you could do something slightly more sane
and use:
1. MMC
2. block2mtd
3. JFFS2

This could perhaps still be done.  UBI has a general concept of an io_unit
so theoretically it could be adapted to work with the block layer in the
kernel.
