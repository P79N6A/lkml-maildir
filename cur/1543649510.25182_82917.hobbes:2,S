I guess this is what __down_failed means.

Ok, I'll keep that in mind.

Great! This is what I was searching for.
When I build with "make -k EXTRA_CFLAGS=-g EXTRA_LDFLAGS=-g bzImage",
I get a ton of error messages from drivers/acpi/include/actypes.h and
other acpi related stuff, starting with: #error ACPI_MACHINE_WIDTH not
defined. Maybe this is not the usual way to build with -g, but I don't
get these errors with "make -k bzImage". Maybe someone is interested
in this.
Anyway, I come around this by first building with "EXTRA_CFLAGS=-g
EXTRA_LDFLAGS=-g", ignoring the error messages and then a second try
with only EXTRA_LDFLAGS=-g.
Regards, Olaf.
