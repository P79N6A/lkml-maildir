These patches clash badly with Michael Ludvig's work:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.11-rc2/2.6.11-rc2-mm1/broken-out/cryptoapi-prepare-for-processing-multiple-buffers-at.patch
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.11-rc2/2.6.11-rc2-mm1/broken-out/cryptoapi-update-padlock-to-process-multiple-blocks-at.patch
so someone's going to have to rework things.  Ordinarily Michael would go
first due to test coverage.
James, your call please.  Also, please advise on the suitability of
Michael's patches for a 2.6.11 merge.
Thanks.
