Yeah, for a big pull, the server will have to think about the objects it 
is going to send you.

Actually, the really irritating thing is that we actually generate all 
these nice status updates, which just makes pulling and cloning a lot more 
comfortable, because you actually see what is going on, and what to 
expect. 
Except they only work over ssh, where we have a separate channel (for 
stderr), and with the native git protocol all that nice status work just 
gets flushed to /dev/null :(
Dang. It's literally the most irritating part of the thing: the protocol 
itself is exactly the same whether you go over ssh:// or over git://, but 
that visual information about what is going on is missing, and it's 
surprisingly important from a usability standpoint.
And in your case, the usability downside actually turned into a real 
accessibility bug.
Oh, well.
