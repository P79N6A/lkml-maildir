This comment, describing how to optimize for gcc-2.2.2, is so outdated
it should be removed. It's also quite doubtful it should ever have been
placed in this file at all (perhaps something under Documentation/ ?).
This patch removes it.
Against 2.5.19.
Cheers,
Bill

- * The way to optimize jumps for gcc-2.2.2 is to:

- *  - no else-statements if you can avoid them

- * With the above two rules, you get a straight-line execution path
