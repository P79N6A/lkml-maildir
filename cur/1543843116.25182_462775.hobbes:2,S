yes, it would be there, but is not heavy, IMO.

hmm, when you provide QoS for a set of apps, you will affect (the
resource availability of) other apps. I don't see any way around it. Any
ideas ?

Then you will not be work-conserving (IOW over-committing), which is one
of the main advantage of this type of feature.
