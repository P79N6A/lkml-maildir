Hah - this isn't documented anywhere nicely, it seems. I looked for ages
for a conf.modules guide but never found one, and then banged my head till
I had one that worked with my hardware. I'll do a writeup of a basic
guide, but not right now.

Tightly? Ugh, redhat. Well, you should have a look in your 'rc' files. One
problem you might run into is that redhat (at least what I've seen) might
not be running depmod -a (and ldconfig, but that another matter) on
bootup.
You should have no problem, really, don't mind Redhat's nonsense, just
make modules, modules_install and depmod -a. Then you can try modprobing
stuff, and if it's working, move on to getting conf.modules ready for
kmod.
