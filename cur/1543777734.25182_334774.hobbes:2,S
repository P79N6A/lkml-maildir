By the way, the front socket that dislikes the USB 2.0 flashdisk (ehci) feels 
perfectly happy if I plug and USB 1.1 flashdisk (uhci)... Feels good also if 
I plug my Digital Camera there... And I've plugged it there thousands of 
times.
Some posts I googled about this kind of errors tend to indicate this would be 
an IRQ mess ;-))
