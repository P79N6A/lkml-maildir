Hi Ingo, all
While messing with the interactivity code I found what appears to be an 
uninitialised variable (p->sleep_avg), which is responsible for all the 
boost/penalty in the scheduler. Initialising this variable to 0 seems to have 
made absolutely massive improvements to system responsiveness under load
and completely removed audio skips up to doing a make -j64 on my uniprocessor 
P4 (beyond which swap starts being used), without changing the scheduler 
timeslices. This seems to help all 2.4 O(1) based kernels as well. Attached 
is a patch against 2.5.72 but I'm not sure about the best place to initialise 
it.

I hope this is correct.
