If the panic backtrace is to be believed, that's the address of mcount
(arch/x86_64/kernel/entry.S). 
The code 0x15 at the end of the segfault message means (according to the
comment in fault.c) that the segfault is the result of a user-mode
protection fault while reading the address ffffffff8010fadc.
