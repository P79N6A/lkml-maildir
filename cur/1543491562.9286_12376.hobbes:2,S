Since i moved from 2.0.36 to 2.2.5 the kernel fails to boot saying:
Partition check:
sda: sda1 sda2 <sda5 sda6 sda7 sda8>
Kernel Panic: VFS: Unable to mount root FS on 08:01
and halts...
it happens the same thing with 2.2.4
but not with 2.0.36
the computer is a Dell Poweredge 2300/350
With an adaptec aic-7890 and a aic-7860
and has a seagate st39173lc ultra-2 lvd connected to the aic-7890 and
a nec cdrom 485 connected to the aic-78960
PS: The ext2fs module is static linked in the kernel...
