Exactly. However, inactivity can be construed as lack of knowledge that 
something is occurring. (ie: the RIAA didn't start acting on file-sharing 
until they became aware of Napster)
But for said estoppel to not be a factor you will have to prosecute and/or 
file suit on all instances of the activity. (And filing a suit and then 
dropping it against some of the people that you filed suit against - ie: you 
file suit against persons A and B and then drop the suit against person A in 
its entirety - because you only wanted to prosecute person B for the action, 
you are leaving yourself open to lawsuits on a number of counts.)
