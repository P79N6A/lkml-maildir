For the record, the kgcc "mess" you speak of was used by
Conectiva, and I believe also by debian before adoption in Red
Hat Linux.  It was about as good a solution as one could get for
the problem that it solved - the kernel being broken and unable
to build with our gcc-2.96.  Just to head anyone off at the
pass... the kernel is fixed and now builds properly with
gcc-2.96.  Also, if anyone has any questions about gcc-2.96
please see:
