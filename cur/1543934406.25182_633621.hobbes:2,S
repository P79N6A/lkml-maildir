Except SLOB's emulation of slabs is so thin, it doesn't have the
relevant information. We have a very small struct kmem_cache, which I
suppose could contain a counter. But we don't have anything like the
kmalloc slabs, so you'd only be getting half the picture anyway.
The output of slabtop would simply be misleading because there are no
underlying "slabs" in the first place.
