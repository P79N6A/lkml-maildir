OK, thanks.

This is a blockdev which was under mmap(), yes?  No, I haven't looked at
that yet.  It'll be a matter of just killing the warning.
mmapping a blockdev is a pretty dopey thing to do, btw.  It doesn't
allow the use of highmem, the IO uses tiny BIOs (in fact I think
it uses 512-byte or 1k blocksize too) and there are buffer_heads
all over the place.  You'll get better results from mmapping a
regular file.

I missed one there.
