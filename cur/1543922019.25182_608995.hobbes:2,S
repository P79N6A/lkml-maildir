agreed, we need to be reporting idle time in (milli)seconds, although
the requirement we had was to report it back in percentage. I guess the
percentage figure can be derived from the raw idle time number.
How about:
	idle time = t4-t3 (effectively sleep time)
in the above example?

I don't see how the idle time metric defined above (t4-t3) can be
affected by other cgroup activity, unless the execution pattern of one
cgroup is dependent on the others.
However the minute you tranlsate this idle time into a percentage wrt
wall-clock time, then yes a cgroup's idle percentage can be affected by
others. For idle percentage to be meaningfull, I would imagine that
user-space tools will need to calculate it after discarding a group's
wait time.

I think primarily for systems management tools to report back various
statistics about a OpenVZ/VServer-like container (just like top reports stats 
for a OS currently). Let me check if there are other uses envisoned for
it.
