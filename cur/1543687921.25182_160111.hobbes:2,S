I didn't follow the whole discussion. But from what wli has described to 
me, the problem (xmms skips frames) is pretty like a X scheduler problem.
X server works like this:
 "The X server uses select(2) to detect clients with pending input. Once 
the set of clients with pending input is determined, the X server starts 
executing requests from the client with the smallest file descriptor. 
Each client has a buffer which is used to read some data from the 
network connection, that buffer can be resized to hold unusually large 
requests, but is typically 4KB. Requests are executed from each client 
until either the buffer is exhausted of complete requests or after ten 
requests. After requests are read from all of the ready clients, the 
server determines whether any clients still have complete requests in 
their buffers. If so, the server foregoes the select(2) call and goes 
back to processing requests for those clients. When all client input 
buffers are exhausted of complete requests, the X server returns to 
select(2) to await additional data. "
--- Keith Packard, "Efficiently Scheduling {X} Clients",  FREENIX-00,
Basically, the X server does a round robin for all the clients with 
pending input.  It's not surprising that xmms skip frames when there are 
a lot of "heavy" x requests pending.  I am not sure if this the cause of 
the problem that you guys are talking about.  But anyway, if this the 
cause, here is my 2 cents:
I think the scheduler of X server has to be "smarter". It has to know 
which X client is more "important" and give the important client a high 
priority, otherwise the  priority inversion problem will be 
un-avoidable.  Suppose the system can provide something like 
"get_most_important_client()" , the X server can be fixed this way:
The X server calls get_most_important_client() before it starts to 
handle an X request. If the return is not NULL, it handles the request 
from this "important" client.  This way, an "important" x client only 
need to wait a maximun of a single X request (instead of unlimited 
number of X requests) to get served.
The problem now is how can we decide which X client is the most 
important?  Well, I guess there are a lot of solutions. I have a kernel 
based solution to this question.    The basic idea is: keep the 
processes blocked by X server in the runqueue. If a certain process (P) 
of this kind is scheduled, the kernel switch to the X server instead. If 
the X server get scheduled in this way, it can handle the X requests 
from this very process (P). If you have interest, you can take a look
