So, should I upgrade to 2.96 from 2.95.3?
But, from 
http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-2.96.html
 ...
   Please note that both GCC 2.96 and 2.97 are development versions; we
   do not recommend using them for production purposes. Binaries built
   using any version of GCC 2.96 or 2.97 will not be portable to systems
   based on one of our regular releases.
Does this still hold?
Thanks,
Jeff
