I just checked the AMD K6-2 Processor Data Sheet.  It states the following
bits in CR4 being used:
    0 - VME  (Virtual-8086 Mode Extensions)
    1 - PVI  (Protected Virtual Interrupts)
    2 - TSD  (Time Stamp Disable)
    3 - DE   (Debugging Extensions)
    4 - PSE  (Page Size Extensions)
    5 - reserved
    6 - MCE  (Machine Check Enable)
    7 - reserved
    ...
   31 - reserved
Then there is the Extended Feature Enable Register (EFER, ECX=0xc0000080):
    0 - SCE  (System Call Extension)
    1 - DPE  (Data Prefetch Enable)
  2/3 - EWBEC (EWBE Control)
    4 - reserved
    ...
   63 - reserved
And also the Processor State Observability Register (PSOR, ECX=0xc0000087):
  0-2 - BF   (Bus Frequency divisor) -> THERE ARE K6-2 with 66MHz FRONTSIDE BUS!
    3 - reserved
  4-7 - STEP (Processor Stepping)
    8 - NOL2 (No L2 Functionality)   
    9 - reserved
    ...
   63 - reserved
But no bit 10 in CR4...
Yours,
  Dominik Kubla
