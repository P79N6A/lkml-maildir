i have no quick ideas - the behavior you are seeing is quite unexpected.
Could you try the current sched-devel code:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/cfs-scheduler/devel/sched-devel-combo-v2.6.23.patch
since this version of CFS does various things differently then the one 
in v2.6.23, lets see whether perturbing it makes any difference to your 
throughput.
you could also try the scheduler backport to v2.6.22.10, at:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/cfs-scheduler/
that would establish whether it's the changes in scheduling that cause 
this or something else. Plus please enable CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG and 
CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS and run this debug script while such a transfer is 
going on:
  
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/cfs-scheduler/tools/cfs-debug-info.sh
and send me the resulting file.
