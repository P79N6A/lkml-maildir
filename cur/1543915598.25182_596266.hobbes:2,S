Hi Xu,
   As far we have worked on it, the parameter to be passed is
"root=/dev/ram" and not "root=/dev/ram0". Atleast I used it to boot
the kernel on a U-Boot boot loader.
  I guess I can help you out. But I will need more details. But I
would like you to try "root=/dev/ram" first and let me know if its
working.
Midhun.
