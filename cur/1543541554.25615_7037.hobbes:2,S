Initialized variables (even explicitly initialized to zero) still go into
the data segment, which shows up in the executable file intact. This just
increases the size of the kernel file (not the running kernel's memory use)
for no reason I can see.

Not initializing in that case is a bug, yes. This just papers over it, and
makes it _harder_ to find the bug if the #define someday changes (it is
easier to realize that the initialization is missing than to figure out
_why_ it is wrong).
