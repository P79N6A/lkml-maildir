Ever since going to 2.6.12 I also have random hangs with my fileserver.
I've got a
   Bus  0, device   6, function  0:
     Unknown mass storage controller: Promise Technology, Inc. 20269 
(rev 2).
       IRQ 17.
       Master Capable.  Latency=32.  Min Gnt=4.Max Lat=18.
       I/O at 0xec00 [0xec07].
       I/O at 0xe800 [0xe803].
       I/O at 0xe400 [0xe407].
       I/O at 0xe000 [0xe003].
       I/O at 0xdc00 [0xdc0f].
       Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xdfffc000 [0xdfffffff].
in the box.
Since I do not have a serial cable attached I dont have the panic 
output. But iirc it crashes somewhere in an interrupt handler 
complaining about damaged pagetables (thats why I thought it was bad 
memory). But it takes about 3 days for the machine to hang (and I'm 
happily using all the memory and have high disk i/o in the meantime).
I'll go and replace the memory but perhaps there really is a bug in the 
driver.
kind regards Philip
