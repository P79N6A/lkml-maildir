Would sgdt not be sufficient?  I agree that we will have to end up
giving RO access to user for the gdt page.

Yes they can map using /proc/cpuinfo.  But if there is any easier
mechanism then using /proc then that would help.  
I agree that we should not overload a single call (though cpu, package
and node numbers do belong in one category IMO).  We can have multiple
calls if that is required as long as there is an efficient mechanism to
provide that information.

Why maintain that extra logic in user space when kernel can easily give
that information.

This is an excellent point.

Can you please tell me what more information you are thinking of putting
in aux vector?

You are absolutely right that the mechanism I'm proposing makes sense
only if we have more fields AND if any of those fields are dynamically
changing.  But this is a generic mechanism that could be extended to
share any user visible information in efficient way.  Once we have this
in place then information like whole cpuinfo, percpu interrupts etc. can
be retrieved easily.
