The point is that I can't see a swap `region' looking at how
scan_swap_map() works. The more atomic region I can see in the swap space
is a block of bytes large PAGE_SIZE bytes (e.g. offset ;).
For the case of binaries the aging on the page cache should take care of
it (even if there's no aging on the swap cache as pre[567] if I remeber
well).
