Three more assorted nfsd patches.
The last is somewhat embarassing... a previous patch completely left out the
nfsv2 section.  This didn't cause compile errors, but completely broke
NFSv2 service... and it was in -mm for at least a month with noone noticing.
 [PATCH kNFSd 001 of 3] semaphore to mutex conversion.
 [PATCH kNFSd 002 of 3] Fix some more errno/nfserr confusion in vfs.c
 [PATCH kNFSd 003 of 3] Provide missing NFSv2 part of patch for checking vfs_getattr.
