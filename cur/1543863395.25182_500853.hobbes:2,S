Yes, it does for me. So to sum up, I apply your patch to 2.4.34.1
and it restores the same behaviour for Santiago and Grant as they get
in 2.6. Whether it's the expected behaviour or not is not the point,
as it will be easier for us to later mimic 2.6 if a change is needed
since we're not experts at all in this area.
If we're all OK for this, I'll go with that.
Thanks guys,
Willy
