I thought that getting rid of the separate versions of proc_exe_link()
improved maintainability. Do you have any specific details on what you
think makes the code introduced by the patch unmaintainable?

Yup -- looking at how the VM_EXECUTABLE flag affects the vma walk it's
clear one of my arguments was wrong. So I can't blame you for being
unconvinced by that. :)
I still think it would help any stacking filesystems that can't use the
solution adopted by unionfs.

Yup.

	I'm not completely certain that I understand your point. Are you
suggesting that some hypothetical code would want to use this "quirk"
of /proc/pid/exe for a legitimate purpose?
	Assuming that is your point, I thought my non-hypothetical java example
clearly demonstrated that at least one non-hypothetical program doesn't
expect the "quirk" and breaks because of it. Frankly,
given /proc/pid/exe's output in the non-stacking case, I can't see how
its output in the stacking case we're discussing could be considered
anything but buggy.
