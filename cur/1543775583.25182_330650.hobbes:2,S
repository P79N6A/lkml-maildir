Well, although I've never used udev because I've been using sort of an
equivalent called "preinit" for 4 years now, I don't totally agree with
you about the firmware upgrade : when you package your systems to allow
the customer to perform "firmware" upgrades, your image is already very
specific to a hardware model, and I don't see why you would need to
create /dev entries independantly from the kernel or rootfs. Speaking
for myself, my .preinit script which describes how to fill /dev entries
is on the rootfs and does not need to change once packaged.
However, I agree that I encountered difficulties using this system on
more generic hardware, because sometimes the raid devices did not exist,
or things like this caused trouble.
IMHO, a generic system should use a full /dev directory and an embedded
system should use just the strict minimum necessary for the specific
hardware to run.

I think something went wrong, perhaps something like
   # some_prog >/dev/null 
while null did not exist. My /dev is a tmpfs too, but mounted with size=0,
so that I can only create inodes into it, but cannot write any data. One
other advantage of using size=0 is that "df" does not show it by default.
Cheers,
Willy
