Sure I see that, and that's also allowed by the new initrd API, and in
such case you cannot make use of the two rootfs* params anyways because
as you say you don't know what the wanted partitioning in advance.
What i'm saying is that if you want to add notail option to the root
mount after you finished installing your system (so with a normally non
interactive initrd) you can't make use of the rootfs* parameters to
tweak the root mount during lilo (like you could do without initrd)
because they're applied to both initrd and real root dev and that's
clearly another bug (but not very important). And with the new initrd
API such bug basically doesn't matter because the rootfstype will be
forced in the static initrd image (while without initrd, or with the old
initrd API + the bugfix that applies rootfs* only to the root dev I
could make use of the rootfs* flags).
