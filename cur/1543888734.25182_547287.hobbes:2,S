Luc figured it out then, Keith made it work for things that aren't
unichrome and spent the time getting the interfaces into the X
server..

Yup please do, we are doing something seriously different to what you
were trying to do at the time, as we have the experience of the randr
work which demonstrated a path forward rather than trying to strive
for the end...

These people are free to implement these features, we are doing
nothing to block any of these things from happening, but we are not
going to write a userspace console until such time as having a
userspace console becomes useful, whereas we are enabling someone else
to write one on top of the drm now....
We are not going to write a multi-head setup for someone but we are
enabling the setting up of one using the graphics drivers that support
it, we aren't going to enable every driver at once but allow others to
move things over as they like,
The reason this stuff is mainly ending up in the drm is separating the
modesetting from the memory management is definitely not a good plan
and drm has the memory management code now...
We also have VGA arbitration to worry about but again this is
"orthogonal" to the problem space we are currently trying to fix which
is just that we need to suspend/resume GPUs properly and set modes on
multiple output/crtc combos from the kernel.
