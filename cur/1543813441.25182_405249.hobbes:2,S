Oops.
This was inside of spin_lock in old my patch.
But, it is moved out from spin_lock as a result of refactoring 
and I didn't notice that.
Yes. GFP_KERNEL is better.

Kmalloc_node() will not work well at here, 
because this patch is to initialize structures for new node -itself-.
It will work after that completion of initalize pgdat and wait_table.
To use new node's memory at here, other consideration will be necessary. 
But, I would like to use kmalloc() to simplify my patch at this time.
Thanks.
