Please fix Xen to match include/linux/cpumask.h documentation that says :
/*
  * The following particular system cpumasks and operations manage
  * possible, present and online cpus.  Each of them is a fixed size
  * bitmap of size NR_CPUS.
  *
  *  #ifdef CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU
  *     cpu_possible_map - all NR_CPUS bits set
  *     cpu_present_map  - has bit 'cpu' set iff cpu is populated
  *     cpu_online_map   - has bit 'cpu' set iff cpu available to scheduler
  *  #else
  *     cpu_possible_map - has bit 'cpu' set iff cpu is populated
  *     cpu_present_map  - copy of cpu_possible_map
  *     cpu_online_map   - has bit 'cpu' set iff cpu available to scheduler
  *  #endif
