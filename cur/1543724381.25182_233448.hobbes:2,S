I agree, when you're talking about the `if ((x = f())' cases. We already added
the extra parentheses to shut up gcc...

Sparse also found the following for me:
  - #if NEVER_DEFINED_DEFINE
  - `return f();' in a function returning void (where f() returns void as well)
  - `retval k_and_r_func(/* missing void */) { ... }'
  - `extern' keywords at function definition
  - inline functions used before definition
  - const pointer assigned to non-const pointer (strange, because usually gcc
    tells me as well)
  - `if (x &= mask)' instead of `if (x & mask)'
  - floating point constants assigned to integers
  - `struct x { .field initializer };' (i.e. missing `=')
BTW, the hardest part is adding the __user annotations and making sure
<asm/uaccess.h> does it right (speaking about macros).

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
