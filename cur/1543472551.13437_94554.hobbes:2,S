Actually, its about $25K for a good US lawyer per patent. Probably
much less when not using some over-payed corpoprate lawyer.
I've been told (more or less) by US patent laywer that for $25K, you
can more or less patent anything.... (you just make it look different
to things that have come before, whether or not it really is).

I have -- I know several people with patents, only one has made money
from it, enough in fact to allow them to hack around all day instead
of getting a real job (it also supports their spouse and kids to some
extent too I believe).

Yes. People who do IPOs often look for patents to give their company
some 'added value', "even if the patent is worthless"

There are worse patents out there -- one for tuning a 1 bit into a 0
bit, and also one for the converse. You can lease this for 0.10 cyber
dollars per bit on the web somewhere.

It only moves the goalpost -- hardware and software algorithms are
becoming a very fine line (eg. FPGAs).

No they won't -- they make money from patents. Presumably the more
patents they see, the more they make.
