No. foo is not visible. While looking for a file in a union mounted
directory, the lookup starts from the topmost directory and proceeds
downwards if the file isn't present the top layers. If a whiteout is
found in any of the top layers, the lookup is abondoned and -ENOENT
is removed. Thus until a whiteout exists in any upper layer for
a corresponding file in the lower layer, the lower layer file remains
hidden until the whiteout is removed.
However in the case of dir-c containing foo, the foo(from dir-c) will become
visible after union mounting dir-c on top of dir-b and dir-a.

Bharata.
