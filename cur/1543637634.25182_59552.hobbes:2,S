Dell provides our OpenManage Server Administrator software which does this.
http://www.dell.com/openmanage/
 has the marketing info.
OMSA version 1.1.0 is the latest released, and is available on
support.dell.com (this URL requires cookies - you can search for R43374 on
support.dell.com and find it too).

You'll probably find our public mailing list Linux-PowerEdge@dell.com
(subscribe, read archvies at

) helpful.
Thanks,
Matt
