The original post was referring to RAID 1; there's no repair necessary at the RAID level to give fsck the correct data. Seems to me the basic problem here is that the RAID re-sync is supposed to be throttling back to allow other activity to run, but that in the case of fsck the other activity is still slower by a large factor (compared to no RAID re-sync).
Is this a pathological case because of the way fsck does business, or does the RAID re-sync affect any disk-bound process that severely?
