So you are currently not protecting this access vector and it was said 
pretty clearly that this patch wouldn't make it into mainline. I don't 
understand how you intend to address this. Are people running different 
distros out of luck with regard to Apparmor?

Thats fine, what about private namespaces, which are better than chroots 
anyway in terms of flexibility. Are you going to be able to specify the 
precise namespace that an app may use in order to use these policies?
By the way, the fact that there is such a rule in the policy isn't the 
problem, its a symptom of the problem. All of these 'fixes' seem to be 
band-aiding the symptoms. Aren't these alot of hoops to jump through for 
the sake of using paths?
