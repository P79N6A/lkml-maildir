How about instead: "attempts to register a child device below a

It gets used in only a couple of places, so nobody should object too 
violently.  :-)

No; this would repeat the same mistake we were struggling with last
week.  Blocking registration attempts (especially if we start _before_
calling the device's suspend method or end _after_ calling the resume
method) will lead to deadlocks while suspending or resuming.
If the blocking starts after the suspend method returns then it will be 
safer.  But what's the point?  If a registration attempt is made at 
that stage, it means there's a bug in the driver.  So failing the 
registration seems like a reasonable thing to do.
One issue: This rule doesn't allow suspend_late or resume_early methods
to register any new devices.  Will that cause problems with the CPU
hotplug or ACPI subsystems?  ACPI in particular may need to freeze the
kacpi_notify workqueue -- in fact, that might solve the problem in
Bugzilla #9874.

I agree.  But there aren't any -EPOWER* or -EPM* error codes defined!  
Some should be added, but this patch isn't the place to do it.

That may be true.  But this is an error-recovery path intended to work
around a driver bug.  It doesn't have to guarantee perfect operation, 
just do its best.
Remember too that the target state is set before any devices are
suspended.  Hence, after the state is set there may still be runtime
resumes taking place.  Those _must_ not fail, which means that this
resume ought to work also.

Me too.  But until the API is changed, this seems to be the best we can 
do.  It's not quite as bad as it looks, since a fair amount of the new 
code is just for reporting on and recovering from bugs in drivers.
