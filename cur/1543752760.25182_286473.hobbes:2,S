The closest thing to concensus I've seen yet was a new rlimit for
scheduling with code from Chris Wright. The version I last saw had
some rough edges on the API (exposing the internal scheduler priority
levels) but wasn't too bad in principle. We really ought not get in
the habit of adding new rlimits though.
Perhaps he can post whatever he has again, I'm not sure what the
current state is.
