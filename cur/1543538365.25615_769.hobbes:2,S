It's a bit more subtle than that. I've talked a bit about that with
the university professor who taught an intellectual property course
for engineering students and algorithms and mathematic stuff as such
is not patentable. In combination with a physical device it is. So in
his opinion, according to Belgian law, Unisys wouldn't have gotten a
patent on LZW compressing, but they could have gotten a patent on the
application of LZW for communication through a telephone line, i.e. in
modem application.
