I agree with you that the functionality is there. However, both the
PPP driver and pppd have been written and documented in a way that
means, as we both agree, that makes it hard or impossible to figure
out the dependencies without hunting through the source code. I
suspect that they are not alone in that trait. A tool like modprobe is
not particularly useful if you can't figure out what to tell it.
