I've been testing all your scheduler versions since first one.
Ok, now I made comparison test with exactly same kernel except other one
with -K2 patch. O1-K2 behaves significantly worse than old scheduler. I
think this behaviour was introduced somewhere around beginning of -J series.
I can't make kernel with old scheduler loose datablocks, but with O1 it
looses large percentage of the blocks.
