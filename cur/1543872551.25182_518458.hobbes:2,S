Yeah.  And if we can't use something else all the missing functions
should be in a compat-solaris.c files, similarly to how sparse handles
missing functions on various systems instead of polluting implementation
files with ifdefs and duplicates of library code.

It's not though.  It's a gccisms, and I'm not sure we want to mandate
gcc for the host copiler, given that the only way you'd build a working
kernel on a foreign system would be a cross compilation anyway.

Except that solaris curses doesn't actually understand this random
value for KEY_RESIZE.  Either we mandate that ncurses is installed on
the host for menuconfig to work (and ncurses at least used to work
on most unix variants), or some needs to do a proper curses port.
