That's my driver.  I put a lot of fixes in for 2.6.17, one of which changes
the setup of the chip type used in this machine. The driver is significantly
changed from 2.6.16 so best bet is to just take the 2.6.17 latest version
and compile it on 2.6.16 (or update to 2.6.17). I got reports from Fujitsu E610
user that it now works fine.
Unfortunately, I don't have the hardware (or full specs for the chip) used
in that machine.  Maybe I need to get a MacBook.
