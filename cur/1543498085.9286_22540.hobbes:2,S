The oopses from out of memory (replicated below) seems to have be caused by
IKD.  I had CONFIG_DEBUG_SOFTLOCKUP, CONFIG_NMI_WATCHDOG, and
CONFIG_SEMAPHORE_DEADLOCK set at the time. (2.2.7 + ikd from Andrea)  In my
non-kernel-trained eye, it appears to just be due to being out of memory
taking too long:
+Semapahore deadlock detector
+CONFIG_SEMAPHORE_DEADLOCK
+  With this option enabled the first down() that will block for more than
+  20 sec will generate an Oops that will allow you to know the code path
+  that deadlocked.
So if one process is stuck for 20 sec due to the system being otherwise
detained trying to kill something, these would result.
