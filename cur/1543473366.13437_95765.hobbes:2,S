I am using 2.2.0-pre1 compiled with:
andrea@laser:~$ egcc -v
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/egcs-2.91.58/specs
gcc version egcs-2.91.58 19981101 (egcs-1.1.1 pre-release 2, Debian 2.1)
with s/-m486/-mpentiumpro/ and SMP works fine here.
But the:
                if (current->need_resched) {
                        schedule();
#if 0
                        check_pgt_cache();
#endif
                }
still seems to cause a bit of slowdown (instead of improve things as it
should) sigh. I changed it to: 
                if (1||current->need_resched) {
                        schedule();
#if 0
                        check_pgt_cache();
#endif
                }
and the benchmark as usual told me that the old version is faster...
Can you confirm this?
And, is there some reason to left the check_pgt_cache() in the idle task
and not in vmscan.c as with kmem_cache_reap()?
