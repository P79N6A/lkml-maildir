The RTC historically used to have a lower quality (cheaper) crystal than
the 14.318 MHz crystal used for everything else. But with the spread
spectrum modulation of frequency, the PIT may finally be worse to
consider the RTC again.
Another BIG problem with RTC is that it doesn't allow reading its
internal counter like the PIT does, making TSC interpolation even harder.
