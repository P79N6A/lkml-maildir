First of all, thanks for this interesting work you are doing.  Pre-emptive
bug squashing is great.  Probably saved many man-years of grief for people
who are having intermittent problems, or have uncommon hardware/configuration.

It appears you are not making a distinction between static functions and
global functions.  The parse_options function is local to ext2, but since
many filesystem writers look at ext2 for guidance, they often have functions
with similar names.  It looks like parse_options is one of the common ones.
That said, I'm guessing the 1 time the return value isn't checked is a bug.
It appears to be in fs/proc/inode.c, and the parse_options() there _does_
return 1 on error (unknown mount option), so we _should_ probably fail
mounting /proc in that case.
Cheers, Andreas
