We can't compute the vector by reading the hardware registers after
we have acknowledged the irq.
I hope that was the answer you were looking for I'm not quite certain
what you mean by take.

I'm not quite certain what you are asking on the face of it there
is one bit per irq so it is impossible.
I don't think we can get into any trouble we don't let a vector be
reused on a cpu until we know it isn't in irr.  So even if things
come in highly out of order the should still function.
I also have seen irqs migrate on nearly every irq received.
