Aw, why go for boring? I think the solution is obvious:
0.x    Fairy
1.0.x  Emperor
1.1.x  Macaroni
1.2.x  Humboldt
1.3.x  Royal
2.0.x  King
2.1.x  Snares
2.2.x  Blackfoot
0.x is genus Eudyptula
x.0.x is genus Aptenodytes--note that we'll need something
new for 3.0
Devel kernels are Eudyptes
x.2.x (and, by extension, x.4.x) is genus Spheniscus
Maybe there's a better system for assigned the various
genii, but we have 17 to choose from--this should last us
into 4.0
