Hello again,
>>>Yep, look @ 
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/airo-linux/airo-linux/kernel/
I've now installed this driver and it has had no effect.  VNC still 
causes this lockup readily.  The symptoms are the same: alt-sysrq works, 
but the keyboard is frozen.  I can sync disks, but I can't reboot.
Hopefully this report will be better than the last; I'm running vanilla 
kernel 2.4.21-pre5 with the 'badram', 'debianlogo', 'lowlatency', and 
'preempt' patches.  My previous report of apparent success with the 
aux_bap=1 setting was flawed.  It failed as well.
The OOPS generally looks like this:
airo: BAP error 4000 2
Warning: kfree_skb passed an skb still on a list (from d0acb466)
kernel BUG at skbuff.c:315!
invalid operand: 0000
[...]
Call Trace:    [<d0acb466>] [<d0acb466>] [<c011d117>] [<c0105550>]
rebooting and running 'ksyms' for each of these gives:
d0ac8060: __insmod_airo_S.text_L43104
d0acb466
d0acba20: stop_airo_card
but nothing for the c0* addresses.  Further info is that I am using a 
Cisco 350 PCMCIA (PC-104/ISA) wireless card with the TxPower set to 20mW 
(14dB) and no encryption; running in managed mode.
I am also now subscribed to the LKML so I can see replies.  I've been 
told that the 2.4.19 driver works with 2.4.20 so I may try that next. 
That or the Cisco driver ...
Thanks for any help, and please Cc: me directly.
Christopher
