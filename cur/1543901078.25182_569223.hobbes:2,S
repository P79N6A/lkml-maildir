The devices should be quiesced and the state of devices should be saved
in kexec_jump, before relocate_kernel is called. This needs the
implementation of device hibernating as you mentioned before.

The mem_map (struct page[]) of every zone of hibernated kernel is
checked.  Necessary pages are saved, like memory snapshot of software
suspend, but in user space.

There is much similarity between sys_kexec_load and software resuming.
If resuming can be done by sys_kexec_load, then we need not two similar
functionality in kernel.
