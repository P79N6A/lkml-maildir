Subject: 2.5.69-70 ide-cd to guarantee fault-free CD/DVD burning experience?

Linux is setting new landmarks all the time. Linux 2.5 is taking CD/DVD
burning to whole new level by *guaranteeing* fault-free burning
experience. No more hassle with overburns, underruns, poorly supported
media, positioning errors, power calibration failures, you name it...
It just works [by keeping the user-land totally unaware of errors
conditions raised by the logical unit]. Welcome to the future:-)
Well, I'm probably pushing this joke too far:-) In such case accept the
apologies along with this patch which makes it possible to access the
sense data returned by IDE CD/DVD units from user-land with SG_IO ioctl.
As for the last part, req->data?req->data:req->buffer. I'm not sure if
it's "the right thing(tm)" to do, but an error condition (dereferencing
of NULL pointer to be specific) is raised otherwise, whenever call to
bio_map_user in drivers/block/scsi_ioctl.c fails. The patch is
applicable at least to 2.5.69 and 2.5.70.
As for 69-ac. SG_IO doesn't work there at all (kernel logs "confused,
missing data" and then "N residual after xfer"). As far as I can tell
drivers/block/scsi_ioctl.c needs a "face lift," but that's AC's(?)
concern.
As for scsi_ioctl.c in more general sense. It apparently doesn't comply
with SG HOWTO, in particular it mis-interprets time-out values.
Background information and patch is available at
http://fy.chalmers.se/~appro/linux/DVD
+RW/scsi_ioctl-2.5.69.patch.
There're couple of other issues, usage of 'bytes' variable in access_ok
and DMA being off when bio_map_user fails, that needs some further
discussion in my opinion. As for discussion. Please note that I'm not
on the linux-kernel list so that keep me on Cc:.
Cheers. A.
