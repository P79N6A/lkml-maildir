I don't haven an UDF partition to test on so I am only reading the code. 
With your patch, every time an in-memory inode has the same uid/gid as the 
one you passed as mount option, the id on disk will become -1, no? So for 
example, doing chown 100 for a file writes -1 to disk if you passed 100 
as uid mount option. Am I missing something here?

Yes, I agree that the current code is broken. I was talking about what the 
semantics should be and that your patch doesn't quite get us there. Do you 
disagree with that? The UDF specification I am looking at [1] says that -1 
is used by operating systems that do not support uid/gid to denote an 
invalid id (although ECMA-167 doesn't seem to have such rule), which is  
why I think it's an bad idea for Linux to ever write it on disk. Instead, 
we should always write the proper id on disk unless it was invalid in the 
first place and we did not explicity change it (via chown, for example).
