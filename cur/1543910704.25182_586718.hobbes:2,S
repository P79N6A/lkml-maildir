what do you think about the rq_clock() #ifdef i did in the previous mail 
plus you making sched_clock() virtual? That way you can keep 
scheduler_tick() driven by real-time, although that generally will cause 
artifacts with SMP load-balancing too. (that was true in the past too)
but i dont mind your patch either - it's really the architecture's 
choice how visible it wants to make external load to the task stats of 
its virtual machines. I think it is more logical to say that 100% CPU 
time displayed in 'top' means that the task got all the CPU time it 
asked for from the virtual machine. (and if you are curious about how 
much time was stolen from the virtual box altogether you look at the 
stolen-time stats in isolation.)
