One possibility is to make the inode semaphore a rwsem, and to have NFS 
take that for read until the sendpage is complete.  The idea of splitting 
the inode semaphore up into two (one rw against truncate) has been bounced 
around for a few other reasons (like allowing multiple concurrent reads + 
writes to a file).  Perhaps its time to bite the bullet and do it.
