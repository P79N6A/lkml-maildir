Hi,
I encounter a giant load (up to 10.0) when I copy files, either from a
remote server to the local machine, or even locally. Because I see
kswapd causing the high load, I decided to forward my email to the
kernel list; maybe anyone has a clue.
The setup is:
OS: Redhat FC3 with 2.6.11-1.14_FC3smp (redhat distro) kernel, XFS filesystem
HW: Dual opteron 2.0GHz on Tyan motherboard, 4Gb RAM
The partition i am using is:
2.1Tb hardware RAID-5 unit served by 3ware controller (8 x 300Gb)
OR
300Gb simple SATA disk, also served by a 3ware controller.
I have no clue where to start combatting this problem.
- Kernel specific?
- Due to improper setup of the 3ware controllers?
- XFS filesystem specific?

Before I start extensive experimenting, maybe someone knows right away
what causes high loads due to "kswapd* and pdflush".
Cheers
Gaspar
