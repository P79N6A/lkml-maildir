OK, I'll bite..
Why is this?
I saw the post about having to have access to a lock directory by a
cvsuser, but how is that different than having that directory with an
ACL entry that includes the cvsuser? Or an ACL that includes the
group that the cvsuser is a member of?
Granted, each project repository would have such a directory for
locks belonging to the project, but that seems to already be the
case. Setting up the ACL would just be one additional step in
setting up a project.
