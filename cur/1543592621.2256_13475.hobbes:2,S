Done. 
Seems that taking 8139too.o from 2.4.3-ac3 fixes the problem. 
Tortured it much more as it was required to get 2.4.4-ac[356] and 2.4.5. to 
freeze (FTP uploads and downloads totally more than 100Mb with speed about
600Kb/s, for bad version of 8138too.c about 10Mb was usually more than enough
for freezing)
