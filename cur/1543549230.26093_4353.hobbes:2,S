inlines usually generate worse code than macros (the gcc manual lies on that),
e.g. the register allocation is usually worse and CSE doesn't work that well.
Normally it makes not that much difference, but these macros are rather
performance critical. 
Better would be to use statement blocks like
#define bla(x) ({ __u32 tmp__ = (x); ....; tmp__; }) 
I would prefer to fix the callers anyways, because it is clearer this way.
