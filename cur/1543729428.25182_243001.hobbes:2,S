Interestingly enough - it is network related... If I unplug the e100
cable before booting, and let things come up before plugging it in
I'm set to go (thus far) !
I'm wondering if it might be related to:
	OOPS: 2.6.8.1 QoS and routing conflict (bug)
and by delaying the ifup, I've missed some of the problem.
I'll let it run as long as possible - at least now I should be able
to capture the oops should it bite me again.

Mere nonexistence is a feeble excuse for declaring a thing unseeable. You
*can* see dragons.  You just have to look in the right direction.
