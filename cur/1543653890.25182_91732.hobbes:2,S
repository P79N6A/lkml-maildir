	Hello, Alan, it's me again.
	You were right. After running memtest86 on the box for some time, it began to 
spit a lot of errors along the whole 512 MB DIMM.
	I've replaced the DIMM with a smaller one and had asked for a replacement 
(thankfully it was under warranty yet). ftp.es.debian.org is up and happily 
running again.
	Thank you for your support, you people in l-k.
