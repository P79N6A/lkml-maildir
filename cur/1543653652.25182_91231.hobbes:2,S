Regarding megaraid, Stephen Hemming and Mark Haverkamp posted about
problems, leading to this:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-scsi&m=103728900228366&w=2
Generally - the megaraid had problems, where the aic driver did not using
the same disk drives. AFAICT the megaraid caused a problem, and its error
handling is non existent, so it is unable to recover from the problem. I'm
sure Mark or Stephen could provide details.

If you are talking about rmmod your-scsi-adapter, or removing a scsi_device
vi /proc/scsi, yes, there are problems in sysfs and in scsi. None of the
sysfs fixes are in the current bk tree, I assume Pat Mochel needs to push
them (he hasn't been online recently).
We can push a simple scsi fix (via James B), but the scsi sysfs code is not
good, Mike Anderson is working on some patches for that.
