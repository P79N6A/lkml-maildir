That's 140 cpu cycles on a 2 GHz CPU, probably less time than
what a single cache miss would cost for non-scheduler-intensive
workloads.
This would mean that for a workload which is doing real work,
and pushes the scheduler out of the L1 cache, the slowdown
would be a lot more simply due to the extra cache misses the
extra inlines generate.

Rik
