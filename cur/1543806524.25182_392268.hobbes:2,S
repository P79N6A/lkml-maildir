Indeed, seems that hwif->max_sg_nents is not respected when
setting queue ->max_hw_segments and ->max_phys_segments.
Does the logic really work the same?
Isn't PCI_DMA_BUS_IS_PHYS == 0 for SN2?
If so then the code sets ->max_{hw,phys}_segments
to IOC4_PRD_ENTRIES/2 which actually shouldn't hurt...

I have no big problem with applying patch as it is but I think that
it just hides the real problem and/or makes it harder to hit...
