Hi,
i've just written here about a problem with my pcmcia..
At pcmcia-cs-devel@sourceforge.net they say me that the problem ("IRQ
Routing conflict") is the bios and they don't know how to fix it.
I'd like to know that someone have written a workaround... :-)
My bios is Phoenix KA.M1.37 (in a notebook hp pavillon ze4288), but a
lot of hp and compaq notebook use it.
tnx
