The panic is caused by timeout on a scsi command when the error handler
has unexpectedly gone away, possibly because of this bug, where the erorr
handler exits early because of a SIGHUP:

Fixing the panic won't fix the corruption. scsi should really offline the
adapter and scsi devices on the adapter rather than panic.
