Hi,
Richard B. Johnson did this patch for 2.4.22. And, I applied it and
tested it on both 2.4.22 and 2.6.0-test6. It seems to work.
Please apply this patch to both 2.4.22 and 2.6.0-test6.

`Right,' said Ford, `I'm going to have a look.'
He glanced round at the others. `Is no one going to say,

They all shook their heads. `Oh well.'
