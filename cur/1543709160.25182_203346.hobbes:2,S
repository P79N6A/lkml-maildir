| 
| Could I ask anyone with a USB Zip drive and a ps2 mouse to try
| to confirm this bizarre bug for me?
| 
| To reproduce it should be simple:
| 
| 1)  Compile USB support as modular, *not* compiled in.
| 
| 2)  The USB Zip drive *must* be plugged in during boot.
|      This bug won't show if you plug in the drive later.
| 
| 3)  Reboot and see if your ps2 mouse works.
Hi,
I'm not seeing a problem with this.  I'm using 2.6.4-rc1.
However, you didn't mention what modules were being loaded
automatically, so we could have a difference in that area.
If you care to specify a module list, I can test it again.
And is your USB Zip drive on a UHCI or OHCI controller?
I have both, so I can test it either way.
