Please remember, no one is calling 2.6 "stable" anymore than they are
calling it "development".  The current development model is different
than what we used to do pre 2.6.  See the archives for details about
this if you want more information.

Again, because an in-kernel devfs is not the correct thing to do.  devfs
has been disabled for a few months now, and I don't think anyone has
missed it yet :)
