Yes, so again. Everyone agrees, I think, that mount should follow
symlinks. Moreover, one expects a certain parallelism between the
behaviour of mount and umount. So umount should follow symlinks
until it comes to the mount point. Your problem is that the mount
point used to be an ordinary directory but now is overmounted by
a filesystem that has a symlink at the root.
Now the old tradition is to say `umount(specialdev)', so perhaps
you can do the umount without kernel patch by mentioning the
device instead of the mount point? It is a Linux extension to
allow `umount(mountdir)'.
Not much is wrong with your 1-symbol patch, and at first sight I
cannot find any standards that both mention mount and know about
symlinks. Still, the patch is probably a small step away from
tradition, so it should probably be avoided if possible.
