... and it may *cause* future errors by making it harder to find bugs, too.
In other words, your patch doesn't actually fix anything, it *masks*
potential bugs which would also be triggered by interrupts in kernel
mode.  This is bad.
You realize you just make a distinction between synchronous and
asynchronous events, such that your patch means that only asynchronous
events would catch the bugs you mask.  This makes bug hunting much harder.
If anything it would be better to poison those fields so that we can
smoke out anything that trusts them.
