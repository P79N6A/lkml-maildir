Hi,
Thanks for explaining the purpose behind the proposed change,
but I'm still not convinced that allowing NULL argument in _put()
is a good idea, however:

The whole _purpose_ of get()/put() functions (i.e. refcounting in general)
is to ensure that the (shared) objects don't go away from under us while
we're holding them. The proposed change _weakens_ the API itself by
allowing a buggy driver (that somehow called into _put() codepath without
a _get() before it) to not get flagged immediately (through an oops). This
inevitably leads to some difficult-to-debug problems -- I have suffered
debugging issues created by such weak/loose APIs myself.

But we pay a heavy price for the "programmer convenience" (just
avoiding some conditionals / multiple goto labels in error cleanup
paths) that we get in return. I do believe the kernel would've been
much less buggy, if only kfree(NULL) wasn't legal.
But even if you do want to allow NULL arguments to such functions,
for certain situations, you could always write a little wrapper over
the lower function that'll include the "if (not NULL)" kind of check.

I'd be gladder if you could point me to code where this change really helps.
I'd definitely like to send patches, why not.

As I said, changing generic refcounting API functions (which is what
xxx_put() is) to simplify open-coding of a conditional in the caller's
error cleanup paths does not sound advantageous to me at all. On the
contrary, it weakens the refcounting API, and I can only imagine the
kernel getting buggier with such changes.
