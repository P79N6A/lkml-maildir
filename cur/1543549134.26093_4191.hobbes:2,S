The floppy I/O error occurred 13 seconds after the partition table was
printed (I'd removed the timestamps to make the messages easier to read),
and the machine wasn't doing anything else -- that is why I believe the
floppy access was triggered by attempting to mount the zip.
However, I have just tried to reproduce it, and I just get the hang in
wait_on_buffer, and not the floppy access.
