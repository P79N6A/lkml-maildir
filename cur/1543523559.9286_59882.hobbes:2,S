 Manfred:
          I have compiled test kernels from 386 on up and they are all
the same. Since the install kernel works and I expected that it was
compiled for a 386 I gave it a try. But all with the same result, a
hang before the "Uncompressing" message. I just can't figure out what
might be different about the install kernel that allows it to work.

Check you compiler settings:
Cyrix 6x86 supports the CMOV instruction
AMD K6/2 doesn't support them.
I guess you've compiled a kernel for PPro instead of Pentium/TSC?
