what are you smoking? I read your patch and there's nothing related to
such fix in your patch. I won't have much more time to follow up on this
thread. From now on about the highmem deadlocks topic I will only listen
to real world bugreports of 2.4.5 plus the bugfix I posted a few minuts
ago. If anybody is able to reproduce the deadlocks press SYSRQ+T and
send me the output along the System.map. Thanks in advance for your
cooperation.
