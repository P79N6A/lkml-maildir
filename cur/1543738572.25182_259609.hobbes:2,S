Hi,
my forcedeth driver said:
eth1: received irq with unknown events 0x1. Please report
It happened, when I tried to connect two machines with straight ethernet
cable. 
One of the machines is a Dell Poweredge 400SC, with an intel E1000 card, 
the other is a home-made one, with nvidia nforce2 chipset based motherboard,
integrated nvidia ethernet, and a 3com 905C network card. 
When I connect the Dell machine to the nvidia ethernet card, I get the
"unknown events" warning, and the E1000's driver reports that the link is
down. However when I connect the E1000 and the 3com card, everything works
fine. Both kernels are vanilla 2.4.27.
lspci of the nvidia ethernet card:
