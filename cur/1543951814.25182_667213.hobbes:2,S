I'm not entirely sure if it is a problem. In some cases it
certainly is an inconvenience, though ;). I mentioned the
difference between the old and generic versions, because
of the possibility of dependence of this behaviour.
Indeed I see for example (in fs/ext4/mballoc.c).
    bit = mb_find_next_zero_bit(bitmap_bh->b_data, end, bit);
    if (bit >= end)
        break;
    next = mb_find_next_bit(bitmap_bh->b_data, end, bit);
    if (next > end)
        next = end;
    free += next - bit;
So here it needed to adjust the value.

This is a different 'problem'. find_next_bit works on arrays of long,
while the bitmaps in ext4_find_next_bit are of type void * and seem
not to have any alignment restrictions. ext4 implements wrappers
around find_next_bit to solve that 'problem'.
The question that arises is: do we want find_first_bit, find_next_bit.
etc. to always return a value in the range [0, size], or do we want
to allow implementations that return [0, size-1] if there is a bit
found and something else (roundup(size,bitsperlong) or ulongmax, for
example if, none were found?
The current x86_64 versions of find_first_bit and find_next_bit return
roundup(size,bitsperlong) if no bits were found, but on the other hand
I guess most bitmaps are a multiple of bitsperlong bits in size, which
hides the difference.
