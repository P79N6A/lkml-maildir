FWIW, ubuntu's man-pages claim:
"       --no-same-permissions
              apply umask to extracted files (the default for non-root users)"
and
"       -p, --same-permissions, --preserve-permissions
              ignore umask when extracting files (the default for root)"
Maybe you are untarring as non-root and David is untarring as root?

That I do not know.
