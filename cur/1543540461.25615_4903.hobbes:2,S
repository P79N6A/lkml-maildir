Ha Ha Ha. Thank you for the good laugh. Before you make a comment like
that I suggest you take a long look at the XFree86 code. You will think
twice before you make a remark like that. See the thing is XGGI already
supports the /dev/event interface. Something XF4 will get around to
someday. So he doesn't really have a choice here.
Personally. Their are really no good up to date X servers out their.
XFree86 is a piece of &$#*. XGGI lacks any kind of graphics support. The
commerical X servers are the best X servers out their but they have a
hard time keeping up with changes in the linux community. Sometimes I
really like to see another open source X server group form. Starting from
scratch they would do a 100 times better job than XFree86. 
Q: Why did they deprecate a.out support in linux?
A: Because a nasty coff is bad for your elf.
