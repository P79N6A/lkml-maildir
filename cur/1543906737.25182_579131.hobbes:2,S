PA-RISC has the same problem with USB. We can't reprogram the IOMMU
windows at boot time unless the USB controller is forcefully stopped
from doing DMA. "BIOS" leaves the USB DMA enabled to avoid loosing
activity between polls for input.
PA-RISC solves this by calling back into the "BIOS" (aka PDC) to cleanly stop
all possible DMA devices. Other arches probably don't have this luxury.
