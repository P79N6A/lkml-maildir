Well, on my box the USB suspend also doesn't work with USB_SUSPEND set,
but the reason is different:
sb usb2: 'global' suspend -16
hub 2-0:1.0: suspend error -16
suspend_device(): usb_suspend+0x0/0x5b [usbcore]() returns -16
Could not suspend device usb2: error -16
The .config and full dmesg output (with the three debug patches applied) are
attached.
Greetings,
