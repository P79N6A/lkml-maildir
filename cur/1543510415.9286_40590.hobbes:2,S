My lockup problems for 2.2.12pre6 are on Celeron 433 systems while my PII 266
laptop has been running without flaw despite kernel compiles, heavy
X/Netscape/Java/StarOffice and VMWare use.
I thought it might be a problem with SCSI since of course my laptop is IDE.
I did have SMP/MTRR on, pentium pro configured.  Falling back to no SMP, no
MTRR, Pentium, 2.2.12pre11.
That's a few hits on Celeron, but also K6.
