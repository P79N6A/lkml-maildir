I am ignorant on the subject, but why LDT is used in Linux at all?
LDT register can be set to 0, this can speed up task switch time and save 
some memory used for LDT.
I see a i386 specific syscall (kernel/ldt.c:sys_modify_ldt()) and 
        /*
         * default LDT is a single-entry callgate to lcall7 for iBCS
         * and a callgate to lcall27 for Solaris/x86 binaries
         */
        set_call_gate(&default_ldt[0],lcall7);
        set_call_gate(&default_ldt[4],lcall27);
in kernel/traps.c:trap_init().
Is it used elsewhere?
