Well, if you've got a blocking socket, and do a nonblocking read with 
MSG_DONTWAIT, everything works fine.  You lose a bit of performance, but it works.
The problem case is if you create a socket, set O_NONBLOCK, do select, clear 
O_NONBLOCK, then do a recvmsg().
I suspect it's not a very common thing to do, so my proposal would still help 
the vast majority of existing apps.
