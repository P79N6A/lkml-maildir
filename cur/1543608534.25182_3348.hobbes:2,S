Just a quickie....
Any reason we can't move all the process info into something like 
/proc/pid/* instead of in the root /proc tree?
Should be pretty easy to do, could still have the pid's in the root /proc 
tree, and if they get read, do what /proc/pci does, and log a warning about 
"xxx is using old /proc interfaces". Makes it just that little bit easier 
to parse processes without fiddling around if you know all the dir's are 
always processes. It's also a bit of a visual cleanup when you have lots of 
processes and do a 'ls /proc'.
There is probably a few other things in /proc/* that could be moved out and 
put in more sensible places (eg: interrupts, irq, devices, mtrr, slabinfo, 
mounts, modules, stat, etc), that really define what they belong to (a 
/proc/kernel/* mebbe). Having /proc basically full of directories would 
clean things up a bit. Some things don't need to change though (eg: uptime, 
version).
