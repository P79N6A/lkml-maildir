Using USB instead of the serial line or the network card would be
the best IMHO, because:
	* many machines have network cards, but all machines have USB
	  (and it's gonna stay this way for some time)
	  
	* the USB stack seems simpler than the net stack + 
	  (eventualy) pcmcia + network card driver.
Maybe the 'simpler' USB protocols (usbkbd and usbmouse) could be
used for this, I don't know...
