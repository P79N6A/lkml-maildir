The other thing I forgot to mention ... we used to have a concept of 
"performance regression testing" (to make sure that we had not gotten a 
lot slower on the latest rc) - not just runs on every release candidate 
of a few complex benchmark tests (like SpecWeb or Netbench or some 
enterprise Java perf test) but the idea was to run on every rc an fs 
microbenchmark (more like iozone) to ensure that we did not have some 
small functional problem in an fs or mm subsystem was causing big, 
noticeable degradation in performance (large read or small read or large 
write or small write, random or sequential etc.). I have not seen anyone 
doing that on Linux in an automated fashion (e.g running iozone 
automated every time a new 2.6.x.rc on a half a dozen of the fs - simply 
to verify that things had not gotten drastically worse on a particular 
fs due to a bug or sideffect of a global VFS change).
