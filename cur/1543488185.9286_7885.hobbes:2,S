With all the discussion about the tradeoff between physical memory
size and maximum virtual memory size awhile back, I was surprised to
find that the RLIMIT_AS (address space) limit is about 2GB,
and it doesn't seem possible for a process to get more VM than that.
The essence of the problem is that the rlimit_cur and rlimit_max
members of struct rlimit are simply type "long" and for size-oriented
limits (like RLIMIT_AS) they count bytes.  So, the most you can have
is 0x7fffffff.  So my questions:
1) Am I missing something?
2) Is there a solution for machines where sizeof(long)==4?
   One approach would be to make RLIMIT_AS work in units of KB.
   The only objection I can think of, is that it would then differ
   from the other size-oriented limits, and that would be a bad thing.
3) If the AS limit is going to stay this way, why bother with the standard
   #define __PAGE_OFFSET (0xC0000000) in <asm-i386/page.h>?  I don't see
   any reason not to just let it be 0x80000000 all the time.
Please CC me in reply, as I follow the list only through archives.
