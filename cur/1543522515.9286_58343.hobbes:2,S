That's nice. My problem: since 2.2.15pre1 I am having problems with my
Intel EtherExpress 10/100 NIC (i82557 chip on it). While I am uploading
(transmitting) heavily, it sometimes stops and dumps some debug data to
syslog. Then it waits for few seconds and everything continues. And then
it stops again. The delays slow down upload a lot. The resulting files
which I upload are fine (md5sum checked). I had absolutely no problems
with 2.2.14 and older kernel.
