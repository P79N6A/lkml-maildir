Modulo the observation that this change will break any Linux-specific
application that violate POSIX.1's requirement that infop not be NULL
(*), and rely on the existing Linux behavior for
waitd(idtype,id,NULL,options):
Acked-by: Michael Kerrisk <mtk.manpages@gmail.com>
(*) It seems unlikely that such applications exist, and we really
should make this change for POSIX.1 conformance.
