For prep_zero_page() and clear_highpage() we can't blame gcc since we 
force gcc to always inline them.
buffered_rmqueue() and prep_new_page() are static functions with only 
one caller each, and for the normal non-debug case it's a really nice 
optimization to have them inlined automatically. But it might make sense 
to add -fno-inline-functions-called-once to the CFLAGS depending on some 
debug option?
