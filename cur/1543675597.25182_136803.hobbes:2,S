Did you read the patch?
When getting scheduled, the workspace remains associated with the
owning process ( z->workspace, z->ws_num ).  Other processes trying to
grab a workspace will get put on a waitqueue ( zlib_workspace_sem ).
The workspace is not exactly per cpu, it is per process.  Just the
amount of workspaces happens to be equal to the amount of cpus in the
system, but a couple more or less should work just as well.  
In softirq context you would be right.  Preempt is disabled anyway and
cpu affinity comes for free.
