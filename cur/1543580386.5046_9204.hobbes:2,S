Thanks for your reply.
On the same topic; I am also wondering if there is a reason
why your RAID1/RAID5 hot-add/hot-remove patch (originally against
2.4.0-ac9, Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.30.0101151248200.1398-200000@e2>)
does not go into Linus tree.  
I saw Neil Brown commenting on the patch in linux-raid list in
<http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-raid&m=98028199906903&w=2>
(he was suggesting to revert it for somebody who had raid related
crashes), but do not know what happened after that discussion.
Alan Cox still seems to have the hot-add/hot-remove patch in his
tree as of 2.4.0-ac12.
