There are a whole slew of later changesets that haven't made it in yet.
The root cause of your particular problem is not the lun copy optimization,
but a problem with the layout of a data structure that is dma'ed to the
controller and a controller errata.  The fix for this is available in 
the 20030603 bksend file at my site:
http://people.FreeBSD.org/~gibbs/linux/SRC/
I will try to find some time later this week to review the code that
is now in 2.6 and generate updated changesets for that branch.
