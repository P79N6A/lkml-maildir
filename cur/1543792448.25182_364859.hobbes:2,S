I'd much rather use entry 8 instead, which should just automatically mean 
that selector 0x40 _always_ points to virtual address 0x400. No switching 
etc..
Isn't this what Wine already has to work around, or something?
Ingo, can we move the TLS selectors upwards, or does user space perhaps 
know about the current TLS layout? Wine in particular may well know ;(
