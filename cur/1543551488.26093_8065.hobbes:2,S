Oh, also, can you try to see what happens if you change the define for
	#define pcibios_assign_all_busses()	0
to a 1 in include/asm-i386/pci.h? That should force Linux to re-configure
all buses, regardless of whether they have been set up some way by the
BIOS. Which might make a difference.
But please do this separately from the extra debug code - I'd like to see
what the debug code says regardless of this change..
