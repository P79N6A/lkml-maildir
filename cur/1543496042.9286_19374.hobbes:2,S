	We should move the test a bit down, after the request_module() attempts.
Yes, I also thought of that and promised Andre a new version.
Let me make it right away.

Your line numbers may differ, I have other changes here as well.
This is the same four lines as before, but moving the code down
forces me to handle drive->usage and MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT.
By the way, if I am not mistaken this now fixes a bug in the old code:
it looks like drive->usage was never decremented again in case
the driver open failed.
