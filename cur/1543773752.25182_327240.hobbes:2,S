well my system is using PCIe instead so it's a little different. It 
seems that the PCIe fixups are enough to get the BAR regions assigned 
correctly. prior to loading the nvidia driver the BARs are listed as 
disabled in lspci -vvx, but after loading the BARs are not disabled and 
I am able run X on both GPUs fine. I haven't tried running any OpenGL 
type tests yet on the system.
pci=routeirq is a red herring, this is about the interrupts and 
shouldn't affect the bar allocation.
it might be useful for you to post a dmesg with PCI_DEBUG enabled and 
specify which kernel version you are using. My system only worked with 
the most recent 2.6.12 (but i think that's due to some of the pci 
express changes and some of the bridge handling since our system is a 
little unique...)
