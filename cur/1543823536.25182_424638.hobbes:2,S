There's also a surprising number of people still running
their shiny new x86-64's in 32 bit mode.  (I suspect because
they're reliant upon applications that aren't 64-bit clean
that for whatever reason don't run in 32-bit emulation).
I'd be surprised if any of the major distros stopped shipping
a 32-bit x86 release for several years.
