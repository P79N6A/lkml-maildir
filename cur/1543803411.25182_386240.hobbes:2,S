Some quick comments:
+       if (len) {
+               epx_c3_pet();
+       }
Doesn't need brackets (minor style)
Otherwise it looks excellent but should use request_region and friends
to claim the two ports it uses.
The see the "Sign your work:" bit of Documentation/SubmittingPatches are
it looks ready to go in.
