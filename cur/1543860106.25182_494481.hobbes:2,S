Subject: [patch] respect srctree/objtree in Documentation/DocBook/Makefile
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/27/111

the KERNELDOC and DOCPROC variables are relative to the
$(srctree)/$(objtree) and expect to be run only from there ...
attached patch adds proper srctree/objtree prefixes to both variables
