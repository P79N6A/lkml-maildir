Thanks, Thomas.
I believe we definitely want to nail this down before 2.6.22-final,
but there's a good workaround in the interim (CONFIG_DETECT_SOFTLOCKUP=y)
and we've got at least a couple of months 'till then.
I think I may have fiddled with the RTC config, so I'll compare with my
old config and see what changed.
Cheers
