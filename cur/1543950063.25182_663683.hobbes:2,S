Hi Peter,
Thanks for your comments.

These simple APIs are nothing but raw mkdir/open/read/write/close
operations.

I disagree. Allowing multiple resource managers allows more flexibility.
One thing the configuration subsystem aims to do is to allow permissions
to the groups. With this happening, a resource manager does not need to
about the existence of other groups, it can control only the resources
allotted to it. And since the top level is controlled by the
administrator, he is aware of the groups and their needs. (I've given an
example of such a scenario in the document as well).
Hope this helps answer your question.
Thanks,
