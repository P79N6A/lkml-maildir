If I understand you,  you then just have to mem= with the correct
value reported via, for example:
ducrot@novae:~$ dmesg | grep 'ACPI data'
 BIOS-e820: 000000000fef0000 - 000000000feff000 (ACPI data)
Interresting :)
Ok.  Here is actually a method:
A phoenix bios (and you have one) will reserved typically 64ko
for ACPI data below ACPI NVS.
ducrot@novae:~$ dmesg | grep -i 'ACPI NVS'
 BIOS-e820: 000000000feff000 - 000000000ff00000 (ACPI NVS)
ducrot@novae:~$ python
Python 2.1.1+ (#1, Jan  8 2002, 00:37:12) 
[GCC 2.95.4 20011006 (Debian prerelease)] on linux2
Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 0x000000000feff000 - 65536
267317248
If my bios will be incorrect, I will then pass
mem=267317248#65536
and voila.
But big problem though.  It is really really strange that the
BIOS mainteners have broken e820 call, are you sure you have
enabled acpi in BIOS, and/or power management ?
