WITHOUT Disconnect my System is stable, but hotter when idle, so that is 
not the point. Ross wanted the patched to work with APIC and Disconnect.
DO you guys use APIC (not ACPI)? I use both APIC (and local APIC) and 
ACPI. ACPI is not the problem (unless they break something...) but APIC 
and CPU Disconnect makes trouble on nforce2.
