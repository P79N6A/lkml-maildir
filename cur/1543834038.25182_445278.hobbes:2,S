Hint: If you're running a program to dump memory, it's going to be calling
I/O drivers and so on - and all this activity has to modify at least *some*
memory (unless you're on an architecture with a *really* deep register stack ;)
You can't ensure that *no* updates take place.  At best, you can minimize
the number of pages touched.
For an example of the kind of hoops you need to jump through, I suggest a
careful reading of the 'suspend' and/or 'suspend2' source code - a large part
of that code is basically taking a snapshot of memory.
Also, you'll need to make sure that whatever software is running that
you're trying to snapshot is fairly tolerant of pauses - if you have a
disk that manages 20MBytes/second and you have 256M of memory, you're going
to be sitting there for 10 seconds. This can come as a surprise to programs
that were sleeping on a timer interrupt.. :)
