Subject: duration of udelay differs with activated realtime-preempt patch?

kernel: 2.6.14 with and without the realtime-preempt patch
hi list,
after measuring the duration of the function udelay (with oscilloscope
at parallel port), I figured out that udelay (5usec) with activated
realtime- preempt patch lasts a little bit longer. Without the patch the
time is exact.
All kernel debug switches are turned off at compile time.
Can anyone suggest why this happens?
