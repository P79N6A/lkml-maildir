From: Rusty Russell <>
Subject: [RFC PATCH 2/3] lguest: Boot with virtual == physical to get closer to native Linux.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/4/203

(This won't be very interesting to the paravirt discussion, it only
changes lguest).
1) This allows us to get alot closer to booting bzImages.
2) It means we don't have to know page_offset.
3) The Guest needs to modify the boot pagetables to create the
   PAGE_OFFSET mapping before jumping to C code.
4) guest_pa() walks the page tables rather than using page_offset.
5) We don't use page_offset to figure out whether to emulate: it was
   always kinda questionable, and won't work for instructions done
   before remapping (bzImage unpacking in particular).
6) We still want the kernel address for tlb flushing: have the initial
   hypercall give us that, too.

- * We know that CONFIG_PAGE_OFFSET sets what virtual address the kernel expects
- * to be.  We don't know what that option was, but we can figure it out
- * approximately by looking at the addresses in the code.  I chose the common
- * case of reading a memory location into the %eax register:
- *
- *  movl <some-address>, %eax
- *
- * This gets encoded as five bytes: "0xA1 <4-byte-address>".  For example,
- * "0xA1 0x18 0x60 0x47 0xC0" reads the address 0xC0476018 into %eax.
- *
- * In this example can guess that the kernel was compiled with
- * CONFIG_PAGE_OFFSET set to 0xC0000000 (it's always a round number).  If the
- * kernel were larger than 16MB, we might see 0xC1 addresses show up, but our
- * kernel isn't that bloated yet.
- *
- * Unfortunately, x86 has variable-length instructions, so finding this
- * particular instruction properly involves writing a disassembler.  Instead,
- * we rely on statistics.  We look for "0xA1" and tally the different bytes
- * which occur 4 bytes later (the "0xC0" in our example above).  When one of
- * those bytes appears three times, we can be reasonably confident that it
- * forms the start of CONFIG_PAGE_OFFSET.
