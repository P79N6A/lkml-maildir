Vivek for this first round can we please take out the ELF
note processing.  Now that vmlinux has ELF notes of interest
to the bootloader we really should be getting the ELF notes
from there.
So the generation of the ELF notes needs to move into the
vmlinux and then we need to copy them to ELF header.
If we just remove the ELF note munging code from this patch
that should be a good first step in getting the ELF notes correct.
