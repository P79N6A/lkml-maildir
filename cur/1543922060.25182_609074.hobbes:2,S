Hello,
When I run 'halt' or 'poweroff' (sysvinit-2.86) the kernel prints:
Halting.
Shutdown: hdc
ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:01:05.0 disabled
ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:01:04.0 disabled
ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:01:03.0 disabled
ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:01:02.0 disabled
Power down.
acpi_power_off called
But the system does not shut down. (The fans keep spinning, the LEDs
keep shining, the integrated LCD keeps displaying.) Basically, the 
motherboard is still providing power to every component, as if the power 
supply had refused to stop.
I followed the instructions given here:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6431
cf. 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9148
The system is an FWA-3140-CE:
http://advantech.com/products/1U-Rackmount-Intel-Pentium-4Processor-based-Platform-with-4PCI-LAN-Ports-2-PCI-Expansion-Slots/mod_1-23A2W4.aspx
The manufacturer is unwilling to help because they don't support Linux, 
and claim it is a software issue. I will ask them whether Windows is 
able to properly shut the system down.
What can I do to help fix the problem?
Regards.
