Hmm, I don't see why latency is important for rcu - we only want to
free datastructures.. (mm load?).
On the other hands they are the experts on RCU, not I so I'll believe them.

My problem with this appropech is just that we use kernel threads for
more and more stuff - always creating new ones.  I think at some point
they will sum up badly.
