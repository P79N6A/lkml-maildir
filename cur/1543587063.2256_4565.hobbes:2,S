See the SANE project, which has support for lots of SCSI scanners, and is
the defacto standard for image acquisition for GIMP and such.  It has lots
of other good features already (dynamic loading of backends (i.e. "device
drivers"), network device access, GUI/text front ends, etc).  I believe it
is also being used for other high-end image acquisition devices, not just
scanners.
