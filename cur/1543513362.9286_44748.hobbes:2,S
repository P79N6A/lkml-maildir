Hello,
The mount(2) system call will refuse to mount a device if it is already
mounted elsewhere. And rightly so. But mounting via loopback (-o loop)
allows to mount the same file on different mount points which causes some
unexpected results. I understand that this is because a
different /dev/loopX is allocated for each instance, but shouldn't the
mount fail even on a different /dev/loopX if it refers to a file already
attached to some other /dev/loopY to simulate the normal mount(2)
semantics?
regards,
