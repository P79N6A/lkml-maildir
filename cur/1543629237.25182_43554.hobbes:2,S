Patching the kernel how, and where?
Calculating the lookup table automatically at startup is definitely planned,
and yes, essential to avoid an unmanageble proliferation of configuration
files.  It's also possible to pass the configuration as a list of
mem=size@physaddr kernel command line entries, which is a pragmatic solution
for configurations with unusual memory mappings, but not too many of them.

We *are* making clever use of the mmu in config_nonlinear, it is doing the
nonlinear kernel virtual mapping for us.  Did you have something more clever
in mind?
