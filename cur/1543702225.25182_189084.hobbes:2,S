For that one needs to know how the namespaces are used, not just how 
they are implemented.  There was a long discussion on this on #kernel 
yesterday, by the way.

Do they?  In order for that to be a "clearly", I believe one needs to 
understand how namespaces are used in practice.  It may not be desirable 
or even possible; this starts getting into a policy decision.

dangerous to me.
