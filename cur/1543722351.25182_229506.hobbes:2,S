Martin et al,
So I configed with your patch just the basics and get
similar times that I do with 2.6.7 virigin and 2.4.21.
 However, as soon as I enable 4G split, the rt
increases by ~35s (out of 1m45s compared to 1m10s). 
Do you know if this is in line w/expectations?  Is
there anyway to reduce this?
Thank you for your time.
