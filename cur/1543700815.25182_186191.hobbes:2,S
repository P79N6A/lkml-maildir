There might be no need for such a workaround - a lot of PS/2 devices
which were not intended for PCs work fine in set 3, particularly if
the device they were intended to work with uses set 3 natively, where
this conflict with protocol scancodes problem doesn't exist.  If the
keyboard works in set 3, add 0xab85 to the list of keyboards to force
set 3 for, (and maybe also add the ID for my keyboard while we're at
it :-) ).
John.
