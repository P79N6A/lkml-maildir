during make modules it fails with
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-6mdk/drivers'
make -C atm modules
make[2]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-6mdk/drivers/atm'

`/home/quintela/rpm/2418/BUILD/linux/include/linux/module.h', needed by
`eni.o'.  Stop.

well as you can see there is a problem here.. The fact that quintela is
not a user on my system and i believe juan quintela to be a kernel
developer. I could be wrong here. anyway i decided to perform a grep -r
quintela /usr/src/linux/* > output.txt it generated a 3MB  txt file i'm 
not attaching as of yet do to its size. if you would like it let me
know. Otherwise please have this hard linked directory removed  from the
source so i don't need to compile  from that dirctory :P 
Thanks
