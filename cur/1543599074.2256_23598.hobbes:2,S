this is fine, other servers do that as well and work.

this would be a bug in the initscripts, inetd is a rpc client so your
initscripts better make sure it is running (when neecsssary) before inetd.

portmap often is too slow on startup. move it earlier in the ss sequence
or add a sleep 2 somewhere.

just like othe rudp daemons they can linger, which works fine. also,
mountd does not need to be run all the time, it is very rarely used.
having said that, this is not kernel-related and shhould be taken
elsewhere. i managed to make (userspace) mountd run from inetd, but never
managed to get the nfsd working that way.
