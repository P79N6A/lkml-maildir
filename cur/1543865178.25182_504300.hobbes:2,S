I'm the LIRC maintainer. I don't know what let's you think LIRC wants to  
stay out-of-the-tree.
I just made clear that I don't have the time to do the merging of LIRC  
drivers to the kernel myself. In fact a lot of work still needs to be  
done before LIRC drivers are ready to be included into the kernel.  
Spreading the impression that LIRC refuses to work with kernel  
developers is not particularly helpful...
Any help welcome.
Christoph
