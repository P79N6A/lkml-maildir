Actually, I think the real issue here might be that the tg3 driver is
now behaving _differently_ to how other modern drivers work. It tries to
obtain the firmware once at initialisation time and if that fails it
doesn't register the device.
Other drivers will load the firmware later, at the time the device is
brought up. This means that even if you build the driver into the kernel
without its firmware, it can still request the firmware later, when you
try to start _using_ it. And when the file system is available.
I'll take a look and see if I can remedy that. Then we wouldn't _need_
the FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL option.
