Yep.  You're not the first to notice this.
Zach Brown has been finding and working around races just
like this while writing phhttpd.  In email to Zach and me, 
sct@redhat.com proposed:

Here's another possible race:
User closes fd 5.  Events for fd 5 are still in the signal queue.
User does accept(), which returns a new fd 5.
Your proposed new ioctl could eliminate both the race you're worried about
*and* the one I just pointed out if it also delivered a signal that said
"fd 5 created".  The user would then discard any events for fd 5
received after the close() but before the "fd 5 created" signal.
That "fd 5 created" signal would tell the user code to reset its
"fd 5 poll status" variable, which would then be updated by the sigio
signals whenever fd 5's poll status changed.  No need for an initial
call to poll() or a poll struct * in F_SETFAST then.
