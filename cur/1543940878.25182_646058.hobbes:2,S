Hi Guys,
Sorry for this newbie question,
but i would like to know how to find
out which modules are embedded
and running in a static kernel
because we have a kernel which
we don't know what components(drivers, ...)
are embedded and also, we don't know
which of those components are running
please, note it is not a 'moduled' kernel
is a static kernel and this means that
neither lsmod nor /proc/modules
provide the info that we are looking for
Kind Regards and Best Wishes,
Geraldo
