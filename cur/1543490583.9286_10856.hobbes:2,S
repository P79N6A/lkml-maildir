There is no *NEED* to specify the interpreter before each script. The fact
is, script interpreter locations are getting to be fairly standard
anymore, and it is only a few oddball scripts that would need this anyway.
But this is most definitely NOT a kernel issue. Perhaps you could use
binfmt_misc, or perhaps you could convince the vendor of your program to
follow the progression of Linux Standard Base (
http://www.linuxbase.org/
)
to see what decisions may be made by that committee.
The point is, there are a lot of poorly written/broken/misassumption
making programs/scripts/utilities out there, and it is up to the developer
of said program/script/utility to fix it, NOT hack the kernel to make
things that are broken work.
