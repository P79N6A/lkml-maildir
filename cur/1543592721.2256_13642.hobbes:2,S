Hallo,
Are there any deeper reasons, 
why
a) inode->i_blksize is set to PAGESIZE eg. 4096 independent of the actual
block size of the file system?
(I suppose, this is for performance reasons (paging), right?)
b) the number of blocks is counted in 512 Bytes and not in the actual blocksize
of the filesystem?
(is this for historical reasons??)
Thx,
Constantin
