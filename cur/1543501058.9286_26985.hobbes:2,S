Where are you sent patch ? It's just dumb to send patch staight to Linus if
it's not just fix for well-known problem or patch itself is not well-known
and discussed enough in one of few linux kernel related mailing lists...

Patch will not be included in standard kernel till it's not obvious that
functionality provided in patch or problem solved with patch is general
enough.
P.S. Oh, and BTW now there are DEEP rework of some systems in kernel so most
patches are rejected by Linus without any reasons whatsoever. Try to send it
later...
P.P.S. And since interceptors will alffect COMMON path for general subsystems
I expect STRONG feeling against such patch from Linus. Try to discuss problems
and how you interceptors can solve them here rather then try to push patch of
itself. Even if you patch will be rejected for some reason ideas from it can
be borrowed and reimplemented by someone...
