 I had tried it, but it turns out my trial used the old installed
libcdda_* libraries.  Now that I've got it using the new versions of
these, it looks as if 10pre0, with the debian patches, works ok for a
normal user (on x86_64 it needs the patch to be able to configure).
 Thanks for the pointer.  FWIW I can no longer replicate the failure
to mount a CD it had burned, will be doing more tests later.
