Great to see this here.

Is this AHCI specific or could be used by some other SATA hosts?

Worth to mention that this update also contains two new drivers from Alan,
pata_acpi and pata_ns87415. :)

Unfortunately both are broken ATM, details below.

This potentially adds a regression for nVidia boxes (but ACPI cable
detection should compensate for it):
pata_amd's ->cable_detect checks UDMA timings to get the cable type
(cable detection is done before the SRST) but pata_amd's ->set_piomode
messes with UDMA timings.  It seems that both methods need fixing.

Would be nice to have Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt updated as well.

Won't build because this libata update removes ->irq_ack and ->port_disable
methods from struct ata_port.

Won't build, same problem as with AVR32 PATA driver + needs update to
accomodate for libata-link patches.
There are some other problems:
a.
+config PATA_BF54X_DMA
+       bool "DMA mode"
+       depends on PATA_BF54X
+       default y
+       help
+         Enable DMA mode for Blackfin ATAPI controller.
The preferred solution would be to use module parameter.
If this option is on by default it may be even possible to remove it
completly since this libata update also contains patch from Alan allowing
DMA disable per different classes of ATA devices.
b.
+static struct ata_port_info bfin_port_info[] = {
+       {
+               .sht            = &bfin_sht,
+               .flags          = ATA_FLAG_SLAVE_POSS
+                               | ATA_FLAG_MMIO
+                               | ATA_FLAG_NO_LEGACY,
+               .pio_mask       = 0x1f, /* pio0-4 */
+               .mwdma_mask     = 0,
+#ifdef CONFIG_PATA_BF54X_DMA
+               .udma_mask      = ATA_UDMA5,
+#else
+               .udma_mask      = 0,
+#endif
+               .port_ops       = &bfin_pata_ops,
+       },
+};
MWDMA is never enabled (even if CONFIG_PATA_BF54X_DMA=y) but the driver
contains MWDMA support...
c.

+
+       ATAPI_SET_INT_STATUS(base, mask);

udelay() between retries?
d.
* write_atapi_register()
* read_atapi_register()
* write_atapi_data()
* read_atapi_data()
and
* wait_complete()
need a proper documentation (DocBook-ized etc).
Thanks,
Bart
