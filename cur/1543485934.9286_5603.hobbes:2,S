I have checked atrun and cron and neither of the job schedulers have
anything running (to the best of my LIMITED knowledge.)  I keep getting
lines like this in my /var/.../messages file.

Heh, I understand the telnet daemon and logins, but what I cannot figure
out is what the hell `--MARK--` < is?
It comes every 20 minutes?  And only when the computer is not being used.
 I mean only when a user is logged in
and "away" from the terminal or the telnet is sitting in the background
in Windows.
I thought that it might have something to do with SAMBA, but I have read
the docs and seen nothing which discusses this.
