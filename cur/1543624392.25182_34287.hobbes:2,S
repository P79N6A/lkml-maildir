Yeep. As an added bonus it's error prone, if some implementation of this
method forgets to cut and paste the fallback code.
You noticed the way I made at least the file_operations dispatcher
looking "opaque" recently? Most visible was the vanishment of
dome
if (ban->bang == NULL)
     bang = default1
if (ban->bang == NULL)
     bang = default1
if (ban->bang == NULL)
     bang = default1
if (ban->bang == NULL)
     bang = default1
if (ban->bang == NULL)
     bang = default1
if (ban->bang == NULL)
     bang = default1
....
orgy upon "disk" initialization...

Yes I know ;-). I have just removed some other twice callers for
other stuff. Do you know for example that I'm about 90% sure that
cleanup hooks for the device category drivers can be called twice.
Or that adding just a single drive reiterates every one on the system?
First I will try to change the way disks get iterated. This is
becouse disks are the main object in the whole driver and not
the host chip channels... Look for the plenty loops with
MAX_HWIFS as upper bound to see what I mean.
"Tune" is a silly name as well BTW. It has nothing to do with
attaching of carbon fiber to cars. It's host chip initialization, which
is going on.
