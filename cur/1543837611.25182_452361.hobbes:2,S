Debian works the best in my experience.  Yum sucks rocks, it's a pain
to configured and when it does pull in stuff, it pulls in *everything*
that you don't want.  
Not that apt-get is perfect, but it works well.  My main machine at
home is an old Debian Stable install upgraded pretty much daily.
Rarely do things break.  And rarely do you want packages updated
without you thinking about it.  
If you need to maintain a bunch of systems, all at the same rev, then
you will obviously need a master system to test on and from which to
push updates to the clients.  In this case, you'd setup your own
private repository which the clients would pull from.

I tried gentoo a bunch of years ago and didn't like it, and it
certainly didn't give me the speedup it claimed it would have.  I've
been happy with Debian.  Thinking about Ubuntu more...

This has nothing to do with the kernel, it's all a userspace issue.

Again, userspace completely.  You're asking for policy in the kernel,

*bwah hah hah!*  And you think they'll get it right?  So what happens
when two packages, call them A and B, have a circular dependency on
each other?  Who wins then?
It's not as simple an issue as you think.
