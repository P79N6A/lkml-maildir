The behaviour I am talking about is when there is a heavily contended
spinlock, and more than one task is trying to obtain it. Since SCHED_YIELD
only changes the goodness when we are trying to reschedule the task we
can bounce between two or more tasks doing sched_yield() for a while before
finally running the task that has the spinlock.
Of course with short lived spinlocks you should rarely get the case where
a task grabs a spinlock just before its timeslice is up, so maybe the answer
is just to spin a few times on sched_yield() then back off to nanosleep()
like pthreads does.
