In my kernel, it was a SIGKILL to a forking kernel thread that caused 
the problem. While I see SIGKILLs being sent to some kernel threads, I 
don't know if any of the kernel threads ever fork. If they don't, 
barring a demented root user sending SIGKILLs to kernel threads, I don't 
know if anyone else will ever see this. So, I don't have any problems 
with it being fixed post 2.6.9.
