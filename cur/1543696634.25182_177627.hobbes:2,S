Well, that person is me and I tried making it work with ide-cd. Got read
support to work, submitted to Jens, you have it in your kernel. No luck
with write support. I could get it to mount read-write and data actually
made it to disk, but umount lead to a BUG_ON. Details in:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0305.0/1307.html
(the patch in there won't apply due to minor renaming of flags and the
fact that the read support part is already in your tree)
So I'm not only complaining. ;)
