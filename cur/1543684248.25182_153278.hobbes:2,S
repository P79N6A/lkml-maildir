Hello!
I was just joking around here, but what do you think about this idea:
A proc interface for module handling:
   /proc/mods/
   /proc/mods/<module-name>/<link-to-the-modules-use-us>
So we could try to load a module with
   mkdir /proc/mods/ipv6
and remove it and every module which uses us with
   rm -r /proc/mods/ipv6
Modul options could be passed my
   echo "psmouse_noext=1" > /proc/mods/psmouse/options
which would also make it possible to change module options while running..
It's just an idea, perhaps someone likes this..
perhaps if there is enough feedback I even could think about
implementing it.
Greetings'
Nico
