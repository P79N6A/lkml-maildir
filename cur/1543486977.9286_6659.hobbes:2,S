The suggestion below is almost self-explanatory. Since calibrate_tsc 
now returns 2^28 * (nS/TSC), and you want/need 2^32 * (nS/TSC) ......
I don't have a PPS to test with (and built it without CONFIG_NTP_PPS), but 
I can check the phase fairly accurately against the cmos rtc and getting 
the same results as with normal kernel.
I'm wondering if you can't dispense with the 2^28 normalization (vs 2^32) 
alltogether.  What's the rationale for that?

We need a kernel module to do the taxes for us.  Then uncle sam can just
audit the kernel list and not bother us about it.
One other little detail. In kernel/time.c, around line 311, PPS_FAVG is 
used even though it's only defined inside an #ifdef CONFIG_NTP_PPS 
conditional.  I just defined it outside the #ifdef for this compile.
