The B* cruft has to be maintained.
But it would be POSIX complaint for B9600 to be #defined to B9600, and
B19200 to be #defined to B19200.
What would scare me though about doing something like would be
potential for the ABI changes.  Not only do you have to worry about a
consistent set of ioctl's, structure definitions, and B* defines, but
you also have to worry about userspace libraries that use B* as part
of their interface, and expect user programs to pass B* constants to
the userspace library.  (Say, some kind of conveience dialout library,
for example.)
In that case, the application could have been compiled with the
new-style termios.h, but the userspace library could have been
compiled with the old-style termios.h, and hence the old-style ioctl
definitions, and the opportunities for mischief are endless.
