rxvt-unicode (mixed fonts, bad complex script), and mlterm (no mixed
fonts, very good complex script support), are not all bloated, have a
_much_ smaller memory footprint than xterm and are even faster on text
output and scrolling complex scripts than xterm (by a factor of two).
(Of course, gnome-terminal is bloated. loading it requires 45MB of main
memory here and then it's still 5-10 times slower than xterm).
That UTF-8/Unicode in any way means bloated (I know you did not directly
imply this) is a widely circulating but wrong idea nowadays.
