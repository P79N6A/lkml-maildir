or use kmalloc() all the time allocating pollfds in chunks, like I
described in previous message. In fact, this morning I mailed to
Alan privately mentioning three approaches -
  a) my very first attempt (kmalloc if <128K, vmalloc otherwise)
     not a good idea for fragmentation reasons, as you say.
  b) chunk-ed allocation (so far I believe is the best)
  c) adjusting slab to allow 256K (see my earlier patch, again a bad
     idea for the same reasons as a).
So, unless I see something definitely superior to b) I am going to do it.
Regards,
Tigran.
