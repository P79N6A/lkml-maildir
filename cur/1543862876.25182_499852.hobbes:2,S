Hi Randy,
It's ok.
Thanks for reply.
I have one doubt in this regard.
1) once we connected to the serial console we don't
   want to login into the shell.
   (without login into the shell we want to fire the
   sysrq command like b, r m, etc.)
 for this I am doing like 
  grabing the serial console then
  doing ctrl+]
  so that getting 
              telnet> 
now i want to give command like b, m ,r etc.
but it is not accepting my commands until I do 
telnet> send brk
can you please explain me why like this behavior ?
Thanks
