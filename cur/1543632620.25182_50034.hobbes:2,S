Subject: [PATCH][2.5] wait for devices to wake up before mounting root, but don't hang

Don't hang while waiting for root device to come up
Someone mentioned that USB devices etc. can't be used for root fs since 
it's probably not yet available at boot time. This approach is broken, for 
sure, but it's at least supposed to rescue a small part of the whole (if 
you see a panic, you know something went atree).
