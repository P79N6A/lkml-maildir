Are you responding to me here, or to the previous statement?
I admit that I may have made a mistake in how I said some things, and 
may have confused some people about how I feel about M$.
M$ is not all bad. Some of their productsa re good. Without M$s efforts 
in the past Linux couldn't be as successful as it is, b/c M$ made the 
IBM clones very cheap, by licensing their products they made PCs into a 
huge market.
(Yes, it could be argued that somebody else could have taken their 
place, their niche. _PLEASE_, try to understand my general points, 
instead of nitpicking inconsequential points.)
I have a problem with M$ getting into the application business, and with 
their insistence on making mediocre software and then bundling it w/ 
Windows. I wish they would focus on their operating system and make it 
good, make it right.
Now it is also arguable that perhaps their is little money in pure 
kernel/OS. And they can make more money w/ apps. But other companies 
have to sell their products by the merits. M$ just sells their name. 
Good for business. bad for customers. Sometimes I think that M$ could 
sell us programs made by monkeys and still make money, as long as the 
programs work w/ Windows (presumably the OS couldn't be by monkeys, 
there has to be something of quality to sell).
