Yes, MIPS and ARM do different thing on partial cache line.  But I
suppose this belongs to "implementation dependent" area of DMA API so
users of the API should not depend on it.  (Well, maybe I'm biased to
MIPS ;-))
In general, drivers must not put normal data and DMA buffer on same
cacheline anyway to avoid unexpected writeback and data loss.  So this
ambiguity is not a problem.  IMHO writeback of the partial line for
DMA_FROM_DEVICE just _hides_ abusing of the DMA API and potential data
loss.
