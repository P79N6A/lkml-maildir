Subject: Try #3: UML has been sent to Linus again
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/1/13/127

This patch is against 2.5.2-pre11 and is available at 
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/user-mode-linux/uml-patch-2.5.2-pre11.bz2
It's also available from the other UML mirrors - they are listed at 
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/dl-sf.html
This UML is the same as the 2.4.17-5 patch.
Note - Ingo's scheduler has broken UML in a fairly fundamental way by holding
IRQs off across a context switch.  See my separate LKML post for the gory
details.
