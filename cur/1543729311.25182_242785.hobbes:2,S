You can read it both ways, right? It's easy.
I can't even see the difference unless I'm
looking for it.
We don't need any more bureaucracy.
do_this(a,b);
do_this(a, b);
do_this (a,b);
do_this (a, b);
I can read them all. I might notice the space in
front of the '(', but I might not. Even putting a
space in front of the ';' isn't unreadable.
People will pass laws until they are choked off,
unable to move without being in violation of some
silly little thing.
