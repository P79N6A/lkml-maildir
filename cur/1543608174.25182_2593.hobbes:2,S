No, you are not missing anything and I did consider the other part of your
patch, but was not brave enough to apply it when the kernel was "frozen".
However, the freeze lasted much longer than I expected :-)
I guess the original intention was that we would be able to add
capablilites to executable (much as we add setuid bits) and to users, but
that also seems to have taken a while to emerge.  I think, though, that I
have seen a PAM module for adding capabilities to users at login time.
