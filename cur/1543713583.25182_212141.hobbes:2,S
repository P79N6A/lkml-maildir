Subject: [patch 0/3] memory hotplug prototype

This is an updated version of memory hotplug prototype patch, which I
have posted here several times.
Main changes are:
	* Changes to make hotpluggable normal zones possible:
		* Added two fields (removable, enabled) to pglist_data.
		* Added __GFP_HOTREMOVABLE macro for page caches and
	          anonymous pages.
		* Added an element to node_zonelists[].
		  node_zonelists[3] is for __GFP_HOTREMOVABLE.
	* node_zonelists[] are calculated using pgdat->removable and
	  pgdat->enabled.  zone_active[] checks have been removed.
	* Remap code has been cleaned up, to share code with hugepage
          handling and better readability.
	* Some hack to work better under high IO load. (incomplete)
	* Changed page remapping rollback detection logic not to use
	  PG_again bit as suggested by Dave Hansen in
	  lhms-devel@sourceforge.  PG_again is left for consistency
	  checks. (not tested well)
	* Added an argument to remap_onepage() specifying a node to
          allocate replacement pages. (NUMA support, incomplete)
/proc/memhotplug interface has been changed. For example:
        # echo plug 1 > /proc/memhotplug
		Plugs node 1.
        # echo enable 1 > /proc/memhotplug
		Enables page allocation from node 1.
        # echo disable 1 > /proc/memhotplug
		Disables page allocation from node 1.
        # echo remap 5 > /proc/memhotplug
		Free pages in zone 5 by remapping.
        # echo unplug 1 > /proc/memhotplug
		Unplugs node 1. (All pages must be freed in advance)
	$ cat /proc/memhotplug
	Node 0 enabled nonhotremovable
		DMA[0]: free 250, active 940, present 4096
		Normal[1]: free 307, active 101623, present 126976
	Node 1 enabled hotremovable
		Normal[5]: free 336, active 9287, present 83968
		HighMem[6]: free 88, active 14406, present 45056
Known issues/TODO items:
	* kswapd doesn't terminate when a node is unplugged.
	* Currently, a page is written back to disk before remapping
          if it has a dirty buffer.  This can be too slow, so
	  such pages needs to be handled without issueing writebacks.
	  I guess this would require a new vfs interface.
My patch consists of 3 files:
	1. memoryhotplug.patch
		The main patch.
		
	2. va-emulation_memhotplug.patch
		to emulate hotpluggable memory blocks on usual PC.
	3. va-proc_memhotplug.patch
		/proc/memhotplug interface.
They are sent as followups to this mail and will be followed by
Takahashi's hugetlbfs page remapping patches shortly.
