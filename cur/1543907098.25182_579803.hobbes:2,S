My reading of the maintainers file is that
sound/usb/usbmixer.c belongs to perex@suse.cz
but I got no response to this message, so I am
resending it here.

Following the suggestion in this thread:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/
+source/alsa-lib/+bug/26683
the correct upper bound on desc[0] is 5 + num_ins not 6 + num_ins,
because the index used later is 5+i, not 6+i.
This change makes my Vosky Chatterbox speakerphone work.
Apparently it also helps with the Minivox MV100.
