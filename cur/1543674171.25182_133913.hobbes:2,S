sure, i'm all for it, but in a different pass, and after syncing up with
glibc. An API cleanup like this should have been done upon the
introduction of futexes, why didnt you comment on this then? Splitting off
FUTEX_REQUEUE in isolation is quite pointless.

glibc. We do not want to handle all the misaligned cases for obvious
reasons. The use of u32 (instead of a native word) is a bit unfortunate on
64-bit systems but now a reality.
