What would be the best approach to track down the problem?
I've recovered 99% of my system.
(rpm -V is a wonderful thing together with wget).
I intend to convert my root filesystem from reiserfs to xfs tomorrow
for the purposes of testing (and because I've had too many problems with 
reiser over time). Should I do this, and re-test TCQ to avoid any reiser 
problems, or should I stick with the current setup and do more testing as 
needed. I'll have to figure out some precautions if so :)
How can I help? 
On the good side, fs corruption dug out 10 gigs of free space
I never would have thought were available....cleanup for free.
