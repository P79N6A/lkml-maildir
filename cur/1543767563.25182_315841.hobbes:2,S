I don't know if it works, just that it's listed in:
ppc, arm, sh, cris, arm26, m68k, ppc64, parisc, m32r, frv,
and sh64.  and i386.

Are you saying that zImage still fails (image is too large?) ?
I built one, but I wouldn't want to boot it.  :)
It looks like you would need to put almost everything into
an initrd to make it usable.
