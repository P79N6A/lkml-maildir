   The console driver itself can be changed to support multihead very easily
(except for a few places like console blanking it's sufficient to redefine
the IS_FG and IS_VISIBLE macros), but the console ioctl's and fbcon need
some serious work since they expect only one console can be active at a time.
   Vojtech's input patches contain some parts of my multihead console work,
but since then I didn't have enough free time to continue... :(
				Have a nice fortnight
