I don't know why. The problem is that you can't really evaluate good
proposals by looking at the code (you can say that one is bad, ie. the
current one, which has a huge amount of temporal complexity and is
explicitly unfair), but it is pretty hard to say one behaves well.
And my scheduler for example cuts down the amount of policy code and
code size significantly. I haven't looked at Con's ones for a while,
but I believe they are also much more straightforward than mainline...
For example, let's say all else is equal between them, then why would
we go with the O(logN) implementation rather than the O(1)?
