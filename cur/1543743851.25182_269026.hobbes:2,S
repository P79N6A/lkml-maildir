Of course nobody likes to throw away hard work. However, code that isn't
used tends to be unmaintained. So it might be outdated when (and if)
it gets used in the future. A web page indexed by search engines is a
excellent way to preserve knowledge.
The existence of unused code in the kernel will probably make not much
of a difference for future development. But it pollutes the source so
IMHO we could do without many of these:
$ find -name '*.[ch]' |xargs grep '^#if 0'|wc
