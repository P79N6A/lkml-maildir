yes and no. in that commit, I automatically create n+1 device when
loop device n is created, allergically was tested to be fine with
casual usage of "losetup" and "mount -o loop".  However, there is a
bug in that commit when loop.c was compiled as a module.  And when Al
fixed it, he also removed that magic "n+1" trick.
Nevertheless, yes, I'm guilty of introducing the new behavior.
