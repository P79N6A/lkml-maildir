Well...
In kernel 2.5.70 ide_ioreg_t typedef was removed from
<asm-m68k/hdreg.h> and it is used all over <asm-m68knommu/ide.h>.
I see that this is fixed in linux-m68k-cvs but...
<asm-m68knommu/ide.h> hasn't been updated since kernel 2.5.46
and still depends on inlines which were removed from IDE code:
- ide_request_irq() (special case for COLDFIRE)
- ide_{request, release}_region(),
  which are empty because M68K use memory IO
- ide_fix_driveid() (special case for COLDFIRE),
  conflicts with generic version in drivers/ide/ide-iops.c
- maybe more
This issues are not fixed in linux-m68k-cvs tree.
[ Is there a separate m68knommu tree? ]
I hope you now don't regret asking this question... ;-)
Cheers,
Bartlomiej
