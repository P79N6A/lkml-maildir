I'm glad you are working on it. The system I proposed is the same
thing that was done in VAX/VMS. There was never any need to upset
any timing anywhere because it was just BOOTTIME + OFFSET +
uFORTNIGHT-tick = (quadword) time.
A more modern version for Linux would "simplicate and add lightness",
as well as get rid of the:
    warning:  Clock skew detected.  Your build may be incomplete.
...from `make` as a result of more-and-more-usual time jumps.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
