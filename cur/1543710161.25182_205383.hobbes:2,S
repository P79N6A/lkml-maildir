Hmmm. What is linear text? Is it okay to auto-wrap i

dle of text, not on white-space boundaries, like it
does when somebody just streams out a bunch of bytes?

The pine mailer that I use, uses pico as its editor. When I attempt
to write a response that has previous quotes, the stuff that doesn't
fit on a line just piles up at the end of the window. It gets replaced
by a '$' so you know that there is more text. `vi` isn't so kind.
You don't know what's hidden unless you put a new-line in at the
end or want to space to the right up to 4094 bytes (it allows lines
to be that long, last I checked). With vi, you get a line of text like thi
You don't know what's beyond the 'i' of "thi", above. It might
be several hundred important words so you need to space the cursor
over there and look beyond the screen boundaries.
When you want text to be read by others, you make sure they
can read it. It's just that simple. There are some assumptions
that you can make. You can assume that they have a way of
reading 80-column text, for instance.
