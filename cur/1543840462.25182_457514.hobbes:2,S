The main question still is if it is correct to add softirq/hardirq time
to the system time of a process. If the answer turns out to be yes, then
it might be a clever idea to account softirq time to the softirqd. That
still leaves the question what to do with hardirq time ..
My take still is that softirq/hardirq time does not belong to the system
time of any process.
