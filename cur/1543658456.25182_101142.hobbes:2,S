You need a good one. But good can be simplistic, is what I'm saying.
DTMF was designed to be easy to decode reliably. Complex doesn't automatically 
mean better.
I remember reading a more specific version of the message I pointed a pointer 
to, but couldn't find it back. But it came down to the devil being in the details.
It probably pays to have someone look at this with old hardware experience in 
this. Telco newsgroup perhaps.
