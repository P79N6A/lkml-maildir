Sounds we can't add lock here. pci_bus_sem is a semaphore, but the api
can be called within a spinlock and maybe with interrupt disabled. On
the other hand, there is no hotplug risk here. The pdev is in use (the
driver is doing dma buf allocation) when the api is called, so it's
parent can't be hotpluged too. If you feel others misuse the api, we
could move it to intel_iommu.c.
