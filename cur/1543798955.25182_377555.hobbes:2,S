What's more important is that acpi is doing something fundamentally stupid
here.  Putting a lock into a separate allocation (and the allocator wrapped
again..) is just freaking stupid, period.
Someone needs to go through ACPI and rewrite this freaking junk into proper
linux code.  Maybe it'd even get less buggy if a single person finally had
a chance to actually understand all of the code after only half of it is
left ;-)

and a memset to it, WTF..  seems like the acpi people just need to be shot.
