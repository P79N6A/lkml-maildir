Ok, but if we unplug a device, then disconnect will be called even if we 
opened a sysfs file.
Couldn't be a race between the moment we read our private data and check 
it is valid and the moment we use it :
Process A (read/write sysfs file) 		Process B (disconnect)
recover our private data from struct device
check it is valid
						free our private data
do operation on private data

Yes I know, but fewer possible opps won't hurt ;)
