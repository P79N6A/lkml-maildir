If you are running the stock driver in 8.0, that could explain things.
More recent drivers can be found here:
http://people.FreeBSD.org/~gibbs/linux/RPM/aic79xx/
http://people.FreeBSD.org/~gibbs/linux/DUD/aic79xx/
http://people.FreeBSD.org/~gibbs/linux/SRC/
The driver in RH8.0 is probably almost a year out of date.
