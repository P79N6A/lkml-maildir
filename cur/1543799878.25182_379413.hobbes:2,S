here we go to great trouble trying to avoid the 'slowpath', while we 
unconditionally force the next unlock into the slowpath! So we have not 
won anything. (on a cycle count basis it's probably even a net loss)
The same applies to atomic_dec_return() based trylock variant. Only the 
cmpxchg based one, and the optimized ARM variant should be used as a 
'fastpath'.
another thing is that this solution still leaves that ugly #ifdef in 
kernel/mutex.c.
so i took a different solution that solves both problems. The API 
towards architectures is now:
 static inline int
 __mutex_fastpath_trylock(atomic_t *count, int (*fn)(atomic_t *))
note the new 'fn' parameter: this enables mutex-null.h to do a simple:
 #define __mutex_fastpath_trylock(count, fn_name)        fn_name(count)
and the final ugly debugging related #ifdef is gone from kernel/mutex.c!  
Furthermore, both the mutex-xchg.h and the mutex-dec.h non-cmpxchg 
variant will fall back to the spinlock implementation.
