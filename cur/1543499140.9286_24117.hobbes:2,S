My design decision was to cleanly separate the Serial Bus Management
and Transaction Layer from the Link Layer.  Bus management and
transaction are common for all hardware except the following case:

Yes, but that is IMHO not a reason for reimplementing bus management
and transaction in every hardware driver and thus keeping around
multiple parallel implementations of the same thing.  This intelligent
hardware you are talking about probably doesn't need a real subsystem
anyway.
It's like a network card with inbuilt TCP/IP - and that's not supported
by Linux either.  Also, including bypasses in a general system is
probably a lot easier than have the same thing implemented in n places
(meaning n places of failure and bugs) just because some little detail
may differ.

I put quite some thoughts into abstracting the interfaces from the
hardware but to allow hardware optimizations like CRCing and byte
swapping without preferring a type of hardware.
Basically the transmit request passes the hpsb_packet structure to the
hardware driver, which contains a pointer to header data, a pointer to
block data and their sizes.  The data is kmalloc'd so you can directly
DMA out of there, the contents can be overwritten for software byte
swapping and there is space for an additional quadlet for software CRC. 
Which means it is not dependent on hardware features but is still
easily handable like this function, which sends the next packet on a
Lynx:
 /* This must be called with the async_queue_lock held. */
 static void send_next_async(struct ti_lynx *lynx)
 {
         struct ti_pcl pcl;
         struct hpsb_packet *packet = lynx->async_queue;
 
         pcl.next = PCL_NEXT_INVALID;
         pcl.async_error_next = PCL_NEXT_INVALID;
 #ifdef __BIG_ENDIAN
         pcl.buffer[0].control = PCL_CMD_XMT | packet->header_size;
 #else
         pcl.buffer[0].control = PCL_CMD_XMT | packet->header_size 
                 | PCL_BIGENDIAN;
 #endif
         pcl.buffer[0].pointer = virt_to_bus(packet->header);
         pcl.buffer[1].control = PCL_LAST_BUFF | packet->data_size;
         pcl.buffer[1].pointer = virt_to_bus(packet->data);
 
         if (!packet->data_be) {
                 pcl.buffer[1].control |= PCL_BIGENDIAN;
         }
 
         put_pcl(lynx, lynx->async_pcl, &pcl);
         run_pcl(lynx, lynx->async_pcl_start, 3);
 }
That's all there is to sending a new packet on its way.  Would this
example be harder to implement on an Adaptec?  If so, why?
Ok, this design is not so optimal for chips that do not support
scatter/gather DMA, their drivers would have to copy the data.

Your own memory allocation system was not neccessary, for example.  As
far as I can see memory management is set up early before any other
drivers and unlike SCSI there is no ISA hardware to be supported. 
Standard alloc functions should do it nicely.

No problem, for testing purposes I had two Lynxen in my system and they
both got recognized, initialized and used.  No problem for more or
different cards (other than that I don't have any driver other than the
Lynx driver).

Noone really likes it, but it is there and rewriting it would be a lot
of work.  It's just that nobody yet stood up and volunteered.

Look, I looked around your code and have a fairly good idea of how it
works.  Maybe you should download my patch and take a closer look at it
and see how I do things.  Judging from some of your concerns I don't
think you did already.

I get paid, but I can not work full time on this.

Heh - not before isochronous transmission works and the whole thing
runs on StrongARM CPUs :-)
