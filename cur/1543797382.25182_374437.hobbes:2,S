From:Mr James Collins.
Abidjan,Republic of Cote d'ivoire.
Attention,
I have a proposal for you-this however is 
not mandatory nor will I in any manner compel you to
honour
against your will.
I am Mr. James Collins 24years old and the only Son of
my
late parents Mr.and Mrs.Bamba. My father was a highly
reputable busnness magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who
operated in
the capital of Ivory coast during his days. It is sad
to
say that he passed away mysteriously in France during
one
of his business trips abroad on the 12th.Febuary
2003.Though his sudden death was linked or rather
suspected
to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who
travelled
with him at that time.But God knows the truth!
My mother died when I was just 6 years old,and since
then
my father took me so special. Before his death on
Febuary 12 2003 he called mesecretly to accompanied
him to the hospital and told methat he has the sum of
Ten million,seven hundred thousand
United State Dollars.(USD$10.700,000) left in fixed
deposit account inone of the leading banks in Africa.
He further told me that he deposited the money in my
name,and finally issued a
written instruction to his lawyer whom he said is in
possession of all the necessary but legal documents to
this
fund and the bank.
I am just 24 years old and a university undergraduate
and
really don't know what to do.Now I want an account
overseas
where I can transfer this funds. This is because I
have
suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant
political crisis here in Ivory coast.The death of my
father
actually brought sorrow to my life. I am in a sincere
desire of your humble assistance in this regards.Your
suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded.
Now permit me to ask these few questions:-
1. Can you honestly help me as your Son?
2. Can I completely trust you?
3. What percentage of the total amount in question
will be
good for 
you after the money is in your account?
Please,Consider this and get back to me as soon as
possible.
Thank you so much.
My sincere regards.
James Collins.
