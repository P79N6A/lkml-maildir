I actually doubt it will cause problems.
We made much bigger changes to ptrace support when we disallowed writing 
to read-only shared memory areas (we used to do the magic per-page COW 
thing).
But if people have test-cases for ptrace and/or other magical users of 
access_vm_pages() (things like core-dumping comes to mind - although I 
think we don't dump pure file mappings at all, do we?) it would certainly 
be good to run any such tests on the current -git tree...
