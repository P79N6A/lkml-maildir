You don't want to do that.
There was a reason why the scheduler decided to move the task.
Now, because of monitoring you would change the behavior of the task
and scheduler.
Monitoring should be unintrusive. You want the task/scheduler to
behave as if no monitoring
was present otherwise what is it you are actually measuring?
Changing or forcing the affinity because of monitoring is also a bad
idea, for the same reason.
