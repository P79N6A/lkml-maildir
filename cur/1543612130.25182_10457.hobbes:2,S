In binutils? This sounds more like kernel should do it...
If all .text.exit functions were not static, it would be pretty easy to do,
but I guess they are usually static. In that case, I think it would take
about 1 day hacking an libelf program, which would rewrite all object files
which are going to be linked into vmlinux, which would add a new SHN_UND symbol to
each .symtab/.strtab (say __devexit_called) and change all relocs against
symbols in .text.exit sections to this symbol instead.
Maybe even it would take even less time, it is not that hard.
