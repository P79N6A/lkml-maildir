Hi,
   I am not able to compile io_apic.c file .
   The Linux kernel version is 2.2.5-22
   The procedure I followed to compile is :
   I included the  CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC which I found in 
   /linux/arch/i386/kernel/Makefile in /usr/src/linux/.config and
   in /linux/include/linux/autoconf.h
   I did a make depend 
   Then I did make bzImage
   This started giving errors as :
   io_apic.c : In function `find_irq_entry':
   io_apic.c : 278 : invalid use of undefined type `struct
mpc_config_intsrc'
   io_apic.c : At top level:
   io_apic.c : 98 : sorage of `mp_irq' isnt't known
   can some please help me out.
  with regards,
      Anil
