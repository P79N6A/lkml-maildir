I recommend to fix the obvious sparc breakage, before changing the
softirq code in any way, to make sure not to hide the scheduler bug.
Ah, and let me bet, the sparc32 scheduler breakage is that it's not
running schedule_tail in ret_from_fork (you must
s/ret_from_smpfork/ret_from_fork/ as well). Since 2.4 it's not a SMP
thing any longer, it is _required_ on UP too or sched yield will break
badly!  This of course is a problem not just for spwan_ksoftirqd, but
it's a core bug that triggers all the time with the sparc32 userspace
too.
