I will now keep watching for q while quietly. Earlier today I had
another such hard lockup, identical errors claiming a disk failure.
This time I went into the BIOS on bootup and the clock was set
correctly. Good. Booted and it did the usual fscks but then dropped
into a shell when errors were found on /. I did the necessary fscks.
On a hunch I did 'date' and the clock was 11h ahead (we actually
are +11 now). So the problem is during the boot, not during the
crash. I consider that the boot thinks that I am running a UTC
hwclock and adjusts for this, when in fact I run a local time
hwclock. There must be something in the scripts that goes funny
if / does an fsck and then drops into the recovery shell.
I will start looking in this direction.
This is Debian Sarge in x86.
Thanks
