hmm not sure where I got that from i'll fix thanks.

For device enumeration, I see a daemon as necessary.  The main goal of 
this work is to solve the out-of-order execution of sbin/hotplug and 
improve performance of the system during device enumeration with 
significant (200 disks, 4 partitions each) amounts of devices.  Boot 
time with this scheme appears, in my rudimentary tests, to be faster on 
the order of 1-2 seconds for bootup for the case of just 12 disks.  I 
would imagine 200 disks (which I don't have a good way to test, as I 
don't have 200 disks:) would provide better speed gains during bootup.  
This compares greg's original udev to this patched udev binary.

I agree there should be some way of limiting events.  I'll add this set 
of code.

devfs is not appropriate as it does not allow for complex policy with 
external attributes that the kernel is unaware of.  For an example, lets 
take the situation where a policy must access a cluster-wide manager to 
determine some information before it can make a policy decision.  For 
that to occur, there must be sockets, and hopefully libc, which puts the 
entire thing in user space.  Who would want to write policies in the 
kernel?  uck.
