If you care about this kind of order, you would first need to eliminate the
ability of doing low level things like SG_IO from block drivers as this is 
similar low level stuff that rather belongs to low level drivers.
Any driver that allows to use low level interfaces to send RAW SCSI commands
also needs access to other lowlevel stuff like the ability to know the 
max. DMA size.
