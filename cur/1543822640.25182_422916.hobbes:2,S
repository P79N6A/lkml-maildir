It's certainly not as simple as you make it sound, if you want to
support existing kernels without having to guess how the kernel image
was built.
I've updated our loader to support this now, so that this patch is
no longer necessary.  I have at the same time added a new field to
xen_guest which allows specifying the entry point, allowing us to have
a different entry point when running the kernel image on Xen.
