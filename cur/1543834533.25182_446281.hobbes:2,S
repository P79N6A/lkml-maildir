Dear Beloved, 
 Heavenly Greetings,How are you hope you are keeping 
healthy,permitte me to ask you if you are in full time ministerial word?
is your ministry into humaniterian activities?. 
Let me quickly 
introduce myself as Mrs Elizabeth Ann,married to Mr. David backhaus,a 
German based business man in Togo,who until his death was a timber 
export marchant here in the republic of Togo(lome). 
It's a sorrowful 
thing to say that he died in a fatal motor accident alongside with our 
only son on the 19th of may 2004, while cominig back from a business 
meeting.(God knows best).When my husband was alive,He deposited his 
life's savings (u.s $3 million) with a bank here in the republic of 
Togo, with my name as the next of kin. 
As God may have it, recently 
I was diagonised of liver cancer, and the doctors said i have just six 
months to live.In view of my condition, and the fact that i have nobody 
to leave this money behind for, with the exception of my husband people 
who are not Christains,I decided to donate this money to either a 
living Church or a humaniterian organization that will use this money 
in propagating the good massage and also taking care of the orphans,
widows, and the needy generally.( 2Cor: 4:6-18-17 ).By so doing,I would 
have susceeded in immortalising the names of my late Husband and my 
only Son. Beloved,though I am sick and dying, I am not afraid of death 
because I know were Iam going.
Mey soul has found a resting place in 
the handsome bossom of the lord.Who shall seperate us from the love of 
christ?shall tribulation,or persecution- -- -Rom 8:28-38 vs 35 As soon 
as I receive your reply,Iwill give you the contact of the bank and all 
the legal documents that would warrant the transfer of the fund to you. 
please understand that this massage requires urgency as my ill-health 
demands. 
Any delay in your response will give me room to contact 
other person,I also want an assurance that you will use this fund for 
the purpose I have stated herein.Hope to hearing from you. 
Your 
Sister In Christ. 
Mrs Elizabeth Ann.
