No, because an undefined symbol does not have an address associated with
it.  So, it looks like this:
         U symbol
More than one blank space at the beginning, U, then one space and the
symbol.  On binutils built on 32-bit architectures, 9 spaces prefixing
the 'U'.  On 64-bit architectures, 17 spaces prefixing the 'U'.
(Yes, even a cross-built binutils building for a 32-bit architecture
on a 64-bit architecture gives you 64-bit addresses.)
Does the format _really_ matter this much?
