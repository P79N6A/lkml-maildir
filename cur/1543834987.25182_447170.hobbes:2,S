I'd like to encourage including the patch:
  Cpuset: fix ABBA deadlock with cpu hotplug lock
in 2.6.18-rc2-mmx.  This patch was sent to lkml,
copied to akpm, 14 July.  It was sent again to lkml,
in response to a request for a copy from Linus, on
23 July, copied again to akpm.
Granted, the case for including it is not absolute.
The fix is simple enough and fixes a definite deadlock,
as verified by testing results on the system that was
seeing this deadlock.
However ... only one system, world-wide, has the magic
workload to provoke this deadlock, so far.  And it involves
the cpu hotplug lock, which perhaps Linus would like to
nuke entirely.
