Hi, just wanted to recommend that this goes in, in one form or another  -  it
would help a lot around here.  Today we have to manually "fix" the kernel
source to get proper core.[executable] naming of core dumps.
I haven't looked at the patch though.  I don't know if it meets the standards,
but the functionaly it provides (or was meant to provide) would definitely be a
life-saver for me.   And it would put an end to the quarrels about core dump
naming   :)
Thanks,
