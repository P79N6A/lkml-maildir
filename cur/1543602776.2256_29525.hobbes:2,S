Hi,
We are interested in finding out the overhead in kernel->user buffer copy and
vice-versa for disk reads and network writes resp. in copy_from_user() and
copy_to_user() calls. Are there any quantitative data available for this? We
plan to eliminate this overhead, if significant, in our integrated disk-read and
network-write architecture. Any pointers/references related to this type of
work?
TIA,
Murali.
