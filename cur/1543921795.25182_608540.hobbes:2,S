I looked at commit 20510f2f4e2dabb0ff6c13901807627ec9452f98
[havenot done much kernel activity recently] where you
transform the security interface, and what I see is that
all the static inline functions are replaced by an extern one, with the
same content. That actually seems to include more performance hit
than the (un)registering fluff. Why is that, actually?
