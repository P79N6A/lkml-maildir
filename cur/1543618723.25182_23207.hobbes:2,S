I would prefer instead just avoiding the copy altogether, and just save
the name pointer - with no length restrictions.
Right now the code has the comment
   /* Copy name over so we don't have problems with unloaded modules */
but that was written before "kmem_cache_destroy()" existed, and we should
long ago have fixed any modules that don't properly destroy their caches
when they exit (and yes, I know the difference between "should" and "did",
but that's not an excuse for a bad interface).
