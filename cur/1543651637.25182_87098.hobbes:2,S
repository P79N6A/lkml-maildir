I certainly don't disagree, but the one critical problem is writing the
dump to the right place, or at least not writing to the wrong place. I'd
love to have disk, net, NVram, whatever choices, but disk is the one which
would help the most. AIX and ISC have dump to swap, and the swapon copies
the data back or clears it, with a fresh O/S load to ensure writing the
right place.

Agreed, I would think about doing that with a mail server. But even an
oops like ksymoops would be helpful. I started on systems with dumps,
ksymoops is wonderful by comparison.

That could all be built as part of init, clearly you can't depend on
demand loading the module.

If the modules are to be really self-sufficient it would have to include
the driver. I'll let someone tell me that's not always the case if the
driver can have its own data area.

Yes, although with separate code, stack and data that's less likely. In
the bad old days self-modifying code was common.

The first part of that looks medium hard, particularly if the code has to
be part of the dump module.

Clearly it can be done even better than the current implementation, and
given an interface standard a replacement in the whole could be done.
