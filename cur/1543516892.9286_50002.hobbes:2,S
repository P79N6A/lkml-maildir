The movb is a smaller instruction, that's all.
There is no alignment problem -- spinlocks are always properly aligned.
If gcc is inserting .align 2 in ELF output, that should be because the
object/structure only requires 2 byte alignment.  I.e., the largest
element is a short.  .align 2 is perfectly normal in a.out output, where
it means "align to 1<<2".
