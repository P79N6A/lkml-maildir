I made a "failed" file, heres what i put in it for debugging :)
If i don't state errors then it patched/compiled/loaded as near cleanly as you can with a few steps of version between what your using.
r8169-dma-api-rx-buffers.patch - froze on ifconfig
r8169-dma-api-rx-buffers-ahum.patch - joined with above
r8169-rx_copybreak.patch - 3 HUNK failure on patch maybe due to first two failures
got kpanics on mac-phy patch after this and decided to send you this sooner
