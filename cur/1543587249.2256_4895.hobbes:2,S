You've found the missing memory: the fifth number is the number of pages
allocated for a cache: 125000 pages or 500 MB.
The first number is the number of allocated objects, the second number
is the total number of objects (the difference are preallocated
dentries/inodes to speed up further allocations and internal
fragmentation)
the third number is the size in bytes of one structure, then the number
of pages in use, and the total number of pages (the difference are
freeable pages that can be free by the memory pressure code)
The odd thing is that the inode cache is nearly twice as large as the
dentry cache.
Does that indicate a memory leak?
