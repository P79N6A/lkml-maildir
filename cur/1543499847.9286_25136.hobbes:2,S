I got the above error message while doing the following
some-random-machine:/# route add 192.168.166.20 lo
some-random-machine:/# route del 192.168.166.20 lo
This is on 2.3.5 w/devfs and pcmcia drivers.  The only other time
I've seen the message is with the pcmcia drivers, but I don't think 
they are related in to the pcmcia drivers in this situation though. (Maybe
I'm wrong).
