Yes, most daemons have the ability to switch user ID once they have 
bound tho the port.  Additionally, support is starting to show up for 
capabilities.  I know that ProFTPD has support.  Now, assuming it is 
running on a newer kernel, it never needs to be root, because it has 
been granted the capability to open a low port.  Even if it is cracked, 
it cannot do other things like . . . insert a kernel module, . . . 
overwrite /etc/passwd . . . . . etc
