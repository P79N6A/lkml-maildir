I only see a modification of req->sector in the !uptodate case.
I get 'correct' behaviour if I add the following line immediately before 
every occurrence of end_request(1) in my driver:
	CURRENT->sector += CURRENT->current_nr_sectors;
# dd if=nftl.c bs=512 of=/dev/nftla count=6
NFTL write request of 0x2 sectors @ 0 (CURRENT->nr_sectors == 6
NFTL write request completed OK
NFTL write request of 0x2 sectors @ 2 (CURRENT->nr_sectors == 6
NFTL write request completed OK
NFTL write request of 0x2 sectors @ 4 (CURRENT->nr_sectors == 6
NFTL write request completed OK
From 2.3.41:
int 
end_that_request_first( struct request *req, int uptodate, char *name ) 
{
        struct buffer_head * bh;
        int nsect;
        req->errors = 0;
        if (!uptodate) {
                printk("end_request: I/O error, dev %s (%s), sector %lu\n",
                        kdevname(req->rq_dev), name, req->sector);
                if ((bh = req->bh) != NULL) {
                        nsect = bh->b_size >> 9;
                        req->nr_sectors--;
                        req->nr_sectors &= ~(nsect - 1);
                        req->sector += nsect;
                        req->sector &= ~(nsect - 1);
                }
        }
        if ((bh = req->bh) != NULL) {
                req->bh = bh->b_reqnext;
                bh->b_reqnext = NULL;
                bh->b_end_io(bh, uptodate);
                if ((bh = req->bh) != NULL) {
                        req->current_nr_sectors = bh->b_size >> 9;
                        if (req->nr_sectors < req->current_nr_sectors) {
                                req->nr_sectors = req->current_nr_sectors;
                                printk("end_request: buffer-list destroyed\n");
                        }
                        req->buffer = bh->b_data;
                        return 1;
                }
        }
        return 0;
}

That's what I'm doing, modulo any stupid mistakes on my part - which is 
unlikely since this code hasn't changed for a while, and it worked before.

OK. I've replaced that with CURRENT->current_nr_sectors.

I think it would be a very good idea to include that in the kernel tree, as 
with drivers/net/skeleton.c.
Please could I have a copy?
