I've seen code written for X86 use MAP_FIXED to create self wrapping
ring buffers. Surely it's better to fail the mmap() on other archs
rather than for the code to fail in unexpected ways?
It's a bug either way ... either the test should be fixed up or it
should be removed from arch_get_unmapped_area() to save confusion.
