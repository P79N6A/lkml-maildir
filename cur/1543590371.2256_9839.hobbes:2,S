In _that_ respect, yes.  pci_pool_destroy() called in shutdown
context "should" be OK.  Getting rid of pages then is fine.

All agreed.

Two issues are mixed up there.  Doc should address both:
Documentation/pci.txt
    ... that remove() is never called in_interrupt
        point (2) above
Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt
    pci_free_consistent() -- do not call in_interrupt
        ... unless we bugfix the ARM behavior "soon"
    pci_pool_destroy() -- do not call in_interrupt
        ... normally called on device remove()
    pci_pool_free() -- may be called in_interrupt
        ... often called in device interrupt handling
Pete's patch deferred some pci_free_consistent calls from
pci_pool_free() where they're unsafe (on ARM) to where
they're safe (all architectures, as discussed above).
