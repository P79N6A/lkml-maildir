Well, yes, this was the original idea. Actually, what I really had in
mind when I introduced that command line was mainly single user mode.
As you can see, this has gotten a little bit out of hand now ...
With the option mania happily continuing, we'll probably have to raise
the current kernel limit of 256 characters.
Anyway, it's still better than passing obscure binary parameters in
the block at 0x90000 (load address of the floppy disk boot sector),
which is the original boot-time parameter interface, and which is
gradually becoming a private interface between setup.S and setup.c
