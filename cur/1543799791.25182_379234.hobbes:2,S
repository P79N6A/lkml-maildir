Great!  I'm glad you're amenable to such changes.  Especially the 
"remove the current semaphore implementation" part many people are 
complaining about for all sorts of reasons.

There is not only the question of cycles.  There is also kernel text 
size.  And _that_ is significant.  You could argue that only adding a 
function call for every mutex lock/unlock cannot be made smaller.  
However on ARM a function call is quite a costly operation with frame 
pointers, (and frame pointers are on by default on ARM otherwise the 
kernel is undebuggable).  So given that current semaphore fast path is 
inlined to save on the function call overhead, and given that on ARM the 
transition from semaphores to mutexes will shrink that from 8 
instruction down to 3 instructions, or even 2 instructions in some 
cases, will not only save cycles, but a bunch of kernel .text bytes as 
well without compromize on the cycle count.  This is therefore an all 
win situation for ARM.

Consider my text size argument above which is something I believe you 
value more.
