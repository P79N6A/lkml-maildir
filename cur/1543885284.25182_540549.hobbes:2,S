on top of
	make-cancel_rearming_delayed_work-reliable-spelling.patch
Add cpu-relax() into spinloops, and a comments update.
Small note. The new implementation has another downside. Suppose that rearming
work->func() gets a preemtion after setting WORK_STRUCT_PENDING but before
add_timer/__queue_work. In that case cancel_rearming_delayed_work() will burn
CPU in a busy-wait loop. Fortunately this can happen only with CONFIG_PREEMPT
and we spin with preemption enabled.
We can avoid this,
	void cancel_rearming_delayed_work(struct delayed_work *dwork)
	{
		int retry;
		do {
			retry = !del_timer(&dwork->timer) &&
				!try_to_grab_pending(&dwork->work);
			wait_on_work(&dwork->work);
		} while (retry);
		work_clear_pending(&dwork->work);
	}
but I don't think this is worth fixing.
