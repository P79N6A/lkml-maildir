I haven't reviewed it - sorry.  Too much stuff; too little time.
If only I had Alan's bots, which are apparently on loan now to Andrew.

I disagree.  If just one thing, like cpusets, does the ifdef's, it might
be easier to read.  But if several things do them in nearby code, that
code gets ugly and fries my limited brain circuits.
Even just one of them looks ugly to me -- changing what could be a
single indented line "cpuset_...(..);" line into three lines, two of
them violating the indentation.
It might look clearer to someone who is focused on that particular
change, but it adds unnecessary noise for the other 90% of the readers
of that code who are not concerned with cpusets at that point in time.
