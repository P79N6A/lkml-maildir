if memory serves me correctly (i can't find my 8th edition manual just at the
moment) both 8th and 9th were pretty conventional UNII
plan 9 came after the 9th edition
and inferno came after plan 9
The preface to the 8th edition says:
"It is an experimental system, not a commercial prototype, which incorporates
facilities from the Seventh Edition, System V, and Berkeley BSD 4.1"
The preface to the 9th talks about refining and paring. plan 9 is no refinment of
UNIX; it is a completely new model.
