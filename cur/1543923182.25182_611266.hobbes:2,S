There was a followup in the bugzilla:

So its not the standard bootloader, its one which passes an ATAG
commandline and 2.6.23 onwards uses an ATAG commandline if present over
the compiled in commandline.
My opinion is that this is a feature. Recompile the bootloader without
the commandline if you want to use the one compiled into the kernel.
This is going to be useful in the future when booting Zaurus kernels
with kexec since it means we can customise the commandline through the
ATAGs.
Cheers,
Richard
