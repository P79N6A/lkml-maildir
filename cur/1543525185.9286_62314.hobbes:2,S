Any similar recommendations for Alpha patches?  The last several kernels
won't compile on my Jensen machine (Alpha) because it does not have PCI and
something somewhere is demanding PCI support.  2.3.42 compile failed with
this:
make[1]: Entering directory `/home/root/lx-23x/arch/alpha/kernel'
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/home/root/lx-23x/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O3
-fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -mno-fp-regs -ffixed-8
-mcpu=ev4 -Wa,-mev6   -DEXPORT_SYMTAB -c alpha_ksyms.c

Usually it gives some error at the end of "make boot" with references to some
kind of pci hose blah blah blah...
Thanks,
Scott
