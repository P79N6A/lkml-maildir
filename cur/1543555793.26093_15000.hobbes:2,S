Thanks for this....
I have looked more deeply, and discovered the error of my ways.
As the Makefiles now stand, all export-objs (OX_OBJS) get linked
before non-export-objs (O_OBJS) in the same directory, independantly
of any ordering imposed within the Makefile.
This caused md.o to get linked before raid?.o.
Due to carelessness on my part I didn't notice this happening when I
was testing.
The following patch fixes it.  I hope the change to Rules.make is
acceptable - I have CCed to linux-kbuild incase anyone there has an
issue with it.
Even allowing for that though, some of the boot-time messages look
very strange.  Friedrich: could you let me know how the various
partitions were expected to be combined into raid arrays - from the
boot log, it looks like there are three single drive raid1 arrays, and
that doesn't seem to make much sense.
