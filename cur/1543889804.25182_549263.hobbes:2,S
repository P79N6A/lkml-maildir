Hmm...
I find in section 6.1:

Which suggests that INTx support is required.
I do not find any wording that suggest the opposite.
I do see it stated that it is intended to EOL support for INTx at
some point.
Where did you see it mentioned that INTx was optional?
I do see it clearly stating that MSI is the preferred mechanism from
pci express.
