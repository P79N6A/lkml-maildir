Ken,
	AFAICS, some hdparm -t or dbench 1 will reveal slight variations
between 2.4 & 2.6 ... In some cases 2.4 will be better.
	Running dbench 10 we have :
2.6
202 48.57
234 22.28
234 16.00
234 12.48
234 10.23
234 8.66
234 7.52
431 12.37
463 11.86
464 10.76
2.4.21
119 15.06
151 10.75
282 15.54
301 13.44
313 11.84
352 11.49
360 10.38
360 9.29
360 8.42
	Here's what we can call a server direction.2.6 is unbeatable there due
to IO scheduler (i.e. As-iosched, cfq and noop rock'n'roll)
	There are no good conclusions at all although ,at this state of
development, IMHO, 2.4 seems more 'client friendly' and 2.6 server
oriented in this chapter.

FabF
