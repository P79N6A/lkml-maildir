0 is EOF _for_reads_. For writes it is not very well defined (except for
the special case of a zero-sized write to a regular file).
For writes, 0 has historically been what Linux has returned for various
"disk full" conditions, and seems to be what programs such a "tar"
actually expected for end of disk.  Also, traditionally a lot of UNIXes
returned 0 when O_NDELAY was set and they couldn't write anything (ie
the modern EAGAIN). 
An application seeing a zero return from a write with a non-zero buffer
size cannot really assume much about what it means. The best you can
probably do is to fall back and say "no more space on device", but
obviously a lot of programmers who are used to testing only for _real_
errors will not even think about considering 0 an error value.
So returning 0 for write() is usually a bad idea - exactly because it
does not have very well-defined semantics.  So -EFBIG is certainly the
preferable return value, and seems to be what SuS wants, too.
