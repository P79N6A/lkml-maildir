I think what you're saying is that they'd both return positive, right?
Unfortunately I think lots of code in userspace assumes files / directories
are mutually exclusive conditions, and acts accordingly ... eg:
if [ -f file ]
	do file stuff
else
	do directory stuff
fi.
Now I'm not saying they're not broken ... but seems like a dangerous thing 
to change in the midst of a stable kernel series.
