Not completely. One reason wht the sample rate of 200 probably fixed the
problem is that you have very high acceleration settings in X.
Since with report rate 200 you get a medium speed movement as
+1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1
events, and with report rate 60 you get
       +3      +3       +3
and the X mouse acceleration code is stupid enough to judge the mouse
speed from the event VALUE only, it thinks the mouse is moving much
faster in the second case.
You need to up the acceleration threshold (or disable acceleration
completely).
This also means that with report rate of 200, mouse acceleration is more
or less disabled, since you get +1's only even at quite high speeds of
mouse movement.

I don't want to. I like the feel of a mouse at 200 samples per second,
however it causes problems on some hardware, which means I have to stay
with a more reasonable default.

It already is. Only the code to make it a kernel command line parameter
(when psmouse is compiled into the kernel) is missing.

Yes, new boards don't have any problems with it. It's the older ones
that do.
