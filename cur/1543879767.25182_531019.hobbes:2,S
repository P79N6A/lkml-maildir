Hmm, it looks like i8042 is the last thing on the dpm_off_irq list.  Still,
if the ACPI resume fails, the next messages may not make it to the console
(it's not very probable, though).
I've tried to reproduce your problem on another box on which I have no PS/2
keyboard (USB keyboard/mouse only) and the USB legacy support set, but I can't.
There must be something very special in your configuration.
Have you tried the patch that I posted some time ago (appended again for
convenience)?
