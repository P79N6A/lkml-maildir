2.4.19 appears to have that patch already applied except for changing the 
QLOGICFC_REQ_QUEUE_LEN to 255 in qlogicfc.h.  I made that change and 
rebooted with the new kernel. And I still have the same problem. I did 
however make sure none of the other hosts had the raid device started, and 
it still does the same thing, which pushes my suspicion back onto the 
drivers.
