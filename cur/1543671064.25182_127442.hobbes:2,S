Hi all,
I reply to myself, after having test this solution.

The 2.4.20-ac2 patched kernel help a little : the system don't crash
anymore. But the disk is marked as defective, and is removed from the
raid1 metadevice.
One other problem with the -ac2 is the speed for the rebuild : it seems
to be 2 times slower than with the Ducan patch. (about 2 hours instead
of 1 hour).
So, my solution is to use the patch from Ducan. I hope it (or a
derivative form of it) will be included in the next kernel releases.
Good day, and thanks all for the help.
		Olivier
