This would indeed be the case for ext3 filesystems updated to ext4.
They will only be able to store the low 32 bits of the version, which
is itself normally enough for NFSv4 because it only uses the inequality
check.  Having the full 64 bits available eliminates the risk of
collisions, and given that the spec mandates a 64-bit version I'm sure
someone will take full advantage of it in NFS at some point.
Cheers, Andreas
