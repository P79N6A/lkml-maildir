There is/was at least one simulator that shoots the kernel (and
everything else) dead in response to frobbing the PIC while the local
APIC timer etc. are going, and I wouldn't be surprised if there were
some real hardware that did so as well.
(this is the code under if (timer_ack) in do_timer_interrupt())
