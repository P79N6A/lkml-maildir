I've always felt that it is wrong (or at least misleading) that WARN_ON
prints "BUG".  It would have been better if it had said "WARNING", and only
BUG_ON says "BUG".
But lots of people have now written downstream log-parsing tools which
might break due to this change, so I'm inclined to go with Ingo's patch,
and restore the old (il)logic.
