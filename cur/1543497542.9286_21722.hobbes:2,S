     It depends.
     I've got a little Sony VAIO 505fx that will boot off a pcmcia
     IDE cdrom.
     I've got more laptops that won't boot off a pcmcia IDE cdrom, but
     which would really like to be able to talk to that pcmcia IDE cdrom
     without fuss, muss, or bother so they could then use the Mastodon
     cd that's sitting forlornly in the CD-ROM to put Linux on the
     machine. (Currently I pry apart the laptop, put the IDE disk into a
     desktop machine, install Mastodon there <and once the PCMCIA tools
     are installed, they work pretty much flawlessly, modulo their
     weakness for using IRQs that are assigned to other hardware>, then
     put the disk back into the laptop.
