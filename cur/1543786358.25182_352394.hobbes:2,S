Christoph will know the issue better than I.  But I'd say no, that's
not OK.  You have some out of tree "enhanced system accounting" which
has been granted the privilege of hooks within the mainline kernel:
they should be disabled unless a CONFIG option is switched on, which
your accounting patch can do.  And the (mainline) Kconfig help entry
for that CONFIG option should point us to the source of your package.
