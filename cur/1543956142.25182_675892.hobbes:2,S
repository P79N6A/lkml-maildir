That really was just an example, we have per-wireless-device debugfs
code users can easily trigger a debugfs_remove() by unplugging a usb
netdevice for example. Also, that means that anything that is dynamic
would have the lifetime rules imposed by debugfs which is rather
awkward.
The current code for simple_attr_open copies the in i_private pointer:
attr->data = inode->i_private;
if, instead, it would keep a reference to that, like
attr->dataptr = &﻿inode->i_private;
we could NULL out that pointer on debugfs_remove() and have
simple_attr_read() just return -ENOENT.
However, if nobody else is concerned about this, I'll just remove all
the wireless debugfs code instead, I just don't want to allow crashing
it that way.
