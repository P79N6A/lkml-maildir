I guess that you are talking about the fact that displaying text 
messages would be possible only after the first device driver has 
initialized and registered with the kernel.
You could do the printing in two stages: at the begining the same way as 
in the current kernel, but as soon as the first driver is registered, 
the kernel switches to the function provided by the driver.
Something like this:
void print_message(...)
{
    if (no_module_registered) {
       use_print_function_provided_by_the_kernel();
    } else {
       if (!printing_disabled) {
          use_print_function_provided_by_the_driver_module();
       } else {
          /* printing disabled by the userspace, we are not
           * allowed to touch the hardware */
       }
    }
}
