Hello,
	This kj patch series does kmalloc + memset conversion to k[cz]alloc. Some
of them also remove redundant argument checks to functions that already do that
internally. Also some minor style things are fixed like redundant k[mcz]alloc casts.
Most of this patches shrink object size by several hundred bytes (you'll find stats
below signed-off line) so this is a good thing. Almost all of them were compile tested.
Please review and apply.
Regards,
	Mariusz
