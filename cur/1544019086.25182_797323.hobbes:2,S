That patch is not acceptable - it is ugly and it adds another set of
#ifdefs to an already complex piece of code.
As i explained it to James in recent threads, the clean and acceptable 
solution to this class of problems is to switch Voyager away from that 
fragile subarch code to proper generic x86 code. (just like we did it for 
other subarchitectures)
There is nothing in Voyager that justifies special treatment in the area 
of x86 percpu code.
This is one of the mails that explains the principles:

Or - if there's no time/interest in doing that, we can mark Voyager as 
CONFIG_BROKEN.
