I believe the worst thing about dnotify is the "umount blocking"
behaviour. It drives me crazy since i use the Linux desktop. So if this
is the "Year of the linux desktop", please please switch OFF dnotify
until it does not open files for monitoring anymore! Or until "inotify"
works.
Btw, i have written a little tool to assist people with the
umount-problem and collected some links

I don't understand, why the author of inotify wants to force people to
use user-space daemons like fam (which requires xinetd, ...)? Does using
a daemon for multiplexing really add efficiency? Is it really worth
adding all the complexity of things like "fam" to the system, just
because more than one application monitor the same directory once in a
while? I doubt it.
I would even claim, that simple polling ("stat"-ing) the filesystem for
changes is more efficient in 95% of the cases, than all this dnotify,
fam, etc... stuff.
Just to be fair - i don't think that dnotify or fam are bad tools, but
the combination of them seems poisonous for the desktop.
