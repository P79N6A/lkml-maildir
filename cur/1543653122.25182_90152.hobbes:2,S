I've already conceded this to Jeff Garzik, but...

In theory.  In practice our current build process in mm/ is not
compiled as a module.  eg: if we put in mm/readahead.c 
	module_param(debug, int, 0600);
It'd be called "readahead.debug" not "mm.debug".  Maybe that's fine,
but indicates the subtle difference.

Sure.  MODULE_AUTHOR(), MODULE_DESCRIPTION(), MODULE_PARM_DESC() and
MODULE_LICENSE() fight the other way.  They were previously module
only, but that's an implmentation detail: plan is to expose the first
three at least through sysfs, or just leave them as stubs for
documentation purposes.
Am off to visit Extremadura to see the LinEx project: will update
patch and re-send within 24 hrs,
Rusty.
