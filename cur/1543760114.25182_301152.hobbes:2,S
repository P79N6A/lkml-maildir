Would it be that hard to have scripts on kernel.org generate the diff 
against 2.6.11 when Greg puts up the 2.6.11.3 diff against 2.6.22.2, then 
have the front page have two links, one for patch against 2.6.11 and one 
for patch against previous 2.6.11.z ?  That along with the full source 
(which I see is up there already) should make everyone happy, and if it is 
automated the burden on Greg should be minimal.
