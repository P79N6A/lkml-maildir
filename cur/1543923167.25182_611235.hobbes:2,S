Subject: [PATCH] Only show RESOURCES_64BIT on relevant architectures
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

To quote lolcats: CONFIG_RESOURCES_64BIT DO NOT WANT!
I *think* I have the logic of this right... Anyway, I was annoyed by
having to do the bloody ugly casts to unsigned long long in
arch-specific code. As near as I can tell, we only want this selectable
in the case of PAE on x86, and some random PPC and MIPS embedded boards.
For everyone else, it should be whatever the value of 64BIT is.
And I can be happy and continue using unsigned long and going about my
merry business.
