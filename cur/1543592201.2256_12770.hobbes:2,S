It's the principle of a kernel-linked boot image, not initrd, which is
important.  Unpacking a cramfs image from an __init section is much
cleaner than initrd and has almost the same effect: the boot
filesystem just ends up readonly that way.  Either way we can hook
in that default user-space code at boot time transparently.
