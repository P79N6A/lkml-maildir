Much better, but still not perfect.
Now it writes out 1024 pages after 30 seconds and then the rest after
another 30s.
If my analysis is correct, this is because when it first gets onto
s_io other inodes will get there too (with up-to 30s later dirying
time), and the contents of s_more_io won't be recycled until the
current contents of s_io are processed.
Maybe this is OK, the previous weird stuff didn't seem to bother a lot
of people either.
