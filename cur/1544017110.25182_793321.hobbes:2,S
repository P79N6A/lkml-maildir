I don't have the exact config for the previous tests but it's was just
my laptop regular config whereas the new tests are x86-64 defconfig.
So I think I'm just hitting some of the other OLTP regressions here,
aren't I? There's some scheduler related options such as
CONFIG_GROUP_SCHED and CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED enabled in defconfig
that I didn't have in the original tests. I can try without them if
you want but I'm not sure it's relevant for SLAB vs SLUB tests.
