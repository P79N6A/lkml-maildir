*shrug*  Your "all they have to do" is quite heavy.

I've had a very dubious pleasure of dealing with our boot sequence lately.
Adding more cruft to it (including in-kernel linker, for fsck sake) is
_not_ a good idea.
Folks, whatever had happened with "if it can be done in userland - don't
put it into the kernel"?
That goes for a _lot_ of code.  Mounting root.  Detecting the type of
initrd contents.  Loading ramdisk from floppies.  Asking to press
key (you really ought to look what is done for _that_).  Speaking
DHCP - we have a kernel DHCP client, of all things.  All that stuff
can (and should) be done from userland process.  And there's much
more of the same kind.
There is a word for that and that word is "crap".
Let loader leave an archive to be unpacked into rootfs?  Sure.  Let kernel
exec /init on rootfs and leave the rest to it?  Absolutely.  But let's
stop adding userland stuff into the kernel.  Loading modules _can_ be
done from userland - insmod does it just fine.  And that's where it should
be done.
