No, not drunk, just that no other arch offered up any potential help to
get this working.  So, we have one arch that has it working well, and
finally, many years later when PPC64 catches up with the rest of the
world, we have issues :)
Feel free to help untangle it.  ia64 just did a big chunk of work on
this, and there are further patches in the -mm tree that help get it
working there.  ppc64 and other arch support are also welcome.  You are
the ones who know how your arch handles this stuff the best.

2 week merge window?  Come on, just give it to me and let it sit in -mm
for a while.  I have some stuff in there for over 2 months before it
goes to Linus to make sure that it's safe.  You can do the same for your
trees.
I gladly accept patches...
thanks,
