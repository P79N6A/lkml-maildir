This is the common "peacemaking" wisdom, but I think, in fact, there
are valid technical arguments for both views (my own techical
assessment: littleendian is technically superior, but bigendian is
used on the 'net.  Some humans find littleendian confusing because
most modern human writing systems write numbers in bigendian form.)
You sometimes find that drivers written on littleendian systems don't
work on bigendian systems without porting, since there are some
shortcuts that littleendian representation allows which are invalid on
bigendian.
