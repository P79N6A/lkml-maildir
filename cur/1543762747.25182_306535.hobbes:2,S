I'm running 2.6.11 with Ingo's Preempt patch 
(realtime-preempt-2.6.11-final-V0.7.40-04).  The system is SMP with a 
broadcom NIC (tg3 driver).  I am seeing truly appalling network performance 
(2-4kbps on a 1gbps network).  Is this a known issue?  I know this patch is 
not production ready, what traces/logs do you need/want to be able to 
debug/fix this?
Thanks,
Tom
