Hi all,
There is a clean patch for 2.4.20 (taken from Alans original patch) at
http://www.hardrock.org/kernel/2.4.20/linux-2.4.20-ptrace.patch
I am currently using it on 3 production systems at work and
it seems stable. You will notice processes which are not dumpable with
this patch, as the output from ps ax will contain the process name in []
square brackets.
Regards
James Bourne
