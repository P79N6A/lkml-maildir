Subject: [patch] 2.3.50 and EXPORT_SYMTAB
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I could compile 2.3.49 fine, but the 2.3.50 with pretty much same config
will bail out while trying compile some modules complainining that 
EXPORT_SYMTAB is not defined.
I could compile given modules without any problems by just using same
comand line arguments and adding -DEXPORT_SYMTAB to command line.
To fix this, the following "patch" from linux/drivers/sound/Makefile needs
to be backed out
	-MI_OBJS                := $(sort $(filter-out $(export-objs), $(int-m)))
	-MIX_OBJS       := $(sort $(filter     $(export-objs), $(int-m)))
	+#MI_OBJS               := $(sort $(filter-out $(export-objs), $(int-m)))
	+#MIX_OBJS      := $(sort $(filter     $(export-objs), $(int-m)))
Once that's done, the following patch should be removed as well from
file drviers/sound/sb_common.c
	+
	+/* FIXME: *grr* why can't the f**in Makefile do this for me ? */
	+#define EXPORT_SYMTAB
	+
The problem is that if the first patch is aplied the stuff are not treated
any longer as module (as I understand this) and thus EXPORT_SYMTAB is 
getting not defined when trying to comile stuff as modules.
Once those fixes are applied the kernel will compile fine for me.
Here follow some examples before the fixes:
Here's a sample file which compiles correctly:
make[4]: Entering directory
`/usr/src/Linux/23/linux/drivers/char/ftape/zftape'
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/Linux/23/linux/include -D__SMP__ -Wall
	-Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe   -DCPU=686 -march=i686
	-fno-strict-aliasing -DMODULE -DMODVERSIONS -include
	/usr/src/Linux/23/linux/include/linux/modversions.h -DZFT_OBSOLETE
	-DEXPORT_SYMTAB -c zftape_syms.c
Here follow sample bailout:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/Linux/23/linux/include -D__SMP__ -Wall
	-Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe   -DCPU=686 -march=i686

sound_syms.c:17: parse error before `EXPORT_SYMTAB_not_defined'
sound_syms.c:17: warning: type defaults to `int' in declaration of
`EXPORT_SYMTAB_not_ defined'
[and so on...]
