So what you're saying is that it's down to me to test the thing.
Ok.
I've been extremely patient waiting for e100 to get fixed (it's been
literally _years_), and I think it isn't surprising that the hardware
it was noticed on has been packed away.
Now I ask the same of others for when I'm (a) well enough to enter
the cold environment in which this machine is currently stored and
(b) can find the time to resurect the machine.
