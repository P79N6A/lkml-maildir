Yes! Entirely! The BIG advantage of the NDIS-6 driver is
the established interface makes it possible to readily
reverse-engineer it, i.e., find out how it works. Many
of the network drivers use the same hardware core (ne).
It's the extra stuff like the transciever interface that
the NDIS drivers will expose.
