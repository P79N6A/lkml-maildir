It's impossible to rename a file on a VFAT filesystem if
the only difference between the old and new names is case
(eg. longfilename and LongFilename).  The operation is
cancelled in fs/namei.c because the lookups return the
same dentry for both names.  What would be the most
reasonable way to fix this?
