Hi all,
Is ingress policing not working in the current Kernel?
I'm using the Script from the Advanced Routing HOWTO
(Thanks for that BTW!)
While trying to do a
# tc qdisc add dev ppp0 handle ffff: ingress
I get this:
RTNETLINK answers: No such file or directory
Before that I successfully did this:
# install root CBQ
DEV=ppp0
UPLINK=100
DOWNLINK=750
tc qdisc add dev $DEV root handle 1: cbq avpkt 1000 bandwidth 100mbit
tc class add dev $DEV parent 1: classid 1:1 cbq rate ${UPLINK}kbit \
allot 1500 prio 5 bounded isolated
tc class add dev $DEV parent 1:1 classid 1:10 cbq rate ${UPLINK}kbit \
   allot 1600 prio 1 avpkt 1000
tc class add dev $DEV parent 1:1 classid 1:20 cbq rate $[9*$UPLINK/10]kbit \
   allot 1600 prio 2 avpkt 1000
tc qdisc add dev $DEV parent 1:10 handle 10: sfq perturb 10
tc qdisc add dev $DEV parent 1:20 handle 20: sfq perturb 10
tc filter add dev $DEV parent 1:0 protocol ip prio 10 u32 \
      match ip tos 0x10 0xff  flowid 1:10
tc filter add dev $DEV parent 1:0 protocol ip prio 11 u32 \
        match ip protocol 1 0xff flowid 1:10
tc filter add dev $DEV parent 1: protocol ip prio 12 u32 \
   match ip protocol 6 0xff \
   match u8 0x05 0x0f at 0 \
   match u16 0x0000 0xffc0 at 2 \
   match u8 0x10 0xff at 33 \
   flowid 1:10
tc filter add dev $DEV parent 1: protocol ip prio 13 u32 \
   match ip dst 0.0.0.0/0 flowid 1:20
I have crawled the archives and found some mails describing this
problem but I did not find any solution. Some of the mails were
from year 2000...
So does anybody know a solution for that Problem?
I'm using Kernel 2.4.17 with everything <M>'ed or [*]'ed in
QoS-Setup.
The Docu says something about the module would be called cls_ingress.o 
but there is only sch_ingress.o. Is this a Docu-Bug BTW?
All sch_* modules seem to load perfectly.
regards
