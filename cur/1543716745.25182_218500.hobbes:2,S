We already tested former versions of this patch with great success. We 
saved about 50 MB of memory on our typical S390 scenario -per LPAR. As 
there are 30 possible LPAR that can share all SAN/network devices we save 
about 30*50=1500MB of unswappable dentry/inode cache memory. Therefore 
other architectures with partitions should test this patch as well. It 
would also be nice to have some experience on x86. 
I consider this patch almost a must for s390/zSeries if there is SANs with 
shared DASDs. I made a short acceptance test of this version - more stress 
will follow. If I encounter problems I will report these to Maneesh to 
solve these problems.
cheers
