Christoph stop being ridiculous. Its one thing to object to kernel
markers and some of the rather nice tools they give you for
borderline technical reasons, but at the point you start saying "remove
references to" you are just trying to censor stuff you don't personally
approve of and you sound as stupid as RMS in his "don't link to non GPL
material" mode.
The kernel documentation is *FULL* of references to out of tree code and
documents precisely because the kernel does not exist in isolation.
