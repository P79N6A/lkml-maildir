I wasn't the actual contributor, but did help with some of the testing.
We will do some testing on the updates your currently making. At first
glance they look very sensible.
We certainly appreciate your work developing forcedeth and will help
maintain forcedeth in the future. Maybe you will be able to remove the
"not endorsed by NVIDIA" in the header. :)
