If that is the case, can't you do it without introducing this
new tag object, like this?
  1. Find existing commit-id that you want to tag.
  2. Sign that commit object:
     cat-file commit $commit |
     gpg --detach-sign --armor -u 'Linus Torvalds' >commit.sig
  3. Make another commit, making the original commit as its parent:
     {
         echo tag This is my tag.
         cat commit.sig 
     } | commit-tree $(cat-file commit $commit |
                       sed -e 's/tree //;d') -p $commit
Then you can publish the ID of this commit object, which attests
that the original commit is what you vouch for.  Am I missing
something?
