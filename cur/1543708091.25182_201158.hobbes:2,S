Actually, I read you a bit fast. I think our driver only supports 24C02
and 24C04, because 24C08 and bigger require 2-byte addressing.

I didn't know about that. Funnily enough, a user reported today about a
strange EEPROM on his I2C bus, and it turns out that it holds a MAC
address (or at least it really looks like that).

The driver wasn't part of Linux 2.4 itself, because the lm_sensors
drivers were never integrated there. But they are in 2.6.

Aha, I read a bit too fast here too :/ We support the MAX1617(A), not
the MAX1619. That said, I took a look at the datasheet and the chips are
said to be very similar, so extending the driver should be quite
straightforward.
Anyway, the point isn't wether the exact drivers already exist or not.
The point is that using the existing i2c subsystem means that other
people needing support for similar chips will be able to use the same
drivers as you. This also means that all existing user-space tools will
work out-of-the-box, which is a great benefit IMHO.
