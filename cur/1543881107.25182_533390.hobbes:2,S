If we ever add an implementation for s390 we can rmeove the depends line
again. The current situation is that we don't support it.

We don't have support and it is VERY unlikely we will get it. I would
prefer to hide the menu.

Without a driver is it mute to have the menu.

This is a border-case. Someone might add a driver that actually works.
Currently it is an empty menu.

If we ever come up with an implementation for RTC we can remove the
depends statement again. Until we do it is another empty menu.
Thanks Arnd for the review.
