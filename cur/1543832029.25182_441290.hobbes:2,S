I sat down to do this and realized it was a lame idea. If a given
platform cannot tolerate PCI I/O while a PCI channel is hung, then
the plaform should stub out readb()/read()/pci_read_config_word()/etc.
as needed to prevent I/O during the critical stage.
Otherwise, one is trying to chase down all the locations in the driver
that may or may not require I/O to be disabled, which is a hit-or-miss,
mistake-prone operation.
