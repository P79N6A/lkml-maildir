   Please note that the knfsd server has consistently violated this
   part of the NFSv2 protocol: knfsd acknowledges a write statement
   from the client without ensuring that data has been flushed to
   disk, thus the client is not guaranteed that anything it has
   written will survive a server failure.
Come again?  I see a nfsd_sync and a write_inode_now there in
the knfsd write paths.
Later,
