Subject: [GFS2 & DLM] Proposed patches for 2.6.20 merge window [0/54]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
Following this message are the patches which currently make up the GFS2
-nmw (next merge window) git tree. Mostly they are bug fixes and clean
ups, but there are one or two other changes, the highlights being:
 [26/54] Changes "writeback" mounts to not require buffer heads in
writepages and also results in fewer I/Os.
 [29/54] This is probably the most notable since it effectively shrinks
the amount of memory per struct gfs2_inode by half.
 [27/54] Removes the attempt at directory readahead in readdir and
results in a substantial speed improvement for readdir without noticably
slowing readdir+stat performance.
Steve.
