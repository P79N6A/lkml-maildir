Subject: Patch for 2.3.18 to ignore bogus APM error codes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I have an aging ThinkPad 755C, which has a broken APM BIOS.  When it
blanks or unblanks the screen, the message "unknown error code 0x53"
is reported.
To work around the fact that the APM BIOS reported an error, but the
operation works, the contents of eax (which is supposed to hold the error
code) is compared with the supplied value of eax.  If they are identical,
then the error indication is ignored.
I have only added the behaviour to apm_bios_call_simple, as in my case,
it is only set_power_state calls that are affected.
The patch adds a new config option CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_BOGUS_ERROR to enable
this behaviour, to ensure that it doesn't impact anyone but those that
need it.
