I have bad news for you. The kernel doesn't even maintain
the decaying average. Per-process %cpu on Linux is a lie,
and always has been -- except with "top", which crudely does
a measurement itself.
What you get for %cpu is calculated over the lifetime of
the process. Maybe you can find a scheduler hacker to fix
this problem. I'll Cc: a few for you.
Guys, this is a POSIX and UNIX requirement. The system is
supposed to report per-process %CPU for a "recent" time frame.
