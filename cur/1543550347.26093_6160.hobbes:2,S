That's up to the filesystems ;)
If the VM does a page->mapping->flush() callback and the
filesystem flushes (on average) 20 pages as a result of
such a callback, we'll only have to do the callback for
5% of the pages ...
Also, by speeding up / slowing down bdflush (kflushd) as
appropriate, you can avoid having to do the flush callback
at all most of the time.  (for "normal" access patterns
and under "normal" loads)
The ->flush() callback is mostly there for those situations
in which we have a big discrepancy between the filesystem
writeout order and the VM page reclaim order...
regards,
Rik
