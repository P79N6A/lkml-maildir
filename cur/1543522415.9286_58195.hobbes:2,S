It is possible, but highly unlikely, that the UART has been left in
a strange loop-back mode. In particular, the DLAB (Divisor latch access
bit) ONLY must be set when the baud-rate divisor is set (on some UARTs),
or the UART will be left in a strange state once DLAB is reset.
Maybe Theodore Ts'o could check. I see in the code where UART_LCR_DLAB
is ORed with 'cval'. This could cause a problem.
