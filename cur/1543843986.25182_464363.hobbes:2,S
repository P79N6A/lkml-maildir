When I see an analysis of every line of source code on an average Linux 
machine then I might believe you (if you'll grant that no software can 
ever be installed on it afterward without being analyzed) but until then 
I'll stick with a centralized policy. I doubt many others will be 
satisfied with that limitation.
Bracketing hardly makes it analyzable, how can you possibly know if the 
bracketing happened? You *believe* it will and therefore you say that 
the bracketed code is safe but in reality this is a discretionary 
mechanism and you have zero assurance that there is any security 
whatsoever, no thanks, I'll pass.
