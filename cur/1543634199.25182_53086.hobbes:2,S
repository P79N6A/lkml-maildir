Yes, but they are not unneeded files, otherwise we wouldn't even try to 
build them. The point is, the semantics of bzImage changed: It now means 
"build bzImage and modules". That's the common case. If you really only 
want bzImage and no modules, you have to tell make by using
"make KBUILD_MODULES= bzImage" (I could allow for phrasing the latter as
"make bzImage nomodules", but that's only cosmetical)

IMO these options (all yes/mod)  are there to find files which don't
compile, be it for an explicit #error or other reasons - and they serve
this purpose, they now flag those files already at "make dep" time if
you're using modversions.
Of course I could go ahead if I get an error during module version
generation, but then I'd get the exact same error later when compiling. So
I don't see the point. Module versions used to be fragile, exactly for
reasons like this. If this step goes wrong, just silently ignoring that
fact will get you in trouble later.

Well, normally people carry their .config along and adapt it as necessary. 
If a driver stopped building, if you don't need it, disable it in your 
.config, if you need it, just ignoring the failure won't help you either. 
Apart from that, "make modules_install" never worked in the case of 
failed builds, did it? - so it boils down to: you need a buildable .config 
to build and test a kernel.

Okay, I fixed that here.

Actually, I tried and don't see this happening.
