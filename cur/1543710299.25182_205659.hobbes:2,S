The whole /proc/ipw2100/xxx interface is ugly and a mess.  It doesn't expose anything
really useful that can't be found other ways and it is buggy.  It doesn't handle
more than one device;  I know you don't make hardware with multiple chipsets now but
will that always be true?  Also, it forgets to do properly set module owner. 
If you really have to keep the interface could you consider putting it in sysfs.
Something like /sys/class/net/eth0/ipw2100/xxx with one value per file.
The way to do that is with attribute groups.
The following wrappers might help:
