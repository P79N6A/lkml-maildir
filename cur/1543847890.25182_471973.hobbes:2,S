ok, so a patch to simplify *all* of the above implementations of
sema_init() to a single call to __SEMAPHORE_INITIALIZER() would not be
out of line.  i'll resubmit my earlier one, making sure it's based on
the latest "git pull".

well, ok, i worded that badly.  let me try again.  at least the
semaphore *interfaces* across all architectures seem to be almost
identical, with the exception, of course, of the inline "asm"
routines.  but (and i know this idea is not going *anywhere*) when a
routine in a header file is defined as inline and consists of a dozen
assembler statements, wouldn't it make more sense to (dons asbestos
suit here) have those routines be part of the *source* file and not
the header file?
i'm probably making more of this than it's worth but, as i was digging
around in the semaphore implementations, it struck me that there was a
lot of unnecessary duplication across the numerous semaphore.h files.
is there no reasonable way to get rid of at least *some* of that?

so perhaps the up and down functions represent the stuff that can be
kept in arch-specific files, while the rest of semaphore.h is
condensed to a single, cross-arch file.  it still seems like there's
lots of redundancy that can be eliminated here with very little
effort.
