Tejun, since Jeff is apparently traveling this week, and Gregor tested the 
patch successfully (and it looks sane anyway - why in Gods name _would_ we 
care what the initial setting of nsect/lbal is?), can you send this in 
with the changelog and sign-off?
Maybe it can go through Andrew like the other patch (the sata_promise 
irq/polling handling), but I can take it directly too. Whatever seems 
best.
