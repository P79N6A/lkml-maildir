I found out that the current Linux client of lockd blocks non-blocking lock
requests while the server is in the grace period.
I think this is incorrect behavior and I am wondering if the will exists
out there to correct this and return "resource not available"
to the process when a request is for a *non-blocking* lock while the server
is in the grace period.
It is extremelly odd to issue a *non-blocking* call and be blocked in the
kernel for about a minute when the server happens
to be in the grace period.
This consists of a minor change to nlmclnt_call() and I would send the
patch if someone will review and include it.
Regards, Juan
