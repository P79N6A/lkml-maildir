So, something like this?

reiserfs: trylock i_mutex in file release when packing
The mmap_sem is nested under the i_mutex.  reiserfs_file_release() wants
to acquire the i_mutex to pack the file but it can be called with the mmap_sem
held by munmap.  This has produced lockdep warnings in testing.
  
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/19/73
This acquires the i_mutex in reiserfs_file_release() with a trylock.  If the
i_mutex is already held it simply won't pack.  There are already a host of
conditions under which it won't pack.
Totally untested, but built.
