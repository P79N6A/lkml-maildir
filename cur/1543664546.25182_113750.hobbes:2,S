Precedence: bulk

My corrections file is up at 
http://www.kegel.com/spell-fix-dan1.txt
and the patch that produces is
http://www.kegel.com/linux-2.5.63-bk5-spell.patch.bz2.bin
The perl script took about an hour of 450MHz cpu time.
(Might be worth adding a quick path to detect and skip
files with none of the misspelled words.  Or just run
on a fast machine...)
I did a spot check, and it looked pretty good, but some
of the fixes are just too pedantic.  In particular,
   decrementor=decrementer
should probably be dropped from the fix list.
Any other changes people want to see in the script
or the corrections file?   Should I add fixes for
uncommon errors (those that happen only in one or two files)?
- Dan
