Checking the last character is not that big win. For 8-byte names the very
first access will suck both into the cache. Ditto for your variant. I'm
not sure that cost of taken branch will not outweight the benefit from
doing less comaprisons. Actually memcmp is overkill here - we don't care
*who* is greater, just whether they are different or not.
