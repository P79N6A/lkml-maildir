No, technically Red Hat really *does* have copyrights of their own.
Red Hat owns the "compilation copyright" on their distribution. That 
means, for example, that even if they have _only_ open source programs on 
their DVD image, you still are not necessarily able (without their 
permission) to set up a "cheap-cd's" kind of operation, and sell their 
CD-ROM/DVD images for a lower price.
So yes, they do own the Red Hat trademark too, but they fundamentally do 
own copyrights over and beyond those of the individual programs they 
distribute!
Now, I think it so happens that the RHEL DVD's contains other programs 
than just open source, and that you couldn't legally copy them *anyway*, 
but that's a different issue.
Also, happily, a lot of vendors do not *want* to exercise their 
copyright in the compilation, so you can go to cheapbytes.com, and you'll 
find Fedora CD's, OpenSuSE CD's, Ubuntu CD's, etc, and as far as I know, 
they're all perfectly legal. Exactly because open-source vendors usually 
don't want to look nasty by limiting the compilation, when they can't 
really limit the individual parts anyway.

I'd not put contract there, but fair enough. But what I was really trying 
to point out is that there are many different "levels" of copyright.
So you can own a "copyright in the compilation" - which just means that 
you own the details of how you set it all together - _without_ actually 
necessarily owning the copyrights in any of the individual packages 
(although you obviously have to have a license to _make_ a compilation of 
them - but the GPLv2 is one such license).
