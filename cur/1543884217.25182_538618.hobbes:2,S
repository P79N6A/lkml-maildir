That doesn't seem like a terrible solution to me, unless you expect
the class limit to be changing incredibly frequently.
If we had multiple subsystems that needed to walk the container member
list on a fast-path operation (e.g. to make a scheduling decision)
that would be a good reason to maintain such a list.

Sounds like a good idea if you can do it - but if it's per-process,
how would it fit in the class structure?
