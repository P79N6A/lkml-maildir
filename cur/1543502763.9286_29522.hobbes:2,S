I've checked that the problems are continuous (both ultrapenguin and
rh60), even with latest kernels and not using external drives attached to
the NCR bus but to an qolgic isp card.
So I've stoppped using the Sparc machines until I'm sure they are
reliable. I keep them ready to test new patches if available and I'm
willing to help.
Thanks for everybody's help and involvement. I've been surprised that the
Sun support people got involved in the discussion with Gerard trying to
make clear how the drivers should work.
