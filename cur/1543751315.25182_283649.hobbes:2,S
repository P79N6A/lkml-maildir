Hi Jan,
-> default gateway is set to 10.0.22.1, on eth0.
-> 
-> Problem is, if I try to ping from another network 
-> (10.216.0.xx) to 10.0.24.xx, i see the following ARP request:
-> 
-> arp who-has 10.0.22.1 tell 10.0.24.xx
->
You see that coming out the eth0 interface??  
If that is the case it is most definately wrong.  Assuming that your
masks are setup properly.  But I haven't worked on the 2.4 kernel for a
long time so I'm not so sure if what you are seeing is a bug that has
been fixed.
