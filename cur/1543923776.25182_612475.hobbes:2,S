It seems if you break the comparison out into a function which
takes a u32, that's enough to get rid of the warning.
I can't figure out a way to make this prettier, can you?
#define PAGE_SIZE	(64 * 1024)
typedef unsigned int u32;
typedef unsigned short u16;
int compare(u32 val)
{
	if (val >= PAGE_SIZE)
		return -1;
	return 0;
}
int foo(u16 val)
{
#if 1
	return compare(val);
#else
	if (val >= PAGE_SIZE)
		return -1;
	return 0;
#endif
}
