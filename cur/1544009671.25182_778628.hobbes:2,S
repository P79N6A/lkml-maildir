Note that ext2, for example, also only writes the string bytes without
any NULLs. It only happen to be zero padded because any last-page is zero-padded
from i_size to end of page.

The inode's i_size already holds the string count so at the higher level
we have that information. But I'm convinced, nd_set_link() should receive
a new max_len, all users should be changed as a matter of code audit.
nd_set_link() should then proceed to truncate the string at that length
unconditionally no need for error returns.
