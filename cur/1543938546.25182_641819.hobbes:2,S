The cable already has been replaced three times. I even got sure to 
*not* bend the cable. This all doesn't help.
May a bad cable really cause corrupted data?
I also have such messages for my cdrom drive (the bad sector messages at 
the end of the log for drive hdc). I replaced the 40 pin cable with a 
new 80 pin one and still have the errors...
