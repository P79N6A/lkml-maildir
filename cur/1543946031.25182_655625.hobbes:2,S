Sure, performance is very important, and it's good to see that you're
critical about the changes I'm proposing. That said, the memory layout
doesn't change at all with this patch -- the fields that didn't go into
the generic dma descriptor were at the end of the struct to begin with.
I can add a comment saying that cookie and ack must always come first.
Any other fields that we need to be careful about?
