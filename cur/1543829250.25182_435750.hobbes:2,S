Hi,
Currently, if i mmap() a file PROT_WRITE only and then first read from it 
and then write to it, i get a SEGV. However, if i write to it first and 
then read from it, i get no SEGV. This seems rather inconsistent.
The current implementation seems to be to make PROT_WRITE imply PROT_READ, 
however it does not quite work correctly. The patch below resolves this 
issue, by explicitly setting the PROT_READ flag when PROT_WRITE is 
requested.
This might appear at first as a possible permissions subversion, as i 
could get PROT_READ on a file that i only have write permission 
to...however, the mmap implementation requires that the file be opened 
with at least read access already. Thus, i don't believe there is any 
issue with regards to permissions.
Another consequenece of this patch is that it forces PROT_READ even for 
architectures that might be able to support it, (I know that x86, x86_64 
and ia64 do not) but i think this is best for portability.
This was originally reported by Doug Chapman.
thanks,
-Jason
