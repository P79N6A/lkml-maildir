Since pps_unregister_source() is defined as:
void pps_unregister_source(int source)
{
        struct pps_device *pps;
        spin_lock_irq(&idr_lock);
        pps = idr_find(&pps_idr, source);
        if (!pps) {
                spin_unlock_irq(&idr_lock);
                return;
        }
        /* This should be done first in order to deny IRQ handlers
         * to access PPS structs
         */
        idr_remove(&pps_idr, pps->id);
        spin_unlock_irq(&idr_lock);
        wait_event(pps->usage_queue, atomic_read(&pps->usage) == 0);
        pps_sysfs_remove_source_entry(pps);
        pps_unregister_cdev(pps);
        kfree(pps);
}
changing pps_cdev_open() as follow should resolve this problem:
static int pps_cdev_open(struct inode *inode, struct file *file)
{
        struct pps_device *pps = container_of(inode->i_cdev,
                                                struct pps_device, cdev);
        int found;
        spin_lock_irq(&idr_lock);
        found = idr_find(&pps_idr, pps->id) != NULL;
        /* Lock the PPS source against (possible) deregistration */
        if (found)
                atomic_inc(&pps->usage);
        spin_unlock_irq(&idr_lock);
        if (!found)
                return -ENODEV;
        file->private_data = pps;
        return 0;
}
Is that right?
