The disc is OK. No scratches and no fingerprints on the data side. The 
"position" of this error also seems to be not static. One boot before 
the one, where I saved the "ls -l" output, the directory "kde" has been 
unreadable. I unmounted and remounted the disc and immediately after 
that, all directories have been readable, again.
I was able to read exactly this disc with exactly this drive to get the 
MD5sum of the ISO on the disc. The MD5sum was OK. Even the gpgverify, I 
did immediately after the MD5sum, was OK. No read errors or any other 
problems.
The major problem is, that this one drove me nuts while installing 
Slackware, as I always was unsure if this silly installer now installed 
anything correctly or if I had read errors, again.
Why is this error gone after unmount/mount? Why isn't the kernel able to 
"reread" (retry) a part of the DVD, without the need to remount the 
whole disc?
Thanks very much in advance
