But nobody's talking about modifying Internet Explorer to automatically
send those numbers out over the web to track which sites you visit (the
"universal cookie" idea), but they _are_ talking about using the cpuid

Of course, if IE ever did that, somebody would make a binary patch to kill
that "feature".
