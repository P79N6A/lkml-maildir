AFAI am concerned, the whole thing's academic anyway. 
In my experience, if I get a 'should never happen' message, it's quite rare
that any existing debugging output is relevant. I usually need to add my own
printks to see what's happening. Often I end up just sending the entire report
directly to the maintainer of the offending section of code.
If it contains profanity, then it just simplifies my task - I can just send it
to DaveM without having to look up who the maintainer is :)
