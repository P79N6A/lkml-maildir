The way I interpreted Alan is that 
	make autoconfig
would spit out the default config, modified for the current setup, as
far as possible. So "my PCI devices" would be configured into the
kernel automatically (the way Linus likes it ;-). Similarly the
"complicated" CPU selection would be "don't touch unless you really
know what you're doing: autoconfig analized your cpuinfo". 
It would at least NOT INPACT anything in the current setup.
