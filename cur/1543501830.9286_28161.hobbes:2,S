OK, I have it now.

The Linux source code mentions them for the SysV filesystem driver.
Coherent is like V7, so it makes sense that both would have these.
I've added S_IFNWK, the /bin/ls type code for BSD whiteout,
and another table for non-type bits.
You can get HP-UX information at 
http://docs.hp.com
 if you have a
modern web browser. Right now I'm on a dumb connection with NO flow
control, and I'd love to know what that says about chmod(2), chmod(1),
ls(1), and stat(2).
BTW, I believe many of these can't actually exist on disk.
Some of these (like S_IFSHAD AFAIK) are not seen by userspace.
