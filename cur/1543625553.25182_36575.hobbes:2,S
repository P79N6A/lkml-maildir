Hi
Im writing (well porting) a driver for the INMOS G332 video chip
Just a quick ping to ask
1) Is anyone else doing this?
2) Is this of use to anyone in the MIPS community, where I believe these
chips are used occasionally?
The driver is for the Computer Concepts Colourcard on the Acorn Archimedes
(ARM machine)
