oops - the 64-bit processor.h bits were included by accident - updated 
patch below.

hm, what do you mean? There's no lock counter.

Subject: [patch] x86: fix spin-loop starvation bug
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
Miklos Szeredi reported very long pauses (several seconds, sometimes 
more) on his T60 (with a Core2Duo) which he managed to track down to 
wait_task_inactive()'s open-coded busy-loop. He observed that an 
interrupt on one core tries to acquire the runqueue-lock but does not 
succeed in doing so for a very long time - while wait_task_inactive() on 
the other core loops waiting for the first core to deschedule a task 
(which it wont do while spinning in an interrupt handler).
The problem is: both the spin_lock() code and the wait_task_inactive() 
loop uses cpu_relax()/rep_nop(), so in theory the CPU should have 
guaranteed MESI-fairness to the two cores - but that didnt happen: one 
of the cores was able to monopolize the cacheline that holds the 
runqueue lock, for extended periods of time.
This patch changes the spin-loop to assert an atomic op after every REP 
NOP instance - this will cause the CPU to express its "MESI interest" in 
that cacheline after every REP NOP.
