The OSS utilities for emu10k1 are very nice but no doubt they will eventually make their way to alsa.

As far as I can see from the alsa-devel lists, there have been patches to ensure sound is routed through the high quality components of Audigy cards to ensure the best sound quality and consistent sound levels through all channels. I definately noticed an improvement over the OSS Audigy driver which I used for over a year.
Maybe this is a SBLive specific problem ? Buy an Audigy :) Everything I've tried to do has worked perfectly with ALSA: 5.1 playback, digital out, AC3/DTS passthrough, recording from mic/line-in etc.
