Is procfs any better in this respect?!
Oh, and have you actually ever tried a system running devfs (such as a
kernel patched with Richard Gooch' patch, or a Solaris-system), or?
Hmmm. If USB isn't enough to convince, think about USB2 (128 devices/bus
if I'm not all wrong), FireWire, FibreChannel, SCSI-III, etc. Sooner or
later we need a solution to the problem with devices. And devfs is a very
good, thought-through, proven to work (been used in Solaris for many
years) and backward-compatible solution. And it's available now.
Why create something new, when there's a good solution already?
