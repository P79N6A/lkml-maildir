Posted yesterday to linux-serial with no response.
The OX16PCI954 UART contains a 9bit mode. I'm developing support for
it. I thought it would be easy to shoehorn into the UPF_* flags:

 #define UPF_LOW_LATENCY		(1 << 13)
 #define UPF_BUGGY_UART		(1 << 14)
 #define UPF_AUTOPROBE		(1 << 15)
However, in serial_core.c:set_uart_info(), there is a problem. The
flag should be within the purview of UPF_USR_MASK so that
non-privileged users can turn it on or off, and yet, I don't want the
mode to be enabled on UARTs that don't have it which requires
verification from the low-level driver. There is only one call to
ops->verify_port(), and it's not in the correct place for this to
happen.
So, I initially thought this patch would be best:

but I'm not sure that's not a security hole of some sort; revealing
that the setting is valid or invalid before revealing whether the user
is allowed to set it. So perhaps this is better:

but I don't like the duplication of code.
Any thoughts?
