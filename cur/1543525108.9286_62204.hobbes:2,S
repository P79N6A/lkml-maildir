Luckily I was feeling lazy that day.  Yeah, it's always nice to have
things that actually compile. ;)

Heres the new figures.  My poor harddisk must have aged a couple of years
for all the testing I've done lately.

Seems 2.2.14 elevator 4 has rewrite cured!  Mostly.  Dont know what
happened on the 2.3 equivilant run though?  I will rerun the test tomorrow
and if I get different figures (I shouldnt, bonnie seems fairly consistant
on those 500meg runs.. certainly no more then +/-3%) I will let you know.
Machine feels smoothish with the big dd going on.  I had a big dd along
with 4 compiles going and load up near 8 but interactive response was
still easily tollerable!!!  Happy happy... All on one disk of course.  I
also had a mp3 playing (xmms) and it didn't skip once.
