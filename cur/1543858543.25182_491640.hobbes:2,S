Educating the users may help, but it's hard to do the
education once they've already bought the hardware. Generally,
it would be 1) buy hardware 2) run whatever comes with it
3) try Linux. Hard to get the 'if you're ever thinking about
running Linux, don't buy XYZ' into that workflow.

This is the big point - we need to show the vendors how getting
upstream helps them.
Compare costs of all-in-house development versus shared-with-community
development.
Compare how quickly issues are fixed, and how often drivers actually
regress with in-tree vs. out-of-tree drivers.
Get case studies of drivers that have been opened (qeth? lpfc? Others?)
and get other companies to *go on the record* on how opening their
drivers and getting them upstream has helped them to lower their development
costs and scale their sales.
