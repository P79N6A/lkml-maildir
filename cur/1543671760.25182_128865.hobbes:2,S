I has nothing to do with gcc, Alan mentioned the magic (or cursed is
probably the better choice :) word, ACPI. The kernel in SLES 8 has
the x440 blacklisted so ACPI gets turned off automagically :)
As John mentioned, you can use a generic kernel provided its 
recent enough AND you configure it properly for the box.
