Okay, basically:
#define __USER_PTRS_PER_PGD	(TASK_SIZE/PGDIR_SIZE)
#define PARTIAL_PGD	(TASK_SIZE > __USER_PTRS_PER_PGD*PGDIR_SIZE ? 1 : 0)
#define PARTIAL_PMD	((TASK_SIZE % PGDIR_SIZE)/PMD_SIZE)
#define USER_PTRS_PER_PGD	(PARTIAL_PGD + __USER_PTRS_PER_PGD)
then
pgd_t *pgd_alloc(struct mm_struct *mm)
{
	int i;
	pgd_t *pgd = kmem_cache_alloc(pae_pgd_cachep, GFP_KERNEL);
	if (pgd) {
		for (i = 0; i < USER_PTRS_PER_PGD; i++) {
			unsigned long pmd = __get_free_page(GFP_KERNEL);
			if (!pmd)
				goto out_oom;
			clear_page(pmd);
			set_pgd(pgd + i, __pgd(1 + __pa(pmd)));
		}
		if (USER_PTRS_PER_PGD < PTRS_PER_PGD)
			memcpy(pgd + USER_PTRS_PER_PGD,
				swapper_pg_dir + USER_PTRS_PER_PGD,
				(PTRS_PER_PGD-USER_PTRS_PER_PGD)*sizeof(pgd_t));
		if (PARTIAL_PGD) {
			pgd_t *kpgd, *upgd;
			pmd_t *kpmd, *upmd;
			kpgd = pgd_offset_k(TASK_SIZE);
			upgd = pgd_offset(mm, TASK_SIZE);
			kpmd = pmd_offset(kpgd, TASK_SIZE);
			upmd = pmd_offset(upgd, TASK_SIZE);
			memcpy(upmd, kpmd, (PTRS_PER_PMD-PARTIAL_PMD)*sizeof(pmd_t));
		}
	}
	return pgd;
out_oom:
	for (i--; i >= 0; i--)
		free_page((unsigned long)__va(pgd_val(pgd[i])-1));
	kmem_cache_free(pae_pgd_cachep, pgd);
	return NULL;
}
etc.
