why did you make it a config option? This is the kind of thing that is
either good or isn't... at which point you can get rid of a lot of, if
not all the ugly ifdefs the patch adds.
Also, why does it need to enhance the random driver this much, the
random driver already has a facility to provide pseudorandom numbers
good enough for networking use (eg the PRNG rekeys often enough with
real entropy that brute forcing it shouldn't be possible).
If you can fix those 2 things the patch will look a lot cleaner and has
a lot higher chance to be merged.
