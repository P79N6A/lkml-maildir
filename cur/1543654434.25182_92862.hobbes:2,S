Given that you are saying that even synchronous RPC (which is the
default for r/wsize = 1024) is failing, then my 2 main suspicions are
  - hardware failure: Have you tried this on several different
    server/client combinations and hardware combinations?
  - gcc miscompile: which version of gcc are you using?
