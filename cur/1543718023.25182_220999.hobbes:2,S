I'm not sure I understand your message.
Are you suggesting
a) the hardware PCI id changed from 0x0008 to 0x0018 when booting 2.6.6.
	or
b) sis900.c changed when booting 2.6.6.
If "a", the PCI id in sis900.c seems to be 0x0008 in both 2.4 and 2.6. 
And further, I did not see any changes to this line of code in while 
searching 2.6.2 -> 2.6.6 patches on ftp.kernel.org.  I would lean 
towards a solution that modified sis900.c to check for -both- 0x08 and 0x18.
If "b", I bet that is a problem related to ACPI or some other 
non-sis900.c piece of code :)  sis900.c has not changed very much in the 
past several kernel releases.
