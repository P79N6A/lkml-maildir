Hi all, 
    I have following doubt. Please help me clear it.
If i create a new process using "kernel_thread" which later execs a
new program, then is this same as doing a fork followed by exec (because
during exec the process's address space will be reinitialized and the
reference count on old one will be decremented which 
it was sharing with the parent)?
Later, when the child process exits, will it have any effect on the parent's
context? (address space etc. - I have called kernel_thread with only
CLONE_VM (no CLONE_FS ...) set.
Thanks,
Sushil.
