Thanks a lot! I'll try and let you know the result.
I also think it should work on ramdisk, just want to know how it really works internally to help better understand. Any recommended readings or materials?

I never tried it, but I see no reason, why dm-crypt shouldn't work
on top of a ramdisk too. If you have any trouble with it, there
is a dm-crypt mailing list, and the author is very responsive.
