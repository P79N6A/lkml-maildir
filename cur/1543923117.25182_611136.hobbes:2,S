Yes, good idea for consistency.

This should be an _GPL export.  All new exports for above VFS users
like NFSD or stackable filesystem are _GPL because they're not for
general consumptions but these rather specific tied to the kernel
uses.
And while you're at it I'd suggest adding a docbook comment describing
the new export vfs_ioctl because we'd eventually like to have the exported
API documented fully.
