I make it a point to ignore postings which ignore
the recent mailing list history ;-)
This had been discussed on linux-dvb and the consensus was that
no one wants to invest time to maintain an #ifdef mess
just so that people can save a few KB in their kernel.
Also, most users don't know and don't care what demodulator
their card has, the dependency on all of them, plus the
implied auto probing saves them some headaches and us a lot of
newbie questions.

The b2c2-flexcop-pci driver could certainly use some fixing. Your
patch just hides the driver problems by deselecting functionality
that _you_ don't need.
