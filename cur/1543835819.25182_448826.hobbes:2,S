Can I ask that the known bugs in the I/O AT DMA code be fixed
before we start adding new features to it?
Specifically, the lock_cpu_hotplug() call in net_dma_rebalance()
is still there and being invoked with a spinlock held.  The
spinlock is grabbed by the caller, netdev_dma_event() which
grabs the net_dma_event_lock spinlock.
You cannot invoke lock_cpu_hotplug() while holding a spinlock
because lock_cpu_hotplug(), as seen in kernel/cpu.c, takes
a semaphore which can sleep.  Sleeping while holding a spinlock
is not allowed.
This is the second time I have tried to make the Intel developers
aware of this bug.  So please fix this problem.
Thanks a lot.
