Subject: 2.6.8-rc2-mm2 vs prune_dcache, -mm2 wins (I think)

Greetings;
I noted there was a patch to fs/dcache.c in -mm2, so I built it.
I may be a bit premature here, but I seem to have made it thru the 4am 
cron driven stuff without a killer Oops from prune_dcache and friends 
such as I have posted several times about (but everyone was at 
conventions)
I had those with 2.6.7, but they were generally not fatal.  Starting 
with 2.6.7-mm1, they generally were fatal to the whole machine, in 
one instance requireing a full powerdown before it would reboot.
From 2.6.7-mm1 on most of the time it didn't make it to the log, the 
system was gone before the log could be written out.
My uptime:
root@coyote root]# uptime
 04:32:59 up 14:52,  4 users,  load average: 2.55, 2.59, 2.97
Over half a day now!
This seems to be a genuine improvement, many many thanks.
