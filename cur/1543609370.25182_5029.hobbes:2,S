Hi,
[ Please CC me any replies as I'm not on the list ]
	I'm afraid I've just run in an embarassing iptables « bug » on
2.4.13-ac7. When I tell iptables to drop unclean packets with ecn on I
can no longuer connect to ftp.kernel.org, and get a lot of ipt_unclean:
TCP reserved bits not zero in the logs. Shouldn't iptables be made
ecn-aware ? (especially given all the red-inked comments on ECN in the
FAQ)
	Regards,
-- 
Nicolas
