Subject: [RFC PATCH 0/3]  VFS changes to collapse all the vectored and AIO support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
These series of changes collapses all the vectored IO support 
into single file-operation method using aio_read/aio_write. 
This work was originally suggested & started by Christoph Hellwig, 
when Zach Brown tried to add vectored support for AIO. 
Christoph & Zach, comments/suggestions ? If you are happy with the
work, can you add your Sign-off or Ack ? I addressed all the
known issues, please review.
Here is the summary:
[PATCH 1/3] Vectorize aio_read/aio_write methods
[PATCH 2/3] Remove readv/writev methods and use aio_read/aio_write
instead.
[PATCH 3/3] Zach's core aio changes to support vectored AIO.
NOTE: This is not ready for -mm or mainline consumption yet -
since I am still doing basic testing. 
Comments ?
Thanks,
Badari
