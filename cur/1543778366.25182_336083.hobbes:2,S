Yeah, there was one of these in the box with the drive, but the first time
I saw it I remember thinking: what the hell is this thing? Then when I
figured it out, I found myself wondering whether the USB interface was
ever planed for such a such and whether it wouldn't have been better to
just ship a real adapter with the thing ...
Anyhow, I will not be using the drive anymore without a powered hub.
Thanks for all those that helped,
Karim
