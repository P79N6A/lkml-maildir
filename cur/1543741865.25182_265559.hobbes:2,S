I think the cause was covered in another post, I'm surprised that the 
page overhead is reported as user time. It would have been a good hint 
if the big jump were in system time.
Yes, I know some kernel time is charged to the user, I'm just not sure 
diddling the page tables should be, since it might mask the effect of vm 
changes, etc.
That's comment not a suggestion.
