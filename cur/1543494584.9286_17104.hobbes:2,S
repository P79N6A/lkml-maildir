I sent a mail which apparently got clogged in our gateway and
will probably reach you after a day or two... anyway some of it
has been repeated by others, but among other things I asked:
> I don't know anything about how the kernel works, and if this

Well from the active discussion it sounds like it does belong
here :)

Again, two specific problems I had in mind were mentioned by
someone else: NFS and memory management. NFS is around 4 times
slower than on other machines (it used to be 10 times slower in
2.0.x), and memory hogging programs sometimes bring the system to
a crawl. But he may have ideas which have little to do with what
the users see.
Apologies in advance for a mail which will land on the list in
the unpredictable future, probably after the discussion dies
down...
