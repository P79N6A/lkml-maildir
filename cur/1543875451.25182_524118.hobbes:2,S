thanks! I have stared at hrtimer.c a few more hours and the good news is 
that i found a narrow SMP race. The bad news is that i dont think it 
could explain your bug symptoms: the worst-case effect of the race 
should be an incorrect timeout on the current CPU - not a KTIME_MAX 
thing like your logs show.
But maybe i didnt think through the effects of the bug well enough, and 
your box has a HT CPU, with HT CPUs being pretty good at triggering 
narrow SMP races - so maybe we are lucky? Fix attached below. Patch is 
build and boot-tested.

Subject: [patch] hrtimers: fix reprogramming SMP race
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
hrtimer_start() incorrectly set the 'reprogram' flag to 
enqueue_hrtimer(), which should only be 1 if the hrtimer is queued to 
the current CPU.
doing otherwise could result in a reprogramming of the current CPU's 
clockevents device, with a timer that is not queued to it - resulting in 
a bogus next expiry value.
