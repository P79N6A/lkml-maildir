Each userspace-accessible IB device gets a single device node like
/dev/infiniband/uverbsX.  Opening that gives userspace a "context".
One of the things userspace can do with that fd is mmap() on it --
that was originally envisioned as a way to map a page of hardware
registers directly in to the userspace process.
It seems ehca needs to allocate lots of different things in the kernel
via mmap().  What you're saying I guess is that ideally each of these
would be mmap() on a different fd rather than using different
offsets.  It's a little awkward to open multiple device nodes to get
multiple fds, since there's not a good way to attach them all to the
same context.  I guess we could create some hack to return more file
handles, but I think that cure is worse than the disease of using
magic offsets...
Maybe longer term we need to look at a scheme like cell's spufs but
I'm still not confident we have the RDMA interface quite ready to
freeze at the system call level.
