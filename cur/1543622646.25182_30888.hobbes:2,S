Yes, and that's what I found as well.  That was my first patch until I
noticed the AUTO check in the VIA driver around this same code.
That being said, which of these solutions is worthy of going into the
kernel (if any) and should that decision be applied to the other IDE
drivers?
I feel like I'm okay with my own little patchbase, but this seems like a
useful type of change to make for everyone and all drivers in 2.4 (and
2.5 if it's even still applicable).  And it's just dirt simple enough
for me to do it. ;)
Thanks,
