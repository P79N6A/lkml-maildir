Subject: Variation in measure_migration_cost() with scheduler-cache-hot-autodetect.patch in -mm

I'm consistently getting a smaller than expected cache migration cost
as measured by Ingo's scheduler-cache-hot-autodetect.patch currently
in -mm tree.  In this patch, the memory used to calibrate migration
cost is obtained by vmalloc call.  Would it make sense to use
__get_free_pages() instead?  I did the following experiments on a
variety of machines I have access to:
				migration cost		migration cost
				with vmalloc mem		with __get_free_pages
3.0GHz Xeon, 8MB cache		6.23 ms		6.32 ms
3.4GHz Xeon, 2MB cache		1.62 ms		2.00 ms
1.6GHz Itanium2, 9MB		9.2 ms		10.2 ms
1.4GHz Itanium2, 4MB		4.2 ms		 4.4 ms
Why the discrepancy?  Possible cache coloring issue?
