They have a clustering concept in their volume management that isn't
expressable with something like LVM. That justifes their approach from
what I can see.

Write allocation for these kinds of system (especially when concerned
with mirroring) is non-trivial.

You also can't use the standard page cache to buffer all of the sophicated
semantics of these systems and have to create your own.

I think they are still talking and it's far from over the last I heard.
The creation of a new inode and decending indirect blocks is a fundamental
concept behind WAFL. Also ZFS tends to be a heavy weight as far as
metadata goes and quite possibly uneccessarily so which is likely to effect
performance for things related to keep a relevant block allocation map in
memory. ZFS is a complete pig compared to traditional file systems.

That doesn't really matter. FUSE could be extended to handle this kind
of stuff and still have it be in userspace. The BSD get around including
Stephen Tweedy's (sp?) ext2 header file by making the user manually
compile it. That's not a problem for Linux folks that can download a
patch and compile a kernel.
FreeBSD already has a port of ZFS. Just for a kick, Google for that as
a possible basis for a Linux kernel port.
