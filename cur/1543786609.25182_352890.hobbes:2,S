If you need vgacon, you can't, unless you have the BIOS capability.
If you enable the framebuffer and the framebuffer console, you can select
which driver/hardware pair gets mapped to the console using the boot option:
fbcon=map:n (0 for the first framebuffer, 1 for the 2nd, etc as they would
	appear in /proc/fb)
