[ numerous problems with this approach ]
So replace it with the current user's maximum, multiply by two (for those 
who want to use different slots for read and write), and add a small
fudge factor. If you really need it.
Personally, though, I think that it's not very sensible to always use 
poll(a_whole_lot) even if you've got only two files open, and it's even
less sensible to use different slots for read and write. Using the current
maximum instead isn't exactly rocket science to code, and sharing the
read and the write side in one slot isn't either.
Personally, I wouldn't let programs written with that kind of "let's eat
kernel performance on each poll() instead of adding five cheap lines of
code when the pollfd[] is set up" mindset near my system anyway if I can
at all help it. :-/
