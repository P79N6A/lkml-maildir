generally that's a sign that the approach might not be the best one.
Lets face it: we're trying to estimate behavior here. Result: There
ALWAYS will be mistakes in that estimator. The more complex the
estimator the fewer such cases you will have, but the more mis-estimated
such cases will be.
The only way to really deal with estimators is to *ALSO* make the price
you pay on mis-estimation acceptable. For the scheduler that most likely
means that you can't punish as hard as we do now, nor give bonuses as
much as we do now.
