As it turns out, the values do fit into a 32 bit space, since they are
a result of shifts and truncates.  Perhaps a simple cast in the switch
statement is all I need.

I think either will work.
Is there a little FAQ of C constructions you should not use if you
are writing kernel code?  It took a little doing to figure out that
it was the switch that was causing trouble and not the shifts and
arithmetic operations, and I'd like to avoid that in the future  :-).
