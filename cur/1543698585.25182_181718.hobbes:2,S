So - as sick as it sounds - jffs2 may actually be the fs of choice
when doing encryption, even though working on a hard drive and not
flash.  Cool. :)

Depends on how much security you really care about.  If you really
don't mind the pain involved, some metadata should explicitly *not* be
encrypted, to avoid known plaintext attacks.  To a serious attacker,
this could be a death stroke for ext[23] over cryptoloop, actually.
In real life, though, the humans are usually the weakest link, so this
doesn't matter anyway.

Trivial, as long as you can live with a single key for the whole
filesystem.  If that is not acceptable, there may even be problems in
the vfs already.
