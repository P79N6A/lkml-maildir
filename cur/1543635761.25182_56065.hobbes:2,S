Hi,
struct device contains a void * driver_data. It should certainly point to 
a couple of bytes where the driver data was saved.
In line 288, we have this:
current_driverfs_dev->driver_data = (void *)__mkdev(hd->major, minor+part);
What kind of pointer should we get here? ;-)
Can the author please explain what was intented here?
							Regards,
							Thunder
