is the switch_stack the same thing as the kernel stack? If yes then we 
want to have something like:
	prefetch(kernel_stack(next));
to make it more generic. By default kernel_stack(next) could be
next->thread_info (to make sure we prefetch something real). On e.g.
x86/x64, kernel_stack(next) should be something like next->thread.esp.
