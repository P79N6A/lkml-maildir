OK, the hardirq_count() thing is not HARDIRQ_OFFSET all the time. When
we interrupt a hard irq, we are already using the hard irq stack and
thus irq_enter() in do_IRQ() works as it should. The zero value for hi
is there with IO-APIC and 8K stacks as well, so that's either right or
an other bug.
Still no idea why your "fix" works, but the following patch also fixes
the problem and is at least a little more like the RightThing.
---
Copy the softirq bits in preempt_count from the current context into the
hardirq context when using 4K stacks to make the softirq_count macro work
correctly and thereby fix softirq cpu time accounting.
