Nope.  The C language is defined like that, it is *not* a
gcc oddity!  This works with any C compiler.
You may dislike it but you can't change the standard.

Wrong!  if (i=foo()) {} is equivalent to i=foo(); if (i) {}
"=" is just an assignment, and returns the value assigned.  There is no
similiarity to the comparison operator "==" other than the fact
that both are written using equal signs. 
That's how C works - live with it!

No, gcc doesn't "fix" anything.  You get a warning because writing "="
in a if-test is a common typo among C beginners and people who
program other languages such as pascal. (Pascal use "=" for comparison)
It is just a warning that something might be wrong.  I always turn it
off as it annoys me.  A good C programmer shouldn't have trouble
with it and it is perfectly readable for those fluent in C.
Some people thinks if (a=b) is bad practice, some like it.  It
is definitely not a compiler bug though.
