vfork(2) has very weird semantics, if you follow the relevant standards by
the letter you can't do anything at all except exec(2) immediately.  Thus
it is almost completely useless. vfork(2) was introduced to avoid copying a
memory space just to discard it immediately on exec(2). With modern COW
fork(2)s, it isn't needed (and many Unices don't have a real vfork(2)
anymore, it is just an alias for fork(2) so you don't have to redo all your
legacy applications).
