Thanks for your detailed response.

Are you sure about that? I don't doubt that many operating systems
handle all devices, that are able to understand the SCSI command set,
exactly as you describe it, but Linux doesn't assume such separate
virtual SCSI buses for non good old Parallel SCSI drives, not even
internally, as far as I understand it. Of course it doesn't use file
names internally, it uses major and minor numbers, but that shouldn't
matter, the major and minor numbers get exported to userspace via sysfs.

That's the point where you're not quite right, if I understand it
correctly. The Linux kernel does not artificially prevent userspace
applications viewing virtual SCSI buses, these virtual SCSI buses don't
exist internally in the Linux kernel at all. So Linux doesn't
artificially prevent anything, it just doesn't artificially _create_
virtual SCSI buses.

Well, please show me how to get the list of all possible hosts that talk
TCP/IP and are directly or indirectly connected to my computer. As my
computer is attached to the internet, the list would get pretty long...
And even if only considering hosts in the local network, how do you get
a unified view of all TCP/IP hosts conected to any of my two network
adapters?

Why do you believe that Linux needs to do the same as every other OS?
I'd agree with you if Linux would violate a standard but AFAIK the bus
view with target ids is not part of the ATAPI or a dependant standard.
Please correct me if I'm wrong but the bus/target/lun combination is
only a standard for some SCSI transports, at least it is for good old
Parallel SCSI, yes, but SCSI over ATA doesn't define target-based
addressing.

Great, I have no objections but you shouldn't mandate the Linux kernel
developers to implement a copy of implementations other operating
systems provide. If the virtual SCSI bus and/or full SCSI emulation
would be part of POSIX or an other standard Linux tries to follow, Linux
should implement it, of course, but last time I checked, it's not in
POSIX.

Linux' device nodes is such an orthogonal view that should include all
devices able to speak SCSI among others. Enumeration is possible via
sysfs (low-level) or much easier via the userspace HAL library from
freedesktop.org.

If there is a device that supports the SCSI command set and the device
can't be accessed with SG_IO in linux, I'd call this a Linux kernel bug.
You mentioned ATAPI tapes before; if that's really the case, it's a
Linux bug, yes, but it seems that nobody cares about speaking SCSI with
these device types. That happens in projects with limited resources.
My point is that this shouldn't matter to cdrecord. It does matter to
tape drive applications that use libscg, of course. File a bug in
bugzilla about that and if ATAPI tapes are important to a Linux
developer, he will probably implement it. But a Linux bug affecting some
device or bus types doesn't automatically mean that the whole Linux
kernel device addressing is broken by design.
