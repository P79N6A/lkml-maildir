hmm, looks like we are dancing around in circles here
so please forgive my direct (and repeated) question:
_what_ do you consider 'logically organized' because
putting all the CLONE_* stuff into a separate file is
pretty logical for me ... but obviously not for you.
I have absolutely no problem with different, more
logical splitups, and I'm willing to break down the
entire sched.h if that will help the cause ... so
please enlighten me here ...
TIA,
Herbert
