OK, minor error there - "tmp" is an int in ext2_new_block, while "block"
is a long in ext2_free_blocks (I had changed it to a long in my tree and
didn't see the warning when it compiled).  I should probably submit a
patch at some point, but for now 32 bits is enough.

??? My patch doesn't touch nor use these labels.

??? This is pretty bad - usually signal 11 from GCC means RAM problems.
