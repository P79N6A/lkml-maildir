A new development version of LTT is now available, 0.9.6pre2.
Here's what's new:
- Per-CPU buffering
- TSC timestamping
- Use of syscall interface instead of char dev abstraction
The release includes a patch for 2.5.43 which is pretty much ready
for inclusion. I will be posting this patch raw ot the LKML with
a more verbose description.
You will find 0.9.6pre2 here:
