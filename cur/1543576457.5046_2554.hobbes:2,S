Granted, it's just an example, but it doesn't make sense to wake up more
dmabuf_alloc waiters than you actually have buffers for.  You do one
up() per freed buffer, and the semaphore's wait queue better be fifo or
have some other way of ensuring a task doesn't languish there.  (I don't
know, does it?)

Yes, and a third example of the 'unlock/wakeup_and_sleep' kind of
primitive - there seems to be a pattern.  I should at least take a look
and see if up_down is easy or hard to implement.
