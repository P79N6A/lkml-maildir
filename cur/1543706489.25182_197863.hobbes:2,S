Hey that will work only for %x, not %d.
BTW, man printf says:
The character L specifying that a following e, E, f, g, or G
conversion corresponds to a long double argument, or a following
d, i, o, u, x, or X conversion corresponds to a long long argument.
Note that long long is not specified in ANSI C and therefore
not portable to all architectures.
