Sadly it's true, but in the other hand I haven't seen something like gnome/kde
which don't eats lots of resources (mac os x and XP are not better, beos was
better they say), which makes me think that building a  desktop environment
without eating lots of resources is not easy. Well, and your projct is also
bloat in some ways...it's small and all that but putting a graphics system
inside the kernel is one of the best definitions of "bloat" you can find...
