Linus had no problem with changing his opinion after strong words in the
past :)
But what exactly is the problem with a changing defintion for you.  There
is neither a stable kernel nor a formal glibc release with this defined
out yet.  That means the ABI isn't formalized and the number can be
allocated where it belongs.
Who cares what Linus said in the past as long as Linux development goes
to the right direction?
