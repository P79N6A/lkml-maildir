After some investigation, there turned out only to be one, so this is
the final bug fix I have in SCSI.
It's in
master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jejb/scsi-rc-fixes-2.6.git
but since there's only one, I also attach it below.

Subject: [SCSI] 3w-xxxx: fix oops caused by incorrect REQUEST_SENSE handling
3w-xxxx emulates a REQUEST_SENSE response by simply returning nothing.
Unfortunately, it's assuming that the REQUEST_SENSE command is
implemented with use_sg == 0, which is no longer the case.  The oops
occurs because it's clearing the scatterlist in request_buffer instead
of the memory region.
This is fixed by using tw_transfer_internal() to transfer correctly to
the scatterlist.
