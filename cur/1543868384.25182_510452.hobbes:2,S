Actually, I think my problem with this was dbs_info->sample_type, but reading
it again, I'm not sure that it's actually a problem as the work function will
probably not ever be executing on two or more CPUs simultaneously because of
the deferral time involved.
So, your patch is probably fair enough.  Certainly, deletion isn't a problem.
