   How is the client socket supposed to know it received a TCP reset
   (I am talking from the application point of view, not the kernel...) ?
You may find out by attempting to read data, or you may use the
extended IP error reporting Linux has.
But all of this is irrelevant.  When a server closes and says "send me
no more data", this implies that the server told the client it doesn't
want any more data.  If the client sends data, this is a gross fatal
error, so TCP resets in FIN_WAIT{1,2} states.
RFC 793 originally specified to queue the data, RFC 1122 is where
the current behavior is defined.
