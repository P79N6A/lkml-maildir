There is no display. The program just marks the blank scene or scene 
changes and dumps the results to a text file for another program to 
analyze.

No, I am not that brave. :) However, I am now faily certain it is not 
heat problem. After relinked with a new libmpeg binary, it hasn't 
rebooted yet (8+hours). Any possibility that some binary code can 
randomly trigger reboots on certain CPUs? (Sounds absurd, but only you 
kernel guys have better answers.)
Now I am concerned with the `D' state. Is that some problem from the 
kernel?
Thanks.
