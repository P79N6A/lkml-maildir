Hello group, I have some concern about scheduling issue with 2.4.16 and 
2.4.22 i386 kernel where I see 1200+ interrupts and context switches per 
second through vmstat when machine is under load. Is this behavior 
normal? Is there any know scheduling issue with the above mentioned 
kernel versions?
Thanks,
Fei
