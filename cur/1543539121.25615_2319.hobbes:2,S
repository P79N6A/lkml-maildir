The card works fine with kernel 2.2.17pre12 in the same machine.
With 2.4.0-test4, if I compile the de4x5 driver into the kernel it
locks up on boot after it has detected the SCSI disks. Just before it
normally would display the network devices.
If I try insmod: 
# insmod de4x5.o 
de4x5.o: init_module: Input/output error
The tulip driver does not find the card at all neither with a 2.2 nor
a 2.4 kernel.
Any help would be much appreciated.
