/proc/ide/<chipset> is the smallest problem
Don't waste your time on it, I've almost killed this bloat in my tree.

These issues can't be solved without refcounting.
Feel free to probe me wrong, you can start with fixing
->open vs unregister race (drive->usage involved). :)

ioctls on not present devices are layering VIOLATION

I'm sure there is more.

gendisk layer and block layer enforces you to make /dev/hda disappear.
Does sysfs ring any bells?  Ask viro about static objects vs sysfs.
And yes not only gendisk and block enforces this, Patrick added basic,
premature sysfs support to IDE driver in the middle of 2.5 series.
We can get back to discussion when you get familiar with issues involved.
