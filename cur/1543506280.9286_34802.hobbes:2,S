You are suggesting, then that we wait for MJ2, live with SPAM (if we
must) in the meantime, and help out on MJ2 as far as our meager natures
and already busy lives permit?
Sounds reasonable.  All the solutions posted (well, almost all) have
sounded reasonable, but they also sound like a pain to set up and the
pain is mostly wasted if a "proper" solution is around the corner.  So
this sounds like the "most" reasonable solution posted -- one that will
leverage future-but-in-the-pipe improvements in the underlying list
server.
