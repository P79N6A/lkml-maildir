What about that:
 10:42pm  up 10:09,  2 users,  load average: 1.40, 1.31, 1.28
166 processes: 163 sleeping, 3 running, 0 zombie, 0 stopped
CPU0 states:  0.0% user, 97.0% system,  0.0% nice,  2.0% idle
CPU1 states:  0.1% user, 21.0% system,  0.0% nice, 77.0% idle
Mem:  2061632K av, 2057024K used,    4608K free,       0K shrd,   55412K buff

It's looks strange and danger. On this machine squid and INN running.
Swap is on still level, but 99.9% for CPU? System without tmpfs, but
with resierfs (50GB of squid spool on 5 partitions).
