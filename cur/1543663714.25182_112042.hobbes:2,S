There is an additional catch with the resources to be careful of.
Some environments require we register/unregister additional
IRQ routing tables. Thats a minor problem but does affect things
like IBM thinkpad 600 docking station. Thats a transparent
bridge with devices that appear and vanish stuck behind it.
Similar problems - it needs
	pci_attach_behind_bridge()
	pci_destroy_behind_bridge()
functionality just like the cardbus toys
