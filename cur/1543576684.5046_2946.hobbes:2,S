Use two PDC controller cards. You have shown that you can read 50MB/s from 
disks into memory, and so neither the IDE not PCI bus is overloaded. 
However, the RAID code is contending for control of the IDE busses because 
it is not optimized for the case that the disks cannot be controlled 
independently.

Did you not read the RAID FAQ? look on the raidtools web site: it 
specifically states:
a) you cannot hot swap IDE
b) if you put RAID disks on the same IDE bus (i.e. use master/slave) you 
can expect abysmal performance. Only use the master for a given IDE bus 
(i.e. the PDC supports 2, not 4, disks).

On IDE, you don't. IDE never supports hot-swap, RAID or no. If you want 
that, use SCSI.
