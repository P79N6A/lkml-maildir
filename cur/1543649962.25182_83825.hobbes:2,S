(1.5MB?  I remember hitting the 1MB wall even after grabbing 1.6c.  hmm..)
I went back and double-checked my loadlin version, and it turned out I was 
actually using 1.6a due to a fat finger.  Version 1.6c booted fine (only 
one kernel tested) without Eric's help.  1.6a definitely needs Eric's help 
to boot.
(gee, it works.  sure hope I don't hit the new lard limit any time soon;)
