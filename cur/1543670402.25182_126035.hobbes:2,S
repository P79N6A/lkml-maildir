  All is not beer and skittles here with Andrea's kernel, though.
Sometimes instead of 31MB/sec I get this with 1 sequential stream:
 1  0  0      0   1232   1120  47988   0   0 14928     0 3834  7534   1  44  55
 1  0  0      0   1372   1120  47848   0   0 14704     0 3778  7446   0  32  68
 1  0  0      0   1464   1064  47816   0   0 14880     0 3822  7501   1  43  56

 1  0  0      0   1432   1064  47848   0   0 14748    32 3800  7467   0  41  59
 1  0  0      0   1532   1064  47748   0   0 13976     0 3596  7045   1  33  66
  Pretty high context switch and interrupt rates for a PPro 200, huh?
  And I can't reliably reproduce it (so far...)
