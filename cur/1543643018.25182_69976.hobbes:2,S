Sounds about average for a P3.  I have pushed the full 800MiB/s out of
a P3 processor to memory but it was a very optimized loop.  Is
that 420MB/sec of IO on this test?

Note quite.  But you suck at least 240MB/s of your memory bandwidth with
DMA from disk, and then DMA to the nic.  Unless there is a highly
cached component.  So I doubt you can effectively use more than 1 gige
card, maybe 2.  And you have 8?

Wow the hardware designers really believed in over-subscription.
If the busses are just running 64bit/33Mhz you are oversubscribed.
And at 64bit/66Mhz the pci busses can easily swamp the system 
533*4 ~= 2128MB/s. 
What kind of memory bandwidth does the system have, and on which
bus are the memory controllers?  I'm just curious
