 Yes.  But, from your later comments I wonder if my description is
insufficiently clear:  the loss of functionality appears to be wholly
within gdm - that is, it's login window, and the confirm dialog
disappear but the background remains (covering all the screen) and
gdm is still running.  I switch to a tty (as I've done now) and I
can then reboot, or shutdown as the root user.
 Meanwhile, top shows two instances of gdm-binary and Xorg are still
running - I assume the two instances are normal.

 For the first attempt, I've kept to my old logging (kernel messages
in kern.log, generality in sys.log), so I've put both there.  This
is done manually (I don't have a mouse in the tty to copy the
script).  Log was about 200K, but after gzipping, it reduces to 18K
so I'll attach it.  This is a number of minutes after I tried to
shutdown from gdm (time to login on a tty, ssh to where the mail is,
and then start replying).
 I don't quite understand the 'Gnome shutdown through command line'
part, and perhaps I don't have that part of gnome compiled (I only
have what I need for the applets and applications that I use).  If
it's important, please specify in detail how you want me to
shutdown.
 If for some reason this log doesn't suit you, I'll copy your script
and do it all exactly.
Ken
