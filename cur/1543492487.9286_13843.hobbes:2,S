Well, when I 'cp sendmail' as root, the resulting binary is setuit root.
Maybe you misunderstand the idea: current fs's & tools don't support the
notion of per-file capabilities, but they _do_ support the notion of
'setuid 0' which traditionally made a binary 'all-powerful'.  With this
scheme, we redefine the notion of 'setuid 0' to mean that a binary has
some cap's raised, and stored in the elf headers.
The problem is, to get good semantics, there are a lot of repercussions
which all need to be thought out.  For instance, I now find that besides
needing to store the true owner of the file in the headers, we also need
to store the true value of the setuid bit, to determine whether the file
actually executes as the owner or not.  (group info is _not_ needed)

The same should definitely apply here; though if the user has capA & capB
raised, the file should be allowed those.  (this is why the actuall coding
get's deep quick)

Currently the notion of 'setuid root' propagates all over _anyway_ if root
is copying the file.  This just puts a finer grain on the propagation of
capabilities.
