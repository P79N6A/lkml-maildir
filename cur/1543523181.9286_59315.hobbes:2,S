I've put up a webpage with some of my brief experiences getting Linux
working on the decked-out Compaq 8500 I've gotten access to at work. 
What's there:
A little more info on what hardware is in it from what I last posted and
a little bit more info on what I've gotten and haven't gotten working
yet.
Oops run through ksymoops from the 2.3.39 kernel that panics during PCI
probing.
Output of 'lspci -vvx' as requested by Martin Mares.
Output of 'cat /proc/cpuinfo' because it's just cool.
