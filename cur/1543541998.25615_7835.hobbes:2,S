This is where I start rolling around all over the floor laughing at various
people...
Under pressure from others, I moved all the drivers I used to have in
arch/arm/drivers in the 2.0 trees into the generic drivers/* directories.
It now seems that these "others" were wrong for the ARM specific drivers.
I do now agree that all drivers should be placed in the drivers
subdirectory, and not anywhere under arch/*/drivers since, when some
people go around checking net device drivers, they ONLY look in
drivers/net, and nowhere else.
I'm even considering moving drivers/acorn/net to drivers/net/acorn (and
similarly for the others) so that when changes do occur, these drivers
also get a look in.
However, having said that, I think drivers/media is a good idea, but
do we have enough drivers or separation to warrant drivers/media/radio
and drivers/media/video?  I'm willing to pick this change up btw, if no
one objects.
