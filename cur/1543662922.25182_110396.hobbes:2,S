Subject: [PATCH] BUG() call in vmalloc.c causes segmentation fault.

In the function __vmalloc() in mm/vmalloc.c. The function
is parsing the "size" parameter passed to it. If the request
is of zero bytes or if it is greater than num_physpages,
then __vmalloc calls BUG(). The NULL pointer is never
returned, which causes the segmentation fault.  This BUG()
call was correctly removed for 2.5.
