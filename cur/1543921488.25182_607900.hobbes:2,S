Hi,
I've run into a problem where a process trying to connect to a local
port within the local port range eventually ends up connected to itself,
with source port = dest port.
similar behavior can be gotten by running netcat as follows:
nc -p 1025 localhost 1025
I'm not really sure if that's a bug, but the original case was at least
unexpected.
Regards,
	Tal Kelrich
