I like gadget! It's unambiguous namespace with a ring.
Target sounds to much like a cross-compiler; and boring.

"gadget" is nice.  It's descriptive of what the code is for, without the
bad connotations that "slave" seems to have.
Although those people who actually take USB seriously might not like it
so much, but I don't see any of those people doing Linux development
anyway :)
thanks,
