The later.  Some believe someone on your local network, who understands
the timing of the physical layers and devices, can influence the entropy
pool.  Further, then, we assume SHA is cracked.  Then they know enough
state and can presumably determine the output of [u]random.
Of course, this is all theoretical but I would not gamble in certain
situations either.  In some, like my workstation on my network, I feel
safe and enjoy having sshd not block waiting for entropy.  So I wrote
the netdev-random stuff...
Note the patches work in the converse manner, too: _today_ there are
network drivers that contribute entropy.  With netdev-random you can
stop that if you wish.

Possibly.

Under load the execution of softinterrupts is virtually
non-deterministic, so they do help but we do the timing off the
interrupt handler itself.
