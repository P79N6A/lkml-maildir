(As I wrote in the other message just sent) I wonder if it's a good idea to
introduce an "override default PCI suspend/resume" flag for this purpose.
The drivers that want to handle the PCI stuff themselves would be able to use
this flag to tell the core not to try to power manage the device etc.
Alternatively, the core may check the state_saved bit and look at current_state
to see if the device need not be put into a low power state.  Still, putting
the device into a low power state need not be desirable anyway.

It actually has been confirmed recently that this is a real issue.  Sadly.

OK, I see your point.

I know.  Still, all of the drivers that implement suspend-resume put the
devices into low power states in ->suspend and it's never been observed to
be a source of problems.
Unfortunately, on many systems we are supposed to use ACPI for putting PCI
devices into low power states and right now we can't do that with interrupts
off due to the limitations of our AML interpreter.
The same applies to resume, BTW, but resume is easier, because devices tend
to already be in D0 from the start.  Admittedly, though, we may have a problem
with devices that are not in D0 at that point and _require_ ACPI to power them
up (ie. don't support the native PCI PM).  Not that I know of any, but still.
ISTR that some devices will not wake up the system if they are not put into
the low power state by ACPI during suspend.
So, I wonder.  Do we need to make the AML interpreter allow us to run code
with interrupts off?

Yes, the bridges with drivers are somewhat special.
