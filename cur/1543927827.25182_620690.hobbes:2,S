The only legitimate possibility of having the fair_sched_class
returning no task in this case is when 'rq->nr_running ==
rq->cfs.nr_running == 0'.
iow, a possible optimization would be just the following check :
if (rq->nr_running == 0)
        return idle_sched_class.pick_next_task(rq);
at the beginning of pick_next_task().
(or maybe put it at the beginning of the
if (likely(rq->nr_running == rq->cfs.nr_running)) {} block as we
already have 'likely()' there).
