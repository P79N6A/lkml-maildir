Separate set of patches.  As it is, struct hd_struct is still there and
still not modified.  And it has unsigned long.  It will become sector_t.
Actually, I'm not all that sure that we want u64 here.  The thing being,
start_sect shouldn't be bigger than sector_t (see how it's used).  And
64bit arithmetics on 32bit boxen sucks big way.  I'm not too concerned
about adding start_sect per se - it's done once per request and it's
noise compared to the rest of work.  However, long long for sector_t
will hit in a lot of more interesting code paths.
That stuff becomes an issue for 2Tb disks.  Do we actually have something
that large attached to 32bit boxen?

... and still use i386 with these disks?  ia64 is stillborn, but x86-64
promises to be more useful than Itanic.
u64 for sector_t doesn't change anything for 64bit boxen that might be
interested in really large disks and screws 32bit ones that shouldn't
have to pay for that...
