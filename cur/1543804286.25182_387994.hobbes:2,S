I saw that after, but let's say a thing which I always forgot to say:
we're often using void * in protos when we can't include a type declaration in 
the needed file.
Gerd Knorr in his tty patch, instead, used forward declarations, like:
struct task_struct; 
what about that?
Those functions probably should be moved anyway because they're useless there, 
but I'm using this occasion to avoid forgetting this.
