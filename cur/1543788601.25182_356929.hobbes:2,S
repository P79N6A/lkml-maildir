Hello,
I'm trying to synchronize with my iPaq (rx3715) and get the following error
(in dmesg):
usb 1-1: new full speed USB device using ohci_hcd and address 9
ipaq 1-1:2.0: PocketPC PDA converter detected
drivers/usb/serial/ipaq.c: active config #2 != 1 ??
ipaq: probe of 1-1:2.0 failed with error -5
I have kernel 2.6.12-1-amd64-k8 from the Debian/AMD64 Etch distribution.
P.S. I've read sources a bit and found that the USB active configuration
can be selected by the hotplug, but it is not clear how (and if it can solve
the problem).
WBR,
Ivan Dubrov.
