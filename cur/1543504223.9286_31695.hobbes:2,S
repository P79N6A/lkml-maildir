From your answer, I assume it does not exist _yet_. Is that correct ??
What I'm looking for is a driver _already in the kernel_ that would allow
me to tell it "watch this interrupt line and tell me when it is asserted,
and I will then handle the interrupt request".
Or (if possible) register the interrupt _from userspace_ and handle it
directly. Is it possible ?!?!

The problem with that is that you're assuming there is already a driver
for this specific device. I'm trying to write a HW test application that
does _not_ depend on a specific driver to work, an application that can
access the specific HW directly and test it. I already know how to access
MMIO, the PCI bus and such, but I don't know how to handle interrupts from
userspace.
Suggstions ?!?!

It would be nice, in this case, to have a generic driver in the kernel to
which you could say:
- Register this interrupt for me;
- When this interrupt is called, let me know and I'll handle it and clear 
  the interrupt request;
- (Optional)I'll let you know when I'm done handling it;
This would be great for HW debugging and diagnostics testing (which is
what I'm interested in).
