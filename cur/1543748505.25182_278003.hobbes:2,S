Subject: ACPI and APIC on nforce2 with 2.4 kernel - is there hope?

Is there any hope of seeing the acpi_skip_timer_override patch in the 2.4
branch? It has been in the 2.6 branch since around 2.6.5-rcfoo. This patch
addresses a problem specific to nforce2 motherboards that results in an XT-PIC
timer on ACPI and APIC enabled 2.4.x kernels.
I really don't know how much of a Bad Thing (TM) this is but my anxieties are
due to: 1) The fact that I see clock gain of about one minute per week; 2) The
fact that nforce2 has suffered from notorious instability and I just want to
feel comfort that all known problems are going to get ironed out. I acknowledge
that this problem is: 1) a hardware problem; 2) fixed in the latest stable
branch (as of the 2.6.6 release).
If the answer to my question is no, I would appreciate guidance on: 1) whether
this issue could cause me problems (is it likely to result in clock gain; could
it cause general instability or other problems); 2) what people recommend as a
2.4.x kernel configuration for nforce2 motherboards (mine is Abit NF7-S Rev2)
in terms of ACPI, IOAPIC and LAPIC parameters.
To demonstrate, with an ACPI and APIC enabled 2.4.26 Debianised kernel, I see:
cat /proc/interrupts
           CPU0
  0:    1180749          XT-PIC  timer
  1:       1834    IO-APIC-edge  keyboard
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade

 21:        443   IO-APIC-level  ehci_hcd, NVidia nForce2
 22:          3   IO-APIC-level  ohci1394, usb-ohci
NMI:          0
LOC:    1180732
ERR:          0
MIS:          0
N.B. I understand that the separate issue of the non-availability of IRQ2
because of the spurious reservation by cascade has now been patched, as of
2.4.27-pre2 (and 2.6.6).
