If this is on a IA32(Pentium II or later)/IA64 have you considered using
the processor TSC register to get interval timestamps? It's a lot
lighter weight and should give better resolution. When we have done this
we compared the tick values directly.
To convert TSC ticks to time the /proc/cpuinfo value for 'cpu MHz', see
the glibc get_clockfreq.c and hp_timing.h implementation for details.

Subject: timing an application
Hi,
being inspired by some book about optimizing c++ code i decided to do
timing of functions i wrote. I am using gettimeofday to set
two timeval structs and calculate the time between them.
But the results depend heavily on the load, also i reckon that this
is an innacurate timing.
Any ideas on timing a function, or a block of code? Maybe some kernel
timers or something.
Regards,
Maciej Soltysiak
