Not really.  Firstly, a lot of ATAPI devices report the correct
compliance level and secondly, the consequence of reporting no
compliance (level 0) is that the mid layer will be very careful to use
the most minimal command set it can (the usual consequence of sending a
USB device a command it doesn't understand is to have it crash).
However, this will have no effect for at least CDs:  The sr driver is
only interested in the MMC compliance level not the SCSI compliance
level.

Er, I think you might have a slight misunderstanding of what the mid
layer does with the scsi level.  It doesn't police incoming commands
that are user generated (the user is free to crash the device or set
their house on fire) according to the compliance level.  All it does is
try to make sure that the mid-layer transactions (which are pretty much
inquiry, mode sense and test unit ready) are all as minimal as possible.

The former only, I believe.
