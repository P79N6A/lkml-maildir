   I don't see where this is a problem.  API functions, ie. those that will
   get called from other modules, are broken if they are marked __init. 
   >From what I've seen, converting various modules to use the new
   module_init/exit, there have not been any problems with overzealous
   __init usage.  The problem is generally completely lack of __init{data}
   usage.
   The behavior and logic of __init{data}-related code should be exactly
   the same, whether code is compiled as a module vs. compiled into the
   kernel.
Well, for example, in a set of patches given to me, a structure which is
needed when the driver is loaded/initialized and unloaded was marked as
__initdata.  This was perfectly safe, because compiled-in kernel drivers
are never unloaded, and currently, for modules __initdata is ignored.
If at some point __initdata was honored for modules, then when it came
time to unload the module --- oops!  System crash.
