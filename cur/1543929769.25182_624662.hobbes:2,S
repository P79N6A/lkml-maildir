Subject: [PATCH 14/28] CacheFiles: Be consistent about the use of mapping vs file->f_mapping in Ext3 [try #2]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/5/266

Change all the usages of file->f_mapping in ext3_*write_end() functions to use
the mapping argument directly.  This has two consequences:
 (*) Consistency.  Without this patch sometimes one is used and sometimes the
     other is.
 (*) A NULL file pointer can be passed.  This feature is then made use of by
     the generic hook in the next patch, which is used by CacheFiles to write
     pages to a file without setting up a file struct.
