So, the problem is on the legal side.
But I have to ask - which NDIS driver?  I can write a free NDIS driver
and use it with ndiswrapper.  You can say it's a stupid thing to do, but
once you talk about the legality, the only argument should be
legal/illegal.  Besides, it may be a not such a bad idea for a ReactOS
developer writing a ReactOS driver to test it with Linux.
Also, nothing should prevent me from combining ndiswrapper with any
Windows driver in the privacy of my home as long as I don't distribute
anything.  GPL doesn't have use restrictions (although the driver may
have an EULA).
Since the problem is with USB symbols, I can split the USB part from
ndiswrapper and call it ndiswrapper-usb.  Then ndiswrapper-usb will be
calling the GPL-only symbols while ndiswrapper will be loading the
non-free modules.  Good luck catching that!  It's actually a change that
makes sense technically.  Imagine what a change specifically intended to
fool Linux would do!
I don't see how the kernel can detect the cases where GPL is actually
violated without creating problem for honest users.  Kernel code is not
a police department, let alone a court of law.  Let's not create out own
DRM right in the kernel!
Companies that ship ndiswrapper with non-free modules may be breaking
copyright laws already.  But it's not something that should be fought by
kernel patches.
