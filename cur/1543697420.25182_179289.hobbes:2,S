Hi all...First of all, please excuse me if this is not the right place to post this question. If not
please address me to the correct mailing list and i'll apologize. 
I want to keep track of TCP retransmissions for all TCP connections. I need this to compare 
retransmissions with a new congestion control algorithm i developed for my thesis. 
Is there a place or a way to get values?
Thnx in advance,
Luca
