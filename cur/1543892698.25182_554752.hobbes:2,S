No. I think that anybody who uses that gets whatever he deserves. It's 
designed for one particular usage scenario (where it should work fine), if 
you try to use it for something else across threads, you've already lost.

I think Davide ack'ed your patch, but I also think that one clashes with 
the one I actually ended up applying. If you were to send me the signalfd 
part (tested, preferably), I'd apply it, considering that it seems to be 
the right thign to do, and it already got acked by Davide.
Or did I get confused by some other patches flying around?
(Gaah, there's been _way_ too much patching going on today, I'm not happy 
about how -rc4 seems to not be calming down)
