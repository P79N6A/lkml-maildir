We don't care about AMD systems for this problem because they
don't use swiotlb in normal operations, but the AGP remapping hardware (except 
on one particulr chipset, but people don't build servers from that) 
If anything then testing results from Summit3 based Intel x86 NUMA systems 
would be interesting.
