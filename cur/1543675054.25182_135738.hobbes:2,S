then you are hitting a different bug or a bug related to the issues Christian 
Klose and me and $tons of others were complaining.
The bug you are hitting might be the problem with "process stuck in D state" 
Andrea Arcangeli fixed, let me guess, over half a year ago or so.
In case you have a good mind to try to address your issue, you might want to 
try out the patch you can find here:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.21rc2aa1/9980_fix-pausing-2
ALL: Anyone who has this kind of pauses/stops/mouse is dead/keyboard is dead/:
     speak _NOW_ please, doesn't matter who you are!
I've added Andrea into CC.
ciao, Marc
