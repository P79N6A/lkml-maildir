Well, today I tried the same VIA motherboard (EN12000) with a Morex 2788
case and their dual PCI riser card does have a working interrupt on the
upper slot. lspci is below. I can use the lower slot later, when the
harddisk is not blocking the space for the PCI-card there.
I use a 2.6.20.1 kernel with SAA7146_USE_I2C_IRQ for budget-av.c. In the
old situation I was forced to use SAA7146_I2C_SHORT_DELAY even though
the upper slot had the same DN and same IRQ given by Linux.
Thanks a lot for all the comments and feedback!
Thanks to Morex for having a working PCI riser card!
