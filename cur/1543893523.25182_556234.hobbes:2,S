Hi Fengguang,
I found these variables a little confusing.  la_index is the last offset
passed to ondemand_readahead, so perhaps "last_request_start" is a
better name?  The comment "enqueue time" seems strange, too.
ra_index seems ok, although "readahead_start" might be better.  Perhaps
readahead_index should be expressed as readahead_size, which is how it
seems to be used.  Perhaps "lookahead_index" is best expressed as a
buffer at the end of the readahead zone (readahead_min?).
ie:
	pgoff_t last_request_start;     /* start of req which triggered readahead */
	pgoff_t readahead_start;        /* Where readahead started */
	pgoff_t readahead_size;         /* PAGE_CACHE_SIZE units of readahead */
	pgoff_t readahead_min;          /* readahead_size left before we recalc */
This gets rid of many of the accessors, I think, and avoids introducing
a new term to understand (lookahead).

These are only called in one place, so I think it's clearer to do this
there directly.  But I see you exported ra_submit, too, even though it's
only used in the same file.  Are there plans for other users?
Thanks,
Rusty.
