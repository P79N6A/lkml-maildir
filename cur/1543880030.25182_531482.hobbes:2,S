I had a quick look at Ingo's code yesterday. Ingo is always smart to 
prepare a main dish (feature) with a nice sider (code cleanup) to Linus ;)
And even this code does that pretty nicely. The deadline designs looks 
good, although I think the final "key" calculation code will end up quite 
different from what it looks now.
I would suggest to thoroughly test all your alternatives before deciding. 
Some code and design may look very good and small at the beginning, but 
when you start patching it to cover all the dark spots, you effectively 
end up with another thing (in both design and code footprint).
About O(1), I never thought it was a must (besides a good marketing 
material), and O(log(N)) *may* be just fine (to be verified, of course).
