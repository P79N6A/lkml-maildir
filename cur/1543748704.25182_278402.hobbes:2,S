Subject: [PATCH] Hotplug support for several PSX controlers

Hello,
Since 2.6.9, several PSX controlers in the same time can be supported. 
However, because of a bug, if not all the PSX controlers are pluged in 
then nothing works. Typically, you load gamecon with options saying that 
you have two PSX adapter ports and then you plug and unplug has many 
controllers has you want. There is a bug which prevent keypress to be 
detected when not all the controllers connected.
The problem was that when a port didn't have a controler pluged the 
packet length to receive was read as very big, leading to a kind of 
buffer overflow. This patch checks the packet length and if it is bigger 
than the theoritical possible it considers that there is no controller 
pluged on this port.
It probably works on a vanilla 2.6.10-rc3 but I highly recommand to use 
the Vojtech's tree which contains an important fix about PSX DDR (cf 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=110118014804716&w=2).
I've heard that Linus wants 2.6.10 ready for Christmas, this patch 
should definitetly helps ;-)
