Arr, this time it just locked silently. sys-rq keysd were still available
but didn't produce any console output (sys-rq-b still rebooted the machine
though :))
I suppose this doesn't relly make sense w/o a serial console. I will get a
second machine on next friday. Then i can hopefully provide more useful info
than "he my machine locked up"..
