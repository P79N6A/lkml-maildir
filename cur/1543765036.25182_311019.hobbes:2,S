I meant something like this:
[patch 000/100]  Foo-ize the baz.
   [patch 001/100] Frob the baz
   [patch 002/100] baz cleanups
   [patch 003/100] apply foo-ization to baz
Rather than
[patch 000/100] Foo-ize the baz.
   [patch 001/100] Frob the baz
     [patch 002/100] baz cleanups
       [patch 003/100] apply foo-ization to baz
Which would (as you rightly pointed out) be ludicrous.
i.e., all the patches are replys to the summary.
