Actually we do so in some places of the existing FireWire drivers.
Didn't go wrong so far. :-)

That's right; there are a few in-kernel features and, much more
importantly, userspace ABIs missing before Kristian's stack could
replace the old one.
The good news is that the ABIs are either hidden behind userspace
libraries or are deprecated and to be phased out next year anyway.
The bad news is that the old stack is internally not as cleanly modular
as it was initially targeted to be. This makes it difficult to replace
the stack in parts, particularly where isochronous protocols are
concerned. Maybe this becomes a non-issue once the old ABIs were
removed; although I suppose that Kristian would like to see his stack in
wider use much earlier than that. The asynchronous stuff (what's left of
it besides sbp2) should be easy to move over.
