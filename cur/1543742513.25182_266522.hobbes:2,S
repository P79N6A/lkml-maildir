Linus, there is no way in hell that you are going to move
a value from memory into a register (pop ecx) faster than
you are going to do anything to the stack-pointer or
any other register. The register operations operate
at the internal CPU clock-rate (GHz). The memory operations
operate at the front-side bus rate (MHz), and the data-
movement must actually occur before anything else can.
In other words, with stack operations, modern CPUs will
stall until the operation has completed.
Using the rdtsc, on this computer, both of the stack-pointer
additions (leal or add) take 6 +/- 2 clocks. The pop ecx
takes 12 +/- 3 clocks.
Things that should take only one clock, according to the
documentation, take 4 or 5 even when subtracting-out
the time necessary to do the rdtsc, because this machine
(and probably others) is very noisy, so all I can state
with certainty is that the pop from the stack takes longer.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
