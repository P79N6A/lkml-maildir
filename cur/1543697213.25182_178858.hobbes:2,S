Because the translation process is hugely CPU intensive.  It takes
something like 6 hours to do the 2.5 tree on 2.2Ghz Athlon with a gig
of ram.  And it uses every bit of that ram, that's my desktop machine
and _everything_ is paged out when I come in in the morning.
I agreed to the BK2CVS stuff as a way of ensuring that people had the
data in a format that they could use without BK and was useful.  I'm
willing to do that for each main tree of each major project (i.e., if
XFree86 or something like that moved to BK we'd agree to do the CVS
conversion so that there was no lockin).
But doing it for every branch of every tree is nuts unless you are 
donating a 16 way with a zillion gigs of ram.  And a zillion disk
arms, this thrashes the heck out of the disk.

Yeah, and I'd like all the open source developers of the world to acknowledge
that I'm a good guy and I'm trying to help.  In writing, of course ;)
