This is becoming a FAQ.
Go to 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/axboe/patches
and get the newest Jens Axboe's loopback fs patch (seems to be
2.4.1-pre10/loop-3.bz2 atm, though I thought Jens was going to release
loop-4 sortly.)
See if the problem goes away with it.
I'm not sure if Alan has any plans to merge this to ac-series. It would
appear a worthy candidate...
