Oh, right.  Xenix.  I'd forgotten.

You mean trivial changes to understand the ELF magic number for a
riscoid-ABI x86 object.  (You wouldn't lie to the linker and call them
SysV objects, now, would you?)  Also gdb and libbfd need to know about
stack frames.  Admittedly none of this is strictly necessary just to
link and boot a kernel.
