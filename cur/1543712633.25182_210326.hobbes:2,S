Sure, and I most certainly haven't read your future code well enough.
Your present implementation, one vma per page (in that real case where
vmas are properly merged by mainline or anonmm), is far from perfect.
anon_vma has surprised me more than once by working smoothly just
where I thought it must go wrong.  Please do surprise me again:
write that code and post the patch which resolves this doubt.
Thanks,
Hugh
