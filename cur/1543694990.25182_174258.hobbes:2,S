I see what you mean.  Thanks for spotting and fixing this.
I've run into a problem in testing.  For some reason, I've started to get
ide timeouts, and the error recovery is not working correctly, due to a
problem in the driver.
In sgiioc4_ide_dma_stop(), sgiioc4_ide_dma_end(), and sgiioc4_clearirq(),
there are calls to xide_delay(), which uses schedule_timeout() to sleep.
Since all of these sgiioc4_ functions can be called from interrupt context,
that's an obvious problem.
In sgiioc4_clearirq(), the delay function is while we're waiting for the
interrupt to clear.
In sgiioc4_ide_dma_stop(), we're waiting for the DMA bit to clear.
In sgiioc4_ide_dma_end(), we're waiting for another DMA to finish.
I believe that the right answer is to use udelay() and give up after
a short period of time.  My question is what does the ide layer
expect?  That is, if you call the dma_end function and the hardware
driver can't succeed, what would you like us to do?  Is there a way
to return error, or should we just fail and the ide infrastructure
will pick it up later and reset things?
I am new to Linux IDE, so forgive these questions if the answers should
be obvious.
thanks
