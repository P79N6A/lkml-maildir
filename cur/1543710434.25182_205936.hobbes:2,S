At mremap time, you don't change the page->index at all,
but only the vm_start/vm_end.  Think of it as an mm_struct
pointing to a struct address_space with its anonymous
memory.  On exec() the mm_struct gets a new address_space,
on fork parent and child share them.
Sharing is good enough, because there is PAGE_SIZE times
more space in a struct address_space than there's available
virtual memory in one single process.  That means that for
a daemon like apache every child can simply get its own 4GB
subset of the address space for any new VMAs, while mapping
the inherited VMAs in the same way any other file is mapped.

There's no difference between mremap() of anonymous memory
and mremap() of part of an mmap() range of a file...
At least, there doesn't need to be.
