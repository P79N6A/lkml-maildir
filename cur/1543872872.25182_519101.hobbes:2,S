No, it's not hardcoded. I know it looks confusing. struct i2c_adapter
has a timeout field, that's the one being set to 100 in i2c-algo-bit,
but i2c-algo-bit uses the i2c_algo_bit_data timeout field. The
i2c_adapter timeout field is unused.
This is clearly calling for a cleanup but I don't have time for this
right now.
