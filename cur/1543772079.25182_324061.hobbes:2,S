Lukas,
You can download the N210/N110 (ver 2.1.1) from the Chelsio website and use that driver for the T110 with a newer kernel. I have tested that driver up to the 2.6.11 kernel release. It will provide you NIC mode functinoality on your T110 TOE card, you can use it as a module, or try to patch it into a later kernel. If patching it into a kernel, you may need to modify the patch a bit.
-Scott

Thanks, we have an account. But I wonder whether T110 card could be used in
newer kernel (as 2.6.6 is rather old and cat /proc/iomap segfaults in kernel).
We do not need TOE functionality, UDP transfer is just fine.
