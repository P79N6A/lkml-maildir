Argh, died again!! It had been stable for over 12 days. Same error
message, and the root md is degraded and dirty just like last time.
This is a very severe state with high risk of data loss. When things
went sour, terminals and most applications still kept working, but
anything that touched the filesystem froze up. I had a shell open in a
chroot on a ramdisk, but dmesg just hung for a few minutes and then
exited with a "Bus error". I had no other way of examining the kernel
log since the machine runs X.
This was running 2.6.15-rc4. Crashes seem to happen less frequently
with it than with 2.6.14.x, but when they happen they leave the RAID
in a severe state. I also don't think 2.6.14.2 said anything about
disabling the IRQ.
I'm very desperate now. About every week I experience a crash that
damages my RAID array to the point where it can't boot, as if the
instability wasn't bad enough. Do I need to buy a hardware RAID card?
