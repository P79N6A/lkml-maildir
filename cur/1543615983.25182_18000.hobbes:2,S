Right, the directory structure is mostly informative only, because it is
possible to get parts from single directories. For example: ALS4000 driver
uses pci/als4000.c and isa/sb/sb_common.c code. Both source files are
used for compilation. We can optimize Makefiles further for an exact
specification of such hardware cross-references and reduce directory
passes when cross-references are not active.
If you look to the Makefiles, there is (for ALS4000):
linux/sound/isa/sb/Makefile:
obj-$(CONFIG_SND_ALS4000) += snd-sb-common.o
linux/sound/pci/Makefile:
obj-$(CONFIG_SND_ALS4000) += snd-als4000.o
If something does not fit: we can create a new subdirectory.
