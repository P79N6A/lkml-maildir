Just recognized my backup notebook, a Pentium III / Intel 440-BX-AGPset 
does the same thing -- the pmtmr readings are always quite close to each 
other, but not linear.
However, overall the PM timer _does_ the right thing all the time [it always
did the right thing on that system, as that's where the original patch was
created....]
