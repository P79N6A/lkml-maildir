But if you do that you should really use a separate function that 
can use cache bypassing stores. 
Normal clear_page cannot use that because it would be a loss
when the data is soon used.
So the two changes don't really make sense.
Also I must say I'm still suspicious regarding your heuristic
to trigger gang faulting - with bad luck it could lead to a lot 
more memory usage to specific applications that do very sparse
usage of memory. 
There should be at least an madvise flag to turn it off and a sysctl 
and it would be better to trigger only on a longer sequence of 
consecutive faulted pages.

How about some numbers on i386?
