I'm not sure if this is the right place to propose such a thing, but I 
think it would be very valuable to have a standardized user-side library 
to accompany this addition to the kernel.
In particular, as a starting place for the discussion, I'd like to see 
functions in it that are very similar to a subset of what is currently 
in libpfm.  Specifically, I'd like to see the following functions (with 
the names changed to pcl_* perhaps):
extern pfm_err_t pfm_find_event(const char *str, unsigned int *idx);
extern pfm_err_t pfm_find_event_bycode(int code, unsigned int *idx);
extern pfm_err_t pfm_find_event_bycode_next(int code, unsigned int start,
                                             unsigned int *next);
extern pfm_err_t pfm_find_event_mask(unsigned int event_idx, const char 
*str,
                                      unsigned int *mask_idx);
extern pfm_err_t pfm_find_full_event(const char *str, pfmlib_event_t *e);
extern pfm_err_t pfm_get_max_event_name_len(size_t *len);
extern pfm_err_t pfm_get_num_events(unsigned int *count);
extern pfm_err_t pfm_get_num_event_masks(unsigned int event_idx,
                                          unsigned int *count);
extern pfm_err_t pfm_get_event_name(unsigned int idx, char *name,
                                     size_t maxlen);
extern pfm_err_t pfm_get_full_event_name(pfmlib_event_t *e, char *name,
                                          size_t maxlen);
extern pfm_err_t pfm_get_event_code(unsigned int idx, int *code);
extern pfm_err_t pfm_get_event_mask_code(unsigned int idx,
                                          unsigned int mask_idx,
                                          unsigned int *code);
extern pfm_err_t pfm_get_event_description(unsigned int idx, char **str);
extern pfm_err_t pfm_get_event_code_counter(unsigned int idx, unsigned 
int cnt,
                                             int *code);
extern pfm_err_t pfm_get_event_mask_name(unsigned int event_idx,
                                          unsigned int mask_idx,
                                          char *name, size_t maxlen);
extern pfm_err_t pfm_get_event_mask_description(unsigned int event_idx,
                                                 unsigned int mask_idx,
                                                 char **desc);
Now, since it's not clear right now how unit masks are going to be 
handled in your proposal, I'm not sure the that *_event_mask_* functions 
are applicable, but I think something that fills that function will be 
needed.
Architectures that have need for additional functionality should be free 
to add arch-specific functions.
Full descriptions of these functions can be found in the man pages of 
the libpfm documentation.
Any thoughts on this?  Do you already have a user library structure in mind?
