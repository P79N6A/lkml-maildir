What about the scenario where both spellings are used in  a header 
someplace that winds up being a systemwide reference?  I don't know 
that it has been, but such a 'correction' has the potential to take 
us back to square one and 1993.  I have had recurring daytime 
nightmares of such possibilities since this subject came up the first 
time a week or so ago.
Methinks the proponent here should find another, more productive 
outlet for his frustrations.  This particular dog won't hunt.
