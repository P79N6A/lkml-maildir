	Personally I do as much as possible that way.  Very rarely do I
have problems too, esp when I'm using SCSI devices.  The *point* is to
be able to do everything needed to keep the machine running while it's
up and serving users.  With Unix in general this is possible.

	So there are some things that you can't flash.  I'm certainly not
saying you can flash everything in the system, I'm saying we shouldn't limit
ourselves or Linux without good cause.  The concern that someone *as root*
might be able to damage something certainly isn't a very good reason to
limit ourselves in such a manner.  Esp. not when it adds code to the kernel
which has no other redeeming value.

	If the upgrade fails you have to replace the NIC, but that can be
done later, you don't have to immediately reboot the machine, and it can be
planned for downtime.
