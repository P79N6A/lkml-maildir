Hi. After taking a nice vacation for the last week or so, I have another
update for the Linux 32-bit UID support patches.
This patch includes yet more IPC changes. (more on this in my next email)
It is tested and working on the i386 architecture.
The patches are available at:
http://www.engin.umich.edu/caen/systems/Linux/code/misc/2.3/19991130/
Changes in this version:
	- there is now a separation between the "user ABI" for
	  msgctl(), semctl(), and shmctl(), and the actual kernel data
	  structures. This makes it easier and cleaner to support both the
	  "old ABI" as well as the new one for 32-bit UIDs
	- minor cleanups to the architecture-independent code (getgroups()
	  and setgroups() do only one copy_{to,from}_user instead of one
	  copy per group)
In order to use 32-bit UIDs you need the following patches from the above
URL:
	linux-acct.patch
	linux-arch-independ.patch
	linux-ext2.patch
	linux-ipc.patch
	linux-filesystems.patch
as well as a patch for your particular architecture:
	linux-alpha.patch
	linux-arm.patch
	linux-i386.patch
	linux-m68k.patch
	linux-mips.patch
	linux-ppc.patch
	linux-sh.patch
	linux-sparc.patch
	linux-sparc64.patch
Still known to be broken with these patches:
	- sparc64 architecture.
Still untested:
	- all non-i386 architectures
Thanks,
Chris Wing
