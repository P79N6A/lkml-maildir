Right.

The one that I used in a previous life was like so.  No "while"
or "for" constructs, only "do thisloop forever" with conditionals
all being explicitly coded inside the loop(s).  All based on:
  do [loopname] [forever];
    {block};
  end [loopname];
with {block} possibly containing "undo [loopname]".
An unnamed undo just terminates the innermost loop.
Named undo's can be used to terminate any loop level.
