Not really.  For nfs3, they appear to be per *user*, just accessed in
a funny way.  nfs4 looks a little more complicated, but in the end,
all data is either accessable by other means or used for locking.
Does locking work on NFS now?  If not, that can go as well.
Looks like I will keep this patch for a while and see what Linus
thinks when 2.7 opens up.
