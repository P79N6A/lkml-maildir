-mm6 only had part 1; you also have part 2 now which should fix this one

that'd be a bug in the tty layer; the VC shouldn't be allowed to go away
until the sysfs file is gone (basic sysfs refcounting rules), and any
person keeping such a file open can delay that.
Now I can believe the tty layer having, ehm, suboptimal
refcounting/locking; I believe Alan is still trying to get it sane....
