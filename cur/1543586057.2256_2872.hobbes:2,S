<shrug> If you run untrusted binaries - you are screwed.  If you run
them as root - all users on your system are screwed.  If your MUA
(or browser, etc.) can run untrusted code - see above.  If you have
a dual-boot system and one of the OSes is compromised - all of them
are.  Nothing to do about that.  What's new here?  Don't be an idiot 
nd don't use crapware...
