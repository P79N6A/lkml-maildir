Messages start to BOUNCE with that only after the condition
has been active for 5 consequtive days.
(Standards define 3 days queue wait time minimum.)
If your email server has a temporary glitch and it does
decide to report to remotes that "421 I am broken, try latter"
that is fine AS LONG AS it gets fixed within 3 days.
If the condition persists for 5 days, we do remove all
subscribers at given domain AND the accumulated queue
to them without any further messages to anybody.
(They are not receiving the messages, so there is no way to
notify them in forecastable future.)
Do you have any idea of how many messages are in the queue
at that time directed to recipients not receiving them ?
Depending on the week: 1300 - 2000 !
