I use a 'struct device_ethernet_data' in my MPC85xx platform-device
patches at 
http://www.evillabs.net/~gus/patches
That seems to work well, and we could move it from
include/asm-ppc/device-ethernet.h to include/linux/device-ethernet.h to
make it more arch-independant. That covers MAC addrs and phy locations.
As for PHY IRQ, that's a thornier issue. For now, I put that in the
ethernet device's resource list.
