	Hi Linus,
	I like to keep your tree and Alan's tree in sync, so would you
mind applying this patch to your kernel.
	It contains :
	o Define wireless device private ioctl range to avoid name
space collisions with stuff like 'mii-tools'. This is something I've
done at the rerquest of David Miller, and I would like this in so that
the various wireless driver can make the transitions early in 2.5.X.
	o Various benign update the wireless statistics to be more
802.11 compliant.
	I've regenerated this patch against 2.4.12 and fixed a
spelling mistake.
	Thanks in advance...
	Jean
