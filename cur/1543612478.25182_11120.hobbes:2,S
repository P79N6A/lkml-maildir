Sure, but you are assuming one file system, which is global.  That's
certainly one way to do it, but not the only way, and not the way that
I've suggested.  I'm not sure if you remember this, but I always advocated
partially shared and partially private.  /, for example, is private.
In fact, so is /proc, /tmp, and /dev.  There are /gproc, /gtmp, and /gdev
which are in the global namespace and do for the cluster what /<xxx>
does for a regular machine.
We can go around and around on this and the end result will be that I will
have narrowed the locking problem down to the point that only the processes
which are actually using the resource have to participate in the locking.
In a traditional SMP OS, all processes have to participate.
