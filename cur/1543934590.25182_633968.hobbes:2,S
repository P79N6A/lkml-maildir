Hello all,
The following two patches updates isp1301_omap.c to new-style i2c driver.
The patches are against curent linux mailine head.
Tony Lindgren (Cc'ed here) already has a working version of this driver
on his linux-omap git tree (see [1] and [2]), these are just a rework for
them to apply cleanly on mainline.
The patches were compile tested with omap_h2_1610_defconfig with isp1301
enabled.
