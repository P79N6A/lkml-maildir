Sure, no argument there.

My post was motivated by two observations:
1. Alan Cox complains occasionally that Linus' trees are not well tested,
   and can't survive the torture tests that the ac tree goes through before
   release.  (e.g.
"2.4.8-ac12
        I'm trying to make sure I can keep this testable
        as 2.4.9 vanilla isnt being stable on my test sets "
2. The STP at OSDLab seems like a great resource that we might be able
to leverage to solve the problem Alan points out.
I'm not suggesting anyone do any less testing.  Just the opposite;
if we set things up properly with the STP, we might be able to run
many more tests before each final release.
