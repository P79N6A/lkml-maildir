Last 2.6 kernel run was 2.6.7, which didn't have any problem with irq18. 
I'm going to gather the full set of data on acpi= and pci= options, but 
I'm nominally on vacation and spending time with the family instead of 
computers. Also, I can't use my Christmas present until I get the FC1 
kernel to set the i810/ac97 audio to 4 channels instead of the default 
two, so all the people saying "I want to hear it" can't be satisfied.
Priorities this week...
