As I say, broken mincore() on nonlinear mappings isn't a showstopper ;)

If we want to bother with the traditional truncate-causes-SIGBUS semantics
on nonlinear mappings, yes.  I guess it would be best to do that if
possible.

Yes, malicious apps can DoS the machine in many ways.  I'm more concerned
about non-malicious ones getting hurt by the new search activity.  Say, a
single-threaded app which uses a huge number of vma's to map discontiguous
parts of a file.  The 2.4-style virtual scan would handle that OK, and the
2.6-style pte_chain walk would handle it OK too.  People do weird things.
(objrmap could perhaps terminate the vma walk after it sees the page->count
fall to a value which means there are no more pte's mapping the page - that
would halve the search cost on average).
