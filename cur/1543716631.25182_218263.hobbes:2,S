Actually I'm expecting to use the first option (hook) in the
current code of the board hotplug :)
The board hotplug is supposed to support "board attachment and
detachment".  That requires hardware manipulation.  So, the
hotplug code (at least, a part of the code) needs to live in
the kernel space.  Anyway, I would finish the first rough patches
in a few days and post them.  Please take a look at them to see
what I'm trying to do.
Thank you,
Kei
