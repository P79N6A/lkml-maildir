There are SLUB patches pending (not in rc7-mm2 as far as I can recall) 
that reduce the default page order sizes to head off this issue. The 
defaults were initially too large (and they still default to large
for testing if Mel's Antifrag work is detected to be active).

__GFP_REPEAT is unusual here but this was carried over from the 
kmem_cache_alloc it seems. Hmm... There is some variance on how we do this 
between arches. Should we uniformly set or not set this flag?
