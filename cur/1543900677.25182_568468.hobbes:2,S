That's usually not the place where idiots screw up.  It's stuff like
loading an initrd that doesn't do LVM, and your / is on an LVM partition,
or going from a kernel that used the IDE drivers to one that uses libata,
and forgetting to fix /etc/fstab for the /dev/hd -> /dev/sd change, or ...
You get the idea.  At some point, you have to insist that the user's clue
must be  ----> THIS TALL in order to build their own kernel rather than going
with what the distro installed.
