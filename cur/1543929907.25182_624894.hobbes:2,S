They are, but the context in which they apply is vague.
I can equally generate examples where the non-blocking behavior you
are a proponent of would break non-blocking UDP apps during a
sendmsg() call when we hit IPSEC resolution.  Yet similar language on
blocking semantics exists for sendmsg() in the standards.
The world is shades of gray, implying anything else is foolhardy and
that's how I'm handling this.

I use IPSEC every single day in this fashion, and I haven't.
