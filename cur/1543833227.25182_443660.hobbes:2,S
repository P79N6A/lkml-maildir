This is a quite questionable theory and a narrow minded perspective.
Saying companies that write binary drivers for Linux don't give back
anything is not factual - they offer many people a possibility to use
Linux where in the absence of those drivers they would have been
forced to use something else, 100% proprietary. In short they offer
Linux a percentage of its user base. Reducing possibilities is never a
good idea  - especially when it comes to users, it does hurt them as
much as it hurts you to see a EXPORT_SYMBOL without a GPL in it - and
there is no reason why it isn't ok to hurt you but the users can be
hurt freely.  If it was so impossible and questionable to write binary
drivers, they all would have been disappeared by now. They are still
out there, people use them.

Yeah whatever, my real name is not as important as the topic at hand.
That's just your personal opinion/logic to translate/label it as a
troll.
And I do apologize for saying Dimwits.
