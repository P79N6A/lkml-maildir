Subject: [RFC/PATCH 9/17][Kdump] Kconfig for kdump
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/3/28/69

o config option CONFIG_CRASH_DUMP
o Made it dependent on HIGHMEM. This is required as capture kernel treats the
  previous kernel's memory as high memmory and stitches a PTE for accessing
  it.
