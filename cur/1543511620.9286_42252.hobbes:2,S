Not quite.  The userspace NFS server used to do this, but it has a
security flaw.  While the NFS server is servicing a user request, it can
be killed by the user.  This caused a new system-call variant to be added,
setfsuid(), that would only affect the UID for file accesses.
Samba could use this approach as well, but it would only work on Linux.
