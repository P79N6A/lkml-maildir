Oh no, it's great for regular device driver work. I used this
type of system all the time on a different PowerPC OS.
Suppose you need to set up a piece of hardware. Assume that the
hardware isn't across some nasty bridge. You do this:
hw->x = 42;
hw->y = 19;
eieio();
hw->p = 11;
hw->q = 233;
hw->r = 87;
eieio()
hw->n = 101;
hw->m = 5;
eieio()
In that ficticious example, I get 7 writes to the hardware device
with only 3 "eieio" operations. It's not hard at all. Sometimes
a "sync" is used instead, also explicitly.
To get even more speed, you can mark memory as non-coherent.
You can even do this for RAM. There are cache control instructions
to take care of any problems; simply ask the CPU to write things
out as needed.
Linux should probably do this:
Plain stuff is like x86. If you want the performance of loose
ordering, ask for it when you get the mapping and use read/write
functions that have a "_" prefix. If you mix the "_" versions
with a plain x86-like mapping or the other way, the behavior you
get will be an arch-specific middle ground.
