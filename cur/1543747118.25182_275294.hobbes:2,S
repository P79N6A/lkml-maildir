ah, I was looking at a 2.6.9 tree, my apologies.
but..
    if (mtrr) {
        int temp_size = size_total;
        /* Find the largest power-of-two */
        while (temp_size & (temp_size - 1))
                    temp_size &= (temp_size - 1);
                /* Try and find a power of two to add */
        while (temp_size && mtrr_add(vesafb_fix.smem_start, temp_size, MTRR_TYPE_WRCOMB, 1)==-EINVAL) {
            temp_size >>= 1;
        }
    }
size_total is calculated thus:
    size_total = screen_info.lfb_size * 65536;
    if (vram_total)
        size_total = vram_total * 1024 * 1024;
    if (size_total < size_vmode)
        size_total = size_vmode;
where is screen_info.lfb_size set ?

or blacklist if there aren't too many perhaps?
