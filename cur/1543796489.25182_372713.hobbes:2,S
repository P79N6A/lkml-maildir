no distro gives 5 years of support for a kernel done every 6 months;
they start such projects more like every 18 to 24 months (SuSE used to
do it a bit more frequently but it seems they also slowed this down).

"except for" is a slipperly slope. And "except for bugfixes" would be
wrong... those would be the ones that need to be in the kernel.org
kernel. As well as new hardware support. At which point.. what is the
difference? Where do 'features' stop and where do 'only needed bugfixes'
begin?

that's not practical though. And it's still no better from the
regression point of view; those enterprise kernels undergo quite a bit
of churn as well, but just very directed churn to the point that I doubt
it would satisfy your target audience....
