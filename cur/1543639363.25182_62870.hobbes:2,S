The statistics are against you. rmap won't help at all with all the other 
kernel allocations, and the dcache/icache is often large, and on big 
machines while there may be tens of thousands of idle entries, there will 
also be hundreds of _non_idle entries that you can't just remove.

.. at which poin tyou then get zone balancing problems.
Or we end up with the same kind of special zone that we have _anyway_ in
the current large-page patch, in which case the point of doing this is
what?
