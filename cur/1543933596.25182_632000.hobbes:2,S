No, as documented. 'KVMKVMKVM' is spread among all three registers (9 
bytes won't fit into one...)

rax is used here in the sense of 'rax on x86-64, eax on i386'.  I guess 
this should be documented.

Hm.  Since hypercall numbers are shared with i386, we can't have >4G of 
them.  So the hypercall number should be redefined to be in eax, 
regardless of arch (while the arguments still are unsigned longs).

Or maybe direct 32-bit compares, and document the 32-bit values of the 
registers directly, to avoid any chance of confusion.
Thanks for the comments, I'll update the patches.
