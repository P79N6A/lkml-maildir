And that's precisely what we do. SWSUSP runs before any file system is
mounted. It checks the designed partition's swap header, loads the image
and then completely replaces the booting kernel with the saved one.
That's how we avoid corruption at the moment. But if we have a swapfile,
we need to do some initialisation of the filesystem code in order to get
access to our swapfile. Even if we record in the swapfile - while
suspending - information that gives us the locations of blocks, we still
need to find the start of the swapfile, or store it somewhere. If you
have a suggestion in that regard, I might be able to see a swapfile as a
possibility.
