Sorry, I'm being obtuse. What I had in mind here was:
(1) there's been a longstanding bug where the MPC table entries with
	the IO-APIC ID's gets zeroed out
(2) this bug mysteriously went away, even though we never tracked it down
(3) bugs that smell of mem_map getting stomped on are cropping up
... and I suspect these three things are related, e.g. the MPC stuff moved
or link order changed or some such Heisenbug-ish nonsense and now it's
hitting something else. The NR_CPUS bit isn't even bootable (the panic()
happens before console_init() IIRC) so it's not quite that one. =)
Cheers,
Bill
