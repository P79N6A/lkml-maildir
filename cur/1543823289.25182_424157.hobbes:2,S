Yes it's only designed to detect something that has been asleep for an 
arbitrary long time and "categorised as idle"; it is not supposed to be a 
priority stepping stone for everything, in this case at MAX_BONUS-1. Mike 
proposed doing this instead, but it was never my intent. Your comment is not 
quite correct as it just happens to be MAX_BONUS-1 at nice 0, and not any 
other nice value.

Feel free to update it to how you understand it now :) I have this feeling 
we'll be seeing quite some action here soon...
