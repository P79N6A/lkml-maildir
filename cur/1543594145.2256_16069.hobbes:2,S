hey, the KJP needs volunteers to tackle this bug/cleanup list:
http://bazar.conectiva.com.br/~acme/TODO
More info available at 
http://kernel-janitor.sourceforge.net/,
 the Stanford
Checker also found bugs that have to be fixed (link provided in the KJP
page), please help.
As for what I want to get rid of? Bugs, getting rid of those would be
excellent ;)

           death penalty if Daniel was the judge ;) )
