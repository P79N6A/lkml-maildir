I am not even considering it now. I was considering what the kernel should
do after a:
	kill(SIGSTOP);
	kill(SIGCONT);
Richard was talking about what happens after a _signal_ and not after a
ptrace_continue. These are two different things and we can make them
behave in completly different way inside the kernel. I don't think you
should compare the SIGSTOP+SIGCONG with SIGSTOP+PTRACE_CONTINUE.

I think we should make difference between ^Z and gdb. The signal code is
filled by ugly special cases exactly because they are different things
AFIK.
Do you agree that ^Z is just correct returning -EINTR immediatly at
SIGCONT time (aka `fg` time)?
Should we make PTRACE_CONTINUE to force nanosleep to continue (unlike the
SIGCONT case?)? BTW, I am not sure if nanosleep is the only place that you
may like to change in this respect...
