I have a music play program (freeamp) playing MP3's running.  It has the
feature in that it scans to see if a CD is in the drive and tries to look it up
in CDDB.  Well, I don't have a CD in the drive -- I have a DVD-ROM with UDF file
system on it.  Freeamp doesn't complain, but in my syslog/warnings file, every 5 seconds
I get:
Mar  5 09:17:00 xena kernel: hdc: packet command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
Mar  5 09:17:00 xena kernel: hdc: packet command error: error=0x50
Mar  5 09:17:00 xena kernel: ATAPI device hdc:
Mar  5 09:17:00 xena kernel:   Error: Illegal request -- (Sense key=0x05)
Mar  5 09:17:00 xena kernel:   Cannot read medium - incompatible format -- (asc=0x30, ascq=0x02)
Mar  5 09:17:00 xena kernel:   The failed "Read Subchannel" packet command was:
Mar  5 09:17:00 xena kernel:   "42 02 40 01 00 00 00 00 10 00 00 00 "
----
Needless to say, this fills up messages/warnings fairly quickly.  If there's no
DVD in the drive or if there is a CD in the drive, I don't notice this problem.
Seems like a undesirable feature for the kernel to write out 7-line error messages
everytime a program polls for a CD and fails.  Is there a way to disable this when I
have a DVD ROM disk in the drive? (vanilla 2.4.2 kernel).
Thanks...
