I see some problems with this immediately.  Firstly, as a result of
this change the sample code in include/asm-generic/hw_breakpoint.h is
now incorrect.  You need to change the comments when you change the
code.
Second, your arch_store_info() routine is broken.  It checks for a
kernel symbol name even if when a userspace breakpoint is being
registered.  You should move that check up into validate_settings().
As a related matter, why did you put the "name" field into the
arch-dependent part?  Clearly it should be arch-independent.
