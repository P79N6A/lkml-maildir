Tejun,
I tracked this change down to your patch: 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=115012763500002&r=1&w=2 (approximately). 
(Interestingly, Jeff submitted the respective cumulative libata patch last 
year on my birthday:-( ) Also, there's a Ubuntu bug report: 
https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/
+source/linux-source-2.6.20/+bug/76431 
identical to what I see, although I cannot check if it worked before 
2.6.20. Could you, please, comment how is this supposed to work? In 
particular, what shoud trigger the EH action, leading to setting the 
ATA_DFLAG_SUSPENDED flag? Below again my earlier post for reference.
Thanks
Guennadi
