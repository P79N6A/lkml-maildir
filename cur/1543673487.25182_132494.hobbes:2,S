If the PAG was implemented well, then even the Kerberos credentials
could be contained within the PAG, or accessible only by other processes
in the same PAG. 
One way to think of the PAG is a way of getting around the limited
capabilities of UNIX to have only a UID which is only locally unique. 
The PAG identifies the user globally, and stores credentials to use
to prove it to other systems of file systems. 
Linus said in two previous note:

This may well be true, but current UNIX file systems continue to use the
simple UID and GID for access. Maybe there something that can be done
here as well.
