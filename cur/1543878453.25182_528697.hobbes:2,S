I heard it and accepted that claim without checking it.  Might have been
a mistake.  But the claim came from an NFS developer, which may explain
a thing or two.
NFS clients have to deal with a server rebooting underneith them and
should still behave as expected.  An "rm -r" running on the client
concurrently to a rebooting server is a problem indeed and could be
solved with seekdir/telldir.
That surely doesn't make life any easier for filesystem developers, I
agree.  From that point of view, all telldir cookies should end their
life at closedir time.  For "rm -r" it would be sufficient if the nfs
client simply didn't seekdir at all.  For "ls -lR", this would return
duplicate dentries.
