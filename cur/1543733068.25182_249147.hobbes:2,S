OK, please explain how I install the latest Unichrome DRI driver.  The
docs at the unichrome site are correct except they refer to this guide
which is out of date:
http://dri.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/Building
How do you expect users to 'just grab the new release' if *your own user
documentation* is incorrect (from the above page):
  NOTE that these instructions may be out of date. According to 
  
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=9295537
 
  parts of DRI have moved to a new repository. 
        "Mesa and DRM are still in the same repositories on
        freedesktop.org. But the DRI enabled DDX drivers are now
        developped in Xorg CVS instead of DRI CVS. See
http://xorg.freedesktop.org
 for details." 
        
Wow, thanks, that explains everything!
This should not be hard.  I have built and installed Xorg from CVS.  I
know what I am doing.  What the heck is a non-coder supposed to do?
All I need is to figure out how to build unichrome_dri.so.  There seems
to be a unichrome directory in the Xorg, Mesa, and DRI CVS trees.  I
should just be able to cd to this directory and type make or make
unichrome_dri.so or something, just like I do to install the via DRI
kernel module, or ALSA modules, or any other kernel module with a
reasonable build process.  Does not work.
If someone tells me how to do this I promise to post a HOWTO.
