I'll announce this here as well as on cola as I have a minor
question.
I've integrated the /proc/config patch with the kernel make even more,
so that it uses the kernel's mkdep.c to search for all CONFIG_* words in
the kernel.  This means that no extra compile time is needed.
However ...  this (the use_config() function in mkdep.c) doesn't seem to
get them all.  Conflating with autoconf.h pretty well covers the rest,
but I think there are some, maybe 50, still missed.
1) Anyone have a general idea about why? The mkdep code has been
sophisticated and optimized beyond my understanding! Werner?  Michael?
2) Would /proc/sys/kernel/config be a better position?
Oh ..  I also let /proc/config be turned on/off via a write.  That was
to address some peoples security concerns and to cut the dynamic memory
requirement to zero when dormant even when compiled in.  It's using
about 2.5K static then.  Not compressed.  Not bad for producing a
listing of about 12K!  No tricks involved.
     Listing kernel compile-time configuration via /proc/config
     ==========================================================
     Proconfig 0.8.2  (2.2.13)
     Changes
     0.8.2   - added on/off switch via echo -n "0" >/proc/config
               (security and saves about 1K temporarily while off).
               integrated CONFIG_* search with kernel mkdep.c
     
     0.8.1   - minor cosmetic buglet fixed.
               replaced shell scripts by C programs.
               unified 2.3.44 and 2.2.13 config.c code
               issued initial patch (0.9) for 2.3.44
