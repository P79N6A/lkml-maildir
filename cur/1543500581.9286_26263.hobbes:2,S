The kernel and registry get stored on the same filesystem.
If the boot loader can find one, it can find the other,
so there is no problem storing a system unique identifier
in the registry.
The NT boot loader can use a boot.ini file to find the above.
I believe there are chopped-down SCSI drivers for the boot loader.
Doesn't Linux already have this ability on the SPARC and Alpha?
It would work on ia32 too, with GRUB, except for the ability to
use a non-BIOS supported root with the kernel being elsewhere.
