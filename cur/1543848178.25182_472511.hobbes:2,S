Just millions?  What's your problem then?
Per file you can estimate 4KiB + 128 bytes for the inode.  That's
about 4.2GB for a million files.  The "wasted" size is still lower, as
small files still require some storage even with tail packing.
And in-memory reiserfs is just as inefficient as any other filesystem,
as it shares the same page cache.
