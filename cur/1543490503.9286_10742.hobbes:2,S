And script written under Linux and using that feature will break

	Excuse me? If you can set sysctls (root-only, otherwise I'll just
reassign the path for sh and wait until the next cron task will run it. As
root) you can set symlinks. Or fix the frigging script, in the first
place. If you are installing the package into unusual place you can bet
that name of interpreter will not be the only thing you'll have to change.
BTW, what will you do with /opt/new-language/bin/make? Or 
/opt/new-langauge/bin/logout, for that matter ;-/

	Sorry, but you've missed the interesting part of it. For example,
perl will react on \r in the script in funny way. You will have to remove
that stuff anyway.
