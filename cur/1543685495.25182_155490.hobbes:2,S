 drm is built in, only radeon.o is a module.  Bizarrely (I rebooted
before the original mail, in case something was hanging on to a file and
stopping it loading), this time it loads.
insmod radeon now gives me
[drm] AGP 0.99 aperture @ 0xe8000000 64MB
[drm] Initialized radeon 1.7.0 20020828 on minor 0
It looks as if I had a problem with depmod, insmod was failing until I
reran depmod -a, and yet that is at the end of my script for rebuilding
the X modules.  Sorry this turns out to be a bogus report.
