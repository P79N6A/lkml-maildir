As long as, of course, making that function an __init would not make
it a class 2 error.

Ick.  Currently, this will work, since if it's not a module, __exit
function never get included or called.  If it is a module, __init does
nothing.
It's incredibly poor taste, though, and if we ever implement __init
dropping for modules (Keith?), it'll break horribly of course.  Thus
it's a bug to call __init functions from __exit functions, but not a
very exciting one.
Rusty.
