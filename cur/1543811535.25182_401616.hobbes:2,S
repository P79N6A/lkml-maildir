After a week of intensive testing, we were finally able to reproduce
this hang.  Sadly, the nmi watchdog did not appear to trigger (I'm
pretty sure it was configured correctly, I did see NMIs occurring).
No information appeared on serial or console (although this time they
weren't blanked).  We're building 2.4.33pre kernel now to try and test
on now to see if we're still able to reproduce using it.
We're beginning to suspect that a hung loopback NFS mount might be to
blame, although we can't reproduce this trivially.  Is there anyway in
which a mount that was behaving badly could affect the kernel in this
manner?
