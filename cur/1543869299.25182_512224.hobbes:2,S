could you please try the patch below? This is pretty much the only 
condition under which we can silently 'leak' pending softirqs, and 
trigger the new warning: if something does cond_resched_softirq() in 
non-runnable state. (which is a no-no, but nothing enforced this, so it 
could in theory happen.) So the question is, with this patch applied, do 
you get these new warnings from sched.c?

Subject: [patch] add warning to cond_resched_softirq()
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
make sure that cond_resched_softirq() is always called with a runnable 
task - so that we do not leave softirq work pending indefinitely.
