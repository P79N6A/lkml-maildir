AlphaPC 264DP 666 MHz (Tsunami, UP)

gcc version 3.0.3
Running stuff as usual, reading large files, I can often get
very long mouse freezes when redrawing a certain window in X after
leaving it for a while.  I never saw this behavior in 2.4.18-rc1,
which I ran for over 1 month doing the same stuff.  vmstat doesn't
report swapping activity that I can see, just a window that should
refresh (no backing store) right away causes long (2~5 sec) freezes.
