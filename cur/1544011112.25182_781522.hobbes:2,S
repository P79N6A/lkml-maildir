The point was that L1 and L2/L3 behave so differently in practice
due to their latency/bandwidth differences (typically L1 is more like a 
slower register file while L3 is more like faster DRAM) that it's unclear
that any generic event not defining what it means is any useful.
I could see the point of generic FLC/LLC cache events perhaps,
but not of a single one lumping these two together.
But although with multi core it looks like 3 level hierarchies are
becoming more and more common and also more important to know
about.
