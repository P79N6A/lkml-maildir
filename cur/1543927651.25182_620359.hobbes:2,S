I've always been confused by this.
If I'm not mistaken, there are three kind of suspend modes: autosuspend, 
suspend to RAM and suspend to disk. In the first case I expect the USB hub 
(either root hub or external hub) to make the bus idle but not power it down. 
In the last case I suspect the USB bus to be powered down.
What controls the USB bus power on suspended ports ? Is it handled by the 
system (BIOS, ...) ? Is it allowed to power down the ports or keep them 
powered as it chooses ? What are the rules set in stone ?

What is reset_resume() for ? Which one will be called on resume after a bus 
power down ?
