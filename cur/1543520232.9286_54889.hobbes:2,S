You just can't have it both ways, either you take the 17k or so for
the uhci driver to allow the kernel to notice device plug ins,
or you don't and then you can plug in whatever you want without
the kernel noticing.
For the usb "client" drivers I have an usb daemon that automatically
loads kernel or even user space drivers, all in user space.
