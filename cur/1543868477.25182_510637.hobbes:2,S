Right.  But as soon as you turn the source back on, in the postamble
of the interrupt dispatch handler, it fires again.  At least on ARM,
that gives you recursive hits to __irq_svc and a couple of nested
calls within it.  Here's a backtrace (embedded in a chat log with some
commentary):
6:42 PM me: we have definitely confirmed that the serial ISR is
failing to clear the interrupt and the (presumably level-triggered)
IRQ is firing again on exit from the ISR.
6:43 PM The reason that __do_softirq is usually the last function
entrypoint in the backtrace before the __irq_svc associated with the
timer is that it is the first place where interrupts are enabled
during the IRQ dispatcher postamble.
6:44 PM Here is a backtrace from a case where the timer interrupt hit
during the perpetually firing ISR instead of during the dispatch code
surrounding it (which is not visible in backtraces)

6:47 PM (ignore the rcu_do_batch lines; we chased the bottom-half
scheduler from __do_softirq to tasklet_action to rcu_do_batch trying
to understand what was getting perpetually scheduled)
6:50 PM (At this stage in the boot process, there are active softirq
handlers associated with the timer queue and the tasklet queue,
several tasklets of which the most active is the rcu callback batch
scheduler, and several types of frequently posted rcu callbacks; these
two are the postponed free() paths associated with the fs cache and
the dentry cache. They are to be expected at this juncture.)

Er, who wrote the ARMv5t implementations of __irq_svc, asm_do_IRQ,
do_level_irq, and __do_irq?  :-)  I don't think there's actually
anything wrong with the interrupt servicing here, and I think it's a
good thing that these routines appear recursively in the backtrace
when the root cause of a lockup is an unserviced level-based IRQ.

Linux assumes incorrectly in this instance.  It would improve the
kernel if all drivers' __init code were refactored into an
IRQ-discovery-ISR-installation pass, followed by a
chip-reset-data-structure-initialization pass, followed by a
chip-configuration-driver-activation pass.  This is unlikely to happen
overnight.  In the meantime, weird UART states on entry into
platform_device_init are a reality.

No, you rely on the caller of serial8250_init to have punctured the
abstraction and forced any and all UARTs to a state where they cannot
possibly generate an IRQ.  Embedded hardware being what it is, this is
IMHO not a great design choice.
