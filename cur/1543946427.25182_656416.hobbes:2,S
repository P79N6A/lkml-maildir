balance_pgdat() calls zone_watermark_ok() three times, the first call
passes a zero(0) in as the 4th argument.  This 4th argument is the
classzone_idx which is used as the index into the zone->lowmem_reserve[] 
array. 
Since setup_per_zone_lowmem_reserve()
always sets the zone->lowmem_reserve[0] = 0(because there is nothing
below the DMA zone), zone_watermark_ok() will not consider the
lowmem_reserve pages when zero is passed as the 4th arg.   The
4th argument must be "i" or balance_pgdat wont even get into the main loop
when lowmem_reserve_ratio is lowered.
