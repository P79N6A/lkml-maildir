It looks reasonable.

Problem is that if you do FBIOPUTCMAP to change (say) entry #0,
FBIOGETCMAP will retrieve default value of entry #0 instead of value
you just set with FBIOPUTCMAP, unless driver updates its info->cmap
itself...

2.4.x does same. But I do not think that it is excuse ;-)

Ok, then there is a problem - as nothing in matroxfb uses info->cmap,
I did not saw any need to initialize it. I'll fix it.
