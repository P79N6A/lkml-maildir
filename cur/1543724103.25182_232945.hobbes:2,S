It's a bad habit, and it's one (of many) bad things C++ does. The sad part 
is that C++ does it for all the wrong reasons - there's no reason to not 
realize that ((void *)0) is an even better special case, and indeed last I 
heard at least gcc does allow that in C++ too.
The fact is, when somebody else picks up a mistake, that doesn't make it 
any less of a mistake. And it's not like C++ is the paragon of good taste 
anyway.
I've seen too damn many people mistake NULL and NUL (admit it, you've seen 
it too), and I've seen code like
	char c = NULL;
and any system where that goes through without a warning is totally 
broken. And yes, that includes a _lot_ of C++ braindamages.
