More specifically, replacing u32 with uint32_t as the kernel-internal 
type would be fine and arguably useful; in fact, a handful of drivers I 
believe already use it.
Replacing __u32 with uint32_t would be wrong, because it would require 
some user space headers that cannot include <stdint.h> to have to do so. 
  POSIX has *very* specific rules for namespace pollution, and most 
libcs have to care about that (klibc doesn't, but it's an exception, not 
the rule.)
