Well, maintainer gets patches from people and should decide which are
good and which are not...
Anyway if you give me your sf.net name, I can probably add you as a
developer to the nbd.sf.net... but: I'd like you to keep userland code
backward compatible. Ie. new userland code should still work with
2.4.x kernel.
