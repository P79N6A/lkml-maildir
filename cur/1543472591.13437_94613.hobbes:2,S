Although I (and my company) as a practice release software GPL whenever
practical, I appreciate the flexibility that Linus offers us. It makes good
sense as there is little difference between a loadable module and an
ordinary program.
Keep in mind that it is sometimes the customers that want propriety, and
not necessarily the producers. This I am acutely aware of.
