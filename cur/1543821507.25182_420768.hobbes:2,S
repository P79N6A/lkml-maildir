Hi all,
Some time arround 2.6.16, Andi added the option "apicpmtimer" (only on
x86_64) that "do APIC timer calibration using the pmtimer".
It seems that 2.6.17-rc3-mm1 fails to boot with that option. The boot
process just stalls. There is no panic nor error message (AFAICT), it
just...stalls. Unfortunately, I really need that "apicpmtimer" option
because the PIT is very broken on my laptop.
With 2.6.16 and 2.6.17-rc3, the boot also stalled with "apicpmtimer",
but pressing the power button again resumed the boot, but not anymore
with 2.6.17-rc3-mm1, it just stays stuck.
I've seen there are some issues with merging the clocksource in
2.6.17-rc3-mm1, but I'm not sure "apicpmtimer" and acpi_pm clocksource
are similar, are they?
Anyway, I applied the patch mentionned in the "clocksource" thread and
that doesn't help.
Thanks in advance,
Cheers,
Olivier.
