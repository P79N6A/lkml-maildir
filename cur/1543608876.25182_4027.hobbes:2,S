/proc is a wonderful thing for what it was originally intended: access to
the process table without looking at the tables in the kernel memory space
(remember SunOS?  what happened if /vmunix wasn't the running kernel?)
Unfortunately, /proc has become the gheto of the Linux kernel.  It is now
the general dumping grounds for user/kernel interfacing.  As a developer tool
it's very handy; it's also very dangerous.  Developers then resort to
/proc as a perminant interface between kernel drivers and userland. (In
the *BSD world, this is a kernfs, not a procfs.)
For an example of /proc done right, find a Solaris box.  What do you find
in /proc?  Gee, process information.  Only process information.  In. Binary.
