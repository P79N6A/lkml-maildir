Honestly, pci.ids is such a non-critical file, unless DaveM disagrees I 
would strongly encourage people to -only- send pci.ids updates to 
sourceforge.
pci.ids is only used in one location -- deprecated /proc/pci -- and will 
be removed in the next year or so, I imagine. Further, pci.ids is 
periodically sync'd en masse from sourceforge into the kernel by janitors.
Users should be using 'lspci' not /proc/pci, and lspci takes it data 
from sourceforge database not the kernel.
