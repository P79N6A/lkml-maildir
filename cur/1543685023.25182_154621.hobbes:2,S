Not sure, but I suspect there would be a problem IF the -bind mount crosses 
filesystems. If it doesn't cross the filesystems I wouldn't think there
would be much problem.
You do have to remember that any NFS export gives IMPLICIT access to the
entire filesystem (it is the device number that is actually exported). If
the attacker can generate device:inode number, then that file reference can
be opened. I haven't read/seen anything yet that has said different.
