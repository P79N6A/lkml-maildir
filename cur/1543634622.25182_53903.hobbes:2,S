That's the important difference here, we have no managers forcing us to
specific goals. We have the time to develop a good solution, we are not
forced to accept a solution which sucks. We have the freedom to constantly
break the kernel and we don't have to maintain backwards compability,
which especially with regard to locking would really suck.
