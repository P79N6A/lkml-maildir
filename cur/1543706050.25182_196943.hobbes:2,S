What do you mean?
I haven't mentioned randomising block allocations at all.
The random number is an encryption key, private to the inode, used to
encrypt the data blocks.  The blocks are allocated efficiently as usual.

My suggestion would be much more efficient than yours: for every file
created and deleted, you do twice the I/O I do.
