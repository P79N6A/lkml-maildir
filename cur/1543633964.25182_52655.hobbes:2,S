Why not.  If user-space has already mapped the memory one way, turning
around and using it another way is a problem.  If the memory is
dynamically allocated for AGP I don't even see how this case
could occur.
But the mmap case still has to apply the general cache ability of the
page from the kernel page tables (or where ever it is cached), if you
do the operation in the opposite order.

Combining different operations like modifying cacheability and the
page protections worries me.  Unless we name the operations something
like change_kernel_page_attr() in which case we are only worrying
about a subset of the problem.  Which it appears that we are.

The kernel already exposes through /proc/mtrr the ability to
arbitrarily change the caching of pages.  And since this is a case
of physical aliasing we need to make certain the mtrr's don't
conflict.  So much of this is already exposed to user space already.

With the PAT table only write-back, write-combining, uncached interest
me.  Given the number of BIOS's that don't set all of RAM to
write-back and the major performance penalty of running on uncached
RAM having the kernel fix it, would reduce a lot of headaches long
term. 
Primarily I'm brining up the connections because it may be worth
considering them.  For 2.4.19 unless the implementation is trivial it
probably isn't wise to try for more that what is needed.  For later
kernels 2.4.x, 2.4.20+ it is almost certainly worth doing something.
