AFAICS:
Before the faulty commit, all code sites which moved something into the
per-idr free list cleared the respective idr_layer.
After the faulty commit, idr_remove_all() forgot to do so.
After your patch, idr_remove_all() still doesn't clear anything.  But
there will typically be idr_destroy() called right after an
idr_remove_all().  idr_destroy() moves all idr_layers out of this idr's
free list back into the kernel-global idr_layer_cache.
Your fix only clears idr_layers which an idr_get_new*() pulls out of the
idr_layer_cache, but not any one which it pulls out of the idr's own
free list.
Hmm, OK.  Seems to be harmless as long as idr users don't start to add
new entries to an idr after they did idr_remove_all().
I presume there is none such user, is there?  Such a usage would be
unusual but not illegal, I suppose.
(Furthermore, I may by thoroughly mistaken about how lib/idr.c works.)
