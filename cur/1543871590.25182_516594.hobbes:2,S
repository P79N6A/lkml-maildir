I would definitly *love* saving dentries for pipes (and sockets too), but how 
are you going to get the inode ?
pipes()/sockets() can use read()/write()/rw_verify_area() and thus need 
file->f_path.dentry->d_inode (so each pipe needs a separate dentry)
Are you suggesting adding a new "struct file_operations" member to get the inode ?
Or re-intoducing an inode pointer in struct file ?
