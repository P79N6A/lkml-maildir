Yes, if a table won't suffice.

Definitely.

I don't think that was abuse, it was just playing by the silly rules
remap_pfn_range and ioremap demanded.

Very hard to find anyone to disagree with you on that!

We do what's most efficient for the core.  Which I think is refcount
both ways regardless, since these "page"s are exceptional, and the
majority really do need refcounting.

But you don't mind if they are refcounted, do you?
Just so long as they start out from 1 so never get freed.

You'll actually be needing nopage() on them?  That idea has come up
before, it's not out of the question (though I think wli suggested
we ought rather to change the nopage interface if so), but it's a
different topic from the current removal of PageReserved anyway.
