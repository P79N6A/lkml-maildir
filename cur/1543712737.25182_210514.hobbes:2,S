Oops, I was getting confused since proc_pid_status() is directly above
proc_pid_stat() in fs/proc/array.c, so I misinterpreted some of the
asm<-->C translation and was stating we were dying in task_name().
Sorry for the confusion.  Will apply Ricky's patch for now as a work
around as it seems fine to me for the moment.
Thanks for the help... 
Cheers,
Andrew

Looks like this problem is same with BSD acct Oops.
	if (task->tty) {
		tty_pgrp = task->tty->pgrp;
		tty_nr = new_encode_dev(tty_devnum(task->tty));
	}
Some place doesn't take the any lock for ->tty. I think we need to
take the lock for ->tty.
