Just to clarify... I can see how recursive reclaim can prevent memory getting
eaten up by reclaim (which thus causes allocations from interrupt handlers to
fail)...
But this patchset I don't see will do anything to prevent reclaim deadlocks,
right? (because if there is reclaimable memory at hand, then kswapd should
eventually reclaim it).
