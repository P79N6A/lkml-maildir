"such a tradeoff" ?
While this sounds reasonable, I have to point out that
up to now nobody has described exactly WHAT tradeoff
they'd like to make tunable and why...
I'm not against making things tunable, but I would like
to at least see the proponents of tunable things explain
WHAT they want tunable and exactly WHY.
regards,
Rik
