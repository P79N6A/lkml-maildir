Strange, because it doesn't merge with your other own changes. It might be 
an ordering thing (ie they might have merged fine in another order). Or 
maybe it's just because the -mm scripts will force-apply patches (or drop 
them).
Anyway, there were clashes in drivers/usb/core/usb.c with the patch "USB: 
fix usb_find_interface for ppc64" that came through your USB changes, and 
that gets a merge error with the uevent/hotplug thing.
I can do the trivial manual fixup, but when I do, I have two copies of 
"usb_match_id()": one in drivers/usb/core/driver.c and one in 
drivers/usb/core/usb.c.
I've pushed out my tree, so that you can see for yourself (it seems to 
have mirrored out too).
