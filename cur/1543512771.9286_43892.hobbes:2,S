Subject: i486 can't keep up with 2.2.12 ?

I have an old i486 machine with a not quite so old Cyrix 5x86 cpu and
four IDE drives. (I have unmasked irq's on all drives so that's not an
issue.) Using a 2.2.12 kernel and pppd 2.3.9, there are a fairly large
number of packet errors. With just virtual consoles (no X) and just one
user program (fetchmail) running, ifconfig shows this:
ppp0      Link encap:Point-to-Point Protocol
          UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:4301 errors:12 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:12  <---
          TX packets:4213 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:
Over a longer period of 64 minutes, ifconfig reported more frame errors
and "netstat -s" showed
TcpExt:
    105 packets pruned from receive queue because of socket buffer
overrun
which doesn't seem good.
None of this happens with a 2.0.38 kernel and pppd 2.2.0f.
I can see that this might be due to a change in the disk code or in the
network code or in pppd. Does anyone have any ideas?
Thanks.
