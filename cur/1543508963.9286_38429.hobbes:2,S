The RAID code in the current "official stable kernel" is mostly
non-functional.  I don't know a respectable administrator that would
use the existing RAID code in a production system while a very "stable"
newer RAID system is available.  In effect, the RAID code in the
current stable kernel is "broken" and needs the bug fix as implemented
in 0.90.  That this bug fix requires a backup and restore, which should
not be an issue for someone serious about RAID, is inconsequential.  If
someone doesn't want to upgrade to fix the RAID bug, then let them stay
on 2.2.12.

You seem to prefer holding back software updates that have been tested
and tested and tested simply to fit your belief in the old model of a
"stable" and "development" kernel.  I don't think you realize that

Instead, they use the releases that their distribution company makes. 
It's no longer the "old" way where everyone in the Linux community
would download and compile the latest kernel release as soon as it came
out.  Our community has grown to include "others" that don't have the
necessary skill or time in order to test out new "stable" kernels and
rely on the distributions.  In effect, there are three levels of kernel
"releases" now, developmental, stable, and distribution.  The "stable"
kernel releases are no less stable than they have always been.  The new
RAID code is not "developmental."

Why, so Linux won't have a "real" RAID system until sometime next year?
 Perhaps you don't realize that the 0.90 code was release a LONG time
ago.
