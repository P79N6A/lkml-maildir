Hi,
This series of patches enables Aggressive Link Power Management for AHCI 
devices, as documented in the AHCI spec.  On my laptop (a Lenovo X60), this
saves me a full watt of power.  On other systems, reported power savings
range from .5-1.5 Watts.  It has been tested by the kind folks at #powertop
with similar results.  Please give it a try and let me know what you think.
thanks,
Kristen
