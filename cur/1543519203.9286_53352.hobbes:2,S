Hello,
We have a problem making Linux booting when the keyboard (i386) is removed.
We have of course already done that on a few machines here without
trouble, but this machine is hanging just after LILO says "Loading linux...".
I guess that the kernel is properly loaded, but it does not even show
any indication that it is starting to uncompress itself.
With the keyboard, everything is OK.
What could happen ? What kind of information could I provide ?
It has to be said that the machine is not a standard PC, but instead
a little packaged box.
Any information would be useful, since we did not expect to have any
trouble with that, and we have to ship the box tomorrow !
Thanks in advance,
A+,
