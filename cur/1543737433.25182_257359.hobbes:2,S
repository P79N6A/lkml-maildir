First of all, we're still on the first set of these APIs.  So, either
we're really, really smart (unlikely) or we have a few revisions an
rewrites to go before everybody is happy.
ls /sys/devices/system/memory/ gives you each memory area, with
arbitrary numbers like this:
memory0
memory1
memory2
memory8953
We haven't decided whether to make each of those represent a constant
sized area, or let them be variable.  In any case, there will either be
a range inside of each or a global block size something like here:
	/sys/devices/system/memory/block_size
Each memory device would have a directory like this:
# ls /sys/devices/system/memory/memory8953/
node -> ../../node/node4 (for the NUMA case)
state
phys_start_addr
To take a memory section offline, you 
	echo offline > /sys/devices/system/memory/memory8953/state
For now, that takes the section offline by allocating all of its pages
and migrating the test.  It also removes the sysfs node, triggering a
/sbin/hotplug event for the device removal.  We might makes this 2
different states in the future (offline and removal).  This could also
potentially be triggered by hardware alone.
For now, you can also add memory, but it's hackish and will certainly
change:
	echo 0x8000000 > /sys/devices/system/memory/probe
will add SECTION_SIZE amount of memory at 2GB.  Yes, SECTION_SIZE is
hard-coded, but this is only for testing.  We'll eventually take ranges
and maybe NUMA information into there somehow.  Why can't the hardware
just do this?  It's a long story :)
