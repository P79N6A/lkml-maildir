I think your dependencies are backwards. IIRC, and based on a recent 
conversation, ACPI needs to access PCI config space when ACPI finds a 
_INI method for a device in the ACPI namespace. That assumes that it can 
access the root bus that the device is on. 
You don't have a PCI device because you haven't implement lockstep 
enumeration yet in ACPI. With lockstep enumeration, you would add devices 
to the device tree and let the bus drivers initialize them. With a bit a 
glue, you would have a pointer to the PCI device correlating to the ACPI 
namespace object, and a pointer to the PCI bus on which each PCI 
device/namespace object resides. 
To spell it out a bit more explicitly, you would start to parse the ACPI
namespace and find a Host/PCI bridge. You would tell the PCI subsystem to
probe for a device at that address. It would come back successful, and you
would obtain a pointer to that bridge device (and bus object). For all the
subordinate devices to that bridge, you then have access to the config
space via a real struct pci_bus.
There is no need to modify the PCI interface to support a fake device. The 
PCI driver needs to be able to add and probe for devices as dictated by 
someone else, but it's not that difficult.
If you remember, I sent you a patch that did most of this about 5 months 
ago. It's a bit out of date, and I guarantee that it doesn't apply 
anymore. But the concept is the same: we should fix the drivers, not hack 
them to support a broken interface.
