AFAIR ALSA always set the setting to zero.
I can only guess why. My buest guess is that not all
sound-configurations are the same, on some systems the "defaults" could
much to loud. (e.g. waking the neigbours when you restart you computer
at night)
I can perfectly understand the ALSA-guys. It's a bit annoying, but
nothing an init-script can't fix. -> Distro problem.
(And i guess the "OSS-gab" was filled by the Distro)
(Personally i use my own "S99misc" init-script which, apart from some other
things, loads the sound-driver and then sets the mixer-levels.)
