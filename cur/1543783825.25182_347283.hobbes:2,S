Seconded.  I haven't rebuilt the 1.0.6 code against the 2.6.13-git
kernels, but my 2.6.13-rc4 build with 1.0.6 ipw2200 in it seems much
more stable and dependable at starting up a network than
2.6.13-git-current does.
(For example, I had to do a full power-cycle to get things working again
after I ran into a "failed to send TX_POWER" issue - I've never seen
that before, but I've never run the 1.0.0 driver before today.)
