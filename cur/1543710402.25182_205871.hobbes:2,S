Suggestion: take a look at the changelog for 2.4.25 and see what changes
could have effect on your network performance.
For example, I had problems with my 3Com card in 2.6.4-mm1, but no on
2.6.3-mm1, so looking at the changelog I saw changes made into 3c59x.c.
Reverting one of those changes fixed my problem.
