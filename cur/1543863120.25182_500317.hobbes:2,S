Note that these dd "benchmarks" are completely bogus, because the data 
doesn't actually get written to disk in that time. For some enlightening 
data, try
  time dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/1GB bs=1M count=1024; time sync
The dd returns as soon as all data could be buffered in RAM. Only sync 
will show how long it takes to actually write out the data to disk.
also explains why you see better results is writeout starts earlier.
