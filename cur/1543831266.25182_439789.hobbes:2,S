You asked for a fault, and as long as the hardware supports it, you'll
get one (and you're supposed to). If the hardware doesn't support read
faults on mapped pages, you may not get all the read faults you want. The
proposed patch makes the situation worse by disabeling the _requested_
failures even in situations where it can be done.
