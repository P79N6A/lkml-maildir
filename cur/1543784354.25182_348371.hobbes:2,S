The fact that it's called regardless of SUPPORT_SYSRQ and some callers
look like
#ifdef SUPPORT_SYSRQ
int foo(blah, struct pt_regs *regs)
#else
int foo(blah)
#endif
{
	...
	uart_handle_sysrq_char(..., regs);
	...
}
which works with old definition (without SUPPORT_SYSRQ the last argument of
uart_handle_sysrq_char() is never seen by parser) and obviously dies with
the new one.
And yes, it's sick...
