Why do you want to make the bus number larger than the PCI bus number
register?
It seems like adding 'unsigned int domain_num' makes more sense, and is
more correct.  Maybe that implies fixing up other code to use a
(domain,bus) pair, but that's IMHO a much better change than totally
changing the interpretation of pci_bus::bus_number...

3) (tiny issue) Change pci_dev::slot_name such that it includes the
domain number.  This is passed to userspace by SCSI and net drivers as a
way to allow userspace to associate a kernel interface with a bus
device.

yep
