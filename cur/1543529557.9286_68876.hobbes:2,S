That's about a patch to remove the kernel command line limit, not the
Makefile problem btw.

If you want it to run really sslloowwllyy, that's fine.  But xargs
should be working anyway.  Maybe there's a problem with the environment
space being too large (which I don't think xargs considers).  `env -u'
command can be used to remove a large environment string, if there is
one inherited from `make' for example.
