oh? I thought I was pretty careful about that
looking over the patches again I can't find any reason for a non-compiling/working kernel; at any step..
can you show me the compile error you got or the bug you found?
Also, I generally like this order since this order allows you to bisect stackprotector patches itself, rather than the
artificial "add a bunch of dead code and then suddenly turn the light on" approach..
