No, that's not the real problem. Even if the kernel didn't lack
any required functionality and it could all be done today without
VirtualBox, pulling the rug from underneath it like that leaves
all those who are currently relying on it without the ability to
continue testing newer kernels until they find the time to redesign
their working environment. Sticking to the removal schedule could
have avoided that.
