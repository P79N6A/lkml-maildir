With the patch against 2.4.19:
Scheduler O(1), Preemptible, Low Latency
I have now added two extra alternative patches that include 
either Rik's rmap (thanks Rik) or AA's vm changes (thanks to Nuno Monteiro for
merging this)
For the record, with the (very) brief usage of these two patches I found the
rmap patch a little faster. This is very subjective and completely untested.
Check them out here and tell me what you think(please read the FAQ):
