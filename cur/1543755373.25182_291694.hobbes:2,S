I'll nack this patch for now Adrian, but I'm going to bring all these
changes into the DRM tree as soon as I can.. one of the functions you
removed pointed out a bug in the i810/i830/i915 drivers (granted
no-one uses pageflip in those drivers but still should fix it..), I'm
going to put the through drm CVS first...
Thanks,
Dave.
