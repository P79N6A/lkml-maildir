Subject: Intel MB + P4 HT: bios processors logo depends on what?

A bit silly point maybe but it is somewhat interesting what makes BIOS 
on Intel motherboard decide which processor's logo to display.
Situation:
a) Fedora Core 4 test1  + kernel-2.6.11-1.1177_FC4smp
- going to reboot from fedora the bios shows always processors logo with 
HT marks
b) Mandrake 10.2 rc1 + kernel-2.6.11-5mdksmp
- after reboot there is processor logo without HT marks
c) Mandrake + kernel-2.6.12-rc1-mm1 (compiled with SMP+SMT)
- same as b)
There is nothing wrong with those kernels but it is interesting why 
Fedora's kernel (acpi daemon?) is somewhat special here.
thanks,
Indrek
