Hmmm, it almost sounds like implementing clock_gettime as a syscall and 
exporting jiffies as CLOCK_MONOTONIC is the way to go, as that gives a 
nanosecond resolution export of jiffies.  Then, it would make sense to 
use that as the basis for "when" timeouts.  Relative timeouts still have 
a certain simplicity to them that is appealing, though.
