I don't generally disagree with that, I just think that defines are not 
part of that list.
Look, it's great that you do reviews, but please keep in mind it's the 
author who has to work with code and he has to be primarily happy with, 
so you don't have to point out every minor issue.
Although it also differs between core and driver code, we don't have to be 
that strict with driver code as longs as it "looks" ok and is otherwise 
correct. The requirements for core kernel code are higher, but even here 
defines are a well accepted language construct.
bye, Roman
