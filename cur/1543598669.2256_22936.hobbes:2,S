Yes.  What happened here is that %ds and %es were not being updated
atomically.  Under normal operation, this would just leave %es with
USER_DS, which is sufficiently equivalent to KERNEL_DS to not cause a
fault.  Coming out of vm86 mode however forces the data segment
registers to null after saving the real mode values on the stack.  If an
interrupt happened between setting %ds and %es (what are the odds?) then
that assumption would fail and leave %es null, causing the next string
instruction to go boom.  The same fix should be applied to entry.S as
well.
