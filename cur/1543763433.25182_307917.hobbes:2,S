The try_to_swap_out( ) function attempts to free a given page frame, either
discarding or swapping out its contents. It will add the page to swap and
remove the entry from page table of page cache.
In 2.6.x series you can look into shrink_list() function which is called
from kswapd daemon. The function you are trying to look for an
equivalent of try_to_swap_out() is add_to_swap() and after that
try_to_unmap() which will add the page of page cache to swap cache
and remove entry from the page table respectively.
