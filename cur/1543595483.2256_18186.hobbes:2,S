me.  I took issue with the MAINTAINERS file when Eric brought it up
originally.  However, I don't think drastic measures need to be taken.
I have seen a lot of ideas, including Meta-data in the kernel source.
What I think we need is the simple solution: find a maintainer for the
file, cleanup the current cruft and misinformation, and then actively
work to keep the file current.  I am willing to be this maintainer.
I am not a major "maintainer" in the kernel, but I have and do
contribute.  Thus I think this is a good task for me.  I am willing and
wanting to do this.  Comments?
