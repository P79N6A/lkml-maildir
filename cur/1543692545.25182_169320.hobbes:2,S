. The problem is in "*d2->d_name", the address space get
lost at evaluate_dereference of "*". It is a monster macro right
there. The simple version is:
struct dentry {
        char d_name[256];
};
int foo (void) {
        struct dentry __attribute__((noderef, address_space(1))) *d2;
        __typeof__(*d2->d_name) *__pu_addr = d2->d_name;
                   ^^^^^^^^^^^
}

Besids address sapce, it seems that the source and target base type
is pointer of char_ctype instead of pointer of void_ctype. I get lost
there.
