No, git tracks states and where they came from, not changes per se. That 
is, when you look at a commit by David Miller, you're looking at exactly 
the file contents that David Miller had when making the commit. Some other 
systems linearize history such that what you'd see in Linus's tree is what 
David Miller would have had if he'd made his changes to the tree Linus had 
before merging David's branch, but that's not the normal thing to do with 
git in this case.

Tree E doesn't change versions; it's got the same version as A. But C and 
D pick up the version change from B, which means that C and E have 
different versions. You could also look at it like this: going back from D 
to F changes the version, not because anybody on the lower path changed 
it, but because Linus included the version change from his own side when 
doing the merge.

2.6.26-rc1 is bad, 2.6.25 is good, vanilla 2.6.25-rc1 is good, but some 
modified version of 2.6.25-rc1 was bad. It's like if you take 2.6.25, and 
you leave the Makefile the same but change some driver. You can find that 
your 2.6.25 is now broken, while the original 2.6.25 is not. What's going 
on in this bisect run is that Rene's seeing this same situation, but from 
the perspective of looking back from the future and looking at somebody 
else's state.
