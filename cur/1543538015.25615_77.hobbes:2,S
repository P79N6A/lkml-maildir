Yes, that is what I would do... if printk is being recursively called AND
kmalloc can't help us out... then we really have problems. :)

Agreed, except that this only occurs for one specific case that *induces
deadlock* right now, and is only likely to be run into when debugging
stuff (ie lots of printk's are added)... let me add emphasis
here: SEMANTICS/INVOKED FUNCTIONS ARE CHANGED FOR ANY CASES THAT DOES NOT
CURRENTLY INDUCE DEADLOCK.  As such, I see no problem with just "BUG"ing
if we are really screwed.
