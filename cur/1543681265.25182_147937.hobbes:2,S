Umm, I didn't not remove anything.  I backported Jan's code from 2.5
long ago and resynched with 2.5 from time to time.  I sent this code
to Alan and Andrea for -aa and -ac and now sent it to you with the
changes you requested (make the old quota format and userland ABI
compiled in unconditionally.)
Now it seems Alan merged other stuff without telling the person
who send him the original patch, thus -ac seems to have code the
XFS tree and -aa don't have.
I've now extracted the ext3 quota changes from -ac for you.  Note
that their only relation of them to the new quota code is that
the patch is ontop of it and thus takes it into account, the problem
is an old one.
Here's the patch, probably the last 2.4 patch from me if we really
want to play the hot potatoe game.

s/cause/not fix existing/
p.s. yes, the patch is more ugly than anything I'd usually submit.
but it's not mine and I don't have any interest in it.  merge it asis
or clean it up yourself - I don't care anymore.
