Hello all,
        The following is a kernel 2.6.6 patch for the ib700wdt watchdog 
driver. I tried to mail Charles Howes, but his address seems to be down.
	The modified file is ib700wdt.c
	The thing which is modified :
 ibwdt_ping() : a bug removed ,port value must be written not the timeout in 
second
        Comments are welcome,
        Best regards
        Patrice BOUCHAND
