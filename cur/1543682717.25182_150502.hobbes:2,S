Been there, done that. :)
Use the patch below, enable the stack checking in your .config and
watch the system log get filled.  5k is quite agressive, I agree, but
with 4k stacks in mind, it is just 1k of slack left, plus the
measurement is a bit fuzzy, so you really want some slack.
Maybe there is also a patch flying around that initializes the stack
with some magic number on a fork and logs the number of used bytes on
exit.  That way you get rid of the fuzzyness, but you loose the exact
call trace that led to this number.

Measure. Don't tune for speed until you've measured, and even then
don't unless one part of the code overwhelms the rest.
