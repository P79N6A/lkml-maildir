I was attempting to perform an "emerge --sync" as root on my Gentoo 
system to update the portage tree (the actual meaning of this command is 
irrelevant, so don't worry if you're not familiar with it) and had it 
fail while attempting to change directories.  I found this to be quite 
strange, as I was running the synchronization as root.  The directory in 
question was, "/usr/portage/mail-mta/msmtp".  Sure enough, manually 
changing directories failed with a "permission denied".  I then CD'ed to 
"/usr/portage/mail-mta" and executed a "ls -la".  To my surprise, there 
was no directory named "msmtp" in "/usr/portage/mail-mta".  I then tried 
to change to a random directory name, to verify that the error message 
wasn't just generic.  "cd foo" returned "No such file or directory", as 
expected.
Following is basically an outline of the steps I performed, which lead 
to my confusion:
cgx-mail / # cd /usr/portage/mail-mta/
cgx-mail mail-mta # ls -la
ls: msmtp: Permission denied

At this point, I'm not really sure what's going on.
Can anybody help me out?  I've posted any information I thought would be 
relevant.  If you need anything else, feel free to let me know.
Thank you,
