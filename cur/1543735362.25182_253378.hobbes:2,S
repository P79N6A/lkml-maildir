IMHO this would be more likely to fix bugs than introduce them so long
as the BKL is acquired before spinlocks in all instances. There are
many instances where scheduling under the BKL is inadvertent and thus
racy, but very few (if any) where the BKL is an inner lock or a holder
of the BKL yields so something that will wake it can acquire the BKL.
