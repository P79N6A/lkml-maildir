I don't want a tree where every driver has seventeen lines of if IBM and
not 64bit || parisc || x86 || !x86_64 || ia64) && (!wednesdayafternoon)
Its *unmaintainable*.
The sparc64 people don't do it, the mips people don't do it, the ia64
people don't do it, wtf should you get to fill config.in with crap
The _ISA stuff makes sense, thats sensible, but the rest - when people
moan we tell em to fix the drivers.
