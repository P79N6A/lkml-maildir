How about a truly simple idea: 
rmdir A says "directory in use" and is rejected
Which means you simply cannot remove the first directory entry before not all
other links to it are removed. This implies only two things: 
1) you have to know who was first.
2) you have to be able to find out where the links are.
Both sound solvable.
