Maybe we need some heuristics for "upgrading" old .config files in
the event of a "make oldconfig". They could be of the form of rules
like this:
CONFIG_obsolete1 && CONFIG_obsolete2 -> CONFIG_new1=y, CONFIG_new2=y
(In a separate file, and entries would be aged. Maybe config tools
could even walk users through this interactively, or flag settings
obtained this way specially, e.g. with a similing wizard icon ;-)
Maybe even add some descriptive text after the rule.)
This still doesn't help for hard to find or obscurely named options,
but at least people upgrading wouldn't be bitten every time something
is renamed or restructured.
