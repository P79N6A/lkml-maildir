Hi Marcelo,
it would be very nice if you could, as Linus does, give a short rough 
outline about what has changed in the released kernel version. 
Just major and important changes because not everyone wants to read 
through all of it. Even in official kernel series many people would 
probably like to see such a short outline.
Best regards,
Axel Siebenwirth
