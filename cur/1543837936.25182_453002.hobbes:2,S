So why not simply run spin_lock_init() in the kevent_storage_init() caller?
Does kevent_poll_reinit() have any callers?

You missed this?

What does that mean?  What is it for?
Does it expose jiffies to userspace?
It truncates jiffies on 64-bit machines.

We use module_init() for non-modular modules all the time.  Try doing
grep module_init */*.c
