I'm working on a wireless network experiment.  The hub is running
linux.  I want to route packets from the ethernet via a proprietary
PCI card.
I'm looking for ideas on the software architecture.
I'm assuming that most of the protocol is running in user mode (tell
me if that's a bad assumption).  The data rates are not very high -
only up to 100's of kbit/s.  One approach I think is to route to a new 
network interface.  A kernel driver is then needed to pass data to the 
usermode program.  The usermode program will pass data to the PCI card 
via another driver.
Do any other approaches come to mind?  Any examples?  Can I route the
data directly to my usermode program from the ethernet?
