That happens often enough now, with exactly that result - just read
the constant stream of bug reports on linux-kernel where this has
clearly happenned, with precicely the result you quote...
What we really could use is for inetd to auto-restart them if
something turns up for them to log...

Since the situation already happens often enough, you're basically
surrendering that 'bit of memory' for nothing...
Best wishes from Riley.
