Just released a small update to ethtool, version 2, posted at
	
http://sourceforge.net/projects/gkernel/
Like its cousin "blktool", ethtool now has a simplified version scheme, 
an ascending number.
For those unfamiliar with ethtool, it is a utility designed to configure 
specific features founds on most ethernet cards.
Summary of changes (mainly the new version scheme):
         * Feature: ethtool register dump raw mode
         * Feature: return results of self-test back to OS via exit(2)
         * Feature: add verbose register dump for pcnet32, fec_8xx
         * Maintenance: update to more recent autoconf
         * Maintenance: minor updates to e1000-specific module
         * Bug fix: Remove silly restriction on ethernet interface naming
