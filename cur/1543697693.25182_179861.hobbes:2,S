It depends. Checking gap length (exactly) and location of one track
relative to the next would require drives with synchronized spindles to
copy the data iff the gap information is used as encryption key. Whether
Linux is up to the task, is something different. Last time I tried such
a thing was in the good old Commodore 1541 days which also supported
half-steps between tracks and stepping after 1/3rd track or some things.
