You didn't exactly need a NetApp for this. A RH 7.3 NFS client with a
Solaris 2.6 NFSv3 server box and a switched, trunked 100 MBit network
was very very sufficient. I have the mrtg printouts still on the wall
in my office. 46 hours of solid 93 Mbits/sec of fragmented NFS packets
chewing off traffic on its VLAN and dropping everything else out of
the backbone trunks. Every service and their grandmothers died around
here. :-)
Ah, the joys of NFS.
