Yup, that's me, guilty on all charges.

It's not.  I never said that we should solve the same problems the same
way that Sun did, go back and read the posting.

No, that wasn't me.  I said it shouldn't scale beyond 4 cpus.  I'd be pretty
lame if I said it couldn't scale with more than 2.  Should != could.

Sorry it came out like that, I haven't changed my mind one bit.

OK, so you got the wrong message.  I do _not_ like the approach Sun took,
it's a minor miracle that they are able to make Solaris work as well as
it works given the design decisions they made.
What I do like is Sun's engineering culture.  They work hard, they don't
back away from the corner cases, they have high standards.  All of which
and more are, in my opinion, a requirement to try and solve the problems
the way they solved them.
So the problem I've been stewing on is how you go about scaling the OS
in a way that doesn't require all those hot shot sun engineers to make
it work and maintain it.
