i've been worried about that myself and i've done extensive measurements 
before choosing this implementation. The rbtree turned out to be a quite 
compact data structure: we get it quite cheaply as part of the task 
structure cachemisses - which have to be touched anyway. For 1000 tasks 
it's a loop of ~10 - that's still very fast and bound in practice.
here's a test i did under CFS. Lets take some ridiculous load: 1000 
infinite loop tasks running at SCHED_BATCH on a single CPU (all inserted 
into the same rbtree), and lets run lat_ctx:
  neptune:~/l> uptime
  22:51:23 up 8 min,  2 users,  load average: 713.06, 254.64, 91.51
  neptune:~/l> ./lat_ctx -s 0 2
  "size=0k ovr=1.61
  2 1.41
lets stop the 1000 tasks and only have ~2 tasks in the runqueue:
  neptune:~/l> ./lat_ctx -s 0 2
  "size=0k ovr=1.70
  2 1.16
so the overhead is 0.25 usecs. Considering the load (1000 tasks trash 
the cache like crazy already), this is more than acceptable.
