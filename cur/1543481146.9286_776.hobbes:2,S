About the logical/physical geometry thing, right?
Logical geometry used by Linux must be such that Linux can calculate the
correct physical geometry from it.
Now, the long answer:

You are (almost) right.
Let's try to explain the situation:
In order to talk to the disk, Linux needs to know its physical geometry:
either the correct C/H/S to give meaningful C/H/S address or the LBA
capacity. LBA means that Linux and the disk use the 'linear sector number'
to communicate, which makes things much easier.
Now, IDE disks can have at most 16 *physical* heads. If you tell the kernel
that the geometry of your disk is 787/128/63 (as with my 3G Western Digital)
the kernel will use the *physical* geometry 6296/16/63 for C/H/S addressing
(it's deduced from the logical geometry you specify, knowing Heads<=16)
or will use LBA, knowing that the disk has 6346368 sectors (approx 3GB).
Till now things are simple: get your disk *physical* geometry,
invent a COMPATIBLE logical geometry and tell it to the kernel.
By 'compatible' I mean: the kernel must be able to deduce the correct physical
geometry from it. It's easy since the kernel divides by 2 the number of heads
and multiplies by 2 the numbers of cylinders, until heads<=16, to get the
physical geometry.
So the working logical geometries for my disk would be any of:
 787/128/63
1574/ 64/64
3148/ 32/63
6296/ 16/63 (equal to the physical geometry)
(the number of logical heads must be <= 255)
The hard part comes now: The Linux kernel is not the only software on the
world, so it must agree with other software about where the partitions are.
In particular:
a) The *logical* geometry, and not the *physical* one is used to
   describe partitions on the disk partition table, due to braindead
   design of partition table.
   This is actually one of the reasons *logical* geometry was invented.
   It also means that Linux fdisk wants to know the logical geometry
   (it asks it to the kernel)
b) If you have DOS partitions on that disk, DOS and Linux must agree
   about where partitions are. Also DOS fdisk and Linux fdisk must agree.
   So the logical geometry told to the Linux kernel should agree as much as
   possible with the one that DOS will get from the BIOS.
   In particular the number of heads and sectors must be the same.
   Given that, if the BIOS tells DOS a lower number of cylinders,
   DOS will only be able to access the first part of the disk.
   And the BIOS can report 1024 cylinders at maximum...
   To make things nastier, very old BIOSes always report the *physical*
   geometry.
Also, LILO must be able to load the Linux kernel from disk using BIOS services,
and this may give some problems, as said above: the BIOS can report (and access)
only up to 1024 logical cylinders.
Again, logical geometry used by the BIOS (and by LILO) must match
as much as possible with the one used by Linux (heads and cyls must match)
or nasty things can happen.

That's just RedHat fdisk (or whatever you used) being too picky.
As explained above, for LILO to work, the kernel must be within the 1024
logical cyilinders. If you make a partition within that limit and put all
LILO files in it (the kernel image and the various /boot/* files) you are ok.
Then you can make other partitions above the 1024-cyl limit, and Linux will
happily use them.

If the logical geometry used by Linux is compatible with the one reported by
BIOS (same # of heads and sectors, said above), using Linux fdisk is safe even
on a disk with LILO installed and/or holding DOS partitions.

Hehe. That's not so a crude hack indeed... but a safe way to be sure that DOS
will honour a partition ;)
