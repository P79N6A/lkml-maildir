Welcome to the "wonderful" world of the Maestro 3i.  You'll find
the following URL to be of interest...
http://www.zabbo.net/mailman/listinfo/maestro-users
Executive summary: a free driver is in its infancy, and you're
more than welcome to join the debugging effort.  If you *must*
have sound capability, go to 
http://www.opensound.com
 and get the
OSS driver: that will run you $15 for the base driver, and
another $15 for the ESS Maestro add-on.  It works well on my Dell
Latitude CPx.  You can try before you buy, and the 2.4.X kernel
support is pretty good: new driver versions lag the release of a
2.4.0-testX kernel by less than a week in most cases.
Good luck!
