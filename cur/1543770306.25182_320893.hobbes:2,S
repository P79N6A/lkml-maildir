Would it be reasonable for note_interrupt() to operate on per-CPU or
per-group-of-CPUs counters?  Each CPU (or group) could either separately
count and check, or, if accuracy is important (can't see why it would
be), the per-CPU (or group) counters could be added to a global counter
every 100 (or 1,000 or whatever) counts, and this global counter then
checked against the limit.
