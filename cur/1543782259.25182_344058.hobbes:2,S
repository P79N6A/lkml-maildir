Hey,
Following a mini-bof (lunch actually) at OLS, we decided to set up a
dedicated mailing list on which to discuss development of the Linux key
retention code (a.k.a. keyrings, a.k.a. AFS, NFS, and CIFS?
authentication tokens) and the associated userland utilities.
The list will be moderated in order to keep the volume of spam down, but
anyone interested is free to join up at
  
http://linux-nfs.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/keyrings
Cheers,
  Trond
