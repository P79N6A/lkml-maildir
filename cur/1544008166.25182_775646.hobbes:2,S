Why you want this static instead of per-cpu?

Well, I need more than eax. We could rewrite this union to include
eax, edx,  So I propose we call it union cpuid10 and define it as:
union cpuid_eax {
       struct {
               unsigned int version_id:8;
               unsigned int num_counters:8;
               unsigned int bit_width:8;
               unsigned int mask_length:8;
       } split_eax;
       struct {
              unsigned int num_counters:5;
              unsigned int bit_width:8;
              unsigned int reserved:19;
       } split_edx;
       unsigned int full;
}
