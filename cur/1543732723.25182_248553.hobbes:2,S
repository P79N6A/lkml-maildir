OK, I will give this a shot.  Now that the VP patches are stabilizing I
will be doing more profiling.  I also want to try the -mm kernel, this
has some interesting differences from the stock kernel.  For example I
measured about a 10% improvement with the old method, which implies a
big performance gain.

Yup, my thoughts exactly, this would just tell us what we already know,
that the latency gets better with each version.

I am mostly just using normal desktop hacker workloads, web browsing,
email, builds.  Lately I am using the box as a Samba server.  At first,
I was stressing the system using every disk benchmark I could think of,
but it never seemed to affect the worst case and did not even change the
shape of the distribution much, so I don't bother.  For all practical
purposes, it's impossible to change the shape of these graphs much by
stressing the system.
I am able to induce large latencies by using up all available swap with
make -j12 on a KDE program, and by pingflooding the broadcast address,
but these are pathological enough that I have not worried about them.
