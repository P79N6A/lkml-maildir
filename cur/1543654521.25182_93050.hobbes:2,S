Hi!
I have a MSI KT3Ultra2 Motherboard with a VT8235 southbridge. I'm currently 
running kernel 2.4.19 - unfortunately it doesn't detect the southbridge, 
so I cannot enable dma.
I tried the patch from Vojtech Pavlik (via82cxxx), but then it hangs at 
boot:
hdc: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hdc: status timeout: error=0x00
hdc: drive not ready for command
hdc: ATAPI reset timed-out, status=0x80
hdd: DMA disabled
ide1: reset: success
hdc: status timeout: status=0x80 { Busy }
hdc: status timeout: error=0x01IllegalLengthIndication
hdc: drive not ready for command
hdc: ATAPI reset timed-out, status=0x80
ide1: reset: success
hdc: status timeout: status=0x80 { Busy }
hdc: status timeout: error=0x01IllegalLengthIndication
end_request: I/O error, dev hdc, sector 0
hdc: drive not ready for command
I tried the last 2.5.x kernels and today the 2.4.20, everytime the same 
problem. 2.4.19 boots just fine, but without dma :-(
Btw: hdc ist my dvd drive:
starbase:/# cat proc/ide/hdc/model
TOSHIBA DVD-ROM SD-M1302
starbase:/#
Any hints? It's a real pain to work without dma....
Thanks,
Patrick
