From: Rusty Russell <>
Subject: [PATCH 1/3] Documentation and example updates
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/4/250

1) Example code: old libc headers don't have SIOCBRADDIF, and old zlibs
   don't have gzdirect() -- it's a sanity check anyway.
2) Some people don't build in their source directories, so .config
   isn't there (thanks to Tony Breeds <tony@bakeyournoodle.com>).
3) Point out that guest and host kernel are usually the same.
4) Set the "no checksum" option on the tun device as a minor optimization.
