Ok, I wasn't aware that this rwsem had many concurrent readers. From whatever
little I could see (during system boot and during kernel compilation with
make -j), the number of concurrent readers very rarely touched 3 and was 1
mostly. May be there are other concurrent readers of this sem. Any idea
from where they could be coming from ?
