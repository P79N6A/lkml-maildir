Huh ?
I suppose you mean, that I can get the name of the executable that caused the
core dump, when running size - right ?
Well, you can do that easier with the file command.
But that doesn't prevent my 7 other processes from overwriting the core file
of the 8'th process which was the first one to crash.   Multi-process systems
can, on occation, produce such "domino dumps".   Separate names is a *must have*.
And having process names is nicer than having PIDs - I don't mind if my core
files are over-written on subsequent runs, actually it's nice (keeps the disks
from filling up).
