Can you try to figure out where in between 2.6.8->2.6.9 things broke? Even 
just a fairly simple binary search on the nightly snapshots should get you 
pretty easily down to within one day or so..
Most people don't have tga hardware. I don't think even most alpha users 
have it, and I think it's unheard of outside of alpha. So I'm afraid that 
there's not a lot of people around who can debug it without having a very 
clear starting point..
