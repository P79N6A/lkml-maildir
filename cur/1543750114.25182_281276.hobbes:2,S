I use it whilst on travel too, however i do not have a similar problem as 
described by James but i've noticed that simple operations like `bk vi 
filename` take extremely long;
zwane@r3000 ~ {0:0} bk version

My hostname is fixed, i do not have a default gateway set and none of the 
nameservers listed in /etc/resolv.conf are reachable. This could very well 
be a local configuration problem but you did ask for people who use BK 
disconnected to stand up =)
Thanks,
