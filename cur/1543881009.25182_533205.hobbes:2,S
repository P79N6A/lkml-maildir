Hi Ingo,
I'm replying to your 3 mails at once.

So as you've noticed just one minute after I put it there, I've updated
the tool and renamed it ocbench. For others, it's here :
    
http://linux.1wt.eu/sched/
Useful news are proper positionning, automatic forking, and more visible
progress with smaller windows, which eat less of X ressources.
Now about your idea of making it report information on stdout, I don't
know if it would be that useful. There are many other command line tools
for this purpose. This one's goal is to eat CPU with a visual control of
CPU distribution only.
Concerning your idea of using a signal to resync every process, I agree
with you. Running at 8x8 shows a noticeable offset. I've just uploaded
v0.4 which supports your idea of sending USR1.

It has annoyed me a bit too, but I'm no X developer at all, so I don't
know at all if it's possible nor how to do this. I know that my window
manager even adds title bars to xeyes, so I'm not sure we can do this.
Right now, I've added a "-B <border size>" argument so that you can
skip the size of your title bar. It's dirty but it's not my main job :-)
Thanks for your feedback
Willy
