I'd hate to see 2.4.0 going out without urbs, because that would mean
that audio would not work in any of 2.4.X. If 2.4.0 goes out with
urbs, it still may have minor implementatino problems, but we can fix
that in 2.4.X series, and 2.4.5 will have rock-solid usb with audio
working. [BTW urbified uhci works pretty well for me. I see some
problems with audio (oops after hour of usage), but that's way better
than old usb where audio just do not work. ACM and printer work in
both versions well.]
