Aha, you have an IBM A20 (or similar). You are not the first one to
report this, and indeed this happens on my T20, even under Windows.
Given that, I would suspect this is a side effect of some unknown IBM
BIOS enhancement, so I don't know what we can do without IBM telling us
more about what's going on.
