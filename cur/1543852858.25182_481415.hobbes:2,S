Hi,
As the subject says, the mouse button emulation for the one-button mouse
Apple machines isn't restricted to older ADB based machines.
I have a PPC Powerbook where the keyboard and the mouse are no longer on
the ADB bus but regular USB, and I still like (and need) to be able to
emulate the middle mouse button with F11 and the right mouse button with
F12.
Stelian.
