Oh great, you have just discovered the reason, why my driver is working
on my Pentium1-PC but not on my Pentium4-PC. It's simply not supported
by hardware.  I've spent hours and hours about this. :)
My device is actually using DTR and RTS. What line could I use instead of
TxD? Is it possible to use CTS for this, although it is normally a
"input-signal", but not a "output-signal" like RTS?
