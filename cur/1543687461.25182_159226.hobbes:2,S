That's an old Jedi mind trick, dating back at *least* as far as the IBM 3350
disk drive from 1976 (the 23xx drives from the S/360 and the 3330/3340 series
had single heads per surface) .  8 14" platters, 317.5M.  16 physical surfaces,
but it reported 30 heads, because each arm had an "inside" and "outside" head :
====\=====\   (arm)
        =================| (platter)
====/=====/   (arm)
The outside heads were tracks 0-15 and servo-1, the inside heads were 16-29
and servo-2.  It was also available with a second fixed-access arm that had enough
heads to read the first 5 cylinders without seeking at all - so that's another 150
heads.  So that gets us to 180... not *quite* 240, but....
And it wasn't 5 foot tall, by a long shot:

The last picture has guys standing around a string of 3350 disk drives (the
actual drive was contained in the white head, the blue bottom part was power
supplies and control logic and the like).
