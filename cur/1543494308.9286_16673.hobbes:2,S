I recently sent in a patch for the PixelView PlayTV PRO tv tuner card. A
friend went and bought the model below it - the PixelView PlayTV - and
discovered the patch does not work with older models. After some mucking
about I've found an audiomux setting that satisfies both cards.
So here's the patch. This works for both FM/TV with the PRO, and TV only
for the model below (which has no FM tuner).
