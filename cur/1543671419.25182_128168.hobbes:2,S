Hi,
Our checker finds an inconsistencies in this function. For case branch
"VIDIOCSCAPTURE" and "VIDIOCGCAPTUER", copy_from_user is called on
argument "arg", which implies arg is a user-pointer. The checker isn't
smart enough to figure out if the dereferences in other branches are
errors or the copy_*_user calls are errors.
I checked videodev.h, where VIDIOCGCAPTURE and VIDIOCSCAPTUER are defined
as _IOR ... and _IOW. does that mean the copy_from_user calls on case
branch VIDIOCGCPAUTER and VIDIOCSCAPUTER are on kernel pointers?
