Sorry James, we were talking about hard realtime. Read the thread.
What's more, I don't think you understand how a nanokernel solution
would work, nor have much idea about the complexity of implementing
it in Linux (although that could have been a result of your thinking
that we weren't talking about hard-rt).
And my questions for which I got no answer were things like
"why is a single kernel superior to a nanokernel for hard-RT?",
"what deterministic services would a hard-RT Linux need to provide?"
So most of what you said is irrelevant, but I'll pick out a few bits.

No, that wasn't part of any of my hole shooting. I asked what operations
need to be realtime and have not had an answer. fork/exec was "prompting".

Err, your example was "reading a configuration file". Not exactly
rocket science my good man.

You say this like you have a confabulous solution ready to plonk
into the Linux kernel.
But it is not up to me to point out why one way is better than the
other because I am not asking to have anything merged (not saying
*you* are either, I joined this thread by asking an open ended
question).

I have a better idea. I won't read up on any of that, and I will go
and do my own thing and stop wasting my time on this thread. Then
whoever wants to start putting hard realtime functionality into Linux
can *tell* me why nanokernels failed, OK? Let's end the discussion
until then. It is going nowhere.
