I agree.

That's sort of what libhugetlbfs
(
http://sourceforge.net/projects/libhugetlbfs
 for stable releases,
http://libhugetlbfs.ozlabs.org/
 for development snapshots/git tree) is
for; while it currently only tries to abstract/provide functionality
via hugetlbfs, that's mostly because that is the only interface
available (or was, pending some sort of char dev being merged).

libhugetlbfs is available for both SLES10 and RHEL5.

I agree. There is simply some functionality that is *very* closely
tied to the kernel.

That sounds like a good idea. For this hugetlb stuff, though, I plan
on simply taking advantage of /dev/hugetlb (or whatever it is called)
if it exists, and otherwise falling back to hugetlbfs (which
admittedly requires some admin intervention (mounting hugetlbfs,
permissions, and such), but then again, so does using hugepages in the
first place (either at boot-time or via /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages)).
Is that what you mean by available to 2.6.18 (falling back to
hugetlbfs) and 2.6.22 (using the chardev)?
> Am I wrong?
I don't think so. And hugepages are hard enough to use (and with
enough architecture specific quirks) that it was worth creating
libhugetlbfs. While having some nice features like segment remapping
and overriding malloc, it is also meant to provide an API that is
useful for general use of hugepages: we currently export
gethugepagesize(), hugetlbfs_test_path() (verify a path is a valid
hugetlbfs mount), hugetlbfs_find_path() (gives you the hugetlbfs
mount) and hugetlbfs_unlinked_fd() (gives you an unlinked file in the
hugetlbfs mount).
Then again, maybe I'm missing some much bigger picture here and you
meant something completely different -- sorry for the noise in that
case :/
Thanks,
Nish
