That's not the same thing. It's like saying "My footbrake grabs so I'll use 
the handbrake all the time. Take the stone out of the brake pad! :)

Isn't this scary? I'm agreeing with Pavel and the two of us seem to be 
disagreeing with everyone else!
To get more serious and practical though, I think the solution is to fuzz the 
userspace/kernelspace distinction. What we really want to do is freeze things 
that submit I/O, then sync, then freeze anything that processes I/O and needs 
to be frozen. In effect, redefine fuse processes as freezeable kernel 
threads.

Nigel
