I think it would be better to pass an argument to scripts/kallsyms (like 
-0 or something) that instructed it to generate the same file it usually 
generates but without any actual symbol information.
This way it will be easier to maintain this code in case new symbols are 
needed in the future. Having this done in the Makefile means that to add 
a new symbol we will have to change scripts/kallsyms, kernel/kallsyms 
and a not so clearly related Makefile.
I'll try to make a small patch if I can get some time (maybe later this 
week).
