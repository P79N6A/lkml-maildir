How about mounting the big volume somewhere and using -o bind to mount 
some paths within it in different places of your needs ? I know that -o 
bind doesnt honor -o ro yet but if you really needed maybe you can make a 
patch for that, I for one would be very interested about that.
check "man mount" about more information about "bind"
Also notice that linux (starting with some 2.3.x version if I remember 
well) already supports multiple mount points for a given "source" like
mount /dev/hda1 /mnt1
mount /dev/hda1 /mnt2 and so on
