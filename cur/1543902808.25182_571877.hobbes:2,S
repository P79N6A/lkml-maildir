The Xen sched_clock implementation is very similar, and it seems to work
well.

Runn*ing*?  Does it include time the VCPU spends idle/blocked?  If not,
then the scheduler won't be able to tell how long a process has been
asleep.  Maybe this doesn't matter (I had this problem in a version of
Xen's sched_clock, and I can't say I saw an ill effects from it).
