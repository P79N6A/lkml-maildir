This sounds like get_unmapped_area() is now doing more than it says on the
tin.  As I understand it, it's to be called to locate an unmapped area when
one wasn't specified by MAP_FIXED, and so shouldn't be called if MAP_FIXED is
set.
Admittedly, on NOMMU, it's also used to find the location of quasi-memory
devices such as framebuffers and ramfs files, but that's not a great deviation
from the original intent.
Perhaps a change of name is in order for the function?

That makes it sound like there should be an "unget" too for when an error
occurs between ->get_unmapped_area() being called and ->mmap() returning
successfully.
