But if you don't require a lot of higher order allocations anyway, then
guest fragmentation caused by ballooning doesn't seem like much problem.
If you need higher order allocations, then ballooning is bad because of
fragmentation, so you need memory unplug, so you need higher order
allocations. Goto 1.
Balooning probably does skew memory management stats and watermarks, but
that's just because it is implemented as a module. A couple of hooks
should be enough to allow things to be adjusted?
