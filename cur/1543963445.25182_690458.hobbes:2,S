Yes. Exactly correct.

Ooop.  Sorry my typo.  DS2756.

There is no final value. Only relative values.  The EC can detect the 
ends of the spectrum.  Battery empty and battery full.  At those 
endpoints it sets the SOC% to x% (exact x varies depending on the 
battery type) But lets use full and 90% as the example.
So you charge the battery until the criteria for a full battery are met 
and then you set the SOC% to 90%.  This value is stored in the EEPROM of 
the DS2756.   So then when the EC senses that the battery is discharging 
it monitors the relative ACR change.  It uses that to compute how much % 
loss and updates the SOC%.  If you are partially discharged and Ext 
power is provided so that the battery begins to charge then the reverse 
happens.  The absolute value of the ACR is never used. Only the 
difference.  The corrections of any errors happen when the full or empty 
conditions are met.

Ours is the same way.  The EC just does the extra work to keep an SOC% 
value.

Ah.. I see now.  You are using the ACR directly as the SOC value. 
Whereas OLPC does not.
If your battery capacity stays reasonably constant across the operating 
temp range then I see how that would work fine.  With NiMh chemistry the 
capacity changes quite a bit wrt temperature. Li chemistries capacity 
are much less temp sensitive.
I can't say for certain because I didn't do the original code design but 
from what I see in the EC code it tries to compensate for that capacity 
change when using NiMh.  So they record the net ACR change and use that 
to try and compute the real SOC% change.  I suppose you could still make 
it work with just the ACR register but thats not how Quanta chose to do 
the implementation.

That would work fine.
