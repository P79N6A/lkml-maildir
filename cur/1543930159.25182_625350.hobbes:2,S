i have a fully automated bootup-hang bisection script. It is based on 
"git-bisect run". I run the script, it builds and boots kernels fully 
automatically, and when the bootup fails (the script notices that via 
the serial log, which it continuously watches - or via a timeout, if the 
system does not come up within 10 minutes it's a "bad" kernel), the 
script raises my attention via a beep and i power cycle the test box. 
(yeah, i should make use of a managed power outlet to 100% automate it) 
So i dont have to a single manual decision anytime during the bisection. 
But the scripts are very much tied to my ad-hoc test environment so it 
would not be of much general use.
