Subject: [2.6.22.2 review 25/84] firewire: fw-sbp2: set correct maximum payload (fixes CardBus adapters)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Stefan Richter <stefanr@s5r6.in-berlin.de>
As far as I know, all CardBus FireWire 400 adapters have a maximum
payload of 1024 bytes which is less than the speed-dependent limit of
2048 bytes.  Fw-sbp2 has to take the host adapter's limit into account.
This apparently fixes Juju's incompatibility with my CardBus cards, a
NEC based card and a VIA based card.
Backport of commit 25659f7183376c6b37661da6141d5eaa21479061.
