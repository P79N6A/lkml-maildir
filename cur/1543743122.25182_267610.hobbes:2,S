I've tried (under 2.6.10-rc1-mm1, that was the kernel that showed me problems) 
and in fact I can plug/unplug without problems usb flash drive, but there is 
a difference with previous behaviour (apart from crash, of course :) )
here the log from patched version of ub.c:

but at this point no device is created in /dev, while previous behaviour was 
different:

i.e. no lines like

Apart that, removal of the usb device causes no harm to the system, log here:
