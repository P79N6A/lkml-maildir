Steven,
I see you tried using gdb, maybe a tool I wrote could help you:
   
http://jeanmarc.saffroy.free.fr/kdump2gdb/
Basically it will convert the kdump core to a slightly different core that 
is suitable for gdb, as well as a gdb script that loads kernel modules at 
the right offsets. Then maybe you can grab a backtrace of the faulting 
process ("bt full" can be nice) and post it to l-k.
Cheers,
