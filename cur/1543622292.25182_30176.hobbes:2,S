When does the OS/Protocol offload this task?
I can help with transport layer only -- checkumming  of the transport
protocol packet is done by transport protocol -- for instance see udp.c :
udp_getfrag (for sending). So you must came up with a nice design to do it
in hardware instead (ie. without messing with the transport layer too
much). Hope this helps, although there is obviously more to do on other
layers.
