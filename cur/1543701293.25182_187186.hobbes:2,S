Of course different things may happen depending on what's using the 
device, but IME I've never seen the OS give a STOP error from that.

If you go through all the work to get Windows to use a system file from 
  removable device then pull it out while using it, you deserve what you 
get. The only thing you could do is page in the entire system file if 
you notice it's on a removable device then put a copy in swap for the 
case that someone pulls it out, but I don't think the special case would 
be worth it on Windows or Linux. Not that I have any proof Windows 
doesn't attempt to do that already =)

I know, but I felt like mentioning the rest because it's relevant to a 
number of people on the list.
