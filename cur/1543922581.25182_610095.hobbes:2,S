It would depend on how the BIOS programmed the memory controllers.  For 
32-bit (and lots of device) compatibility, a memory hole is required 
below 4 GB.  Not all memory controllers can remap memory in the 3-4 GB 
range above the 4 GB memory; I'm not sure if that varies with the 
different Opteron processors.
Also, if you run a 32-bit distribution, you need to have HIGHMEM_64G 
enabled in the kernel.
