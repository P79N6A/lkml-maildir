The only thing that matters is the hardware s/g list capabilities. 
Driver complexity is irrelevant.

This code is completely bogus and wrong (not your fault, but still). 
Take a look at tg3.c for the right way to do it.
The driver continues to have obvious 64-bit issues that your patch 
doesn't address.  Your main test platform should really be a 32-bit 
system with PAE, and >4GB of RAM.
