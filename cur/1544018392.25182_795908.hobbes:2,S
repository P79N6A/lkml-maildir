Here you go:
$ make iptunnel.o
cc -D_GNU_SOURCE -O2 -Wall -g  -I. -idirafter ./include/ -Ilib   -c -o
iptunnel.o iptunnel.c
In file included from /usr/include/linux/if_tunnel.h:5,
                 from iptunnel.c:39:
/usr/include/linux/ip.h:85: error: redefinition of 'struct iphdr'
$ grep -r iphdr /usr/include/
/usr/include/netinet/ip.h:struct iphdr
/usr/include/netinet/tcp.h: * This should be defined as MIN(512, IP_MSS
- sizeof (struct tcpiphdr)).
/usr/include/linux/if_tunnel.h:    struct iphdr        iph;
/usr/include/linux/ip.h:struct iphdr {
$ grep netinet/ip.h iptunnel.c
#include <netinet/ip.h>
So linux/ip.h is clashing with glibc(2.8)'s netinet/ip.h
