I have an inkling that the xen implementors may have plots of
additional architecture ports. If it really is x86/x86-64 -only it
isn't worth bothering with a separate arch/ dir, but it would be if it
were ported to a large number of architectures.
Maybe they're modelling it after UML which has its own arch/ dir but
then grabs assorted things from other architectures; in that event I
wouldn't consider it so misguided.
Probably best if the implementors chimed in about all this.
