Fellow developers,
I'm gaving the following problem with a SCSI driver I'm writing. 
I have had the driver running fine for some time on a uniprocessor machine, but the smp kernel is still giving me headaches. 
I get a:
  Kernel panic: Inactive in scsi_request_queueable
  In interrupt handler - not syncing
panic after a moderate amount of I/O (namely couple of thousand
of writes to a raw disk device).
I'm running stock RedHat 6.0 with 2.2.5-15smp kernel on a Dell 
PowerEdge 1300 with 2x500Mhz PIIIs.
Before I dive into the kernel scsi code I wanted to see if anyone 
had an idea on what might be going afoul. 
cheers
