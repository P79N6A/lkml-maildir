I'd have thought so.

Maybe.  Sometimes it's just a matter of running the code twice - first pass
is allocate-stuff mode, second pass is use-stuff mode.

That is presently true, as long as the amounts being allocated are small
enough.

No new __GFP_NOFAILs, please.
The fact that the CPU addition will succeed, but it'll run forever more
with load balancing disabled still seems Just Wrong to me.  We should
either completely succeed or completely fail.
