In *theory* the OHCI driver is doing everything right - its asking for DMAable memory and using it. if the DMA api simply understood the device in question, and alocated accordingly, it would just work.
there are two solutions:
1) Break up the OHCI driver and make it into a chip driver as you describe
2) Make the DMA API do the right thing with these devices
1) means everyone gets to write their own allocator - not pretty
2) means we get to share code and it all just works.
