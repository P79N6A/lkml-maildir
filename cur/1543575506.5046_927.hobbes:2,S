Hello,
   I also received this error:
ohci1394.c:1588: structure has no member named 'next'
make[2]:*** [ohci1394.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory '/usr/src/linux/drivers/ieee1394'
...
Its the same case with drivers/i2o/i2o_lan.c
I suspect there are more. Is there a simple patch that will fix all affected drivers?
Regards,
Frank
