Subject: [PATCH 0/10] make link target handling more robust
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

These patches fix potential bugs associated with link target handling,
primarily by NUL-terminating names read from disk.
This is version 5 of these patches. This version fixes an off-by-one
bug, pointed out by Andreas Dilger, where the maximum name length was
calculated with sizeof without leaving space for the terminator.
This set includes patches for all affected filesystems except for jfs,
which has already been fixed by David Kleikamp, and ufs, where I am
still discussing some issues with the maintainer. I'll post the ufs
patch separately once it is ready.
The eCryptFS fix should be considered for stable.
