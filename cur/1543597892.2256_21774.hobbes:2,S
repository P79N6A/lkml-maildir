At first, I tried it with 2.4.9-pre4 and udf-0.9.4.1.
I did not get segv nor Oops with them.
But it seems bad yet.
My operations are here.
# mkudf /dev/hdb
# mount -t udf /dev/hdb /mnt/floppy/
# cp -auv ~/dir /mnt/floppy/ 1> /tmp/cp.log 2> /tmp/cp.log &
"cp" seems good until following "df" point.
/dev/hdb               4470016   1639798   2830218  37% /mnt/floppy
After that point, "tail -f /tmp/cp.log" shows "cp going :-)" and
my DVD-RAM driveseeks like working good.
But result of "df" command is not change. 
(it shows 37% forever...)
"df -i" shows
/dev/hdb             1440735   25626 1415109    2% /mnt/floppy
tails of dmesg are;
UDF-fs INFO UDF 0.9.4.1-rw (2001/06/13) Mounting volume '', timestamp 2001/08/16 21:54 (121c)
hdb: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }

hdb: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hdb: ATAPI reset complete
hdb: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hdb: ATAPI reset complete
hdb: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hdb: ATAPI reset complete
hdb: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }

I will try with CVS udf patch and will report it.
