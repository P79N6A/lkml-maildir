The symbols are exported to support the vm_enough_memory hook functions
in the security modules.  We had originally (in 2.5) only proposed
replacing the CAP_SYS_ADMIN check in the old vm_enough_memory function
with a security hook so that SELinux could handle it differently than
other CAP_SYS_ADMIN checks (in particular, to avoid spuriously auditing
CAP_SYS_ADMIN denials generated by the check), but Alan Cox had
suggested moving the entire vm_enough_memory logic into the security
modules to support future implementation of policies such as role-based
commit constraints.  Unless you envision introducing a different
max_map_count for privileged processes, I'm not sure it is worthwhile to
introduce a hook for the map_count check or to export this symbol to
modules.  I've cc'd the LSM maintainer as well to see if he has a
different view.
