1. And now kernel should wait for modprobe to respond :-) modprobe is not in
kernel anyway (and does not belond there IMO).
2. How about accessing of /dev/printer/0 when printed module is NOT in memory
and so /dev/printer/0 is NOT there ?

But I can not see how kmod changed it: you still should wait for vfat.o to
be loaded by modprobe before mount() can be completed...

When someone tries to access device for which module is not loaded kernel code
SHOULD wait for the user-space process to answer "which module should be loaded
for this device to appear in /dev". No, it's two-way process :-(

Unfortunatelly it's not so: you CAN do thing with user-space daemon not even
imaginable with kernel-only devfs but you also CAN NOT do some things already
done in Richard's devfs.

IDEA behind of devfs is NOT IDEA of a dynamic /dev directory. It's idea that
/dev should be what name implies: direct link to device drivers. That is
without any indirect major/minor numbers and such.

Hmm. What'll be registered in such a list ? IMO some "default" name of device
SHOULD be supplied by device driver. So when you got driver for brand new
device for which there are no information in userspace daemon such device
still can be used somehow (even if name for such device will be ugly). Or that
or each driver should come with some configuration file for every possible
userspace daemon. BTW HOW userspace daemon should distinguish different drivers
if there are neither major/minor numbers nor names ? If such names should
appear in /dev without modifications is other story completely...

We should support not only brand-new plug-n-pray buses but also old devices
like non IEEE whateveer-conforming printers (or IEEE-whatever conforming
printers turned off while system bootup :-) printers and such. Where you just
have no information about device before user first time tries to access it.

Looks like a plan :-)
