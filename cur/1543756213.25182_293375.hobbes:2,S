If I understand your workload right, it should consist mainly of
computation, networking (?), and disk reads.
I don't know much about ReiserFS, but in some experiments with ext3,
using ABISS, we found that a reader application competing with best
effort readers would experience worst-case delays of dozens of
milliseconds.
They were caused by journaled atime updates. Mounting the file
system with "noatime" reduced delays to a few hundred microseconds
(still worst-case).
