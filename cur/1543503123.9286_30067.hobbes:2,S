Hi,
I think I found a bug in the linux signal handling. In the manual page of
sigaction I can find the following:
       sa_mask  gives  a  mask of signals which should be blocked
       during execution of the signal handler.  In addition,  the
       signal which triggered the handler will be blocked, unless
       the SA_NODEFER or SA_NOMASK flags are used.
This lets me think that SA_NODEFER has only an effect on the sent signal,
but in arch/i386/kernel/signal.c:handle_signal() I find the following:
        if (!(ka->sa.sa_flags & SA_NODEFER)) {
                spin_lock_irq(&current->sigmask_lock);
                sigorsets(&current->blocked,&current->blocked,&ka->sa.sa_mask);
                sigaddset(&current->blocked,sig);
                recalc_sigpending(current);
                spin_unlock_irq(&current->sigmask_lock);
        }
This means to me, that sa_mask is completly ignored, if SA_NODEFER is set.
Now my problem is how this should really work? BTW In 2.0 you can find
something similiar. 
bye, Roman
