I thought that should be done in arch/*/kernel/time.c ...
If the kernel doesn't know the RTC you have, hwclock will have 
trouble as well I guess.

I could resist the temptation to look at the code so far, and I bet 
the thing can be significantly improved if I look at it.  But for the 
time I know enough products and sources...

Think real: How mayn users would do that, and even if they do, what's 
wrong setting the time to the correct value after your tests? Still, 
I see no problem if the update is optional. Ther framework already 
exists.

Yes, but you can separate essence from bloat.

As long as mounts are local, the timezone should be obvious. Why 
duplicate the information?

That's your opinion.

I'm not convinced timezone is not a number.

I'm afraid my English is not good enough to comprehend.
