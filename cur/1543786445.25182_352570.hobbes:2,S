I have seen this couple of times when I would eject my prism54 card at
a "bad" time - my card sometimes gets stuck (a known problem with some
prism54 cards) and if I would eject it "too early" I would lose keyboard.
So I wait till it complain: 
	prism54: Your card/socket may be faulty, or IRQ line too busy :(
and eject and insert it again and all is fine.
