2.2.0-pre6 I cannot reproduce it with my disk access test.  2.2.0-pre7 I
can easily do it with.  Do you have a way to reproduce it reliably?  It'd
be handy to pin it down further.

Odd, I can do it without a network.  All it takes for me is a
multi-threaded program that thrashes into swap.  It might not even have to
be multi-threaded but GIMP v1.1.5 with MP works quite reproducibly for me.
Since I get 'hdc: lost interrupt' messages also, I suppose it's probably a
generic IRQ thing that would explain why network traffic does it for you
and hard drive access does it for me.
