Oddly I've seen the same thing off-and-on for quite some time now
(early 2.6.x or beofe, I can't be sure).  For me it affects all tty's.

For me I see this on all tty's most (but not all) of the time.

When (ie. during the 'dead time') I see this the tty isn't used by
anyone and even more rarely the tty will get stuck so that when init
gets around starting a getty, it exits immediately and then init
rate-limits by noy respwaning a console for 5 minutes.
I'm not sure who is to blame here, it looks like some tty's get into a
state that either init or the getty doesn't like and don't want to
come unstuck easily (stty sane > /dev/tty<foo> sometimes helps).
I need to get an init working as pid != 1 with debugging so I can
figure out what init thinks here.  I've just been so short of time.
