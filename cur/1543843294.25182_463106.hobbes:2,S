glibc would be happy with anything it got; if you grabbed all 3 TLS 
slots it would probably be upset.

Presumably.

Eh?  You mean there's no "allocate and return TLS slot #N" operation?  
No, but all the TLS slots should be interchangeable.  Once you've got 
your entry numbers and worked out your selector values, you can just use 
them.

The kernel reserves 3 slots in the GDT for usermode use, which are 
per-thread.  If you want more segment descriptors, you can always 
allocate an LDT.

man set_thread_area has this as paragraph 2:
       When  set_thread_area() is passed an entry_number of -1, it uses a free
       TLS entry. If set_thread_area() finds a free TLS entry,  the  value  of
       u_info->entry_number  is  set  upon  return  to  show  which  entry was
       changed.
which seems pretty clear to me.  A quick run with strace on any binary 
shows this in action:
    set_thread_area({entry_number:-1 -> 6, base_addr:0xb7fb06c0,
    limit:1048575, seg_32bit:1, contents:0, read_exec_only:0,
    limit_in_pages:1, seg_not_present:0, useable:1}) = 0
