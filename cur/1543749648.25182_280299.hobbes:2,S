Rik's patch was broken (word-wrap by pine), but I patched
manually.  However, I have tglx-oom-final patch which moved
out_of_memory call from vmscan.c:try_to_free_pages()
to page_alloc.c:__alloc_pages().
Basically, (sc.nr_congested < SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX) check is missing.
So, what's the best way to combine these two patches?
If you use mutt, the patch can be found with command
/~i 1102697553.3306.91.camel@tglx.tec.linutronix.de
from your LKML mailbox.
