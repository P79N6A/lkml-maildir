Last time I checked pci_dma_sync was meant to sync the mapping when 
ownership gets transferred from busmaster to cpu, i.e. after hardware 
used/modified the buffer. What about the other direction when the cpu 
filled a reused streaming map to device and wants to pass ownership to the 
busmaster - we need to flush cpu caches to make sure the busmaster sees 
the modified data.

Did I miss something?
