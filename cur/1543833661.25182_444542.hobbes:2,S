This drive model surely supports S.M.A.R.T. but maybe support in the
driver is still underway. I just did a 
# smartctl --device=ata --smart=on --offlineauto=off --saveauto=on -T permissive /dev/sdb
and this is what I got:
smartctl version 5.36 [i686-pc-linux-gnu] Copyright (C) 2002-6 Bruce Allen
Home page is 
http://smartmontools.sourceforge.net/
=== START OF ENABLE/DISABLE COMMANDS SECTION ===
SMART Enabled.
Error SMART Enable Auto-save failed: Input/output error
Smartctl: SMART Enable Attribute Autosave Failed.
SMART Automatic Offline Testing Disabled.
The funny thing is that I enabled smart on the drives themselves through
some vendor utility, so IMHO this should not be necessary. I'll try to
add the smartctl calls to init scripts and see what I can find.
Thanks a lot!
