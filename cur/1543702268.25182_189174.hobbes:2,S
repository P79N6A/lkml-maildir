Subject: [PATCH] Unaligend accesses nulldevname

Hi,
I found an excessive amount of unaligned accesses on my AXP workstation
and tracked it down to ip_packet_match() in the ip_tables module.
indev and outdev are not properly aligned if set to nulldevname in
ipt_do_table().
This destroys the benefits of comparing names in units of (long) and
on architectures with expensive unaligned accesses (such as ia64 or
alpha), it even hurts a lot.
Find attached a patch against 2.6.0. A similar patch is needed for 2.4,
also attached.
Please consider merging them.
Looking at ip_packet_match(), I have two more thoughts:
* It should not be inlined. It's too large to benefit from inlining,
  IMHO. (OTOH, it's only called from one place, so it does not
  really matter.)
* There's a comment about the compiler being able to unroll the 2/4
  (64/32bit) iter loop which is not completely appropriate: We don't
  pass -funroll-loops, so gcc does not do it :-(
  It would be beneficial though.
Regards,
