Jackson-san,
Sorry for the late reply.
I've implemented the cpumeter based on your idea with small modification
on handling meter_cpu.  To make grouping the metered cpus and nodes 
easier,  I modified your idea so that the meter_cpu file is also used for
marking the toplevel of the metered CPUSET (CPUSET 1).  The toplevel 
CPUSET (CPUSET 1) is also metered, that is different from the 
subcpuset_top file of SUBCPUSETS.

         meter_cpu=1              meter_cpu=1
         meter_cpu_*              meter_cpu_*
Here are other rules around meters:
- If meter_cpu is 1, meter_cpu_* files appear.
- The children (CPUSET 1a, 1b, 1c) inherit CPUSET 1's value of 
  cpus/mems/meter_cpu/... and do not have their specific values.
- The metered CPUSETS can have their children
  (this is not allowed in SUBCPUSETS).
- meter_cpu in the children of metered CPUSETS can not be modified
  (can not create normal CPUSETS under metered CPUSETS).
I'll send patches right after this mail.
Comments appreciated,
KUROSAWA, Takahiro
