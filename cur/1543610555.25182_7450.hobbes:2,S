Egads...  Andrea, think for a bloody minute.  What's the point of adding
a new helper that would share a lot of code with the iput() _and_ would
bring additional calling rules?  We get
	* more code in inode.c
	* more code duplications
	* a lot of opportunities to fsck up in fs code
	* redundant invalidate_inodes() calls in fs/super.c existing just
to catch these fsckups.
	* some filesystems getting out with only iput(), some needing new
helper.
	* cut'n'paste programming getting one more source of bugs to
introduce.
And it's not even the case when filesystems could use that distinction in
any sane way...
