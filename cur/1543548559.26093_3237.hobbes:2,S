It is a tty, it's just that if you open(2) it, it doesn't become
your _controlling_ tty by default. See drivers/char/tty_io.c (I
think, that's from the top of my head).
You can always force it to become the controlling tty using TIOCSCTTY,
but that is kind of hard in a shell script. But the trick with
reopening stdin/stdout/stderr using /dev/tty1 should work.
And indeed, as has been pointed out on this list, it could be
that /dev/console is actually /dev/lp0 which isn't a tty at all.
Could cause some weirdness - I never really tried it, or read that
part of the source code though
Mike.
