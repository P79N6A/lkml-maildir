Hmm, actually, its harmless to do further i/o. The s2io driver barks
(as it should) because the result of reads is always 0xffffffff.

I will try that. I was mostly concerned that s2io_card_down()
also may do some other "important" things with regards to the driver
state, things which might be needed to keep the down-up sequence
symmetrical. I wasn't sure, so I took the conservative route.

Right! Will revise this patch shortly.

Its OK on pSeries, and I beleive it will be OK on PCIE, but I do
not quite know enough about actual PCIE chipsets.
