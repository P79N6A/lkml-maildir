This behaviour is *inconsistent*. rename() affects *links*, not files.
It cannot and should not know about other links to file. Learn the OS you
are using, damnit. Learn the bloody difference between the link and file.

*One* link is always supported. You mean 2. Your proposed semantics is
*not* a semantics of hardlink.

So you are making the files with long names immutable??? Attributes belong
to *file*, not *link*.

Because the long name survived and it bloody has an 8+3 record, thus the
prohibited name. If the long name doesn't survive - you got a proof that
those are not hardlinks.
