Hi,
I noticed that LFS support has made it into 2.5, but it's not on the status
list (
http://kernelnewbies.org/status/latest.html
).
IIRC there were some plans to add oplock support to smbfs (newbie alert:
linux smb client, oplocks are already in samba server).  Maybe that should
be tracked on the status too.
