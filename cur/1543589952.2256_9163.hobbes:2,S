It's right API a bit misused (to allow your request to use fields by
name)
i.e. foo = readl((unsigned long)&regs->bar);
vs a wrong API that need a cast to be used correctly
i.e. rme9652->iobase = (unsigned long) ioremap(rme9652->port,
RME9652_IO_EXTENT);
Taken in account that the main point is to not have fake pointers here
and there, my choice would be obvious.

offset defines are never correct on some architecture while being
incorrect on some other, that's the whole point: a wrong #define is
likely squashed during the very first phase of driver development.
