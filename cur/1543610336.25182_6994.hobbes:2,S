Not to my knowledge. Since I was pretty much bitten by swap in former days I
plugged in more RAM and stopped swap completely. I must admit that it didn't
get any faster, but trashing is gone (obviously). But this is only because of
my own dumbness placing swap on the same drive as root-fs. I guess it would be
a good idea to use the former small hds (1-2 GB) for swap completely, so any
bad interaction with normal fs is omitted.
BTW maybe you should try the latest preX versions, they tend to have more
_free_ mem available and perform pretty ok on my system.

Stephan
