Ye haa!  This should be a big improvement.

I'm not sure I like or agree with this.  Shouldn't we be limiting
based on the device's capability to sustain traffic?  So if I have a
RAID device which can read/write a total of 100Mb/sec, while at the
same time I've got a CF device which can do 5Mb/sec, shouldn't we be
more strongly limiting the CF device, even if it is the only device
being written to?  
Of course, I haven't read the patches yet, nor am I qualified to
comment on them in any meanginful way I think.  Hopefully I'm just
missing something key here in the explanation.
Peter> 3 is done by also scaling the dirty limit proportional to the

Do you mean task or device here?  I'm just wondering how well this
works with a bunch of devices with wildly varying speeds.
