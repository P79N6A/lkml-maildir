I totally agree, 2-phase approach is a right way to go. However, I've been
confused by that "feature freeze" thing. ;-)
This patch has zero impact on existing code - I thought it's a "feature"
(and I still believe it's ok for 2.4).
OTOH, I've actually tried to implement 2-phase probing _inside_ the
pci_do_scan_bus, and that was ugly as hell.
I believe the phase #2 must be a separate top-level function -
something like pci_probe_resources (better naming?), but this
assumes some changes to PCI code for every architecture and hotplug
drivers.

I like the former. Even if we have to reassign the bus numbers,
we won't affect anything but forwarding the PCI configuration
cycles.
For now I'd start with following:
phase #1. pci_do_scan_bus() - build the bus/device tree, read in
          dev/vendor IDs, header type and class code; call
	  "PCI_FIXUP_EARLY" fixups.
phase #2. pci_probe_resources(bus) - walk the bus tree again,
	  probe the BARs, maybe call pci_read_bridge_bases for
	  bridges; fill in the rest of PCI header; call "PCI_FIXUP_HEADER"
	  fixups.
(Also there are phases #3 and #4 - assign resources and assign unassigned
resources, but it's another story)
Then, for example on alpha, we'll have
	/* Scan all of the recorded PCI controllers.  */
	for (next_busno = 0, hose = hose_head; hose; hose = hose->next) {
		hose->first_busno = next_busno;
		hose->last_busno = 0xff;
		bus = pci_scan_bus(next_busno, alpha_mv.pci_ops, hose);
		hose->bus = bus;
		next_busno = hose->last_busno = bus->subordinate;
+		pci_probe_resources(bus);
		next_busno += 1;
	}
Hmm, this looks good - now we can do early bus-specific fixups
without introducing "pcibios_init_bus" thing (suggested by Grant and
myself quite a while ago).
I'll try to code up all of this and do some basic testing on alpha
and i386 in next few days.
Comments?
