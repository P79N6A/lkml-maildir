find below another fix that is somewhat better as it does not affect the 
native kernel and !PARAVIRT.
btw., this also explains why this bug wasnt reported sooner against 
x86.git#testing: people done normally use PARAVIRT on 64-bit yet.
(there is no 64-bit host support)

Subject: x86: stackprotector & PARAVIRT fix
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
Date: Sat Feb 23 07:06:55 CET 2008
on paravirt enabled 64-bit kernels the paravirt ops do function
calls themselves - which is bad with the stackprotector - for
example pda_init() loads 0 into %gs and then does MSR_GS_BASE
write (which modifies gs.base) - but that MSR write is a function
call on paravirt, which with stackprotector tries to read the
stack canary from the PDA ... crashing the bootup.
the solution was suggested by Arjan van de Ven: to exclude paravirt.c
from stackprotector, too many lowlevel functionality is in it. It's
not like we'll have paravirt functions with character arrays on
their stack anyway...
