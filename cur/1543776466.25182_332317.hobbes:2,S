hm, doesnt this coincide with the pushing of some keyboard functionality 
(such as LED handling, etc.) into keventd? Keyboard stuff used to be 
done from a tasklet, but that had its own problems. Now that we use 
keventd (which is a SCHED_OTHER task) the delays seen by the keyboard 
handling path might be larger. This could both affect the hardware 
(keyboards are quite fragile), or it could also trigger some races that 
were not triggered that often with tasklets?
