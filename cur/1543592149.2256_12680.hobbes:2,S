Hi All,
  Please Apply.
  I've updated the patch that I had posted on Monday so it applies against
2.4.4-ac15, with -p1. 
  Rather than spam the list the patch is at 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/tgall/patch-lpar-dev-vs-2.4.4-ac15.gz
  The major / minor numbers in the patch were approved by hpa before the freeze
so hopefully there isn't an issue with these drivers going in on that account.
  Thanks!
  Tom
