We are definitely going to see systems like this, and the DMA issue
will be taken care of by the PCI host controller, it will either pull
out all queued up DMA writes by the device in question itself
(somehow) or require the driver for the PCI host controller do a dummy
read out to the device before servicing an interrupt handler to
guanentee this semantic.
We already have pre-PCI-E controllers on sparc64 where I have to do a
dummy config space read to pull out all the pending DMA requests
before servicing an interrupt, so this kind of scheme would be nothing
new.
People are going to use PCI-E on very inexpensive and primitive cpu
platforms.
The thing to do for such platforms is the use virtual IRQ numbers and
interrogate the PCI-E controller for the MSI number when the CPU level
interrupt arrives and translate that into the appropriate virtual IRQ.
