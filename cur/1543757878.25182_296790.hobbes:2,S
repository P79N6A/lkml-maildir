I can't really speak for Fedora RC3 kernels,
perhaps there's some special patch in there that happens to
trigger it for you, but certainly there have been occasional
other reports of this BUG with vanilla kernel.org kernels.

It's odd that you get no more lines, but it doesn't really
matter in this case.  Sadly, the debug info accompanying this
BUG has done very little to shed light on its causes (and it's
on my todo list to change it to something less of a hindrance).

Downgrading to 2.4 will most certainly stop that particular
BUG, since 2.4 has no equivalent.  But it won't necessarily
fix the underlying issue.

The first thing to do is to give memtest86 a good (say
overnight) run.  Many of the rmap.c BUG reporters have
subsequently found memtest86 failures, and we believe those
instances are accounted for by bad memory.  And if that's so
in your case, you don't really want to be running 2.4 on it.
But not all cases could be accounted in that way.  If you
report back that memtest86 ran cleanly, then I'll have to
rework a debug patch against your Fedora RC3 kernel to try
to give us more info - though quite possibly you cannot afford
such experiments on this server, and will revert to 2.4 for now.
