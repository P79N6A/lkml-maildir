Doesn't work here.  Without ulimit, I wasn't surprised
about the resulting OOM mess. 
Problem was, it never stopped.  I expected OOM to kill
this program, and quite possibly lots of other running programs
as well.  What I got, was ever-rolling OOM messages
with stack traces inbetween. 
2.6.18-rc4-mm1 never recovered and had to be killed by sysrq.
