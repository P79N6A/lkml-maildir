Go to linux/fs/fat, edit inode.c, comment the bit
        if (FAT_FIRST_ENT(sb, media) != first
            && (media != 0xf8 || FAT_FIRST_ENT(sb, 0xfe) != first)) {
                if (!silent) {
                        printk(KERN_ERR "FAT: invalid first entry of FAT "
                               "(0x%x != 0x%x)\n",
                               FAT_FIRST_ENT(sb, media), first);
                }
                goto out_invalid;
        }
out by putting #if 0 ... #endif around it.
How was this card formatted?
