I think I see driverfs as the solution here.  Topology is deduced by examining 
certain device and HBA parameters.  As long as these parameters can be exposed 
as nodes in the device directory for driverfs, a user level daemon map the 
topology and connect the paths at the top.  It should even be possible to 
weight the constructed multi-paths.
This solution appeals because the kernel doesn't have to dictate policy, all 
it needs to be told is what information it should be exposing and lets user 
level get on with policy determination (this is a mini version of why we 
shouldn't have network routing policy deduced and implemented by the kernel).

I've been think about this separately.  FC in particular needs some type of 
event notification API (something like "I've just seen this disk" or "my loop 
just went down").  I'd like to leverage a mid-layer api into hot plug for some 
of this, but I don't have the details worked out.

The probing issue is an interesting one.  At least SCSI has the ability to 
probe with no IO (something like a TEST UNIT READY) and I assume other block 
devices have something similar.  Would it make sense to tie this to a single 
well known ioctl so that you can probe any device that supports it without 
having to send real I/O?

Mike Sullivan (of IBM) is working with Patrick Mochel on this.
