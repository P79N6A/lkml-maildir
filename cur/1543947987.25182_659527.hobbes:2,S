But has extensive port auto-detection which seems to work great (at least on 
my card). I don't feel like porting that code to de2104x - the code looks 
complex.

So we have two unmaintained drivers - one that works fine (and is production 
quality - or at least seems to be) but does not support hotplug APIs and one 
that was never finished (the TP-unplug problem is present at least since 
2003).
Perhaps de4x5 could be ported to new API(s)? I think that it's much easier 
than fixing obscure hardware-related problems like cable auto-detection.
