Hi,
I have patches to the Linux kernel that add support for the IBM
mainframe ESA/390 series of computers (and clones e.g. Hitachi
but I don't know that anyone has yet tried that).  Although these 
are still quite raw & not exactly functional (understatement), 
I figured it might be a good time ask about incorporating these 
into the e.g. 2.3.x series of kernels.  So my big question is 
"Now What?"
A recent set of patches & more info are pointed at by
