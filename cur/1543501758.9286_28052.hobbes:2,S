I am fully aware of that.

The point here is that you should not try to use C++ features inside
the kernel, ie. things like exceptions are not meant to be used within
the kernel as you do not know what it will do to your stack etc. Again
the kernel is written in C, let it stay like that.
Forcing people to write kernel code in C like this actually prevents a
lot of nasty disasters that will be hard to debug.
