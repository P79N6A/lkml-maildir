Hello,
I'm coming into this conversation a bit late, so I might be missing
something and appologize if I am.  But  I have the same board and
experienced some intersting weirdness with PC2100 NON ECC chips on this
board as well.  I was using High performance ram from Mushkin at the
time.  Now here's the interesting part, according to some small print in
the manual, non ecc ram works up to 1.5Gb.  Knowing this, I bought 1Gb
of it, 2 512MB sticks.  I put them both in, and the board only sees
512Mb.  So I talk to Mushkin about it, apparently they've done some
testing with this board.  Non ECC memory is EXTREMELY flakey in this
board.  So flakey that Tyan, unofficially mind you, recommened to them
that they not suggest to their customers to put non ecc memory in this
board.  So I got 1Gb of ECC Registered memory, and have yet to have a
problem with it.
That's just my $.02 and I hope it helps in some way.
Oh yeah, and I am running 2.4.21 config'ed for AMD and SMP and still, no
problems.
