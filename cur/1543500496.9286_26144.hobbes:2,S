kassert() is a nop in release builds, so kassert() can't be used

I don't think that special purpose macros should be added to
<linux/kdebug.h>, instead it provides a framework and 
you must use #ifdef CONFIG_KDEBUG if you need anything special.
[our NT driver: 1700 ASSERT() macros and 95 #ifdef BLD_DEBUG
for special checks such as debug only variables, memory corruption
tests, ...]
