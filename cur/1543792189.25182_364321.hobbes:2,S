Dear Nish,
Sorry that I cannot share the entire code as I have to face some licensing issues.
Please find the required code snapshots below. 
please ask if I have missed something ...
Please see the source code explained briefly below:-
/* my_msleep() sleep milli(msec) seconds */
void my_msleep(int msec)
{
	current->state = TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE;
	schedule_timeout((msec * HZ)/1000);
}
{
MMCSD_RESPONSE2
{
	..............
	.............
	/* gather the hardware interrupt reg status that is updated in the ISR context*/
	..............
	............
}
StandbyMMCSD(PCMMCSD pSD)
{
	do
	{
		tifm_msleep(300);
	}while(!MMCSD_RESPONSE2(pSD, 31, 31, false));
}
Code Description:
This is a part SD card Driver for 2.6.10 kernel & it works fine.
This part of the code is called in the ISR context from the bottomhalf when the SD Card is inserted to initialize the SD slot & card.
How did I diagnose the delay:
1) After inserting the card, I tried pressing the character '1' expecting the shedule_tiemout works by giving the keyboard  process its time to execute and print 1's onto the screen. Instead, I found the a BIG delay of 20 characters. i.e. 20  characters printed at once after the SD card initialization is done.
2) With debug messages immediately before & after the schedule_timeout call.
3) Commenting the schedule_timeout call.
 
Regards,
Mukund Jampala

Full code or function snippet, please.

This would be easier to diagnose if you shared all of the code you are
using *and* verified this occurred with a current kernel (2.6.10 is
old.).
Thanks,
