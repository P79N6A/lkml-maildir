Also, have you tried building with CONFIG_IPATH_CORE=y but
CONFIG_INFINIBAND=n?  It looks like it won't work, because the only
way for the build system to reach the driver source is via
obj-$(CONFIG_INFINIBAND)	+= infiniband/
in drivers/Makefile.
I'm not sure what the cleanest way to fix this.
Sorry for not noticing this sooner...
