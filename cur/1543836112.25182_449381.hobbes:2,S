Do you really get Oops with 2.6.17-final, too?
AFAIK, there was a bug in the early 2.6.17-rc regarding OSS emulation,
but it got fixed in the later rc.
The behavior of invalid O_* flag seems incompatible with the older
version.  Although I don't think it's totally wrong behavior, surely
better to keep the compatibility.  The patch below should fix it.
Thanks,
Takashi
