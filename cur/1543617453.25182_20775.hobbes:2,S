   This looks dubious but with the right results.

   The address passed back from the BIOS is a physical address. Not a bus
   address, not an ISA address. phys_to_virt I suspect is genuinely the right
   thing in this unusual case.
   
This slipped thru by accident, it is part of the "kill bus_to_virt"
stuff I'm working on with Jens.  Oops...
