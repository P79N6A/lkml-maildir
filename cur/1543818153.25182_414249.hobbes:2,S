You are right, it is block layer for I have seen problems with
vfat formatted compactflash too now.  On my home machine, the
problems are intermittent.  The hang can happen after
writing almost one GB, or it can happen early, in "mount"
I also have a via epia board that consistently fails to use
its compactflash reader, but that one is cardbus, not usb.
