Hmm, I've always been a bit curious about this .. I don't think getpid()
should return tgid instead of pid. It looks broken to me. Thread groups
are a good idea, but they should act more like process groups do.
Switching pid and tgid is something that the LinuxThreads library
should probably do, but not the kernel. IMHO.
If one really wants CLONE_PID to work, fix CLONE_PID.
