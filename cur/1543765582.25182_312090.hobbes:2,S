Jeff:
You need to add a comment about the SATAII TX2/TX4 boards indicating
users have experienced data corruption with the sata_promise driver and
the SATAII TX4 board.
I've posted several emails to linux-ide about this.  Why haven't you
responded?
Promise TX2/TX4
Summary: No TCQ/NCQ. Full SATA control including hotplug and PM on all. 
[snip]
Update 2005/04/15: Support for the NCQ-capable SATAII TX2/TX4 boards was
recently added. NCQ support is waiting on libata core.
