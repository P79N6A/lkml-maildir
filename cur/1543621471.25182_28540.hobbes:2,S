Correct me if I'm wrong, but there are express two different types of
situations, and CML1 isn't sufficient to express the second:
1) CONFIG_FOO_OPTION requires CONFIG_FOO
2) CONFIG_SUBSYS2 requires CONFIG_SUBSYS1
The reason why #2 is different, is the desired prompting and symbol
behavior for the end user.
If CONFIG_SUBSYS1=m or "", and CONFIG_SUBSYS2=y or m, then we gotta
change the value of CONFIG_SUBSYS1 and options underneath
CONFIG_SUBSYS1.  Re-prompt for CONFIG_SUBSYS1, perhaps?
If CONFIG_SUBSYS1=y, value of CONFIG_SUBSYS2 isn't affected
If CONFIG_SUBSYS1="" and CONFIG_SUBSYS2="", then we gotta prompt for
CONFIG_SUBSYS1, but -after- CONFIG_SUBSYS2 is prompted for.
I was tempted to introduce a "requires" token to express dependencies
between subsystems, because I feel they are different from the other
dependencies present,
