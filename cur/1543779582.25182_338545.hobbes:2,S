Trivial patch.  Remove redundant unlikely.
Side note. Ingo, I've also completed the softdeadlock update patch, and
I'm right now trying to trigger the kjournald deadlock by upping it to
FIFO 30 and having non RT tasks running find and compiles.  Since you
removed my inverted lock patch, this should cause the bug. This use to
cause the deadlock right away, but now I can't get it to lock.  Did you
change anything else? The jbd looks identical to 2.6.12.
