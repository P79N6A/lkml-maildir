Naaah. I included it in my module as a joke. Steve didn't take
it as a joke and forwarded it to you. It shows that the whole
MODULE_LICENSE("Whatever") is a joke. Not only that, I can
simply change /proc/sys/kernel/tainted to 0 before submitting
a bug report. This whole GPL thing has taken a real stupid
turn. I guess GNU has really taken over Linux. Stallman will
be real proud of all the work you guys did for him on
GNU/Linux .........
And, yes, we still have free speech in the US, even though
the current administration won't allow us to say anything
bad about it (treason, you know)!
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
