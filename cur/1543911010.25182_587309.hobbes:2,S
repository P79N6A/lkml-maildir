Hi, Andrew,
I see the following error while compiling on a ppc64 machine.
  CC [M]  sound/aoa/soundbus/core.o
sound/aoa/soundbus/core.c: In function ‘soundbus_uevent’:
sound/aoa/soundbus/core.c:91: error: ‘length’ undeclared (first use in this function)
sound/aoa/soundbus/core.c:91: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
sound/aoa/soundbus/core.c:91: error: for each function it appears in.)
make[3]: *** [sound/aoa/soundbus/core.o] Error 1
make[2]: *** [sound/aoa/soundbus] Error 2
The error seems to be related to recent changes to soundbus_uevent(), the length
parameter which was being filled by add_uevent_var() is now gone.
