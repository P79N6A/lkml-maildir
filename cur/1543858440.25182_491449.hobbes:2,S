this is not per se true, it depends on the capabilities of your 32 bit
x86 processor.

this shows that the *intent* is to have it non-executable. 
Not all x86 processors can enforce this. All modern ones do.

the alternative (showing effective permission) is equally confusing;
apps would see permissions they didn't set...

it's not a "32 bit" thing, it's an "older processors don't, newer ones
do" thing.
Can you paste your /proc/cpuinfo file here ? Maybe you have a processor
with the capability but just haven't enabled it (either in the bios or
in the kernel config)
