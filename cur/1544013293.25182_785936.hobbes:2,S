Please do NOT do the mistake and think this the same thing.
Rob's patch simplyfy the timecost stuff - and will be applied on
this merit alone assuming comments will be addressed.
But the serie rased anohter topic: shall we ban use of perl
for generating a kernel.
And this is what primary is discussed and the outcome of
that discussion will not prevent patches that stands on their
own to be applied.
