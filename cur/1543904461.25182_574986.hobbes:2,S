Er, so you read the readme, and then you type "make Preparation!" (which I 
wouldn't have guessed from the comment at the end of the readme), and it 
spits this to stdout.  Ok, I can add "make 'Preparation!' > lguest.txt" to my 
update script so I can mirror a copy of the output on the web.
Are there any other build targets that produce documentation which I should 
know about?
