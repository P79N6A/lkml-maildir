Right, which creates an incentive to work on it. So we then either to a
quick and ugly hack and relieve the stress and never again get around to
looking at that particular issue (because management or something
doesn't see the problem anymore) or we do the right thing and fix it
properly.
I prefer the second, but I understand its not always an option.

Hehe, I wish! its on my todo list though, along with some other things,
but very unlikely I'll ever get around to it.
The good news is that Eric Dumazet recently got rid of a few prominent
