Subject: [Patch 0/2] Disable SW irqbalance/irqaffinity for E7520/E7320/E7525

As part of the workaround for the "Interrupt message re-ordering across
hub interface" errata (page #16 in
http://developer.intel.com/design/chipsets/specupdt/30288402.pdf
),
BIOS may enable hardware IRQ balancing for Lindenhurst/Tumwater based chipset
platforms. Software based irq_balance/irq_affinity should be disabled if
hardware IRQ balancing is enabled.
This is applicable for chipsets with PCI id's
E7520, 0x3590
E7320, 0x3592
E7525, 0x359E
and with revision ID 0x09 and below.
Patch is broken into two parts.
1/2 - Set TARGET_CPUS on x86_64 to cpu_online_map. This brings the code inline
with x86 mach-default
2/2 - Add pci quirks to disable irq_balance/affinity based on the above
information and make sure destination cpus in IO-APIC redirection table
entries are set to cpu_online_map
