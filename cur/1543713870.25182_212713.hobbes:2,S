Come back when you have found out.

I would not trust anything with "rapidly changing requirements" as security
infrastructure.

A security model has to be exhaustively scrutinized, proved correct and
complete, and well-tested. The implementation language is completely
irrelevant, the hard work is _not_ programming.

In what sense?

Again, what does this mean?

What is the use of restricting access sequences? If sequence A, B, C is
forbidden, chances are that C, B, A (or any of the other 4 permutations)
will give an attacker exactly what he wants.
