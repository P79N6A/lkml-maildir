Can somebody help me with this.
I'am new to Linux normaly i do programming for RTOS.
I would like to send ethernet packets with 1400 bytes payload.
I wrote a small program witch sends a buffer of 1400 bytes in a endless 
loop.
The problem is that a would like 100Mbits throughtput but when i check this 
with ethereal.
I only get 40 MBits. I tried sending with an UDP socket and RAW socket. I 
also tried sendfile.
The RAW socket gives the best result till now 50 MBits throughtput.
Is there something faster then send or am i doing something wrong.
I'm running kernel 2.6 on a ARM9 core at 177Mhz 32RAM 32Flash.
Sorry for the bad English.
Thanks
Roy Rietveld
