The upside is since we can't it makes the implementation much easier :)

I did it only so that programs do not see inode numbers change under
them.  For the copy that gets the original inode numbers delaying
until write is fine, for the copy with the new inode numbers to avoid
surprises you need to break the cow on the directory and move it to
the files on readdir, stat, and open.

Agreed.

? The problem is lazy propagation of the cow flag.  The implementation
for ordinary files does not matter.  Only the implementation
for directories matters.

Sendfile feels about right but it has a few issues that complication
something like this.  It works on file descriptors, and it takes
a length parameter.
There is a lot of room for things to go wrong when implementing
cowlink(const char *oldname, const char *newname) in user space.
Since the semantics are a delayed sendfile in other ways sendfile
feels like a good fit.
