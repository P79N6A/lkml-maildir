another method would be to set all smp_affinity values in /proc/irq/*/
to 1 (i.e. let CPU#0 handle all IRQs), and start latencytest on CPU#1,
via 'taskset'. In theory this should ensure that no hardirq workload
runs on CPU#1 and thus ksoftirqd would not be active there either. (with
the exception of kernel timers started on that CPU, by latencytest.)
