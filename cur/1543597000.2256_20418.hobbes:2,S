  Hi, all. Version 182 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
Patch directly available from:
ftp://ftp
.??.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rgooch/v2.4/devfs-patch-current.gz
AND:
ftp://ftp.atnf.csiro.au/pub/people/rgooch/linux/kernel-patches/v2.4/devfs-patch-current.gz
NOTE: this is an important fix for people with renumbering devices in
/dev/discs or /dev/cdroms. Please test and report results to me.
This is against 2.4.7-pre6. Highlights of this release:
- Created <devfs_*alloc_major> and <devfs_*alloc_devnum>
- Removed broken devnum allocation and use <devfs_alloc_devnum>
- Fixed old devnum leak by calling new <devfs_dealloc_devnum>
- Created <devfs_*alloc_unique_number>
- Fixed number leak for /dev/cdroms/cdrom%d
- Fixed number leak for /dev/discs/disc%d
				Regards,
					Richard....
