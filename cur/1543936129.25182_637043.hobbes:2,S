I believe that I *have* seen this happen to me.  I'm using a Compaq
R3000 laptop with AMD-64 CPU and Gentoo with kernel 2.6.24-rc6-mm1.
A few days ago I crashed it twice in a row by trying to load my Comics
bookmarks as tabs (87 entries) in 32-bit Firefox.
I only got 1 and 3/4ths lines output by netconsole and it mentioned a
function with 32-something in the name.
Later tonight I can try loading the tabs in Firefox again to see if it
will reproduce for a 3rd time.
I also have to say that the NMI watchdog, supposedly Non-Maskable,
hardly *ever* works for me.  I don't believe that whatever events reset
the dog actually matter to the end user.  Perhaps its still processing
interrupts and running a timer loop but if nothing can read or write
disk, net, netlink or other device IO, I don't believe the system can
actually claim to be working.
