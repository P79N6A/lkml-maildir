The only things which users can change is low latency, the alternative
(deprecated) "38400-baud" baud rates, and the custom divisor.  None of
these depend on the low level driver, so there's no point asking the
low level driver to validate them.

Well, I'll have to read up on this before I can comment any further.
At the moment I don't feel qualified to answer your questions.
