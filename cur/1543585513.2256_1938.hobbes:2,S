It seems that having a Myrinet 2k board plugged into any slot of the second
PCI bus
of the ES40 make the system freeze with 4 GBytes of RAM when doing cat
/proc/pci.
I just plugged the board back into one slot of PCI 0 and it works again.
Why does it work with Tru64 and not with Linux ? I don't know.
Thanks to Andrea Arcangeli for helping me understand there was something
with the second PCI bus.
