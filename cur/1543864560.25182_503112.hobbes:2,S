This ladder locking is also known as lock-coupling in the database world. 
It's a good solution when you have lots of tasks and need high concurrency, 
and proven in a lot of literature. You might notice more overhead if you only 
have a small number of tasks (e.g. 2-3) but it definitely scales better than 
just holding onto one lock or a small number of locks.
