Well, winmodem case is the only I could *almost* understand 
closed-source drivers: the algorithms used *are* the modem. It's not a 
simple firmware upload.
What I really don't understand are graphic cards producers... If what 
they say about the card is true, then there's no "advanced" algorithm in 
the driver, just (at most) a firmware uploader (that's better suited 
off-kernel anyway)...
Bohf!
BYtE,
  Diego.
