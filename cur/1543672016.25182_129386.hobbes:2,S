May as well.
There's something in the driver shutdown which is failing to bring the
device into a state in which the driver startup can start it up.  Probably
just a missing device reset.  I'll bug Scott about it if we get that far.

Yes, kexec userspace shuts down the network interfaces then tries to exec
the new kernel.  But none was loaded and the syscall returns -EINVAL. 
You're left with downed interfaces.  The script should be checking the
success of the initial image loading.
