It's seems that I was experiencing hardware problems. I swapped
everything on to a new board and it worked fine. The weird thing is that
I swapped everything back and the old board now works fine now as well!
It is hard for me to imagine that reseating everything fixed it, because
I did that multiple times before.
		Thanks for all the help!

AMD's website has some documentation that says the morgan core durons
are affected. 
http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/white_papers_and_tech_docs/
26698.pdf
I am using only stock linus kernel driver for the agpgart and radeon.
Also, the system has now started locking up with 2.4.19 so I installed
WINDOWS (sorry) to see if it showed similar problems and it did (even
with the win2000 agp update). I have swaped the PS, RAM, and video card
with the same problems. I plan on swapping the MB with an identical
replacement to see if that helps. I will let you know if I conclude it
to be a hardware or software problem when I get some more parts to swap.
Sorry for bothering with what might be a hardware problem.
		Thanks for all the help!!

According to Richard Brunner of AMD's email to the list dated June 11,
2002,
the cache attribute bug only affected Athlon XPs and MPs, so that can't
be
the problem here, can it?
Cheers,
Phil
