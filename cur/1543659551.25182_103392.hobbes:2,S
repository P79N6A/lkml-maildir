Thanks.
Could I suggest appropriate updates to
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/security/linux-privs/kernel-2.4/capfaq-0.2.txt
(which caused me to waste a day or so).
I hope the people who can make such updates read this list.
I'd also appreciate pointers to other mechanisms for accomplishing the
same goals.  (And perhaps these belong in the above update too.)
Which still leaves the question of what strace has to do with it.
