None of the bugs you cite were recently introduced.

Bad idea to try this kind of argument with someone from a domain such as
holomorphy.com. Zeno's mischaracterization of limit arguments was
erroneous and furthermore is irrelevant to discrete models of phenomena,
which don't have indefinite divisibility. In fact, these quantities of
bugs correspond to natural numbers, which yield to infinite descent
arguments, and satisfy descending chain conditions of various kinds.
These are of the form "every descending chain stabilizes", a fortuitous
choice of wording on Artin's part. =)
Upgrade to the later release to get fixes for a given release. This is
not difficult to understand. No point release is "orphaned". The results
of maintaining a point release are the subsequent point releases.
You may also have to face the fact of life that you may actually have to
apply a patch to fix a bug if there's no release to move to yet.
