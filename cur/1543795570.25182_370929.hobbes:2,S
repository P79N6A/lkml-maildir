but this was in times when we did alot of nontrivial operations after we 
marked a task "dead". Today we do this:
        /* PF_DEAD causes final put_task_struct after we schedule. */
        preempt_disable();
        BUG_ON(tsk->flags & PF_DEAD);
        tsk->flags |= PF_DEAD;
        schedule();
        BUG();
(i introduced the above changes to make more of the exit path 
preemptable.)
PF_DEAD has zero relevance by today, and Oleg's patches are perfectly 
correct and dont add the kind of risk that they'd have meant in 2003.

yeah, PF_DEAD had its purpose back when we first marked a task dead, 
then we did the release_task(). We used to have problems with 
proc_pid_flush() which could sleep, which would lose the TASK_ZOMBIE or 
TASK_DEAD flag and we'd come back from the 'final' schedule().
today that's impossible, due to the code above - we only mark it PF_DEAD 
straight before going into the final schedule().
