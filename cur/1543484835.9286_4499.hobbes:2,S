Um, yes it is.  I'm running it on my 2.2.1+psaux-patch kernel as I write.
The PCMCIA drivers aren't distributed with the kernel, and it sometimes
takes a day for Dave Hinds to catch up when the kernel breaks its
interfaces; that's probably what you mean.  It's not a 'prime example'
because Dave Hinds does a stellar job of code maintenance.
