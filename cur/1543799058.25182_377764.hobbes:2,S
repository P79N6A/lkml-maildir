I'm still a bit confused why the block layer needs to know the maximum
number of hw segments. Different hardware might be connected to
different IOMMU:s, so only the driver will now how much the number can
be reduced. So the block layer should only care about not going above
max_phys_segments, since that's what the driver has room for.
What is the scenario that requires both?
