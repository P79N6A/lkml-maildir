i think this is the best option and it should give us the same /proc 
accuracy on s390 as before, plus improved scheduler precision. (and 
improved tracing accuracy, etc. etc.) Note that for architectures that 
already have sched_clock() at least as precise as the stime/utime stats 
there's no problem - and that seems to include all architectures except 
s390.
could you send that precise sched_clock() patch? It should be an order 
of magnitude simpler than the high-precision stime/utime tracking you 
already do, and it's needed for quality scheduling anyway.

i can see no real downside to it: if all of stime, utime and 
sum_exec_clock are precise, then the numbers we present via /proc are 
precise too:
   sum_exec * utime / stime;
there should be no loss of precision on s390 because the 
multiplication/division rounding is not accumulating - we keep the 
precise sum_exec, utime and stime values untouched.
on x86 we dont really want to slow down every irq and syscall event with 
precise stime/utime stats for 'top' to display. On s390 the 
multiplication and division is indeed superfluous but it keeps the code 
generic for arches where utime/stime is less precise and irq-sampled - 
while the sum is always precise. It also animates architectures that 
have an imprecise sched_clock() implementation to improve its accuracy. 
Accessing the /proc files alone is many orders of magnitude more 
expensive than this simple multiplication and division.
