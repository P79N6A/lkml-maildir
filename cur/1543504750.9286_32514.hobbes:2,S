Hi Peter,
    This looks suspiciously like a problem that was plaguing the Token Ring
code around kernels 2.2.3-2.2.8 or so.  How long does it take before you start
getting this message after you initialize your eth0 interface?  In the Token
Ring case, the problem was traced down to lots of net packets that were lying
about thier length, so when they were being free'd, they were freeing up less
space than they were actually taking, so before long there was no more real
memory available to the kernel.  You may want to take a look with a packet
sniffer to see if there are any bad packets flying around (maybe some bad
NetBUI junk or something...)
