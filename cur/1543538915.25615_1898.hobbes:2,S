I have some annoying messages in my kernel.log
IP_MASQ:reverse ICMP: failed checksum from 212.9.224.38!
IP_MASQ:reverse ICMP: failed checksum from 193.125.86.9!
IP_MASQ:reverse ICMP: failed checksum from 195.46.117.158!
IP_MASQ:reverse ICMP: failed checksum from 194.183.167.254!
What does it mean? Can i fix this problem?
