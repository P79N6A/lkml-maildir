The printout to the kernel log I attached to the previous email still 
does not mean the crash occurred there and then.

In most cases you are right, in my case, there is almost no application 
used RAM and therefore nothing to be freed.   In my particular case I 
don't *really* need memory freed, I know a little odd.
But, as this is issue is occurring with at least e1000 and tg3 the bug 
might not be in these particular drivers.   As I do not have a crash 
dump or log of what happened when the system froze, I have no way of 
knowing.
As this problem is easily reproducible, I'll leave it to the kernel 
people involved to dig into it, that is of course, if they are interested.
Thanks
