Buffered writes?  Direct writes?  Sync writes?  Log writes?
You're a bit light on details here.
Can you send the benchmark results themselves please?  (as in,
the test(s) you've run that lead you to see 6-8x, and the data
those tests produced).  Also, xfs_info output, and maybe list
the device driver(s) involved here too.
thanks!
