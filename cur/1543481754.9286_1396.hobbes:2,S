> PPP does not work on my machine (it does on kernel 2.0.36)
How about some traces, and a bit more detail - you don't even say if you
are using ppp with a modem. If you look at man pppd it'll tell you how
to turn the debug traces on - with that it may be debuggable.
Right now the only known weirdness is versus the Richochet radio modems
