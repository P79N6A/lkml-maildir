I moved it to 2.4.0-test11-pre5 (should work with pre7 too):
	
ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.4/2.4.0-test11-pre5/per-process-3.5G-IA32-no-PAE-1
It won't work with PAE enabled though (64G option). Making it to work with PAE
enabled isn't much more complicated and I'll address that later (but
in the meantime you can use it on <= 4GB RAM machines).
