yes.  looking at the source of the page over at kernelnotes, i see
that the japanese characters yield a bogus html tag (a less than
followed by random chars).  this messes up netscape 4.73.  gnus/emacs
doesn't care and i would expect most sane mailers not to care either.
i've put an underline tag into the subject to see what happens over at
kernelnotes.  i appologize for the lameness of this posting.  i hope
it doesn't clobber people's mailers.
