I've got a 3rd-gen iPod contributed to the testing stash here, but its...
Well, quirky. Was originally a 40G that someone put a 60G drive into,
and it fails to function when hooked to both a Linux box and a Mac OS X
box via FireWire, but works w/both when hooked up via USB...
In other words, its pretty much worthless for FireWire testing.

I do have a functional 2nd-gen (its Kristian's actually). From what I've
seen so far, it does work just fine w/only the 128k max req workaround
set.

So far, the 128k bit does in practice seem to be sufficient. Of course,
I haven't done anything like run iozone against this, let alone tried
shoving a bunch of music onto it...

I was able to dd the entire 2nd-gen ipod at 12.5MB/s when using just the
128k workaround (i.e. workarounds=0x101).
# dd if=/dev/sdc of=/dev/null
19531260+0 records in
19531260+0 records out
10000005120 bytes (10 GB) copied, 798.382 s, 12.5 MB/s

So far as I can decipher (using Kristian's csr-dump utility), they really
do have model_id == 0.
Would it make any sense to try keying off any additional values in the
config rom to better restrict where workarounds are applied?
Of course, there's not much to go on... The only things I can see different
between the 2nd and 3rd gen ones here are the bib header, the guid
(obviously), the unit directory length and crc and the management orb
timeout value. If the orb timeout values are consistent across the same
model, that might be the best shot...

Doesn't affect dd'ing the disk, doubtful it'd affect actual usage, unless 
someone had a completely filled iPod (workarounds=0x109).
# dd if=/dev/sdc of=/dev/null
19531259+0 records in
19531259+0 records out
10000004608 bytes (10 GB) copied, 811.963 s, 12.3 MB/s

Looks to me like the no page tables workaround isn't needed. I could
have sworn the defaults w/this patch (workarounds 0x48) was actually
causing dd to fail last night, but I haven't been able to reproduce
that failure, now that I'm trying (maybe I this ipod mixed up with one
of the others in the pile...). It certainly does slaughter performance
though. I halted this dd after getting tired of waiting:
# dd if=/dev/sdc of=/dev/null
^C1139425+0 records in
1139424+0 records out
583385088 bytes (583 MB) copied, 1220.87 s, 478 kB/s
Yeah, lets not do the no page tables workaround. :)

Can't tell, since this one doesn't behave via FireWire. Wonder if it
would behave better if I transplanted the 40G drive from a 4th-gen into
it... Where's my sledge hammer?...
