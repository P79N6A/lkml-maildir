Does this belong elsewhere? outline follows, details available.
I have a series of log entries that look like this:
	got res[xxxx:xxxx] for resource X of <device follows>
One device was the 21140 chip on my ethernet card. A few were for the
matrox video card.
Symptoms were frozen keyboard, but able to get in fro 2d system. X was
very busy (95% of CPU). Killed softare piece by piece with no change.
Killed gdm. No change.
Runlevel change to 5 got me into gnome, switching back to 3 got back the
frozen keyboard.
Reboot required.
