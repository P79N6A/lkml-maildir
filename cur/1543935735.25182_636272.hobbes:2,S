OK, please, take a look at stuff, Korean guys did 5-6 years ago. One
particular ARM port (S3C2410X) along with an ARM bootloader (vivi) was
done. Yet for some reason official Linux port has another developers, and,
it seems, it was done some time (~1-2 years) later.

IMHO, there is so much stuff done, that any brilliant C or whatever-asm
coder *have* to study at least something of it. And, in order to do a
valuable contribution, one must know the work-flow, people *and* English.
This is usually done by reading mailing list *and* archives for quite
some time. This takes time, this takes effort, but this also have huge
impact on intelligence and culture of the `coders'.
Do you ever have a question about why History exists and is studied on
all levels of education? Same with programming. Without
history-via-English, one have no strong roots, thus base for grow and
flower.
OTOH, Internet has so much noise and crap all over the place, that
information is very hard to find. It takes much time to sort and see it.
Yet, providing noise generating, like in-tree translations, seems, is a
very easy way around (not taking maintaining in account).
