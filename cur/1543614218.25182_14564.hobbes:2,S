But ... UI performance should not matter much. And that is *abuse* of

If I have a raytracer, and want to explore 8 cpus, how do I do that?
Separate scene into 8 pieces, make sure no r/w data are shared, and
clone(CLONE_VM). Are there other ways? [I do not know if people are
really doing it like that. *I* would do it that way. Is it bad?]
