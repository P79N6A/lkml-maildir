I find that it's useful when trying to work out why a thread is going
more slowly than it needs to.  Userspace tools in the CVS repository
at gelato.unsw.edu.au let you graph in real time the time spent in
each state, so you get graphs like this:

which shows mplay skipping because of a slow disk/filesystem.
Andrew> Have you any numbers on the overhead?
Around 5% on LMbench context switch numbers for uniprocessor,
negligeable on SMP (but SMP context switch results are horrible at the
moment according to LMbench2 -- almost 16usec); select on 10 fd goes
from 1.665 usec to 1.701; 
Andrew> The preempt_disable() in sys_msa() seems odd.
Yes I only added that yesterday.  It's to prevent migration while
updating the current timer.  All the other places where the current
timer are updated are naturally protected this.  It should probably be a
local_irq_disable() instead.
