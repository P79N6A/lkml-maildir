Dear All,
I'd like to announce the first release of X15 Alpha 1, a _user space_
web server that is as fast as TUX.
On my Dell 4400 with 2G of RAM and 2 933MHz PIII and NetGear 2Gbit NICs
I achieve about 2500 SpecWeb99 connections, with both X15 and
TUX (actually X15 is sligtly faster, some 20 connections more... ;)
Given the limitations of my experimental setup I'd like to ask if some
of you could help me testing my software on some higher end machines.
I'm interested to see what happens on 4-8 processors in terms of
scalability etc.
You can download X15 Alpha 1 from here:
http://www.chromium.com/X15-Alpha-1.tgz
The the README file in the tarball should contain sufficient information
to run the thing, I also included a support module for running the
SpecWeb benchmark.
TIA, ciao,
 - Fabio
