What is the reason You don't set the resched task in the fast path ?
        best_cpu = p->processor;
        if (can_schedule(p, best_cpu)) {
                tsk = idle_task(best_cpu);
                if ((cpu_curr(best_cpu) == tsk) &&
                    (cpu_resched(best_cpu) == NULL)) {
                        int need_resched;
send_now_idle:
                        /*
