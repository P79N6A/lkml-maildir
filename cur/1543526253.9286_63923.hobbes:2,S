Pretty cool :) I will have to try this one.

I have been thinking. The last email I sent about the idea of building
consoles. Well I was working on the code in my head. I realized to have
such a system would be insane. I realize how complex it would be. Your
right. A video console should be just a keyboard and a display. If a app
wants to be multihead then it should use the raw hardware devices. For
input devices its /dev/event and for displays it can be /dev/fb.

Agree. It should be a app that determines if data is shared like the
keyboard input goes to two different displays etc.

Yes the a mouse should be bound to a set of VCs. This is a little trickier
since a mouse is not required for a video terminal. Another piece of
hardware is the sound card. In a office with a multihead machine you might
have 3 sound cards in the machine. Now each person using the machine will
have headphones leading to his office. So we don't want a person blasting
his music into the other two offices. So each sound card should also be
bounded to a head.

Yep. Vojtech has already been working on this. In fact Vojtech has been
working on the input part and I have been working on the fbdev part.
