I've no idea why you'd want to do it that way, as it's simple enough
to just telnet in and type `reboot` to reset the thing...
I have my systems set up so I can log in as a specific non-root user
and the system reboots, or as a different user and the system shuts
down and powers off...
Best wishes from Riley.
