Hi Dmitry,
	I just wanted to have a single function i.e setup_sys_fs_device_files() for both
creating and removing sysfs files. So I have #defined create_sysfs_device_files() and 
remove_sysfs_device_files() and one of the arguments to the setup_sys_fs_device_files()
is a function pointer, i.e for one it takes sysfs_create_file and for other it takes
sysfs_remove_file.
Having single function for creating and removing sysfs files make it easy 
from the maintaince perspective, as oppose to remember to code for remove 
as well when one adds the new file.
thanks,
Anil
