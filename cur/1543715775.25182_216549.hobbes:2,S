I'm not sure - I'll try to find out.

2.4.24 and earlier works, but I haven't tried 2.4.25. I haven't found a 2.6 
that works but I haven't tried anything older than 2.6.5.

I'm afraid I don't have these, but will try to get them. There are no errors 
or anything out of the ordinary, it just hangs when it gets to finding the 
SCSI devices.
I've got a bug report (
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2517
) which 
has my dmesg from 2.4.24 and I've noted in it where 2.4.26 hangs.
2.6.5 (and newer) hangs in exactly the same place with either the old or new 
driver, again with no errors.
I know this is isn't a lot to go on, but it's difficult to play with it as its 
in production. Let me know what you'd like me to do next and I'll try to do 
it. Shall I compile in the driver's debugging stuff?
Thanks,
David.
