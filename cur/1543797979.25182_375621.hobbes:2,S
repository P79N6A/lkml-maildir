You will need to find out the command. Trying to arbitrate libata access
with unknown bios behaviour isn't going to have a sane resolution. There
are standard commands for this so they ought to work. If not we need to
know why, who makes the drive used etc

You probably want a low level driver that just arbitrates the interface
and implements the basic query/response transaction interface and
locking and then is called by both HDAPS and your driver (and no doubt
other future drivers talking to that controller). It can thene export
the interface to both drivers.
