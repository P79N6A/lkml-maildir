Subject: Re: [Ext2-devel] [PATCH] concurrent block allocation for ext2 against 2.5.64
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

fs/attr.c:
        if (ia_valid & ATTR_SIZE) {
                if (attr->ia_size == inode->i_size) {
                        if (ia_valid == ATTR_SIZE)
                                goto out;       /* we can skip lock_kernel() */
                } else {
                        lock_kernel();
                        error = vmtruncate(inode, attr->ia_size);
                        unlock_kernel();
                        if (error)
                                goto out;
                }
        }
so, all (!) truncates are serialized
