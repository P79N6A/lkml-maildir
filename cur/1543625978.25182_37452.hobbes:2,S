There is no mention of -b in hdparm's help screen, and in the man page 
it's only mentioned in the description of -L.
Is there a newer version of hdparm I need?

At present the system hangs if I add a master when the primary's 
present, before I get to do anything.
I've not tried adding a slave to an existing master.
As to the BIOS settings, I only configure drives required for booting. 
I've been doing that for years, before I ever used Linux, when I 
discovered that OS/2 wasn't paying attention to them. (A good thing in 
the case of OS/2 as the instructions for one of my drives gave the 
wrong geometry;-().
