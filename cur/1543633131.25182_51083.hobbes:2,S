Subject: "cannot disable RNG"?

What's the reason for such a message from Linux 2.4.18:
i810_rng: cannot disable RNG, aborting
i810_rng hardware driver 0.9.6 loaded
I tried to boot on several different mainboards, on some
I got message that the RNG has not been detected at all,
and that was right because of specific chipset parts missing.
But on boards I was told they have i810 RNG for sure I get
this message. Is there anything I should do to additionally
enable the RNG?
