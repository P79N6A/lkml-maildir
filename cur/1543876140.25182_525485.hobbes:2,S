[CRYPTO] api: scatterwalk_copychunks() fails to advance through scatterlist
In the loop in scatterwalk_copychunks(), if walk->offset is zero,
then scatterwalk_pagedone rounds that up to the nearest page boundary:
		walk->offset += PAGE_SIZE - 1;
		walk->offset &= PAGE_MASK;
which is a no-op in this case, so we don't advance to the next element
of the scatterlist array:
		if (walk->offset >= walk->sg->offset + walk->sg->length)
			scatterwalk_start(walk, sg_next(walk->sg));
and we end up copying the same data twice.
It appears that other callers of scatterwalk_{page}done first advance
walk->offset, so I believe that's the correct thing to do here.
This caused a bug in NFS when run with krb5p security, which would
cause some writes to fail with permissions errors--for example, writes
of less than 8 bytes (the des blocksize) at the start of a file.
A git-bisect shows the bug was originally introduced by
5c64097aa0f6dc4f27718ef47ca9a12538d62860, first in 2.6.19-rc1.
