Actually, CPUID reports Family 6, Model 6, Rev2, which corellates directly
to Athlon4/MP (Model 6) processors.  Whats surprising is that is doesn't
report model 7, which AMD claims is supposed to be the mobile Duron ;)..
make me wonder if it's really a neutered Athlon4.  Besides, I though the
origional mobile durons (T-bird core, model 3) didn't even support
powernow...?
FYI: This is an HP 5430 notebook.  Duron 850.

In either case, i think it really does have all these features, but feel
free to prove me wrong..

will do.  By the way, nice utility!
