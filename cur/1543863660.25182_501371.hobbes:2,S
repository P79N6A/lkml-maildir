Hi Chuck,
    hi Eric,
cause you both asked me nearly the same i will answer you both in one mail.
 > What is different about these servers?
All 300 machines are mostly different. We have Dual Opteron, single P4 
with HT, single P4 without HT, Dual Xeon, Athlon 64 X2, and many more... 
different mainboards etc.
The only thing i found out is, that all these servers (where the problem 
exist) are using a DFI PM-12 Mainboard with a VIA Chipset.

No every machine builds it's own kernel.
