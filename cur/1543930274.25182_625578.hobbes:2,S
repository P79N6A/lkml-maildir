The site says it is based on ALi M5283 and this[1] SATA support status page
(Revised Feb 27 2007) says it is supported and the driver is production quality.
sata_uli is the driver.
This [2] review over at Newegg says it works with Linux.
More over the changelogs for sata_uli.c do not indicate they removed support for
it and Google says people found and fixed bugs with that drive [3] - so it would
be a safe bet to say it should be supported with current kernels.

[ I went through this recently when I had to buy a SATA card - I got one with a
Silicon Image chip for no particular reason ]
