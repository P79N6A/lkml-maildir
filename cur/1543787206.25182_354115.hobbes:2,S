This means that they have an IOP on the same
silicone or on the same packaging.
This means, again that they'd done all transport
specific tasks in the FW (by the IOP).
Again, such solutions do _not_ need the
SAS Transport Layer.
They don't even need the attributes, but
as a "nice to have" feature, you can use
transport attributes.
You, as technical person, should recognize
the different needs and thus the different
solutions between LSI's implementation and
Adaptec's.
I'm surprised you never chimed in in defense
of the _different_ technology.
See, I've mentioned many times that the two
radically different technologies can coexist.
But I've not heard any technical word
from the other guys: you.
