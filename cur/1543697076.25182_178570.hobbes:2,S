hmm, file2alias uses lower letters as the identifier (seprator?), so i
think simply using lower hex letter will be confusing.  wouldn't it be
better to have an  explicit delimter character like ':' (or '/' or
whatever) ?

at first i'll try to add the support of old isapnp format for
compatibility, so that old programs can work as they are.
the file2alias format of (isa) pnp devices will need variable number
of items, since a driver may require multiple ids.
for example, snd-cs4236 driver supports the cards with three ids like
	CSCe825:CSC0100:CSC0110
and four ids like
	CSCd937:CSC0000:CSC0010:CSC0003
in each case, a matching card must include all ids listed there.
well, i'm not sure which identifier (separator) letter in which style
should be used.  something like
	pnp:idXXXxxxxd0XXXxxxxd1XXXXxxxx
??  separators including a number might be a bad idea, though...
