It's mostly GPL'ed, but there are binary-only objects both in the
user-mode daemon (modem/dsplibs.o) and in the kernel driver
(drivers/amrlibs.o). 
The good news is that there a completely GPL'ed, source-complete
driver already in the 2.6 kernel, sound/pci/intel8x0m.c, which will
work with the user-mode daemon found in the smlink.com distribution.
This driver doesn't have all of the functionality of slamr driver
(which requires the propietary, binary-only object file) --- most
notably, ATM1 doesn't work when using the completely open-source
intl8x0m driver.  However, it does work just fine, and so as long as
you don't mind using the propietary object file in user-space, it's a
great solution.  I've been using the smlink daemon with both the
open-source and partial-propietary driver, and both work just fine on
my T40 laptop.
