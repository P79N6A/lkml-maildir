I don't either  :)

Yes, but I do think fixing the naming will help that.

Was the put_and_finalize_nsproxy() not sufficient?

Confounded, you're right, the exit_task_namespaces() in B
would see that B had reduced the nsproxy->count to 0, and
free the nsproxy, so that exit_notify() in A would oops.
And that should be triggerable right now.
I'm afraid adding an extra refcount for the mounts is
unavoidable.

That *would* lead to much more readable code.
