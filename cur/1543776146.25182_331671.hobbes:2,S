Still looking into this issue on -51-06.  Found something really odd:  
SCHED_NORMAL tasks will start to inherit the priority value of some other
SCHED_FIFO task.  If JACK is started at a given SCHED_FIFO priority, X and
all of its children will inherit the same priority value after login.  
Other random processes will inherit this, too -- sometimes init...
SCHED_NORMAL tasks suddenly inheriting priority values in the range
normally reserved for SCHED_FIFO could explain at least part of the
meltdown I've been seeing.  Any thoughts?
Cheers,
