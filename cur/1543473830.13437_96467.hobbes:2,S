And counting down.... fast. A lot of /proc is fairly easy to kill and doesnt
increase code size - some of it though adds several K a driver and I've
left them - it still boots too 8)

One thing Donald and others have talked about repeatedly is making driver
initialization for stuff like PCI be done by tables in sections and some
smart set up code. So the boot code doesnt call init this and init that it 
does
	init_pci_class(CLASS_NETWORK);
etc, and looks over a table built at boot time.
