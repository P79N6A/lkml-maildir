No.  The ioapic is completely disabled in this case.

No.  All of the ioapic routing entries are disabled.

Grr. Yes. The i8259.  Got the timer and the PIC numbers confused Oops.
The legacy configuration is the timer to the PIC to either the local
or the ioapic.

Yep.  You have it straight.

Grr.  That should have been ioapic_i8259.  The second value we print out
in the ..Timer printk.

Well if you didn't have the local apic enabled beyond virtual wire
mode that could have cause problems.
Sure.  I suspect the probably is that you were still in a legacy irq
mode.

Just try and make certain: ioapic_i8259.pin != -1
Which should cause disable_IO_APIC to put the ioapic and not the local
apic in virtual wire mode.
Anything else is likely to do strange things.
