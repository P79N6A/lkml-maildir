You don't want base 2.6.9 anyway because it has lots of bad bugs in it
and security holes. It also won't compile with a modern gcc.
One fix is to unpack the Fedora Core 3 update kernel which is 2.6.9 +
some
bits of -ac + other fixes, and then apply it to that. The changes are
fairly
small so it probably will work especially if you drop the 4G/4G patch
out.
Otherwise you can get collections of 2.6.9 fix patches from the 2.6.9-ac
tree
and two or three others.
