How do you know for sure it's the same problem?
An example from doing regression tracking for an earlier kernel:
There were four similar sounding regression reports.
Three for one regression.
And the fourth turned out to be a completely different regression.
Most likely it will turn out these two reports are for the same 
regression, but until that's verified it mustn't be assumed that
they are for sure for the same regression.
