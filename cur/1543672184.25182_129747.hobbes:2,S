I had high hopes for these patches but unfortunately they didn't
fix the problem I've had with the built-in Broadcom chip on the
ASUS A7V8X motherboard:  after bootup I still need to do an
'ifconfig eth0 down' followed by 'ifconfig eth0 up' before the
chip will actually start passing packets.  From then 'til the
next reboot the chip works fine.
