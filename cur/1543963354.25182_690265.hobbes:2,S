ok sounds like I like the fairness part of the new semaphores (but
obviously not the 67% performance downside; I'd expect to sacrifice a
little performance.. but this much??).
It sucks though; if this were a mutex, we could wake up the owner of
the bugger in the contented acquire path synchronously.... but these 
are semaphores, and don't have an owner ;( bah bah bah
