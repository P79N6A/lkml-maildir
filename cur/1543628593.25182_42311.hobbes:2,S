Maybe it could just WARN and still bring it up, if it's just
an MTU issue?  (Or is this a total failure of VLAN support you
are talking about?)
Also, is there any good reason that we can't get at least a compile
time change into some of the drivers like tulip where we know we can
get at least MOST of the cards supported with a small change?
I know the driver writers hate cruft in the drivers, but we have had
ppl using the patches in production machines for months, if not years,
with no ill effects.
The same argument applies to the EEPRO driver (we know a cure, but it's
a magic register number, and no one will accept the patch).
