IMHO the other way around, first of all I'm not using the infinite loop,
and I dropped a few bits ready for doing a few different things in the
next days like selecting the process to kill in function of the
allocation rate and by collecting away exclusive pages in get_swap_page
etc...
I'll release the stuff soon as usual in separate patches easily readable
and mergeable, because as said I cannot find anything wrong anymore in
the allocator with my testing resources. Of course I'd really like if
you could test it on the 16G box, but as said it won't test the approch
to the allocator faliure fixes that is been implemented in mainline
which I understood you're working on at the moment.
