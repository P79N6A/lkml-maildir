Ah, I see what you're getting at. OK, then, in the case of voluntary sleeps,
we set the last_cpu regardless of cycles used. I'm not sure if we can do
this automatically: I don't think we can distinguish voluntary from
involuntary in schedule(), and I don't know what functions are called when a
process sleeps. If not automatically, then maybe we can let kernelspace code
set the last_cpu manually, when it sleeps and wants the rescheduling
advantage.

Well, then, I'll look into actually coding the patch.
