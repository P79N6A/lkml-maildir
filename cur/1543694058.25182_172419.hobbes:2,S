I've seen a disk (which now failed and will be replaced 3 hours from now)
remap defective sectors without reporting any errors to the OS. 
The SMART "remapped sector count" just went up, but no errors in the
logs. So apparently, the disk noticed something and remapped teh sector
without anybody noticing.

Try: 
	tar cf - / | dd of=/dev/null
(note some people will try to abbreviate that to 
	tar cf /dev/null / 
but that won't work: Tar will recognise that it's writing to /dev/null
and skip reading the files! That's a bug in tar in my book. )

man tune2fs .
You have to do the math on the LBA sector numbers (subtract the
partition start, divide by two). 
Also, you can use the "badblocks" program.
