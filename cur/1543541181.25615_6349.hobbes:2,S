While coverage can be useful in some cases, I don't think it is going to
be a good benchmark for the Linux kernel.  We are going to concentrate
more on functional coverage over code coverage.  If we do some code
coverage work, user-mode Linux would definately be the way to go.
While building user-mode Linux, what do you use for testing?  Do you
build special test cases for the portions that you recently worked on?
If you have any tests, would you care to share them?
