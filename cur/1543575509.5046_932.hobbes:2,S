Heh...do what I did.  Go on eBay and pick up a Hayes ESP card.
I have a fairly weak system by todays standards, and I found that
even with a 16550 serial port, I'd get tcp/ip errors in my logs
(and lots of 'em).
They never wrote decent ESP drivers for Windows, but the
Linux drivers are superb.   I popped it in, configured it,
and the tcp errors vanished...not a single one in the 10 months
I've owned it.
It bugs me that they're making PC's w/o ISA cards now, because
I dont wanna give up my Hayes ESP.   Based on what I saw, a 16550
with it's tiny 16-byte buffer, isnt enough.
(yes, I'm stuck with POTS+PPP.  Cable modems are available...
but the ISP is @Hoax.  Yuck.   The only DSL grade I can get is
IDSL -- $70/month.  Double yuck.)
