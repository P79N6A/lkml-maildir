Hi
	I can't seem to find this mentioned anywhere. My 2.4 machine
sets 2 bits in the TCP header between the 4 data offset bits and control 
flags. Like so:
11/29-20:25:42.695096 24.67.152.12:62373 -> 192.18.97.241:80
TCP TTL:63 TOS:0x0 ID:0  DF
21S***** Seq: 0x74E55D1A   Ack: 0x0   Win: 0x16D0
TCP Options => MSS: 1460 SackOK TS: 1767921 0 NOP WS: 0
or hex a0c2 / binary 10100000 11000010
			      ^^
This packet is never ACK'd by www.sun.com and the only difference I
can see from one that is are these two bits. RFC793 says they must be zero.
Is 793 still current? Has anyone else seen this?
