This sounds very like my resp2 (www.unyuug.org/benchmarks/) program I
announced on this list some months ago, but resp2 generates loads of a
specific type so that you can determine of changes affect i/o load,
swapping load, CPU load, etc.

Note: the context switching benchmark is at the same URL. I have posted
some output recently, haven't had a of feedback other than some folks
mailing results to me without copying the list.
