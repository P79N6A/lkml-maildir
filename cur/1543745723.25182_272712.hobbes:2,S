Subject: make oldconfig all does not work

When doing
make oldconfig all
make oldconfig is executed, while make all is not. Simply using
make oldconfig and make all separately works.
There is also mention of attention given to this problem in the Makefile:
# To make sure we do not include .config for any of the *config targets
# catch them early, and hand them over to scripts/kconfig/Makefile
# It is allowed to specify more targets when calling make, including
# mixing *config targets and build targets.
# For example 'make oldconfig all'.
But, probably, when adding KBUILD_EXTMOD and _all targets, this broke.
