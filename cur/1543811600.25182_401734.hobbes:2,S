To be clear I was talking name suffixes.  So ipc_space certainly conveys
something, and even ipc_ns may be ok.

Just wanted to make certain we agreed on the scope.

Well all of the other things we can share or not share are already
outside of the tasklist_lock.
We may not be quite minimal but we actually are fairly close to minimal
inside the tasklist_lock.

Yes.  I think the easy way to handle this is to have a symlink
from /proc/sysvipc to /proc/self/sysvipc.  And then we have a per
process reporting area.
That preserves all of the old programs but enables us to get the
information out.

Yep.
