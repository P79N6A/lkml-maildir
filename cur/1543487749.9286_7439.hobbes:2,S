hi
	I use a linux box (debian2.0 - kernel 2.0.36 with filehandle v8.04
patch, PII 450+512M+9GBHD,4 epro100 netcard ) as a IP masq gateway.
It supports about 300 PCs now (100M switch ethernet).
	But recently,I found there were many error
message: ip_masq_new(proto=??): no free ports ,when the
network is in the heavy load.
	I have tried to modified the IP_MASQ_TAB_SIZE to 8192,and changed
the PORT_MASQ_BEGIN & PORT_MASQ_END. It can use ports from 41000 to
57384.But the error messages still display.
	How can I do ? Thanks.
