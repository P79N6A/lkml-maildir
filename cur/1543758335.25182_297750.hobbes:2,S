BTW: turning white does not necessarily mean "screen is dying" but can
also mean "LCD is powered off and slowly turning transparent but the
backlight is still on" which brings me back to the original subject:
Sharp PC-AR10 (ATI rage mobility P/M AGP 2x), which is sort of the
crappiest hardware i have ever seen, has working S3 without any tricks.
The backlight is not turned off at S3 but in fact it is explicitly
turned on (if i do "xset dpms force off" before suspend, it turns back
on after  or shortly before entering suspend) and the screen slowly goes
white (because TFT power is turned off), but if you enter S3 via
lidswitch this does not matter since the lidswitch turns off the
backlight :-)
