Not really.  Memory reclaim tries to predict the future and expects some

hopelessly wrong.  Although we could surely provide manual hinting
machinery which is less crude than this proposal.

Yes, that would be preferable - I don't know what the difficulty is with
that.  sys_set_mempolicy() should provide a sufficiently good hint.
