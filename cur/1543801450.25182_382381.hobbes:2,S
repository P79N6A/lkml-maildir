	Right. I forgot to repeat what I mentioned in the parent email -- that
this patch is intended to be applied on top of Shailabh's patches.
	The first patch I posted (01/01) is intended for plain 2.6.15. Before
proposing 01/01 for -mm I've been trying to see if there are any
problems with the value of tsk->exit_signal before exit_mm() -- hence
the "[RFC]" in the subject line of that one.
Thanks,
