Any special reason to make it separate instead of patching init.c?
Most of codes (e.g. dummy callbacks) are already in init.c.

We can use a standard list here.

IIRC, the reason that snd_card_disconnect() uses GFP_ATOMIC is that
(usb-)disconnection was atomic in the earlier time.
You're using mutex here, hence no reason to allocate with GFP_ATOMIC.

You can add to the item to head :)  The order doesn't matter.

I wonder whether the old release might be called during this
operation.  Then df won't be freed.

A standard list would make the code more readable (unless you use too
many underscores ;)
Thanks,
