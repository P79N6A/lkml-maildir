Hi Wichert,
Looking at your trace it seems that the receiving machine is dropping
all packets that do not have traffic class set. Note that all segments
received with [class 0x2] get properly acked. The others probably don't
get to TCP at all. You might want to check your filters and QoS
policies.
BR,
