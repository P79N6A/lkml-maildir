The battery buffered cache is about 100Mb compared to 8k or 16k of the
disk buffer cache itself. So it won't become full that fast...
I just tested the same with my other controller (a 3ware 9550SX) which
has an option to configure explicitly if a write is acknowledged as
soon as the data is saved to the (buffered) memory or if it will delay
the acknowledge until data got written to disk. So this is similar to
enabling/disabling the disk cache on a plain disk. I did not found a
way to configure this on my older 3ware 9500S controller, even if it
has a battery backup, too (will ask 3ware about this).

I read something about "write barriers", but I don't know if these are
already used by my current 2.6.15 (I may try to use the actual kernel
tomorrow). Is there a difference between a SATA disk and a SCSI disk?
(which is emulated by my 3Ware controllers).
Dieter.
