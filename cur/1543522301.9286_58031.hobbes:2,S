	Well, at 6000 processes every 20 seconds (approx 300/second) and a
PID space of 4294967295 (32bit unsigned int), you will roll over/run out in 
around 165 days.  Of course, if you wanted to use a PID space of
18446744073709551616 (64bit unsigned int), you will roll over/run out in
around 1,949,808,057 years...
	Of course, who wants to type in a 20 digit number? :)  I suppose if
you feel the need for security that badly you could patch the kernel to use
a 64bit PID space, and just panic when you run out, based on the assumption
that something _very_ bad is happening if you run out. :)
