It isn't, since it can not set rlimit, and if it can, it still can drop
it.
Your code does not cover sendpage() interface (aka splice() and
sendfile()) and with your approach application will suddenly stops
sending data even into old sockets, but will be able to receive it from
anywhere. Is it intentional?
The same goal can be achieved with 'owner' iptables match module btw.
