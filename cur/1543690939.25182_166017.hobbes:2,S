I sort of do - several vendor installers use fixed labels so
two installs on the same box get very confused. I've seen
novices tie themselves in knots with it before. That isn't
a problem with LABEL=, its an implementation issue with the
vendors install tools, and Red Hat certainly is one of the
parties that made this mistake.
