The introduction of pathput is fine we me.  The removal of path_release
doesn't make much sense.  We have tons of invocations of exactly that
patter, and having keeping path_release for that makes a lot of sense.
I also think there rename from dput_path to pathput_conditional is
rather pointless.  Sure, that thing needs a better name, but
pathput_conditional is not a better name.
And all of the functions could use some kerneldoc comments describing them.
