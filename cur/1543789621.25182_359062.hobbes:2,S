it's generally on a pci bus order. However... if you switch to acpi by
going from 2.4 to 2.6, the pci bus order might change.
The good news is that you can do a few things to mitigate this:
1) Several distros (including Fedora Core) allow you to bind ethX
numbers to mac addresses, eg effectively persistent binding of ethX
numbers to specific cards
2) you can rename ethX to ethY yourself with nameif and similar tools.
