Ingo Oeser  <ioe-lkml@rameria.de> asked:
| Sorry, but I still don't get, what a "const volatile" is supposed to mean.

The ones which I always have to look at multiple times are the "const
pointer to volatile" and "volatile pointer to const." As in unchanging
pointer to a volatile datum, or a volatile pointer to unchanging data.
