to all concerned 
iam a noob and i had some peculiar problem 
during debugging of an assembly coded binary 
for referance you can visit and glance through this
thread in fasm board
http://board.flatassembler.net/forum.php?f=4
and googling around and ircing a bit led me to this
post in your mailing list
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0406.3/1126.html
i actually wanted to reply to that thread so that the
questions is continous 
but i cant find out how i can reply to that thread 
i see linux torvalds himself has replied to that
thread though i dont understand much of those 
i sense it is a performance (speed issue)
but i see the behaviour in gdb due to this 
is kinda nasty (sigsegvs the binary and executes an
instruction from the middle :(
hope some one could provide some insightas to how 
i could still force a break on the test eax,eax 
and also survive without being sigsegved ??
i give the kernel version of mine atm 
uname -r
2.4.21-260-smp4G
thanks and regards
nixnoob
