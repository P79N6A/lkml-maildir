Only the read-only version is monetarily free.

Do you mean NTFSDOS from SysInternals? If so, look at it again and you'll
see that it uses the NTFS.sys and NTOSKRNL.exe files from an NT
installation. They worked around the need to understand the filesystem by
just writing a wrapper for the NTFS driver that MS released. And if you
care to trust that sort of wrapper take a look at CaptiveNTFS and you'll
see the exact same thing for Linux, except you don't have to pay for write
support with CaptiveNTFS. You just have to pray that it works right.
Jim.
