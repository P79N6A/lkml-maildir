	Actually, the patch is wrong.
	The device_register has to be done in scsi_add_host,
	The correct fix is to move the corresponding device_unregister
	into scsi_remove_host so that they match.
Very good. That was what I had done first, but a google search
turned up your patch and I thought that it was also OK.
	I'll also commit it to the scsi-misc-2.5 BK tree.
Hope to see it in 2.5.51.
