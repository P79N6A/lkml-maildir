Actually, it makes sense when you think about it.  The `fd' is actually
a capability that the application uses to refer to the open file in the
kernel.  If the app does a close() on the fd, it destroys this naming.
The application then has no capability left which refers to the formerly
open socket, and conversly, the kernel has no capability (name) to notify
the application of a close event.  What can I say, "the fd formerly known
as X" is now gone?  It would be incorrect to say that "fd X was closed",
since X no longer refers to anything, and the application may have reused
that fd for another file.
As for the multi-thread case, this would be a bug; if one thread closes
the descriptor, the other thread is going to get an EBADF when it goes 
to perform the read.
