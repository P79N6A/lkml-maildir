Hi,
 after going from 2.6.6-mm5 to 2.6.7-mm1, I see the following problems.
a) System hangs at boot. Local APIC related. This is a known problem on
the OB, but could be avoided by specifying "nolapic" in 2.6.6-mm5. With
2.6.7-mm1 I have to specify "acpi=off", or apply the following patch
from Len:

  Interestingly, "nolapic" still makes a difference when Lens patch is
not installed. Without it, the boot process hangs at the same place as
in 2.6.6/2.6.6-mm5 - just after these lines in dmesg:
>>>
ACPI: Subsystem revision 20040326
ACPI: IRQ9 SCI: Edge set to Level Trigger.
    ACPI-0179: *** Warning: The ACPI AML in your computer contains
errors, please nag the manufacturer to correct it.
    ACPI-0182: *** Warning: Allowing relaxed access to fields; turn on
CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG for details.
<<<
 With "nolapic" it now hangs after the following output:
>>>
Checking if this processor honours the WP bit even in supervisor
mode... Ok.
Calibrating delay loop...
<<<
 It never displays the Bogomips.
b) The system does not shut down (or reboot) any more. The last output
is:
ISDN-subsystem unloaded
 Sometimes CTRL-ALT-DEL helps to bring the system down, sometimes I
just have to reset it.
 So, it seems that 2.6.7-mm1 is not the most lucky of all releases. I
have not tested 2.6.7 vanilla. I would "prefer" not to, as the Onmibook
is dog slow compiling kernels :-(
 "dmesg" (with lens patch) and ".config" attached.
Cheers
Martin
