In ACPI's case, kernel has to do 3 steps to get node id from physicall 
address.
  1) parse DSDT to get device handle of ACPI for new memory.
     This step can be described 3 detail steps.
      1-1) search memory device in DSDT.
      1-2) get _CRS of its memory device to see physicall address.
      1-3) compare 1-2)'s address with required paddr.
           (its memory device might be for other memory.)
           If it is for new memory, then goto step 2),
           else goto 1-1) again.
  2) get pxm against its device handle.
     It is just calling acpi_get_pxm().
  3) get node from pxm. If pxm is new one, new node id is assigned.
Step 1) is a bit complicated.
But, when notify of memory hot-add event reaches via ACPI,
its handle is already obtained. So, step 2) and 3) are enough to
get node id. If node id can be passed at add_memory(), that is all.
If not, kernel losts memory device handle information or node id once
at calling add_memory(), and search memory device handle again by step 1).
In addition, if paddr to node id translation is called in add_memory(),
then its code for -each arch- will be like followings.
This will be close from ugly "copy and paste" again....... :-(
 
add_memory(paddr)
{
	nid = paddr_to_node_id(paddr)
	if (!node_online(nid)) {
		pgdat = hotadd_new_pgdat(nid, start);
		if (!pgdat)
			return -ENOMEM;
	}
              :
Bye.
