You're 100% right. Internally, the patch I sent is composed of 30
different patches. The reason I didn't seperate it into two patches is
that the changes were interleaved and inter-dependant and seperating
them was a b*tch. If Andrew wishes to include it in -mm or you wish to
include it in -vanilla and would like it in two seperate patches, I'll
go back and redo it that way. 
Thanks and cheers,
