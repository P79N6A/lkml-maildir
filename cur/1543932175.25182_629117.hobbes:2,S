first of all, the 2 with which I was seeing that have had their memtest run 
for some hours some weeks ago, without problems. I can compile stuff - like 
the latest kde4 rc without segfaults or problems (except when the oops is 
happening), and this mess only started recently. To be more correct:
the swap-mess only started with 2.6.23.11. With 2.6.23.9 I get the kio_http... 
rip's, but no swap related messages.
Overheating is very unlikely. I made sure that my computer is very well 
cooled. Even under high load I get something like 50°C from lmsensors and 
bios - and the errors are completly unrelated to load. Or temperature. 
Without load my cpu idles at ~30°C. Again, lmsensors and bios are very close 
about that.
Glück Auf,
Volker
