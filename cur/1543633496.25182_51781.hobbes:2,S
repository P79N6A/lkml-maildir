Subject: [PATCH] friendly kernel 2.4.18 endianness logical mistakes patch correction on fbcon-cfb2.c and fbcon-cfb4.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

DESCRIPTIONS:
SECOND VERSION 2 small patchs to apply to::
drivers\video\fbcon-cfb2.c
drivers\video\fbcon-cf4.c o
This patchs correct the endianness logical of nibbletab, the first table is
u_char mades so no endian needed and the second swap correctly bytes in
LITTLE_ENDIAN. (old version swap half bytes instead of bytes).
Second version, is much more FRIENDLY and don't break current tree but let
the ability to create new option in driver/video/Config.in, option
CONFIG_FBCON_NOSWAP witch reverse and correct tables orders for fbcon-cfb4.c
and fbcon-cfb2.c.
Patchs don't add currently the CONFIG_FBCON_NOSWAP option definition in
Config.in since I use it in other tree so this can be quickly integrated to
linux kernel and defined in other linux kernel tree without too much
unuseful changes. Option will be added in main linux kernel
driver/video/Config.in only if necessary (It supposed not).
