 Just my 0.02 :
 does it work with other kernel version?
 If not, you may try another bootloader, let's say Gujin:
 It manages the keyboard chip differently - it opens A20 and reset
 the keyboard interface itself if needed.
 May work, may not work, YMMV...
 Note also your startup lines:
|agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 199M
|agpgart: Unsupported SiS chipset (device id: 0651), you might want to try
|agp_try_unsupported=1.
|agpgart: no supported devices found.

P.S. Nice place it is, Limoges.
