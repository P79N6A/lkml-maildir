Hi all,
I've got some troubles when mounting a NFS filesystem at boot time, with
kernel 2.2.1.
My linux box mounts two file systems at boot time, from two Solaris 2.5/2.6
fileservers. Several RPC error messages are reported; this is an excerpt of
console messages:
.....
eth0: 3c509 at 0x300 tag 1, 10baseT port, address  00 10 4b 24 d4 08, IRQ 10.
3c509.c:1.12 6/4/97 becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov
eth0: Setting Rx mode to 1 addresses.
portmap: RPC call returned error 111
RPC: task of released request still queued!
RPC: (task is on xprt_pending)
portmap: RPC call returned error 111
RPC: task of released request still queued!
RPC: (task is on xprt_pending)
lockd_up: makesock failed, error=-111
portmap: RPC call returned error 111
RPC: task of released request still queued!
RPC: (task is on xprt_pending)
lockd_up: no pid, 2 users??
portmap: RPC call returned error 111
RPC: task of released request still queued!
RPC: (task is on xprt_pending)
portmap: RPC call returned error 111
RPC: task of released request still queued!
RPC: (task is on xprt_pending)
portmap: RPC call returned error 111
RPC: task of released request still queued!
RPC: (task is on xprt_pending)
lockd_up: no pid, 3 users??
.....
Then, actually, it works quite fine - the file systems are eventually mounted,
without any further problem (apparently).  Any hint/explanation?
Thanx,
- Marino
