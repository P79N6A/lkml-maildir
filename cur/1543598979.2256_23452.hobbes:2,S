Well, sometimes this increases productivity. ;-)

Well, if everyone has to monitor every other developer, there would be
problems, too.

Of course, Aegis supports multiple changes which are being developed
at the same time.

IIRC, some time in the past, Linus said that he was the integrator and
the subsystem maintainers the reviewers.  I think the Linux
development process is actually pretty close to the Aegis model.
(However, the Aegis implementation seems to have some properties which
make it a bit unsuitable for controlling the Linux kernel
development.)
