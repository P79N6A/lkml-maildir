Adrian,
I know of the other GPL exports but no one complained about problems with them. :)
Yes, you are right, to be orthogonal and clean it would be necessary to do 
require modutils-2.4.10 and have EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL.
I just dont want to break existing user setups - due to the security problems
many might upgrade.
I'm just trying to be user-friendly.
