Here is a question for you. Presently both the serial ttys and VT ttys 
share the same major number. Minor number 1 to 63 is allocated to the VTs 
and 64 and above to serial ttys. One of the great limitations for my home 
system is that I can have only 63 VTs. Can udev work around this 
limitation?
