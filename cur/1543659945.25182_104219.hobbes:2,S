There's a driver at 
http://www.physcip.uni-stuttgart.de/heby/ltmodem/
It's worked quite well for me.. (with T21) The only real trouble with it 
is that it's largely binary only :(
Another caveat with T2x'es is that there are two kinds of them: for the 
seemingly more common variant the ltmodem driver works, for the other 
MiniPCI modem no driver exists.
