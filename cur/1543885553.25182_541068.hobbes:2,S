Tough, the kernel community has voted against you.
It makes far more sense to include a driver during kernel configuration, 
and have that driver pull in its libraries via 'select'.  The lame 
alternative requires developers to know which libraries they need BEFORE 
picking their drivers, which is backwards and requires legwork on the 
part of the kernel developer.
