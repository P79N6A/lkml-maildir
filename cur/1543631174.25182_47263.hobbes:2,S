What you are proposing seem a bit vague.  I think that
CLONE_THREAD should group all the thread related stuff under
the one flag.  IMHO POSIX compatibility should not be off in
the corner as a step child, but rather should be the norm. 
The CLONE_THREAD flag would indicate to fork that it should
create a POSIX thread and set up the needed shared stuff.  I
rather image this to be a structure that each task_struct
points to, possibly with a usage count (but that is a
detail).  Each thread_struct would point to such a
structure, but processes that are not threaded would not be
sharing this area with other threads.
Is this close to what you had in mind?
