what do you mean? We call reschedule_idle() only when a process 1) gets
runnable 2) gets scheduled away (but is still runnable). These are two
different situations.

this recalculation argument is a complete red herring. I've explained this
earlier too: the number of recalculations happens at a _constant
frequency_, with the additional mechanizm that there are less
recalculations if there are more CPU-bound processes. The goal is to have
tasks' increase their 'dynamic priority' even if they are not on the
runqueue. So any architectural change that concentrates on removing these
recalculations is seriously misguided.
