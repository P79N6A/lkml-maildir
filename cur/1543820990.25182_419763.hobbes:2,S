I'm not always calling it now, only when necessary.  In any case, I'd
much rather pay 4us (it averages 1) every 100ms when at 100% cpu than
take a multi-second latency hit for high priority tasks as now occurs
with a heavy load when the array switch is forced.  This hit is more
likely with my (unfortunately necessary) change to wake tasks on the
expired array.  That's why I started trying to eliminate the switch.
