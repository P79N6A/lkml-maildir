I'm probably responsible for your patch never beeing merged then, sorry
about that. MESH is a weird beast, sometimes, fixing it for one case will
break others, it's pretty timing sensitive and full of interesting HW
bugs. One problem I have currently is the lack of HW. Fortunately, I've
managed to get back an old 8500 class machine (with MESH), this will
allow me to play a bit with it.
I'm away for now, but I'll look into this once I'm back, next week.
Ben.
