	My methods are nowhere near as scientific as playing an mp3
to determine kernel responsiveness (sarcasm), but I have not experienced
any trouble thusfar with 2.2.3.  Architecture is Alpha, so perhaps this
is specific to x86, no? Have you examined other processes which are 
active while conducting your tests or compiling?

Daniel
