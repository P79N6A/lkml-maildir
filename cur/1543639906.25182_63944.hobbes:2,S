Yes, this is obviously a good idea, and also it's what CML2 did.
Especially considering that (NEW) is automatically generated, and
(NEW) is not intuitively different from (EXPERIMENTAL) to the lay

The trouble is actually achieving that in shell-based parsers where
shell code cannot tell whether $CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL has been used in
a condition.
