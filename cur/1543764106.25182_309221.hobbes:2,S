Hi!
This fixes u32 vs. pm_message_t confusion in documentation, and
removes references to no-longer-existing (*save_state), too. With
exception of USB (I hope David will fix/apply my patch), this should
fix last piece of this confusion... famous last words.
Please apply,
                                                                Pavel

 These functions are intended for use by individual drivers, and are defined in 
 struct pci_driver:
 
-        int  (*save_state) (struct pci_dev *dev, u32 state);
-        int  (*suspend) (struct pci_dev *dev, u32 state);
+        int  (*suspend) (struct pci_dev *dev, pm_message_t state);

-save_state
-----------
-
-Usage:
-
-if (dev->driver && dev->driver->save_state)
-	dev->driver->save_state(dev,state);
-
-The driver should use this callback to save device state. It should take into
-account the current state of the device and the requested state in order to
-avoid any unnecessary operations.
-
-For example, a video card that supports all 4 states (D0-D3), all controller
-context is preserved when entering D1, but the screen is placed into a low power
-state (blanked). 
-
-The driver can also interpret this function as a notification that it may be
-entering a sleep state in the near future. If it knows that the device cannot
-enter the requested state, either because of lack of support for it, or because
-the device is middle of some critical operation, then it should fail.
-
-This function should not be used to set any state in the device or the driver
-because the device may not actually enter the sleep state (e.g. another driver
-later causes causes a global state transition to fail).
-
-Note that in intermediate low power states, a device's I/O and memory spaces may
-be disabled and may not be available in subsequent transitions to lower power
-states.
