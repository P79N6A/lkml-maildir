I have a box (dual opteron) that "reliably" has XFS failing every night
with kernels >= 2.6.16.  It stays up without any problems with 2.6.15.7.
I've started doing a git bisect, and it failed with some 2.6.16-rc2
version, albeit in a different way to the usual XFS failure: all disk IO
related tasks were locked up in state 'D', no kernel messages on the
console. Probably not related to the previous XFS problem, I guess.
I now need to run at least one night with the "known good" 2.6.15.7,
but I'll report any further findings.
