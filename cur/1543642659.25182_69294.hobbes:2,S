So, you break everyone's compile later *and* you have to figure out
which initializers were required, and which ones were bogus.
*Planning* to break an interface is just stupid.

Yeah, but you can still leave a spinlock uninitialized, and it'll
work.
I'm not making an interface harder to use because of one of 17
architectures refuses to fix a bug in their toolchain.  Just not
happening, sorry.
I want *you* to feel the pain, not spread it around by leaving turds
throughout the code long after the bug is forgotten:
