Well, directed graphs can have cycles. But the revision graph of a
revision control system has to be an acyclic directed graph. Otherwise
parenthood would be a complicated matter ;)
And no, trees by definition don't have cycles. Also, a "tree" in git
lingo is not the graph theoretic notion (which David uses, though
incorrectly); this only adds unnecessary points of confusion.
For whatever reason the graphs in version control systems are called
"dag"s, i.e. directed acyclic graphs, even though "acyclicity" depends
on whether you look at the directed or undirected graphs. (Branching
then merging gives an undirected cycle.) I guess one may read "directed"
as an attribute to "acyclic" here, i.e. ((directed acyclic) graph)
rather than (directed (acyclic graph)); so to say "directedly acyclic
graph". Or it's just that "dag" reads much better than "adg"...
So, please: Simplification yes, but not if it's unnecessarily misleading
or even plain wrong (referring to the original proposal, not the comment).
Cheers,
