Gee...I did one too, including a simple sample module which shows how it
all works; see 
http://lwn.net/Articles/22355/.
  It's part of the larger
"driver porting" series at 
http://lwn.net/Articles/driver-porting/;
 there's
a dozen articles there now, most of which have passed out of the
subscription period and are freely available.
