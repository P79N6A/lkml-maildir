2.6.18-rc1-git5-64-smp cpufreq ondemand governor problem on SMP DUALCORE AMD 
64bit system
 - start 2 processes with infinite loop in each - OK both cores 100% 
utilization cpu speed max
 - kill one - BAD now one core utilization ~100% but cpu speed dropped to 
core with lowest utilization - fluctuating from min at this level depending 
on system activity.
any possibility to setup ondemand governor for max speed if only 1 core 
utilization is maxed - full speed for single-process/single-thread activity 
?
looks like cpufreq ondemand governor sets two frequency dependent cores to 
speed level ok for that one with lowest utilization slowing down 
process/thread working on other core. For now it is ok for independent 
multiprocessor bad for multicore-freq-dependent.

(observe cpu-freq and utilization
terminal-1: awk 'BEGIN {for(i=0;i<100000;i++)for(j=0;j<10000;j++);}'
terminal-2: awk 'BEGIN {for(i=0;i<100000;i++)for(j=0;j<10000;j++);}'
kill one awk)
