Well, yes. There are lots of things Linux isn't suited for.
There are likewise a lot of patches that SGI would love to
get into the kernel so it runs better on their 500+ CPU
systems. My point was just that a new functionality/feature
doesn't by itself justify being included in the kernel.org
kernel.

Maybe there are damn few because it is hard to get right within
the framework of a general posix environment. Or maybe its
because it has a comparatively small userbase (compared to say
mid/small servers and desktops). Which are neither completely
invalid reasons against its inclusion in Linux.
But I want to be clear that I haven't read or thought about the
code in question too much, and I don't have any opinions on it
yet. So please nobody involve me in a flamewar about it :)
