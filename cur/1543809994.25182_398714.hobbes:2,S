Yeah it's stable, new entries have been added at the end if necessary. I
don't necessarily think it's a super way to find these things out,
sometimes older SCSI drives fail some of the mode sense / capability
probing and don't show correct values. So one could do better in user
space.
But at least it's a generic way to see which devices have been
registered as CDROM's, if that is the goal.
