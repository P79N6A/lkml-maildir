s/most programmers/some programmers/
While I can only speak for myself, I definitely had to make a decision
a couple of times without starting a kernel myself.  Red Hat wanted me
to sign a piece of small-font paper assigning my copyright to JFFS2
over to them.  My thoughts at the time were along the lines of "What
the fuck!!" and I had a lot of thinking to do, but didn't sign it.
My graph traversion code I did for my thesis should have been merged
into gcc, but I didn't even bother sending a patch.  Copyright assign
my ***, thank you very much.
And that is in fact the primary reason, hacking gcc has been fun and I
would like to do more, from a purely technical point of view.  But
having to sign a large amount of legalese is the kind of thing I may
have to do for a job, and they pay me for it.  It is not the kind of
thing I do for fun.  No fun, no money - hell, why should I do
something like that?!?
Thank you for not requiring copyright assignments, Linus.
Jörn
