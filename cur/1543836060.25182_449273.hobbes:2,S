Yes.  At the point of merging these two approaches I think the notes
should just be put into vmlinux and copied either into the ELF
header or more likely into a segment that build.c tacks onto
the kernel.
It is such a small piece of my overall picture I wasn't really looking
at that.

This note is used in etherboot and LinuxBIOS right now so it isn't terribly linux
specific.  And whatever the virtues of it's name it is actually in use.
I had a preliminary RFC for using these in a winder context at one point but I
ran out of energy for pushing it.
I think the information in those note headers is interesting beyond that I
really don't much care.
