Er, surely that's not a problem at all? This is desired behaviour?

Absolutely not.  If we mark a symbol EXPORT_SYMBOL, we want it exported. No 
questions asked.
The export entry _is_ relevant; furthermore it's the _only_ thing that's
relevant, and there is no way of knowing if there's a module that isn't in
the tree, or maybe even a module that _is_ in the tree but not compiled
today, that needs the symbol in question.
I sincerely hope it's just too early in the morning here and I'm 
misunderstanding you :)
