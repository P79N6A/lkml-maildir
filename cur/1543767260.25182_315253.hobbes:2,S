2.6.12-rc3-mm1 doesn't boot on my computer.
Comparing the point where booting stops with a boot from a working 
kernel, the first line that isn't displayed is the line where init says 
it's starting.
Ctrl-Alt-Del at this point reboots my computer.
Both 2.6.12-rc3 and 2.6.12-rc2-mm3 do boot.
My computer is a cheap desktop computer with one 1,8 GHz Athlon CPU.
I know what a binary search is, but since I currently need my computer 
and I can't do 10 compile and reboot cycles today any hints which 
patches are suspect of being guilty is appreciated.
