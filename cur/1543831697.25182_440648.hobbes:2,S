Yeah.  The tape ops figured I must have optimized something or gotten it
to do better incrementals - it would ask for the tape, and spit it out in
15 minutes instead of the 40-45 it used to take.  So it went un-noticed till
a full cycle of tapes had gone by...
Guess who was totally mystified when we lost a disk, we restored from tape,
and the system had time warped itself back 2 months? :)
