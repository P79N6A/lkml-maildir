Hmmmm. We've mapped a range that has been reserved for a delayed
allocate extent during a direct I/O. That should not happen as XFS
flushes delalloc extents before executing a direct read and holds
the I/O lock which will prevent any new writes from mapping new
delalloc extents. Something went astray, though. :(
Can you give me some more detail on the machine you're running?
e.g. How many CPUs, RAM and what type of disk subsystem you are using?
That will make it easier for us to try to reproduce this problem.
Cheers,
Dave.
