gcc uses "__attribute__" to specify compiler directives instead of the
traditional "#pragma" since #pragma behaviors are totally unportable and cannot
be placed into macros.  Consider this code:
    #include<stdlib.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    __attribute__ ((noreturn)) void message1(const char *msg)
    {
	printf(msg);
	exit(0);
    }
    int main( void)
    {
	message1("Hello\n");
    }
Without the __attribute__ ((noreturn)), the compiler would complain that
"control reaches end of non-void function" in main().  By using the attribute
we can give the compiler the hint that control will never go back to main(),
and it doesn't need to give a warning.
