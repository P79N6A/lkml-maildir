no, just use the same idea that is used to debug wait_queues

heh, thats my use for the waitqueue debug now 8)

oops, I mean the __waker thing, for debugging you could get the address of
the caller with current_text_addr() and store it in an extra sk_buff field
so that later on you could know who create the skb.
About the example of WAITQUEUE_DEBUG:
after being awaken you could do this:
                dprintk("sleeper=%p, waker=%lx\n",
                         current_text_addr(), wait.__waker);
in a inline function does the trick, but this is just an example of a
function that uses an extra debug field in a structure that is alocated
somewhere and you want to know who allocated it later on.
Yes, you'll have to decode the address from syslog, gotcha?
