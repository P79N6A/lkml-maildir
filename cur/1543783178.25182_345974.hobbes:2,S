Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The Solera Networks DS File System kernel patches have been posted at 
ftp.soleranetworks.com
and can be downloaded via anonymous ftp access.
These patches are for the 2.4.29, and 2.6.9 kernels.  These patches 
includes all kernel changes
made to the Linux kernel and GPL code that allows multiple gigabit 
capture and stream to disk capability
These patches are being provided as required by the terms of the GNU 
Public License.  Also included
with this announcement are white papers which can be located at 
www.soleranetworks.com describing the
appliance features and characteristics of the DSFS file system.
The Core File System code is a separate proprietary module and is not 
released under the GPL and is
shipped on the Solera Networks DS 1U, 2U, and 3U appliances.  DS 
Appliances support gigabit ethernet
and 10Ge Ethernet via the Intel e1000/ixgb adapter drivers.
Current Capture rates sustained with a 2U appliance with DSFS on Linux 
2.6.X and 2.4.X kernels are:
975,000 pps @ 72     byte packets x 2 interfaces  = 120 MB/S stream to disk
445,000 pps @ 256   byte packets x 2 interfaces  = 226 MB/S stream to disk
208,000 pps @ 576   byte packets x 2 interfaces  = 240 MB/S stream to disk
119,000 pps @ 1024 byte packets x 2 interfaces  = 245 MB/S stream to disk
82,000   pps @ 1500 byte packets x 2 interfaces  = 247 MB/S stream to disk
Current Capture rates sustained with a 1U appliance with DSFS on Linux 
2.6.X and 2.4.X kernels are:
975,000 pps @ 72     byte packets x 1 interfaces  = 60 MB/S stream to disk
445,000 pps @ 256   byte packets x 1 interfaces  = 113 MB/S stream to disk
208,000 pps @ 576   byte packets x 1 interfaces  = 119 MB/S stream to disk
119,000 pps @ 1024 byte packets x 1 interfaces  = 122 MB/S stream to disk
82,000   pps @ 1500 byte packets x 1 interfaces  = 123 MB/S stream to disk
Current Capture rates sustained with a 3U appliance with dual disk 
controllers with DSFS on Linux 2.6.X and 2.4.X kernels are:
975,000 pps @ 72     byte packets x 3 interfaces  = 180 MB/S stream to disk
445,000 pps @ 256   byte packets x 3 interfaces  = 339 MB/S stream to disk
208,000 pps @ 576   byte packets x 3 interfaces  = 360 MB/S stream to disk
119,000 pps @ 1024 byte packets x 3 interfaces  = 365 MB/S stream to disk
82,000   pps @ 1500 byte packets x 3 interfaces  = 370 MB/S stream to disk
The DSFS file system supports over 300 open source applications with 
high peformance stream to disk network forensic
storage capability and also supports SPAN,  Optical Splitter, and 
Asymmetric Routed configurations.  DSFS performs
stream merging and also exposes the captured data as native LIBPCAP 
files and virtual network interfaces which
allow seamless integration with Snort, tEthereal, and hundreds of open 
source Network Forsensic and Network Management
tools on Linux and Windows.    DSFS is the culmination of 2 years of 
intense development efforts by Solera Networks to create a
powerful platform infrastructure for the development of high performance 
network forensic open source applications on the Linux
Operating System.
DSFS is fully SMP enabled and supports Hyperthreaded architectures as 
well as native SMP.
