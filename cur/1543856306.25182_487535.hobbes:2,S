Hi all,
With the release of libata PATA support in 2.6.19, I am trying out  
libata with my HPT366 (built-on to motherboard), and it hangs at  
bootup while scanning for partitions. Additionally, it complains of  
abnormal status? Related information about my setup below:
- Abit BP6 motherboard running BIOS RV with HPT 1.28 (ie has  
functional ACPI DSDT table), has been recapped, not overclocked
- onboard HPT366 controller functions fine with the old IDE drivers  
(but only so long as I use UDMA mode <=3, mode 4 has reported  
problems on BP6)
- hard drive is an 80GB seagate 7200.1-ish that supports UDMA mode 5,  
partition scheme is (1-xfs, 2-swap)
- this hard drive is the only drive connected, but the kernel  
discovers one empty pata_piix controller and one empty pata_hpt366  
controller before it.
