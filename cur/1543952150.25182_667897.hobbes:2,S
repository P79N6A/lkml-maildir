Yes, they can share one page. 
I was afraid its page will be hard to remove yesterday.
If all sections' usemaps are allocated on section A,
the other sections (from B to Z) must be removed before section A.
If only one of them are busy, section A can't be removed.
So, I disliked its dependency.
But, I reconsidered it after reading your mail.
The node structures like pgdat has same feature.
If a section has pgdat for the node, it must wait for other section's
removing on the node. So, I'll try to keep same section about pgdat
and shared usemap page.
Anyway, thanks for your comments. 
Bye.
