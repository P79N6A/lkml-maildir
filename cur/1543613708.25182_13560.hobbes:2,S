No, this is generic, and is due to a recent patch (from -pre11 to -final)
 that should have made Linux more standards-compliant. Linus already
 reverted it in his tree so I assume the correctly-working shutdown
 sequence will work again in 2.5.2-preX. zdiff'ing -pre11 from -final
 patches I'd say it's this chunk (don't try to apply with 'patch', I
 just cut'n'pasted from my xterm):

I see the same behavior on RedHat 7.2.
