Ugh.  Is there a way to tell bisect to only work around the USB updates?
I suppose so.. just pick the commits before and after the USB dump
and let it pick through the middle.
Still, that'll take a few hours, and frankly I'm getting sick of having
to re-debug the USB layer with each new kernel rev.
Got a pointer to the "bisect how-to" ?
Thanks
