How is the background noise on this card?  I'm a bit skeptical for a $15
card...
I'm looking for something to replace my GUS Classic, now that OSS mmap()
emulation was removed from ALSA, and I can't play Quake and other things
with it anymore.
I resoldered my GUS Classic to remove the final mixer and get direct
preamp output, which made it have very high quality output.  With the
card playing nothing or playing silence, I can turn my Pioneer receiver
up to full volume and hear only very slight noise.
