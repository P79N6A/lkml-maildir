Actually, this is me goofing up. I did intend for all local variables to 
be grouped without a single blank line between them - just one blank line 
*after* the variable block - don't know how this bit snuck in. Thank you 
for catching that.

I'm fully aware that these patches are low-priority. I don't expect them 
to get anything but "at my convenience" treatment from you.
And should you miss some of them (I'll be sending you quite a few over the 
next few days I expect) I'll just queue them locally and resend at some 
later date (post next Linus release or so), so don't feel pressured to 
look at these if you don't have the time.
