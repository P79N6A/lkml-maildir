I'm just worried that once we establish the format, we can't really
change it.  We have enough room in the pseudo-pte now, but what happens
when the next group of people pop up that want something else from this
interface.  Right now we have normal memory, swap, and hugetlb pages.
What if people want migration ptes marked next?  I'm not sure those fit
into what you have here.
It all fits today, I'm just worried about tomorrow. :(

Is there any way to do unions of bitfields?  It seems a bit silly that
we have this bitfield, and then subdivide the bitfield for the swap
entries.

Could you make this work with other architectures' large pages as well?
I'd hate to leave ia64, MIPS and powerpc out in the cold.  powerpc at
least has large pmds, it just doesn't really expose them to generic
code.

Didn't you define a macro for this above?  Can you re-use it?

Why do we bother wasting space in paddr by shifting up the physical
address?  We know the bottom PAGE_SHIFT bits are empty, so doesn't this
just waste them?
The bitfields are nice, and I do see they've spread to generic code.
So, I won't object to them, but please do double-check that they don't
cause any problems, especially with compilers that you might not be
using.

I'm really not a fan of the #ifndef style for these headers.  I think it
makes it really hard to figure out where definitions come from.  
I do think it would be best to keep al the ppte stuff isolated to the
pagemap files as much as humanly possible.  There's not much of a reason
to pollute these generic (and already full) headers with our /proc
crap. :)

Could you investigate this a bit on the other architectures and perhaps
code up something that will at least compile on the others and not just
punt?  I just want to make sure that this approach can be extended to
them easily and we don't have to rewrite it. :)
My only other concern is that we're still wobbling on this interface and
it's about to get mainline-released.  Should we turn it off in mainline
so that we don't establish an ABI that we know we're going to change
shortly anyway?
