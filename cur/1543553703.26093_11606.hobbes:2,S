This sounds to me like the most flexible way to do it.  If the module accepts
parameters then those who want the sound card initialized at every load can put
the desired settings in modules.conf.  The rest of us can just initialize it
once at boot time and the rest of the time the settings will be left untouched.

Eh? You just load the driver once, probably on boot, to configure sane values.
This time round, you use an argument (or an ioctl or whatever) to specify the
values you want. (cat /etc/sysconfig/sound/defaultvolume > /dev/sound/mixer or
whatever). After that, the module can be unloaded and loaded as needed, without
any need to touch the mixer settings except in response to *explicit* "set
volume" commands from userspace.
