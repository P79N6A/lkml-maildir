So it does lock up again :(((
But now I was able to quickly switch to console and grab the contents of
/var/log/messages before it totally hanged. I can usually tell when the
hang is going to happen: activity on the array stops, then I have a few
more seconds till it hangs completely ....
The message was:
Jul 7 02:45:36 kalimero kernel: 3w-xxxx: scsi0: Unit #0:
command (f7618800) timed out, resetting card.
Then of course, the system totally hangs.
The same problem occurred to me on a Tyan S2468, with a different 3Ware
card. This has to be a kernel problem ... (or BIOS problem, if the S2468
and 2469 BIOSs are sufficiently similar ?).
thanks for any help,
Vincent
