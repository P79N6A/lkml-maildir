Here's an update to that patch, which is in MMOTM with the name
	rtc-avoid-legacy-drivers-with-generic-framework.patch
=======
This is a harsher fix for the problems of trying to make legacy
RTCs coexist with the generic RTC framework:  Just Don't Do It.
The legacy drivers are not geared towards coexistence; they
never had a reason to try.  So rather than accumulating more
and more special cases, and gently nudging users away from the
old code, make it be an either/or choice.
