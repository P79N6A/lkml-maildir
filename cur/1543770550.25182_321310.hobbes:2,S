Hard RT guarantee are very possible, not in years, but months (possibly
already) under constraints previously outlined.

No sane RT app person is going to call into the kernel and expect
guarantees in a general purpose system. Folks doing this kind of
RT work will have at least a path that they can follow to *possibly*
make this happen. It's all conjecture at the moment and it won't be
known until somebody takes a shot at it and all associated kernel
issues. It's most definitely a worthy project.
If this happens Linux would be an ideal kernel for digital video
recorders and such.
