Note that "fsuid" would _be_ the "struct ucred *" thing (but hopefully
renamed: "ucred" is a really bad name, since it has almost nothing to do
with the user, and has everything to do with VFS. I don't know where BSD
got the "u" from).
Think of "fsuid"  and "fsgid" as small special-case "filesystem
credentials" already - they're separate from the regular uid/gid because
they have different sharing semantics (uid/euid are visible to signals,
the FS credentials aren't).
So I dont' think that is a problem.
The issue about attaching additional credential information (both to the
user credentials _and_ to the VFS credentials) is true, though.
