I still wonder why you are so focused on ifdefs. Why would we need those?

Maybe the best thing would be to have proper atomic ops in UP mode on 
i386? The current way of just dropping the lock bit is the source of the 
troubles.

But we all try to contain them. Here we have i386 hacks multiplying 
all over the system.

Just adding a single line #include <asm/xen-bitops.h> to drivers that need 
this functionality is not an undue burden for the drivers that support 
Xen. They have to use special _xxx bitops anyways.
