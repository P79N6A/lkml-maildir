I don't think it's too intrusive, it just doesn't fit the 'strictly
bug fixes' definition.

Yes, that would work as well. FWIW, we currently have the following
nonstandard kmap types:
avr32: KM_PTE2 (unused)
frv: __KM_CACHE, __KM_PGD, __KM_ITLB_PTD, __KM_DTLB_PTD (unused
	except for __KM_CACHE)
powerpc: KM_PPC_SYNC_PAGE, KM_PPC_SYNC_ICACHE
It should be fair to introduce common types KM_DCACHE (__KM_CACHE
and KM_PPC_SYNC_PAGE) and KM_ICACHE (KM_PPC_SYNC_ICACHE) for these.

It's part of a larger series that I'm planning to submit for 2.6.29,
but I wouldn't mind if you take care of this file independently.
