I'm curious about the two entries in /proc/mounts:
rootfs and /dev/root.  Although I don't have much
experience with this, I've looked through some of the
kernel source code (e.g. fs/namespace.c or
init/do_mounts.c).  All I can come up with (actually,
this is pretty much what I thought before I looked at
any code) is that rootfs is purely a kernel-generated
filesystem.  The kernel creates the /dev/root device
there, and then mounts /dev/root at / (replacing
rootfs).
There were some mentions of 'initrd' too, so I'm not
sure if I'm confusing rootfs with an initrd.  Could
anyone clear this up for me?
