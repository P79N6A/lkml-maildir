You will never figure that out, it isn't predefined.  It reshapes itself on the
fly, and is really defined by what is going on at any given time.  That said,
it's usually possible to figure out how the main maintainers are, and what to
send where, just don't hope to ever nail that down in a rigid structure.  It's
not rigid.

By the way, that never was a secret to anybody in active development.

Right, people are working on solutions.  As usual, though much dung did fly,
Linus comes out smelling like a rose.
