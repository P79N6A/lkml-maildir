I don't get it. Why would different offsets in the libraries make any
difference to programs (or other libraries) ? Aren't they supposed to refer to
nice symbol tables in libc etc?
FWIW, I installed glibc-2.0.112 over glibc-2.0.111 over glibc 2.0.7pre6 without
trouble. The only weird thing was that immediately after installing, you cannot
execute any dynamically linked executables (which at least on a redhat system
essentially means everything but ldconfig: su, login, even init) because the
make install of glibc doesn't run ldconfig. This was a problem with the
glibc-2.0.7pre6 to glibc 2.0.111 install (I think it changed ld.so to point
somewhere else, but not the C libraries etc). But you run ldconfig, and
everything's fine.
