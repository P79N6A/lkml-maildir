This is serious - could you find out exactly what 2.3 kernel broke
this?

I have the same problem using kernel 2.3.25 (the first 2.3 kernel I ever
used). It is repeatable, as long as the aha1542 adapter is compiled in as 
a module. It does not occur when it is compiled in the kernel i/o a module.
I only have CDROM's attached to the scsi adapter so I don't know if this
happens harddrives too. The detection of scsi devices when the module is
inserted works flawlessy too. 
If you need more information regarding this bug, please drop me an email.
With regards,
Bram
