   Aren't these quoted results from *static* web page tests?
Specweb99 is part static part dynamic content.
   And didn't Linux use khttp?  If so, then unless NT is also using a
   kernel resident server, comparing these is perhaps useful for
   marketing but is not useful for engineering (and this is absolutely
   an engineering forum).
NT's IIS server runs certain portions of itself in privileged x86 mode
to push buffers into/outof the NT kernel subsystems directly.
   I'd be far more interested in seeing NT and Linux compared on something
   which uses http to get a 20 little CGI scripts which do nothing but say
   "I am script #18", and are implemented on both platforms as stand alone
   perl programs.
Guess what kind of things specweb99 does, very similar to what you
mention here :-)
   I think Linux is likely to smoke NT on that, but I'd like to know that.
   Any takers?
I think it's already been taken :-)
