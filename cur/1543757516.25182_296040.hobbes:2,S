You are right. Kernel balancer doesn't move around the irqs, unless it
has too many interrupts. The logic is moving around interrupts all the
time will not be good on caches. So, there is a threshold above which
the balancer start moving things around.
You should see them moving around if you do 'ping -f' or a big 'dd' from
the disk.
Thanks,
