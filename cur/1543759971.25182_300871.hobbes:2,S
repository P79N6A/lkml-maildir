In theory.  In practice on some platforms we need special compiler patches
which will never be accepted into gcc upstream or are restricted to
particular versions of tools.  Building crosstools is tricky and yet it
seems every moron really has to toll it's own from his private mouldy
collection of patches.  The whole tools stuff has become very much a
battlefield of it's own.
