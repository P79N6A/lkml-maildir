Yes I did<br>
 <br>
It's not that difficult: I've got SuSE 7.0 with xfree86 4.0.2 (SuSE<br>
packages) and Kernel 2.4.0 final. Take the nvidia 0.9-5 tarballs. Unpack<br>
them. Apply this patch (attached patch &lt; patch... from within the<br>
NVIDIA_kernel directory):<br>
<br>
Okay, if you try to compile it complains about some unmap stuff. <br>
<br>
Open nv.c<br>
<br>
Go to line 860. Remove all the lines from and including the else<br>
expression. Go some lines up and remove the if expression looking for<br>
the right kernel version. Now, you have the declaration for the 2.4.0<br>
kernel, right. <br>
 <br>
Save and exit<br>
<br>
Now do a make.<br>
<br>
For beeing sure copy the NVdriver to /lib/modules/2.4.0/video/NVdriver<br>
<br>
Try a modprobe NVdriver. With a lsmod it should appear now. Okay no<br>
configure X and glx as before.<br>
<br>
Works perfectly on my system<br>
<br>
Enjoy<br>
<br>
