Yes.

Hm. I checked the code once more: Why not? I always assumed that panic()
would be something bad, but OTHO it's often only something weird, ie we
should try to sync().
Something bad usually calls BUG(), followed by a hard lock-up on SMP ;)

Yes, it's happening, but it's nowhere documented.

I really don't know. If you send an ipi with disabled interrupts, you are
inches away from a lock-up.
Remember that if cpu0 runs with disabled interrupts, it has a reason to do
so: usually, it owns an interrupt spinlock. But this means that cpu1 could
be spinning for that spinlock [with disabled local interrupts]--> lock-up.
I'll write a patch and wait for an answer from Linus.
