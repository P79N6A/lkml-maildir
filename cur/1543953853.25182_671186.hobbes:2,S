Here are 2 patches against your current git tree that do:
	- fix UIO to work properly on ARM and other platforms
	- remove BUG in sysfs and add better debugging for attributes
	  that overflow the buffer provided by sysfs.  Andrew asked that
	  this patch go in now to help people out.
Both of these patches have been in -next and -mm for quite a while.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-2.6.git/
Patches will be sent as a follow-on to this message to lkml for people
to see.
thanks,
