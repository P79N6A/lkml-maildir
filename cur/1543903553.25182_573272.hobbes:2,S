Pentium D is based on the Pentium 4 (basically two P4 chips in one 
package), therefore that option would be the one you would want.
If it's not listed in the menu, then you pretty much have to go on what 
else is in there that's similar. Likely Pentium D should be added to the 
menu listing for Pentium 4 though.
