This should fix the aging bugs you introduced through the faulty cpp
expansion. This is hard to write for me, given any time somebody does
a ptep_clear_flush_young w/o manually cpp-expandin "|
mmu_notifier_age_page" after it, it's always a bug that needs fixing,
similar bugs can emerge with time for ptep_clear_flush too. What will
happen is that somebody will cleanup in 26+ and we'll remain with a
#ifdef KERNEL_VERSION() < 2.6.26 in ksm.c to call
mmu_notifier(invalidate_page) explicitly. Performance and
optimizations or unnecessary invalidate_page are a red-herring, it can
be fully optimized both ways. 99% of the time when somebody calls
ptep_clear_flush and ptep_clear_flush_young, the respective mmu
notifier can't be forgotten (and calling them once more even if a
later invalidate_range is invoked, is always safer and preferable than
not calling them at all) so I fail to see how this will not be cleaned
up eventually, the same way the tlb flushes have been cleaned up
already. Nevertheless I back your implementation and I'm not even
trying at changing it with the risk to slowdown merging.
