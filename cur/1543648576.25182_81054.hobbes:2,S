 It really needs a new interface for recvfile/copyfile/whatever
anyway, as you can only specify an off_t for the from fd at present.
 Also consider that if you have 2 network sockets you really want a
way to see which did the EAGAIN.
 Which leads to something like...
ssize_t copyfddata(int out_fd, off_t *offset, 
                   int in_fd,  off_t *offset, size_t count, int *in_errno);
...and another for the off64_t API, the errno thing looks crappy but I
think creating EREADAGAIN is even worse (and I just know that won't be
the last if it's done that way) ... unless you can think of another way.
