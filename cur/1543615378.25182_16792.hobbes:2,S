See other posting with examples of dramatic failures of
'slots in box, but dmi says none' and 'no slots, dmi says some'.
still think this is usable ? You're nuts.

You're solving a non-problem.
Some examples of target audience you're aiming for in your previous
mail were I believe..
o  The geek next door who wants to tinker and learn about the kernel.
   Said geek is going to learn a damn sight more currently than he will
   with a dumbed down pointy clicky "build me a kernel" button.
o  Aunt Tilley.
   Vendors already ship an array of kernels which should make it
   unnecessary for her to have to build a kernel.
If you still think world domination is going to appear by idiotproofing
the kernel build process, I think you're in for a surprise.
We have far bigger usability problems in userspace. The point is that
$newcomertolinux doesn't need to know what a kernel is, let alone
have to build one. They just see "Booting progress" "Log in" "Desktop".
