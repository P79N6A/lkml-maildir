No information about what cards you've tested and how you've tested them to confirm that your theory on 4-bit data is accurate.
unfortunately, i cant fill these gaps myself directly.  all i bring to
the table is proper integration with the common frameworks.  i'm
relying on the guys developing the drivers and the guys who actually
designed the hardware for information.  they tell me it doesnt work, i
just believe them ;).
Cliff should be able to enumerate the cards he has tested and the
issues he's run into.  i'll see if i cant get more in depth
information from the hardware guys beyond the documentation on the sdh
already available in the hardware manual (which i'm guessing has not
been enough to appease you).

that's fair.  i could actually be a gnome sitting outside in your
lawn.  you have no idea.
