In fact things don't work this way.  The list above stops short after
"add usb host controller devices"; the probe routines for host
controllers do not scan for USB hubs or other USB devices.  Instead
they are detected by a completely separate thread (khubd).

I gather the idea is to convert dev->sem to a mutex.  This idea had 
occurred to me a long time ago but I didn't pursue it because of the 
sheer number of places where dev->sem gets used, not to mention the 
lockdep problems.
You can't possibly solve the lockdep problems here with a simple-minded
approach like your DRIVER_NORMAL, DRIVER_PARENT, etc.  The device tree
is arbitrarily deep & wide, and there is at least one routine that
acquires the semaphores for _all_ the devices in the tree.  This fact
alone seems to preclude using lockdep for device locks.  (If there was 
a form of mutex_lock() that bypassed the lockdep checks, you could use 
it and avoid these issues.)
Deadlock is a serious consideration.  For the most part, routines 
locking devices do so along a single path in the tree.  For this simple 
case the rule is: Never acquire a parent's lock while holding the 
child's lock.
The routine that locks all the devices acquires the locks in order of 
device registration.  The idea here is that children are always 
registered _after_ their parents, so this should be compatible with the 
previous rule.  But there is a potential problem: device_move() can 
move an older child under a younger parent!
Right now we have no way to deal with this.  There has been some 
discussion of reordering the dpm_active list when a device is moved, 
but so far nothing has been done about it.
