Three bugs down, one to go...
- backlight poweroff from screensaver: WORKING
- power off on shutdown: RELIABLE
- detection of the DVD drive without a disk in it at boot: WORKING
- sound: hasn't worked since FC1...
ASUS 1681 Pentium-M, 512MB, 80GB, 1400x1050 screen
FC1 worked, clean install FC2 had display issues, upgrade to FC3 doesn't 
use full screen size and sound is totally NFG. I'm going to drop back to 
oss over the weekend and see if that helps.
If anyone cares, the relevant lspci, dmesg, lsmod, etc, etc, are at
   //216.238.38.194/nosound
and it will be up unless some development breaks it. I have posted this 
elsewhere, could see attaching all the cruft to a message for the whole 
list.
