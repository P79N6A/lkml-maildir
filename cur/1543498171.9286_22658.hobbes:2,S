Well..., I think that this partition was made under msdos. (It was made
about 3 years ago ^_^U )
With kernel 2.2.9
[root@gamera /root]# fdisk /dev/sdb
Command (m for help): p
Disk /dev/sdb: 64 heads, 32 sectors, 622 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 2048 * 512 bytes
   Device Boot    Start       End    Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sdb1   *         1       622    636912    6  FAT16
And with k2.0.36
[root@gamera /root]# fdisk /dev/sdb
Command (m for help): p
Disk /dev/sdb: 64 heads, 32 sectors, 622 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 2048 * 512 bytes
