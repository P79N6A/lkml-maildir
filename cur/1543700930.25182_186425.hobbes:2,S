Well, gigaherz is not the *only* important thing.
On 2x1GHz, 2GB/sec RAM bandwidth, fastest a single threaded task can
run is 1GHz, 2GB/sec. If you run two of them, it is 1GHz,
*1*GB/sec. So you still have effect similar to hyperthreading. And
yes, it can be measured.
stress runs two tasks walking over 10MB of memory, just for fun. Look:
[Lefik is dual-p3; according to you two mem stressers should run about
same speed as one of them. That's not the case:]
machek@lefik:~/misc$ ./stress tenmega
Process 1665 started at 1072522582.
machek@lefik:~/misc$ Process 1665 done at 1072522695 (113 sec).
machek@lefik:~/misc$ ./stress tenmega tenmega
Process 1669 started at 1072522722.
Process 1670 started at 1072522722.

Process 1669 done at 1072522903 (181 sec).

And yes, that machine does have two cpus:

So... even on normal SMP,
"task-on-other-cpu-slows-down-task-on-this-cpu" effect exists. Okay,
it is not as visible as on HT machine (50% slowdown), but its
definitely there.
