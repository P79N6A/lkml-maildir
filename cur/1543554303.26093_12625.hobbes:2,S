I am trying to setup my ALS 110 soundcard under my build of kernel
2.4.0-test10.
I have built in isapnp support and also the sb and opl3 drivers. 
The sb driver works fine other than complaining about a missing 16 bit
DMA (which I understand is missing from the card anyway). I can play
and record wav with no problems. I am still missing MIDI.
However, even though I pass opl3=0x388 on the Kernel command line all
I get is an isapnp panic.
Am I doing something silly or is there a bug? Is it a sound driver or
isapnp or kernel problem?
While trying to locate the problem I could not get any response from
/dev/sndstat.
% cat /dev/sndstat
cat: /dev/sndstat: No such device
Is it not supported in 2.4.0? I can't find the same info in the /proc filesystem.
The full dmesg extract that seems relevant is 
Linux version 2.4.0-test10 (root@HindleyHome) (gcc version 2.95.2 20000220 (Debian GNU/Linux)) #26 Fri Nov 3 18:08:00 GMT 2000

Thanks for the help
