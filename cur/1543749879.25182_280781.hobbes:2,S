Most of these are compile options to use/not use particular things/"features". Some were
used during debugging. It's a small thing, I'll delete.

WHAT ?!?!?!?  Then I get nice output that actually identifies each card when I have >1. 8^) Not a 
big thing, I'll delete.

So then I'd have to declare the end elements as:
void __iomem foo;
They are 32 bit values, so it's OK to assume that void __iomem is 32bits ?
FWIW I did run sparse and it didn't complain about the readX/writeX.....

Why is that ? Seems if kmalloc returns a void * and the left side is not, a casting is appropriate ?
