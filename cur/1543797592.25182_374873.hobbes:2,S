please send the output of cat /proc/interrupts, I'm worried you have
an issue due to interrupt sharing.  If it does fail again and is still
usable, please send the output of ethtool -d eth0, and ethtool -S
eth0. Also, is there any chance you can try the 6.2.15 driver from
http://prdownloads.sf.net/e1000
do you have a test to reproduce this?
Thanks, Jesse
