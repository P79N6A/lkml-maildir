That sounds fine. I wouldn't be adverse to doing that - but it would have 
to be independently of any other changes, and it would need to simmer for 
a while for out-of-tree drivers etc to notice (ie you should _not_ just 
introduce a new "DECLARE_MUTEX()" immediately to confuse things).
The patch could probably be fairly trivially generated with some trivial 
sed-script. Not that I'll take it at this point, but after the next 
release..
