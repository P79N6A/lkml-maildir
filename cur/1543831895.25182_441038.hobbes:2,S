you might have had a '.nfs0000*' file inthe directory which prevented rmmod
from working, but it was finally removed by the rm -rf.

I get this if the server spends too much time writing data back to the disks.
Doing this on the server fixed the problem for me :
# echo 50 25000 0 0 100 100 60 45 0 >/proc/sys/vm/bdflush

Was it on the same server and while other clients saw the server disappear ?

OK, similarly, it might be interesting to apply your patch to niner to see
if the rmmod error happens again.
