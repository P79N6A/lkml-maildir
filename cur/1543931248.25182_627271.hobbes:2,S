Validate as in check it's a valid string?  Okay, I see that.

Hmmm...  This is sounding very not-simple.  I don't know how to do this.  I
can probably guess the kernel side by looking at how SECCLASS_KEY is done, but
it sounds like it involves changes to the userspace policy processing tools
too.
It also sounds a bit like overkill, but if it's the right way then I guess it
has to be done.
What does the security class represent in this case?  And can it be generalised
to apply to non-cachefiles stuff too?

Definitely the latter.  I guess I wasn't very clear in the patch description.
It also sounds like I need to adjust the naming of certain functions.

 (1) You create a new task_security struct
 (2) You fill in the fsuid, fsgid, etc.
 (3) You request that the LSM security pointer in it be set to point to the
     context you want (at the moment this is done by attempting a transition
     from the daemon's context):
	ret = security_transition_sid(dtsec->sid, SECINITSID_KERNEL,
				      SECCLASS_PROCESS, &ksid);
     and, in the current code, it returns an error if you're not allowed to do
     that.  But instead you'd ask it to set a specific context, and it'd set
     that if you're permitted to do that, and give you an error if you're not.
 (4) You then use the task_security at will to override the task->act_as
     pointer in whatever task(s) you're operating on behalf of at the moment.
 (5) When you cease operating on the behalf of a task, you revert its act_as
     pointer and drop a reference to your task_security struct.
 (6) When the last ref to the task_security struct goes away, the LSM data
     attached to it is released, as are its groups and keyrings.

I know.  I thought about it quite a bit, but the problem is there's so much
overloading of various words (eg: security, context), and I wanted to avoid
struct cred for various other reasons.

Better still, perhaps, would be to prefix things with selinux_ to make it
namespace clean.
