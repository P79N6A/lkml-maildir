We tested on i386 as well at the time, and it looked like a tiny
improvement. But doing the statistics, it was in the noise. 
I have no numbers for x86_64 or ppc64.
If you have reason to believe that there could be regressions, we 
should indeed do the benchmarks.
Sidenote: The patches 1 -- 2b alone still make sense, so I would
vote not for delaying their inclusion until we can collect numbers
for all arches we care about to take a decision on patch 3.
Best,
