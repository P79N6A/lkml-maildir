Sorry I somehow thought you had it queued.
My patch makes parts of David's patch obsolete because he makes 
the code ifdef, but I remove the code completely. David also
does some other cleanups which still make sense. 
So I think the correct way is to apply my patch first and then David's
and just ignore all the rejects and refresh.  The result should be correct.
Basically after that only the core dump changes in David's patch should
be left over.
Can you do that or should I resubmit both patches in a merged form?
(I can do that too)
