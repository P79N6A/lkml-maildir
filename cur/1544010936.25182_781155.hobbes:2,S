Maybe you did just "make clean"? That leaves at least the "include/asm" 
symlink around. 
But maybe there is some other file that "make mrproper" doesn't actually 
remove and that gets generated with your 64-bit config or build, but not 
mine. You can always test with doing a
	git ls-files -o
to see if there are any "other" files (ie build-generated ones) around.
(On that same vein: I have taught my fingers to just do "git clean -dqfx" 
instead of "make distclean". Works with any git repository, and avoids any 
makefile bugs that leave generated files behind).
