I'm very happy to hear this ;).
I now have an update ready for Linus to merge that should fix the few
leftovers I had in the very first release of the vm rewrite but of
course I will be interested to hear about any regression/progression
about those changes, I'll post them in a few minutes in CC to l-k.
They're still untested on the >1G boxes but the oom problems weren't
specific to highmem so it should fix the highmem troubles too.
