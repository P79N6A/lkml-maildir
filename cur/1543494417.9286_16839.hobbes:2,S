sorry about my old post, i don´t saw it was an *old* info, but i like to
tell that many people still use un-updated software, and they´re
suceptible to this kind of attack. People reads Doc/Changes, but don´t
pay too much attention to the releases, or update just one or other
thing who don´t work just for him. Maybe this can be another alert to
those people.
Again, sorry to the old post.
