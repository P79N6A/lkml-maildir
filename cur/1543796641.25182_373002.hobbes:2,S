Hostap uses only encryption code, which was copied from - guess who -
hostap. Everything other must be done by the hostap driver itself.
bcm43xx can use - like every other driver - only constants and defines
from ieee80211.h. This is the reason why they are trying to implement
"softmac" on top of it. But that work was already done by Jouni.

I meant that every driver tries to implements its own "softmac". This is
not the way to go, right?

Heh? We have one nearly finished stack (and no, it's not the one in
kernel). Why should we try to implement a new stack instead of fixing
some issues of the nearly finished one?
