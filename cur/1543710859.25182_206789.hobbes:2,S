That is useful, thanks.  Sorry about the hassle.
Calling page_address_init() earlier isn't the fix though - pmd pages aren't
in highmem so we should never have got that far.  Looks like the pgd or the
pmd page contains garbage.  Did you try it without CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB?
Nick was seeing slab 0x6b patterns on the NUMAQ, inside the pmd, so there's
some consistency there.  We do have one early setup fix from Manfred, but
it's unlikely to cure this.
I'll have a play with your .config, see if I can reproduce it.  If not I'll
squeeze off -mm3 and would ask you to retest on that if poss.
