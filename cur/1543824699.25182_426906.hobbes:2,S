In Linux, the lowlevel driver registers irq handlers, so your simple 
problem has the simple and obvious answer.  Further, reviewing my 
statement above, if fbdev/DRM are aware of each other, and if they both 
are layered on top of the lowlevel driver, then it should also be 
obvious that they are cooperatively sharing resources, not competing 
against one another.

Take your pick.  An fbdev driver is nothing but a PCI driver that 
registers itself with the fbdev subsystem.  Ditto a DRM driver, though 
the DRM and agpgart layering is royally screwed up ATM.  Regardless, he 
who codes, wins.

No "hopefully."  X must be forced to use this driver, otherwise the 
system is unworkable.

If fbdev and DRM are cooperating, then obviously they will cooperate 
when managing resources.  GPU memory is but one example of a resource.

But if you think the kernel will grow an x86 emulator, you're dreaming. 
That's what initramfs and friends are for.
