Could do - if I can identify any unique register behaviour which
differentiates the ALS100 from the ALS200 then we can get the kernel to
properly identify the ALS200 as well.  You'll have to give me a few days to
dig up the code though :) - maybe by next week.  One question: what does the
current code identify your card as - an ALS100 or just SB16?
