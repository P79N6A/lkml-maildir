I suspect that this is leftover from the old code and I also think that
it can be removed completely.  However mixing too many real code changes
in a single patch is not a good practice and the removal can be handled
independently of the discussed patch.
If you would send me a patch with the above change I will be happy to
integrate it into pata tree (patch can be against current Linus' tree or
linux-next, either one is completely fine with me).

Indeed, removed.

Thanks for noticing this.  Fixed.

I think that despite code changes it stays valid so there is no urgent need
to touch it..

This is the right way to go and I has always advocated for it.  However
after seeing how libata got away with ignoring the issue altogether
I'm no longer sure of this.  I haven't seen any bug reports which would
indicate that simplified approach has any really negative consequences.
[ Still would be great to have the control over bandwitch of "queue-group"
  at the block layer level since we could also use it for distributing the
  available PCI[-E] bus bandwitch. ]

I think that having more information returned by ->request_fn() could be
beneficial to the block layer (independently whether we end up adding
support for "queue-groups" to the block layer or not) but this definitely
needs to be verified with Jens & James.

Thank you for your review.  v1->v2 interdiff below.
v2:
* Fixes/improvements based on review from Elias:
 - take as many requests off the queue as possible
 - remove now redundant BUG_ON()
