I'm using 2.6.11rc2 with the patch for some hours now and it seems as if 
it doesn't throw away bytes any more which makes linux 2.6 useable for 
me again - thanks a lot! I just encountered one smaller issue (this 
really is much better than before): The mouse just "jumped" once and 
then got back to normal immediately. This gives me the following message 
in /var/log/messages:
kernel: psmouse.c: bad data from KBC - bad parity
Any idea about this?
Regards,
Victor
