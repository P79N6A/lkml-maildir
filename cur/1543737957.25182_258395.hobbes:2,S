I came to the same conclusion a week ago when I realized that a patched
kernel did not compile on an opteron because of the exact same things I
had already fixed on i386 a few days before. Probably we could have a
generic x86 branch, with currently two variants : i386 and x86_64 ? I
don't know how to arrange this, though...
