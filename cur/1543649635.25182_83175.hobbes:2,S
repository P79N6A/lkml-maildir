First, I use ksh, so the kiddie is looking into the wrong history.   ;^)
Second, I'm trying to keep him/her/git out by not loading a trojaned package.  
Once the scumbag is inside your box, it's much harder to throw them out.  In 
fact, a reinstall is usually in order.
Third, if they don't do it already, I'd like kpackage, gnorpm, and similar 
tools to always check signatures before loading a package.  (And, for the GPG 
public keys used to have come with trust signatures from the installation 
CD.)  That would really help with all the newbies to *nix coming on board 
now.
PS:  If you don't trust your gpg or rpm, boot off install CD # 1, switch to a 
text console, and use the ones on the CD.  QED.    :^)
