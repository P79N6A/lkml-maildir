That's a very bad thing to do. It means that the ioctl number is different
between 32 and 64 bit and you need to write a conversion handler that
first reads your pointer and then then writes the real data.
Also, it needs to be at least _IOR() in the case you're describing,
because the pointer is read, not written (I hope).
