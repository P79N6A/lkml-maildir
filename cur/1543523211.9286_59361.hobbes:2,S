We can write this :
TS_old = Ko + O( N )
TS_new = Kn + O( log( N ) )
Where N is the RQ size.
Now the curve of TS_new( N ) goes down ( intersect ) the curve TS_old( N ) in a
point that in the worse case I've measured is N = 8 ( I prefer always to report
worse cases to avoid to be shooted ), but I've measured even 4 with a medium
that I can think to be near to six.

I'm working on a new version of my cluster scheduler that behave :
0 < N < Nx	TS( T ) = TS_old( T )
Nx <= N < INF	TS( T ) = TS_new( T )
I don't know if I'll succed but I'll try.
