Well, this is the ten thousand dollar question - why not indeed?  Pavel 
says "Problems are in drivers, and drivers are shared", but suspend2 
works around this by unloading certain drivers before suspending, and 
otherwise hacking around the difficulties.  This is, I think, what is 
meant when suspend2 is said to support scripting.  It may not be a 
pleasing approach from a theoretical standpoint, but it seems to be the 
only way to get a reliable implementation in a timely fashion -- 
reliable in the sense of being most likely to work on a randomly chosen 
machine without custom configuration.
