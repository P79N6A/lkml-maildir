Wish I remembered who had complained when I proposed to kill that copying...
It was introduced back in 2.1.110 and back then comment looked so:
+               /* Backed by a regular file - we need to hold onto
+                  a file structure for this file.  We'll use it to
+                  write to blocks that are not already present in
+                  a sparse file.  We create a new file structure
+                  based on the one passed to us via 'arg'.  This is
+                  to avoid changing the file structure that the
+                  caller is using */
+
I would be happy to get rid of that crap - it was the only reason why I
had to add the sodding file_moveto() and world would be better without it.
If we can kill it off - let's do it and let's take fs/file_table:file_moveto()
along.
IOW, I also think that copying the struct file is wrong. IIRC, complaints were
bogus - losetup requires enough priviliges to make worrying about security
implications somewhat pointless.
