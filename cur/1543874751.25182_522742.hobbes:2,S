Hi!
Today I heard fans running a bit too much. I checked with top, and got
no obvious power hog. And now acpi battery says:
root@amd:/data/l/zaurus/oz.spitz.3541# cat
/proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state
present:                 yes
capacity state:          ok
charging state:          discharging
present rate:            35248 mW
remaining capacity:      1850 mWh
present voltage:         14259 mV
...35W! This machine normally eats 14W.
Now it got better, I still see nothing at top... 22W. That's still 8W
more than it should be. What is going on?
								Pavel
