I've done a more thorough review of Liam's work and come up with a few
more fixes (which I'll publish later today), but more importantly, a
list of questions for the NFS/RPC people:
1. __nfs_revalidate_inode - with an error return from nfs_wait_on_inode(),
   shouldn't we go to out_nowait()?
2. nfs4_set_lock_task_retry - shouldn't we honour the fatal signal, and,
   say, set the timeout to MAXTIMEOUT?
3. Can we make nfs use rpc_wait_bit_killable()?  I think there's two places
   that exact function is duplicated.
4. Can we remove the 'action' parameter from
   __rpc_wait_for_completion_task()?  It's always NULL.
5. Should xprt_rdma_free be using wait_event_killable?
   Ditto rpcrdma_ep_connect and rpcrdma_ep_disconnect
I think we're going to find a lot of places where attention hasn't been
paid to the 'intr' case.  It's always been a wart, so I'm unsurprised it
doesn't get much testing.
