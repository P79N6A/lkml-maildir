The perl script that writes tables isn't too informative without knowing
how the tables are used.  Pseudocode that says exactly what your final
reference pattern is would be a lot more useful.  Just leave out the part
about generating the tables and express it as if you were computing the
distribution at the same time as generating the references, unless it's
really impossible to do that.  I don't think it's impossible to do that
in this case.
It would also be useful to state what you define as a reference.  A user
space program read-accesses a single byte from some address?
