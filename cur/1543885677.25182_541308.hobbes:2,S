I'm against it:
I don't have numbers, but I'd expect the vast majority of people 
building kernels to be people with low kernel knowledge building for an 
i386/x86_64 system.
OTOH, people developing embedded systems are most likely more familiar 
with kernel internals.
Kernel size doesn't matter that much for average desktop or server 
systems, and most things for possible space savings behind hidden behind 
EMBEDDED are things where you _really_ have to know what you are doing 
when playing with these options.
