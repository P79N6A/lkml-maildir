Tejun,
I tried 2.6.22-rc6-mm1 + your latest patch, and it failed to boot.
Unfortunately, the machine limped along and am unable to capture
the initial BUG or OOPS.  I'll try to get a serial connection set up for
debugging tomorrow, but I am very busy with other stuff.  It would be
great if you could test your own build with the .config file I initially sent
to you for the original BUG: issue.  If you would like me to resend the
.config, just let me know.
      Miles
