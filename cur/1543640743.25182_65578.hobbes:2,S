Well, it's not too easy any more to say "I am the Alan Cox client. Send me
naked children." If you were ever hit by that or similar, you'd certainly
think differently, once you've seen that these "tools" for IPv4 are
mainstream, while the tools for IPv6 are rather rare, and the fake packets
got discarded anyway. If they're unlikely to be discarded -- I can't 
agree. They just were.
