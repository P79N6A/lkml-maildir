No luck here. I'll give -mm2 a run just to 
full dmesg
with patch applied[1]:
http://oioio.altervista.org/linux/dmesg-2.6.18-rc6-mm1-fail-S3-2
without it (it's almost identical :)):
http://oioio.altervista.org/linux/dmesg-2.6.18-rc6-mm1-fail-S3
.config:
http://oioio.altervista.org/linux/config-2.6.18-rc6-mm1-3
[1]: I didn't rebuild fully, just applied the patch and re-run make
bzImage modules
