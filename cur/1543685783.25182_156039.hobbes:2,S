Yes so.  A SCHED_NORMAL task with priority n can execute even when a 
SCHED_FIFO/RR/SOFTRR task of priority n-1 is ready.  In the case of FIFO and 
RR we don't care because they're already unusable by normal users but in the 
case of SOFTRR it defeats the intended realtime gaurantee.

Are you sure?  I suppose that depends on the particular flavor of dynamic 
priority adjustment.  The last I saw, dynamic priority can adjust the task 
priority by 5 up or down.  If I'm wrong, please show me why and hopefully 
point at specific code.
On the other hand, this doesn't really matter, because the first problem above 
still exists, and causes the same result: attempted realtime scheduling that 
isn't.
