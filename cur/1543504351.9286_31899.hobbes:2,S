First of all, check for init_mm is wrong. Kernel threads have NULL
->mm now. Another thing being that you have a potential race here. Correct
way to do the thing:
static int get_mm_id(int pid, char * buffer)
{
	struct mm_struct *mm = get_mm(pid);
	int res = sprintf(buffer,"%lu\n", (unsigned long)mm);
	mmput(mm);
	return res;
}
and the rest as in your variant.
Cheers,
