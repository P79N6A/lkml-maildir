Subject: Have the 2.4 kernel memory management problems on large machines been fixed?

A few months ago, there was a flurry of reports from people having
difficulties with memory management on large machines (ia32 over 4 GB). I've
seen a lot of 2.4.x-yy kernels go by and much VM discussion, but what I'm
*not* seeing is reports of either catastrophic behavior or its absence on
large machines. I haven't had a chance to run my own test cases on the
2.4.18 kernel from Red Hat 7.3 yet, so I can't make any personal
contribution to this discussion.
