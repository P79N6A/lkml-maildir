"Major portions" ? Are you joking ???

Why you think kernel developers should think about this ? It's task for RedHat,
Caldera, SuSE management NOT for Linus, Cox, Viro or Arcangeli.

WHY ??? It's not possible with Windows, it's not possible with Solaris,
why it should be possible with Linux ?

Ok. So we do not have any OS that is anything other than an interesting
experiment.

In 2.2 or in 2.3 ??

Why not ? Why Microsoft can do this, Sun can do this and Linus can not ???
What's the difference ?

But if such components will be continue to change then Linux is in even
bigger heap of trouble since this will mean that you can not fix design
errors !

Drivers MUST be changed with new kernel release (and thus via development
branch: development kernels are just snapshots of development process after
all). It was true from the start and it'll be true tomorrow. It's true for
most OSes available. It's ESPECIALLY true for Linux where drivers are linked
directly in kernel. If you expected something other then you made wrong choice
choosing Linux.
