This is a misconception.  You use the same initrd to tftp a second
initrd.  If you really think there have to be differences at that level,
the in-kernel solution is going to need the same differences because
they do exactly the same thing.

A userspace ELF binary needn't be much larger than the equivalent kernel
code, if they're using the same API (syscalls).  With the new cramfs,
the ramdisk would actually be smaller than the kernel code because every
file is stored compressed.
Not that it matters.  A tftp client is a tiny program compared with the
kernel itself.

initrd contents:
   /linuxrc (one file)
linuxrc == executable which does tftp, then mounts a new ramdisk, then
runs /linuxrc on the new ramdisk.  Uses standard syscalls.  Contents of
/linuxrc more or less the same as the initrd-tftp code.
Results: exactly the same as initrd-tftp patch.
You can even debug the client before deploying it.
Doesn't get much crispier than that.

Have you /tried/ writing the userspace solution?

No, it's because those patches are totally unnecessary.  Good solutions,
and much more flexible ones, already exist in user space.  If you're
having trouble using initrd, then perhaps you should be supplying
patches to make initrd more friendly for embedded systems?

Sexiness is not the objection here.

This solution will not break from kernel version to kernel version as
it's based on standard APIs, unlike the in-kernel clients which do seem
to break whenever the network code breaks.  So, nicer to support :-)

That's your choice not to use the mechanism which /is/ supported for
this purpose: initrd.

These seem like reasonable things to go in if they're ready.

What you have is a significant number of kernel developers saying "use
what we've provided, it works fine".  It's up to you to prove us wrong,
by trying it and showing that it doesn't work.  You haven't done that.
Why not try porting the initrd-tftp client to linuxrc?
enjoy,
