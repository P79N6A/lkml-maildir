You can indeed not sleep in an rcu_read_lock() section. However, you
could grab a reference on an item, stop the iteration, drop
rcu_read_lock. Do you thing, re-acquire rcu_read_lock(), drop the ref,
and continue the iteration.
Also, how do you avoid referencing dead data with your sll? I haven't
actually looked at your patches, but the simple scheme you outlined
didn't handle the iteration + concurrent removal scenario:
thread 1             thread 2
 foo = ptr->next
 < schedule >
                     killme = ptr->next (same item)
                     ptr->next = ptr->next->next;
                     kfree(killme)
                     < schedule >
 foo->bar <-- *BANG*
