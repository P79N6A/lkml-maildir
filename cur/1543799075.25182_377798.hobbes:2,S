The proposed patch is for mm only. What you are gaining is wider  
testing of 4K stacks.
I am just a lurker but, having read the entire thread, it seems to me  
that:
1) the patch should be applied to mm.
2) ndiswrapper should be modified to work with 4K stacks.
It seems unlikely to me that this patch will be pushed to Linus just  
because it has been in mm.
If that possibility comes up in 6-12 months then the flamewar can  
begin again.

Felix
