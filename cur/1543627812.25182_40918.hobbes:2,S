  Alan has to be conservative, since he want to avoid giving potentially
damaging advice to someone. However, since you can take a reboot at your
convenience and schedule a year in advance, I still don't see the great
cost. If you have an app which must be up 7x24 and don't have seamless
backup you have other problems more serious than timer wrap.
