No, I don't think it is broken. The programming model used here is:
  check the relevant kernel data structures looking for a feature X;
  if (the feature is not found)
    request_module("feature-X");
  again check the relevant kernel data structures looking for X;
  if (still not found)
     return -EWHATEVERAPPROPRIATEFORTHISDRIVER;
Now, if the check for the feature is more than just some flag being set,
the above code can be optimized to save the second check if superfluous:
  check the relevant kernel data structures looking for a feature X;
  if (the feature is not found)
    if (request_module("feature-X") == 0)
      again check the relevant kernel data structures looking for X;
  if (not found)  
     return -EWHATEVERAPPROPRIATEFORTHISDRIVER;
see, the above does the second check only if the module successfully
loaded because there is no way for some feature to be added to the kernel
otherwise.
Therefore, to uniformly return -ENODEV would seem inappropriate, because
some places may decide to panic() if the feature is critical, others may
not even print a warning (e.g. looking for PPP compression) but just go on
working with reduced functionality.
Does this answer your question?
