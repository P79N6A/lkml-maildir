This won't work very well.  There's a lot of review work to be done here,
and a lot of it by busy architecture maintainers.  Expecting people to do
all this review and test work late in the merge window when they're all
madly scrambling to get their bugs^Wpatches into mainline is not reasonable.
This should all have started a month ago.
So we're looking at a 2.6.25 merge for this work.  After this round of
review has settled, please upissue the patches and keep linux-arch (cc'ed
here) copied on everything, thanks.
