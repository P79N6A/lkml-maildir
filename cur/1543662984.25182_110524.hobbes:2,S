FWIW, I can't get 2.5.59+ (maybe earlier) to run reliably for me
without spontaneous rebooting under load (kernel compile in a loop).
I wondered if it was specific to my system here except a few other
people have reported this on *very* different hardware (I'm have UP
Athlon with IDE, they have 8-way P4 with SCSI).
Is anyone else seeing this?  Might there be some bogon causing triple
faults or similar lurking that I'm just unlucky enough to hit often?
I note the 2.5.59-mjb4 seems pretty reliable and doesn't have this
problem...
