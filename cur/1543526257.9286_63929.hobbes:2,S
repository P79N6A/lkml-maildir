I am trying to make sure the lowlatency-2.2.14-B1 patch is stable.
My applications and test programs work fine with the released 2.2.14
kernel however Benno Senoner has a suite of tests which trigger
a lockup and sometimes Oops on my machine.  I switched to 2.2.14aa7 and
indeed it is more stable, now I only get stuck processes.
I installed ikd to track this bug down.  I am concerned that I am going
off on a tangent.  
1) Would it make more sense to port lowlatency-2.2.14-B1 to 2.2.15pre? and
test that combo?
2) I am using gcc version egcs-2.91.66 and I have noticed that Alan Cox
recommends gcc 2.7.2 for kernel compiles.  Should I switch?
