Hi Andrew:
I am maintaining a git tree for the hwmon subsystem now.  You may pull from
it here:
	git://lm-sensors.org/kernel/mhoffman/hwmon-2.6.git testing
The current contents include the remainder of Jean Delvare's quilt patch
series, plus a single patch to MAINTAINERS.  Once you start pulling from
this git tree, Jean said he will delete his patch series entirely.
BTW: None of these patches are needed before 2.6.23.
Thanks & regards,
PS: Thanks for your good work and help, Jean.
