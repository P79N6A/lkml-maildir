 for more info.
As noted, I tried it casually, got a kernel to boot and run, and decided
it wasn't a solution to problems I had at the time.

NBD = network block device
This allows a user-space program to publish a file which a kernel with
nbd enabled can mount as a device. So you should be able to run fdisk
and partition it, load stuff on it, and generally treat it like a drive.
Take a look at Documentation/nbd.txt, it may be exactly what you want to
provide a "block device" which can be on the same system using the
loopback interface.
