I think you have it fine already if you have a slab - as long as you
know you will run out of space and have some strategy to deal with
such boundary conditions. I was only reacting to your statement
"As long as the user is willing to pay the price in terms of memory"
I think you meant that a user could adjust the slab size on bootup etc,
but it is finite in size.
