	Just a thought, but from my understanding the author of
a piece of software can release that software under as many
licenses as s/he feels.  It is just that if a person recieves a
piece of code that is under the GPL they may not redistribute
that code under a different license (without first talking to the
author and making specific arrangements (which really mean
creating another specific license for the person who wishes to
redistribute the code under some other license) w/ him/her).
	So if the author released it under both licenses (I have
no idea), it would be permissable to have it in the kernel, from
what I understand.  It could also be, as someone else mentioned,
that you just can't have the kernel and those files linked into
the same binary, one has to be the kernel and the other has to
be compiled as a module...
