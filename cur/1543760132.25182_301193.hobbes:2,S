Very interesting zwane....i haven't tested the local APIC....do you
think this dispatch time can vary with the system I/O load (many
pending interrupts in the PIC)?
I think the interrupt latency is influenced even by the code inside
the kernel: if a lot of code is running with interrupts disabled then
the interrupt latency will grow. Am i right?
So probably we can state that the factors influencing the interrupt latency are:
1)Dispatching time in the PIC 
2)Waiting time on the PIC (if there are pending interrupt of lower vector)
3)fetching ISR from main memory
4)wait time when CPU is running with disabled interrupt
Do U agree?
Thank u very much
