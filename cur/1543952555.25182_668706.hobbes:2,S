Hi all,
I have created today's linux-next tree at
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sfr/linux-next.git
(tar balls at
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/sfr/linux-next/
).
You can see which trees have been included by looking in the Next/Trees
file in the source.  There are also quilt-import.log and merge.log files
in the Next directory.  Between each merge, the tree was built with
allmodconfig for both powerpc and x86_64.
There were a couple of merge conflicts (fairly trivial). (And the
expected build failure in st.c fixed by reverting the removal of struct
class_device.) Notification has been sent.
We are up to 48 trees, more are welcome (even if they are currently
empty).  The influx of new trees has been underwhelming.  Thanks to those
who have contributed, and to those who haven't, please do.
In particular, I have very few of the architecture trees ....
Status of my local build tests is at
http://kisskb.ellerman.id.au/linux-next.
  If maintainers want to give
advice about cross compilers/configs that work, we are always open to add
more builds.
