That just means you don't have to modify the bio_vec, there's still some
work to be done. But it should not be too hard, it's mainly updating the
merging checks. And grep for where PAGE_SIZE or PAGE_CACHE_SIZE is used
in fs/bio.c include/linux/bio.h block/ll_rw_blk.c

Eh no way, at least not if you want it merged. Lets not repeat the XFS
kiobuf IO disaster :-). If this is to be done and merged, it needs to be
integrated nicely with the current framework, not attached to the side.
