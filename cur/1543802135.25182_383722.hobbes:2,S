After the quick reading CPU Hotplug code I think you are right, there
is a bug in rcu_offline_cpu(). It should also move ->donelist, it is
lost otherwise.

rcu_move_batch() always adds entries to the ->nxttail, so I think
this patch is correct.

Yes, it is killed explicitly in rcu_offline_cpu() via tasklet_kill_immediate().
Note that we can't remove this tasklet_kill_immediate() and rely on
takeover_tasklets(). rcu_process_callbacks() does __get_cpu_var(),
so it can't find orphaned rcu_data anyway if the tasklet was moved
to another cpu.
So, do we need something like this (untested, uncompiled) patch or not?
