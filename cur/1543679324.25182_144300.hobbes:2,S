using 2.5.73-mm2, 1000HZ, patch-O1int-0306301522, patch-granularity-0306271314
"make -j16 bzImage modules" of a 2.5.73-mm2 tree makes XMMS skip easily, X is 
not very smooth, mouse jumps, X is sometimes not accepting anything for 5-10 
seconds every 1-2 minutes, everything freezes, also XMMS, Kmail freezes, an 
Xterm needs ~40 seconds to open. If the machine is totally idle, Kmail 
freezes also for ~5 seconds. Tried running X with 0, -1 and -11 w/o much 
difference.
I still like Felipe's O(1) patch.
Machine: Celeron 1,3GHz, 512MB RAM, 512MB SWAP, IDE (UDMA100), ext3fs, X4.3, 
WindowMaker.
Please, can we invite Ingo to this thread? I think it is now _really_ the time 
to get this fixed up :)
ciao, Marc
