Hi,
[please send comments per mail]
today it's quick-release-time. There's another version of the AMD Elan
patch available which adds Sven Geggus' driver for changing the CPU
frequency. See the latest patch on
  
http://www.pengutronix.de/software/elan_en.html
Please note that this is a very first and experimental version of this
driver. The API will most likely change to the cpufreq API from the ARM
architecture (Dave, I'll have a look at it tomorrow).
Robert
