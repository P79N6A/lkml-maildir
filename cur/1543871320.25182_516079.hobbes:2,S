In fact, with the relocate_vdso stuff it doesn't matter what VDSO_PRELINK
is at compile time.  It saves the small amount of startup cost if it
matches the runtime address, but that is probably not noticeable.

For everything else to work, it needs to be set by changing __FIXADDR_TOP,
which seems to be done by calling reserve_top_address early enough.
It looks like that needs to be properly tied into paravirt_ops somehow.
