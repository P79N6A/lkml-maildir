   depmod -ae gives unresolved symbols pci_dvma_v2p_hash (hadn't the
   PCI stuff been gouged out?) and empty_zero_page in: misc/ffb.o,
   net/skfp.o, scsi/sr_mod.o.
I don't get this with the default "arch/sparc64/defconfig"
configuration, and in fact I have used the FFB drm/dri driver.
Could you try that out?  That is what I test.  If that works for you,
we can then dissect what is different about the config you chose which
makes it fail.
It only builds as a module BTW, the drm.o archive is linked into the
"ffb.o" driver, which is why is appears to be build "non-modular".
