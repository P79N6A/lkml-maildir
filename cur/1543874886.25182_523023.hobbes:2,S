I'd like to mention what might be a new twist on this problem. We are 
seeing the same kind of 4k-block data corruption on multiple Tyan 
dual-Opteron boards (S3870) with a ServerWorks chipset, not Nvidia. I 
wonder if it really an Nvidia-specific issue. The Nvidia boards are a 
lot more popular, so maybe it's just more likely to be seen with Nvidia. 
I added a more detailed comment about this to the kernel bug report:
