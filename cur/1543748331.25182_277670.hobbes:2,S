Ah, my mistake, you have 40c cable connected to VIA not Promise...

If you are talking about:
ide3: BM-DMA at 0xd008-0xd00f, BIOS settings: hdg:pio, hdh:pio
it reports BIOS settings not the ones used by driver, no need for
"ide=dma2" if you have CONFIG_IDEDMA_PCI_AUTO=y.

It wouldn't, it must be another bug.
