I know.  kbuild 2.5 goes further and gives the user a choice about
(a) whether to run a script on install and (b) what the script name is,
instead of hard coding it.

Architecture dependent.  In kbuild 2.5 for most architectures the
default location for the kernel, System.map and .config is in
/lib/modules.
string 'Where to install the kernel' CONFIG_INSTALL_KERNEL_NAME "/lib/modules/KERNELRELEASE/vmlinuz"
bool 'Install System.map' CONFIG_INSTALL_SYSTEM_MAP
if [ "$CONFIG_INSTALL_SYSTEM_MAP" = "y" ]; then
  string '  Where to install System.map' CONFIG_INSTALL_SYSTEM_MAP_NAME "/lib/modules/KERNELRELEASE/System.map"
fi
bool 'Install .config' CONFIG_INSTALL_CONFIG
if [ "$CONFIG_INSTALL_CONFIG" = "y" ]; then
  string '  Where to install .config' CONFIG_INSTALL_CONFIG_NAME "/lib/modules/KERNELRELEASE/.config"
fi
Users with special requirements (old BIOS, small /lib etc.) can
configure their install to put the kernel where they like.  At least
one architecture (ia64) mandates that bootable images live in a
separate partition, the firmware on ia64 requires this, so the default
for vmlinuz is different.
string 'Where to install the kernel' CONFIG_INSTALL_KERNEL_NAME "/boot/efi/vmlinuz-KERNELRELEASE"

I was tempted, but the number of things that would break ... shudder.
