This concerns me deeply.  This is a current version of Grub which
shouldn't have any silly 8K limitations.  Yet it appears to have a
similar pathology over the ancient version Xudong just described.
The absolute best would be if we could replicate this in simulation
(Bochs or Qemu); this would make it very simple to debug.  Would you be
willing to try to do that?
