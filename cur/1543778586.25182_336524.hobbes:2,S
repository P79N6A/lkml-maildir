Subject: [RFC][PATCH] Make MAX_RT_PRIO and MAX_USER_RT_PRIO configurable
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/7/27/72

The following patch makes the MAX_RT_PRIO and MAX_USER_RT_PRIO
configurable from the make *config.  This is more of a proposal since
I'm not really sure where in Kconfig this would best fit. I don't see
why these options shouldn't be user configurable without going into the
kernel headers to change them.
Also, is there a way in the Kconfig to force the checking of
MAX_USER_RT_PRIO <= MAX_RT_PRIO?
