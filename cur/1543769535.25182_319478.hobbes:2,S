Your messages keep showing up as replies to other threads.  It looks 
like you're just hitting 'reply' to the latest message in your lkml 
mailbox in order to post a new message (at least the headers of your 
mail contain references to unrelated messages).  Please don't do this.  
Just create a new message with 'linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org' in the To 
field.  People will be more likely to see your message this way since 
it won't be buried in a thread they may or may not be interested in.
Thanks,
Jesse
