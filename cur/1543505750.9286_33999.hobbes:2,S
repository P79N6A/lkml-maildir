Subject: Possible 2.0.x connect() bug

I have some code which does the following:
1) create a TCP socket with socket()
2) attempts to connect with connect()
3) If the connect() failed with errno set to ECONNREFUSED, waits 2 seconds and
tries again
With the 2.0.5 and 2.0.10 kernels, the 2nd connect() call fails with errno set
to EINVAL. 
I have hacked the code to close the socket and open a new one before retrying,
and that works.
What I would like to know is, is this bug or a feature?
