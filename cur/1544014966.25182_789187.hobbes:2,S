My point is to use Gigabit links or 10Gb links and hundred or thousand of flows :)
But if it doesnt work on a single flow, it wont work on many :)
I tried my test program with a Gb link, one flow, and got splice() calls returns 23000 bytes
in average, using a litle too much of CPU : If poll() could wait a litle bit more, CPU
could be available for other tasks.
If the application uses setsockopt(sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVLOWAT, [32768], 4), it
would be good if kernel was smart enough and could reduce number of wakeups.
(Next blocking point is the fixed limit of 16 pages per pipe, but thats another story)

Of course we cant remove the test totally, but change the logic so that several skb
might be used/consumed per tcp_recvmsg() call, like your patch did for splice()
Lets focus on functional changes, not on implementation details :)
