I dont think thats true

Of course the card might be buggy too
The big problem with VIA is not that their hardware has bugs. Everyone has
bugs. I can get a problem with an intel chipset go to developer.intel.com and
generally get a straight answer and often a workaround. That makes me happy.
The problem isnt the bug, its not being given honest info on it.
If VIA had public errata that said things like 'Prefetch bursts can cause
problems unless you set bit 3 of blah' well we'd be able to evaluate the 
performance impacts and people could make sensible decisions and have 
reliable code.
Intel are not perfect either. We have a whole pile of laptops that crash when
speedstep triggers a trap we cannot handle. We have an APIC problem that took
much effort because they refused to help.
When vendors do help life gets a lot easier. AMD USB was a problem due to 
errata. Once they published the fixes AMD USB ceased to be a problem.
