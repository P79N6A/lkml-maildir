Okay, sounds like time to run these tests and post the results myself.
Hans, these things should be part of your standard QA. It would likely
make a better impression if there were some record of these kinds of
things having been successfully tested prior to your releases. For
future reference, Andrew, Christoph, myself, and others can provide
more detailed references to suites of stress tests and various kinds of
tests filesystems should pass before being considered stable, and we
(it's a relatively safe presumption that I speak for all of us when I
say this) would appreciate this kind of testing in the future.
