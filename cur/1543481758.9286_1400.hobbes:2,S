Can I suggest something different for all these cases. You can tell
egcs something is packed and may not be suitably aligned as an attribute.
Use that instead. Let the compiler do the brainwork.

Its too slow doing this. Don't inflict damage on the major platforms
because the Alpha has some problems with alignment. Again this is where
the alignment hints of egcs will help
