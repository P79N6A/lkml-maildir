If we take the load avg analogy a bit further, we should be able to spot
trends, at least to a limited extent: if the short term allocation rate is
higher than the long term, there's an increasing trend, so we should
probably try to keep more.
Tracking something like the last minute - as presently - but divided into
"last 30 seconds" and "previous 30 seconds" would probably help here; take
the first minus the second (rate of "acceleration") and add to the first,
and divide by 30. Use 32 for speed, perhaps, making it:
((a << 1) - b) >> 5
Should be an easy enough change, and a slightly better metric than just a
simple average?

With a reasonable "guess" based on recent history, we should be able to
keep enough around to handle most circumstances.
