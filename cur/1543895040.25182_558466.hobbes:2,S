How the hell does that improve the situation for users?  Alexandre,
please realize that you are preaching to non-believers.  I realize
that you have accepted the FSF credo, but if you want that conversation
to go anywhere you have to separate the things you believe in from
the things you can rationally explain.  Apologetics of your variety is 
not going to cut it.  _Can_ you separate the things relying on your
beliefs from the things that can stand on their own?  If you can't
do that, please stop wasting everyone's time and bandwidth.  It's
a secular maillist; what any of us might happen to believe in is personal
and frankly, none of your damn business.
