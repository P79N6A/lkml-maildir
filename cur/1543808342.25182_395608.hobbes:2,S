But I've explained that they only matter for people using it in stupid ways.
fsync also poses a performance problem for programs that call it after every
write(2).

The system call indicates to the kernel that IO submission should be started.
The earlier the kernel does that, the better (because it is likely that an
MS_SYNC is coming soon).
I think the current way of just moving the dirty bits is half-assed.
Is a more efficient implementation know-problematic? What applications did
you observe problems with, can you remember? Because the current behaviour
is also known-problematic for linux@horizon.com (who are you anyway?)
