if by 'some CPUs' you mean x86 then it's the LOCK prefixed ops that are
expensive. I.e. all the LOCK-prefixed RMW variants of instructions:
 atomic.h:               LOCK "addl %1,%0"
 atomic.h:               LOCK "subl %1,%0"
 atomic.h:               LOCK "subl %2,%0; sete %1"
 atomic.h:               LOCK "incl %0"
 atomic.h:               LOCK "decl %0"
 atomic.h:               LOCK "decl %0; sete %1"
 atomic.h:               LOCK "incl %0; sete %1"
 atomic.h:               LOCK "addl %2,%0; sets %1"
 atomic.h:               LOCK "xaddl %0, %1;"
 atomic.h:__asm__ __volatile__(LOCK "andl %0,%1" \
 atomic.h:__asm__ __volatile__(LOCK "orl %0,%1" \
pure reads/writes are architecturally guaranteed to be atomic (so
atomic.h uses them, not some fancy instruction) and they are (/better
be) fast.
interestingly, the x86 spinlock implementation uses a LOCK-ed
instruction only on acquire - it uses a simple atomic write (and
implicit barrier assumption) on the way out:
 #define spin_unlock_string \
         "movb $1,%0" \
                 :"=m" (lock->slock) : : "memory"
no LOCK prefix. Due to this spinlocks can sometimes be _cheaper_ than
doing the same via atomic inc/dec.
