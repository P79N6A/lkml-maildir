Dave, Zach,
thanks for your help, I've implemented a file descriptor passing mechanism
very similar to that of Zach's and it worked.
The problem now is performance, fd passing is utterly slow!
On my system (a 1GHz Pentium III + 2G RAM) I can do 1300 SpecWeb99 with a
khttp-like socket passing mechanism, while I only get something like 500 using
file descriptor passing. Indeed with fd passing I decrease Apache's
performance instead of increasing it!
I've checked my code several times and I don't believe that I have introduced
any specific bottleneck of my own (the code actually is quite trivial).
I've profiled the kernel and some interesting differences show:
With direct socket passing, 1300 SpecWeb load:

Zach, have you ever noticed such a performance bottleneck in your phhttpd?
SpecWeb has about 30% of its load as dynamic requests, so the amount of
forwarding is definitively significative in my case. Sime time ago I measured
khttp's impact in socket passing and I found that it was negligible
(forwarding everything to Apache instead of having it directly listening on
the socket had an impact of a few percent).
My impression from a first look to the profiling data is that the kernel is
doing a very poor job of scheduling and is ping-ponging between processes...
like it is not doing any buffering whatsoever and it is doing a contect switch
for every passed file descriptor.
Any thoughts?
