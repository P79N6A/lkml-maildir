That I'm aware of, Semprons have smaller L2 caches. You want an Athlon.

I've not seen this, but my understanding is that AMD's PR numbering scheme 
can't be used to compare between processor lines. i.e., a Sempron 3000+ is 
not faster than an Athlon 2800+..

Should just work. I've seen Linux booted on an AM2 board, but I don't 
currently own one.
