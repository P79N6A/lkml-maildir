The main use case is when you open a file requester on a network
file system where the server is down and you get tired of waiting
and press "Cancel" it should abort the hanging IO immediately.
At least I would appreciate such a feature sometimes.
e.g. the readdir loop could be a syslet (are they powerful
enough to allocate memory for a arbitary sized directory? Probably not) 
and then the cancel button could async_cancel() it.
