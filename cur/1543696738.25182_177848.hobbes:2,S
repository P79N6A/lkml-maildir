Don't forget: you also need to open the device with "O_NONBLOCK", so as to 
not make the kernel try to figure out the media etc. Otherwise you can't 
do anything with media that the kernel can't figure out (ie empty media 
that hasn't been written to, or even no media at all).
Depending on what your tool is for, this may or may not be a problem, of 
course. If you only want to send commands to a drive that already has a 
readable media in it, you can skip the O_NONBLOCK.
