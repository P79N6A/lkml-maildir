Thanks for tracking this down.
Hm, we must be actually checking the return value somewhere, and dying
because of it.  Let me dig deeper and find out.
Oh, can you enable debugging for the driver core (it's a config option)
and the USB core and without that patch reverted, let me know what the
syslog shows when the probe fails?

No, you should not have to call that from your driver.  In looking at
your code, I don't see anything obviously wrong.  It works just fine
with 2.6.12, right?

Does that also work with 2.6.12?
