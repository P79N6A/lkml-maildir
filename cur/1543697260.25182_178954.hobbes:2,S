Subject: [PATCH] Fix Oopsable condition in sys_close() w/ POSIX locks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Marcelo,
  If 2 processes that have been created using CLONE_FILES so that they
share the same POSIX locks both call sys_close() on descriptors that
point to the same inode (but have different struct file *), they can
end up racing in the function locks_remove_posix().
  This race may cause fl->fl_file to disappear while we are flushing
out pending writes in the nfs_lock() function, and so causes Oopses
when we get to nlmclnt_call() & co.
Cheers,
  Trond
