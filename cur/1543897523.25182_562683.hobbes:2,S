No, none of the XFS allocation modes do that.
XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP, which does write zeros to disk, only allocates and
writes zeros in the range between the old file size and the new file size.
XFS_IOC_RESVSP, which alocates unwritten extents, only allocates
where extents do not currently exist. It does not zero existing
extents.
IOWs, you can't overwrite existing data with XFS preallocation.
Cheers,
Dave.
