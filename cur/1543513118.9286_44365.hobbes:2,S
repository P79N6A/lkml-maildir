  Not to mention protection about misconfigured boxes that still sit on
wrong addresses while other boxes who have those addresses are being
rebooted. If ifconfig will refuse to configure on those addresses (instead
of just complaining to syslog or stderr), box will remain with no
configured interfaces even when misconfigured box will be disconnected or
reconfigured. Not nice.
