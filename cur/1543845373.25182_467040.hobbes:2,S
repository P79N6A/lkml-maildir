Hello.
I boot on an SATA drive,
with this kernel:2.6.12-12mdk .
Here is an lspci on my sata controler:
"

I have tried to compile and install the latest kernel: 2.6.18,
and I can't boot.
I have found a little difference in log between this kernel:
in 2.6.18, I haven't a line "PCI: Via IRQ fixup for 0000:01:08.0, from 11 to 
0",
I have this choice for the irq on 2.6.18:
"sata_via(0000:01:08.0): routed to hard irq line 11"
and after these errors:
"ata 1.00 : qc timeout (cmd 0xec)
..
ata 1: port is slow to respond
Kernel panic
".
I have this from the first kernel (v2.6.12)  in syslog:
"Sep 26 12:15:38 mybox kernel: PCI: Via IRQ fixup for 0000:01:08.0, from 11 to 
0"
"Sep 26 12:15:38 mybox kernel: sata_via(0000:01:08.0): routed to hard irq line 
0"
So, in the file quirks.c from 2.6.18 kernel,
I have added this line
"
DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_ENABLE(PCI_VENDOR_ID_VIA, PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_8237_SATA, 
quirk_via_irq);"
I have still the same error:
Via IRQ fixup is applied but it is impossible to boot,
even with append=" acpi=off pci=biosirq " in lilo.conf.
Thanks!
