It is means that the patch incorrectly moves internal kernel
synchronization
problem into user space as EIO instead of fixing a root cause or perform
iterative
synchronization.
After patching users will be surprised a lot of EIO
(remember 47% EIO in aio-stress runs after patching) will buy new
disk...
This patch is harmful.
