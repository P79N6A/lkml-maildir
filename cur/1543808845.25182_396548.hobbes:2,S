Even in this case, this was a deficit from Linux.
On Solaris, adding a new controler always asigns this new controler a new
higher ID (except for the case when the sysadmin explicitly requests different 
behavior). On Linux a sysadmin needs to know how the evaluation works....
And BTW: if a sysadmin does not know how things work on Linux and thus
causes a remapping, all /etc/vfstab entries would be void. So you are talking 
about a major fault that should be avoided under all circumstances.
