One thing I notice in pata_serverworks.c is the lack of an ->irq_clear() 
hook, which is called unconditionally in ata_device_add().  It's a bit 
strange that it wasn't caught before, since ->irq_clear() has been 
called unconditionally for a great many kernel releases.
Diego, does the attached patch help?
