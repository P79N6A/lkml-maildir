Hi...
I has tried to compile the latest stable kernel (2.6.23.13) with the
iwlwifi-1.2.23 driver and the mac80211-10.0.4 framework. I has
patched the kernel source tree and when I start menuconfig, it was fine.
If I started to run make, nothing seems to be wrong, but the iwl3945
module was not build.
I don't know why this module doesn't build anymore!
On kernel 2.6.23.12 with iwlwifi-1.1.19 and mac80211-9.0.3 I has no
problems like above.
regards
Mario
