Well, this value was chosen because it matches what the hardware does
: as explained in the comments, the hardware generates exactly 5
events for the first keypress (spaced by ~50ms if I recall correctly).
At least on my hardware (=> Vendor=0bc7 ProdID=0004 Rev= 1.00), the
current default value match exactly what I'm expecting (never had the
problem : "if you do anything but barely tap the button you can get
multiple events reported").
Just a thought : perhaps some models are more sensitive than others
(and so the default should be made dependent on the exact remote
model)... what is your hardware id ?
Best regards,
Vincent
