Check out:
http://samba.org/~anton/linux/struct_page/
"struct page can be hazardous to your health"
On this machine (2 way power3) we see a ~5% improvement on dbench by
removing ->zone. Quite a nice improvement.
When we also remove ->virtual and use pointer arithmetic to do
page_address() performance drops back down. The reason for this can
be found in:
http://samba.org/~anton/linux/struct_page/2.4.18pre1-nopagezone-nopagevirtual/2/6.html
Search for divd, remembering the percentage to the left is shifted one
instruction down. Yes divides really hurt.
Basically the difference is:
page_address() using page->virtual:
        ld 25,112(31)
page_address() using pointer arithmetic:
.LC1:
        .quad   mem_map
.LC2:
        .quad   0xc000000000000000
...
        ld 9,.LC1
        li 11,120		; sizeof(struct page)
        ld 10,.LC2
        ld 0,0(9)
        subf 0,0,31
        divd 0,0,11
        sldi 0,0,12
        add 25,0,10
Perhaps the compiler should be optimising this better (can we replace
the divide?)
