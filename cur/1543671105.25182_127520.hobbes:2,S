Last month, you sounded different:

Can you give me an explanation that changed with regard to the
kmod/ptrace fix?
Im private discussuion this possible scenario has been brought up:

AFAICS, ptrace_attach() will abort, because the "setuid back" does
not set mm->dumpable back to 1, it is left at 0 and ptrace_attach()
aborts then.
Of course you could do an exec() to get a new mm and then, you may
get an mm->dumpable is set != 0.
But especially in the case of an exec() I think the setuid program
should not go back to the original uid because the user may send
any signal it wants to the suid program then, read it's environment
and do all other sorts of bad stuff e.g. if the program is stupid
enough to not use a safe directory for temp files and such.
If we really need to protect such (IMHO insecure) progam to be
somewhat more secure, we could inherit task_dumpable over exec's,
but I'm not sure what kind of side effects whis would have when
using programs like su and login...
I think by adding such workarounds which are unrelated to kmod,
we would introduce more unwanted side effects insted of fixing
what we alread have because of too strong checks.
