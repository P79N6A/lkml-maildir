am i correct that you are referring to this patch?:
   
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0011.3/0861.html
was this the first iteration of your patch? Your mail is a little more
than 1 year old. You rated the patch as: 'The fix below is kind of
gross.'. Clearly, this does not help getting patches applied.
the ext2 bh-handling code had cleanliness issues before. I had ext2
patches rejected by Linus because they kept the method of passing around
double-pointers, and i have to agree that the code was far from clean. Al
did lots of cleanups in this area, and i think he fixed this issue as
well, didnt he? So where is the problem exactly, does 2.4 still have this
bug?
in terms of 2.2 and 2.0, you should contact the respective maintainers.
