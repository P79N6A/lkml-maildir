Could anyone help me on below questions:
1. Where is IKD for 2.0.32?
I can only find patch for 2.1.xx or 2.2.xx versions. Does it mean I can
use any of them for my working version 2.0.32?

2. What is the difference between zImage and vmlinuz? Is zImage only for
booting purpose, no matter whether you use xkdebug or remote debugging
over serial console?
3. I wrote a system call, which I can invoke via syscall(). How can I make
a normal lib function in Linux?
4. I wrote a simple server process using socket. Where I can init it as a
daemon? I already know how to use socket inside kernel since kernel can
not make syscall.
thanks
