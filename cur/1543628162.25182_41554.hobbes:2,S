I disagree -- Andrew Morton and Al Viro don't sent patches to Linus via
BK, AFAIK, and their patches are getting in.
Another example, Jean Tourrhes (sp?), the wireless and IrDA guy.  I have
agreed to become his "patch penguin", which IMHO has already translated
into less resends for Jean through my and Linus's use of BK.  He sends
GNU patches, so his process is unchanged, he only sees patches _not_
getting dropped[1].
And a further counter-example (to my shame), Anton A. sent me a BK patch
during Linus's vacation, and I have not yet sent it forward, showing
that BK doesn't necessarily imply auto-approval.

[1] of course there is often a Garzik-delay :) but I don't drop patches
