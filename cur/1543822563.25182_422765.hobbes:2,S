Reboot the client or the server?

Sounds like the server has locked up.
What does 'ps' on the server show for 'lockd'?  Is it in 'D'?  What is
the 'wchan'?  Are any 'nfsd's permanently in 'D'?
Try
 echo t > /proc/sysrq-trigger
and see what the stack trace for lockd is - probably only useful if it
is in 'D'.
Maybe a 'tcpdump -s 1500' of traffic between client and server would
help.
