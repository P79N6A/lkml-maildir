i think the problem is that local APIC 'self vectors' might be 
edge-triggered by default. I'm not exactly sure whether passing in 
APIC_INT_LEVELTRIG to send_IPI_self() will truly be interpreted by the 
local APIC into any external IO-APIC ACK sequence (the local APIC might 
just treat self-vectors as always-edge) - and it might also be that the 
pure act of mixing self-triggered vectors with level-triggered external 
irqs sometimes confuses the IO-APIC <-> local-APIC messaging. One more 
test of the patch below will tell us a bit more about this part of the 
story.
