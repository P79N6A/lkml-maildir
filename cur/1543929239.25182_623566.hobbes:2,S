Even ignoring the fact that it's unclear whether distributing modules 
with not GPLv2 compatible licences is legal at all or might bring you in 
jail, your statement has an interesting implication:
Stuff like e.g. the EXPORT_SYMBOL(sk_alloc) predates the 
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL stuff.
Who is considered the author of this code?
And when should he state whether he prefers to use EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL 
but wasn't able to use it at that when he wrote it since his code 
predates it and is glad to be able to decide this now?
