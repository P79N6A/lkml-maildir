Salve,
	Recently I've compiled two 2.4.0 series kernels: test4 and
test7. However, I can't use them at all -- they're starting with this
error:
kernel: get_random_bytes called before random device initialization.
	The whole screen (and more, more...) gets filled with this
information.
	I'm not a kernel-hacker nor a c-programmer, but I managed to
recompile kernel with modified get_random_bytes procedure. Basically, i've
replaced printk call with return call. Then, after recompiling and reboot,
the system has hung. I was able to read what was before this error: IrDA
protocol was starting (and, obviously, it didn't started). 
	Now I've made whole IrDA part of the kernel as a modules and will
check if this works (kernel won't load the irda drivers on startup, but
later I must do it manually).
	Voila! After reboot: 
Linux kanton 2.4.0-test7 #7 sob wrz 2 12:03:36 CEST 2000 i686 unknown
	So... I'm reporting this to this list, because I don't know whom
to contact: IrDA folks, or maybe kernel's?
Greetings (and excuse my language bugs)
