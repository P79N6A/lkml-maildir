Hello,
some questions to the thread programming gurus out there:
For the implementation of a Virtual Machine with a garbage collector,
I would need the ability to stop all threads _except_ the thread doing
the gc for me. How would You proceed? I know this might be possible by
setting the thread to SCHED_FIFO and then giving it the highest
priority, but that would require the process to run suid root, which I
would like to avoid. Any suggestions are welcome, as would be advice
for the proper implementation of suspend() and resume() function calls
for threads (which would make possible the implementation of the
above). 
TIA,
	H.
