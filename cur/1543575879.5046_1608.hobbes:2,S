"buf, buffers, type, version" (of what ?) with FreeBSD kernel (if they
still exist), but they are global variables, not macros.
By the way, SYM-2, that is "FreeBSD sym back to Linux but still in
FreeBSD":), clashed on Linux "current" as well. Reason is that the
corresponding code was based on yours :)  (as indicated in the sym driver
source). I have changed "current" by "curr". This is as clear and has the
advantage of scaling better with "user" and "goal" (4 characters each).
   tinfo.goal
   tinfo.user
   tinfo.curr
Just a suggestion.
  Gérard.
