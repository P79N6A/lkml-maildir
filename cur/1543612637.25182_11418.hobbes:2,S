I'm responsible for the release locking changes.  But, I don't think 
that the problems are a result of those changes.  There have been some 
other patches that might have caused the problem.  Take a look at this 
thread:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=100745930928683&w=2
Jens Axboe posted a patch.  I asked him:

bio_alloc() not waiting on the reserved pool for free entries, even
though __GFP_WAIT was set. No need for __GFP_IO in that case too.
Udo, did you apply the patch that Jens sent?
