uh-oh.  SQL server?

The problem here isn't related to truncate or direct-IO.  It's just
plain-old MAP_SHARED.  nonlinear VMAs are now using the old-style
dirty-memory management.  msync() is basically a no-op and the code is
wildly tricky and pretty much untested.  The chances that we broke it are
considerable.
