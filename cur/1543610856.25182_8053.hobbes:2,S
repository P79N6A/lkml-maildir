Subject: a nohup-like interface to cpu affinity

Robert and Ingo,
A nohup-like interface to the cpu affinity service would be useful.  It 
could work like the
following example:
    $ cpuselect -c 1,3-5 gcc -c module.c
which would restrict this instantiation of gcc and all of its children to 
cpus 1,3,4, and 5.  This
tool can be implemented in a few lines of C, with either /proc or syscall 
as the underlying
implementation.
On another subject -- capabilities -- any process should be able to reduce 
the number of
cpus in its own cpu affinity mask without any special permission.  To add 
cpus to a
reduced mask, or to change the cpu affinity mask of other processes, should 
require
the appropriate capability, be it CAP_SYS_NICE, CAP_SYS_ADMIN, or whatever
is decided.
