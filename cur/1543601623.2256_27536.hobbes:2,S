Testing it is ok, its rolling the "patch" into production kernels that im
most concerned about.
What happens if the bit happens to fiddle with motherboard voltages and
you end up destroying peoples hardware...
Until we have a straight answer what the hell this bit does, its a very
bad idea to put it into *production kernel*.
We definitely need more data points too. So far we dont have any athlon.c
data for kt133a with the bit on and off, only kt133.
