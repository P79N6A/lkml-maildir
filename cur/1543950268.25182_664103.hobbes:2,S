Give them a LD_PRELOADable DSO that intercepts signal() and sig_action(), 
installing a trampoline that first does "cld" and then jumps to the real 
handler.  That ought to be a quick test if it's this or a different issue.  
A hack, yes, but well... :)

Many bugs are a big issue to people who actually hit them, and we had (and 
probably still have) far nastier corner case miscompilations here and 
there and nevertheless released.  It never was the end of the world :)
Let it be a data point that nobody noticed the problem which existed in 
trunk since more than a year (since 2006-12-06 to be precise).
Ciao,
Michael.
