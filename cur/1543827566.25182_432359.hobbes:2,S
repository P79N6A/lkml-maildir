I think the confusion here is that the target doesn't need to be running 
anything; you can DMA chunks of memory with the OHCI controller with no 
need for any software support.  The debugger host is what's running 
firescope.
Unless I'm confused too, which is likely.  Andi, I think your docs 
should be more explicit about what runs where.
Also, the tricky bit for me is debugging resume; firescope still 
requires the OHCI device to come up to be useful, but I that's no 
different from using netconsole.
Neat stuff; I need to get my two firewire-enabled machines close enough 
to each other to try it out.
