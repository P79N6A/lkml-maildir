So have a per-CPU (signed) zombie count, and a global zombie count. 
When a process calls exit(), its current CPU increments its own zombie
count; when a process is reaped, the reaping CPU decrements its own
zombie count. Every so often, and whenever someone reads
/proc/nzombies, we pass over all the counts, doing
xchg(&cpu_nzombies[i].val, 0) and adding the returned values to the
global nzombies count.
