I was that other poster.  Typing "is impractical" into your MUA doesn't
make it a fact.  It's not only a very practical solution, it's the
_most_ practical solution.
As other posters have noted, there's no magic incantation to tell you
which IP addresses happen to have an smtpd listening which are the
self-same MTA.  The only person who's going to have this information is
the administrator.
Why are you afraid to ask the mail administrator to do configuration of
the MTA?  Are you afraid they're idiots?
