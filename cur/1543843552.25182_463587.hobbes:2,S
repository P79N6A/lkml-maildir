Care to explain how I can use to implement the equivalent of this:
@@ -1709,6 +1712,7 @@ switch_tasks:
   		++*switch_count;
   		prepare_arch_switch(rq, next);
+		TRACE_SCHEDCHANGE(prev, next);
   		prev = context_switch(rq, prev, next);
   		barrier();
Also, care to explain how kprobes can be used to access same data
without having to actually customize a probe point for every binary?
Thanks,
Karim
