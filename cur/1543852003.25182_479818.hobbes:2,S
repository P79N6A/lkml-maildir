Yes, in particular in large systems.

Interleave is used for data accessed from many nodes otherwise one would 
prefer to allocate from the current zone. The shared data may be very 
frequently accessed from multiple nodes and one would like different NUMA 
nodes to respond to these requests.

No I proposed to go round robin over the remaining nodes. The special case 
of one node left could be dealt with.
