   I won't venture a fix, as I don't know the networking code well
   enough. So far, no networking maintainer has had anything to say
   about this bug on the list...
Because this is the first most of us have heard of the issue, much
less seen any ksymoops processed OOPS logs of the bug so we can even
start thinking about what might be wrong.
Later,
