Hi!
Ok, I am still testing (I compiled about 6 kernels already tonight) but it
appears that dbench numbers start to fall off after 2.3.43.
For a 16 client dbench on my machine (P2/400 (UP!), 256meg IDE):
2.3.42: 16.4meg/sec
2.3.43: 4.2meg/sec
Incidently, 2.3.43 also fails to compile sg.c.  I disabled SCSI for now.
I am compiling figures for kernels from 2.3.41 on and will post them all
in a hour or so.
Lawrence
