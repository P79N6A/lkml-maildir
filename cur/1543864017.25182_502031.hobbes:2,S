Right, this isn't getting merged anywhere near its current state. It
should be implemented as a host driver and we'll modify the mmc core
where needed to cover the differences when doing spi.
As for my "new framework", it's mostly reorganising the stuff already
there. But any patches will have to be reworked after that change. So
I'd suggest holding off on this for a while.

The response type problem is exactly the kind of problem that should be
solved by moving spi support into the mmc core.

I think this is so uncommon and involves so little code that it just
adds complexity to abstract it up to the core. Most hw get interrupts
for insertion/removal.
