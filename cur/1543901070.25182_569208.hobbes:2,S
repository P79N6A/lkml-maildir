It might do, if your i386 is old and has the HPET_ID_LEGSUP bit set.
The code path which that patch disables:
--- a/arch/i386/kernel/hpet.c~x86_64-dynticks-disable-hpet_id_legsup-hpets
+++ a/arch/i386/kernel/hpet.c
@@ -376,7 +376,7 @@ int __init hpet_enable(void)
 
 	clocksource_register(&clocksource_hpet);
 
-	if (id & HPET_ID_LEGSUP) {
+	if (0 && (id & HPET_ID_LEGSUP)) {
 		hpet_enable_int();
 		hpet_reserve_platform_timers(id);
 		/*

will, if executed (on x86_64, at least), instaoops the machine.  It might
take down i386 as well, dunno.
I'd forgotten about this problem, and it seems that Thomas & John have too.
It's a showstopper.
