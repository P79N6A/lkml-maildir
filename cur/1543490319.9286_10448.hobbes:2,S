It would think that it would be more fun to out-compete U.S. based O/S vendors
by providing a fully featured, fully secure system. Once you pull that off,
the export control rules will tumble like the Berlin Wall. (And assuming
there's any U.S. O/S vendors left, breath life back into them).
Focus on the big issue.
