I gave feedback on this before, but didn't get a response.
1) Overload the last futex arg (change from timeval * to void *),
   don't add YA arg at the end.
2) Use __alignof__(u32) not sizeof(u32).  Sure, they're the same, but
   you really mean __alignof__ here.
I'm glad you finally put your name at the top of the file...
Thanks!
Rusty.
