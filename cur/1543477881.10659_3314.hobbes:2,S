Ummm... Typically we need to do some things that may fail after the
emptiness check. Switching the parent for one. So d_move() immediately
after check_empty() doesn't look right. It means one more variable and
there is a plenty of them already. Oh, well... ;-/ BTW, we'll need to
touch dcache.[ch] anyway - I don't see decent d_rehash() around.

	OK, I'll grab pre-8 as soon as it will appear in some place I can
reach (ftp.kernel.org seems to be completely unavailable).
