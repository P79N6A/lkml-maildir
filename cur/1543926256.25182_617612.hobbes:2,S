Sorry for the late reply :\
Yes, the nfsd process only got stuck when I did ls(1) (with or without -l) 
on a NFS share which contained a XFS partition. I did not care for the 
underlying fs first so I just ls'ed my shares and noticed that it got 
stuck. Now that you mention it I tried again, with a (git-wise) current 
2.6 kernel and the same .config: 
http://nerdbynature.de/bits/2.6.24-rc2/nfsd/
Running ls on a ext3 or jfs backed nfs share did succeed, running ls on an 
xfs backed nfs share did not. The sysrq-t (see dmesg.2.gz please) looks 
like yours (to my untrained eye):

Make that "impossible" for me, as I could not boot the bisected kernel and 
marking versions as "bad" for unrelated things seems to invalidate the 
results. However, from ~2500 revisions (2.6.24-rc2 to 2.6.23.1) down to 
~20 or so in just 10 builds, that's pretty awesome.
