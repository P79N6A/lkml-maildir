Quite. Ofcourse, saying "our stacks are 1 page" would be the by far easiest 
solution to that. Personally, I've been running with 4K stacks exclusively 
on a variety of machines for quite some time now, but I can't say I'm all 
too adventurous with respect to filesystems (especially) so I'm not sure how 
many problems remain with 4K stacks. I did recently see Andrew Morton say 
that problems _do_ still exist. If it's just XFS -- well, heck...
Moreover though, rather than 4K, the issue is "single page" stacks meaning a 
larger (soft-) pagesize would seem to fix things nicely. I've been reading 
about that on this list off and on for some time -- no idea where that 
stands though.

This would also need something to tell func() where its current_thread_info 
  is now at. Which might not be much of a problem. Can't think of much else 
either but it's the kind of thing you'd _like_ to be a problem just to have 
an excuse to shoot down an icky notion like that...
Would you intend this just as a "make this path work until we fix it 
properly" kind of thing?
Rene.
