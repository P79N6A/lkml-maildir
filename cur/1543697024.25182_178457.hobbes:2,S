Hi,
Diego suggested sending my bug to this email-adress so maybe some
kernel-developer can tell me what is happening with my computer and if
other people suffer the same problem.
This is what i get : 
Since kernel 2.6.0-test4 my system becomes very slow when using an
smp-kernel.
I have a DELL poweredge 2400 dual PIII 733 Mhz machine with 768 Mb sdram
and some SCSI disks 
I use ext3 for my boot partition and reiserfs for my root partition.
Right now I use kernel 2.6.0-test2 with smp without any problems.
This problem is not X related. Just booting without loading the nvidia
module, logging into the console and shutting down takes more than 10
minutes. With a normal kernel, this would take max. 2 minutes. Most
things become very slow (but other commands like "dmesg >
dmesg.2.6.0-test9" are as fast as always).
The only thing I found different between a normal working kernel and a
buggy kernel are the following lines in my dmesg : 
>> Losing too many ticks!
>> TSC cannot be used as a timesource. (Are you running with SpeedStep?)
>> Falling back to a sane timesource.
I don't have them when running a normal kernel.
I hope somebody can tell me what's going on here.
Thanks.
Zatalian.
