The larger timeslices may not help, but one reason why renicing X hurts
multimedia is that it gives a preference to the GUI over the multimedia
thread(s).
Look at it this way.  Assume renicing X does not _help_ whatever the
problem is (simply because the problem, in this case, is not stemming
from X).  Then giving X the higher priority and larger timeslice only
adversely affects the problem.
So, since the multimedia thread in (say) xmms is really unrelated to X
(its a separate thread and not doing any Xlib calls), it just hurts it.

That is the backboost thing.  It was ripped out, due to regressions in
SETI and elsewhere.
Nick added a similar thing back in, but he just removed it.  Its a shame
it cannot be made to work, because I like the idea.  I talked with Nick
and OLS about the ability of a forward+back boost combination to solve
our interactivity issues.  I really wish they panned out.
