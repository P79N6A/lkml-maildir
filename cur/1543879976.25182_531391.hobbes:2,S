It looks like there are two problems here:
(1) Some notebooks power off and back on when restarting.
    Both Linux and other OS handle that badly because they
    assume power is not interrupted on reboot. The noise
    emitted is relatively loud.
(2) Linux (alone) gives a very muted pop on shutdown. This could
    be from bad interaction with the shutdown command, or some
    other reason (drive not given enough time to shut down?)
    The noise is not very loud, maybe the head did not have to
    move very far?
