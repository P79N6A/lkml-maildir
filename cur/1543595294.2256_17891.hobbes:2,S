I use it as part of a bootloader.  Allowing me to boot one kernel
directly from another.   I guess it really is a soft reboot that never
touches any BIOS.  I don't know if anyone else would get value from it.

Preserving userspace without out any help from user space is quite
a tricky business.  Though with user space help it is fully doable
though it may be a lot of work.
What I have doesn't address perserving user space.  I offered because
I didn't know what was wanted.  An easy kernel upgrade without touching
running processes or a just a fast way to get into a new kernel.
