Hi,
During a hibernate cycle on my G5, while machine was powering down after
saving the image, I just had a NULL dereference  in
clockevents_program_event when accessing dev->mode, dev was NULL.
Unfortunately the machine rebooted before I was able to write down more
than the fact that it was called from tick_program_event(); the problem
doesn't seem to be easily reproducible.
From what I can see when doing the same thing, the shutdown attempts to
offline all CPUs. Because the snapshot was actually saved to disk and
the machine was shutting down I guess that the it happened at that time,
but I have no idea what else to do to debug this.
I have
| CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS=y
| CONFIG_NO_HZ=y
in this config.
