A new cut of my patch available at:
 
http://www.comp.glam.ac.uk/students/djones2/computers/kernel/patches
This one as the filename suggests is against 2.2.3-ac1.
A few new bits, but pretty much the same as 2.2.3-dj1
This patch will /not/ apply cleanly to 2.2.3 vanilla due to the changes in
the NFS code present in Alan Cox's patch.
You can ignore the diff failure if you wish, no real problems will occur.
Differences between Linux 2.2.3-ac1-dj1 and 2.2.3-dj1
o       fs/nfsd/vfs.c
        Optimised some duplicate if conditions.
o       Code to handle f00f bug only compiled in for Pentiums.
o       drivers/char/nvram.c
        - Removed leading space from HD 1 type.
        - Small string optimisation
o       Removed some more unused variables.
o       Fixed up some minor compile warnings.
Things present, that were also in 2.2.3-dj1 :-
o       arch/i386/kernel/apm.c
        Removed two unused vars.
o       arch/sparc64/kernel/cpu.c
        Corrected typo "Unknow CPU"
o       drivers/char/nvram.c
        o Removed leading space from hd0 type.
        o Added recognition for 2.88M 3.5" drive.
o       drivers/net/ne2k-pci.c
        Added support for DLink CT528 (
http://www.dlink.com
)
        This ugly is a clone of a RealTek 8029, which is a clone of an
	NE2k.
        Most bizarre. Even more bizarre, they used almost the same PCI
	info, so adding code to read the subsystem was necessary.
o       drivers/pci/quirks.c
        - Added bridge optimisation for VIA VT82C597AT chipset.
        - Fullstops added to some strings that had them missing.
        I think it's now agreed that this feature will disappear in 2.3.x
	as this really belongs in userland. Until such a program is
	available however, I will continue to maintain this.
	*New*: I've now got a working TunePCI, will release for beta soon.
o       lib/vsprintf.c
        Now prints strings with '%%' in them as '%'.
        Should stop strange texts appearing in /var/log/messages.
regards,
d.
