A very nice, and much needed document. I think you should include one thing though:
memcpy() is _only_ safe when one of the pointers is char* or void*. If it is anything more complex than that, gcc will assume alignment and optimise based on that. E.g. memcpy() of two long:s generates the same assembly as doing an assignment.
(Technically it is no different for char* and void*, but since they have byte alignment, gcc can't really do anything creative.)
