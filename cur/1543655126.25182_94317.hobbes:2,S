yep, those are the two I had in mind when I said they're pending for
2.4.21pre inclusion. He may still suffer other known problems besides
the above two critical highmem fixes (for example if
lower_zone_reserve_ratio is not applied and there's no other fix around
it IMHO, that's generic OS problem not only for linux, and that was my
only sensible solution to fix it, the approch in mainline is way too
weak to make a real difference) though probably whatever else problem
would probably need something more complicated than a tar to reproduce.
