(Long description of how to create a non-executable stack on x86)
I'm afraid you just reinvented the wheel. The idea has been around for a
long time, and it was OK as a quick hack to stop existing exploits
working, but it's possible to modify a buffer overflow exploit to work
around this.
It does sound look like a good idea, but it doesn't really gain you
anything in the long run: the exploits just change a bit.
ISTR there is a patch which does this for Linux, though??
