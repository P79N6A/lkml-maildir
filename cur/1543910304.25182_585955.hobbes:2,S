> The problem is that on x86-64 you are overriding memset() 
I don't.  You must be looking at old source
asm-x86_64/string.h 2.6.23rc3:
#define __HAVE_ARCH_MEMSET
void *memset(void *s, int c, size_t n);
I wanted to do the same on i386 too, but there were some minor obstacles.
The problem is that the out of line fallback i386 memset is currently
quite dumb and needs to be rewritten to expand the fill char on its
own like the x86-64 version. Probably best would be just to port
the x86-64 version. I just hadn't had time for that.
[Patches welcome, but if you do ask me for my old memset test harness]
