Speaking from the HPC standpoint, we are gaining more and more nodes in
clusters as time goes on, so the potential for single failures affecting
performance is growing. A lot of the server class nodes have redundancy
such that the node slows down but not die on failure. Unfortunately,
slowdown in a single node in a tightly coupled job can greatly affect
performance. A good example would be ECC memory. If a chip is going bad,
the machine can detect it but it will run slower until the memory is
replaced. This one node can affect thousands of other nodes in the same
job. Having a mechanism to migrate the operating system that is running
on this failing node to another node would be quite beneficial to
performance. If all drivers properly supported suspend/resume, it could
possibly be extended to support migration to another node as well. At
least for the HPC world, we'd like to see, and encourage, the hardware
you describe getting full support for suspend/resume.
