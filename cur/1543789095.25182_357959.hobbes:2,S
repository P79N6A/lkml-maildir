HRT (in all its versions) requires the availability of a hardware timer to provide an interrupt at 
timer expiry.  I am not sure how this is done in UML but my guess is that the host kernel would need 
to have HRT running on it.  Then the UML kernel(s) would transform the HRT requests into the proper 
user call to the host.

There are several 2.4 HRT patches on the HRT site, see signature below.
Still, these patches do not provide kernel access to the high-res timers.  This has been done in one 
case, but the interface is not really defined nor stable (i.e. we may change it in the next 
release...).  Look for HIGH_RES_TIMERS in the ipmi driver in the 2.6 kernel tree to see how to go 
about this.
