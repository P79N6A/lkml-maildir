Just a random idea that occurred to me...
Since the El-Torito bootable CD standard supports multiple floppy
images on a single CD, it would be possible to write a script that
takes a .config file, and the source to, say all the -pre and -rc
versions of a particular kernel, compiles multiple kernels with the
same .config, and writes a CD with them all on, set to boot from an
arbitrary disk partition.
It would make:
> > > Foo doesn't work in -rc2
> > Did it work in -rc1
> Not sure
E-Mail exchanges a thing of the past.
Note, that as each floppy image is separate, it's not the same as
trying to cram multiple kernels on a 2.88 MB floppy image, and is
therefore actually do-able :-).
John.
