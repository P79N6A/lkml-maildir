Theory F:  It broke because you are using NetworkManager for your
network devices and the patches that fix this have not made it into a
real release?
I'm just guessing, but does anyone who is having this problem, NOT using
NetworkManager?
I'm running an old version of HAL just fine, but I'm not using
NetworkManager here.
I am using NetworkManager on a OpenSuSE 10.3 release, but suse's version
of NetworkManager is well known to not be anywhere near what is released
as a tarball :(
