I wish it would be just renaming :-)

| I would suggest using sizeof(long) alignment for data.
Maybe we could use more flexible scheme? Lets imagine we could
need to use not sizeof(long) on x86-64 for example... say in
boot/compressed/head_64.S... say for boot_heap. Should we use
DATAENTRY here? Or it's planned to use DATAENTRY for global defs
only? Alexander, don't get me wrong I'm just starting to confuse
with ENRTY/PROC/DATAENTRY :)
Letme try to classify them a bit (like they would be used in future).
If we have them classified it would be easier to distinguish their
usage and how they should be implemented
- PROC/ENDPROC for "C" callers
	- they are: aligned, .global, .size and .type and @function
- DATA/ENDDATA for data objects
	- they are: aligned as sizeof(long), .global, .size
right?
