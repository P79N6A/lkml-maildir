  Hi,
  the problem actually isn't in quota but in VFS layer (you'd get same
result if you just run out of empty space on disk).  I actually also
looked into fixing this but it showed up to require rewriting of code on
a lot of places and so I postponed the problem because I find the
problem more or less cosmetic... Or do you have some application failing
on this?
