Sorry, I'm having trouble expressing myself clearly today ;-)
I didn't mean to suggest that the interpretation of the numbers or the
gpio_request() implementation should be arch-independent. I was merely
suggesting that the _concept_ of requesting GPIO pins before using
them, keeping track of which pins have been allocated before, isn't
something inherently arch-specific.
I'm all for leaving it up to each arch or possibly each sub-arch how
to implement the request/free functions. They can even be implemented
as no-op stubs that always succeed for all I care. But I don't think
any arch or platform will really have much trouble with implementing
some kind of "please reserve this gpio pin represented as an unsigned
int for me" call.

Agreed. The avr32 implementation also uses a per-controller bitmap and
supports any number of instances (up to a compile-time limit since it
is initialized too early to be able to allocate any memory.) It
doesn't support different type of controllers though; that would
require some kind of demuxing and should probably be avoided on
platforms that don't need it.
