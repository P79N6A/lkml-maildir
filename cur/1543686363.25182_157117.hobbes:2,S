For what problem?  In the example above, 5 is correct return value.
7.19.6.5  The snprintf function
Synopsis
#include <stdio.h>
int snprintf(char * restrict s, size_t n, const char * restrict format, ...);
Description
The snprintf function is equivalent to fprintf, except that the output is
written into an array (specified by argument s) rather than to a stream.
If n is zero, nothing is written, and s may be a null pointer.  Otherwise,
output characters beyond the n-1st are discarded rather than being written
to the array, and a null character is written at the end of the characters
actually written into the array.  If copying takes place between objects
that overlap, the behavior is undefined.
Returns
The snprintf function returns the number of characters that would have
been written had n been sufficiently large, not counting the terminating
null character, or a negative value if an encoding error occurred.  Thus,
the null-terminated output has been completely written if and only if
the returned value is nonnegative and less than n.
