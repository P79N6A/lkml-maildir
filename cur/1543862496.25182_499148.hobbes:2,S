BTW, for a solution to be complete, we need to halt all work on all 
other ports, when issuing SET FEATURES - XFER MODE.  On SiI and Promise 
controllers, possibly others, the command is snooped and side effects 
such as register setting occur.
Long standing to-do.  Currently we hack around this by serializing the 
bus probe, and preventing people from issuing SET FEATURES - XFER MODE 
from userspace.
