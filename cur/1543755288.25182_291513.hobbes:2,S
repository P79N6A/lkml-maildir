If the page is modified by a DMA transfer or by the CPU via the kernel's
page mappings then there is no record of its having been altered.  Which is
why we must do it in software.

If you don't have a reference on the page's inode, yes, you should use
set_page_dirty_lock().  If the page came from get_user_pages() then surely
you don't have a ref on the inode.
