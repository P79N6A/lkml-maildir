Hi!
I've just tried to run 2.2.2 on my (new) AMD K6. Whatever I
do (with/without extended RTC-support, whatever Processor-type),
I always get the message 
"bug: kernel timer added twice at c01bbbb4" or "at c01be5f", etc,
depending on what other options I've set. The message appears
after all SCSI & IDE-Drives have been detected and *before*
e2fsck checks them. 
Is that a known bug of the new kernel, or a bug of the CPU, 
any known workarounds? A precompiled 2.0.36 works fine with
the CPU (but it was compiled for 80386, lacks TV & Sound-
support :(
If you want, I can send you .config or even the image. And please
cc anything you're discussing about this -- I'm not on the list :)
thanks
Christian
