Hi!
Vojtech asked me how fast swsusp actually is... So I did some timings
for your pleasure...
It *very* much depends on load. I have fairly minimal system with X
and rhytmbox as a test load.
Boot:	16 sec			(From enter in grub to login)  
Suspend:	13 sec, 13 sec
Resume:		27 sec, 20 sec	(From enter in grub to bash# prompt)
So yes, even on my machines boot is faster then resume, OTOH it takes
me quite long to login, relaunch X etc.
Oh and yes, I have pretty fast boot ;-) [system is centrino 1.4
notebook].
If your system is way slower than this, and you know how to make it
slow, tell me. (But I'm looking for a script to fill memory or
something, saying "just boot mandrake 17.9 and login into kde 15.3" is
not going to help).
