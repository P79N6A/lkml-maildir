That was my assumption as well, but was hoping someone could decode the 
above information and point me to the problem chip.  I ran Memtest86 
overnight but found no problems, but don't know if it needs to run in a 
particular ECC mode.
This is a dual proc 275 system with 4 1GB DIMMs.  Guessing that MC1 is 
the controller on the second CPU.  Would row 1 be the second DIMM?
