why should you call any method, the ->read_super just make sure if it
fails you can safely get rid of the logical struct inode. I don't see
any problem in solving this case without special iput cases.

			sop->write_super(sb);

			sop->put_super(sb);

	if (invalidate_inodes(sb)) {

If put_user changes an inode and then it does an iput internally, it's
its own business to recall fsync_dev internally if necessary. btw, we could
even move all the invalidate code into the lowlevel callbacks, the point
of having it at the VFS is because most fs are just fine with it, but it
doesn't restrict any functionality.
