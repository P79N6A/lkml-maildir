Hi,
Strange. I have run the code both from NFS mounted and ext2 partitions
and never saw such a message. I'm running RH6.2 with 2.2.16 kernel
(with knfsd.) The NFS disks are hard mounted and used to complain
about nfs server not responding, but since the switch upgrade that
message disappeared from the syslog. What's your configuration?

   Hi,
   on our ES40 2.2.14, NFS mounted directory I get in syslog:
   /.nfs0000000021364c6b0000000f, error=-13
   NFS: can't silly-delete mqueue/.nfs0000000021358c8700000015, error=-13
   NFS: can't silly-delete tmp/.nfs0000000021364c6f0000001a, error=-13
   NFS: can't silly-delete tmp/.nfs0000000021364c710000001c, error=-13

   NFS: can't silly-delete mqueue/.nfs0000000021358c8c0000002b, error=-13
   The test4_out.1 file says:
   The e-mail address is frey
   The hostname of this machine is es0.scs.ch
   The architecture of this machine is ALPHA
   The process id is 873
   The executable is szin_w-11-2.ALPHA
   The reader is read-szin-11-15
   Time = map_shmem: error in shmget: Invalid argument
   test4_a : Error in szin_w-11-2.ALPHA : program crashed, status=1
   Exaclty the same (including the kernel messages) comes when
   running on a local SCSI disk with ext2 filesystem. What's
   wrong?
