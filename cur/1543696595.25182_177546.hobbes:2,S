And it's working, I would not have purchased a SATA150 TX4 for my new 
server if libata did not have support for it. I know, it's small 
potatoes, they didn't make much money off that sale, but everything 
helps. The only other 4-port (non RAID) SATA card I have seen was from 
SIIG, but it has disappeared from their web site and distributors, and 
libata's support for the Sil3114 on it isn't ready yet anyway :-)
