Once input core was converted to sysfs the bereakage was unavoidable.
Because of historical oversight input_dev and input interfaces, such
as mouseX were generating the same "input" events with different
arguments. The option was either to go with separate classes
(breakage) or making hierarchy within one class (breakage again). And
sysfs conversion was needed to do hotplug over netlink...

I would say that udev and hotplug is special kind of userspace as it
really extension of the kernel. It would probably be best if udev was
packaged together with the kernel.
