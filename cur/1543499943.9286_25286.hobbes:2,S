Ingo,
I'll look at 2.2 and compare it.  Right now I'm working on a code drop for
today.  I apologize if I cannot jump right on this for you, but I am trying
to get some stuff Alan Cox asked me to check in finished.  As soon as this
is finished then I'll go through the code.  Which files is this in in 2.2?
Thanks
Jeff
