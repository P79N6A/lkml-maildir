Yes, this is what I have concluded from this thread. Trying to guess which 
tasks should have higher priority is not the right approach. It's not a CPU 
scheduler's business to decide about priorities.

Yes, this seems to be the right approach from all the opinions I've heard.

I'm sure they'll do once a fair scheduler goes into mainline :)
I guess what I was missing from the beginning is that "fair" means that the 
scheduler will be fair among tasks that have the same priority, but if a task 
has a higher priority, it _will_ get more CPU. So we'll just have to mark 
applications like video players, audio players or games with a high priority, 
others like encoders or compilers with low priority, and leave the rest 
(browsers, word processors, email readers, etc...) as normal priority. This 
way a fair scheduler would be able to give each task right amount of CPU.
That sounds like a good solution to me.
Thanks,
Alberto.
