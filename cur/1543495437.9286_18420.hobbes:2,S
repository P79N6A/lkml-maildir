> So why would it report 33483/16/63 then. (Award BIOS)
Name the disk type, the hdparm -I output, the Award BIOS version,
whether you have the disk in the setup as None/Normal/Large/LBA/Auto,
whether you also have SCSI disks.
But why?
I quoted an ATA-5 draft standard.
This disk probably does not comply with that standard.
If the actual size is 33483*16*63 then that is fine.
The Linux kernel source just has to learn that 16383*H*S may be
unrelated to the actual size of the disk.
But there are other possibilities. The Linux kernel sometimes
confuses SCSI disk parameters and IDE disk parameters,
so that the above may be a geometry that belongs to a SCSI disk.
Really, the Linux kernel is full of minor bugs in this geometry area
(and correspondingly, lots of people have problems at install time).
There is no reason at all to suspect buggy disks and BIOSes
(although these exist, of course).
