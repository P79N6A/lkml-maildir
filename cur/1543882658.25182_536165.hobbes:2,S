Ben,
OK. Attached is a gziped tar file named patch.tar.gz containing the
following:
patch - The patch file, hopefully ungarbled.
ibm_emac_phy.c - The modified source file, in case the patch file is
still wrong.
log.txt - A log of what I did to create the patch, in case I bungled
that too.
Note I created the patch using the instructions in
Documentation/SubmittingPatches.
Let me know if this gets thru ok. If not, I can try Morse Code.
