Can we try to get the whole design right from the start?

It is only a bug because you hadn't plugged the hole -- make it fix up pte_file
ones as well.

Yes, and it would be ridiculous to do this with non linear protections anyway.
If the vma code is so slow that glibc wants to merge code and data vmas together,
then we obviously need to fix the data structure (which will help everyone)
rather than hacking around it.

I see no reason why they couldn't both go in. In fact, having an mmap flag for
adding guard regions around vmas (and perhaps eg. a system-wide / per-process
option for stack) could almost go in tomorrow.
