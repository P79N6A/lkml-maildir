	You might be better off asking this up on one of the Samba
mailing lists.  We have options in Samba for simultaniously changing
both the Windows NT password hashes and the Unix hashes where Samba
is providing NT encrypted password authentication.  You can also use
pam_smb to use the NT password hashes for Unix password validation as
well.  In either case, it's more a generic Unix thing than it is a
specific Linux thing and you're more like to find your answers in the
Samba project.  Try samba@samba.org, samba-techincal@samba.org, or
samba-ntdom@samba.org.
