That works, but see 
http://bugs.debian.org/64958
 for my variant: a
fairly trivial diff diff that adds a flag '-k' which lets you specify
your backup suffix, then it just takes one file|dir instead of two.
  diff -urN -Xdontdiff -k.orig {source-tree}
It's been sent to Paul Eggert (of diffutils); no word so far.

No it doesn't, not always.  Your choice:
  (setq make-backup-files nil)
  (setq backup-by-copying t)
