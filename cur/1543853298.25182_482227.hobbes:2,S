There are two things that can be happening when OS does not see HPET in
ACPI.
- BIOS did enable HPET in chipset and did not communicate it to OS.
- BIOS did nothing to enable HPET in chipset.
The quirk below tries to find the HPET base address in case 1. But in
case 2 this will also fail as HPTC will be 0 below (Probably we can
still assume default base address of 0xFED00000 and probe there. But I
am still checking on that). I just added couple of chipset ids that I
could test on...
On the systems that I tested, HPTC was zero (case 2 above) and patch
below did not really help.
I am building on this patch to enable HPET in late init stage based on
the the quirk information. Will be interesting to see what this patch
says on other ICH based systems that don't have HPET info in ACPI.
Thanks,
Venki
--------------
PCI quirk to force enable HPET, even when BIOS does not report it
to OS in traditional ACPI table way.
Only handles few PCI_IDS at the moment. If we need it for wider use, we
should add all ICH7, ICH8, ICH9 (may be ICH6 as well) IDs.
