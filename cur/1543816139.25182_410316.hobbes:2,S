Hi.
Current git produces the following compile error (x86_64 uniprocessor compile):
arch/x86_64/pci/mmconfig.c:152: error: conflicting types for ‘pci_mmcfg_init’
arch/i386/pci/pci.h:85: error: previous declaration of ‘pci_mmcfg_init’ was here
make[1]: *** [arch/x86_64/pci/mmconfig.o] Error 1
make: *** [arch/x86_64/pci] Error 2
I haven't found out yet how the i386 file is getting included, but I
can say that git compiled fine last night.
Greg, I believe you're the pci guru, so I thought I'd try you too.
Apologies in advance if I've gotten it wrong.
Regards,
Nigel
