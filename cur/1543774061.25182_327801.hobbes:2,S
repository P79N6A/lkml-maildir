I'm not clear on how the value of ->time_slice can ever grow to larger than 
task_timeslice(p). It starts at task_timeslice(p) and decrements till it gets 
to 0 when it refills again. 
I only recall three times that the value of p->time_slice is increased:
New timeslice where it is refilled with task_timeslice(p)
At fork() where if it has one tick left it is increased back to one tick
Reaping a child where it collects its child's time_slice up to a maximum of 
task_timeslice(p).
I must be missing something but I can't see how p->time_slice can ever be 
larger than task_timeslice(p).
Please correct me :|
