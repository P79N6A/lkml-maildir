In fs/sysfs/group.c:
void sysfs_remove_group(struct kobject * kobj,
                        const struct attribute_group * grp)
{
        struct dentry * dir;
        if (grp->name)
                dir = lookup_one_len(grp->name, kobj->dentry,
                                strlen(grp->name));
        else
                dir = dget(kobj->dentry);
        remove_files(dir,grp);
        if (grp->name)
                sysfs_remove_subdir(dir);
        /* release the ref. taken in this routine */
        dput(dir);
}
'dir' is being used without checking whether lookup_one_len()
succeeded.

Sometimes notebooks have USB devices built-in and they get treated
as if they were hotplugged.
