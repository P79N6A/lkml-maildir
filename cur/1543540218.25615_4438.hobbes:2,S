Now, the maximum number of groups is something that the kernel could
potentially change and that *would* affect user space.  Similar to the
maximum number of files.  Now... we have a perfectly good way to export
constants like that to user space, i.e. the sysctl (/proc/sys)
mechanism.  This gives a couple of options:
a) The kernel implements such a sysctl, readonly at least for now, glibc
uses it, if available;
b) glibc doesn't do anything for now, if we change NGROUPS we export it
via sysctl and glibc will need to be updated then;
c) we reserve a namespace point, say /proc/sys/kernel/ngroups, and glibc
uses it, if available.  If we ever change NGROUPS *then* we add it to
the kernel;
d) glibc may have a /etc/sysconf file, which can look like:
	__SC_NGROUPS	32
   ... in the future, it may look like ...
	__SC_NGROUPS	/proc/sys/kernel/ngroups
	-hpa
