Well, we have kexec. We already have way for kernel to relocate itself.

Yes, the idea is "interesting". I do not think it quite cuts
"misguided" part.
memtest has following problems:
	0) it is kind of hard to run memtest over ssh
	1) if linux fixes some problem with PCI quirk or microcode
	upload, memtest will not see the fix
	2) if memory only fails while something else happens (DMA to
	other piece of memory? Hard disk load glitching powre
	supply?), memtest will not see the problem.
(Of course, memtest-under-linux has some problems too. Like "if it
freezes, was it bad memory or kernel problem").
