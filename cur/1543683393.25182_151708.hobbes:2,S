Or you can have devfs mounted in another place (like /dev2) and create a script which creates symlinks from /dev2 to /dev with your own preferred names, and you can edit /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit to run the script on bootup.

ah! This should be placed somewhere in a FAQ or so. As I've read through
the docs this isn't mentioned anywhere. This of course solves all my
concerns about devfs. Will try it again soon.
Thanks for enlightment :-)
