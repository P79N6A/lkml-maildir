It was a little odd to see this patch get submitted and accepted in the 
middle of the 'patch penguin' thread.  IMHO, this illustrates perfectly why
we need a standard place to submit patches.  There is a patchbot under
construction, which I hope will address this kind of problem without
introducing new ones.  We shall see if it really does when it's opened up for 
testing, EA about one month.
The idea is that we'll create a patch submission address for the patchbot 
itself, and see what it feels like submitting patchbot patches that way.  For 
anyone interest, the project page is here:
  
http://killeri.net/patchbot.html
with links there already somewhat out of date, please see the mailing list 
archive.
My main problem with the EA interface patch itself is that there is no
way to specify the class of the EA, currenly 'system' or 'user'.
Instead, individual filesystems are expected to parse the attribute
name to determine the class.  I think this is inadequate, and has not
been discussed sufficiently.
What will happen is, user space utilities will start making assumptions
about the syntax of ea names (because the kernel interface provides no
other alternative) and the current, arbitrary, EA name syntax will become 
cast in stone for ever more.  Then attribute classes will start to multiply, 
we'll get attribute namespaces, and we'll get more arbitrary hacks added to 
the attribute name syntax to accomodate them.  Support for 'new, improved' 
attribute name syntax will be variable across filesystems.  This isn't going 
to be pretty.
