I have done some changes to the via-rhine driver in 2.4.13 to be able to run
with MMIO. I know it isn't really needed but I do it mainly for fun &
learning.
The most important change was to enable memory-mapped mode within the rhine
chip by a standard port-io call. I have got it all to work, and it works
under stress test too, but there is a section in the code that I wonder
about:
(drivers/net/via-rhine.c)
...
/* Reload the station address from the EEPROM. */
writeb(0x20, ioaddr + MACRegEEcsr);
/* Typically 2 cycles to reload. */
for (i = 0; i < 150; i++)
    if (! (readb(ioaddr + MACRegEEcsr) & 0x20))
        break;
...
If I run this code when I'm using MMIO, I get a hardware adress of
"ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff" instead of the right one (and everything craps up). But
when I comment out this part all is fine. So what's it needed for anyway?
