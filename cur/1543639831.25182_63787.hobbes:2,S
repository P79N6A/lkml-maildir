   This almost certainly breaks on sparc, where CPU cross-calls are 
   non-maskable, so local_irq_disable doesn't do anything for them.
   
   Talk to Davem about this - there may be some workaround.
I told him it's OK in 2.5.x as I've discovered a way to implement
sparc32 (once we have it working again) such that local_irq_disable
blocks cross calls.
