By console I suppose you mean "printk output", because that's the only 
thing I can decipher from the 'redirecting stuff' in the TIOCCONS function. 
(Reminds me of klogconsole which is some sort of redirector.)
There is one slight problem with tioccons: if kernel output was redirected 
to, say, /dev/pts/1 (some graphical app) and then /dev/pts/1 disappears, 
who is going to set the tioccons back? And to what value?
That's why there is "xconsole", which does read the entire syslog and not 
just console/printk messages.
