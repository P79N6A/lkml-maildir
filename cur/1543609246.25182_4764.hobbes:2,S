... and machine is dead - poweroff button does not work. I always thought
that it is specific to VIA chipsets, as almost same configuration (PII
instead of PIII) worked fine on GA-6BXDS (i440BX), and it is new to me
that AMD has same troubles. Help is simple - do not use VIA chipsets,
at least I did not found any other way how to get it to work
(except disabling mainmemory,PCI->AGP transfers (CPU->AGP are OK, 
obviously...)).

P.S.: If you have dualhead G400 on VIA and two bt848 grabbers, just run
one fbtv -k on first head, and another fbtv -k on second head. It will
die as soon as you hit enter on second fbtv (and of course they must be
in <=16bpp, as 694X does not handle even one memory stream needed for 
32bpp full PAL PCI->AGP transfer).
