Hi!
acpi/event.c needs some heavy facelifting.
This one is needed so that return value (ERESTARTSYS) is propagated
from bus_receive_event(). If this is not done, suspend/resume causes
cat /proc/acpi/event to fail with -EIO. Please apply.
However, there are more problems with event.c:
* it uses spinlock_irq to protect event_is_open(). That's huge
overkill, atomic_t should be enough here, and it is never accessed
from interrupt anyway.
* its racy w.r.t. concurent readers (and yes, you *can* have concurent
readers, think threads). acpi_system_read_event() uses static
variables, without any locking. Probably seq_printf() converstion is
needed.
