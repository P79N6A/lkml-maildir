There are still a few areas that need work, ioctl gives me problems, but
the latest 2.6 kernels are quite good.  If you look at the 'clean'
version of the voluntary kernel preemption patch it is pretty small.  My
understanding is that the kernel is already preemptible anytime that a
spin lock (including the BKL) is not held, and that the voluntary kernel
preemption patch adds some scheduling points in places where it is safe
to sleep, but preemption is disabled because we are holding the BKL, and
that the number of these should approach zero as the kernel is improved
anyway.

Yes, this is important.  One problem I had recently with the Via EPIA
board was that unless 2D acceleration was disabled by setting 'Option
"NoAccel"' in /etc/X11/XF86Config-4, overloading the X server would
cause interrupts from the soundcard to be completely disabled for tens
of milliseconds.  Users should keep in mind that by using 2D or 3D
hardware acceleration in X, you are allowing the X server to directly
access hardware, which can have very bad results if the driver is
buggy.  I am not sure the kernel can do anything about this.
