I have a hpt370 based controller which shares an irq with a broadcom
bcm4401 network adaptor.
when transferring stuff over the network the ide controller drops the
dma for all disks on the controller repeatedly... so it is not a
cable/disk problem but a problem in the nic's driver/the hpt driver.
however this stuff only happens when I put high load on the nic. the
drives form a software raid and reconstructing it does not cause any
trouble...
here is my setup:
7:   28328328          XT-PIC  ide4, ide5, eth0
hdi: 4 bytes in FIFO
hdi: timeout waiting for DMA
hdi: (__ide_dma_test_irq) called while not waiting
hdi: dma_intr: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hdk: dma_intr: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hdk: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hdk: DMA disabled
hdk: drive not ready for command
ide4: reset: success
ide5: reset: success
Thanks,
Soeren.
