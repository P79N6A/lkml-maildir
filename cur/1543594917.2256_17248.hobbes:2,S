Hi,
My collegue has a Lifetec 9888 laptop (PII) that suffers from IRQ
deadlocking :
His TI PCMCIA bridge locates itself on IRQ 12, and so does his mouse.
System boots fine, but as soon as he types anything or moves his mouse,
the keyboard locks.
2.2.x doesn't seem to allocate a IRQ to the bridge, so no problems there.
Remote access is still possible, and the system works fine excepts that
his keyboard / mouse are dead :)
Not starting GPM prevents the lock.
Is there any way to tell the PCI subsystem to leave IRQ 12 alone ? The
pci_setup() routine seems to be a pretty noop.
	Regards,
		Igmar Palsenberg
