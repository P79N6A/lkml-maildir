To dissapate the heat apparently generated by the current byteorder
thread I thought I'd mention the email I found waitng when I went to
work this morning.  Our system administrators submitted a request for
downtime on one of the network data servers.  This network runs Solaris
2.5.1 on a variety of Sun boxes.  Anyway, the request was for an hour of
downtime to shut down and reboot the server.  The reason given for the
request was because the server had an uptime of 100 days and Sun
recommends rebooting the machine at least every 30 days to clear up dead
processes in the process list and ensure no memory management problems
cropped up.
I emailed back a suggestion to convert the system to Linux, which
doesn't have a problem with long uptimes.  Needless to say, they were
NOT amused.
