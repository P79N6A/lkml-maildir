It returns after all of the bookeeping for creating the thread is done: 
setting up the stack, thread context structure and calling clone(). As the
last step, the manager wakes up the pthread_create() requestor.

That suggests that the scheduler is slow in getting this thread up and running;
probably because you have swamped it with lots of other threads that are
chewing up significant portions of their time quanta.

Even if you make it a high priority thread, it does not start that way; it
becomes high priority after it executes the code which performs the adjustment.
So you can't expect a newly created high priority thread to immediately take
over as soon as it is presented to the scheduler.
If you want a thread to ``spin up'' fast in response to something, you should
have a live thread that is ready to go, and can be unblocked rapidly with a
simple pthread_cond_broadcast, sem_post or equivalent. Such a thread will
already have the desired priority, and its kernel resources already allocated.
So at worst it will suffer some page faults if its stack or other working
data has been swapped out.
