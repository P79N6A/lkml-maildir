Nope. Still the same error after that one is set :
CONFIG_IP_ADVANCED_ROUTER=y
[root@base root]# ip rule list
RTNETLINK answers: Invalid argument
Dump terminated
According to net/ipv4/Config.in :
if [ "$CONFIG_IP_ADVANCED_ROUTER" = "y" ]; then
   define_bool CONFIG_RTNETLINK y
   define_bool CONFIG_NETLINK y
CONFIG_IP_ADVANCED_ROUTER just sets those two values, and adapts the
questions. To make sure I just recompiled with Advanced Router turned on,
and still the same error.
I tested the other command of the ip command, and this one is the only one
that gives problems, the others are fine.
