A few notes. Please, could you leave the raw proc interface for ISA PnP?
I mean isapnp_proc_bus_read() function. Also, encoding device/vendor to 
7-byte string seems like wasting bytes and CPU cycles. If you use 2/2 byte 
format, you'll spare 3 bytes and comparing of two short values (or one 
int value) is always less expensive.
Anyway, I like this code. It seems that you don't use standard pci_dev / 
pci_bus structures as I was forced by Linus at ISA PnP code inclusion 
time. But it's true that we have new device model, so these things might 
be private. Also, don't forget to remove additional ISA PnP members from 
pci structures when Linus approves pnp_dev and pnp_card structures.
