   2. What happens if I open and try to read from this port while something
      has the serport_ldisc attached?  I suspect that you'll create nice
      loop of serio devices in serio.c and an infinite loop when you try to
      traverse the list to remove a different serio device.
SERIO devices are not meant to be registered as normal TTYs.
At least I don't do this for any of the Sparc serial ports
when they are the keyboard/mouse serio device.
