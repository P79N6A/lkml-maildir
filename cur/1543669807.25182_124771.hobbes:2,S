Is the basic assumption that lower block numbers are generally located
in zones nearer the outside of the disk still true, though?  I.E. do
you know of any disks that 'start from the middle'?  I usually
recommend that people place their swap and /var partitions near the
beginning of the disk, (for a _slight_ improvement), but maybe there
is a good reason not to do this for some disks?
