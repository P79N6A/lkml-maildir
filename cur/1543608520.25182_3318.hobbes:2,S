All the XML parser interfaces that I have seen so far allow you to do things 
that will cause the code to fail when you do stupid things or are not 
prepared that there may appear unknown elements. Or you use a DTD, and then 
your code is guaranteed to fail after a change, which may be even worse.
One-value-files are a noticable exception, you must be VERY stupid if your 
code breaks because of an additional file.
