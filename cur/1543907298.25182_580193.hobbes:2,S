Thanks! It's a good news after all - it would be really strange why
this place doesn't hit more people (it seems there is some safety
elsewhere for this).
BTW: I hope, this previous Thomas' patch with Ingo's warning to resend.c
(with a warning), had no problems with a similar load?
So, once more, I would suspect hw retrigger code. Ingo, IMHO, this
patch for testing HARDIRQS_SW_RESEND could be reworked, so that
desc->chip->retrigger() is done only for eadges and the tasklet only
for levels. BTW, I think this current warning in the "temporary" is
is too early - we don't know if after this the ->retrigger() will
take place.
Regards,
Jarek P.
PS: Marcin, if you need a break in this testing let us know!
I think the main idea of this bug is known enough.
