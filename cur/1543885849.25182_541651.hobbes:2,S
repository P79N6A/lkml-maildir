WTF. It certainly does explain what it's all about (hint: hit '?') and
you've clearly failed to read it, even while creating the patch.

NAK. Let's actually read that config option description:
menuconfig EMBEDDED
        bool "Configure standard kernel features (for small systems)"
        help
          This option allows certain base kernel options and settings
          to be disabled or tweaked. This is for specialized
          environments which can tolerate a "non-standard" kernel.
          Only use this if you really know what you are doing.
That means this option is for specialized environments which can
tolerate a non-standard kernel and people should only use it if they
really know what they're doing.
Think about what non-standard means. We absolutely don't want to hear
from anyone whose machine silently crashed only to discover they
accidentally had CONFIG_PRINTK off. None of the options in that menu
are of any interest to the average user and they shouldn't be using
them.
Feel free to suggest better help text if that isn't clear enough.
