Hmm...  I believe there's a misunderstanding on the term `static' here.
Linus uses `static' to describe the partitioning of space between the
various subsystems: eg plain (direct) PCI, ISA, PCMCIA &c.  He says the
logical resource structure should still be partitioned according to these.
He also says these resources should be allocated on driver initialization
time (and not on device open or equivalent).  I believe he's right.
David is using `static' mostly in the context of its relation to physical
hardware.  As such, of course the resources are split by subsystem / bus /
whatever, but they are _different_.
So I still stand by my previous analysis: we need two trees (or actually
sets of trees)--- one is for logical resources (ioport / iomem / physmem /
virtmem / ...); the other is for physical properties of the system.  The
logical trees are what's generally used by drivers; the physical ones are
mostly of interest to the various bus drivers, PnP subsystem, and hotplug
support code.

You're arguing my point.  Just in different words.
To reiterate: the trees are _not_ describing the same resource.  Not at
all.  The existing trees describe resource allocations to drivers; the new
ones describe the resources provided by specific hardware (albeit in a
crooked fashion, where the resources are the index).
