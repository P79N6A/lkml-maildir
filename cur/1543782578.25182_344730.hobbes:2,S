The kernel already includes gunzip for itself, so it just needs an
unarchiver (tar or cpio) which should just add a few Kb.
Every self-extracting executable would require the builtin code
to extract itself.
The kernel code to recognize and execute the self-extracting code,
would probably be the same size as an unarchiver (tar or cpio).
