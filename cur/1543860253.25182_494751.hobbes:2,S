Yes, that's what I also did. And then I checked for all interfaces in all 
headers included indirectly through sched.h and not already included in 
the respective source file to see whether any of these includes are needed 
to keep the file compilable (although this time, amazingly few includes 
had to be added back - only 5 for all 556)
Maybe I should have taken a look at my original patch descripions from 
last year, I admit the current one isn't very illuminating.
