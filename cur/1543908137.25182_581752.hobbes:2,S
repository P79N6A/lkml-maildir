Well, if you want to clean up your patch queue a bit then I have a few
suggestions for some patches of mine that are currently in -mm that
you could push to Linus.  They are not really important, so if you'd
rather keep them around in -mm until the next merge window then that's
fine by me, but they should be safe to push and would get cut down on
the number of patches you track a bit :-)
This fix was already merged for the ati side of things, this is an
identical fix for the amd side of things - I see no reason why we
shouldn't get this fix into 2.6.23 as well :
 fix-use-after-free--double-free-bug-in-amd_create_gatt_pages--amd_free_gatt_pages.patch
This patch only changes the output of the script when run without
arguments, so as far as building the kernel goes it can't cause any
regressions and it's a clear improvement over what we currently have,
so might as well get it out of your queue and upstream :
 improve-scripts-gcc-versionsh-output-a-bit-when-called-without-args.patch
When people use scripts/ver_linux in bugreports we want correct info -
currently we often print wrong info for the binutils version. This
patch doesn't hurt existing working scenarios but does fix a few
broken ones, might as well get that merged, it's a clear fix :
 scripts-ver_linux-correct-printing-of-binutils-version.patch
These should all be trivially correct since they just remove duplicate
#include's of the same header into a .c file outside any #ifdef and
similar magic, so they should be quite safe to push. Also, I haven't
seen anything but ACK's in response to them (when I've seen a
response), and a few of my similar patches have already been merged :
