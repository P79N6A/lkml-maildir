OK, this works. The Visor now hotsyncs and I get no hangs or freezes.
Thanks. I am still willing to help track down the problem if you have
any other diagnostic suggestions.
So is there a downside to uhci compared to usb-uhci? Would moving to
kernel 2.6 likely fix the problem? Finally, what is the "right way" to
get my redhat system to permanently use uhci?
