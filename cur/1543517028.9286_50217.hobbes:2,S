All reads/writes happen in program order with respect to the observed
memory image.
If anything changes to the inputs of a speculatively executed instruction
prior to becoming committed state, then that work is thrown out.  There is
no causality violation.
In specific, since "lock" and "shared" observed in order, and since
IA32 executes in program order with respect to the observed memory image,
then when the change to "lock" is observed for the "bts lock", the
change to "shared" MUST be.

I believe LOCK# doesn't serialize memory accesses, it just prevents other
bus readers/writers from getting access to that location for the duration
of the operation in question.
It also doesn't need to, since the program is executed are done AS IF in
order with respect to the observed memory image.
