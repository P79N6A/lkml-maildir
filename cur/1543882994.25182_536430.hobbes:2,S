Yep, it's strange because I can't reproduce this. And the console write

is done by X (unless your version is different).

I don't.  But, what is your current console?  Is it VGA, or framebuffer?
Can you try doing this again in both VGA and vesafb?
And this does not happen if there is no previous setterm -blank 0
command?
