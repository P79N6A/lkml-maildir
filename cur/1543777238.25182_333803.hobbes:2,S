Subject: [PATCH 3/3] fix page-becoming-writable in do_file_page
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/7/13/154

The get_user_pages force write case (from ptrace) expects that a single
call to handle_mm_fault is enough to give it a page it can safely write
to.  This implies that when handling a write access to a page_mkwrite
area, do_file_page must now itself call do_wp_page to call page_mkwrite
and (probably) make the pte writable: that cannot safely be left to a
subsequent fault.
Clarify today's flow of control in do_file_page: it is only called for a
pte_file entry, which only appears in a non-linear vma, which is always
shared and must have a populate: so the do_no_page path is never taken.
