Actually, some data structures could well shrink.
Look at "struct task_struct", for example. Right now it has two spinlocks 
right next to each other (alloc_lock and pi_lock).
Other data structures may have things like bitfields etc.
But yeah, I'd not expect that to be very common, and in some cases you 
might have to re-order data structures to take advantage of better 
packing, and even then it's probably not all that noticeable.

Oh, absolutely.
