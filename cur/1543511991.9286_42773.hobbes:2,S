That is the point: There are _two_ interfaces to the driver. As a driver
author I must make sure _both_ work, so I must study both; I'll have to
compile four kernels (devfs/module) just to check that it doesn't break. I
must check that I don't hijack a major number, and that I don't take over
the device name for something else (this has to be done in the driver, if I
understand a recent post correctly). I must set up a default permission in
the driver, and also add it to MAKEDEV.
