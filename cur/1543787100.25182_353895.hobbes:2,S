Hey Bernhard, Thomas, Jeff,
This bug was the product of my flagrant attempts to defy the C
standard of sizeof(long) == sizeof(void *).  Apparently, I have failed
to slip it into the kernel once again.  Super props go to me since I
even have an Athlon 64 machine and didn't commit it to testing this.
Jeff, please accept this revised patch in place of the original patch
2, the only difference being the change suggested above.
Thanks to Thomas Lustig and Bernhard Schrenk for both pointing this out!
