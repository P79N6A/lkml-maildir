A quick glance through it:
dsp3780I_WriteDStore still touches user space with a spinlock held
(also doesnt check the get_user return)
The ioctl handlers do not check copy_from_user/to_user returns
IOCTL_MW_UNREGISTER_IPC will oops if fed bogus info (ipcnum should be
unsigned)
The return should be -ENOTTY not -ENOIOCTLCMD  unless its internal code
that catches NOIOCTLCMD and changes it before user space sees it
mwave_Read should be -EINVAL not -ENOSYS (ENOSYS means the entire read syscall
in the OS isnt there)
In debug mode mwave_write accesses user space directly and may crash
(buf[0])
Trivial item - coding style uses foo(void) not foo() to indicate functions
taking no arguments
Still have globals like "dspio" "uartio"  "ClaimResources" etc
whats wrong with tp3780_uart_io etc for globals ?
Otherwise it looks close to ready
