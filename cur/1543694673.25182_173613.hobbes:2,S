;-) No problem. 
But if someone with a small cache would actually *measure* the damned 
thing, I'd be more impressed ... I've never seen that, but perhaps
I just missed it. 
Point is the same either way though ... we shouldn't unconditionally
optimise for *anyone's* system. If it's faster on all systems that anyone
can be bothered to measure, great. If it's faster on some, and slower on
others, a config option seems more appropriate, defaulting to the majority
of users.
