Hi again,
After some small investigation, it seems that:
« Some products in some categories (PC, PDA) will be able to accept
Memory Stick PRO media by upgrading firmware or software. (Available
advantage is high capacity only.) »
Read at the bottom of this page:
http://www.memorystick.com/en/ms/features2.html
Moreover, on this page:
http://ciscdb.sel.sony.com/perl/news-display.pl?news_id=15
I can see that Vaio laptop similar to mine (C1MW and C1MWP) can be
upgraded to read Memory stick Pro...
So, I guess that it is possible. But why is the Linux driver refusing it
?
I'll try this out.
PS: Who is the maintainer of the Memory Stick driver ?
Regards
