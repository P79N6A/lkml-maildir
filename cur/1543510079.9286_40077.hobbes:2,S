Not true. In ANSI/ISO C, a null pointer constant is either an integer
constant expression with the value 0, or such an expression cast to
void*. NULL expands to an implementation defined null pointer
conatant, so both
#define NULL (void*)0
and
#define NULL 0
are suitable, and the latter also meets the C++ standard.

That's perfectly correct, and is the traditional definition in order
to support pre-standard C compilers, but not strictly necessary on
Linux where all the widely and not-so-widely used C compilers support
the standard.
