They've also broken syscalltrack, and I'll be surprised if they care. 
Would someone please explain to me why a mechanism which *is* safe
under certain circumstances[1] is removed *without any suitable
alternative for modules*[2], just because it's "ugly"? We've had this
discussion before, numerous times. Ref:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=101820103913072&w=2 
I agree that it should not be done. I maintain that sometimes, if you
want to keep your code as a module only (because forcing users to
recompile their kernel is not a viable solution) it can be done safely
if you observe certain precautions and your architecture supports
it[3]. So why remove it?

[2] Can the LSM hooks be used for notification and modification on
every system call's entry and exit?  
[3] I'd like to know if I'm wrong, of course.
