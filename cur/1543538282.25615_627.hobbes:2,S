Hmm, that's a nice idea.  Does it improve performance?

spin_lock() should leave the irq state well alone, whether it spins or
not.  The only thing that may be interesting to change is
spin_lock_irqsave() -- that could be made to behave "as if" interrupts
are not disabled until the moment the lock is actually acquired.
(I.e. by restoring the irq state while spin-reading).
I don't know if there are any performance gains, or fairness issues that
may arise.  But as far as lock safety goes, that is perfectly safe.  It
simply changes the timing.
