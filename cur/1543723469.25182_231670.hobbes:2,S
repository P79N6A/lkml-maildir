Subject: [PATCH] task name handling in proc fs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

We've seen the the top command segfault when dealing with a badly (very
badly) formed task name obtained from a 'stat' file in proc fs.  Upon
further examination, it appears that the task name could be updated at
the same time it is handed off to sprintf in proc_pid_stat().  Now one
could argue that top should be more intelligent and deal with these
badly formed names.  However, I think it's bad to be passing strings that
could be changing to sprintf within the kernel.  I'm pretty sure sprintf
expects the character strings to be static.  Below is a patch to address
this code and one other place dealing with task names in the same file.
