So how does this work? You ask the slab allocator how many pages you
need for a given number of objects and then those pages are available
to it via the page allocator? Can other users also dip into those
reserves?
I would prefer we simply have an API for telling the slab allocator to
keep certain number of pages in a reserve for a cache rather than
exposing internals such as object size to rest of the world.
