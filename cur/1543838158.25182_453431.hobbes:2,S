Is there a (remote) possibility that the thread could have died and its
pid got reused by a new thread in another process ? Or is there a mechanism
that prevents such a possibility from arising (not just in NPTL library,
but at the kernel level) ?
I think the timer code saves a reference to the task pointer instead of
the pid, which is what I was suggesting above (instead of the euid checks),
as way to avoid the above situation.

OK. I updated my patchset against 2618-rc3 just after OLS.

AIO for pipes should not be a problem - Chris Mason had a patch, so we can
just bring it up to the current levels, possibly with some additional
improvements.
I'm not sure what would be the right thing to do for the sockets case. While
we could put together a patch for basic aio_read/write (based on the same
model used for files), given the whole ongoing kevent effort, its not yet
clear to me what would make the most sense ...  
Ben had a patch to do a fallback to kernel threads for AIO operations that
are not yet supported natively. I had some concerns about the approach, but
I guess he had intended it as an interim path for cases like this.
Suggestions would be much appreciated ?  DaveM, Ingo, Andrew ?
