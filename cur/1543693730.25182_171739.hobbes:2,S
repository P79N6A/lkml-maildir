I wouldn't expect a hotplug feature for differing CPU types actually. But in
fact there are boxes out there that complain via phonecall that a processor
board just died and request replacement. Same goes for RAM. It is obvious that
no feature like this exists on desktop nowadays, but 2.7 and release of 2.8 is
far ahead, so I see no good reason why people should not be enabled to do this
- _then_ .
In fact it is sounds really simple to plug in additional boards to a numa-type
box. Boards meaning RAM+CPU.
HP builds hotplug PCI stuff in comparably cheap boxes, so this is not
completely off-reality.

This direction sounds likely.
