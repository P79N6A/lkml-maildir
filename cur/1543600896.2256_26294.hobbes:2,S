Yes, I'm doing the second of those.  No alternative -- I need write
access from some hosts, and read access to all the rest (who are
dynamically allocated) on the subnet.
It's clearly a bug in the NFS server then.

/etc/exports:
# I want ro granted to all hosts in the 172.30.* subnet, but rw
# granted to the machines in @aquarius_outside which is within that
# subnet.  Doesn't work, whichever order I write the lines.
# (The machines in @aquarius_hosts always get read only access).
#
# Solution, though I don't like it: write the host names explicitly.
#
# The 192.168.64.192/19 subnetwork is for temporarily assigned IPs on
# the Aquarius test network.  /kickstart is used for kickstart
# installations on machines plugged in temporarily.
