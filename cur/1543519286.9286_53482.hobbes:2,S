Why is it that people *always* have to degrade a technical discussion 
into name calling and flame throwing. If you don't agree with what I 
have to say, so be it. I don't agree with what you have to say. But I 
won't go about calling people names and other such ridiculous things.
Why can't you guys learn to just grow up and learn a little 
professionalism? Alan Cox does not agree at all with what I say, but 
I didn't see him calling me names? Even though I don't always agree 
with what he says, I still highly repsect his opinion.
