Okay, if that happens on your drive, you gotta burn that foul thing and 
run away as fast/far away as you can.  ;-)

Dunno about IDE layer.  It has been done that way for long time and not 
sure whether adding such option will happen, but for libata, hpa 
handling is still not implemented and it will have to be optional when 
it gets implemented.  So, libata will have such option when it finally 
receives implementation for hpa handling.
