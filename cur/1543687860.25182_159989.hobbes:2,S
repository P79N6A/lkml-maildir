I've been meaning to give the FAQ a thorough going over for a while now.  
(Bits of it are a lot more stale than 2002.)
I sent Richard a FAQ patch a month ago, which he hasn't responded to, but he 
claims to still be active:

I sent him the patch in question on July 17th, but haven't heard anything 
back.  (I've been a bit out of touch in the past month myself getting back 
into grad school, buying a condo, moving, etc, and haven't followed up yet.)
If Richard doesn't have time to do it anymore, and there are patches backing 
up, I could give it a whack.  I'm not exactly dripping with free time myself 
at the moment, but I usually catch up with all the important pending things 
at least once a week.  However, I don't want to usurp anybody's 
maintainership.  (I was planning on possibly making my own tree and then 
feeding him incremental patches at whatever rate he responds...)
