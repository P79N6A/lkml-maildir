Yes. And 'alpine', it's modern version, does even better, but you also 
need to make sure to disable "downgrade-multipart-to-text".
I've been using alpine for a while now, and it's nice to see it be utf-8 
capable and able to handle other charsets well.
So as a former pine user, I can recommend upgrading.
