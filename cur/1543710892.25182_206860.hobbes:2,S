No, that isn't the case. The memory usage stays constant and it has no swap
used at all.

Nothing when it would switch back to a normal state.:-) As I already
mentioned when processes begins to hang, all file operations like tail -f
/var/log/messages etc. then hangs too:-( Not even a login or a proper shutdown will
work. I have to press CTRL-SYSRQ-X
So I think it is something wrong with 2.6 on alpha:-) I have absolutely no
problems with 2.4.
