This is what I stated, maybe someday the rest of the distros will get with
it and support that which is widely used and expected now.
Until then you have to patch, development kernels, or use SuSE.
If there are other distros like Turbo (I think they are using it now), and
one other in Europe that was the first before SuSE.
