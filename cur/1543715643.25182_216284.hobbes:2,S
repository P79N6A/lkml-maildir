Well, I always thought that the only file system IO that GFP_FS is
expected to do is one issued by ->writepage. Doing truncate from within
VM scanner looks... wrong. But that's not the point, actually. Current
d_splice_alias leads to the following problems with NFS (and may be
other remote file systems also):
 * there are more dentries than nlinks for a given file, as a result
 * file (not opened by user) is not truncated when its last name is
   removed. inode is pinned in the memory indefinitely by remaining
   disconnected dentries.
 * sequence "touch x; rm x" always creates _two_ dentries for "x": one
   disconnected (by ->decode_fh) and one connected (by lookup_one_len
   from nfs unlink request).
I think that d_splice_alias() should be changed to scan inode->i_dentry
list and d_move() any disconnected dentry found into new one.
