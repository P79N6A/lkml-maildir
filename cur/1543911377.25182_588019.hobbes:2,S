My impression as an SPI member is that in practice most SPI members come 
from the SPI projects [1], and due to Debian's size Debian developers 
are the majority of SPI members.
If you elect at KS it'll favor kernel developers.
If you let all SPI members elect it'll favor Debian developers.
The Linux Foundation homepage says "The Technical Advisory Board (TAB) 
provides the Linux kernel community a direct voice into The Linux 
Foundation’s activities...". If this is the intention, an election at 
the KS is the best solution.
