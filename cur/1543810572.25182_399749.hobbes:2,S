free_pgtables() has partial crap that the check of is_hugepage_only_range()
should be done on the entire vma range, not just the first hugetlb page.
Though, it's not possible to have a hugetlb vma while having normal page
instantiated inside that vma.  So the bug is mostly phantom.  For
correctness, it should be fixed.
