Huh?  Rebooting through the BIOS and kexec are pretty much mutually exclusive.
Looking at the patch I can't see what you are talking about either.
Does kexec successfully work under VMWare?

machine_halt actually is not one of those places.
machine_halt does not want to stop the processor.  It is very much
about killing the kernel and user space but having the software still
linger a little.
This needs a cleaner abstraction to make sense or go in.
