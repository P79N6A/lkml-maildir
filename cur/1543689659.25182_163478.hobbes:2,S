Unfortunately that's not a good solution for me.  The file has already 
been opened without O_DIRECT, and O_DIRECT wouldn't be appropriate because 
most of the time I do want I/O to go through the cache.  It's just on a 
few rare occasions that I need direct access to the disk.
Maybe simply opening a new struct file using O_DIRECT, for purposes of 
the verification, while keeping the old struct file around for other uses 
later, will work?  That would be awkward though -- and there's no 
guarantee that the original filename would still exist.  It would be a lot 
nicer to do everything using the original file reference.
