Getting this on both x86 and x86_64 boxes, they are the older boxen so
likely older compilers:
  CC      arch/x86_64/boot/memory.o
arch/i386/boot/memory.c: In function `detect_memory':
arch/i386/boot/memory.c:32: error: can't find a register in class `DREG'
while reloading `asm'
Seems to come from git-netsetup, but that tree isn't pulled into your
git version of -mm so I can't be more specific.
