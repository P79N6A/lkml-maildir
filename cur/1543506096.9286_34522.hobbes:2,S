We are developing a driver that communcitates with a prototype board,
currently using the parallel port.  When used heavily, it's causing
strange networking problems.
First, other machines have trouble mounting exports from the machine
running this driver.
Secondly, the machine running the driver frequently says:
Aug 17 10:54:53 pacpc3 kernel: Warning: possible SYN flood from 139.85.24.54 on
139.85.24.52:635.  Sending cookies.
What's this all about?
