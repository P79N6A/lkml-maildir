It would certainly fit most usages, but as soon as we find another group
of users complaining, we will add another sysctl just for them ? Perhaps
we could just resume the two current sysctls into one called
"interactivity_boost" with a value between 0 and 100, with the ability
for any user to increase or decrease it easily ? Mainline would be
pre-configured with something reasonable, like what Mike proposed as
default values for example, and server admins would only set it to
zero while desktop-intensive users could increase it a bit if they like
to.

I generally agree on this, except that we got caught once in this area for
this exact reason.
