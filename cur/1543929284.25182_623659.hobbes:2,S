Actually, IMHO, there is no reason for any lockdep violation:
thread #1: has down_read(A); waits for #2 to down_write(B)
thread #2: has down_write(B); never waits for #1 to down_read(A)
So, deadlock isn't possible here. If lockdep reports something else it
should be fixed (and you'd be right to omit lockdep until this is
done).
