Yes.  One of the reasons I keep Aunt Tillie in mind as a UI target is that
if I can design a configuration system that makes the task possible for her,
then I'll have one that makes it easy for this much larger class of 
intermediate-level users.

In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession 
or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches 
in length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to the 
preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot 
say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear 
such an instrument. [...] The Militia comprised all males 
physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense.
