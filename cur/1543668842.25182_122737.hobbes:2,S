Yes, was my root fs.

Not easily, I fear ... since it's a pain in the butt to remove an ext3
journal on the root fs once mounted. I suppose I could boot from CD
or something ... will try to recreate on a less valuable box over
the weekend ;-)
I had been having some other trouble with the fs (power cycled a couple
of times for silly reasons), but it had just ext2 fscked. I suppose there
*might* have been some corruption, but seems unlikely.
