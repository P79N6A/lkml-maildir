I like this, however:

Are you sure? This will set sysrq_down only if ALT has already been
pressed. If SysRq does not autorepeat and it is pressed first we won't
ever see sysrq_down. Am I missing something?

What about alt? I think that "if (...) sysrq_active = 1;" statement
should go down, below handle_sysrq block.

We also need to check if emulate_raw() needs to be adjusted...
