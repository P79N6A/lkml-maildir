I did too. My experiences were mixed: on 32bit it was slower,
on 64bit faster on average.  Strangely the 32bit version ran
faster again without -fomit-frame-pointer, so it's likely
some funny interaction with 32bit long long code generation.
The difference is never more than 100 cycles so it shouldn't
be a big issue either way.
For some input arguments (<1% in my testing)
it also gave an answer 1 off from the existing code, 
but I don't think that's a problem.
But more importantly during testing I found that the cubic
code gives a division by zero for input arguments >2^43. If you
have a system with >16TB of memory this could actually be a remotely
exploitable bug :)
I still think it's a good idea to switch to the new function,
especially since it's shorter code.
Here's the patch. Note I didn't verify it with real large window
TCP operations; only unit testing.

Use Hacker's delight cube root algorithm in cubic TCP
Shorter code and fixes a theoretically remote exploitable bug.
