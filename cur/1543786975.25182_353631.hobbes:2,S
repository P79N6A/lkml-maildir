Or instead of even needing major/minor we just have:
/sys/class/sound
       `- - audio0
                |
                | - raw
        `-- dsp0
                |
                | - raw
Then instead, let udev know that audio0 and dsp0 belong to one sound card 
device or have it report this in sysfs:
/dev/class/sound
       `--sound0     
               | 
               | -- dev
               | -- device -> ../../../devices/pci0000:00
               `-- audio0
                     |- device  -> ../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1f.5
               `--dsp0
                     | -device -> ../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1f.5
               `--mixer0 
        `--sound1
               |
               | -dev   
               | -- device -> ../../../devices/pci0000:00:1a
               `--audio0
                       |- device 
--> ../../../devices/pci0000:00:1a/0000:00:1c.6
And so forth.
Then map sound0 devices in /dev/dsp0 /dev/mixer0 /dev/audio0  with udev
*NOTE: I am not avocating devfs, but more of keeping sysfs as the primary 
structure for devices.
