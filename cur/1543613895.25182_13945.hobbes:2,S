I attribute the lack of technical discussion to the least common denomiator
culture of the Linux community and not the merits of the actual technical
system itself. That's what linux-aio@ is for...
And using lkml as a AIO forum is probably outside of the scope of this list
and group.

Yeah, but the overall Unix community probably has something different to say
about that, certainly. Even in BSD/OS, this JVM project I've been working on is
recognized as one of the most important systems second (probably) only to the
kernel itself. And, IMO, they have a more balanced view of this language
system and the value of it economically as a money making platform instead of
showing off to their peers. It's a greatly anticipated project in all of the
BSDs.
That's my semi-obnoxious take on it. ;-)
