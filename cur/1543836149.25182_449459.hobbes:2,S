I am not sure if there is a version of BUG_ON() for compile time
asserts. Basically, if we have an infrastructure of the form
/*
  * From C/C++ users journal November 2004
  */
#define STATIC_BUG_ON(e) 	\
	switch (0) {		\
	case  0:		\
	case (e):		\
		;		\
	}
Then the STATIC_BUG_ON() can catch as shown below.
#define TASK_COMM_LEN 	16
#define T_COMM_LEN	20
int
main(void)
{
	STATIC_BUG_ON(TASK_COMM_LEN == T_COMM_LEN);
}
STATIC_BUG_ON gives the following warning
bug_on_c.c: In function `main':
bug_on_c.c:19: duplicate case value
bug_on_c.c:19: previously used here
but with T_COMM_LEN set to 16
It compiles without any errors, the code generated also
looks like it has no overhead
int
main(void)
{
  8048310:       55                      push   %ebp
  8048311:       89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp
  8048313:       83 ec 08                sub    $0x8,%esp
  8048316:       83 e4 f0                and    $0xfffffff0,%esp
         STATIC_BUG_ON(TASK_COMM_LEN == T_COMM_LEN);
}
  8048319:       c9                      leave
  804831a:       c3                      ret
  804831b:       90                      nop
Assuming such infrastructure is available, you could then
do
#ifdef __KERNEL__
#include <linux/sched.h>
#define TS_COMM_LEN	16
STATIC_BUG_ON (TS_COMM_LEN == TASK_COMM_LEN);
#endif
