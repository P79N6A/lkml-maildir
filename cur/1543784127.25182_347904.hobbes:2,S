Do you have any *serious* intent to drop 10 *megabytes* worth of driver
into the kernel??? (Hint - *everything* in drivers/net/wireless *totals*
to only 2.7M).
A Linux device driver isn't the same thing as a Windows device driver - much of
a Windows driver is considered "userspace" on Linux, and you're free to do that
in C++ if you want.
