So isn't that obviously NOT the right way to do it?
What would you do if that disk broke?
For situations like that, you want completely separate hardware. On  
separate UPSen. On separate power lines. Probably in different cities.  
(California-style earth quakes. Tchernobyl-style nuclear plant blowups.  
Australia-style power cable burnouts.)
Dual-ported disks is not a desaster plan.
(I remember hearing of a desaster plan of a big manufacturer - making hard  
disks or something like that - they supposedly had a complete second setup  
at the other side of the city, and the plan said "if something takes out  
both places, we're going to have more serious trouble than caring about  
hard disk production".)
Fsck times is just about the least important thing in that situation,  
because if that's what you're waiting for, you didn't do your homework.
