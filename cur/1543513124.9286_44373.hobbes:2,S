There is some information at
http://developer.soundblaster.com/linux/live_faq.html#ReleaseSource
It says they will release a binary driver with some source code so that it
can be recompiled for different kernel versions. Expected release date is
1Q 2000.
Not good enough, IMO. This may be the last Creative product I buy.
