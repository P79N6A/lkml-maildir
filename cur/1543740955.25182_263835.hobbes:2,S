interrupts are disabled. You used a -RT-U10.2/3 kernel, and have 
CONFIG_REALTIME enabled, right? Do you have this in 
drivers/net/netconsole.c, line 77:
 #ifdef PREEMPT_REALTIME
         /*
          * A bit hairy. Netconsole uses mutexes (indirectly) and
          * thus must have interrupts enabled:
          */
         local_irq_enable();
 #endif
correct? Could you do this a few lines below:
                WARN_ON_RT(irqs_disabled());
                netpoll_send_udp(&np, msg, frag);
                WARN_ON_RT(irqs_disabled());
to figure out who disables interrupts. Also, could you add the same two
lines to net/core/netpoll.c, line 83:
        WARN_ON_RT(irqs_disabled());
        np->dev->poll_controller(np->dev);
        WARN_ON_RT(irqs_disabled());
and send me either the full bootlog, or the _first_ such BUG message
you'll be getting. Which network controller is this?
