New findings:
  - The problem doesn't happen with kernels <= 2.2.17. It does happen with all
    kernels starting with 2.2.18-pre1.
  - The only related stuff that changed in 2.2.18-pre1 seems to be the
    Sym53c8xx driver itself. I'll do some more tests soon to isolate the
    problem.
  - The changes to the Sym53c8xx driver in 2.2.18-pre1 are _huge_. Are the
    individual changes between sym53c8xx-1.3g and sym53c8xx-1.7.0 available
    somewhere?
BTW, I wrote a small test program which tries to analyze error bursts. You can
find it at 
http://home.tvd.be/cr26864/Download/genpseudorandom.c
Sample test using 200000000 bytes of data:
    genpseudorandom -o -l 200000000  > /dev/tape
    genpseudorandom -i < /dev/tape
So far I always saw problems when writing even only 10 MB to tape: ca. 3-5
bursts of 32 or 12 incorrect bytes, which are always a copy of the
corresponding bytes in the previous block. Of course I used a much larger test
stream to verify 2.2.17.
Thanks!
