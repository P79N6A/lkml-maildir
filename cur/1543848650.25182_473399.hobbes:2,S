Subject: [PATCH] IDE: typedef struct clean-up
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/16/106

From: Vegard Nossum <vegard@peltkore.net>
Replaces typedefs with struct-constructs for large parts of the IDE API
and drivers. No semantic changes. Rationale: CodingStyle, chapter 5.

Applies to Linus's 2.6 tree.
I figured that this kind of easy/routine job would make for a gentle
introduction to kernel programming. However, what is the general opinion
of this kind of work, should it be done or not? (I realize that I may be
challenging some established habits with these changes.)
Also, what are the rules for enum and function-pointer typedefs?
CodingStyle does not discuss these cases.
Complete patch is 376K and follows as a link. This violates point 6 of
SubmittingPatches (no links), but is justified by point 7 (e-mail size).
