But /share/$USER is surely not bind mounted to ~$USER/share in the
_global_ namespace, is it?  I can't see any sense in that.

I acknowledge, that it can be done.  My point was that it can be done
more simply _without_ using CLONE_NS.

I'm not saying there's any contradiction, I'm saying rbind+chroot is a
better fit.
I haven't yet heard a single reason why a per-session namespace with
parts shared per-user is better than just a per-user namespace.
