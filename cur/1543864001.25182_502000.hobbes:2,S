Nope, regular command, regular "register".  It contains other
stuff than the assigned card number, like manufacturer ID,
product name and product revision, see 5.2 in the simplified
standard.  There are variants that match what you say, maybe you
mean ALL_SEND_CID.

Time to set up tx DMA versus not doing anything, I guess 1-byte
buffers (DMA all the time or bust) matter the most.

Perhaps define it as active whenever it's "claimed", and don't
deactivate it for each command.

Dunno if that idiom maps well.  The clock is off between
transfers anyway.

If everything works, error handling is unnecessary. :)

IMHO it's so rare that cards are de/inserted that it'd be a
waste of interrupt lines.

Not this line.  Only the expensive ones, saved for more

Name chapter and verse?  I see "4.4 Clock Control" says 100-400
KHz and SanDisk's OEM MMC v1.3 document referred to before, says
in "Table 3-7 Bus Timing" max 400 KHz.
