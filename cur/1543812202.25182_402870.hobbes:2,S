That's an excellent point.  It does look like fixing
pci_enable_device_bars() would be a reasonable interface as well.
Currently, pci_enable_device() calls pci_enable_device_bars() on all
resources, and then does two more things:
    - It calls pci_fixup_device() on the device
    - It sets dev->is_enabled
Both of these things look like they could just be moved into
pci_enable_device_bars(), leaving pci_enable_device() as a
compatibility wrapper.
Along with a fix for pci_request_regions(), the legacy-free patch
would just modify drivers for devices that know they don't need a
particular BAR, without adding an extra flag to the pci device struct.
