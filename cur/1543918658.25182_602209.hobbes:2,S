Yes.  However last I looked at the LSM hooks we first do the normal unix
permission checks.  Then we run the hook.  So it can only increase the
number of times we say -EPERM.

Yes.  However if you look at what the first implementations were.  Especially
something like linux-vserver.  All they provided was isolation.  So perhaps
you would not see every process ps but they all had unique pid values.
I'm pretty certain Serge at least prototyped a simplified version
of that using the LSM hooks.  Is there something I'm not remember in
those hooks that allows hiding of information like processes?
Yes. Currently with containers we are taking that one step farther as
that solves a wider set of problems.

True.  Probably a more accurate statement is:`unix command line power
users can and do handle it after reading the docs.  That's not quite
ordinary mortals but it feels like it some days.  It might all be
perception...

Ok.  There is something here.
However in a generic setup, at least role would be an extended match
criteria provided by the selinux module.  It would not be a core
attribute.  It would need to depend on some extra functionality being
compiled in.

How about thinking of it another way.  
Perform the split up you talked about above and move the table
matching into the LSM hooks.
Use something like the iptables action and match to module mapping
code so we can have multiple modules compiled in and useable at the
same time with the LSM hooks.
I think it is firmly established that selling SElinux to everyone is
politically untenable.  However enhancing the LSM (even if it is
mostly selinux code movement down a layer) I think can be sold.
If I could run Serge's isolation code and selinux rules at the same
time that would be interesting. 
My impression is that selinux is one monolithic blob that doesn't
allow me to incrementally add matching or action features that I
find interesting.
