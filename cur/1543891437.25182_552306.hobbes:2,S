Wait, wasn't this the entire purpose of affected_cpus in the first
place? So we could see which CPUs would be affected by a frequency
change?  What went wrong here?

This I think is where the problem started.  That these remained
independant.  Changing one should also affect the others that it
'affects'. Is that not the case?

If 'affected_cpus' doesn't do the right thing, I'd vote for making it
do so over adding more interfaces.
