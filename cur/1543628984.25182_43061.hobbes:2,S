What next, gcc warnings that include sections of the C99 standard or
chunks of the info entry?  There are reasons that documentation is
separate from error and warning messages.
Summary:
  Nobody can agree on the warning text.  Anything less than the full
  kernel FAQ entry is incomplete.
  Vendors who ship binary modules and support their users should use
  different text, pointing to the vendor's support policy instead of
  bothering linux-kernel.
Solution:
  modutils 2.4.16 says
  Warning: loading <module> will taint the kernel.  Reason <reason>
    See <TAINT_URL> for information on tainted modules
  Module loaded, with warnings
  Printing 'Module loaded, with warnings' makes it clear that the
  module has been loaded.  TAINT_URL defaults to lkml FAQ.  Vendors can
  ship modutils with a TAINT_URL that points to their support policy.
