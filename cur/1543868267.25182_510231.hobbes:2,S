I think yes, as a first step.
In the long term, I think it would be really nice to have CLONE_KERNEL_THREAD
(filtered out in sys_clone). This also allows us to cleanup copy_process().
For example, we can then introduce CLONE_UNHASHED (currently denoted as pid==0)
and kill the ugly "int pid" copy_process's parameter.
