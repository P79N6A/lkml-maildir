See what I meant, Benoit?

You still didn't get it, right?
b44-ssb is a SSB device driver. No PCI, nothing. To get this working
on PCI you need to enable the PCI glue. Which is enabled by default.
It even includes the comment "Say Y". If you say N nevertheless it's
your fault.
What's so hard to understand about this? We have LOTS of drivers in the
kernel that work _exactly_ the same way. There is a base module to drive
the hardware and several glue drivers. If you de-select the glue driver
it doesn't work.
If you use your old config and do not DISABLE some option you will
not experience a regression (at least regarding to the kconfig stuff.
There's still your transmission bug left).

My task is _nothing_. This is opensource. If you don't like
something about it, go and fix it. But don't say it's the _task_ of others
to fix things you don't like. I am not payed to do this for you.
Though, I'd like to resolve it.

I explained it several times now. I'm not sure what else I should
say about it.
