However, one can have multipe POSIX timers, just as you can 
have multiple timerfd timers; nevertheless POSIX timers provide
the get and get-while-setting functionality.

I agree my proposed API is not as clean as it could be, that's why
I would favour:

Or better still, have timerfd() integrated with POSIX tiemrs (if
this is feasible).  This givesus a simple API, exactly one new
syscall, and all of the functionality of the existing POSIX
timers API.

Not sure what your concern is here.  The total amount of 
new code for all of these options is pretty small.
Cheers,
