Yes, I suppose it should be.

Actually, 'embed_configfile /proc/kcore.info /vmlinux-kdump' makes
no on-disk modification, since it is all contained in initramfs (we
step out of initramfs in stage 5). 
BTW another option would be containing the whole CONFIGFILE as a 
vmlinux-specific ELF note, to be easily read from /proc/vmcore.
You'd still need some util like embed_configfile at build time 
in order to integrate it, and you'd also need to modify 
makedumpfile so it can use it. Actually this sounds quite better
to me. I'll try to prepare patches both for makedumpfile and the 
kernel and see how easy it is.

That needs to be changed.. the part in makedumpfile that generates 
the CONFIGFILE shouldn't depend on the running kernel at all. As 
Ken'ichi suggests we don't need to have 'OSRELEASE=' in the 
CONFIGFILE (instead, peeking inside init_uts_ns from /proc/vmcore
is enough). For PAGESIZE, it can be replaced by readmem() of some
variable such as:
         unsigned int image_page_size = PAGE_SIZE;
With the system I propose for generation and delivery of the 
CONFIGFILE, it would be impossible to pass an incorrect CONFIGFILE
since the kernel will already contain its own CONFIGFILE generated
during build time (assuming it didn't get corrupted in the crash,
it's quite far-fetched...).

Ken'ichi's "mkdfinfo" works for me.
