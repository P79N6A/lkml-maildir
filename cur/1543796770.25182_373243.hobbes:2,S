An excellent point! 
There are two functions that might seem appropriate for a timestamp:
current_kernel_time()
do_gettimeofday()
	The former has jiffies resolution and hence may not be sufficient to
distinguish ordering between two events in the same process. The second
is interpolated wall time and may not necessarily monotonic. 
	Most other methods, such as get_cycles(), reading the tsc, etc. are not
SMP-safe or do not provide the needed resolution. Hence the patch gets
the time in nanoseconds and converts to a monotonicly increasing value.
	I'll split out a similarly-named function (get_timestamp exists in
ibmasm.c) to kernel/time.c and repost as two patches.
Thanks,
