What's "correct size" for directory ? If I have 1MiB directory where ls will
work few minutes but with only two entries in it ("." and "..") -- what's
the size of this directory ? 16 bytes or 1MiB ? You can create such beast
easily: just create few thousands of files in one directory and then remove
all of them.

Not always. HPFS and NTFS use B-trees and there are plans to do it in ext2fs
as well...

Not always (see above).

Regular file does not have unused space in the middle of file (from filesystem
viewpoint that is).
