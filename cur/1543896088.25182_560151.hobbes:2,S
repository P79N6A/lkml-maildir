The sad part is that the FCC, especially, are pretty fond of doing
exactly that.  This comes more from a general cluelessness about
technology (FCC is mostly stuffed with political shills which have more
to do with who stuffed money into the current President's campaign than
anything else) than malice, but "not modifiable by the end user" is a
common requirement in FCC regulations, which have the force of law.
