Hello!
   Subject says it all, inode->i_blocks always 0, in ramfs, and never updated
   (the only updated thing is inode->i_size).
   This breaks at least du(1). Ain't it should count blocks too, so that one
   can find how much ramfs is consuming in terms of memory by simply issuing
   du -ks ramfs_mount_point
Bye,
    Oleg
