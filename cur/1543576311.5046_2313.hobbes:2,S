I'm curious, is my method of avoiding the deadlock race the same as
yours?  My solution is to keep a count of tasks that 'intend' to take
the down():
        atomic_inc(&bdflush_waiters);
        up(&bdflush_request);
        down(&bdflush_waiter);
so that bdflush will issue the correct number of up's even if the waiter
has not yet gone to sleep.  IOW, is your approach in DYNIX the same only
in spirit, or in detail?
