USB used to be a big problem, but Greg and the other USB guys are doing great 
work, and it has improved a lot since 2.6.12.
The worst areas now are video drivers, particularly where DRI and/or Nvidia 
are involved.
Following that there are some is frequently used hardware such as firewire and 
hardware that people try to suspend less often, such as scsi. ACPI, cpufreq 
and the like have accounted for a share of problems in the past, but are 
generally ok now.
Hope that helps!
Nigel
