Subject: Process priority in 2.4.18 (RedHat 7.3)

Just installed RedHat 7.3 with kernel 2.4.18 and noticed that my network 
no longer functions when my CPU usage is at 100%.  Looking at the 
priorities of the application that I was running showed a priority of 35 
(thats what `nice ./test` produces).  Then looking at the priorities of 
all the other processes shows a range from 15 to 35.
All the main kernel processes run at 15 except ksoftirqd_CPU0 and 
ksoftirqd_CPU1 which run at 35.
None of the documentation on my system (`man nice` etc...) mentions
anything about priority levels between 15 and 35, they all say -20 to +20
(as it used to be).
So, why the change the priority levels?  And why my test app (at any 
priority level) starves out my network?
I am running an SMP box.
Thanks.
