Suresh's patch was wrong and this was intended as an alternative. 
Unfortunately, it is also in adequate and the setting of 
busiest_best_prio_seen needs to be moved to just after skip_for_load is 
set.  I have another patch that does that (and adds to the comments). 
Should I send that separately or roll the two patches together?
