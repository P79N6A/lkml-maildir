This one was broken too, I get whitespace removed at end of lines, and
lines wrapped. I think it's the "format=flowed" part of
	Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; format=flowed
and I'm fairly sure it's from your end (ie I have other emails in my
folder that do not have these problems).
You seem to be using Mulberry, I'm sure there must be some way to fix it,
but I don't know mb myself.
(I can edit and hand-apply patches like these, but I hate to do it, and I
really really hate to have developers with broken mail configurations, so
I'd rather go through this several times to get it fixed than to work
around it)
