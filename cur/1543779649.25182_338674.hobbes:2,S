For those interested, there is a discussion regarding pmu usage and
kernel functionality requirements happening on the perfctr mailing list
(perfctr-devel@lists.sourceforge.net). The goal is to understand what
functionality people need so that we can eventually have better support
for pmu's in the kernel.
