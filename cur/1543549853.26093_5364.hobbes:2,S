per-user and system-wide and per-process quotas are one thing, a
pre-allocate-and-then-allocate generic scheme seems to me to be a error prone
way of getting there. In particular, I think it is dangerous to have a pre-count that
is approximately tethered to the thing it is counting -- in the memory allocation 
we were discussing, you need to make sure that the pre-allocations are for memory that
is really going to be allocated soon and that it is later correlated with free in 
some way.  
So, to me, a quota bounded allocate_page_table(process_id) makes much more sense then 
pre-allocate counting, or, even worse, a "smart" kmalloc that never fails.
If the problem is unaccounted for page-tables then account for
page tables and return a  -EYOURPROCESSISOUTOFCONTROL so that calling kernel code
can take the responsible action.
