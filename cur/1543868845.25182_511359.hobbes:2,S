There is one here: "Missing critical phys_to_virt in lib/swiotlb.c".

It fixes a DMA related bug which was seen with a variety of drivers
especially on EM64T machines with more than 3GB RAM. I hope you can
extract the patch from this MIME attachment.
Adrian, AFAICS it applies as-is to 2.6.16.y too. I don't have a machine
to test personally, but it is quite obvious.
The mentioned bigger patch has been merged by Linus between 2.6.20 and
2.6.21-rc1.
