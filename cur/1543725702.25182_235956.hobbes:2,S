I haven't looked at any of these frameworks closely enough to answer
that. My comments were largely based on the observation that there are
several interesting projects that instrument the kernel (typically system
calls) to log information: auditing, performance, or something else.
All of them seem useful, but we can't keep adding hooks for each purpose.
It's like what we had before LSM (in a different area).

Well, it's _one_ key criteria. I suspect in this case the decisive
factor was rather the desire to please certain institutions that won't
consider an OS if it can't spy on its users <g>. But I'm making this up,
I'm sure someone remembers the real answer.
Quite frankly, I couldn't care less about auditing. I am much more
interested in tools that help me track down problems. Dprobes and LTT
do look promising. Then again, so did devfs.

No reason to be sarcastic. I didn't say nobody uses it. But those users
aren't exactly highly visible, either.
If you want a textbook example of how to spectacularly fail on this
very issue, recall the LKCD flame war (a couple of years ago?).

Heh, that's your job :-). Given that a Java/FORTH/whatever interpreter
is unlikely to be merged into mainline anytime soon, what excitement
can we still offer with the complex stuff living in user space?
Even if your goal is to beat DTrace eventually, you need to sell patches
on their own merits, not based on what we could do in some unlikely or
distant future. DTrace is a red herring, more interesting is what we
can do with, say, basic LTT infrastructure, or dprobes, etc.
