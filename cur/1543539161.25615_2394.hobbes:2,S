Howdy,
Trying to debug a problem on a 2.0.30-based system, I ran across the
following behavior:
ping -f ip_addy_of_my_ethernet_device  (or even the loopback interface)
will drop about 95% of the packets.  Sometimes more.  This seems to be
the case on both a DEC and 3Com cards, on both x86 and ppc platforms. 
This does not seem to happen at all on machines, both x86 and ppc,
running a 2.2.14 kernel.
Due to other issues (driver-porting and application-porting issues, not
to mention time), going up to 2.2.14 is not an option.
Does anyone know what the fix was for this, and possibly if it is fixed
in a later 2.0.x kernel (which one?).
Or is this just a problem with ping (don't know what version I'm
actually running & can't get the one in netkit-0.16 to compile just
now)?
As always, TIA.
