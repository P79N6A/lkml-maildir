Yep.  Just to be specific:
256 max sectors IDE driver, 200 max sectors libata (due to driver not 
hardware).
256 max s/g entries hardware limit, but due to a IOMMU merging worst 
case libata (IDE driver too?) winds up with a 128 entry practical limit.
Newer SATA controllers eliminate the s/g entry limit and DMA boundary 
limits, but its still 256 max-sectors for ATAPI (64k for LBA48 ATA).
