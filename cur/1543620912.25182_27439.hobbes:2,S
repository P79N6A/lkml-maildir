Problem is: It is NOT a real file. It's the '$MFT'. It is normally
hidden from userspace, but with a special option it becomes (partly,
as we've seen) visible.
Inode numbers make sense on NTFS, so it's a shame if you can't export
them "as is" to userspace.
Anton, How about a quick workaround: remap the $MFT inum to something
else. There are a couple of reserved inumbers in the 10-16 range,
right?
