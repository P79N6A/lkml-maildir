ack. understood. i was just asking since i don't have a second machine and
thus am not really able to help with the deadlock debugging. so i figured i
could at least do some timing. btw: even with deadlock detection, the
results for 0.6.5 looked pretty good [in 10 minutes uptime ca.3-4% max
jitter [30something usecs].  until the deadlock that is [i head three finds
plus kernel compile at nice -10 running]..
