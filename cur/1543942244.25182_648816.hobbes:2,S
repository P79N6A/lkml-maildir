The suggested patch of KOSAKI Motohiro didn't look like a lot of work to me.
I continue to prefer not to hijack this thread for that other discussion.
Just presenting your position and calling it "simple" is misleading.
The discussion so far has involved over a hundred messages over months,
and certainly your position, nor mine for that matter, obtained concensus.
How does the patch of KOSAKI Motohiro, earlier in this thread, look to you?
