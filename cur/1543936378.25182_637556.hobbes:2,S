So, instead of only relying on the tick to drive the RCU state machine,
you add the idle loop to it. This seems to make sense, esp because nohz
is held off until rcu is idle too.
Even though Andi is right in that its not the proper solution to your
problem, I think its worth doing anyway for the general benefit of RCU.
But lets ask Paul, he is Mr RCU after all :-)
