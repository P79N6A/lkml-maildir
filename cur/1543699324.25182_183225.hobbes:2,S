Apologies all round to anyone who feels offended.  What I meant to say 
is compression is not that difficult if you design the filesystem from 
the outset with compression in mind - retro fitting compression to an 
existing filesystem, however, can be very difficult (especially 
compressed metadata), and that's why it's not a good idea.
The concept that all well designed filesystems should easily support 
compression is wrong, and I didn't intend to imply that.
