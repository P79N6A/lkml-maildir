I think it should stay in procfs.  And we already have an mmu and a no-mmu
function there.

So provide a proper iterator once you do that.  Global lists are very
bad coding style.

shmem_zero_setup is already duplicated in shmem.c and tiny-shmem.c just
with different vm_ops.
So yes, please provide a set_devzero_vmops macro that is NULL for no-MMU
ports and allows to merge the existing two copies of the function.
