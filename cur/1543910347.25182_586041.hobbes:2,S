  The orinoco_cs driver fails to initialize the card, it doesn't read
proper value from SWSUPPORT0 register (or something like that, I don't
remember exactly). Driver sets some magic value there and expects to
read it back correctly, but that doesn't happen.

  Err, I did not mean your code, but handhelds.org one:). I need to ask
why it has been changed to the actual state -- precisely why it doesn't
use pxa core frequency, but memclk.
