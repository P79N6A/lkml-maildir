My PARAM code actually maps - to _ in parameter parsing, for exactly
this reason.  And only a complete idiot would put , in a module name,
so I don't care 8)

There's one piece of code I know which is linked in three places, and
has a module parameter (net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_conntrack_core.c, linked
into ipfwadm.o ipchains.o and ip_conntrack.o.
As it happens, the configuration doesn't allow more than one to be
built in (they can all be modules though), so it's not actually a
problem even after parameter unification.
Thanks,
Rusty.
