Hello
I have seen reference to kerneld in Rubini's Driver book, but dont see a
reference to that 
in the new 2.2 source. I saw instead a kmod which mentioned it replaces
kerneld, but then
some of the set_persist(), get_persist() for persistant storage is missing
any reference?
is this not yet released feature? or has it superceeded by a newer
mechanism?
thanks
ashokr
