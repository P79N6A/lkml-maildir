By design, a Stale File Handle means that something happened to an file
which is open over NFS.  The most likely cause is the local deletion of
a file which is being accessed remotely.  Right now, remote systems are
getting
Stale File Handle messages from Linux NFS servers which have had
problems (e.g. crashing) and then recovered.  Often this means that the
client machine cannot umount the Linux NFS partition and may be forced
to reboot to restore the connection.
Help is on the way!  See
