Great.

Shouldn't be a major problem. IIRC, the partport_pc is almost identical,
so the change should be trivial. Let's say "Next Monday".
Concerning a similar issues, the same vendor (NetMOS) provides two additional
parport chips besides the 9805 and 9815 (both of which are now supported).
Well, I *do* have the data for them, and the changes should be rather
straight forward, but I don't have the hardware to test them. I could write
up a patch, but that would rather render as "experimental".
Anyone in here with a NetMOS based parallel/serial expansion card not yet
supported? (-;
So long,
	Thomas
