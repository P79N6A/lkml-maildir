Don't get me wrong Donald, I like clusters a for a certain type of
applications they fit perfectly and they've a quasi proportional
scalability over the number of computational units.
So, I like clusters.
Quite sadly the real world has applications that cannot be easily fit in a
cluster environment like, for example, heavy threaded applications ( pls
do not start a thread topic from here ) or a more general
share-everything-over-computational-units kind.
Now this kind of design, that we can or cannot call crappy, exist in the
real world and is currently working for a _lot_ of Company's applications
servers.
Now we, as we're all smart guys, know that "work" is GOOD and nobody,
expecially heavy payed managers, is willing to change/rearchitect
something that is currently working.
So these guys are happily running their own application server until one
day they suddendly realize that they need more power.
Now they're going to face a dilemma, that is 1) use a standard
architecture big SMP machine ( high price ) 2) embrace a clustered
solution ( lower price ) having in this way to redesign their application.
I feel quite confortable in excluding SSI for the kind of applications I'm
talking about.
Since I've seen this scenario many many times I'm telling You that, by
followin the 1st theorem of "work" that states that "work is GOOD", our
poor high-salary-senior-manager is going to snatch solution 1 w/out even
thinking about.
No, I do not believe in 128 single CPU SMP machines but, if I've to watch
inside my pretty dirty crystal ball, I see multi-core CPUs as a technology
response to SMP request.
Yes, because after the 1st theorem of "work" there's the 1st lemma of
technology that states that "technology will always follow the
market request".
