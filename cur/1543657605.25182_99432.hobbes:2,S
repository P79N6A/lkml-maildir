so are you saying that there should be no backward dependencies
in the list of menus?  i remember just that in the 2.4 screens,
when you could select hardware sensors and then, on a 
subsequent screen, deselect I2C which would, as a result,
deselect sensors on that previous screen.
you're saying that, the way these menus are ordered, this
type of thing should be avoided?
