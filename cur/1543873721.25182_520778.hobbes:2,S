The finding of the zero bit is done without lock. (Search/lookup)
Then , the reservation of the found bit (test_and_set_bit) is done, and 
decrement of nr_free. It may fail because the search was done lockless.
Finding a zero bit in a 4096 bytes array may consume about 6000 cycles on 
modern hardware. Much more on SMP/NUMA machines, or on machines where 
PAGE_SIZE is 64K instead of 4K :)
You don't want to hold pidmad_lock for so long period.
