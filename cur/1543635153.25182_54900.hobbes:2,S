I'm seeing blue sky ;-)
Which IDE patch?

ide_sti() its just __sti() (except atari).
Note that ide_do_request() is called under spin_lock_irqsave(ch->lock,
flags). We have to unlock or we will get deadlock - imagine we are holding
lock and we get irq (shared irq, unexpected one) and we try to lock in
ata_irq_request() -> deadlock.
Also for most code in start_request() we dont need lock, we need it only
for calling block layer helpers, changing/reading IDE_BUSY bit and
ch->handler, timer and drive->rq.
Also we cannot disable interrupts, because we wont know when drive is
interrupting us, missed irqs.
Please also read my previous mails to Alex...
