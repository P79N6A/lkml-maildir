I wasn't able to boot a recent fetch from the vger CVS tree on my 4/330.
init barfed, complaining about undefined symbols.  Initially, I thought
that the disk was on the way out, but older kernels I have lying around
work fine..
The last kernels I ran on this box (it's too noisy to have on often :)
were, I think, a vger fetch from late January and 2.2.4ac1.  Both worked
without significant problems.
BTW, Pavel - does your 4/330 have a framebuffer?
Matthew.
