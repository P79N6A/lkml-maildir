2.6.20 from init 2 is no go either, -mm (-rc6-mm3) with minimal config [1] 
suspends, no key was able to resume it back, only power button, but monitor 
doesn't wake (actually I've this problem on another machine when X is not 
running) -- how to debug both of this? Do not suspend consoles? PM_TRACE (this 
won't help since it completely resumes, I guess)?
This is blindly written dmesg after resume. See it whole at [2]:

Do you want acpidump? Should I test 2.6.20 with minimal config?
