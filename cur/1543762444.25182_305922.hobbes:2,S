So just remove the pci_enable/disable_device call in the driver makes
the system work? Strange, I tried them on two laptops (one HP nx5000,
and one Toshiba M2N), both works (no hang, and USB mouse works after
S3/S4. I didn't try yenta, since I have no pc card) for S3/S4. Is it
possible it's another bug or just because of different BIOS?
