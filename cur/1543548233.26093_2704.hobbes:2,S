Subject: [PATCH] for PAS16 functionality for 2.4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/9/9/23

The PAS16 sound support includes code for the Soundblaster capability on
the card.  I found an apparent Makefile error which does not enable the
Soundblaster support as anticipated.  Adding SB support induces an error
for uart401 being included twice at various points of the build process.
The enclosed patch corrects the Makefile and makes appropriate changes
to various doc files.  Please consider accepting this for the next
kernel.  This patch is against 2.4.0-test8.
Alan:  would you like a patch for 2.2?  If so, against which kernel?
