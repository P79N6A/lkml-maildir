Hi,
     I want to have some clarification with regards to interrupts
     being edge or level triggered.
   1. How can I decide whether the interrupt is edge or level triggered
      other than data sheets and through oscilloscope.
   2. Can program PIC(Interrupt Controller 8259A)?
   3. If so how can I program PIC to set the mode as edge or level
      triggered interrupt mode.
   4. I want to have shared interrupts for two devices for which I need
      have interrupts for the two devices as level triggered.So I want
      to confirm whether the interrupt generated is level or edge
      triggered . How can I confirm? 
      If it is edge triggered then Can I change to level triggered?
   5. Data sheet of PIC tells that interrupt trigger mode can be
      programmed . How can this be programmed?
     Expecting reply
     with regards,
         Anil
