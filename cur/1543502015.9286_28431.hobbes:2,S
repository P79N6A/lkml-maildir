I'm sorry for not playing a larger part in this thread that I
started. The fact is, I prefer coding in C, and before this project,
I've never had any problems with the kernel headers. However, it seems
to me that if an incompatibility w/ C++ in the headers is very easily
fixed, there's no reason not to do so. I realize that there are lots
of quirks in the kernel headers that cause g++ to fail to compile, and
IMO these bugs should be squashed one at a time.
