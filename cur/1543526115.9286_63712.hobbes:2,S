One thought that might help with that, although I haven't the
experience to implement it: At the moment, there's (presumably) a
single flag somewhere in the kernel that states that a particular
partition is mounted either RO or RW.
Why not split this into two flags, one stating the desired mount state
of the partition (I'll call this MOUNT_RO herein), and a second
stating the current state of the partition (I'll call this CURRENT_RO
herein).
The following logic should then be possible:
 1. If MOUNT_RO is TRUE then CURRENT_RO is also true.
 2. When a partition is first mounted RW, MOUNT_RO is set FALSE
    but CURRENT_RO is set true and the partition is set up as
    if it had been mounted RO instead.
    The same would apply when `mount -o remount,rw` is applied
    to a partition that is currently mounted RO.
 3. When MOUNT_RO is FALSE and CURRENT_RO is TRUE and something
    happens to cause the kernel to want to write to it, the
    kernel first sets up the partition as a RW one, then sets
    CURRENT_RO to FALSE, and only then starts writing.
 4. When MOUNT_RO and CURRENT_RO are both FALSE but the kernel
    has written out everything it needs to AND a specified
    timeout has elapsed since it last had anything to write out,
    it first sets up the partition as if it was mounted RO,
    then sets CURRENT_RO to TRUE.
 5. When a partition is unmounted, if CURRENT_RO is FALSE, the
    kernel blocks until CURRENT_RO is TRUE, then proceeds to
    unmount the partition as requested.
As I see it, that would basically deal with the situation you refer
to, and would mean that a crash or powercut would only leave marked as
dirty those partitions that could actually be dirty.
Before anybody asks, the names used herein are only for the purpose of
this discussion, and should not be taken as being requirements as to
the names to be used if this is implemented.
Comments, anybody?
Best wishes from Riley.
