Hmm.. Looking a bit more at it, does this alternate patch work? It's 
_slightly_ less ugly, and it also removes the nonsensical TLB invalidate 
instead of moving it around together with the comment that says that it 
shouldn't exist.
The TLB is (properly) invalidated by "copy_one_pte()" if the mapping 
actually changes.
Did I miss anything?
