OK.

If you can enable the apic in earlier kernels and if that works OK then
bisection is an option.  Frankly, it's more likely to create a result,
mainly because we don't have an "apic maintainer" as such - the code in
there is largely the result of a lot of drive-by hacks.
So the question isn't so much "what information should I collect" as "to
whom should I send it".  And yes, this is a problem.
