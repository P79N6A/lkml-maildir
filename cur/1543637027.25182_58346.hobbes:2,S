99.9999% probability memory error. This may not be 'bad' memory, but
memory that is running on a front-side bus at a speed for which it
was not designed. --And many board-vendors don't know the difference.
As a temporary 'fix', if your BIOS or board pin-headers provide a
100 MHz setting for the memory-bus, set it and see if it works.
