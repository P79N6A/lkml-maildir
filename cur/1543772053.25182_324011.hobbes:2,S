Some PPC does support MSI.  For example the PCI-X host bridge inside
the IBM (now AMCC) PPC 440GP supports MSI.  I don't know if any
non-embedded PPC or PPC64 supports MSI though -- for example do any
IBM POWER-based systems support MSI??
The current code isn't exactly x86-specific.  It's more Intel APIC
specific, which means that chipsets that for some reason or another
support the same address/message format will work.  So ia64 works as
well.  Following from that, HP parisc boxes that use the same chipset
as HP ia64 boxes have a chance at working.
But the PPC 440GP uses a different address and a different message
format.  So if anyone cared about supporting that, the current code
would have to be made more generic.
