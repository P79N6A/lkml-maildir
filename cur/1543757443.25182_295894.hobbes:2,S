This isn't true unfortunately, a lot of information is lost in cvs.  file
deletes, renames etc..   Plus, the implementation from Bitkeeper is

Yeah,  I didn't mean to suggest that it be opened up to the public :o) 
Just that the flow of information wouldn't all have to originate in bk to
make it into head (ie. bk could pull changes from head too).
