When running a Sagem 800 DSL modem (eagle adiusbadsl drivers from
http://eagle-usb.fr.st/
) I've run into following problem. When sending
lots of data through the DSL link, an USB error appears, modem device is
disconnected, and then reconnected. The kernel.log says:
Jan 17 21:44:02 osama kernel: usb-uhci.c: interrupt, status 3, frame# 952
Jan 17 21:44:02 osama kernel: [Adi] transmit error with URB status -110
Jan 17 21:44:02 osama kernel: [Adi] transmit error with URB status -110

Jan 17 21:44:02 osama kernel: [ADI] adi_irq : URB status indicates error (-84)
Jan 17 21:44:02 osama kernel: hub.c: already running port 2 disabled by hub (EMI?), re-enabling...
Jan 17 21:44:02 osama kernel: usb.c: USB disconnect on device 00:07.2-2 address 61
Jan 17 21:44:02 osama kernel: [adi] adi_irq : URB canceled by user.
Jan 17 21:44:02 osama kernel: [adi] ADSL device removed
Jan 17 21:44:02 osama kernel: hub.c: new USB device 00:07.2-2, assigned address 62
Sometimes it's "interrupt, status 2", frame# is always different.
The motherboard is using a VIA Apollo VPX chipset, names from /proc/pci:
Host bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C585VP [Apollo VP1/VPX] (rev 35).
ISA bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C586/A/B PCI-to-ISA [Apollo VP] (rev 65).
IDE interface: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C586B PIPC Bus Master IDE (rev 6).
USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. USB (rev 2).
Non-VGA unclassified device: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C586B ACPI (rev 16).
My kernel is vanilla 2.4.21 with grsecurity patches.
The problem is pretty similar to one already reported on LKML: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/12/19/173.
 That problem was triggered by
writes to USB disk, also plugged to VIA Apollo USB controller. Because
of that I think, that my problem isn't in DSL modem drivers.
What can I do to solve this problem? Thanks.
