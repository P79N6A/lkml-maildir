Actually, I think we need to know why this is happening, since the use
of these sequence locks is growing.  On voyager I just put it down to HZ
== 1000 being a bit much for my old pentium 66MHz processors, but if
you've seen it on a much faster processor, that would tend to indicate
there's some other problem at work here.
