That's true, but at some point in the future I think the work involved
in making sure all new additional kernel code and all new intra-kernel
interactions are "tuned" becomes larger than going preemptive all the
way down.
Apple had its arguments for cooperative, along the same lines as what
you've mentioned I believe.  And while I agree that the kernel is a much
_more_ trusted environment, I think the possibilities easily remain for
abuse given that there are A) more and more people contributing kernel
code every day, and B) countless unspeakably evil modules out there.
And the preempt tunability that has been mentioned sounds like it would
go a long way.

It sounds like the LL patches are easier and less prone to locking
issues with a lot of the benefit.  But I can't help but feel that it's
not using the right tool for the job.  I think the end result of
stabilizing a preemptive kernel (in 2.5?) is worth the price, IMHO.
