Another oddity -- I notice things taking alot more memory
in 2.4.  This coincides with 'top' consistently showing I have 0 shared
memory.  These two observations would have me wondering if I
have somehow misconfigured my system to disallow sharing.  Note
that /proc/meminfo also shows 0 shared memory:
        total:    used:    free:  shared: buffers:  cached:

Not that it seems unrelated, but I do have filesystem type shm 
mounted on /dev/shm as suggested for POSIX shared memory.
