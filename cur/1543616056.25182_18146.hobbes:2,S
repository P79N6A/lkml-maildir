Can you elaborate a little more? What do the buffer underflow sound 
like, does it stop playing (silence) for a very short period and then 
start again, or does it write ahead too far and overrite data that's 
currently playing, causing garbled or repeated sound? Your email to me 
describing this scenario left me a little confused.
The former would indicate simple scheduling latency--nothing that can be 
done about that--and the latter might be a problem with i810_update_ptr 
or get_free_write_space in your implementation. I haven't looked at your 
code too much yet...
I assume you're using xmms with artsd. What is your artsd fragment size? 
(Click on kde control center, go to sound/sound server/sound i/o)
I assume you're using the artsd default of 4096, which is larger than 
the actual hardware chunk size of 2048. If your problem is nothing more 
than latency-induced underruns, perhaps it would make more sense to use 
MIN(userfragsize, fragsize) to determine the return status for 
i810_poll. Doug, do you have any thoughts?
A buffer overrun is not the same as an underflow, even when we're 
talking about a ring buffer ;)

Some sort of fix in the drain_dac area is probably needed for the real 
Intel chips too; with 0.13 I was seeing a drain_dac: dma_timeout printk 
occasionally on my setup which I hadn't bothered to debug yet. Didn't 
hurt the machine and I figured it was maybe just dropped or latent 
interrupts, so I got lazy. ;)

Does this solve a problem for your SiS chip? i810_write seemed to be 
working fine on my setup. (Intel hardware.)
