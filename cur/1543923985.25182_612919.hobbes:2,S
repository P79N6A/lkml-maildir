Hi Sam,
I have daily/nightly builds + test runs that use something like:
(but more complicated than this)
cp saved.config.file arch/$ARCH/config.default
EXPORT KBUILD_DEFCONFIG=config.default
make defconfig
This stopped working in 2.6.24-rc1-git3.  git2 worked as (I) expected.
Is there anything in the Makefile changes around that time
that could have caused this?
Note: the make defconfig output has changed from
Default configuration is based on config.default
to
*** Default configuration is based on 'x86_64_defconfig'
If not, I'll dig deeper into my script files.
Thanks,
---
~Randy
