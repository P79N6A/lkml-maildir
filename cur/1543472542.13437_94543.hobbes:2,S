Hi,
    I seem to be having problems playing mp3s in Linux on a alpha
(multia). I'm using rh 5.1 (w/errata patches) and kernel 2.0.35. I
couldn't get stock 2.0.35 to compile properly, so I applied patches for
2.0.35 that I found at
ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/Digital/Linux-Alpha/Kernels/.
After applying those patches, 2.0.35 compiled fine. I haven't been able
to compile 2.0.36 (stock, or patched from 2.0.35+dec_patches).
I get floating point exceptions on attempting to run any mp3 player
  [root@alpha freeamp]# ./freeamp /greenday-time_of_your_life.mp3
  Floating point exception
  [root@alpha freeamp]#
[root@alpha amp-0.7.6]# ./amp /04-pretty_fly.mp3

The following kernel messages popup also:

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
