We (the -stable team) are announcing the release of the 2.6.18.4 kernel.
This has just a single security fix (CVE-2006-5751) for the network
bridge code in it.  An unprivileged local user could potentially write
to kernel memory without this fix.
The diffstat and short summary of the fixes are below.
I'll also be replying to this message with a copy of the patch between
2.6.18.3 and 2.6.18.4, as it is small enough to do so.
The updated 2.6.18.y git tree can be found at:                                  
        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.18.y.git 
and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser:                    
        www.kernel.org/git/                                                     
thanks,
-chris
