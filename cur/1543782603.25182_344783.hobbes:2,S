Traditional unix namespace is a sequence of bytes with '/' as a
seperator and \0 as a terminator. There are no other restrictions. UTF-8

If you follow the thread further various people pointed out that POSIX
and other standard documents are actually more restrictive in their
guarantees so my belief by a strict standards reading is wrong. It'll
break a few apps if you enforced it (lots if you took the minimal posix
requirement).
