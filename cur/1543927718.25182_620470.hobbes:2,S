I tried to add nolapic_timer manually, and that helped, but:
checking TSC synchronization [CPU#0 -> CPU#1]:
Measured 627605 cycles TSC warp between CPUs, turning off TSC clock.
Marking TSC unstable due to: check_tsc_sync_source failed.
Brought up 2 CPUs
CPU0 attaching sched-domain:
 domain 0: span 3
  groups: 1 2
CPU1 attaching sched-domain:
 domain 0: span 3
  groups: 2 1
net_namespace: 64 bytes
...
Bluetooth: HCI socket layer initialized
ACPI: RTC can wake from S4
Time: hpet clocksource has been installed.
Clockevents: could not switch to one-shot mode:<6>Clockevents: could
not switch to one-shot mode: lapic is not functional.
Could not switch to high resolution mode on CPU 1
 lapic is not functional.
Could not switch to high resolution mode on CPU 0
system 00:00: iomem range 0x0-0x9ffff could not be reserved
...and result is nohz is not functional :-(.
