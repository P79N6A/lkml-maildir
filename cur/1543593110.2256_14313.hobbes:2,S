Hi folks!
When I lstat64 a directory on an nfs mount the answer to GETATTR is
received by the network interface but dropped (not seen by the client)
afterwards. Only 50musec after the receive of the answer an
icmp-destination-unreachable (port-unreachable) goes out to the server.
This is annoying since it blocks all access to that directory.
The request in question is sent and received at port 772.
I'm using kernel 2.4.4.
Please help,
					Roland
