Subject: List of proprietary kernel modules?

Can anyone direct me to where I might find a maintained list of binary
only kernel modules?
Best I've been able to find was a post to the list by Arjan van de Ven
in Sep 2001 where he lists 26 different modules.
Alternatively, if you know of any binary-only kernel modules, please
add them to this list:
  
http://developer.osdl.org/dev/opendrivers/wiki/index.php/Binary_Kernel_Modules_List
and the community will maintain it in future.
