Nor does it work on SPARC-like processors (it tries, but the resulting
programs dump core).

Probably a rewrite (using trees instead of RTL) would be easier;
preferably by someone who actually documents what the patch is doing and
submits it in a fashion acceptable to the GCC people; i.e. not in a
single huge nearly-unexplained lump followed by all queries going
unanswered.
Working directly on trees would have the advantage that it would work on
every platform GCC supports straight away (or at least it would have a
higher chance of doing so).
