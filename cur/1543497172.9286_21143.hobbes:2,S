Last I heard, the ttyS* devices had to be opened O_NONBLOCK for callout. This
is impossible to do from a shell script (e.g. ppp-on). So the cua* devices
are still useful to people who don't want to rewrite their dialup scripts.
(And yes, I use a /dev/modem symlink too. Change one symlink instead of
reconfiguring $BIGNUM different programs)
