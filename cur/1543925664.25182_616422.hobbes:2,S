The sad part here is that the 32-bit kernel doesn't seem to have this 
problem at all, and has it fixed thanks to just having cleaner 
abstractions (eg the "unlazy_fpu()" function will just automatically clear 
TS_USEDFPU as part of __save_init_fpu()).
In comparison, the x86-64 math handling is a total friggin mess. Maybe 
it's not *beautiful* in the 32-bit path either, but most of the complexity 
in the 32-bit stuff is due to just the complexity of interactions. In the 
64-bit code, the complexity seems to come largely from just being crap, 
crap, crap.
The *real* fix for this is almost certainly to just get rid of the 64-bit 
code entirely, and use the 32-bit code as the base for one single unified 
setup. The 32-bit code should be largely a superset of the 64-bit code 
anyway, since it has to handle more cases, and does it more cleanly.
Oh, well. Your patch looks good for now.
Btw: the 64-bit code looks like it might have preemption issues too. 
Another bug that seems to be fixed in the 32-bit codepath.
Anybody willing to try to do that unification around the 32-bit code? The 
biggest issue with the 64-bit code is to avoid the extra rex prefix for 
"fxsave", which means that the fxsave/fxrstor thing is done with
	"rex64/fxsave %P2(%1)"
		: "m" (tsk->thread.i387.fxsave)
		: "cdaSDb" (tsk),
		  "i" (offsetof(__typeof__(*tsk), thread.i387.fxsave)));
which isn't exactly pretty, but the memory address generation works fine 
in 32-bit code too, and the rex override is easily done with
	#ifdef CONFIG_X86_64
	  #define REX64 "rex64/"
	#else
	  #define REX64 ""
	#endif
and then you just use
	REX64 "fxsave"
in the asm statements instead.
So I'll apply this patch for 2.6.24, but considering that it really looks 
like x86-64 is preempt-broken too, if somebody does a larger patch that 
does the above merge and tests it, I would be open to apply that too. It 
does seem to be a real bug (having a scheduling event in the signal path 
between the actual fxsave and the clearing of the bits would *seem* to 
possibly screw up the FP state!)
But maybe I'm missing some reason why it doesn't matter. The 32-bit code 
was fixed back in 2003 (commit 5bff44fc272b948a85e893a007d01b9dfb3ad04f 
"Be a lot more careful about TS_USEDFPU and preemption" in the historical 
tree with a comment like this:
    We had some races where we tested (or set) TS_USEDFPU together
    with sequences that depended on the setting (like clearing or
    setting the TS flag in %cr0) and we could be preempted in between,
    which screws up the FPU state, since preemption will itself change
    USEDFPU and the TS flag.
and maybe it's just the 32-bit tree being unnecessarily careful. It's long 
enough ago that I don't remember the details, but I have a dim memory of 
there actually being some state corruption involved.
