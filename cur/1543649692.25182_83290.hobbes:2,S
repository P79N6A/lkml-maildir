There is no way somebody can help you with "Recently I wrote a file-
system...." We don't have your source-code and we don't even know if
you know how to write a file-system. However, the -
  Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address fffffffc 
- is a good hint that some pointer isn't initialized correctly under
all the conditions occurring during the mount.
