Here is a config file and a 41 lines shell script, that
will populate /udev with all devices found via /sys.
A version to add or remove only one file should be about
the same size.
---cat /etc/makedev.conf---
ttyS0 root dialout 0660
zero root root 0666
null root root 0666
---cat makedev---
#!/bin/sh
set -e
DEV=/udev
CONFIG=/etc/makedev.conf
cd $DEV
find /sys/class -name dev |while read A;
do
	B=`dirname $A`
	B=`basename $B`
	MM=`cat $A|tr ":" " "`
	mknod --mode=0600 $B c $MM
	if grep -q "$B " $CONFIG
	then
		USER=`grep "$B " $CONFIG|cut -d" " -f2`
		GROUP=`grep "$B " $CONFIG|cut -d" " -f3`
		MODE=`grep "$B " $CONFIG|cut -d" " -f4`
		chown $USER.$GROUP $B
		chmod $MODE $B
	fi
done
find /sys/block -name dev |while read A;
do
	B=`dirname $A`
	B=`basename $B`
	MM=`cat $A|tr ":" " "`
	mknod --mode=0600 $B b $MM
	if grep -q "$B " $CONFIG
	then
		USER=`grep "$B " $CONFIG|cut -d" " -f2`
		GROUP=`grep "$B " $CONFIG|cut -d" " -f3`
		MODE=`grep "$B " $CONFIG|cut -d" " -f4`
		chown $USER.$GROUP $B
		chmod $MODE $B
	fi
done
---cut---
So udev is 99% overhead?
sure, it's fast and small, and has lots of features that I don't need.

bloat. lots of bloat. what is that tdb database for?
filesystems are persistent. if you want to save space,
create a tar file :-)

I agree. lines of codes is a horrible metric, and comparing a shell
script that uses many external commands to a c application with
everything build is makes absolutely no sense. but I wonder why
the off the shelf machine needs a c applications, if all those
external commands are installed anyway.
