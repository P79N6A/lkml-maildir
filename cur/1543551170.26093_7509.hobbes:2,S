Oops... looks like I was too quick to cry success... It does NOT work, even
with the patch. I tried it again and again, and could not get it to boot. I
probably put a wrong (Pentium MMX) kernel on the flashdisk when I first tested
your patch, which led me to believe it did, indeed, work. After repeated
experiments I can only conclude thay Winchip2A is still hosed, even when
reverse-applying the patch Dave sent. I'll try to find out where it stops using
the DISPLAY_.. trick...
Cheers//Frank
