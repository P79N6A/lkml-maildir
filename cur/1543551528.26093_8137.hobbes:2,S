I encountered this same problem with the Appletalk module a couple days
ago.
I compiled my kernel (2.2.17) with Appletalk disabled, then realized that
I needed it so I built it as a module.  But it wouldn't load because it
required register_snap_client() and unregister_snap_client().
Rebuilding my kernel solved the problem, but it took a little digging
through Makefiles to figure out what was actually going on
