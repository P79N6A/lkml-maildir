That sucks. You might as well just crash in that case.

No, that won't work over NFS. It won't work with tar, cpio...

The whole ext3 idea is stupid. Why bother with yet another UFS-like
filesystem? We have one, it works well, it is extendible enough, and
it will last us until we get something like XFS or AdvFs. (Reiserfs)
With hindsight, I could lay out the inode better. Who cares though?
The existing one works well enough.
The name itself is bad. When we had both "ext" and "ext2", people
would try to use "ext" to mount "ext2" partitions. It didn't work
of course.

There is no need for ext3.
Larger data types are trivial, since the space is already reserved.
Ext2 isn't a stupid filesystem in need of vfat-like hacks. Even the
more difficult ACLs can be supported, although userspace will often
screw up with them.
Capabilities could be supported in ext2, but they would be a waste
of inode space and source of major app & protocol incompatibility.
We can do just fine with capability information embedded in the executable.
Compatibility is critical.
I'm still waiting for a filesystem-based proposal that works with NFS.
