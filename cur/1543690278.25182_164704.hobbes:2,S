I was afraid you were getting at something like that. I've been
developing this on UP and the drivers I've been playing with aren't
too chatty so nothing's shown up. 
And no, I don't think there's much that can be done to fix it, short
of putting in deadlock avoidance of some sort or auditing drivers. We
run a risk of infinite recursion if we manage to avoid the deadlock
anyway.
My current plan is to hope that such printks are rare except in
network driver development, in which case using netconsole or kgdb-o-e
is asking for trouble anyway.
