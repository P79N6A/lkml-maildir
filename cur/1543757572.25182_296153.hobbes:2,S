It is pretty stable indeed, I haven't had any major bug reports for 
quite some time now. It's probably as ready as it's ever going to be.
So the question is: what should I do with it? Who do I send it to?
Also, if anyone has comments about the code, bug reports, etc. - feel
free to contact me. If there are any issues remaining, I'd like to fix
them ASAP.
Live long and prosper.
