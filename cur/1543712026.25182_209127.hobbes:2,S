I will look into this code. At this point of time, I have another question.
Say an application calls read on the device and the data to be read is not
present in buffer cache. This should cause "request function" to be called
(read is waiting for completion). If request function hands over this to
some thread (which will perform actual read later) and returns, then what
happens to the read called in application (which was blocking). Because by
the time read in application returns, it should have read data. I am very
confused about this. Could someone shed some light on this?
