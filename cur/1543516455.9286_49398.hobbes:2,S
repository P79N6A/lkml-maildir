Very true, but at least it's not something that nobody is interested
in. That would give me pause to think...

OK, here's what I would like to see this end up with:
 1. Any number of partitions can be mounted on top of each other,
    with all files in all partitions visible.
 2. There can be any mixture of R/O and R/W partitions, with no
    limit on the number of each.
 3. Where a program attempts to modify an existing file found on
    a R/W partition, it is directly modified on whichever of the
    partitions it is currently on.
 4. Where a program attempts to create a new file, it is created
    on a designated read-write partition from those available.
 5. The designated partition can be different for different users.
Note that I very specifically have NOT dealt with the problem of what
to do when a program attempts to modify an existing file on a R/O
partition. I can see valid arguments for both of the following
viewpoints:
 6. Elsewhere, R/O partitions do not permit files to be modified
    in any way, so why should it be different here.
 7. Why can't I boot from a CD with a hard drive mounted over it,
    and have the modifications made on the hard drive.
I believe this problem will prove to require a separate mount option
to allow users to specify which behaviour they require, and for this
reason, the ONLY decision I would make wwould be to specify that (6)
would be the default, with (7) chosen only if the other option is also
specified at mount time. See later...

Personally, I do not believe there is any sense in discussing the
above until some sort of initial implementation exists to enable the
feasibility of most of the above to be determined in practice rather
than theoretically. Too much of it could easily be wishful thinking.

Unfortunately, I can't see any easy solution to the problem of name
clashes for non-directories, although a reasonable solution for name
clashes involving only directories would be to treat the directory in
question as a separate transparent mount.

Good.

Other than for dealing with name clashes involving non-directory
entries, this shouldn't be a problem.

Same here.

Additionally:
     4. mount -o ro,trans,cow     /dev/hda7  /mnt
        Mount a second or later partition transparently on top of
        the existing ones, also mounted read-only, but specify
        that if any files on this partition are modified, they are
        to be copied to whatever is the current read-write mount
        in this stack.
        Note that "cow" = "copy on write" as per Linux standards.

Good.
