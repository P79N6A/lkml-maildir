Hmmm...  ARM has two implementations.  One in the header files which is what I
consulted when writing that email:
static inline void ____atomic_set_bit(unsigned int bit, volatile unsigned long *p)
{
	unsigned long flags;
	unsigned long mask = 1UL << (bit & 31);
	p += bit >> 5;
	raw_local_irq_save(flags);
	*p |= mask;
	raw_local_irq_restore(flags);
}
And the other in the libs which does as you say.  Why the one in the header
file at all?
