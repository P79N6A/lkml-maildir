As previously explained, user mounts are only allowed on directories
for which the user has full write access.  Exactly for this reason.

Huh?  Where did modularitly come into this?

The point of this thread is to find a solution to a problem.  The
discussion is turning up very interesting viewpoints and I'm
understanding the problem better and better, and I think other people
are too.
While I disagree with the view taken by Christoph H., I'm now also
thankful to him for stiring up the mud, because it ended up with a lot
of useful ideas.
In the end I'd like a solution that everybody is happy with.  That
means I'm not going to give up searching because someone said, that
the current solution is crappy.
Do you understand my position?

Yes.  I'm not going to ask Andrew to merge the code until I feel that
everybody concerned is happy with it.  No matter how many release
cycles it takes.

It has been distributed separately from the kernel for 3 years now.
So people _can_ try it out.
Thanks,
