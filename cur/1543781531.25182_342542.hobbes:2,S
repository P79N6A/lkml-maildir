I'm still pointing towards that assign pci resources patch from Gregs
tree that I mentioned earlier..
the fact that disabling the DRM stops things from working is really
bad, maybe the pci_enable_device in the DRM is setting up the devices,
whereas  without it X tries and fails...

I'm running low on ideas, I'm also having a hard time tracking what is
actually happening,  the MGA bugs I've tracked are related to that
assign pci resources patch, and I really can't see what is happening
if the DRM isn't in the mix..
If you build a working kernel (i.e. like 2.6.13 without DRM) does it
hang similarly?
Dave.
