I told you: the GPL does not preclude inter-operation with non-GPL software.

Copyright-holders' opinions mean nothing.  In the particular case of
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL, copyright-holders' opinions are clearly flawed
because they make a statement about code that they do not even know of. 
It's equivalent to someone saying, "you are wrong," before you've even
thought about saying something.

How ludicrous.  That's as much a nonsense as EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL.  You
have no idea what my political goals are.
Less there be further confusion: I am not an advocate for binary
drivers.  That role is reserved for others.  However that does not stop
me from criticising something that is obviously wrong.  Stating that
only a GPL code is permitted to use a symbol contravenes the GPL,
because the GPL states no such requirement.  Saying that it's impossible
for code that uses the symbol to be non-GPL (as has been claimed) is a
lie at worst, and a hope at best.  Nobody claiming such a thing could
know it to be true.  (It is not true.)
