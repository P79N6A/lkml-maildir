Gerard,
I was not spending a lot of time with this right now becuase I was trying to
get FENRIS tested on as much hardware as possible prior to dumping the code
to our FTP server, but I will have some time tommorow to look at this in
more depth if this would be helpful after I put the tarball up on our ftp
server.  What do you want me to look at next?
Jeff
