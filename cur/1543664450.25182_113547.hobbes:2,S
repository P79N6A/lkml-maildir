I need the magic incantation for oprofile for these then ...
Actually, better still, we need a wrapper script that works out this
from /proc/cpuinfo and auto-sets it up for you, if someone who knows
enough about different Pentium types knows how ... I'm happy to go
write it if it's easy to detect ...
My laptop says: 
model name      : Pentium III (Coppermine)
but a list of pattern matches from someone (or list of people) who
know how this works would be very helpful (ie matching up cpuinfo
to magic incantation to oprofile).
