	The idea being that devfs and /dev (on the disk) are one and the same
and the kernel is happily off making changes to files on the disk when a device
is added or removed?  That and devfs catches the 'open' call to determine what
device to talk to?
	Hmm.  It sounds almost like you're coming up w/ a layer between the
filesystem and the kernel to support this idea.  Or perhaps the layer is
between the user-space proggie and the kernel (Assuming the kernel is above the
filesystem...).
	Thinking about it.
