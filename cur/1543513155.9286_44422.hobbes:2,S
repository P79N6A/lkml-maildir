AFAI can make out, it locks up just after bringing up eth0, which is a
module on my system. The fsck following the next boot finds that module.conf
had a zero d_time (I think), so I suspect it was being read at the time of
the crash.
The screen looks really weird afterward, reminding me of ZX Spectrum crashes
in the old days :-)
I also noted that I had trouble removing a public ARP entry, inserted by:
	/sbin/arp -s 10.0.0.123 -D eth0 -i eth0 pub
Removing with
	/sbin/arp -d 10.0.0.123
Gives 'no such file'. This under 2.3.21, I have not investigated this
further.
Regards,
bert hubert.
