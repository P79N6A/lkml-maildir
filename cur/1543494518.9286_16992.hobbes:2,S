We use DLT4000 for large backups. No problem at all.
One month ago I ask for some experience feedback when using DLT7000.
Marc Schaefer schaefer@alphanet.ch told me there is no incompatibility
with this device.
About controllers we use BusLogic Flash boards.
No experience with BRU.
Should you need more information, feel free.
