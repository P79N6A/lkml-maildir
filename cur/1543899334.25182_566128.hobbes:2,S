Right.  Nice way to slow down or stop the suspend with an unprivileged
process.  Avoiding that sort of DoS is one of the design goals of
fuse.
Look at it this way: the task of the freezer is to stop new I/O
hitting the hardware.  But it is totally indiscriminate about what it
stops, it tries to stop _everything_ even things which have nothing to
do with hardware.
Not nice.
