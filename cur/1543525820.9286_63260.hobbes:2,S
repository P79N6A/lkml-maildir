If you had a memory architecture where each sibling has local memory, with 
it's other siblings local mappable into it's address space, it could probe by 
doing memory detection for each possible sibling.
Initial kernel boot could copy it's image to local memory at each sibling, 
fill in a "start up data area", and use whatever hardware mechanism to call 
the main entry point for the initial processor at each sibling.  The start up 
data area would have any info needed to boot, i.e. maybe a node number and 
hardware list.  After this, the "initial" kernel would set up it's own start 
up data area, and call it's main kernel entry point.
So this would really be bootstrapping code, and kernel entry and setup 
wouldn't really be affected.  This would be pretty clean, but I'm assuming a 
specialized architecture that helps you quite a bit here.
To do it on generic SMP, you could partition system memory into N segments, 
copy the kernel image to each segment, and call the particular entry point on 
each sibling.  (Each sibling would have a different physical memory entry 
point and would need the ability to boot from any specified physical memory 
address).
If you can only boot from a fixed physical address, you need to play more 
games.  You have all siblings but the master re-map their portion of physical 
memory to "local" (a fixed address), wait for the masters command (when it 
finishes probing hardware are dividing memory).  Then they can all jump to 
their local entry point, and they all have a uniform memory structure.
Of course with generic SMP, you have a pretty major problem trying to share a 
peripheral bus between isolated kernels, unless you divy up hardware between 
siblings.  When you did this, you put more intelligence behind interrupt 
routing.  However, each sibling would need it's own disk/network, unless your 
sibling communication protocol provides sharing of those resources.
You wouldn't need a communication protocol as heavy as TCP, I would expect 
data loss/corruption to be dealt with in hardware for whatever communication 
method you are using (likely shared memory).
  VM layout of physical memory mapping for each sibling (this changes a bit 
depending on architecture).
|----------------------|
| Sibling i+3 (mod 4)  | 
|   physical memory    |
|----------------------|
| Sibling i+2 (mod 4)  |
|   physical memory    |
|----------------------|
| Sibling i+1 (mod 4)  |
|   physical memory    |
|----------------------|
| Local (Sibling i)    |
|   physical memory    |
|----------------------|
The only part of the kernel that needs to be aware of the different sibling 
physical mappings is the communication layer itself, so that wouldn't pose to 
great of a problem to the kernel.
Some of the things you might want to do with the communication protocol:
cross-sibling UNIX domain sockets/shm
FS sharing
Hardware arbitration/sharing
borrow/return free pages
I think it is feasible to do something like this with the current Linux base.  
The bootstrapping/VM initialization will need some major overhaul, but I don't 
think the main kernel startup will be affected too drastically.
Just some food for thought.
