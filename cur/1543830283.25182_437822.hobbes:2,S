I'm not.  Not any more.  After much fruitless rummaging, I did some more
profiling to verify the numbers.  It really does take that much more cpu
when booted with noapic, nearly 50%!  I've been chasing swamp gas.
Oh well.  I got a warm fuzzy wrt tools cpu usage numbers out of it.
Stick a fork in this bug, it's done ;-)
