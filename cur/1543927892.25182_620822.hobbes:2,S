ok, great. I cannot test the revert because i only run distro kernels on 
this box so i can only confirm that the bug is gone once your revert is 
upstream and DaveJ has built a new Fedora kernel for it (which is 1-2 
days after the commit goes upstream). So consider it fixed once you do 
the revert and i'll re-report it if i see any similar assert on a kernel 
that has this commit reverted.
