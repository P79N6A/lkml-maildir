No, it's not an only logo issue. Bit reversals happen for all images
which are passed to slow_imageblit() including all fonts.
Can it be a 'bit_per_pixel = 1' issue ? It seems that this config has
not been widely tested.
If you look at slow_imageblit() current implementation and for example
let's say that at the begining of the function we have:
	- __LITTLE_ENDIAN is defined
	- bpp = 1
	- fgcolor = 1
	- bgcolor = 0
	- start_index = 0
The function core can be simplified into:
	for (i = image->height; i--; ) {
		shift = val = 0;
		l = 8;
		j = image->width;
		dst = (u32 __iomem *) dst1;
		s = src;
		while (j--) {
			l--;
			color = (*s & (1 << l)) ? 1 : 0;
			val |= color << shift;
			
			/* Did the bitshift spill bits to the next long? */
			if (shift >= null_bits) {
				FB_WRITEL(val, dst++);
				val = (shift == null_bits) ? 0 :
					FB_SHIFT_LOW(color,32 - shift);
			}
			shift += 1;
			shift &= (32 - 1);
			if (!l) { l = 8; s++; };
		}
		[ ...]
Doesn't this bit of code do a bit reversal ? Specially these 2
following lines of code:
	color = (*s & (1 << l)) ? 1 : 0;
	val |= color << shift;
with 'l' taking values from 7 to 0, and 'shift' taking values from 0
to 31.
Thanks
