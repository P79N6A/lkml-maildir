the patch is designed for applications that manage their own data cache,
like databases do.  but it is also useful for applications that want to
move large datasets without blowing the O/S level data cache.
in the NFS case, because O_DIRECT read() and write() always go back to the
server, you can more easily build clustered and HA applications that share
the data storage backend.
