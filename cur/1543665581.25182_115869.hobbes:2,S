2.5.64-mm1 on K6/2 uniprocessor completed the 24 hour benchmarks
using anticipatory scheduler with no oops.  (Badness in request_irq 
at arch/i386/kernel/irq.c:475 is known and non-fatal).
2.5.64-mm1 had ~ 47% improvement in tiobench sequential read 
throughput on ext2, compared to 2.5.64 on uniprocessor K6/2.
2.5.64-mm2 ran dbench, Linux Test Project, unixbench, lmbench
with no problems on uniprocessor too.
2.5.64-mm4 is running on Quad Xeon now, and has finished dbench
runs with no oops.
