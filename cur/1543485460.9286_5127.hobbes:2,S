  Hi, all. From time to time I see questions on this list about what's
changed in the kernel API interface from 2.0 to 2.2. I've started
writing a document about this which I hope will be of some help to
driver writers and others.
Check out: 
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/
 and go to the
documentation link. Alternatively, the FAQ mentioned at the bottom
each and every message on linux-kernel also has a link to this page.
Please, people: if you have a question, please check the FAQ first. We
keep seeing lots and lots of questions that are answered in the
FAQ. The same questions keep getting asked over and over again, which
is a real shame since the FAQ is there to avoid that.
The FAQ *is* being maintained (it wasn't for a while, but we've fixed
that now). Contributions are welcome. Furthermore, if you have a
question that isn't answered in the FAQ, try asking one of the FAQ
maintainers or contributers instead of posting to the list. It will
save traffic on the list and gives you a better chance of being
answered (speaking personally I ignore most questions posted to the
list: I don't have the time).
				Regards,
					Richard....
