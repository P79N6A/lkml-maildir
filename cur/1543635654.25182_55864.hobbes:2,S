Yes, I know, and I also know that one can make many foolish arguments in
the name of consistency, but this doesn't change the fact that bz2bzImage
is one of the ugliest symbols we've yet seen, and much worse, it's one
that normal, unsuspecting users are going to come in contact with, if
this code gets into the kernel.
So I'm suggesting it's time to break with tradition try for something a
little less offensive to the eyes.

"A bit" doesn't begin to describe it.

Exactly, which is why I didn't suggest it.

There is nothing standard about this name, it exists in exactly one place:
the Linux build process.

You are, it's your patch.  And I've taken upon myself the responsibility
of heaving the decaying vegetables deserved by your first attempt.
Actually, what is the use of even including 'bz2' in the name?  Nobody
besides we geeks needs to know the thing is compressed with bzip2.  It
would be nice to see the word 'linux' in there.  How about bzlinux?
Just think of the hundreds of cases of carpal tunnel syndrome you'd
prevent by eliminating the shifted character.
