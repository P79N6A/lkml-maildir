Before configuring the kernel (IE doing make xconfig or make menuconfig, or
just editing .config) do a make oldconfig. That will load the defaults in
all parts, otherwise I'd suggest reading the help that's included with the
given options in the configuration program (IE hit ? in make menuconfig or
click on the *fuzzy memory* help button in make xconfig).
Hope that helps
