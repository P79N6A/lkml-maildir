Furthermore, short writes work just fine.  The errors usually start
happening after about 100 MB at full speed.  When copying from NFS
over a 100 MB/s network it usually goes a little longer, sometimes
even up to 500 MB.  All this could indicate that there is some error
in the timing, and that it takes some time for it build up enough to
trigger the bad things.  Or am I wrong?
Why can't the drive give notice when it's ready to accept more data?
That would seem like the simple solution, instead of trying to
synchronize the timers.
