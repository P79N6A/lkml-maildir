Hi,
On my system, in /proc/bus/pci, there are two directories, "00" and "01",
I assume these represent the first and second PCI busses on my system.  
My question is, what do the files in these directories do?
Also, a possibly related question:  Is there any way to get the
pci_devices dev->class field from userspace?  I notice that the new
/proc/bus/pci/devices file has a lot of information, but doesn't include
the class type (e.g. Storage, Video).  I see that this information is
present in /proc/pci, but my understanding is that /proc/pci is
obsolete.  Any easy way to get this information?
Thanks,
Steven
