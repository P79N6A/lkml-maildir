I don't see why that special case for cpusets is needed.
I'm suggesting making no special cases for CPUSETS at all, until and
unless we find reason to.
In other words, I'm suggesting simply removing the patch lines:
-	depends on SWAP
+	depends on SWAP && !CPUSETS
I see no other mention of cpusets in your patch.  That's fine by me.
