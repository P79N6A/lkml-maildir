From someone who has no idea at all (yet) about 802.11: why character
device, and not sysfs or configfs files? Like
TASK: get list of MAC addresses available to hardware device (usually only one for current hw)
cat /sys/devices/path/to/device/wireless/address
TASK: get list of virtual devices including (some of) their properties
ls -l /sys/devices/path/to/device/wireless/
	...
	wlan0 -> /sys/class/net/wlan0
	wlan1 -> /sys/class/net/wlan1
TASK: create virtual device (with arbitrary type, netdev name and mac address)
						  ^^^^^^
					   isn't nameif / udev for that?
echo "$type" > /sys/devices/path/to/device/wireless/new_if
	... we get uevents for this new interface; in this we can set the
	mac adress doing:
echo "$mac" > /sys/class/net/wlan0/wireless/address
TASK: configure virtual device (key is the device name since that needs to be unique anyway) 
echo "$some_config_option_for_virtual_device" > /sys/class/net/wlan0/wireless/some_option
echo "$some_config_option_for_physical_device"> /sys/devices/path/to/dev/wireless/some_other_option
Of course the configuration userspace tool would use libsysfs for that, not
"echo" scripts... but they'd work too.
