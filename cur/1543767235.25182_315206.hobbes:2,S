I did test this patch on variety of systems and didn't see any failures.
Probably some other change in mm conflicting with this patch? 
Is there way to get the all the patches in mm, so that I can try same
Kernel and reproduce this failure?
I agree though that this patch is very risky and needs some discussion 
and lot of testing before it goes into base.
Thanks,
Venki
