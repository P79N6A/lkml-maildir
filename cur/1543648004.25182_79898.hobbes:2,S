Zone "type" can be found in (page->flags >> ZONE_SHIFT) & 0x3UL and
similarly node ID can be found in page_zone(page)->zone_pgdat->node_id
and these are from the page.
zone->zone_pgdat->node_id does the zone to node conversion
zone - zone_pgdat->node_zones does the zone to zone type conversion.
Node and zone type to flat zone number would be
	NODE_DATA(nid)->node_zones[type]
Basically there's a number written in page->flags that should be easy
to decode if you can go on arithmetic alone, and if you need details,
there's a zone_table[] you can get at the zones (and hence pgdats) with.
