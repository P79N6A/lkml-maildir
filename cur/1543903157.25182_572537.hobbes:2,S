You're missing the point.
Someone introduces an interface, which uses a structure:
struct foo {
	u32 bar;
	u64 baz;
	u32 quux;
};
Now, we want to port that to 64 bits.  We can either introduce a
thunking function to mangle the argument, or we can redefine the structure:
struct foo {
	u32 bar;
	compat_u64 baz;
	u32 quux;
};
... which is still ABI compatible on 32 bits, but doesn't require thunking.
Obviously, this is not a panacea; if the original "struct foo" has also
been introduced on 64 bits before the bug is caught, then you're screwed.
