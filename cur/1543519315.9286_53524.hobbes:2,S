I would usually ignore the nonsense like the above but you dared to 
mention my father by his holy name and thus I have to respond.
How dare you say rubbish like above on public? Red Hat Linux *is*
completely free, and being a market leader it only makes sense that its
shares go (and will continue infinitely) up in price. If you are unable to
download it or too poor to spend $1.95 to get it from CheapBytes, please
send me your snailmail address in private and I will send you a Red Hat
Linux 6.1 CD for free, wherever you are.
Comparing Red Hat with AOL is like comparing Red Hat with Microsoft or
with any other company based on proprietary technologies. Not nice, don't
do it again.
