Hi Theodore,
I disagree with your points and here is why. The
reason why is not because of registering/unregistering is done often but
rather implicit - because otherwise things like sys_sysfs() (and possibly
others) wouldn't need to take a big kernel lock (because underlying
routine fs_index() which manipulate file_systems would just take a read
lock).
So, what I was proposing would reduce the number of other things taking
big kernel lock and thus affecting yet other, completely unrelated to
file_systems things.
Regards,
