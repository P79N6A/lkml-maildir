Okay, so there is a case for OSS. Not sure who is maintaining it,
and if they care about making it act like ALSA. It would certainly
be nice to be consistent, and I'm sure that OSS users won't mind
getting rid of the occasional rude wakeup call.
(Oh, another nice scenario: if they ask you to turn on your
notebook at airport security. Great setting for demonstrating that
loud alarm-like feedback loop :-)
