first, some news
2.6.0-test11 makes same oops during second compilation of kernel. The vanilla kernel with PREEMPT always oops the same way. No matter, it's always reproductible.
2.6.0-test11 + Manfred's patch doesn't hang but I found a slab error in the logs that occured during a compilation. (I didn't find this for -test10, I was lucky ?)
So, there is no more way for my system to run a kernel > -test9 without problem.

Thanks for your explanation.
Should I try with L1 and/or L2 cache disable on my computer (I don't know if it's safe) ?
I trust my hardware but it's better to get some facts.

(between LFS/BLFS, kernel compilation and tests compilation, I will surely break kind of record about load average :-)
