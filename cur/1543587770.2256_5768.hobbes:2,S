just at first blush, there are some things in general but I need to read
this again and more closely....
but, with POSIX timers, there is a nifty little restriction/protection built
into the spec regarding the re-insertion of short interval repeating timers.
that is: a repeating timer will not be re-inserted until AFTER the
associated signal handler has been handled.
this has some interesting consequences for signal handling and signal
delivery implementations, but importantly, it ensures that even a flood of
POSIX timers with very short repeat intervals will be handled cleanly.
I will get more detailed comments to you tomorrow.
