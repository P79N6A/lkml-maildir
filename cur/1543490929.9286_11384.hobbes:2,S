Subject: bug in 2.2.3 net code for routing (ICMP redirects)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

   kernel: 2.2.3
    Sometime ICMP redirects are sent by a gateway when the gateway knows
there is
    a better route that can be used. There is 2 conditions for this
system to work:
    - the ICMP redirect must redirect to a gateway on the same subnet
    - When Masquerading or NAT is used, ICMP redirect should not be sent
    because of the different ip subnet.
    If we look at net/ipv4/route.c around line 1015 we see:
route.c:1015:
if (out_dev == in_dev && err && !(flags&RTCF_NAT) &&
(IN_DEV_SHARED_MEDIA(out_dev)
|| inet_addr_onlink(out_dev, saddr, FIB_RES_GW(res))))
    flags |= RTCF_DOREDIRECT;
    notice the !(flags&RTCF_NAT) .. this avoid ICMP redirects being sent
    for forwarded packets using NAT. But Masqueraded packets use the
    RTCF_MASQ flag... So ICMP redirects are sent.. If the sender accepts
    and follows the ICMP redirect, the connectivity to out-of-subnets
hosts will cease.
FIX:
1015: if (out_dev == in_dev && err && !(flags&RTCF_NAT) &&
!(flags&RTCF_MASQ) &&
    regards,
    Francois
