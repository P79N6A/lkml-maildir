  That's because 2.4.0-ac? supports new quota format which is incompatible
with the old one... You need also new utilities to manipulate with format
(I'm actually working with Marco to create utils which would support
both formats). You can download these utils at:
ftp://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/pub/local/jack/quota/utils/quota-3.00-4.tar.gz
Then read manpage of convertquota if you're interested.
