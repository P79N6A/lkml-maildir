Actually correct, but in terms of what can or does break, relatime seems 
a lot closer than noatime, I can't (personally) come up with any 
scenario where real applications would see something which would change 
behavior adversely.
Making noatime a default in the kernel requiring a boot option to 
restore current behavior seems to be a turn toward the "it doesn't 
really work right but it's *fast*" model. If vendors wanted noatime they 
are smart enough to enable it. Now with relatime giving most of the 
benefits and few (of any) of the side effects, I would expect a change.
By all means relatime by default in FC8, but not noatime, and let those 
who find some measurable benefit from noatime use it.
