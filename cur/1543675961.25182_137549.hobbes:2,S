I have two drives (WD Raptors) on my A7N8X. I don't see any errors, even 
after writing 9GB of data to the drive (after I've done an hdparm -X66 
-d1 /dev/hd[x]), but it still boots up in pio mode. 
Is there some silly hack I can do to the driver code to force all devices 
to DMA on bootup? Everything works fine except for that. I'm using 
2.4.21-rc6-ac1
Thanks!

This issue was reported by at least 3 People here on the list (including 
me) with different 21-rcX kernels. Seems noone really cared :-(
I hope, this issue now get's addressed.
btw. I could speed up my Transfer-Rate from 1.7MB/s to 55MB/s by setting
hdparm -d1 -X66 on my two native SATA-Drives.
bye
Marco
