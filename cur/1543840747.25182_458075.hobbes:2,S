Subject: Why Semaphore Hardware-Dependent?

Why can't we have a hardware-independent semaphore definition while we
have already had hardware-dependent spinlock, rwlock, and rcu lock? It
seems the semaphore definitions classified into two major categories.
The main deference is whether there is a member variable _sleeper_.
Does this (optional) member indicate any hardware family gene?
Best Regards.
