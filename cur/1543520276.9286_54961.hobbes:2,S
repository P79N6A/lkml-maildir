   However it still does not compile, mainly because
   asm-sparc/pgalloc.h is missing. Is this a case of "not yet
   finished" or did a patch drop out of the queue to the "lord of the
   penguin".
Sparc64 works perfectly fine, sparc32 is still in dire disrepair,
even in my tree which is equivalent to what Linus has right now.
It is hoped that sparc32 can be in working order by mid January
but no promises.
Later,
