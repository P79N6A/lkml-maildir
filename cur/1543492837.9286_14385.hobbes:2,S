I thought I probably was, thats why I looked at the 'Bridging' mini-howto
but I couldnt see whether it was possible or not to make it do
filtering/firewalling without having to make it the default router
as well. Its starting to look as though I cant, although one suggestion
so far is to use rarp. This may cause me some headaches - I have
800+ machines on my local side, and a huge number on the campus
side, although admittedly I dont need to know about most of them,
just mail hubs, web servers, news servers, time servers and dns servers.
Cheers,
Terry.
