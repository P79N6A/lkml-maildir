We're not.  I just grabbed a random line to show the non-atomic
accessors.  Any actual one we'd need to add would be:
#define __PageBuddy(page)         __test_bit(PG_buddy, &(page)->flags)
It looks like we don't have any of these non-atomic ones for plain
__PageFoo().  So, we'd have to add them for each one that we wanted.
Still not much work, and still satisfies the "grep test". :)
