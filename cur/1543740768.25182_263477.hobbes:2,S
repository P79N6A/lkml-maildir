Very good post, Helge. Excellent, if I might say.
Another important market to look into is laptops, IMO. 
Especially when memory consumption comes in, if the card can do 
"enough" 3D you could probably beat ATI and nVidia on the 
market.
(Of course, the definition of "enough" is quite subjective ... 
my 3D game is BZFlag, and for very complex maps at the max 
quality settings even my nVidia GeForce2 Go has its problems at 
1600x1200x32 ...)
