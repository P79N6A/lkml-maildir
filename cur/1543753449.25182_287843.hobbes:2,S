That sounds interesting, I'll check it out. Do you already have it
available somewhere?
BTW, It would be nice to be able to just skip ticks, maybe Martin's 
cputime patch allows that.

Yeah, it could be that NAP mode wakes up too early. I haven't looked
much what happens on my machine with ACPI, but I have feeling C2 idle
mode wakes up before the next timer interrupt.
It could also be that the difference between idling the cpu more 
is minimal. But if there's a difference with HZ=1000, it sounds like
idling the cpu longer should make a difference. Unless of course
calling next_timer_interrupt() continuously eats away the gain :)

I think that's where there should be some real power savings showing up.
