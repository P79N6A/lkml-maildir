Thank you very much for testing the patch! And doubly so for uncovering
this deficiency, which I will work to correct in short order as soon as
I can get to some UP APIC machines (tomorrow).
It looks like things may be going wrong around line 675 of apic.c,
though I can't say more for sure at the moment.
Thanks,
Bill
