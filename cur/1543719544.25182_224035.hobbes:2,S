I think it's intentional, so that if you you boot to a different kernel swapon 
-a won't automount the swap partition and hork your saved image.
Of course, mounting/fscking any of the filesystems in question would kinda 
screw that up too, and if the swap partition's is in the other kernel's fstab 
then presumably overlapping filesystems probably are too.  (Intentional isn't 
necessarily the same thing as right... :)
