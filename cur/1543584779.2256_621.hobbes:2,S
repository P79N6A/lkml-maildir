Yes, that's what I tell people that ask me to submit the driver from
inclusion. The reason are strange problems, which unfortunately I have not
been able to track down, yet. Fortunately, they don't happen for everyone.
Unfortunately, that means I can't reproduce most of them.
I added quite some debugging feature to the driver, like a complete history
of every SCSI command being kept and output if something goes wrong
(_abort()). I guess, a good chipset docu would give more insight.

I'm quite busy, that's true.
The driver 1.32 (Dec 3 2000) can be used with 2.4.2. Just ignore the
patch rejection in the file MAINTAINERS.

Indeed; people report more problems on 2.4 kernels than on 2.2 kernels. I
currently have no clue why.
Anyway, you can use the patch from 1.32 to have the driver integrated in the
2.4 kernel and the use the version from Tekram. (I believe they distribute
my version 1.27, but I didn't check fro quite some time.)
I would like to hear your results.

It did change. For example the way SCSI devices are scanned fro changed from
T_U_R to INQUIRY. However, the driver has been changed to accept that.

Compiling it should be no problem.
Making it work flawlessly is. I'd like to know as well.
