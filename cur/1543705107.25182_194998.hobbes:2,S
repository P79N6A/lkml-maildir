That's a choice.  There is no reason why you cannot put the entry path
of all the stub functions called "read", "write" etc. in a special
section.  For syscalls inlined in larger functions, then it's
reasonable to avoid text relocation in those places and use an
indirect call as done now.  Surely there aren't too many of those,
though, because LD_PRELOAD libraries which override syscall stubs
rather depend on all normal calls to a syscall going through the stubs?

See Ingo's post.

I agree; it is not reasonable to depend on prelinking.

Not really, that's an implementation limitation, there's no reason to
prelink the entire system just to alter the jumps in libc.so on those
occasions when a new kernel is run.  If vDSO randomisation is per boot
rather than per task (because the latter implies an MSR write per
context switch), then a libsyscall.so can be patched at boot time.
Yes I know, extravagent ideas, just wanted to write them for folk to
be aware of the possibilities.

That does seem to be a very practical answer for now :)
