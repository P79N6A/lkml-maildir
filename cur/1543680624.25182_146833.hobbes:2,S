Thanks so much.

Well,when booting using the acpi tables, we need an equivalent hook to
detect_clustered_apic(), which is used when booting off the mps table.
Basically I just kept the acpi_madt_oem_check() name and implementation
from the 2.5 tree, but I'd be fine with doing it differently if someone
can suggest an idea.
