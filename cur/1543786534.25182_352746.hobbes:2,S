Just flagging the cpu, and then mapping that to the stack pointer found in
the associated NT_PRSTATUS register set should work OK too.  It gets
a little muddy if it crashed while running on an IRQ stack, but it still can be
tracked back from there as well.  (although not if the crashing task overflowed
the IRQ stack)
The task_struct would be ideal though -- if the kernel's use of task_structs
changes in the future, well, then crash is going to need a serious re-write
anyway...  FWIW, netdump and diskdump use the NT_TASKSTRUCT note
note to store just the "current" pointer, and not the whole task_struct itself,
which would just be a waste of space in the ELF header for crash's purposes.
And looking at the gdb sources, it appears to be totally ignored.  Who
uses the NT_TASKSTRUCT note anyway?

That's correct.
