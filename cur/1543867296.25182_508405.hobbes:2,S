Dick,
UNIXes use UTC internally which has no DST, but for userspace there is
"tzdata" package (with that name in Fedora, at least.)

- 2005r
  - Zones EST, MST, HST, EST5EDT, CST6CDT, MST7MDT, PST8PDT moved to
    northamerica to guard against old files with obsolete information
    being left in the time zone binary directory.
  - Changes for countries that are supposed to join 2007 US DST
    change.  This includes most of Canada, however entries already in
    the database (Alberta, British Columbia, Newfoundland, Northwest
    Territories, and Yukon) were left alone for the time being.
  - Fixes in zdump.c (abbrok): conditions are chained, and the string
    is checked for emptiness.
.. and many alterations since then.
So..  you may already have it in your system.  If not, just update that
one package.
