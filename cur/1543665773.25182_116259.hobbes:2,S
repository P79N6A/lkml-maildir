pgcl-2.5.64-3:
(1) remove some debug checks from rmap and highmem functions
(2) mitigate anonymous page fragmentation in do_anonymous_page()
	this heuristic is still not entirely effective
pgcl-2.5.64-4:
(1) edit all PTE's pointed at a given page at swap fault time
(2) comment some TODO items
(3) remove WARN_ON()'s triggered by PTE allocation fallback to lowmem
pgcl-2.5.64-5:
(1) re-sweep arch/i386/kernel/cpu/mtrr/ for PAGE_SIZE vs. MMUPAGE_SIZE
	MTRR code basically wants MMUPAGE_SIZE in all cases
As usual, available from:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/wli/vm/pgcl/
The fault-time antifragmentation heuristics here are largely ineffective.
Most of this will have to be revisited, but if you were seeing issues with
MTRR's or spurious WARN_ON()'s from PTE allocation fallback to ZONE_NORMAL,
these updates should help. Incremental atop prior 2.5.64 pgcl patches.
