Subject: [2.2.18-rc1] sis.o missing symbol errors (still)

In order to avoid missing-symbol errors for drm/sis.o
*all* of the following options must be set, even though
the specified SiS chips are not being used:
CONFIG_FB=y
CONFIG_FB_SIS=y/m
CONFIG_FB_SIS_300=y
CONFIG_FB_SIS_315=y
These settings are selected in the FrameBuffer support
section of .config, quite separate and distinct from
CONFIG_AGP
CONFIG_AGP_SIS
CONFIG_DRM
It would save lots of confusion if these constraints
were enforced during 'make config'.
