Some filesystems (such as /proc, /sys, and so on - basicaly, the "pseudo" file
systems) are able to stand by themselves.  Filesystems that read actual blocks
of data off actual media will require the services of the block layer to do
that.  So if you've built a tiny embedded kernel that doesn't include the block
layer, you can't read those sorts of filesystems....
