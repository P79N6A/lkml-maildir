	Hello,
	I suppose this has been asked before, but what I should use 
/usr/include/scsi/ (the one that comes with glibc-2.1.x) or I should make 
a link 
/usr/include/scsi -> /usr/src/linux/include/scsi
it seems that the SG_BIG_BUF macro is defined in /usr/include/scsi/sg.h 
but also in /usr/src/linux/include/scsi/sg.h and it appears that they are 
not synced. So if I change /usr/include/scsi/sg.h (for cdrecord & co) 
should I change the sg.h in the kernel tree?
	Thanks
	- german
