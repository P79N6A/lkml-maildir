I'm using the default Fedora config file, which has
NR_CPUS defined to 64 and CONFIG_SPLIT_PTLOCK_CPUS
to 4, so I am using the split locks.
However, I suspect that each 512kB malloced area
will share one page table lock with 4 others, so
some contention is to be expected.

Will do.
Ulrich has a test version of glibc available that
uses MADV_DONTNEED for free(3), that should test
this thing nicely.
I'll run some tests with that when I get the
time, hopefully next week.
