This is a bug in the qeth driver. It has been introduced by this commit:
commit 3b04ddde02cf1b6f14f2697da5c20eca5715017f
Author: Stephen Hemminger <shemminger@linux-foundation.org>
Date:   Tue Oct 9 01:40:57 2007 -0700
    [NET]: Move hardware header operations out of netdevice.
    Since hardware header operations are part of the protocol class
    not the device instance, make them into a separate object and
    save memory.

I've hacked up a fix for it. The real fix will be done by our networking
people.
