Just built from linux-2.6.22-rc4.tar.bz2, with patch-2.6.22-rc4-hrt5.
All's working apparentely nice on this offending machine (laptop, intel
core2 T7200). In fact, I'm writing this very reply under it and through
ipw3945 wifi module--which never was so pragmatic on -rt2..9 ;)
Nevertheless, this is not preempt-realtime (-rt) is it? And I it never
