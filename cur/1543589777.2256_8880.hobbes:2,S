Ok thats nothing to do with I2O itself. Some hardware has the messaging
layer built into it as the messenger is very simple and stuff like the 21554
are using in I2O controllers.
You might find i2o_pci.c and the i2o_core message passing code interesting
but probably not that much. The I2O 1.5 specification covers the hardware
interface briefly and that bit is worth reading. Ignore the rest.
