Even easier - I submitted a patch a while back against the old hdaps
driver (on hdaps-devel) to use the hdaps sensor's keyboard/mouse
activity readings to selectively disable/enable the mouse (and
re-enable it after a time of no keyboard/mouse activity). This makes
the mouse device much more usable, and you don't end up fighting it
while trying to use the normal mouse/keyboard.
