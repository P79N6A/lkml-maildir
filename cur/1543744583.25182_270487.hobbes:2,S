Please do at least that! If a (non-ia32) machine doesn't have USB or FireWire,
it usually doesn't need MS-DOS partitioning. This patch makes it impossible for
people to leave out some stuff (BTW not limited to MS-DOS partitioning) they
don't want. I guess Matt will be happy to add the inverse patch to -tiny...

Are you sure Kconfig won't keep the old setting of MSDOS_PARTITION?
Ah IC, this is for people who start from a brand new empty config, willing to
solve the Kernel Quest with the 100000 Kconfig questions(TM) :-)
This looks like yet another fix for yet another PEBKAC problem...  Will (or
perhaps this has been done already as well) we hardcode IDE to yes (on ia32)?

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
