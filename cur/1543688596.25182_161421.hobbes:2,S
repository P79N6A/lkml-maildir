ext3 fs's could be read by ext2 drivers without having knowledge of what 
ext3 is.  Hence when ext3 was introduced, i could use present stable 
kernels to still fall back on in case things didn't go as planned 
(happened a lot in the beginning of ext3).  so ext3 fs's are compatible 
with ext2 without any knowledge of ext3.  This is more like the upgrade 
to ext2 that happened in 2.2 compared to 2.0 that made later ext2 fs's 
unreadable to the older 2.0 kernel produced ones.
you get no real slowdown as far as rough benchmarks are concerned, 
perhaps with a microbenchmark you would see one and also, doesn't it 
take up more space to save the extent info and such? Either way, all of 
it's real benefits occur on large files.
