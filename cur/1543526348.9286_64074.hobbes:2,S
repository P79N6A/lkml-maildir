# ls test

# tar cvf /dev/ht0 test

test/2.3.40
test/2.3.40pre1
tar: Cannot write to /dev/ht0: Input/output error
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
# dmesg
ide-tape: Reached idetape_chrdev_open
ide-tape: ht0: I/O error, pc = 1e, key =  5, asc = 20, ascq =  0
hdd : bad access: block=0, count=32
ide-tape: ht0: I/O error, pc = 1e, key =  5, asc = 20, ascq =  0
The bad access error was printed alot more than that, snipped for readability.
# tar tvf /dev/ht0 
ide-tape: Reached idetape_chrdev_open
ide-tape: ht0: I/O error, pc = 1e, key =  5, asc = 20, ascq =  0
hdd : bad access: block=0, count=32
ide-tape: ht0: I/O error, pc = 1e, key =  5, asc = 20, ascq =  0
Again snipped bad access lines.
Any suggestions?
John
