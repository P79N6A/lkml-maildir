So how do we want to fix this?  (This question is mostly directed to the
IB guys)  One possibility is to make all this depend on IPV6 in Kconfig,
but I think we want the RDMA CM to be buildable/usable even if IPv6
isn't enabled.  A better option is to just put all the IPv6 related
stuff into
#if defined(CONFIG_IPV6) || defined(CONFIG_IPV6_MODULE)
and add a Kconfig dependency on (IPV6 || IPV6=n) as we did for IPoIB.
But then this leads to the behavior that loading the RDMA CM will cause
the ipv6 module to be loaded if IPV6=m in the kernel config, even if the
administrator doesn't want to enable IPv6, just as with IPoIB today.
And people already complain about that.
Anyone see a better solution (which we could use for IPoIB even)?
