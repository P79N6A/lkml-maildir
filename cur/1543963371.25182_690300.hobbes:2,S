No additional patches. The problem already existed before we agreed on
the change to the pagemap code to just include the page size in the
values returned, and not doing any special huge page handling. I suspect
the page walking code used by /proc/pid/pagemap is doing something nasty
when it sees a huge page as it doesn't know how to handle it.
