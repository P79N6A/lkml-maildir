How do you find that offset?  You'll probably mention the S-Word but
we really want something that works with the latest kernel, not just
the vendor trees.

Yes, and that's a good thing.  But the interface for doing it is wrong.
You don't really want the users to do all that by itself.  For the typical
case of putting a probe at the usual points you want an interface that
puts in the probe given a name and does the right thing for you.  For example
the interface I proposed in my last mail.  Adding another field to struct
kprobe to specify an offset into the symbol would be the logical extension
of that.

Registering a kprobe is everything but a fastpath, and you definitly should
not have a lot of probes anyway.  It's far more worthwhile to have a sane
interface that the user can't get wrong then a small speedup in something
that's not a fastpath.  I think Rusty even has a paper or talk about why
this is absolutely nessecary :)
