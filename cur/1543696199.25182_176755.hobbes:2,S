Hi, 
David van Hoose started having problems with USB on 2.4.23-pre5. USB
device and acpi were now using irq 20:
host/usb-ohci.c: USB OHCI at membase 0xe081a000, IRQ 20
/proc/interrupts:
20:          1   IO-APIC-level  acpi, usb-ohci 
Which makes the USB device not work.
With -pre4 the USB device was using interrupt 9, because acpi failed to 
find the correct IRQ:
pci_irq-0302 [18] acpi_pci_irq_derive   : Unable to derive IRQ for  device 00:03.0 
PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A of device 00:03.0 
host/usb-ohci.c: USB OHCI at membase 0xe081a000, IRQ 9 
Now 2.6 assigns interrupt 20 to acpi and usb-ohci just like in
2.4.23-pre5+, but the USB device works!
Anyone has an idea why the interrupt sharing works with 2.6 but not with
2.4?
