V0.6.5 built and booted fine on my SMP workstation. However, just a few 
minutes after booting it exhibited behavior like a system does when you 
can't fork any new processses.
The system was responsive.
I could switch between windows.
I could switch from X to a virtual terminal.
I could type in commands but they never return.
At the virtual terminal login I could type the login but never get a 
passwd prompt.
Nothing in the logs during this timeframe.
Reset button was the only way to recover.
