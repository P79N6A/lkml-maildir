Well, we did delete intermezzo.
I was looking for technical reasons, please.

Again, that's not a technical reason.  It's _a_ reason, sure.  But what are
the technical reasons for merging gfs[2], ocfs2, both or neither?
If one can be grown to encompass the capabilities of the other then we're
left with a bunch of legacy code and wasted effort.
I'm not saying it's wrong.  But I'd like to hear the proponents explain why
it's right, please.
