SIGNAL_STOP_DEQUEUED is that second flag (its lack says to abort the stop).

Yes, I think you are right that this could happen.  It is indeed wrong that
it's possible to stop with SIGTTIN when the SIGCONT was posted second.

I don't recall why this went into dequeue_signal in the first place.  It's
possible there was a specific reason at the time, but I can't find one now.
Probably it just seemed natural at the time to set the flag very close the
actual dequeuing just so it's simple to be sure what the invariant is.
Thanks,
