Your other option would be to use processes with shared memory (either 
sysV or memory-mapped files).  This gets you the speed of shared memory 
maps, but also lets you get the reliability of not sharing your entire 
memory space.
If you use NPTL, your locking should be quick as well.  If not, you can 
always roll your own futex-based locking.
