The schedule_tail() usage seems a bit suspect. The asm code on x86 seems 
to play it safe, and pass the argument _both_ on the stack and in 
registers. So it looks correct, but a bit schitzo.
The others should probably be changed to use register calling conventions,
but it might not be worth doing so right now, and at least they seem to
agree on how to pass arguments in callers and callee's. The csum functions
are certainly performance-critical, but it's not like the argument passing 
convention is likely to make _that_ big of a difference, and they are 
"asmcall" not because they are called from asm, but because they are 
_implemented_ in asm (so unlike the other cases, these guys don't have
the problem with the callee thinking it owns the argument frame).

Sparse can't look into the asm code, but it could certainly be made to 
report on functions that use "regparm(0)". But it would be good to have 
something that matches up the functions with the asm code and verifies 
that they agree on passing convention.
There doesn't seem to be enough of them to bother with a tool, though.
