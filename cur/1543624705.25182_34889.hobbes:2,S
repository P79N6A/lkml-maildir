	Hu ho... You are reading LKML. I'd better be careful about
what I'm saying ;-)
	By the way, you are right, I've been using 9b in 2.5.6 without
any trouble. But, it seem that my patch will get in 2.4.X, so you will
have it both way.
	By the way, what's the situation regarding our famous ALLOC
irq handling ? Any improvement ? I haven't tried v10, so I just wonder
if it's worth upgrading ;-)
	Have fun...
	Jean
