Good catch.

Well PPC at least sez:
/*
 * fls: find last (most-significant) bit set.
 * Note fls(0) = 0, fls(1) = 1, fls(0x80000000) = 32.
 */
And that agrees with the generic code (used by x86). So I think IA64
is probably wrong here indeed. It's amazing that the other users of
fls don't blow up spectacularly.

If the "fixed" version didn't boot, how did the "alternate fixed"
version boot?
