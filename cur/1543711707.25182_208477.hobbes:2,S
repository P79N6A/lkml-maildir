obviously I read that comment, but I definitely hope he meant people
adding objrmap.c w/o necessairly deleting rmap.c too like me and you did
(i.e. we don't provide a CONFIG_RMAP to go back), and to have the
CONFIG_ in a Makefile _definitely_not_ in rmap.c mixing everything
unrelated in the same file.
Separating the entry points from the rest of the mm/*.c is sure a good
idea, and infact I left those separated in objrmap.c, like they were
separated in rmap.c, so you can go ahead and add an anobjrmap.c and we
can have a CONFIG_ option to select if to compile with objrmap.c or with
anobjrmap.c.
your example of having multiple methods in the same tree selectable as a
config option is the very best example where keeping the objrmap.c code
separated from the rmap.c code in two different files is a MUST (or at
the very least a SHOULD to avoid a mess of #ifdefs in the middle of C
code since there's nothing to share except the function parameters).
