Pavel, I cannot follow your argumentation. Could you please expand on how
measuring a script file would affect existing buffer overflows at all?
Just to make sure we are in sync how user space measurements work, here
a summary at the bash example:
(i) bash at point x opens "show_etc_issue" and holds file descriptor in 
    fd_show
(ii) before bash reads the commands from fd_show, we insert a line of code
    writing fd_show down into the kernel (this is a fixed size data 
    structure)
(iii) IMA hook in the kernel now reads the whole file building a SHA1
      (there is no interpretation of any content of any file here)
(iv)  IMA decides whether the measurement of the file must be stored or 
      whether it is already in the measurement list etc.
(v)   writing fd_show returns to bash
(vi) bash reads the commands and executes them
If I understand you, then you are claiming that steps (ii) to (v) 
introduce buffer overflows in bash or show_etc_issue. How?
Thanks
Reiner
