LVM and EVMS use this interface, but it has not been accepted into the
kernel yet.  I think Chris Mason wants to submit the patch to implement
this, but has not yet.  I believe the 2.4.18 patch needs changing for
both 2.4.20 and 2.5.x.

No, because there is no guarantee that the user process will ever
call unlockfs (it could die or something).  I _suppose_ it would
be possible to call an ioctl to do the lockfs, and if the process dies
before calling unlockfs the close() will also do the unlockfs.  It
could still deadlock on I/O to the locked device and never terminate,
and it would be unkillable from user-space (stuck in "D" state).
Cheers, Andreas
