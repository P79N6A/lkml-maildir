Grrr. So you need improved version of disk-destroyer.c to be usable with
your ide.2.4.0-t5-2.all.4c.patch.bz2 ? Or do you think it's hard to do ?
It's two hours work (if not half-hour) but I need 2.4.0-test5 kernel (and
spare drive to test it). If you REALLY think it's big problem I'll do it.
Should I ? Hint: you can install code equivalent of old disk-destroyer.c
in case HDIO_DRIVE_CMD: branch via /dev/kmem - there are more then enough
space to do it; especially with your chechks :-) Of course after that you
can not use HDIO_DRIVE_CMD as before but you can restore it back after
destroying drive.

Yes, now they are VERY aware. Sigh.

EVEN if protection will be accepted it does not buy you much (if at all).
That's the point.

Yes. Since it's just wrong thing to do. Perhaps you should change capabilities
check so you need not administrative privileges but also raw I/O privileges to
use HDIO_DRIVE_CMD but it's not papering over hole like your patch is.
