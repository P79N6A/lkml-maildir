being able to shmget(SHM_HUGETLB) as normal user. However I cannot
disable the CAP_IPC_LOCK from hugetlbfs/inode.c since that would break
local security w.r.t. mlock.
If I've to disable that single check in hugetlbfs/inode.c then I prefer
to disable all CAP_IPC_LOCK so they can as well use mlock.

sure we know, that's not the problem, disabling mlock checks is easy
with hugetlbfs marking the mountpoint 777.

never heard of those discussions sorry, though I'm not completely sure
that one single uid would work, a 777 ownership would certain work
instead, but how to give 777 ownership to not an fs. I mean, the sysctl
is an order of magnitude simpler and it covers the mlock and
shmclt(SHM_LOCK/UNLOCK) usages as well that cannot be covered by rlimit
either.

the real reason is shmget(SHM_HUGETLB) but if I disable that
specific CAP_IPC_LOCK I can disable them all, and then nobody will have
to use rlimit anymore for this.
Also consider the same user can shmget multiple segments and that can
exceed the 4G limit of rlimit, since that's not address space but
physical memory (either ram or swap).

Probably the main advantage is that it doesn't giveup all righs to the
user with fsuid == 0, it only gives it mlock. Though I can imagine some
user may not like to giveup mlock to fsuid == 0 either, so even that may
need to be a config option, but OTOH overcommit and other vm bits (again
stuff that can't be used to do real bad stuff) are already available to
fsuid == 0. So I think the sysctl-cap-mlock is reasonable feature at
least until there's a more finegriend way to give the
shmget(SHM_HUGETLB)/shmctl(SHM_LOCK/UNLOCK) rights.
