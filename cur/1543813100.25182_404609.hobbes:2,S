Games where you notice frame-rate chop because the *disk system* is
using too much CPU are perfect examples of applications that should be
using real-time.
Multiple CPU cores and multithreading in games is another perfect
example of programming that *needs* predictable real-time thread
priorities.  There is no other way to guarantee that physics processing
takes priority over graphics updates or AI, once each task becomes
separated from a monolithic main loop and spread over several CPU cores.
Because games often *are* badly written, a user-friendly Linux gaming
system does need a high-priority real-time task watching for a special
keystroke, like C-A-Del for example, so that it can kill the other
real-time tasks and return to the UI shell.
Games and real-time go together like they were made for each other.
