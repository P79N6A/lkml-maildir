If You have a great number of processes running on a system, some of them 
probably are processing ( feeding the runqueue ) while others, if You exclude 
tasks that do nothing but "for(;;)", are stressing devices plugged on Your
system ( disks, netcards, serials, etc ..).
These devices are highly susceptible to stress, and it defends Yourself firing
interrupts.
Now highly is the number of processes running on Your system higher is the
number of tasks stressing devices, and this stress reflect an high number of
interrupts == switches.
