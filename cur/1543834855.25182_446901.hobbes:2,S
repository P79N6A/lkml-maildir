Bah, doesn't take long for folk to start whinging about unreachable
email addresses. ;(
The one above is due to an unavoidable lack of connectivity here for a

it should work fine.  If you continue to see errors, mail the postmaster
address at the site you're having issues with with a transcript of the
error message.
