I think that you simply meant in your email to identify free software as
a cause for this paranoia.  I can kinda see the logic, and you might be
right.
But what I think what fired up many other readers (and me as well, until
I read your reply), is that your email reads like the solution is to
stop making free software/independant music/etc and just pay for what
we're offered.  After all, individual creations will only serve to increase
the paranoia of the corporations.
If you're offering that as a solution, you're far crazier than even the
most vicious anti-BK people have claimed.
