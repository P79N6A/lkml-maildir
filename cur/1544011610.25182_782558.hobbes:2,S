AFS was designed to support local disk cache, so with callbacks you can
get a consistent system.  I'll ass-u-me that Linux flavors of AFS have
callbacks.  It should be possible to *integrate* NFSv4.x with FS-Cache
similarly (i.e., I don't think you could drop it in as a 'black-box'
without breaking something, unless you explicitly build an independent
proxy cache server).

I don't know.  Yet it's something you want to do for AFS, I think.
