Ok, that's good. In the meantime, I need to produce the i386 equivalent.
Given how poll_idle() works (tight loop), I don't think we can just add
enter_idle()/exit_idle() around the loop, we also need to cover the interrupt
handlers, because that is the only place where we can catch activity considered
useful.
