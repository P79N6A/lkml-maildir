The ioctl has a version field:
struct dm_ioctl {
	uint32_t version[3];
	...
and the above patch changes version 1.6.0 into 2.0.0.
With sufficiently recent user space utilities all
should work: they can find out the interface version
using the DM_VERSION ioctl, and then adapt what
they send to the kernel.
(I don't know whether such up-to-date utilities exist.)
