I've already promised marcelo to setup some repositories,
one with Jeff's marcelo-2.4 tree and a few with patches
to merge into 2.4.
Then I'll walk marcelo through the process of merging
patches with bitkeeper (or rather, letting bitkeeper take
care of that stuff) and generally making marcelo familiar
with the important bitkeeper commands and some external
scripts.
cheers,
Rik
