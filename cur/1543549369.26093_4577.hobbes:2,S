The current manpage says:
RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1  is  returned,
       and errno is set appropriately.
Adding: "except on ALSA where certain other return values are used"
would be really ugly.
But you are right, Sun uses other return values with STREAMS ioctls.
