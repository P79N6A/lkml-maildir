The ISP can do several things to prioritize production traffic or drop
malicious traffic.  However, this isn't trivial and requires careful
planning, and it's unlikely that anyone who is able to would want to
do this for a T1 customer (typically, it requires "unusual"
configuration of vital production routers with the fat pipes).

In this case, it's a bit easier for the ISP because the tweaking can
be done on edge routers (which typically die during DoS attacks as
well, so countermeasures cannot be applied there).  Especially with
low-bandwidth links, it shouldn't be too hard to find a smallish,
geeky ISP who is willing to try some fiddling on the edge router to
improve performance (at least that's true in Germany, don't know about
the U.S.).
However, why can't bkbits.net distributed around the world, at least
for read access?  This would eliminate the choking point once and for
all.
