I do not quite understand why X would have issues with it. KEY_KPEQUAL,
KEY_KPLEFTPAREN and KEY_KPRIGHTPAREN should work fine even with legacy
X keyboard driver (one that is using PS/2 protocol instead of evdev).
You might want to adjust your XKB map or use xmodmap, but kernel should
report true keycodes.
