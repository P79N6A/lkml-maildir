Thanks for this detailed bug report.
Apparently, that naughty mailing list software apparently has dared to cut out
the "how to reproduce" section, as well as all the other relevant information,
notably exact kernel revision, relevant kernel config settings, compiler used, 
the RAID / md configuration involved etc, all of which you certainly provided.
Sincerely,
