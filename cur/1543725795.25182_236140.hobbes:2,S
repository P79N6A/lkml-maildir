So you never ran that. That explains a lot.

wget -O cryptoloop-exploit.tar.bz2 "http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=107719798631935&q=p3"

In short: exploit encodes watermark patterns as sequences of identical
ciphertexts.

Actually loop-AES' util-linux patch can used in mainline util-linux-2.12
compatible mode. Just specify passphrase hash type as unhashed2
But I was talking about your rmd160 compatibity with ancient mount versions
that used 160 bits of hash output + 96 zero bits. Last time I looked at your
compatibility code it used 128 bits of hash and 128 bits of zeroes.
