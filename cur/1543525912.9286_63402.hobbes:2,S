Hello again
Now I have root access to manually mount/umount my laptop's harddisk. I
tried some rsizes/wsizes to find out the best setting. These are my
results (I set rsize equal to wsize):

* = knfsd
o = old nfs daemon
Your assumption, that the problem drastically decreases when I reduce
the rsize/wsize to 1024, was right. But nevertheless the performance of
the old daemon seems to be up to 4 times better.
