Not sure if you've stumbled onto the same bug as me.
My server have 2 Netgear cards and I'm using the National Semiconductor
dp8381x driver included with 2.4.23-pre3.
Also, my system doesn't lock up after `ifconfig lo down', ifconfig just
hangs and becomes unkillable and I can't reboot the machine, use ifconfig
anymore, etc.
