Hi,
I have read all recent mails about this misunderstooded change in 2.4
series. But as no one reports heating, I do :
for the AMD K6-2 on a DFI motherboard AT/ATX, using the AT power supply,
this option is buggy. I mean the cycles kapmidled works doesn't cool the
processor, they hot him.
This stops as soon as I uncheck the option "Send Halt command on idle" in
the APM settings of the kernel.
