mtdchar.c is one of the worst drivers inside the kernel.  The concept
of having a simple char device driver for flash may have its charm,
but the actual implementation is horrible.  And things like the
read-only devices are even unfixable.
mtdblock.c, while being quite a bit more complicated, does not require
a ton of ioctls, will not confuse users with minor number 7 actually
being device number 3 and magically being read-only despite unix
permissions and hardware properties.  Plus, it is just a file.
Can you name a few examples, where mtdchar.c makes sense?  I've found
it to be quite useless.
