Which is a reasonable and very unix approach.  As long as I don't need to
do more than advise about what to do.

Sorry I didn't see this question.  As I recall we have a special pid that
is not hashed that is used by the idle task.  
So it should be possible but it would need to be a special case.  Although
please note we have one idle task per cpu.
Is the idle task doing anything interesting enough to warrant tracing?
We don't report the idle tasks in proc or in any of our other user space
interfaces.
