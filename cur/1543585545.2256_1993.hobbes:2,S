I do believe the write will make the kernel write the first byte
into the UART transmit buffer directly. If this is the case, then the
data should appear on the serial lines almost immediately. There might be a
delay before the bottom half handler process the byte (or is the bottom half
only used on receive ?), but I do believe that this happens before the next
process is scheduled (BH handlers are all finished before any syscalls returns).
If this is the case, then scheduling out on write should not do any harm.

Isn't a jiffy 10ms on i386 ? Scheduling delays should not be any
more than say 50 ms, but I am measuring 500ms. I could live with
50ms, which would make my program finish in 3 min. Now it is using
30 min !!

Yep  :-(

That could be the solution to my problem, but I won't start on that
before I understand what the problem is ...
