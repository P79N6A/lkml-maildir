   Well, it's more a question of who is grabbing minor numbers 64 and up
   on the TTY_MAJOR/TTY_AUX_MAJOR major numbers, and the answer is that
   is the driver for the Z8530-based serial ports, macserial.c.  It does
   that because I based it on the zs.c serial driver for the Sparc, which
   also does that.
That shouldn't be causing a problem, though, as long as PPC systems are
either/or as far as Z8530 or 16550 UARTs are concerned.   
The tty_register_driver code currently doesn't mind if there is overlap
in the minor number space, actually.  The most recently loaded driver
wins.  The only time when register_tty_driver() will fail is if the
major number has already been grabbed by a non-tty driver.  That's why I
don't like the patch which simply ignores the error.  If
tty_register_driver() is failing, there's some kind of device driver
conflict that we should understand.
