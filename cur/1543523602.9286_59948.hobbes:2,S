[Should this be on linux-fbdev only?]

We are not talking about any miscellaneous user-land process but the
vesafb daemon which could set modes via VBE, svgalib or XFree4.

Currently it's a sad state of fact that a large portion of the cards are
not supported under fbdev. This is why we had vesafb in the first place
and the plan is to extend this facility. Of course the goal should be to
write chipset specific drivers in the kernel but in the mean time, a lot
of other cards could be supported.
