ok ... here so,e arguments why you could use this power-saving-patch:
1. my cpu is a xp 1600+ ... it is designed for around 56W power
consumption (as far as i know). his temperature is around 47°C under load.
and without the patch this temperatur and power consumptions is by no way
lesser, when he is idle. with the patch the temperature drops by around 10
°C and for the first time i noticed, that i have 2 temperature controlled
fans (cpu and psu fan) in my case. now he isnice quiet when there is no
realy load on it, and he only sounds like a hairdrier when he gets realy
somthing to do (ok ... when you  have seti running all the time, the patch
would not make any difference in poer consumption or temperature ... cause
the mashine is under load all the time)
2. power safing is a realy good idea generally !
3. that the amd cpu saves no power before u have activated this
bus-disconnect-function is a bug :) (as far as i know)
oh ...  by the way: i have not overclocked my computer ... i only want to
save a little bit of power, when my computer has nothing realy to do (only
surfing, mailing, programming) and i am glad that i now could have some
benefits from temperatur controlled fans (the noise level is much lesser
now)
