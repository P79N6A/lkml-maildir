Yep! Note: -j3 now gives you 2 compute "threads" in the build. Basically
(as you know Ingo), you'll see the best improvement when there is the
most opportunity for one physical CPU to be saturated and the other idle.
[piggin@ragnarok piggin]$ grep user compile-test11

Note here that both sets of results saturate 2 CPUs. My changes (and
Ingo's too, of course) try to ensure that those 2 CPUs are different
physical ones which is why they are getting more work done.

I haven't run your HT patch Ingo, but of course I'll have to get more
comprehensive benchmarks before we go anywhere with this.
