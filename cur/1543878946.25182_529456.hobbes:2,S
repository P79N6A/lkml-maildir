I would be happy to help with quick reviews. I would not be able to do
the "final" "code-perfect" review. But I would be happy to contribute
(more) time for this review process if it would help Jean feel more
comfortable.

Ah, Rudolf, you and I are in almost exactly the same position. In every detail.

I think our major problem here is that there will not be anyone
capable of Jean's work, and not for a while yet. I would have thought
you, Rudolf, were closest. The hwmon project really needs him.
