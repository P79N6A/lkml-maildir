Hi,
While running mke2fs on a three drive RAID5 setup, the message "Out of
memory for mke2fs" is sent to the console twice and the mke2fs process
is killed. Here is my environment.
Software
* Linux 2.20pre8 PowerPC
* Alpha Raid driver (for 2.2pre5)
* mke2fs (used latest version..whatever that is called.)
* ncr53c8xx scsi driver, (also tried the newer sym(ncr)53c8xx)
Hardware
* Macintosh G3 (266MHZ)
* 128MB ram
* Three 4GB LVD drives hooked onto a Symbios 53c895 card.
It seems as though mke2fs is getting way ahead of the i/o and the raid
software keeps creating buffers to do its checksums. mke2fs ends up
getting memory starved.
Any help is appreciated. Sorry for the cross-post if you are on both.
<>< Lance.
