Okay, maybe we're talking at cross purposes here.  We do follow the PCI
core API.  We have a __devinit probe and __devexit remove routine, a
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE, the kernel generates hotplug events when a device
is detected or the driver is unloaded, and so on.
I *assumed* that there was something more that we would need to do in
order to support real hotplug of actual physical cards, but now that I
look more closely, it doesn't appear that there is.  At least, there's
nothing in Documentation/pci.txt or LDD3 that indicates to me that we
ought to be doing more.
Am I missing something?
