D'oh. I meant to add this piece for precisely this reason. Thanks, though 
there is one thing: 
+
+       /* If devices of this class already exist, tell the driver */
+       if (drv->add) {
+               struct sys_device *dev;
+               list_for_each_entry(dev, &cls->devices, entry)
+                       drv->add(dev);
+       }
+
in sysdev_driver_register(). You must check that cls is not NULL. I've 
fixed it up and applied it.
Thanks,
