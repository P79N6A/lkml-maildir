Hi!
First, that file should probably be named sysfs-interface.txt. Then,
it
+vrm            Voltage Regulator Module version number.
+               Read only.
+               Two digit number (XX), first is major version, second
is
+               minor version.
+               Affects the way the driver calculates the core voltage
from
+               the vid pins. See doc/vid for details.
Points to doc/vid, but there's no such file in kernel tree.
