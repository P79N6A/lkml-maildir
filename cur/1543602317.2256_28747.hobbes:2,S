I would think that if you send enought data, the drive's cache would be
full and speed would drop to that of the data going to the disk itself. So
the drive must be able to write to the disk at the speed that the os sends
the data, even with write cache on. So maybe the speed difference is
caused by the protocol:  the system has to wait for the write to be ack'd
by the drive longer ( -> throughput goes down) when the write cache is
off.
