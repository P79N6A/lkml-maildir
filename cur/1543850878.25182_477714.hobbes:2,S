No, release_task() will reap the task. tsk->usage protects only task_struct
itself (more precisely, it protects against __put_task_struct()). And please
note that release_task()->__exit_signal() sets tsk->signal = NULL.
QUESTION: taskstats_exit_alloc() does kfree(kmem_cache_alloc()), is it OK?
Yes, it works, but is it good? The comment says:
	* @objp: pointer returned by kmalloc.
Another question,
	do_exit()
		taskstats_exit_alloc()
		...
		taskstats_exit_send()
		taskstats_exit_free()
What is the point? Why can't we have taskstats_exit() which does alloc+send+free
itself? This looks like unnecessary complication to me.
From taskstats_exit_alloc:
	/*
	 * This is the cpu on which the task is exiting currently and will
	 * be the one for which the exit event is sent, even if the cpu
	 * on which this function is running changes later.
	 */
Why do we record current cpu exactly here? This task probably changed its
CPU many times since it entered sys_exit(), so what is the problem if it
will change CPU again before taskstats_exit_send() ?
Oleg.
