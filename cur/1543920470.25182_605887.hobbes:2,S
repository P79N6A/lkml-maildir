Andy,
I'm trying to minimize excess stuff that's not necessarily useful for
everyone, and to match what is done elsewhere.  For example, I don't need
those extra newlines and find them a distraction.  And if get an error
message such as "put a space after a comma", I don't really need a caret
sign to point to the exact char in the line where it is.
When g/cc prints out errors from a compile, the errors are one per line, w/o
any additional context lines, caret markers, newlines, etc.  grep -n does
the same (also useful inside emacs).  So I'm just asking for a way to have
the same terse format.
If you feel that the extra info is still useful for some people, then can
you please provide a way for some people like me to turn off the extra lines
(pass a third -q, or a --terse option)?
