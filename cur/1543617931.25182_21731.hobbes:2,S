(Andrea, the previous version of this mail wasn't supposed to go out yet. I
fat-fingered and sent it before I was done. This is the full version.)

Yes, the harddisk is definitely slow: it's a hw RAID5 partition with older
drives, so writes are pretty slow.
I tried various nfract settings:
/bin/echo "10 300 0 0 500 3000 30 5 0" > /proc/sys/vm/bdflush
7:33
/bin/echo "10 500 0 0 500 3000 30 5 0" > /proc/sys/vm/bdflush
6:00
/bin/echo "10 800 0 0 500 3000 30 5 0" > /proc/sys/vm/bdflush

nfract=500 seems to be the best and gets much closer to the performance of rmap
and -ac. Writeout is still very bursty compared to the other kernels, but that
may not really matter, I don't know.

I've been doing a variation on that theme already. The numbers I've been
reporting are best of 2 runs. I have never seen the 2 runs differ by more than
+/- 10 seconds.
