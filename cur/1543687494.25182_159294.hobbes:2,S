Ok, I have IDE box with scsi built in (not module), many people have such 
boxes,
I have alias scsi_hostadapter off, and I _have_ this annoying pseudo-error 
message.
(As I've said scsi starts before we can access modules.conf)
My solution is better. It is tested. Works perfect. All happy.
Please apply.
