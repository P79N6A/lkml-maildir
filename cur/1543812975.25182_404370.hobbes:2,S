Cool. I agree with you there.

I'm confused by what you are saying. The only actual input mechanism
that is physically hooked up on this Atlas board, as far as I can
tell, is ASIM which is connected to the buttons on the board. None of
the other capabilities of the actual chips are actually physically
hooked up on the actual board. There is no keyboard, no USB, etc. When
I press the physical buttons on the board, I get events such as the
following:
evregion-0303 [19] ev_address_space_dispa: No handler for Region
[ASI2] (cf7809fc) [user_defined_region]
 exfldio-0284: *** Error: Region user_defined_region(81) has no handler

Sure. As per the dmesg above, the button presses are generating
something from region 81. So my solution to that was to hookup an
address space handler for region 81 for the ASIM HID and then generate
the corresponding button events in the handler. That's the code that
you see below:
I hope what I've explained above makes sense. To reiterate, if you
want me to do something with respect to hotkey, I still don't
understand how and where hotkey is involved. Perhaps you could help me
by elaborating further.
