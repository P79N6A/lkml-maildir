	Yes, I know perfectly. A patch is needed, however I don't
think your current patch is the most appropriate solution.
	The current solution is :
	1) set perm key -> goes in the eeprom, reset MAC
	2) set temp key -> not in the eeprom, reset MAC
	o /proc can set (1) and (2)
	o iwconfig can only set (1)
	o xsupplicant always set (1) - broken
	You solution is :
	1) set temp key -> not in the eeprom, not reset MAC
	2a) set perm key -> goes in the eeprom, reset MAC
	2b) set perm key -> goes in the eeprom, not reset MAC
	o module parameter select (2a) or (2b)
	o iwconfig can set (2) {default} or (1) {temp keyword}
	o old xsupplicant set (2) - may work, depend on module parameter
	o new xsupplicant set (1) - always work
	First, do we know for sure that all Aironet firmware will
accept to change the perm WEP key without having to reset the MAC ?
Maybe the Cisco driver does it this way, but it only target the latest
firware rev, whereas up to know we have included in the driver code
for very antique firmware rev. I don't have the answer to that one.
	Second, I think that the module parameter is counter
productive. What we want there is people migrating to the new
xsupplicant that does the right thing. Also, module parameter is not
something that can be changed on the fly, and is one more thing to
configure. We want things to always work, all the time.
	What I would think is better long term :
	1) set temp key -> not in the eeprom, not reset MAC
	2) set perm key -> goes in the eeprom, reset MAC
	o iwconfig can set (2) {default} or (1) {temp keyword}
	o old xsupplicant set (2) - always broken
	o new xsupplicant set (1) - always work
	But, that's only my personal opinion, and you may want to
check what the new xsupplicant is doing before making the final
decision.
