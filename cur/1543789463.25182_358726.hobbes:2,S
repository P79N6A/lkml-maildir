1) I managed to get through the whole day running Jack at 64/2 with no
xruns. A first.
2) I'm not clear about the latency Daniel reported. IS that the logout
problem I'm seeing or something else.
WRT the logout problem - after being logged in for a while the log out
problem doesn't happen. It only happens if I log out relatively soon
after logging in.
Great work Ingo!
