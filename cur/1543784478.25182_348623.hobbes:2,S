I do not understand this question.  I guess "cpusets for sched
domains" means "cpusets whose 'cpu_exclusive' attribute is
marked true, but which have no child cpusets so marked."
But even that guess I am unsure of, and the rest of the sentence
"which have the same ..." I don't even have a guess what means.
