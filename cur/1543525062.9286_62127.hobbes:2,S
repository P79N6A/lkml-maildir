Thanks all!
Based upon the information I got back, double buffering is in fact the
route I should take for this driver.  
To answer a couple of questions (in case you care ;) ):
I'm doing some simple data transfer over a small buffer (<PAGE_SIZE),
where data loss is less important than getting the data off the device. 
I asked a more general question since I'm still a neophyte in the Linux
kernel and want to know more than just what's needed for this specific
driver.  
Thank you all for your insights; I can see there's a lot to learn. :)
