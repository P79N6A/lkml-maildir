I have very similar things on my intel boxes.
My 486 has 12 leds connected to paralel port (and that is way cooler
than single led).
My pentium programs video into 43.5 chars vertically. I then use
incomplete last line for status indication (currently only "cpu in
use" light which changes color according to load (green - niced tasks,
yellow - normal, red - system tasks)).
Of course, hack on pentium does not work under X. I don't like X, anyway.
