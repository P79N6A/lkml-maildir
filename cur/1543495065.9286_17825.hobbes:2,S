I don't understand 'dangerous' the execution on my system is exactly
as expected:
First you must assemble at 100 if you want to do things without trashing
memory you don't own. When you assemble in DOS DEBUG, you make a memory
image called a 'COM' file.
Here I have assembled 4 CLIs and 3 NOPS. This is done in the DOS-in-the
box window. I cut and paste to Linux `cat >filename`.

I will now set the IP to 100H where I assembled it. Then I will trace it.
Note that DEBUG stops AFTER the first NOP because it puts 'int3'
instructions there. Also, note that the IP and the code is exactly
as written.
-rip
IP 0105
:100
-t
AX=0000  BX=0000  CX=0000  DX=0000  SP=FFEE  BP=0000  SI=0000  DI=0000
DS=09C0  ES=09C0  SS=09C0  CS=09C0  IP=0105   NV UP DI PL NZ NA PO NC
09C0:0105 90            NOP
-t
AX=0000  BX=0000  CX=0000  DX=0000  SP=FFEE  BP=0000  SI=0000  DI=0000
DS=09C0  ES=09C0  SS=09C0  CS=09C0  IP=0106   NV UP DI PL NZ NA PO NC
09C0:0106 90            NOP
-t
AX=0000  BX=0000  CX=0000  DX=0000  SP=FFEE  BP=0000  SI=0000  DI=0000
DS=09C0  ES=09C0  SS=09C0  CS=09C0  IP=0107   NV UP DI PL NZ NA PO NC
09C0:0107 47            INC     DI
-q
Note that the 'cli' instructions were not executed. Each of the 4 were
trapped by the kernel, then ignored, the IP was advanced. This is
certainly the expected response.
What would you expect? 
Here we have all the instructions executed except 'cli' and everything
contains the correct values. How can this be dangerous? Note if you
do something real bad, you just return to Linux. The normal way to
get out of virtual-mode DOS is to execute the DOS cold boot vector, i.e.,
branch to FFFF:0000
I certainly would not want VM-86 to run any different!
