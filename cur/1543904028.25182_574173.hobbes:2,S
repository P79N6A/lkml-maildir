On later Intel processors, if the memory address range being referenced
(and say written to) by the (locked) instruction is in the cache of a
CPU, then it will not assert the LOCK signal on the system bus --
thus not assume exclusive use of shared memory. So other CPUs are free
to modify (other) memory at that point. Cache coherency will still
ensure _that_ (locked) memory area is still updated atomically, though.

Yup, David has laid this out clearly, as well.

I might be making a radical turn-around here, but all of a
sudden I think it's actually a good idea to put a complete
memory clobber in set_bit/clear_bit and friends themselves,
and leave the "__" variants as they are.
