While trying to combine voluntary-preempt-2.6.8-rc2-L2 with software suspend 2 
(swsusp2) I noticed that:
a) with voluntary-preempt = 3
      - writing suspend image to disk is very slow
      - resume fails !
b) with voluntary-preempt = 2
      - writing suspend image to disk is very slow
      - resume works but very slow
c) with voluntary-preempt = 1/0
      - all works as expected
It might be interesting for you to test it with suspend(1) / pm_disk (sorry, 
these don't work for me). I wonder if they'll also fail.
Regards,
Carsten
