I'm using a RocketRAID 1540 SATA card (hpt374 based) in an Alpha
system.  It has no such thing as ACPI.  The disks are four Seagate
Barracuda 7200.7 running software raid5.  My /proc/interrupts:
  1:      11440          XT-PIC   keyboard
  2:          0          XT-PIC   cascade
  8:  179530685             RTC  +timer
 14:        198          XT-PIC  +ide0
 15:         11          XT-PIC  +ide1
 22:          0             SRM   timer-cascade
 24:          0             SRM   usb-ohci
 25:    2327086             SRM  +CMI8738-MC6
 26:    4198981             SRM   ide2,  ide3,  ide4,  ide5

The hpt374 is on IRQ 26.
