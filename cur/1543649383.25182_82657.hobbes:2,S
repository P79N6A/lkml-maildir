He's done more than one thing in the past that has made me want to tear
my hair out. I agree with you. He has a bit to much "my way or my way" 
seasoning for my tastes as well and I honestly do wish that RMS would
give an honest shot at trying to convert the world to his way of
thinking in smaller steps...  One thing to his credit though... He 
has accomplished an awful lot. Would you agree with this?

If we accept your argument as it stands, then my point is valid. Larry
and RMS don't have the same goal. I don't agree with Larry and your
stand about Larry's goal, but I'll follow that up in my reply to Larry
this evening.
