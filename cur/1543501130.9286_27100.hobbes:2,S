afaik ext2 stores directory entries in a simple file-like unit, so there
is no limit for number of files in a directory only the maximum file size.
Of course system goes slow when storing lots of files since ext2 using
linear algortithm. I think eg raiserfs uses balanced trees and advanced
search algorithms based on trees to speed up this task.
