Rusty had to revert this to the old scheme, as e.g. scsi relied on it.
This means the kernel will oops, if someone gets a reference to a module
and its init function fails.
Above scheme is not without problems either, a failing try_module_get()
suddenly gets a double meaning. Now it also means that the module might
be ready soon, please try again later, what increases the complexity of
the whole module business. 
BTW what makes it currently even more complex is that there is also no
synchronization by the module-init-tools done anymore, a
try_module_get()/request_module()/try_module_get() sequence does give no
definitive answer anymore, whether a module is available or not. The
results will be spurious kmod failures.

It's not that simple, try_module_get() does not everything. It's the
responsibility of the caller to protect the owner pointer, so
try_module_get() itself is only usable within some locking. This means
your patch is still not safe, as the test is done too late.
bye, Roman
