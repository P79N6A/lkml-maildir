kmalloc allocates from generic slab caches. They come in sizes of powers
of 2 from 32B to 128KiB. The largest has slabs 128KiB large (on i386 at least).
Pages are allocated via __get_free_pages, so they have to be continuous.
However if you allocate namy instances of some structure, it's best to create
a kmem cache and allocate via kmem_cache_alloc (since it does not round the
requested size up to a power of two).
