for_each_cpu() effectively is for_each_possible_cpu() as far as
generic code is concerned. In other words, nobody would ever expect
for_each_cpu to return an _impossible_ CPU, thus you are just
adding a redundant element to the name.
The only places where things might care is arch bootup code, but
the cpu interface is such that the arch code is expected to _hide_
any weird details from these generic interfaces.
