Build bugs slipped through that net too in the past.
And we dont really want developers and maintainers to rely on an external 
middle man facility to be able to submit patches. So the best method is to 
make the defconfigs good enough to catch everyday build bugs. Random 
testing and linux-next can then catch the weird special cases as well.
