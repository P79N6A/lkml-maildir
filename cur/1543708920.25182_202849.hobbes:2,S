I'm just installing debian woody on a new server DL140.
I'm trying to  get 2.4.25 working on  it, but I'm having  a problem with
its two broadcomm  cards. When it boots  I cannot see the  devices, if I
give lspci I just  get the cards starting with 00:* but  I don't see the
two networking cards that have got an address starting with 02:* .
I thought  it was an apic  problem, I tried  to boot with noapic  an the
server was  unusable: the cards don't  come up and the  keyboard doesn't
work.
Does anyone of you have got an idea?
PS: can you please cc me, for I didn't subscribe the list, please?
