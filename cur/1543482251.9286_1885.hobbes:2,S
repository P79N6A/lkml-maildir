Alpha PC164LX (PC164 config), egcs-1.1.1, 128M
I did a 'make MAKE="make -j5" boot' (I have 1 cpu) while watching with
vmstat and top.  Much swapping and eventually the make failed (!) for some
reason I can't discover (subsequent make dep clean boot worked, and I have
yet to discover any missing files).  Meanwhile the top froze in the D
state; alt-sysrq-t sez: 
top       71 D fffffc000031e7d4     0  4049      1          6962   951
   sig: 1 0000000000044103 0000000000000000 : X 
Relevent System.map lines:
fffffc000031e700 T __up
fffffc000031e760 T __down
fffffc000031e8a0 T __down_interruptible
[I also tried to kill (both -15 and -9) the top.]

Life would be a ding-a-derry,
