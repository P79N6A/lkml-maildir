Thanks, and hopefully this too will lighten your load. I was able to find a driver that does work for the DFE-580TX. It appears to be a derrivitive of DB's sundance 1.03a. It is being distributed from a dlink site and the license "MODULE_LICENSE" tag has been modified (removed) so this may taint GPL-Free-LGPL pristine machines, but the GPL still remains at the top... (?) IANAL. 
Thanks to whoever modified this to work with the DFE-580TX (MIND THE LICENSE THOUGH!) and to everyone who posted allowing me to find this. Here's the link.
