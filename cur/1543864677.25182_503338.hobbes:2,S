Here is one patch for CPU cycle accounting: (although I'm not sure that's 
really the one I had in mind)

It might also be worth having a look at oprofile:

If you are on IA64 or PPC rather than i386, ppacc might help you:

http://ppacc.sourceforge.net/about.html
Although I'd guess you are not on PPC or S390 as these already to correct 
CPU cycle accounting (IIRC).
Hope that helps,
Tim
