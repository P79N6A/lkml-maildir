This is "good enough" to withdraw my patch. I have filed it to
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=11312&action=view
in bug 8052
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8052
which seems to be resolved by the patch.

I have this output:
~$ check once
Loading module tifm_sd ...
Checking for a card at /dev/mmcblk0p1 ...
failed.
