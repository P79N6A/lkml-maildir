I don't need to. As I said in the following paragraph, I never claimed such 
a thing existed. I am only complaining about your generalisations which to 
me imply that an alternative better interface cannot and could not exist. 
Which is a pile of crap. Maybe tomorrow someone will come up with a much 
better interface/drive. That is all I am saying. You cannot see into the 
future to be able to make such generalisations...

WHAT?!? Get off your high horse, will you? I never claimed anything to 
prompt this response. I am just telling you off for misleading people with 
your statements...
Anton, who is starting to get pissed off with Mr Joerg "I know everything"
