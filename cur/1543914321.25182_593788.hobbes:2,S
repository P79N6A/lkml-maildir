The users of memory are various subsystems. The VM itself of course also 
uses memory to manage memory but the important thing is that the VM 
provides services to other subsystems

I have not seen you using mempools for the networking layer. I would not 
object to such a solution. It already exists for other subsystems.

The kernel has to use the filesystems and other subsystems for I/O. These 
subsystems compete for memory in order to make progress. I would not 
consider strictly them part of the VM. The kernel reclaim may trigger I/O 
in multiple I/O subsystems simultaneously.

Yes an approach that is fair and does not allow one single subsystem to 
hog all of memory.

Replacing the mempools for the block layer sounds pretty good. But how do 
these various subsystems that may live in different portions of the system 
for various devices avoid global serialization and livelock through your 
system? And how is fairness addresses? I may want to run a fileserver on 
some nodes and a HPC application that relies on a fiberchannel connection 
on other nodes. How do we guarantee that the HPC application is not 
impacted if the network services of the fileserver flood the system with 
messages and exhaust memory?
