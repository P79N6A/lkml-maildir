   Hi, I installed the international kernel version 2.2.9, I tryed to use xor
   encryption with loop devices and it was ok but when I tryed to use DES
   cypher an error occourred:
   ---
   winsuxx:/tmp# losetup -e des /dev/loop1 /tmp/fs.img
   Password:
   Init (up to 16 hex digits):
   ioctl: LOOP_SET_STATUS: Invalid argument
   winsuxx:/tmp#
   ---
   I entered a lot of hex numbers (like 4224245ffba) always getting the same
   error...
   I hope that this informations could be helpfull for you and for me ;)
Hi there,
Given that I live on the wrong side of the crypto iron curtain, I don't
support the loop device encryption.   You should check with
www.kerneli.org hopefully they will have a pointer to the current
maintainer of the loop device patches.
