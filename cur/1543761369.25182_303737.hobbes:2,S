The current bkcvs export is broken, several recent changesets are
missing from it.
This occurs at least in the mm/ directory, but I haven't verified
if other directories are not affected. I detected this problem
because the head of bkcvs doesn't compile anymore and shows errors
in mm/* missing symbols.
One example:
Take this changeset from Changeset,v:

@[PATCH] orphaned pagecache memleak fix
Chris found that with data journaling a reiserfs pagecache may be truncate
while still pinned.  The truncation removes the page->mapping, but the page
is still listed in the VM queues because it still has buffers.  Then during
the journaling process, a buffer is marked dirty and that sets the PG_dirty
bitflag as well (in mark_buffer_dirty).  After that the page is leaked
because it's both dirty and without a mapping.
So we must allow pages without mapping and dirty to reach the PagePrivate
check.  The page->mapping will be checked again right after the PagePrivate
check.

Looking at

shows this changeset should contain a delta for mm/vmscan.c
However, mm/vmscan.c,v contains:
