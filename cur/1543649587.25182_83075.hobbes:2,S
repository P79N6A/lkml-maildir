Subject: [PATCH 2.5.44] Simple NUMA Scheduler rev4 (1/2)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/10/23/220

Attached is my simple NUMA scheduler patch.  It has been split into
two separate patches, the first part is a modification to 
find_busiest_queue to favor runqueues for processors on the same
node.  Care was taken to ensure that the change to find_busiest_queue
would not change the selection criteria used for non-NUMA machines.
The second patch adds logic to exec to place the exec'd task on
the least loaded runqueue, thus avoiding the need to move the task
to a different (potentially off-node) runqueue in the immediate 
future.  This patch needs the first patch to apply, but could be
easily changed to apply to a kernel without the first patch.
There are no functional changes between these two patches and the
patch provided for 2.5.43.  As stated then:
On NUMA systems these two changes have shown performance gains 
in the 5 - 10% range depending on tests.  Some micro-benchmarks 
provided by Erich Focht which stress the memory subsystem show
a doubling in performance.
The simple NUMA scheduler patch has been included in the
linux-2.5.44dcl1 kernel so has seen additional testing with no
issues reported.  I would welcome additional testers or inclusion
in other 2.5 kernel trees.

-	 * We search all runqueues to find the most busy one.

+	 * node and most of the NUMA specific logic is optimized
+	 * away by the compiler.
+	 * 
+	 * We must look at each runqueue to update prev_nr_running.
+	 * As we do so, we find the busiest runqueue on the same
+	 * node, and the busiest runqueue off the node.  After
+	 * determining the busiest from each we first see if the
+	 * busiest runqueue on node meets the imbalance criteria.
+	 * If not, then we check the off queue runqueue.  Note that
+	 * we require a higher level of imbalance for choosing an
+	 * off node runqueue.
+	 *
+	 * For off-node, we only move at most one process, so imbalance
+	 * is always set to one for off-node runqueues.
+	 * 
 	 * We do this lockless to reduce cache-bouncing overhead,
 	 * we re-check the 'best' source CPU later on again, with
 	 * the lock held.
 	 *
+	 * Note that this routine is called with the current runqueue
+	 * locked, and if a runqueue is found (return != NULL), then
+	 * that runqueue is returned locked, also.
+	 *
 	 * We fend off statistical fluctuations in runqueue lengths by
 	 * saving the runqueue length during the previous load-balancing
 	 * operation and using the smaller one the current and saved lengths.
