If they were guaranteed ultra-light, maybe, but userland is just not 
trustworthy.
Better imho would be something like Davide's SOFT_RR with an additional 
automatic priority adjust per cpu usage or something (cpu usage being a 
[very] little bit of a latency hint, and a great 'hurt me' hint).  Best 
would be an API that allowed userland applications to describe their 
latency requirements explicitly, with the scheduler watching users of this 
API like a hawk, ever ready to sanction abusers.  Anything I think about in 
this area gets uncomfortably close to hard rt though, and all of the wisdom 
I've heard on LKLM over the years wrt separation of problem spaces comes 
flooding back.
