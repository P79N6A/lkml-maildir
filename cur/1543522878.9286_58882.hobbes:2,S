Shortly before I went and purchased $10,000 encryption co-processors for
my SSL web servers it was not unusual to see a 5 min loadave of 30-50 (and
one time I saw it go up to 144!!). This was on AIX quad 233 2G ram RS/6000
servers, after I got the encryption co-processors the loadave dropped to
5-10
