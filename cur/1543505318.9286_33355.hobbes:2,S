Can't mount root fs. On a machine that was running pre1. No changes, just
make oldconfig, said N to all the new drivers, copied the lilo.conf
paragraph, and it doesn't boot. The last thing before "Can't mount root fs"
is "Partition check:" and no partitions are listed.
The root device is sda2, on an AIC7xxx. It still boots fine into 2.2.11pre1
