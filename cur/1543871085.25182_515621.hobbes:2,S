Making this unconditional is pointless and just makes things harder to
read, so please don't do it.  (The same is true for utrace, but Roland
has unfortunately still not replied to my mail mentioning it :P)

Please not.  That might save a few bytes, but it makes the interface a
lot harder to understand for users.  We really discourage over-loaded
interfaces in Linux.

Can this and all the file names please get an actually readable name?
E.g. hw_breakpoint.  We're not IBM managers that needs to save every
cent on superflous sillables :)
