Subject: [2.6 patch] IDE: remove WAIT_READY dependency on APM

On the one hand APM isn't enabled on all laptops.
On the other hand, this also affects regular PCs with APM support (or
using a distribution kernel with APM support).
The time for the !APM case was already increased from 30msec in 2.4 .
Isn't there a timeout that is suitable for all cases?

Until someone has a real good solution (consider e.g. that most PC users 
might have ACPI support enabled), this patch unconditionally sets 
WAIT_READY to 5 seconds.
