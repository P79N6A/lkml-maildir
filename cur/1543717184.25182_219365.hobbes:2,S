Well.... yes.
And thanks for taking time to fix it.
It now works as expected.  :)
'patch' complains about a malformed input file (the @@ line counts
don't match the patch content).
Correction is below.  Or were more patch lines needed (& missing)?
| Name: Show Last Symbol in /proc/kallsyms
| Status: Tested on 2.6.6-rc3.bk11
| 
| The current code doesn't show the last symbol (usually _einittext) in
| /proc/kallsyms.  The reason for this is subtle: s_start() returns an
| empty string for position 0 (ignored by s_show()), and s_next()
| returns the first symbol for position 1.
| 
| What should happen is that update_iter() for position 0 should fill in
| the first symbol.  Unfortunately, the get_ksymbol_core() fills in the
| symbol information, *and* updates the iterator: we have to split these
| functions, which we do by making it return the length of the name
| offset.
| 
| Then we can call get_ksymbol_core() without moving the iterator,
| meaning that we can call it at position 0 (ie. s_start()).
