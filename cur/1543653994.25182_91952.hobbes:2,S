Well, after further examination and manipulations, I determined that 
both the paging oops and the report of BUG page_alloc.c that I was 
getting are eliminated after moving my swap partition off of the 
raid0+lvm volume that it was on and onto a separate disk.
Still a bug, but a fairly obscure one. It's obviously not necessary for 
performance reasons since the kernel stripes swaps itself, but it 
certainly caused me a lot of headache until I figured out what was going on.
