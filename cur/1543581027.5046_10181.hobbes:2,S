Sure it can:
	close(0);
	close(1);
	close(2);
	fd = socket(....);
	dup....etc, for stdout and stderr.
That said, never, never, ever, check the value of the errno global
unless a function call returned an error. Many/most/all C runtime
procedures don't touch that variable unless an error occurred.
So, reading its value will show the results of something that
happened hours ago (line an interrupted system call).
