Heh, people ask me about this every few months or so, so you are not
alone.
Unfortunately, I really like the cascade affect, it shows that the
patches do have to be applied in consecutive order for them to work
properly (which some people seem to forget and then get mad at me when
they try to cherry-pick intermediate patches and apply them to older
kernels for odd reasons...)
If I wanted to respond in an egotistical way, I could just tell you to
use an email client that can handle the cascade affect properly, like
mine does :)
