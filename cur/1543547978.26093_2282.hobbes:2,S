   Do we know exactly what userland apps/libs use ifmap?  Maybe the
   damage is not so bad, so that we can fix this problem without
   making it look worse.
It's a well established fixed kernel API, any app whatsoever can make
use of it.
I advise you to stop trying to find ways to make your "quick and easy"
solution viable and work on the usable solution which will not break
userland.
Later,
