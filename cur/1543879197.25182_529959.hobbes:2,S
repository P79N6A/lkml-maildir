The Linux-ready Firmware Developer Kit team is pleased to announce the
release R2 of the kit. 
This release is mostly very heavy with bug-fixes,
infrastructure re-org. to make it easier for outside developers to 
write & contribute plugins, and of course, tons of documentation. A few
new tests and features have been added, including things you've asked
for
such as ssh-upload and a text-based version of the results.
The Linux-ready Firmware Developer Kit is a tool to test how well Linux
works together with the firmware (BIOS or EFI) of your machine, and is
designed for use by both firmware development teams and Linux kernel
hackers to prevent and diagnose firmware bugs.
Summary
=======
Enhancements
* ssh upload of results
* globalized DSDT & SSDT lists for standalone and .so plugins
* better logically implemented dmesg and e820 functions
* text-based results
* documentation of each plugin and the meaning if its results 
	(Documentation/TestsInfo)
* bug-fixes
New Tests
=========
* ia64 error injection tool
* fan test (now functional)
* SUN test (now functional)
* ebda test
* cpufreq: added test for Ingo's _PSS bug
* dmesg: added detection for buzilla.kernel.org bug 6859
