Subject: High system CPU% and load in pre[7,8,9]

I'm noticing an abnormally high system CPU% and load when running X under
the last three of the 2.2pre kernels (2.2.0pre6 definitely did not show
this behavior).
Under pre6 with an "idle" machine and X up, I saw a CPU% and load of zero
or very near zero.
Under pre7,8 and 9 the machine stays at a load of about 0.3, top reports a
constant use of about 5% of the CPU by X and from 10-30% in system.  No
swap is in use. 
Machine: Dual P2 400, 256MB RAM
Kernels: 2.2-pre[7,8,9] SMP
Install: RedHat 5.2 + updates for 2.2kernels
X Server: AcceleratedX 4.1
I'd like to track this down further, but am not sure what to check.  Does
anyone have any ideas for better tracking this down?
Thanks,
baba
