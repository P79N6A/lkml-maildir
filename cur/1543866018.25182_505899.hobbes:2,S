Out of interest, which people would this be? Not me, certainly.
I _use_ select, for options which don't have questions. There were two
such instances in the context of Ingo's mail of $subject, even.
And the thing Randy was saying "yes" to, which you elided but I've
restored in the above quotation, was the idea of turning 'select' into
'depends on' for _user-visible_ options. NOT for the ones which don't
have a question.
