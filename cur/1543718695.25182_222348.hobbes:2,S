It is flawed indeed :) (/me looking at it after ages). Even looking at the 
scheduler tick code, it does not play with mm fields, so it should be fine 
after the rq lock (and IRQ) release. Preempt is fine due to the preempt_disable()
(plus switch_lock held), tasks result running (due switch_lock held) so 
remote CPUs won't touch them, and scheduler_tick() looking innocuous with 
respect to the fields that matters for switch. Is it blowing up on ARM?
