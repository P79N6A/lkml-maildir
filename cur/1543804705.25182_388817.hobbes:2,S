Hello,
my old "HP ScanJet IIc" used to work so perfectly but now the kernel can only 
see something at SCSI-ID 1, but is not able to detect the device properly :-(
These are the 'kernel.log' entries after I switched on 'options aic7xxx 
aic7xxx=verbose,periodic_otag' in modules.conf file :

The SCSI-terminator is properly attached to the scanner and the wires are okay 
as well. Is there a way to find-out more what actually causes the problem?
