Problem is that the info can then get stuck at a vendor or maintainer 
outside of public view and risk being mothballed. It also limits the 
number of people who can work on a solution (including peole getting to 
work on auditing other code for similar issues). It also prevents admins 
from taking alternative precautions prior to availability of a fix (you 
have to assume the bad guys already know of the bug, not just the good 
guys).
