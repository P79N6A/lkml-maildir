Hi Alan,
I usually try to use BK's web interface "Browse the source tree"
for this:
  
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/src?nav=index.html
E.g., I can browse uhci-hcd.c, version 1.89, and see on what date
and who it thinks was responsible for a line of source code:
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/anno/drivers/usb/host/uhci-hcd.c
%401.89?nav=index.html|src/.|src/drivers|src/drivers/usb|src/drivers/usb/host
But that won't say what kernel version it is (first) contained in.
Just a merge date.

Yes, that bugs me too.

Not really.  You could ask on the bk-users mailing list.  See here:
  
http://www.bitkeeper.com/Support.Mailing.html
Or there may be features in the commercial version of BK that help
out with this more that the free version does.  I dunno.
