I'm aware of problems with knfsd locking for Solaris, OSF/1 and Novell's
NFS for Netware.  I've only got experience with the latter problem, and
heard about the others when I posted to linux-kernel.  It seems to be a
buggy check for read access as "nobody" by knfsd during locking. 
Unfortunately, I do not yet know enough about knfsd to suggest a patch
(although I'm trying to figure it out, because this is a fairly mission
critical bug for my setup).  Since my original post about a week ago,
nobody has suggested any solutions.
Not much help, sorry.
