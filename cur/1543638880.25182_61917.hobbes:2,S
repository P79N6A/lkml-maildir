Hi, 
struct timex in include/linux/timex.h is defined as 
struct timex 
{
	...
	int  :32; int  :32; int  :32; int  :32;
	int  :32; int  :32; int  :32; int  :32;
	int  :32; int  :32; int  :32; int  :32;
}; 
I assume that this is used as padding. Is there any reason for using
bitfields as padding? If there is, a comment to that effect would be
nice. If there isn't, the following patch makes the padding explicit.
