As I reported in the same thread as the breakage of modules in 2.5.59,
 module autoloading doesn't work for me since 2.5.58. Using Rusty's
 module-init-tools 0.9.8 or 0.9.9-pre. Same utils work flawlessly under
 2.4.21-pre3.
I can't run PPP, mount iso9660 CDs, run IrDA - anything modular needs
 manual modprobing in both 2.5.58 and 2.5.59 + Kai's fix.
