Thanks Arjan.
config DEBUG_INFO
	bool "Compile the kernel with debug info"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
          If you say Y here the resulting kernel image will include
	  debugging info resulting in a larger kernel image.
	  Say Y here only if you plan to use gdb to debug the kernel.
	  If you don't debug the kernel, you can say N.
"Larger kernel image" yeah, NO SHIT! ;)
Maybe something that says it may enlarge your kernel by 5-10 times would be
nice...
