And worse one has to submit patches for the core kernel all the time.
And it's a single table, which means there will be lots of conflicts 
when merging patches.
I think the new API approach is much better. Best would be if there
was a relatively simple standard way to add it to drivers  (like a 
standard module option). Then one could add it to a lot of drivers 
with default to off. Users can test then and if it works the default
can be changed.
