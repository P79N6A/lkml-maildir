I ran a check on my SW RAID devices this morning.  However, when I did so, 
I had a few lftp sessions open pulling files.  After I executed the check, 
the lftp processes entered 'D' state and I could do 'nothing' in the 
process until the check finished.  Is this normal?  Should a check block 
all I/O to the device and put the processes writing to a particular device 
in 'D' state until it is finished?
Justin.
