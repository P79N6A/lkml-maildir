           Summary: setkey -DP hangs system
    Kernel Version: 2.5.63
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: acme@conectiva.com.br
         Submitter: linux-bugs@treblig.org
Distribution: Debian
Hardware Environment: Dual Athlon MP on Tyan S2460, 3c905c net card
Software Environment: Uptodate debian/sid, ipsec-tool-0.2.2
Problem Description: System hangs (maybe oops?) on doing a setkey -DP
Steps to reproduce:
Both hangs have come when doing a
setkey -DP
I'm just trying to figure out the 2.5.x ipsec stuff.  Doing setkey -DP after
setting a pair of spd's seems OK, but then I run racoon (foreground with -F and
a few -v's) and ping a destination.  This gives an error about not being able to
setup the sa, so I kil racoon; repeat and tweak a few times, then do the setkey
-DP and it dies.
