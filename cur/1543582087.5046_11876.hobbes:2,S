Ok, here is the 2.4.1 version.  Note that it is slightly different from
the 2.2.18 version.  This one uses the CSRs and complains if the PROM is
different (but uses the CSRs anyway since those can be overridden by a
bootloader, etc.).
I don't have a 2.4.x tree handy that I can compile at the moment, but I
tested this change in a 2.2.x kernel, so it should be ok.
Is this patch satisfactory?
