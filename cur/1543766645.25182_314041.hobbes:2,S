Also, that may be wrong: maybe hfsplus_put_super has a job to do if
mounting fails later than "no hfs+ fs found".
My understanding of the driver is limited, that's why my initial patch
did the less possible functionality change. But I'd like to remember
you (maybe you forgot) that my initial patch wasn't about fixing the
s_fs_info leak, but rather fixing an oops that happens in
hfsplus_put_super. That's why I don't think we can run the current code
in hfsplus_put_super from hfsplus_fill_super cleanup part :
