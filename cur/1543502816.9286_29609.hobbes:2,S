this is indeed the problem. The patches from kernel.org are meant for the
stock linux kernel. redhat's distributed source already contains lots of
patches. Your best bet is to download linux-2.2.10.tar.gz from kernel.org.
Remember to move redhat's kernel tree out of the way before extracting it.
It will come out as linux/*.
