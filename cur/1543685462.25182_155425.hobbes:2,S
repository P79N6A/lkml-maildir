Tried the tool.
Didn't work for me, and I was told by the author that it requires 50% 
space for operation..which defeats the purpose for which I was hoping to 
use it (lack of space). If it works with 50% free, I suppose it will 
make people's lives easier, though the same could be achieved with a few 
resizes and parted. I was more interested in something that requires 
very little space to operate and is able to convert the fs.
