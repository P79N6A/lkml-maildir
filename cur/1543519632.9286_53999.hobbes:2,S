First, they aren't *wrong*. The libc6-devel version you are using on
that system was designed to work with the 2.0.36 include files and
not with the 2.2.13ac3 include files.
So you need upgrade libc6-devel to a newer version. That new libc6-devel
should include a new set of kernel headers. If that isn't possible
on RH5.2, then RedHat needs to be fixed, not the kernel.
Mike.
