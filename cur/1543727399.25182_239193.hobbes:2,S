You have had better luck getting that to compile than I have, but I'm 
still working on it. I assume that the note about sched compiling with 
SMP set will get me going.
Wish there was something like RSS for cache, so that one process reading 
every inode on the planet, or doing an md5 on an 11GB file wouldn't push 
every damn process out if it's waiting for me to finish typing a line...
I did a brute force patch for 2.4.18 to limit the total memory used for 
cache, but it would sure be nice to just limit by process. Yes I know 
cache is shared, I have looked at this before :-(
