I think the header/code needs much more comments so that other people
can still make sense of it later. Even with the commit log it's not
quite clear how it works.
Also locking needs to be explained. I suppose only one user is allowed
to use a token at one time?
But overall it's a good idea to have a generic facility like this.
I suppose it will be a more common problem in the future.
