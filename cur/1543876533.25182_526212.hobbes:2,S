yeah. (is that safe with tasklist_lock held?)
i'm wondering whether we could do even better than the signal approach. 
I _think_ the best approach would be to only wait for tasks that are _on 
the runqueue_. I.e. any task that has scheduled away with 
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE (and might not be able to process signal events for 
a long time) is still freezable because it scheduled away.
the only freeze-unsafe task is one that is on the runqueue, executing 
some unknown kernel code. But the number of those is typically pretty 
low, even with very large make -j task-counts.
now, the current approach approximates that set of tasks, but not 
completely: in particular TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE sleeping threads can 
introduce arbitrary long delays (and hence freezing failures). [in 
addition to any fork-related 'leaks' of freeze-notification]
