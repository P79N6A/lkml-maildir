Basically the rule is:

No. I'm saying that introducing complexity to catch errors is STUPIDITY. 
Often the errors are introduced by the complexity in the first place.
Sure, you found the bug, but what's the point? You wouldn't have HAD the
bug in the first place if you just wrote your code in a much more simple
manner.
The fact that you can add asserts is NEVER an excuse for making code more
complex.

The rule is: you make it as simple as you can, and no simpler.
It's a good rule. It's why I started a successful kernel, and so many
others have failed. Trust me.
