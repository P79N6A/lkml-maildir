Low 'ATOMIC' memory is different from the memory that user space typically
uses, so just because you can't allocate an SKB does not mean you are swapping
out user-space apps.
I have an app that can have 2000+ sockets open.  I would definately like to make
the management and other important sockets have priority over others in my app...
