Ok, so what method should we use to "switch" ? sysfs isn't quite an
option yet as the ADB bus isn't yet represented there (unless we add
attributes to the input object, but that's a bit awkward as it would be
destroyed and re-created if I follow you). A module option would work
but adbhid isn't a module, thus that would basically end up as a static
kernel argument, unless the driver "polls" the module param regulary to
trigger the change.. I don't think there is a way for a driver to get a
callback when /sys/module/<driver>/parameters/* changes is there ?
Ben.
