you want to have a look at
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam/
resp. imon, the corresponding kernel modules. 
this has been around for quite some time now. enlightenment has
been/still is? using it since it's earliest incarnations of its file
manager extension efm. (same with kde? not sure..)
i'm wondering whether this could get into the mainstream kernels soon?
i'm not really deep in the filesystem layers, but this sounds to me
like an extremely useful feature.
could anyone comment on section 2 of
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam/imon.txt
 ? would this actually be the
way to do it or is there any better method?
regards,
dns
