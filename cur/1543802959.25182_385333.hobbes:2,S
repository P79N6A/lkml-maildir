Why?  What's wrong with one syscall per hypervisor?  It's not like we
have a problem with adding 3 syscalls vs. 1.  Let the other hypervisors
also ask for a new syscall when they get added to the kernel tree.
And this also will let the kernel community monitor what you do with
that syscall more carefully (i.e. you only better use it for
pass-through hypervisor stuff, and not as a general multiplexor for
other things...)
