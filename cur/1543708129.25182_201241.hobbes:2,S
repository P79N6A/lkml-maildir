Depends on your confidence level, Michael.  We have ways of getting such
things tested before pushing them into the mainline kernel and we wouldn't
do that until you're confident in it.
And it's not really the end of the world if DVB is a bit wobbly for a while
(sorry ;)).
So yeah, I'd be inclined to push ahead and do the right thing here.
