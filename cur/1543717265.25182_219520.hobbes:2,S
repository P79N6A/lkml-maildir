I've just sent a patch for system suspend/resume notifiers that uses it. 
If that patch isn't accepted then sounds like this could wait.  Device 
power state change notifiers were also discussed recently, which would 
also use kobject synchronous hotplug if accepted, but the fate of that 
notifier is in doubt.  Thanks -- Todd
