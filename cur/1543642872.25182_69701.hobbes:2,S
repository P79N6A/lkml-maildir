Right.  Only the MaxLine II.  The rest, not including SCSI, are 1 year.
It looks to me that Maxtor is exiting the consumer market.  They sell
their crippled DiamondMax 9/16's, and the existing product lines, to the
OEM's who don't care about warranty as much.
They continue to sell to NAS/SAN manufacturers(even though they got out of
the business themselves), and to people building large servers, with their
MaxLine  II.
