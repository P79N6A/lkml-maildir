Ben,
Thank you for your response - it is very enlightening.
With this information I think I will be able to make a case not to worry 
about the processor cache.
If I win the argument, it will make my life much easier and my code much 
cleaner.
Thank you.
Regarding my usage of __pa() ...
My hope was that by allocating memory early enough in the boot process, 
I could guarantee that the same physical memory is allocated on every boot.
My experiments have shown that this is the case.
I just use __pa to report this result.
Thanks again!
