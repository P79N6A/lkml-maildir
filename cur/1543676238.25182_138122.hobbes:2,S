"hose" does sound pretty crazy, but...
a. "domain" is way overused in OSes and programming
b. "hose" is short
c. with old names like "d4", "hose" is better for tab-completion
I'm sure somebody could name a dozen things called "domain".

Does this mean you'd like to see per-BAR kobject stuff?
If I'm not mistaken, that is required for sysfs to work.
So sysfs then has:
devices/pci2/02:0b.0 -> ../hose0/bus2/dev11/fn0
devices/hose0/bus2/dev11/fn0/config-space
devices/hose0/bus2/dev11/fn0/bar0
devices/hose0/bus2/dev11/fn0/bar1
devices/hose0/bus2/dev11/fn0/bar2
devices/hose0/bus2/dev11/fn0/class
devices/hose0/bus2/dev11/fn0/power
devices/hose0/bus2/dev11/fn0/subsystem_vendor
devices/hose0/bus2/dev11/fn0/and-so-on
To make this clear, mmap() on bar0 would get you
a mapping of that BAR.
