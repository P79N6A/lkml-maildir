} No it doesn't. For all C is required to care about, it could be stored as:
} "mystring\0bla" The definition is 12 bytes on the stack, the first nine being
} "mystring\0".
} 
Depends on where the char str[12] is placed. If it is global, then it is
zeroed cause it's static...If it's an auto, then it can (and probably
does) have garbage after the terminating \0.
