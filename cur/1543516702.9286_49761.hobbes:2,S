  why so? the tracer needs to use "more trusted" kernel counterparts
  (operating on one security level lower than what it traces),
  otherwize you do get potentially infitite recursion. this is just
  like splitting sys_ guys into security-related part and the real
  part that just does the real job. trusted applications (root is trusted)
  can call unchecked parts directly. untrusted apps use untrusted sys_
  calls, depending on the use case (trace, debug, watermark)
  you can try to convince the kernel about your "clearance" at queue
  fd initialization time, ie, when you open().
  for different purposes, separate queues are maintained.

  IP masquerade does not require that much flexibility.

  ioctl=read and ioctl=write, but then not on the filedescriptor,
  but on the filedescriptor of the filedescriptor (semantics man).
  every other usage of ioctl is a gross hack, in my opinion at least.

  can't this be solved by adjusting the queue size to buffer the
  mismatch (speed of the tracees/speed of the tracer)?

  take SCSI generic. does it use IOCTL in order to forward both the
  control and the data to the hardware? the point is that if you have
  control then you have read/write as well...

  that is all very interesting, but ioctl still remains a gross hack.

  language interpreter in the kernel? I foresee viruses being finally

  I'll look at it.

  you have to make sure that your rules AND your evaluator are
  safe: this defeats the principle of modules.

  one question. you said that if the log can not be completed, you
  have to kill all running processes. what happens if your system is
  really loaded and your log needs to get overwritten in order to keep
  up. now, do you kill all processes? I can image this is a
  possibility, but if you allow for the log to grow...
