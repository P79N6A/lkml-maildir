Ingo,
I get the following compile error when using your patch
realtime-preempt-2.6.12-final-V0.7.51-33 on a x86_64 SMP system.
arch/x86_64/kernel/smpboot.c: 191: error: section of 'tsc_sync_lock'
conflicts with previous declaration.
It compiles fine if I don't set CONFIG_SMP=y, but then I can only use
one processor of my SMP system (not ideal).
Maybe you could find time to squash this bug.
Cheers,
Steve Wooding.
