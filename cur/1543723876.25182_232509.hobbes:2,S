Another bit to addr to the firewall / window scale mess:  I remember from
a while ago that the Cisco PIX firewalls would not allow a window scale of
greater than 8.  I don't know if they've fixed this or not.  It seems
like some sort of arbitrary limit.
This is obviously not the problem people are seeing now, but could be a
problem in the future.
