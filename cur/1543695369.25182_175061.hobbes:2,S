Btw, final comment: if it really is URG-only breakage, then instead of 
reverting the patch (if it had some other reasons going for it), we could 
change the URG test at the top of the loop from
	if (copied && tp->urg_data && tp->urg_seq == *seq)
		break
to
	if (tp->urg_data && tp->urg_seq == *seq) {
		if (copied)
			break;
		if (signal_pending(current)) {
			copied = timeo ? sock_intr_errno(timeo) : -EAGAIN;
			break;
		}
	}
which gives the right break semantics for URG data.
After that, the only other place where we should check for signal pending 
is probably at the tcp_data_wait() call. All the other signal pending 
checks seem bogus (ie right now a pending signal will mean that we avoid 
doing even TCP-level cleanups, which looks just wrong).
But reverting the change is clearly the "safer" thing to do, I just worry 
that Alexey might have had a real reason for tryign to avoid the EINTR in 
the first place (for non-URG data).
