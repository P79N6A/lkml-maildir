I fail to comprehend. In the United Kingdom, Linksys-Cisco B.V. are
committing a criminal offence under the provisions of Section 107(1) of
the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, by knowingly distributing
software without the licence of the copyright owner.
Even if the source were to appear on their web site today, their
packaging remains a problem since it contains neither said source nor a
written offer to provide it. In order to comply, they _must_ recall this
product and amend the packaging. So even if they are already working on
putting the source on their web site, they still need to recall the
product -- and should already have done so.
Once they have withdrawn these products from the market and ceased to
commit this criminal offence, _then_ there is scope for negotiation
regarding the ways in which they can re-release the products.
Until then, I see none. By continuing to unlawfully sell this product,
Cisco are clearly demonstrating that they are not acting in good faith.
I would like to know if this is also a criminal matter in the United
States, and if you have also discussed this with the appropriate
authorities, rather than only with Linksys/Cisco?
I would also like to know if in the US, as in the UK, it is also an
offence for the _retailers_ and _distributors_ of these products to
continue to sell them after being informed of the problem. And have they
each been informed in a manner which allows it to be proven in a
criminal court that they had 'reason to believe' (to use the phrase from
the 1988 Act) that there was a problem?
