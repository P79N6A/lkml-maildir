Ahh, thanks! This sounds like a good idea to me, hopefully your patch will 
be accepted despite the fact that Alan is busy doing other things ;-)
Coming back to the issue: applying these patches increased the throughput
by about 20% :-) Now it takes about 100sec instead of 120sec to write a
2GB file. Tomorrow I will try it without the write_times part, to see how 
much that does.
But more important: the hiccups are more seldom and sometimes shorter than 
before. With plain 2.4.19 I would hit it about twice per minute (I have 
not measured it), now it happens only after two minutes when writing 1M 
chunks at 20MB/s. The longest seen so far was also about 4 seconds, 
though.
Ciao,
