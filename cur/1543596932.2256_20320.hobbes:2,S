Works for me.  Were you booted off the 2.4.7-pre5 kernel when you ran
depmod?  If you were booted off another kernel, you must run depmod
with -F 2.4.7-pre5/System.map.  If you were booted off the correct
kernel, cd to the top level 2.4.7-pre5 directory and run these
commands.
nm drivers/net/tulip/tulip.o | fgrep cpu_raise_softirq
nm vmlinux |
	egrep '__k[^_]*_cpu_raise_softirq|\<cpu_raise_softirq\>' |
	tee /dev/tty |
	awk '/__ks..tab/{ printf "objdump -s -j %s --start-addr=0x" $1 " vmlinux | head -10\n",
	  $3 ~ /__ksymtab/ ? "__ksymtab" : ".kstrtab"}' | sh
