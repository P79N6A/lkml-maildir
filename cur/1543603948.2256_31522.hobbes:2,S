Try connecting to them by ip number - picking a page that doesn't contain
references to other DNS records. Then find a site or a friend who can put
a site on a port other than 80 or 8080 and see if that is mysteriously 
fast even using DNS.
If its the former then its probably DNS issues. If it goes away with non
port 80 its someones transparent proxy
