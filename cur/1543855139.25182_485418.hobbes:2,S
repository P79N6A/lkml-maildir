What you really want is if one thread is able to do all the work,
only keep that one thread busy. Only wake up other threads when
the currently running threads cannot handle the load.
Say you have 8 threads blocked in kevent_wait(). One or more events
become available. You wake one thread, and let it run.
If the one thread has done its work and returns to kevent_wait()
before its timeslice has run out, deliver the next event(s) (which
may already be outstanding) to the same thread, don't wake another one.
If the running thread blocks on say disk i/o, or its timeslice
runs out, the scheduler runs and wakes another thread that is
waiting in kevent_wait().
