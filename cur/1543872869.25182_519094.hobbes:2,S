Oh, of course you're right. I was inside too much layers to think of
the tcp protocol, and I did not pay attention to it.
Maybe something could be added to the manpage anyway.
The bad thing is that there's no way I can use a socket for writing
using select() if that connection has been half-closed by the other
end. Moo.
Thanks a lot for your time,
Lluís
