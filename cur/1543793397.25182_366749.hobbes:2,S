Yes.  They are loaded at boot time, and sit mostly dormant
until the main app is run.
But really guys, I'm just reporting a datapoint with the new kernel,
pointing out that it crashed quite unexpectedly for no obvious reason.
Previous kernels have worked very well under the same conditions,
but this new one has had this one spot of trouble so far.
A datapoint.  Maybe it will happen again, maybe it won't happen again.
Maybe it won't happen again until it's installed on a critical
server at somewhere like VISA.  Or not.
Just a datapoint, and perhaps the VM folks will think about the traceback
some, and try to imagine any recent change that could have triggered it.
Cheers
