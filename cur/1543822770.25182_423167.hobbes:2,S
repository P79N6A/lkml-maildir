Hi,
Just few comments for my understanding:

In fact, I agree with that for a lock (pthread_mutex, etc).

But here, I think this is what we have with the condvar, no ? When some 
threads are blocked on the condvar (pthread_cond_wait), they must be 
woken in priority order with pthread_broadcast, but there is no 
"lock-owner" to boost here.
Even if all threads but one are requeued on the second futex (i.e. the 
mutex used with the condvar), with the patch from Seb, they are requeued 
in priority order and thus get woken in priority order: we don't need 
any priority propagation here, I think.
So, I think that the PI-futexes are the right solution for the mutexes 
and rwlocks. But this patch seems to me correct for condvar 
(FUTEX_REQUEUE), I don't think that PI-futexes will add any benefit for 
condvar (?). But I may have missed something ?
