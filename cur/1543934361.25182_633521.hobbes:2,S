The __GLIBC__ uses look like:
	#if defined(__KERNEL__) || !defined(__GLIBC__) || (__GLIBC__ < 2)
That block does not affect any extant glibc, so we don't care if you remove
those conditions.  Any non-glibc users of thes headers might care, since
they are the ones affected.
TGhe __USE_ALL uses are all the same one:
	typedef struct {
	#if defined(__KERNEL__) || defined(__USE_ALL)
		int	val[2];
	#else /* !defined(__KERNEL__) && !defined(__USE_ALL) */
		int	__val[2];
	#endif /* !defined(__KERNEL__) && !defined(__USE_ALL) */
	} __kernel_fsid_t;
This might matter in the case of a program compiled in strict ISO C mode,
if some ISO C-standard headers wind up including <asm/posix_types.h>.  
In ISO C it is kosher to write:
	#define val die!die!die!
	#include <stdio.h>
though this is not kosher for POSIX applications.
Thanks,
Roland
