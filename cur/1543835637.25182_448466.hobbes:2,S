write expensive, we_rwlock? I like your idea of stressing the fact that
the protected data has to be seldom modified if you intend to use this
kind of lock.

I'll re-submit the patch with a proper naming for the rc3-mm1. However, I'd

whatever_rwlock code won't be debuggable with lockdep, and I'm not sure
there's not some more clever way to do it.
