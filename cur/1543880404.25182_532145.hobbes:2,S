Subject: [PATCH pata-2.6 fix queue] hpt366: fix kernel oops with HPT302N
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/18/269

The driver crashes the kernel on HPT302N chips due to the missing initializer
for 'hpt302n.settings' having been unfortunately overlooked so far. :-<
Much thanks to Mike Mattie for pin-pointing the reason of crash.
