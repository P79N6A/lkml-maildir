It is doable. It doesn't mean we shall do this.
I think some reiser4 supporters try to do too much too soon.
It is more sensible to do it in small steps.
I think we can start small and make all file metadata to be accessible
via file/meta/{uid,gid,mode,mtime,atime,...}.
Normal tools will be unable to see file/meta/ because file is not
a directory and file/ is not a directory (i.e. open(O_DIRECTORY)
will fail on them). Hardlinking to file/meta/* is not allowed.
However, file/. _is_ a directory. We can make a tar-like
tool which can do its work and save/restore metadata along with data
by just tarring/untarring file/meta/*. Notice how this 'new tar'
does not need to know about exact kind of metadata supported by fs.
You can add ACLs to the fs, and this 'new tar' will be able to save/restore
ACLs. Without any modufications.
Contrast this with existing tar which has hardcoded knowlendge about
uid,gid,mode,etc...
