I realise that.  How about we stop doing it?
When a thread exits it only makes sense to send up the stats for that
thread.  Why does the kernel assume that userspace is also interested in
the accumulated stats of its siblings?  And if userspace _is_ interested in
that info, it's still present in-kernel and can be queried for.

At present, yes.  That's persumably not impossible to fix.
