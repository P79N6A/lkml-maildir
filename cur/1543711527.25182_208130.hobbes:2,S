I had a check in a valid pfn in page_add_rmap() for several weeks before I
actually removed the test.  The debug check never triggered.  But looking
at the code I don't see why not.  Weird.
fyi, we don't need the check in page_referenced() and try_to_unmap()
because do_no_page() does not place pages on the LRU.  It is the ->nopage
implementation which is responsible for that.  Presumably the ALSA driver
was not adding the "page" to the LRU.
I agree that ->nopage implementations should not be doing what that driver
is doing.  ->nopage is defined to return a page*: it's crazy to be
returning someting from there which isn't covered by mem_map[].
I just don't think it's important enough to be able to cope with
non-mem_map[] "memory" in do_no_page(), so I agree that requiring ->mmap()
to synchronously instantiate the pte's and retaining the debug check in
do_no_page() is a good idea.
