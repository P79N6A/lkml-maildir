I think that will not fly with CONFIG_X86_PAE.  In PAE mode the 3rd pmd 
  (for the 0xc0000000 => 0xffffffff kernel address range) is shared, 
anything but 0xc000000 most likely needs some more hackery than just 
changing PAGE_OFFSET.  As the whole point of this split patchery is to 
avoid highmem in the first place it maybe makes sense to have some 
"optimize for 1/2/4/more GB main memory" config option which in turn 
picks sane PAGE_OFFSET+HIGHMEM+PAE settings?
cheers,
   Gerd
