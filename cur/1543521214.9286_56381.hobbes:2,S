The nfsd3_nlm4_2.2.13.patch is a continuation of the nfsd3_2.2.10.patch which 
I put out earlier, ie for the 2.2.13 tree. Since I had already built the 
patch when Neil Brown's patch came out I put it out too, which was probably 
not the right thing to do since that work is now obsolete, sorry about that.
The nlm4_linux2.2.13.patch contains the NLM4 server support not present in
Neil Brown's patch and can be applied after applying his server patch.
Sorry about the miscommunication.
thanks,
