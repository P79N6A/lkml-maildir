OK, so you have four reasons for dropping a readahead page
1) File was closed - trivial I'd say
2) Memory needed for other readahead
3) Memory needed for anything but readahead
4) The page won't be needed - some kind of timeout ?
Cases 3 and 2 are hard. Should replacement policy vary ?

I see no reason a change to readahead would affect that. Maybe I am dense.
Relevant seems to be rather whether you use read-once or put them on the
active list right away.
Could information on the use pattern be stored in the dentry ?
E.g. If we opened it twice in the last 30 seconds we put all referenced
pages into the active list unaged to ensure that they'll stay in core.

Only if they fit into ram. There's nothing wrong with reading the whole
accessed file if it's small enough and you have a low memory pressure.
It might cut down on netscape launch times drastically on large machines.
But if there's memory pressure you can hardly evict pages on the active
list for readahead, can you ?

Interresting, how do you do that, keep a list of recent reads ?
