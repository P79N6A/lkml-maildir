dma_alloc_noncoherent is a fallback for boxes with coherency problems
which cannot allocate coherent memory.  The API asks for coherent memory
but the driver promises to behave correctly even if an incoherent area
is returned.  dma_alloc_coherent() requires only coherent memory.  The
pcx boxes (PA7200 and below) can't do the uncached trick for coherent
memory, so the API is designed for them.  The PCXL can, so we allocate
coherent memory even for dma_alloc_noncoherent() in that case (and nop
out the coherency handlers the driver uses).
