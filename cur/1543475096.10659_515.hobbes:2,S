The problem is that v0.89H _seems_ to work with the clone chipsets
unless you look closer. Then you'll notice abysmal packet loss rates
and just about every packet not lost received doubly. Not to mention
abysmal receiver latency. So it isn't a clean failure, unfortunately.
I'm running v0.90 for quite some time on several machines
with different chipsets (genuine DEC and Macronix) quite heavily
(NFS mounted homes on one machine, diskless client another one)
with different PC mainboards, and never saw a problem that
could be attributed to the tulip driver in any way.
So if v0.90 is not acceptible for you then I suggest
adding the clone chipset initialisation fixes from 0.90 to
the 0.89 driver.
