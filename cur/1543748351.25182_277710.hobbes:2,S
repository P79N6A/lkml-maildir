Hotplug is the standard way of handling configuration changes (whether
requested or forced).  There's value to handling things in a standard
manner.  If the current implementation needs improving, then you're free
to do it (and it would benefit far more than just SCSI...).
So the firmware calls the SCSI API which triggers the hotplug event and
adds the device ... there's no problem.

No.  Merely that the hotplug API would also be usable by SES (and other
things).
