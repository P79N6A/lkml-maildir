Then the IBM PC violates the laws of causality and physics.  I would suggest
you read the chipset documentation however.
The 8259 generates IRQ7 (or IRQ 15) when an interrupt device deasserts its
line before the PIC receives an INTA pulse from the CPU.
[ or in actual fact during some of the other phases that go with this ]
Its in the manual. It says so. It happens.
