Yes, if owner == creator.

Not sure what you mean by inode+mountpoint here.  SELinux already allows
you to define a domain transition for the process based on the caller's
domain and the type assigned to the executable file via inode extended
attribute.

Attributes have to be bound to the actual objects, which means that
something has to set those attributes.  This is no different than normal
Linux DAC attributes like file owner/group/mode (aside from the need to
use extended attributes for storage).  Some package managers have
already been extended to support setting SELinux attributes when files
are installed, like rpm in Fedora, dpkg in Debian unstable, portage in
Hardened Gentoo.  install(1) in Fedora also is patched to apply the
proper context for installation of files without using the package
manager.  restorecon can be selectively applied to specific files to
restore their labels to the initial values specified in the
configuration.

If you truly need to distinguish each such program, then yes, they would
need separate contexts, although you likely can organize them into
equivalence classes.  You could generate a policy module in userspace
and feed it to semodule to be linked into the base policy and loaded,
although the details are not entirely clear as to what you would need to
put into the policy module (e.g. you seem to just want to define the
domain and type and then make the domain identical to the caller's
domain since you aren't trying to restrict it any further, just use it
for labeling purposes).

It isn't.  Path-based access control considered harmful.

You aren't likely to get much review of your actual LSM without breaking
it up into manageable chunks and posting with patches inline for review
to linux-security-module@vger.kernel.org.
