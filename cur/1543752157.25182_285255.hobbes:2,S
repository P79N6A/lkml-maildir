I consider the invocation of out_of_memory in the first place. This is

Your solution does not solve
- invocation madness
- reentrancy protection
- the ugly mess of timers, counters... in out_of_memory, which aren't
neccecary at all
This must be solved first in a proper way, before we talk about ranking.
You are definitely curing the symptom instead of the cause.

What is the default behaviour when no userspace settings are available -
Nothing ? Are you really expecting that we change every root fs in order
to be able to upgrade the kernel for solving this _kernel_ problem ?
Who is setting up those userspace constraints ? Joe User, who is barely
able to find the power on button on his box ? The sysadmin, who will
have to adjust the list for each box depending on the apps it runs or
the user who is logged into the box ?
Memory management _is_ a kernel task and so the shortage of memory has
to be handled by the kernel on its own in the first place. Adding user
space support for certain tasks is a good thing, but not a solution to
the problem itself.

I know the constrains of embedded boxes well enough to know that there
is a bit of a difference to a desktop machine.

I'm running Andrea's and my combined fixes on a couple of embedded and
desktop boxes and it has proven to be a proper in kernel solution for
the in kernel problem. 
I don't argue againts the ability to provide a culprit list to the
kernel, but as I said before it only can be a optional addon to a proper
in kernel solution.
