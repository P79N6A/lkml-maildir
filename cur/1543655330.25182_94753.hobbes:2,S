Subject: lilo append mem problem in 2.4.20

Hello,
Compaq proliant 5000 4 way Pentium Pro with 1 GB RAM only uses 12 to 13 MB of 
RAM when I use kernel 2.4.20 with ac1 patch even when I do append="mem=1024" 
in /etc/lilo.conf
RH 7.2 is the distro and its default kernel (2.4.7-10smp), works flawlessly 
with the mem append, it sees and uses all the RAM. But, their latest kernel 
2.4.18-18.7.xsmp fails to use the RAM as well; it too only sees 12 to 13 MB... 
this is why I tried the kernel.org kernel.
I used RH's 686-smp kernel config file to build the 2.4.20-ac1 kernel. I 
turned High Mem support off as I don't think 1 GB is high mem... is it? Anyone 
know how I can use all of the RAM?
Here's the lines from /var/log/messages for each kernel:
2.4.20smp-ac1 = Dec  4 13:44:48 localhost kernel: Memory: 12700k/16384k 
available (1396k kernel code, 3168k reserved, 102k data, 240k init, 0k 
highmem)
2.4.18-18.7.xsmp = Memory: 13156k/16384k available (1269k kernel code, 2712k 
reserved, 90k data, 220k init, 0k highmem)
2.4.7-10smp = Memory: 1026788k/1048576k available (1396k kernel code, 20376k 
reserved, 102k data, 240k init, 131072k highmem)
Thanks a bunch,
Brad
