Type checking is not useful for serious C programming? Really?

They highlight the difference. The preprocessor is a form of text 
editor, which only knows what the source *says* but not what it *means*. 
The compiler knows about types, common subexpressions, etc.

The standard should specify the source language and it's meaning. The 
fact that it specifies what cpp does (text editing) as well is for 
convenience. The language works the same whether you write it with vi or 
cpp, cpp is just more convenient that sed ;-)

Not at all... enum would have been better, but not so much better that 
it's worth doing over.
