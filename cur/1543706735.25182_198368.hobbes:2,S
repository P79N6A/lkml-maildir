Then I mean look for the filesystem you want to mount.

Well, if you know what filesystem type is wanted you could just attempt
to mount all the partitions from /proc/partitions with that type
(read-only) and look for a unique file - if it's there, keep the fs
mounted, otherwise umount and try next candidate.
That's basically what I do in an initrd I wrote for CD-ROM booting, I'm
just trying to mount iso9660 filesystems and look for /etc/rc.d/rc.cdrom
when it succeeds. Better ways to identifiy a block device exist, I'm
sure, but the approach works for me. I'm narrowing down the search by
scanning the dmesg buffer for ATAPI and SCSI CD-ROM detection messages,
but that approach doesn't work for your problem (and is also fragile
when using it across several kernel versions).

findfs from the e2fsprogs package, maybe.

Well, it's read-only access, so I don't see a problem even with running
it multiple times on the same device. Keeping a list of already tried
devices isn't black magic, though.
