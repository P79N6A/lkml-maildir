	here's how to reproduce it:
	dd if=/dev/zero of=swapfile count=8192
	mkswap -v1 swapfile
	swapon swapfile
	swapon swapfile
	swapoff swapfile
	swapon swapfile --> Oops
	cat-ing /proc/swaps after the Oops will also give you
	Oops.
	tried it on 2.2.9 & 2.2.7 on machines where i don't have
	System.Map handy.
