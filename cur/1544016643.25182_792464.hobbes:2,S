OK, now I understand the problem. The optimal way would be to invent
an abstraction for this external charge pump (in terms of PXA27x OTG
controller) and make DA9030 a derived class of it. But the PXA27x OTG
solution is really a hybrid one, and the existing OTG code is in a mess
(without a clear abstraction), the sub-optimal way would let platform code
do this trick. Yet the platform code is currently suffering from a missed
API to retreive this dynamically scanned I2C device. Mmm...stumped.
I would expect the final solution to be clean enough, that requires some
dependent stuffs to be modified, and the final look of this patch may be a
bit different.
