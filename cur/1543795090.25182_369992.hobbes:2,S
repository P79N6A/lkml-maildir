I forgot about the kernel vs user space termination issue.
One solution would be to not create the tty nodes and instead modify
init, syslog to mknod the node before using it.
Another would be to have a little user space daemon that listened to
the pty creation, and then mknod the tty nodes as need and pipe the
data through. That would be a first step to moving to a user space
console implementation.
I see now that the 64 tty devices really are there and are provided by
the kernel. It's just that hardly anyone uses all of them and they
clutter up /dev.
