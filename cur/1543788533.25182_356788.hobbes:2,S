I don't have unique serial #s available, but my question wasn't clear.
Is it ever possible that the hotplug stuff will try to remove and re-add
one (or all) of my boards when there _hasn't_ been a physical change or
power cycle/reboot/driver reload/whatever.
As long as the driver gets reloaded following any logical or physical
system change I will just go through the instance/minor assignment
again.  What I don't want is /dev/idr0 /dev/idr1 turning into /dev/idr2
/dev/idr3 because someone tickled the hotplug controls.
Still not quite clear how to assocuiate instance/minor #s with boards.
Do I just keep a global counter and bump it each time probe (or init)
gets called for each board?  Hence my worry above.
Thanks for the quick reply.
