Yes! The current implementation just uses all the memory available, and 
pushes any programs not actively running out to disk. Click the window 
and go for coffee. On a small machine that's needed, but for almost any 
typical usage, desktop or server, pushing out programs to have 3.5GB of 
buffer instead of 3.0 doesn't help disk performance.

I doubt it, but it would be nice to have a tuner the admin could use 
instead of trying to guess what the priority of program response and i/o 
response should be. So if I have a graphics program which might open an 
image (small file) and decompress it into 1500MB of raw image, I can set 
  the buffer space down to a GB or so (I assume that I do this on a 
machine fitted to such use) and get good response.
And even on a small machine with only 256MB or so, not having the 
overnight file check push all but the last 10-12MB of programs out of 
memory. That's the problem with the current system. As for hurting other 
systems, that's why a tuner would be nice.
With various patches things are getting better, don't think it isn't 
noticed and appreciated.
