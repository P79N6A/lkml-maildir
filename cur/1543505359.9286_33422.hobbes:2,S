Then check which program removes them from screen. Maybe that program
is not compatible with the way fbcon is displaying penguins (remove
program from initscripts... and try to switch to VT2 and back to VT1 before
login. If 'lspci -vvv' & shift-pgup then works, problem is in cls()
or something like that).

I think that it is scrollback bug - drivers/video/fbcon.c... There are
also reentrancy bugs in it, but I tried really hard, but I was not able
to fix it. So when someone asks me that matroxfb silently dies, I recommend
to boot with video=scrollback:0 to him. It works 100%.
