Ok, well that has been proven incorrect.  I originally thought it was
HAL that had the problem, but I think that is not true, as I am using
the older version of hal here (0.5.7.1) just fine.

This is what Documentation/ABI/ has tried to nail down, unfortunatly it
has turned out to be very hard to track down all of the odd userspace
programs that use sysfs and see what they are relying on.  We are slowly
fixing things, as is proof in the OpenSuSE and Gentoo releases.
And I'll be the first to admit that the ABI/ directory needs some
flushing out...
And it isn't really a whole different layout, the only problem here is
that a directory has turned into a symlink, so programs that were not
written that well (and I'll be the first to admit that I made the same
mistake in udev many years ago) and can't handle the change.
So numerous programs "just work" fine, but for a limited few, they have
problems, hence the config option so that nothing will break.
And if you look in the ABI/ directory, it describes this usage of the
class devices in sysfs.  But again, no one is flushing out the users of
these features, or even reading the stuff that is there...
So, again, a better wording for the CONFIG help text anyone?  Or a
better name for the CONFIG value itself?
