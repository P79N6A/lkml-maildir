I have an AudioExcel AV-511 (cmipci using the alsa drivers) and I'm having a 
heck of a time getting my Gravis Gamepad Pro (or the gameport of the cmipci 
sound card more to the point) to show up.  What kind of gameport do I have 
to compile support in for?  I tried standard plug and play gameport with the 
2.4 kernel and that says no such address etc. when I try to insmod ns558...  
I tried compiling it right in to the kernel but it didn't help.  I've also 
tried the 2.5 kernel but I still don't see anything that looks like a 
gameport in dmesg or /proc    /devices.  Is there any way to get my gameport 
on my cmipci sound card to show up under linux (both my Gravis Gamepad Pro's 
work good under windows98 so I know the port is good)?
My main goal is to have my gravis gamepad pro (gameport version of the 
controller) working in xmame, but just a few hints if someone could give 
them to me to get the card to even show up in the /proc filesystem would be 
helpfull.
(I've read joystick.txt and input.txt and the new input   homepage but I 
still have no luck.)
