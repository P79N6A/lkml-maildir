Hi!

if you saved your old .config you could add those features one after the other to see if it`s size related....

hard to tell without any further information on this.

i assume you meant decrease!?
get a in-depth knowlegde about all the different config options and decide if you need it or not.
maybe after compile, some
find . -name "*.o" |while read file;do ls -s $file;done |sort -n
will help identifying parts of the kernel which take up most of the space
maybe CONFIG_EMBEDDED=y helps, too.
furthermore, there are projects like 
http://www.selenic.com/linux-tiny/
 to  make kernel small for embedded systems.
a nice (but more generic) article about downsizing linux for embedded system is at 
http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9686
i think these mailing lists provide better help since it`s more likely to meet people there who develop for ARCH=arm
