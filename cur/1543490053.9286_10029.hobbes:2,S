Because it simply tries to reinitialize the whole PCI subsystem its
way while starting (and doing PnP stuff), and as it does that, the values
get lost (and even should they stay, they'd be bogus), and it doesn't care
about writing the correct value back, because IT knows them and thinks
it's enough.

When BIOS is queried about the irq number, it just looks in the place where
it has written it during boot and blindly assumes it's still there. If it
is not, it'll report the value which is there.

Hmm, but, with the different i/o assigned, but the interrupt working, the
realtek card could work, doesn't it?

There isn't.

I'm working on that with a friend here. A new bus architecture for Linux 2.3.

It should be possible to make a program that'd save the information, and then
put it back ...
Goodd luck,
