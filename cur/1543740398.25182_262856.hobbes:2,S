Perhaps typical end users are not our target market.  Instead, maybe we 
should be targeting companies that sell workstations and servers who 
want something which maximized stability, regardless of the cost and 
performance.
If you're selling a $5000 workstation, you might be willing to pay $300 
for a graphics card that saves you thousands in customer support calls 
that don't have to happen.
