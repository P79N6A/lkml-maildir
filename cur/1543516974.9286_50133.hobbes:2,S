Hi guys,
  I'm using happily emu10k1 driver with 2.2.13 kernel not meeting
  any problems. To have my ATI Rage 128 graphic supported I changed
  for 2.3.29 kernel (new framebuffer). I tried binary module from
  Creative web and then I compiled the newer one from the sources
  got from that web too. Both modules when loaded
  by "insmod emu10k1 -f" produce following error messages:
/lib/modules/2.3.29/misc/emu10k1.o: unresolved symbol request_region
/lib/modules/2.3.29/misc/emu10k1.o: unresolved symbol release_region
/lib/modules/2.3.29/misc/emu10k1.o: unresolved symbol __get_free_pages
/lib/modules/2.3.29/misc/emu10k1.o: unresolved symbol free_pages
/lib/modules/2.3.29/misc/emu10k1.o: unresolved symbol check_region
  I tried to grep kernel sources but haven't a clue about
  the solution. Everything goes well on 2.2.13, anyway.
  I could live with aty128fv patch for 2.2.x too :-)))
  I simply want to have sound and good refresh at the same time...
    Thanks for your tips,
      Ferda Prantl
