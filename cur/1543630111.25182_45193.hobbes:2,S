Well, you _could_ use the P bit on the segments and "page" them in on
demand with mmap. That would get you a model very similar to the old
16-big large model: no single object can be bigger than 2GB, but you can
have a total object size of something like 40 bits.
No kernel support needed, actually. It's all there with the LDT stuff.
But yes, compiler support and a recompiled glibc. And it would break all
programs that assume a flat address space.
And it would really _suck_ performance-wise if your working set is big
enough to cause you to have to switch mmap's a lot.
