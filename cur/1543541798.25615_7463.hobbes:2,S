Yes because the validity bits in word93 are not satisfied and then it gets
rejected.
So you can disable the check with a compile option.
So lets think for a minute.
We can not detect the 80c ribbon, thus we override that safety check.
We fail a valid bit check, thus we disable that safety check.
I can not think of any other stablity policy rules define, but I can find
a few more........
The point is you can destablize the driver, but that is what Linux is all
about........
You know I am getting tired of the game......
