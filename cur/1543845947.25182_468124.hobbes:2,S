It's pretty alright, and very hackish ;-)  I'll sign off on it,
but some comments...

I never tested any MSI-X, so maybe keep MSI-X disabled completely
for now?

Yep, that's the main problem with this code.  A sanity check to
make sure the number isn't >= 120 would be good, too.

I also had some code to show MSI IRQs as "MSI" instead of "EDGE"
in /proc/interrupts, maybe you want to add a generic version of
that?  Or maybe you have, and I judt didn't see it.

Lose the | 0x8000 part, that was an old experiment to work around
U3/U4 MPIC brokenness (and it didn't work).

It's best to do this in the platform code I think.
