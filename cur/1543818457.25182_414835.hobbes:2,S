OK.  A 12G file is around 3000 indirect blocks.  At 10 milliseconds each
I'd expect it to take 30-odd seconds.  A 14G swapfile here takes 20 second
for swapon.
Maybe your disks are slow, or the fs is already quite full+fragmented.
I guess the only thing I can suggest is that you force the swapfile to put
its indirect blocks close together.  You can do that by writing one byte
at each 4MB interval:
	creat(swapfile);
	for (i = 0; i < swapfile_size / 4MB; i++)
		pwrite(fd, "\0", 1, i * 4MB);
then fill in all the holes:
  dd if=/dev/zero of=swapfile bs=4MB count=swapfile_size/4MB conv=notrunc
rather kludgy, and hopefully ext3 reservations won't defeat it.
