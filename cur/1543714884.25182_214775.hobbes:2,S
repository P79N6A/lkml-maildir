Now I can use modprobe and then remove the module as many times as I want, but 
some a bit odd behavior appeared.  Some details are repeated from my original 
message:
Two 3c509 cards, a BNC/AUI one, configured with 3com's setup utility 
(3c5x9cfg.exe) to IRQ 9, port 0x210, and a RJ-45 one, configured to IRQ 5, 
port 0x300.  Both use non-pnp initalisation, and don't say anything if I do 
pnpdump.
Under Debian (kernel 2.4.22), the cards were probed IRQ 12 and 5, but ifconfig 
said IRQ 9 and 5 if I had told modprobe "irq=9,5", and both cards worked 
perfectly.
Under Gentoo, kernel 2.6.6-rc1 and your patch applied (I couldn't figure out 
how to correctly use patch, so I deleted the two lines in 3c509.c manually), 
the BNC card is found at IRQ 12 and RJ-45 card at IRQ 5 according 
to /var/log/messages.  And this is the same with every single run of insmod.
1. modprobe (or insmod) with no irq given:
eth0 doesn't come up, Device or resource busy
eth1 comes up with IRQ 5, port 0x300, and appears working
2. modprobe (or insmod) with irq=9,5 given:
eth0 comes up with IRQ _5_, port 0x210, and for some odd reason, works
eth1: Device or resource busy
3. same as the above, (irq=9,5) but eth1 up first
eth1 comes up with IRQ 5, port 0x300, and appears working
eth0: Device or resource busy
4. modprobe (or insmod) with irq=5,9 given:
both come up and work as expected
eth0 is IRQ 9, eth1 is IRQ 5
It is documented that the order of detection is arbitrary.  Both systems have 
the card at IRQ 9 (IRQ 12 in logs) always found first, but Gentoo (kernel 
2.6.6-rc1) needs irq=5,9 while Debian (vanilla kernel 2.4.22) needs irq=9,5.
Biggest thing left to understand is, why does the card work in try 2?  I know 
for sure that eth0 of try 2 is eth0 of try 3 (the BNC card), so we have 
different cards working there.
There is a network only at the BNC connector of one card, so by "appears 
working" I mean that the RJ-45 card comes up and generates interrupts, takes 
an IP address and transmits pings, but - as is expected - doesn't get any 
replies.
