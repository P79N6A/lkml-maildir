I saw the same problem with this 2.05.16 mpt driver. Now I also tried
upgrading to both the kernel-smp-2.6.5-1.326.i686.rpm from
http://people.redhat.com/arjanv/,
 and plain 2.6.6-rc1 kernel, and
these are also hanging with the same error:

btw: I also seem unable to send BREAK-t (or other magic sysrq
commands) via the serial console after this hang.. Maybe sysrq hasn't
been enabled that early in the boot, or the kernel is hanging too
hard..?
