IO to disks don't work for SOME disks, but some others are still Ok (I've
three SATA and two IDE).
Also, what is weird is the content of dmesg : after the nobody care, it looks
as if IRQ 23 is reuse for another device (SMBus), but /proc/interrupts still
reports it being used by libata.
I've been trying 2.6.23-rc5, and I'm still having this IRQ 23 nobody cared 
message.
Regards,
Paul
