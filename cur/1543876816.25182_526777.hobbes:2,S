Hi,
mbind(start, len, ...) currently requires that "start" be page-aligned,
but not "len" (which automatically gets page-rounded up).  This is a bit
odd:
- the userland type of start is void*, which people would expect to be a
  pointer to some variable.
- start needing to be page-aligned but len not needing to is not very
  consistent.
- none of this is documented in the manual page dated 2006-02-07
So one of those should probably be done to free people from headaches:
- document "start" requirement in the manual page
- require len to be aligned too, and document the requirements in the
  manual page
- drop the "start" requirement and just round down the page + adjust
  size automatically.
