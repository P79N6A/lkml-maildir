Can you go back to the Sharp source and confirm that these values should
be hardcoded in both the poodle and collie cases please? I know the
sharpsl_param code can provide them but I can't remember exactly which
models use which fields. I want to make sure this isn't a quick hack
John made before sharpsl_param was written :).
Thanks,
Richard
