Hi all,
Note: this bug isn't reproducable - but I have a generally unstable
system.  Can someone give me hints on this?  (more further down)
linux 2.2.9
I got a whole lot of Oops's when running chat (for initializing a ppp
connection):
 Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address

current->tss.cr3 = 00c43000, %cr3 = 00c43000

I looked inside sys_read ():
asmlinkage ssize_t sys_read(unsigned int fd, char * buf, size_t count)
{
        ssize_t ret;
        struct file * file;
        ssize_t (*read)(struct file *, char *, size_t, loff_t *);
        lock_kernel();
        ret = -EBADF;
        file = fget(fd);
        if (!file)
                goto bad_file;
        if (!(file->f_mode & FMODE_READ))
                goto out;
        ret = locks_verify_area(FLOCK_VERIFY_READ,
				file->f_dentry->d_inode,
                                file, file->f_pos, count);
<snip>
locks_verify_area dereferences file->f_dentry->d_inode.  But d_inode
is a weird number (0x0000063) - I determined this by disassembling the
code (file->f_dentry->d_inode is %edx).
So something's clobbering the f_dentry struct?  I can't reproduce the
bug (I'm on the net now ;-)
In general, I've had a very unstable system in the since 2.2.x (from
2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.5, 2.2.9)
One reproducable bug I need to investigate is I've written a program
that always crashes ALSA's OSS emulation...could be related (esound
is running at the same time as internet connection, so perhaps ALSA's
clobbering lots of things ???)
Any ideas?  What's a good way to hunt for this kind of bug?
I'm assuming that ALSA has write access to all of kernel-space (is this
correct?)
