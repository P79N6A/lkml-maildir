Trivial.
I think it's something similar to: ip cidr [enable|1] but it's been a
while and I don't have my hands on a Cisco manual atm.
Please take the time to learn what you talk about. <hands clue out> I
set up our Cisco 2501 to do this...um...3 years ago. On request. From
@Home, because without CIDR they were unreachable from us.
At my current job, we have subnets ranging from /31 to, um, at the
very least /22 (that's four IPs to 1024 IPs), possibly larger. Heck,
in the lab we've got /31, /26, and /23 subnets. And that's just off
the top of my head; I *think* we've got some /21 or /20 nets out there
but I'm not sure.
Oh, the /23 in our lab? 192.168.126.0-192.168.127.255. 
I could be off a bit in the netmask numbers; it's late, I spent way
too much time in meetings today.
