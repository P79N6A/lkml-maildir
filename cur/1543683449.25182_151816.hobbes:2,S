It just stopped the hang, which caused me to think I was onto something.
I will continue my debugging and take this to the pcmcia list,
so far with printk's and early returns I have got the following:
The ds_ioctl's are triggering the hang,
ioctl calls to DS_ADJUST_RESOURCE_INFO and DS_GET_STATUS work fine (all
others are quoted out and are not called before the hang )
But the first call to DS_VALIDATE_CIS causes the machine to hang.
I have tracked down the hang to 
pcmcia_get_first_tuple called from
pcmcia_validate_cis called from
ds_ioctl
in cistpl.c
Will narrow it down some more today.
PS. the card is:
Netgear 802.11b wireless PC card 16-bit PCMCIA MA401
( which works fine with 2.4.21 )
For you pcmcia ppl:

Any tips, known problem?
