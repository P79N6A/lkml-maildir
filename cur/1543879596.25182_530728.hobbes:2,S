No :(. I went through the locking again just now, but I can't see anything
wrong. Could you please enable CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING and CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCKDEP and
retest?
And also post stty -a -F /dev/ttyMIXX or a setup passed to
tcsetattr/ioctl(TCSETA/S) if available. What do you use for communication?
thanks,
