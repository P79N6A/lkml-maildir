One of the _advances_ on Unix is that files are just streams of bytes,
nothing more, nothing less. I did work with OSes with "records" and
"types of files", and they were just a royal pain.
One of the problems here is to assume that if
(a) some obscure OS does something differently,
(b) everybody else does it the Unix way today
then it has to be a good idea.  Many of the "good ideas" bandied around
have been tried before, and failed. Perhaps not miserably, but failed. The
Unix model has stood the test of time, and it has been almost universally
adopted, often junking other schemes. So there has to be _something_ in it
that is right...

But it is!

Very true. That's why you don't keep all your stuff in one big HOME file.

That's why Pascal added record (struct in C). The problem is that they are
programmer-defined, i.e. hard to shoehorn into one schema. Unix goes for
the lowest common denominator: Streams of bytes, you (programmer) impose
whatever structure you want. Not maximally confortable, but it works. And
does not need specialized tools for "copy a file of foo records" or such.
