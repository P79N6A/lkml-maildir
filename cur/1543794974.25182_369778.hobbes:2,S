Ok. Andrew added it to his queue, I guess I'll get my patch back that way ;)

I don't recognize those symptoms, so more info would be nice.
For example, it would be good to know where the threads are that are 
waiting uninterruptibly. You should be able to get that info with Sysrq

That should tell us if they're hung on a semaphore or waiting for disk IO 
to complete or what...
