Subject: Magic SysRq SAK does nothing on serial consoles

The SAK subfunction of the `magic SysRq key' feature does not do
anything when invoked on a serial console. It should.
I am running Linux 2.6.17.6 on a Soekris net4501, which is a machine
with no graphics card and just a (normal 8250) serial port. I am
using the serial port as the kernel's console. I also have
CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ enabled in my kernel configuration. When I
instruct my terminal to send a BREAK down the serial line and then
press Return, the kernel prints the SysRq menu, with one of the
options being `saK'. But if I send a BREAK and then press k, the
kernel prints `SysRq : SAK' and then does nothing further. No
processes are killed.
Investigation suggested that the problem might be that
sysrq_handle_SAK() in drivers/char/sysrq.c was not getting a tty
structure passed in, so that it did not know which tty to kill
processes associated with. So I traced the chain of calls leading to
that point, and ended up in include/linux/serial_core.h, where
uart_handle_sysrq_char() calls handle_sysrq() and does indeed pass
NULL as the third (struct tty *) parameter. The fix seemed simple:
instead of NULL it should pass the tty structure associated with the
serial port.
Applying the attached patch resolved the problem for me; now when I
send BREAK-k, the kernel prints `SysRq : SAK', then prints a couple
of lines indicating that some processes have been killed, and then
init spawns a new login process as I would expect.
(The patch is defensively coded, since I wasn't sure whether
port->info was guaranteeably non-NULL. If it is, the change can be
even simpler!)
This bug could be argued to have security implications. Suppose
somebody has written a program which imitates a login prompt, and
left it running on the serial port. I come along and send BREAK-k,
expecting it to kill any malicious programs and return me to a real
login prompt. The kernel prints `SysRq : SAK', indicating that it's
heard me and intends to perform the SAK function, and then I hit
Return and get what looks like a login prompt - but no processes
have been killed, so it's still the malicious imitation! I admit
that _now_ I wouldn't fall for this, since I've now seen the proper
SAK in action and I know that (a) it prints additional messages to
indicate what processes it's killing and (b) I would expect the
login prompt to return immediately afterwards without me having to
press Return; but I might have fallen for it if I'd tried this
before I knew there was a problem.
Some details of my hardware and software follow, as suggested in
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/lkml/reporting-bugs.html
 . I
think this problem is simple enough that most of this should be
unnecessary, but here it is anyway just in case.
Output of linux-2.6.17.6/scripts/ver_linux, on the machine on which
I built the kernel (which is not the same machine I saw the problem
on, because the net4501 is too slow for me to want to build a kernel
on it at all):

There is no /proc/scsi at all on the problem machine.
I also attach /proc/config.gz from the problem machine, in case it
contains any other important clues.
Finally, I apologise for sending this to the central Linux kernel
address instead of a particular maintainer. I looked through the
MAINTAINERS file and found a variety of people responsible for
particular serial drivers, but couldn't find anyone specifically
responsible for general cross-driver serial functionality. I hope
this report can find its way to the right person.
Cheers,
Simon
