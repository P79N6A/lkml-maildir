What if user does cat /dev/hda1>/dev/null on mounted device while
filesystem driver does getblk? ... the buffer gets corrupted.
User:				Filesystem driver:
--------------------------------------------------------
open("/dev/hda1", O_RDONLY);
read();
waiting for io completion...
				getblk();
				mark_buffer_uptodate();
				write_some_data_there
read data is stored, end_request()
				BOOM! changes are lost.
