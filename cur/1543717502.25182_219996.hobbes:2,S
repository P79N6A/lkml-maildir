The official kernel does not have vdso randomization.  Ingo has a patch
for the Red Hat kernel which is used in the FC2 kernel.  The patch
effectively only changes the location at which the vdso is mapped.  It
does not change the vdso content.  So the __kernel_vsyscall symbol in
the vdso's symbol table is not changed.
AT_SYSINFO is the right way to go forward but it is not directly
accessible to userlevel code.  And it is no pointer which will make
architectures with function descriptors unhappy.
