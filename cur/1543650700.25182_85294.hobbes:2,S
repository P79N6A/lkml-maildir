There have been numerous requests by both vendors and indviduals to have 
this and the hr-timers patches added.  There has also been discussion and 
testing, followed by refinements.  I know you don't find it useful, but 
there are those of us out there who do.  For scientific research and 
experimentation, these patches would be of great benefit as having greater 
precision is always a good thing.  Please apply these patches.
Cheers,
Nicholas
