Paulo,
    Thanks for responding.  You are right in that the state of memory 
isn't the state of the entire machine; however, for instance, the 
swsusp2 project can save the contents of memory out to disk, go to 
sleep, and then resume to it later.  Basically, what I am trying to do 
is something like swsusp2, with less restrictions; I know I have another 
region the size of physical memory to work with, I know I am executing 
from an interrupt handler, and at the end I don't want to go to sleep, 
just continue on.  Then I might want to use that memory image later.
Thanks,
Chris Lalancette
