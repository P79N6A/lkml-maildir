That was the reason I removed the function because it is no longer used
with demand paging.

This portion is incorrect, because it will trigger BUG_ON all the time
for faulting hugetlb page.
Yes, killing follow_hugetlb_page() is safe because follow_page() takes
care of hugetlb page.  See 2nd patch posted earlier in
