Do you encrypt before the data has hit the data journal or after? Does that
work for mmap etc?

This sounds like something you might want to abstract into a generic
architecture to be shared with the loop device code, or anything which might
need encryption in the kernel. Otherwise it is a PITA to maintain.
And I thought some of those algorithms were strictly signature / hash
algorithms, but you never stop learning ;-)
