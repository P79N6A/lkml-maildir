The kernel is also missing the logic for controlling which VGA card is
active when multiple ones exist in the same box.

When I say dropped, I mean drop the feature of having multiple drivers
simultaneously open by the VT layer. You would still be able to switch
from vgacon to fbcon by using sysfs. You just wouldn't be able to use
VT swap hotkeys between them.
