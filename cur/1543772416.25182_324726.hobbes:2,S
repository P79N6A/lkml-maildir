Hello Kylie,
2.6.12-rc6-mm1 with the additional PCI IDs gives the following
debugging output (I have added some and made the driver ignore the wrong
SID INDEX):
	tpm_nsc 0000:00:1f.0: NSC TPM base=0xffff
	tpm_nsc 0000:00:1f.0: NSC TPM SID INDEX 0xff
	tpm_nsc 0000:00:1f.0: NSC TPM detected
	tpm_nsc 0000:00:1f.0: NSC LDN 0xff, SID 0xff, SRID 0xff
	tpm_nsc 0000:00:1f.0: NSC SIOCF1 0xff SIOCF5 0xff SIOCF6 0xff SIOCF8 0xff
	tpm_nsc 0000:00:1f.0: NSC IO Base0 0xffff
	tpm_nsc 0000:00:1f.0: NSC IO Base1 0xffff
	tpm_nsc 0000:00:1f.0: NSC Interrupt number and wakeup 0xff
	tpm_nsc 0000:00:1f.0: NSC IRQ type select 0xff
	tpm_nsc 0000:00:1f.0: NSC DMA channel select0 0xff, select1 0xff
	tpm_nsc 0000:00:1f.0: NSC Config 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff
	tpm_nsc 0000:00:1f.0: NSC PC21100 TPM revision 31
If can be of further assistance tracking down the problem, please let me
know.
Best Regards
Jens
