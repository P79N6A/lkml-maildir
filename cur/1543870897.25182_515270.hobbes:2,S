This fixes the problem. After a lot of rebooting
and testing the problem is definitely gone when this
check is patched out and the ACPI timer override is
ignored. It looks like there should be a cleaner
patch than just obliterating the condition and return
though.
Perhaps the code should remain as is and
"acpi_use_timer_override" could be complimented
by exposing the "acpi_skip_timer_override" option to
the kernel command line?
This seems to have been exposed in the past:
