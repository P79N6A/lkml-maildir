Im running a couple of CyrixIII boxes. One on an A/Open MX3S (early rev[1])
which works very nicely and the other a Gigabyte GAJR4. I've not observed any

Check the CPU isnt overheating. Most processors will drop their clock if
they get an overheat. Not that it should be easy to get a CyrixIII to overheat
The Cyrix howto won't help you. The VIA C3 is in fact an IDT winchip derivative.

[1] The later MX3S boards seem badly screwy with all cpus - or I got bad boards
but those went back.
