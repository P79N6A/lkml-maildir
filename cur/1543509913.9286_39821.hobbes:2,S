Yes, that's probably going to be reasonably useful. Some programs may
do lots of internal computations and crash somewhere in the middle,
leaving an strace useless as to where the crash happened. A program
like smbmount interacts with its environment through system calls, and
you'll be able to almost deduce the line number where it died from the
strace.
