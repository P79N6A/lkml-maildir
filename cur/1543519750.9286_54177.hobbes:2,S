   I'd give the credit to Nathan;  it's not his code, but he mentioned
   the addr->pfn stuff to me, and if you saw it in my patch it's because
   of that.

   Nathan and I are both beating away at the memory detect stuff (well,
   I am;  his patchsuite covers a lot of ground and I'm simply merging
   the parts of his patch that overlaps my memory detection code) and
   I think that we might have an Even Better Mousetrap as soon as I can
   get 2.3.33 to actually load on the Ppro200 I'm building it on today :-(

   david parsons \bi/ Not 2.3.33 + memory patches.  No.  2.3.33 by itself,
                  \/      with gcc 2.7.2.3 and binutils 2.9.1.0.15.  Sigh.
