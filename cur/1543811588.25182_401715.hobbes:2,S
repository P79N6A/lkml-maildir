I think from 10,000 feet the form is about right.
I like the namespace nomenclature.  (It can be shorted to _space  or _ns).
In part because it shortens well, and in part because it emphasizes that
we are *just* dealing with the names.
You split the resolution at just ipc_msgs.  When I really think it should
be everything ipcs deals with.
Performing the assignment inside the tasklist_lock is not something we
want to do in do_fork().
So it looks like a good start.  There are a lot of details yet to be filled
in, proc, sysctl, cleanup on namespace release.  (We can still provide
the create destroy methods even if we don't hook the up).
I think in this case I would put the actual namespace structure
definition in util.h, and just put a struct ipc_ns in sched.h.
sysvipc is isolated enough that nothing outside of the ipc/
directory needs to know the implementation details.
It probably makes sense to have a statically structure and
to set the pointer initially in init_task.h
Until we reach the point where we can multiple instances that
even removes the need to have a pointer copy in do_fork()
as that happens already as part of the structure copy.
