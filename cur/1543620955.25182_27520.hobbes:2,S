Yes.  Cache bits are in the page tables, and it would be idiotic to
manipulate the cache bits on a 1MB granularity over the kernel
direct mapped space.

GFP_KERNEL in the page table allocation functions mainly.  We've been
around and around this recently on this mailing list, so I'm not going
to say anything further.  I don't want another long discussion about
this subject taking my time away from doing real work on ARM.  If you're
really interested in the outcome, please examine the lkml archives.
