I get this with my ATAPI drive (2.2.14pre18):
hdd: 98288kB, 196576 blocks, 512 sector size
hdd: 98304kB, 96/64/32 CHS, 4096 kBps, 512 sector size, 2941 rpm
hdd: The drive reports both 100663296 and 100646912 bytes as its capacity
 hdd: unknown partition table
$ mount |grep zip
/dev/hdd on /zip type ext2 (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,user=bridgett)
The reason it's /dev/hdd is that on another computer I have a parallel port
Zip drive and over there I mount /dev/sda1.   The ATAPI drives are supposed
to come with a jumper to stop them from skipping over the partition table,
but mine (IBM OEM) didn't :-(
