It's a fresh RedHat 6.2 install with egcs 1.1.2. I have a Bay GA620
gig ethernet card, the onboard eepro 100, an unused dual symbios scsi
onboard. The machine wasn't in X when this occurs, just a few ssh
sessions, some netatalk apple file sharing, and Oracle 8.1.5.
I checked a ps alx when it was last hanging and it was wait_on something
Forgot about the n option, so I'll try to crash it again.
