If you want, grab the Interphase 5526 Fibre Channel Driver off of our
Web Site (
http://www.iphase.com/~linux
) and see the technique I used. 
It uses a combination of ioctls and the proc filesystem for feedback.
As you probably know it uses the HP (now Agilent Technologies) Tachyon chip :)
Qlogics drivers typically use onboard Flash Rom for peristent configuration
storage.
