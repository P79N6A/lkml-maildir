Config options are evil. Adding them is a bad form of bloat.
Whatever you want to do, there are many ways to do it without
changing this part of the kernel code. After all, any partition
is just part of the entire disk.
Note that there are aliasing problems - it is bad to access data
both via a file system and via raw disk or partition.
