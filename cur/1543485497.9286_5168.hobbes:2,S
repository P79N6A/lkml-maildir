the question is, does after this 'first interrupt' your card work OK,
(without using the asm)? If yes then somehow we managed to miss the first
IRQ. If not then the card does not really produce interrupts. 
the asm just simulates an interrupt received externally. (the simulation
is not perfect but adequate for most purposes)
