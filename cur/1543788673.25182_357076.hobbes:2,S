If they all use the same on disk formats as their basic structure, fsck 
should not return gt > 1 due to misinterpreting reiser on-disk 
structures. It should say "oh not one of mine, skipping". Instead it 
returns an error claiming massive corruption, and halts the system. I 
just upgraded my wifes computer from Suse to RedHat FC4 and when it hits 
the reiser partitions, the whole system explodes due to fsck.ext3 
misrecognizing reiser partitions. I had to modify rc.sysinit and blank 
the partitions with fdisk to get it to install. After it installed, I 
recreated the partitions (after writing down what they were in the first 
place for block #'s etc.) and disabled rc.sysinit checks. This is 
busted. Hans needs to fix fsck.ext3 and submit a patch or redhat does.
