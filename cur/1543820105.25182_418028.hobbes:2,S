It was not so much a suggestion, but a misinterpretation of your patch. I 
am also undecided and slightly negative about it.

I talked to Paul about this, and was not only slightly negative about it. 
The suggestion was to either use native versions of Tk (which might or 
might not fix it), or fix Tk.
Having spent already some time with this workaround, I am not willing to 
invest more of it, though.
So, if people want to do something about this patch, go wild.
Ciao,
