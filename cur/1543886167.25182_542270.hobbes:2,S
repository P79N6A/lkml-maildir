I feel I ought to explain why it's ended up in this state.
This is not a new patch.  It's been in -mm since 2.6.21-rc2-mm1 (at least)
and we hoped to have the selective freezing of the system for different events
done before the 2.6.22 merging window would open.  It didn't happen, mainly
for reasons that we couldn't control, and now we have some patches that
depend on this one and are more urgent, since they're needed to fix some bugs.
