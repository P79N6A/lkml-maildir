Whilst they can't both run at the same time, it's perfectly possible
(and useful) to build a kernel with both included. ACPI will quit
if APM is already running, so booting with apm=off turns the same
kernel into 'ACPI mode'
Quite useful for me right now, as currently my Vaio won't boot
an ACPI kernel if its on mains power for some reason. 8-)
