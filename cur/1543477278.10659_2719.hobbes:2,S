If they can alter init from a tmp race, and have console access to the
system, then you have bigger problems.
On a system where this kind of security is a concern (what? a kiosk in a
'cracker' bar?), you can take the 1/2 second to remove the call from the
kernel yourself (or send me nice mail to send you a patch if you can't do
it yourself).
