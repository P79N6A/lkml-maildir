I just dropped it. Gcc 3.0 and 3.1 are so old that we simply don't care. 
Nobody who has compiled a kernel in the last two years can possibly have 
those versions: we've failed the build on them since December 2006. And 
there obviously won't be any new users either. So consider it a 
generational garbage collection event.
Of course, if we really want to check for old compiler versions, we can 
add the check back (to the gcc3 header file where it belongs), but it does 
seem to be entirely historical.
