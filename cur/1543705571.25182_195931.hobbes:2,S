Ok, was just thinking it could lead to confusion with debug usually not
compiled in.  Maybe a more visible error (as we then know it was outside
the kernel)?

Hmm, Ok, it seems it is much better on batch jobs (or if udevd is
running) then from clean start, sorry.

Script is attached.  If I was being silly here, let me know.  Some
quick testing again, it seems like the missing events is more with
the echo not commented, but could be just some fluke (there was
still however more than 5 usually missing).
