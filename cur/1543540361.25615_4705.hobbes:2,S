yup. Freshmeat has:
http://freshmeat.net/appindex/1999/09/04/936483800.html
which links to the home page:
http://www.tuebingen.linux.de/~s-kod1/noflushd/
Note you cannot currently build the RPM as user since it has install -o
root somewhere in its Makefile. If you dare, rpm --rebuild as root,
else, fix the Makefile or wait for the update. I have contacted Daniel
Kobras about this (noflushd maintainer) and he agreed to use %defattr in
the RPM .spec in the next release rather than using -o/-g root on
$(INSTALL). Daniel is not an RPM expert, he's using Debian.
Also note I'm Bcc:'ing Daniel. It's not really blind cc: this way, but
this prevents him from being drawn into a possible continued discussion.
I see many people with improperly configured mailers or mailers without
mailing list support that have this tendency (of drawing people in).
Let's please take this off the list. I'm setting Reply-To:, but I'm not
sure if it makes it through the list software.
