Last night my laptop suffered an oops during closedown.  The full oops
reports can be downloaded from
  
http://www.atrad.com.au/~jwoithe/xfs_oops/
as photos of the screen.  Since the laptop was unusable at this point I
wasn't able to cut and paste the details, and they weren't in the logs when
the machine was rebooted.
The initial complaint claims to be an "invalid opcode".  Is this possibly a
memory fault developing or does it ring any bells for anyone?  memtest86
finds no fault with the memory.
Kernel version was kernel.org 2.6.23.9 compiled as a low latency desktop. 
The RT patches were not applied.
