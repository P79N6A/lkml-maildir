Any strong reason why not? x has some value that does not make sense and can create only problems.
And as I explained, it can result in longer code too. So, why keep this value around. Why not
re-initialize it to NULL.
If x should not be re-initialized to NULL, then by the same logic, we should not even initialize
local variables. And all of us know that local variables should be initialized.
I would like to know a good reason as to why x should not be set to NULL.
