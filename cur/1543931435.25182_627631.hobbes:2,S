BTW that was my home desktop. I just noticed that my work desktop gives out
significantly different results.
vendor_id       : GenuineIntel
cpu family      : 6
model           : 15
model name      : Intel(R) Core(TM)2 CPU          6700  @ 2.66GHz
stepping        : 6
cpu MHz         : 2667.000
cycles: out 4263, in 2487
cpu MHz         : 1600.000
cycles: out 4391, in 2623
There seems to be more variation in the results between runs on this system
too. I suppose the difference must be up to the chipset.
My home system:
00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation 82P965/G965 Memory Controller Hub (rev 02)
00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation 82801HB/HR (ICH8/R) LPC Interface Controller (rev 02)
My work system:
00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation 82975X Memory Controller Hub
00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corporation 82801GB/GR (ICH7 Family) LPC Interface Bridge (rev 01)
