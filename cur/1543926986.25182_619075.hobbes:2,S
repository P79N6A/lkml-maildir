I removed the 'struct semaphore' completely from my driver, using real
mutexes now instead, replace the signalling semaphores by 'struct
completion' mechanisms and got rid of the possible race I saw with the
completions in a different way, and now the problem is completely
gone!
Posix Signals work properly now (no OOPS anymore), so the problem was
likely related to the way I used the 'struct semaphore' types, which
is thus different compared to the non-RT kernel and therefor quite
confusing.
So, thank you (and Daniel) for pointing me into the right direction.
Now lets get rid of the 'struct semaphore' completely in the kernel :-))
Kind Regards,
Remy Bohmer
