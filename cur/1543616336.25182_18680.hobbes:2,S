Since you have to change all the drivers anyway, I'd prefer if
_tty_make_name() was left unchanged, and instead you put the "%d" in
each driver.name, thusly:
#ifdef CONFIG_DEVFS_FS
	wod_driver.name = "tts/N%d";
#else
	wod_driver.name = "ttyN%d";
#endif
The reason: maximum flexibility in the kinds of names we can
support. If for some reason we want a name like "tts/N%d_A" and
"tts/N%d_B" (say a driver with linked ttys, like the pty driver), we
don't need to make a global change.
