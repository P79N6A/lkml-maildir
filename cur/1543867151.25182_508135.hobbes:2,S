Hello Tejun,
I've tested your patch yesterday, but no luck, I can't find any difference
in the resulting boot log.
Please find attached an archive containing :
 - dmesg.2.6.20-rc7 : full dmesg with stock kernel
 - dmesg.patch : full dmesg with your patch included.
I've also added a lspci -vvv, a cat /proc/interrupts and a cat /proc/ioports
in case this could help.
Also, please note that libata is complaining :
ATA: abnormal status 0x7F on port 0x177
and later :
ATA: abnormal status 0x7F on port 0x9807
I don't know if this is important or not.
Sorry for the bad news, 
Regards,
Paul
