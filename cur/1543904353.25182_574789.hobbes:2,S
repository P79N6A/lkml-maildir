If we were starting fresh, I think the best way would be for the IR
driver to claim the whole PNP device, which typically has two I/O port
ranges, like this:
  00:03 SMCf010 SMC Fast Infrared Port
    state = active
        io 0x3e8-0x3ef
        io 0x100-0x10f
        irq 3
        dma 3
There could be an ioctl or equivalent to request SIR mode, and the
IR driver could use serial8250_register_port() when entering SIR
mode and serial8250_unregister_port() when leaving.
The IR driver would be the clear owner of the entire device.  Of course,
this still only works if we get rid of the 8250 blind probe for 0x3e8
or figure out some API for the IR driver to tell the 8250 driver to get
its mitts off.
