Though it would be nice to be able to strace init too...

It is strange. After logout it always comes up after 10 seconds delay in first
agetty run expires. Only on first start some of them need more than one attempt
to come up.
Do not you start some multithreaded daemons from shell which gets later
'stuck'? Maybe that controlling terminal handling is not 100% yet. Do not
some daemons "randomly" disappear since you use vhangup in agetty? ;-) AFAIK
controlling terminal is not available through /proc :-(
