"dmesage file"? You mean, "/var/log/dmesg"? No, thats not the file you want...
At least here, that file contains the logs as they were when the boot finishes.
The information you want can be retrieved by running the command (actual program
to run, type it in a terminal) "dmesg".
Or you might be able to look whats in the end of the /var/log/messages file, if
you have one.
