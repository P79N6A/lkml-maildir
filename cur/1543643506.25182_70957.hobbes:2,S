OK, I've worked out what was wrong (patch below): /proc/bus/usb was
being unmounted by the hotplug/usb.rc script.  After loading a HCD, usb.rc
executes the following lines:
    if [ -d /proc/bus/usb ]; then
        # If we see there are no busses, we "failed" and
        # can report so even if we're partially nonmodular.
        COUNT=`ls /proc/bus/usb | wc -l`
        if [ $COUNT -le 2 ]; then
            umount /proc/bus/usb
            rmmod usbcore >/dev/null 2>&1
            return 1
        fi
In the 2.4 kernels, /proc/bus/usb contains at least
001  devices  drivers
i.e. at least three entries.  However sometime during
the 2.5 kernel series the drivers file went away.  So
now there are only two entries and usb.rc unmounts
/proc/bus/usb.
A simple fix is to change the test to [ $COUNT -lt 2 ];
Duncan.
