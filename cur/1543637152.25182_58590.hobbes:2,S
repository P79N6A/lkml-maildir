I disagree. As it stands, NLM_NEVER == (~(unsigned long)0), and "when"
is unsigned long, so the only thing we need to protect against is if
we hit the 'magic value' NLM_NEVER. Note that the time_before_eq()
comparison ensures that we cope well with jiffy wraparound etc, so the
entry should *not* in fact get put at the end of the list as you
claimed.
With the above change (plus your change to set NLM_NEVER=0x7fffffff),
we end up never retrying locks that just happen to have been put on
the list at a time when the value of 'jiffies' happens to be > 0x7fffffff.

The other fix for fs/locks.c looks reasonable AFAICS (but perhaps
Matthew wants to take a look?)
-
Concerning the fix implementing GRANTED_RES: I fully agree we need
it. I've just never had the time, and it's the sort of thing that
the Connectathon tests don't keep nagging at you with ;-)...
Patrice Dumas recently did some work on implementing this both for
NLMv1,2,3 and NLM4, so I was planning on integrating his changes into
2.4.20.
Cheers,
  Trond
