For those still following the RT debate, here's an example deployment
(albeit proprietary) of the nanokernel approach:

rtai-fusion, which relies on the nanokernel/hypervisor approach, is
an open source substitute to the above. It was designed to provide
RTOS skins (posix, VxWorks, pSOS, uITRON, VRTX) on top of an
rt-nucleus, all of which runs side-by-side with Linux.
customary warning: none of this precludes coexistence with rt-preempt.
