	Jumping isn't always the solution.  The new patch, while better
than the first, still calls mutex_unlock() in two places.  The following
patch keeps it all in one code path, and keeps all dentry modification
underneath a single mutex_lock()/unlock() pair.  What do you think?  I'm
building it to test as we speak.
