You plan to remove the network stack from the kernel when then?  X is
in user space for some rather strange values of userspace[1] for
historical and political reasons, not technical ones.  When
performance raises its ugly head and you end up having to listen to
engineers again you end up with DRI and that:
Module                  Size  Used by
nvidia               3464380  12 
X is a beautiful example of how things should not have been done.  Its
only redeeming quality is that it exists and works, and that's
definitively a non-negligible one.

You seem to be missing the point that the entire reason why OSS is
important is that it isn't a library.
  OG.
[1] Direct hardware access, DMA, pci enumeration, hardware
    reconfiguration, what a beautiful userspace we have there.
