It assumes more than that. It assumes that a secctx will be
interpreted exactly the same way on both the client and the server.
On an old style MLS machine, where the label was encoded in a
data structure, this was usually a reasonable assumption, but
even then not always. Given that there is no reason to expect that
the policy on the server will match that on the client it looks
to me like you've got a day one exposure. It doesn't matter that
the LSM is the same on both ends, that's one of Trond's arguements
that I've just accepted. You have no reason to expect
interoperability even with SELinux on both ends unless you can
somehow make statements about the relative values of the secctx
on the two machines. This applies to Smack just as strongly as
it does to SELinux, so it appears the scheme is flawwed in general,
not just in the SELinux case.
I hope that's clear and specific enough. Let me know if I'm
missing something.

The iteritive development model has it's advantages.
Thank you.
