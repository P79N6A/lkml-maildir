"data-dependency barrier" would be better, assuming you mean a barrier
enforcing a data dependency. If you say "data dependency barrier" you
could also mean a "dependency barrier" implemented as a piece of data,
for instance, like a flag value in a data stream that forces
synchronization with another data stream.
