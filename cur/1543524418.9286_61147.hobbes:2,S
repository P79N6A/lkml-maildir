Hi!
This a new version of the previously sent patch.
The news:
- I introduced simple_strto[u]ll() in vsprintf.c, so
  mtrr_write() is as simple as the original and works the same.
  (Maybe other drivers will need these functions, too.)
- I tried to avoid using 64 bit numbers where possible.
The patch is against 2.3.41 and I am still waiting for
test reports on AMD, Cyrix and Centaur CPUs.
Regards,
Zoltan Boszormenyi
