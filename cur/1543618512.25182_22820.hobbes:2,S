Sorry here it is. Its excatly what I described in my initial posting and very 
simple and only raises the limit of unnamed_dev_in_use:

If you apply this patch as well as andis patch the system then is capable of 
mounting up to 4096 NFS dirs. I tested this and it worked without problems. 
The only thing I noticed is that the automounter needs quite a long time 
(several seconds) do exire such a mass of mounts. But this is only a 
performance issue.

Andis patch together with my small modification has still some problems you 
Pete already solved. On the other hand it has the advantage, that you can 
mount a very high number only limited by the bitmap unnamed_dev_in_use of NFS 
directories. The problems are:
1. You cannot start NFSD on a host patched with the above patches. So you 
cannot mount  an exported directory on  another linux box. Since you and 
Trond already described why this happend in Petes first patch it should be 
possible to  fix this.
2. You cannot NFS mount any filesystem exported by this host, since andis 
patch does not include a mount option to select either secure/non secure 
port. Since a "normal" kernel linux NFS Client wants always a secure port 
mounting is impossible. 
3. You cannot NFS mount from another linux box, again this happend since 
there is no mount option that would allow to say that only secure ports 
should be used. 
So I think if it would be possible to include the mount option "nores" like 
Pete did but now in andis patch as well as a patch so nfsd will run again, 
andis solution has the big adavantage of beeing able to mount more than 1279  
NFS directories. 
This was the reason why I was interested to know if there is a major 
drawback, if you simply do not use more major devices like Pete's patch does. 
If there are none, than I would propose to drop the use of new major devices.
Thanks Rainer
