Yes, it is an optimization, nothing more.  Either code will behave the
same, but one version might be a little faster, depending on the cpu,
unless the compiler is already clever enough to do this himself.
Just wrote a small test program with both variants and tested on i386
with gcc 3.2.3 and 2.95.4, with -O2 and -Os.  The code generated was
identical in all eight cases.  So if ever this zero optimization
reduces readability of the code, write a patch and make it better.
Beats any spelling fixes.
