The SR-IOV is a very straightforward capability -- it can only reside in
the Physical Function's (the real device) config space and controls the
allocation of the Virtual Function by several registers. What we can do
in the PCI layer is to make the SR-IOV device spawn VF upon user request,
and register VF to the PCI core. The functionality of SR-IOV device (both
the PF and VF) can vary at a large range and their drivers (same as normal
PCI device driver) are responsible for handling device specific stuff.
So it looks like we can get all work done in the PCI layer with only two
interfaces: one for the PF driver to register itself as a SR-IOV capable
driver, expose the sysfs (or ioctl) interface to receive user request, and
allocate 'pci_dev' for VF; another one to cleanup all stuff when the PF
driver unregisters itself (e.g., the driver is removed or the device is
going to power-saving mode.).

Yes, using a PF driver to evaluate the SR-IOV core is necessary. And only
the PF driver can use the interface since the VF shouldn't have the SR-IOV
capability in its config space according to the spec.
