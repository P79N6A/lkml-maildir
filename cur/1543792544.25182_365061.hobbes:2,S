I agree with you about that one.  It's yet another thing for C
programmers to have to learn to watch for C++ doing behind your back.
However, it isn't any worse than having an ordinary C pointer to some
struct.  If the pointer was passed to the current function from above,
and you're passing it to another function below, you really don't know
what's going to happen to the structure unless you go look.  Just like
the C++ reference, the C pointer doesn't get an address-of operator to
remind you.
