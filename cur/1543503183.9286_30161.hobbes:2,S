My experience is that the above does not work, and I would recommend
moving the modem on COM4 to use either IRQ5 or IRQ2/9 (whichever is
free). That's what I've done here, and it fixed all the problems.

You should be using ttyS1 and ttyS3 rather than cua1 and cua3 since
the latter are no longer supported.

My experience has been that IRQ sharing doesn't work with modems at
all, and very rarely works with ISA bus cards when sharing between
different cards, so in this context, you probably can't.
Best wishes from Riley.
