That's OK if they stay tiny and don't grow as time passes by.

That's OK if it isn't forgotten to un-inline them when they get more 
callers.
Unfortunately, people often don't check whether an "inline" is still 
appropriate when the code evolves.
Unless this is an extreme hot path, it's therefore IMHO not a good idea 
to use "inline" in such cases.
Additionally, it's a medium-term goal for me to re-enable unit-at-a-time 
on i386 for recent gcc's.

I didn't had one specific example in mind, but yes this seems to be an 
example for inline's that might have been reasonable at one time in the 
past, but are no longer today.

"make checkstack" tells that nfsd_vfs_write is below 100 bytes of stack 
usage. So even calling 30 such functions would not get you above
3 kB stack usage.
It's also interesting that according to Jörn Engel's static analysis of 
call paths in kernel 2.6.11 [1], the string "nfs" does occur in neither 
any of the functions involved in call paths with > 2 kB stack usage, nor 
in any recursive call paths.
It's OK to use some bytes from the stack, and you haven't yet convinced 
me that the code you are responsible for is using too much stack.  ;-)
