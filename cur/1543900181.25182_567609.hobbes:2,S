Thanks, I have modified the test program blocking the signals for the
duration of the signal handler as follows:
#include <signal.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#define SIG_RAND (SIGRTMIN + rand() % (SIGRTMAX - SIGRTMIN + 1))
#define NUMSIG 7
struct {
	int sig, num;
} seq[NUMSIG];
void sh(int sig, siginfo_t *info, void *unused)
{
	static int cnt;
	seq[cnt].num = info->si_value.sival_int;
	seq[cnt++].sig = sig;
}
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	int i;
	pid_t p = getpid();
	struct sigaction sa;
	sigset_t ss, ssold;
	union sigval sv;
	sigemptyset(&ss);
	for (i = SIGRTMIN; i <= SIGRTMAX; i++) {
		sa.sa_sigaction = sh;
		sa.sa_flags = SA_SIGINFO;
		sigfillset(&sa.sa_mask);
		sigaction(i, &sa, NULL);
		sigaddset(&ss, i);
	}
	sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &ss, &ssold);
	switch (fork()) {
		case -1:
			perror("fork()");
			return 1;
		case 0:
			srand(time(NULL));
			for (i = 0; i < NUMSIG; i++) {
				sv.sival_int = i;
				sigqueue(p, SIG_RAND, sv);
			}
			return 0;
		default:
			wait(NULL);
	}
	sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &ssold, NULL);
	for (i = 0; i < NUMSIG; i++)
		printf("SIGRTMIN + %2d, sent with number %d\n",
			seq[i].sig - SIGRTMIN, seq[i].num);
	return 0;
}
This modified program works correctly with the original kernel:
SIGRTMIN +  2, sent with number 5
SIGRTMIN +  3, sent with number 2
SIGRTMIN + 10, sent with number 6
SIGRTMIN + 16, sent with number 3
SIGRTMIN + 17, sent with number 4
SIGRTMIN + 18, sent with number 0
SIGRTMIN + 29, sent with number 1
I would like to explain why I got an impression the next_signal()
funtion did not work correctly. When I ran the old test program using a
vendor-specific heavily patched kernel the signals order was as the
POSIX standard specified. Another kernel, which was closer to the
vanilla kernel, did not show the expected behavior. Instead, the signals
were handled in the reversed order.
Sorry for making noise in the mailing list.
