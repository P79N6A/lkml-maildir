Sure it does - it just needs to do it in the bootloader, not the kernel. You 
haven't eliminated the problem - or made it any easier to debug - it is just 
moved somewhere else. Again - this is not bad. We decided/are attempting to 
do it in the kernel. Normally what we find is there are more kernel people on 
a project than bootloader (whether this makes this easier - or not - is still 
TDB :)

Absolutely - the problem that everyone is trying to solve - is how to do plug 
and play, with no enumeration?
Doing it early in the bootloader is akin to historical PC solution where early 
ISA PNP (shudder) filled out a table in memory, and passed it to the OS.

When the kernel engineer runs into a problem because a driver won't load, is 
it better that he can fix it himself (hopefully), or that they have to call 
the person maintaining the bootloader? There are pro/cons of either. I can 
see the value in both. 
We choose to do it in the driver, not the bootloader.

I don't think we are putting board specific code in drivers (or if there is - 
it should get removed).
I did a quick look, and the only place this has happened is in some of our 
drivers that have not made it to main line yet - where we accidently put some 
mtd_partitions in the drivers, rather than the boards file. I know we are 
working on fixing this.

I agree - which is why don't do this either. Board specific info does not go 
into drivers. I think this is something that Michael, Bryan and others 
working on the Blackfin arch & drivers will agree to 100%.
What we do is try to make the driver agnostic to the hardware as much as 
possible, where hardware specifics (chip selects, IRQ, GPIO, etc) are managed 
in Kconfig.
I can see the value of doing the initialisation in the bootloader - since this 
would allow you have a common driver - and hardware customisation is done in 
the bootloader.

We have been trying to minimise that - and I think we have been doing a pretty 
good job. There doesn't seem to be any platform specific ifdefs in our 
drivers that are not abstracted out.

We have lots of end users (obviously not as many as ARM or PPC yet), and they 
have not been complaining, in fact some say that this is easier to deploy.
But - I think we both agree - that what we are doing is just an alternative 
implemention of hardware abstraction - that is different than the way that 
some others are doing it. Not better/worse (from what I can tell) - it just 
has different tradeoffs.
