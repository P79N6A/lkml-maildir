Fortunately, he's got help now:

If I got the impression that Kai was actually trying to work with the team,
I'd thank him for that.  He appears to be doing just the opposite, and I
stand by my comment that that is divisive.  He could accomplish the same
thing result he wants - patching up old kbuild - and bring parts of kbuild
2.5 into the tree, reducing the size of that patch *at the same time*,
instead of (apparently) trying to marginalize that work.  That is what I'd
call cooperation.
We have a perfect - and rare - situation here where the two can coexist in
the same tree, and may the best and fastest eventually predominate.  Let's
take advantage of that: let's have both in parallel for a while.
