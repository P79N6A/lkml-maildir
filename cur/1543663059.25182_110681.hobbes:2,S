Subject: why is "scripts/elfconfig.h" not removed with "make mrproper"?

  i just verified that the original 2.5.62 kernel tree does not
start with the header file "scripts/elfconfig.h".  this file is
created by running "make xconfig", even when nothing is configured.
but that file is *not* removed by running "make mrproper", which
i would think it should be.
  won't this cause a problem when generating patches, since
that elfconfig.h file will show up every time?
