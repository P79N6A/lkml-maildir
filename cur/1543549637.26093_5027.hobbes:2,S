So what? For platforms which have a nice easy way to stick ASCII on
screen, use this. For other platforms, find some other approach - if you
have a nice easy serial port handy, try feeding the characters there.
This feature doesn't need to work identically on all platforms. It doesn't
even need to work on all platforms (although that would be nice).
