Okay, I used the "targeted revert" method instead of "git-bisect",
and nailed it in one try by reverting these two commits by Alan Stern:
7ed92f1a149dddc3cb537ccd7441e98adac12c3e USB: make the autosuspend workqueue thread freezable
ef7f6c7084b333c7524dcd297e0578d43733a2a2 USB: more autosuspend timer stuff
I yanked them both, as they appeared to be releated based on the titles.
Reverting this pair of commits fixes the USB suspend/resume regression.
Alan Stern:  your ball now.
