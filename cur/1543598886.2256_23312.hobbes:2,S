The main reason to include it, is that that's what it was done in.
If you go back and read the archives, ESR goes over why all sorts of
other languages wouldn't work as easily.

That wasn't my point at all.  My point was that if you're somehow
transfering the 21mb source .tar.bz2'ed, you can also stand to transport
the 4mb of python 2.0.1 source, tar.gz'ed over as well.  In other words,
having to bring python over any of the methods that Jes mentioned isn't
any more painful than the kernel source.  It's roughly the size of a couple
of vmlinux'es.

Have you tried cml2 on your p166?  ESR went and did much speed tweaking of
the code about 6 months ago it seems like and managed to please some of the
people using a low-end pentium.  Building a kernel on a 386 isn't approcaching
tolerable right now anyhow.  Someone pointed out today or yesterday it takes
~10 days.

Speed is arguable.  On my p2/333s I didn't notice much of a difference.
On a lower end, yes, you might notice a bit of a slowdown.  But I'm also
one of those people who doesn't plan on running 2.4 on my p100 laptop,
let alone 2.6.

Python is no harder to maintain then C.
