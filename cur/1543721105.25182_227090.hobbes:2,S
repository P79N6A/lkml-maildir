Partly, yes it looks clearly what I
need (though I need it for 2.4).
But surely every developer or maintainer
of every driver or other part of the
kernel also has a clear need for every
Linux user to install this.  I am not
the only one who needs to get these
reports, right?  Shouldn't this be in
the main kernel tree by now, and enabled
by default?
