In arch/i386/kernel/irq.c (current git head) I found this comment:
/*
 * These should really be __section__(".bss.page_aligned") as well, but
 * gcc's 3.0 and earlier don't handle that correctly.
 */
static char softirq_stack[NR_CPUS * THREAD_SIZE]
                __attribute__((__aligned__(THREAD_SIZE)));
static char hardirq_stack[NR_CPUS * THREAD_SIZE]
                __attribute__((__aligned__(THREAD_SIZE)));
That should be fixed now that we require GCC 3.0, not?
Btw, there are other such comments, like in include/asm-i386/semaphore.h: 
sema_init (for GCC 2.7!). That one might not be the case to fix because of the 
increased stack usage
I've seen other similar tests around, so I thought that it'd be useful to 
centralize all tests for GCC versions to headers like include/compiler.h so 
they're promptly removed when deprecating old compilers.
What about this?
