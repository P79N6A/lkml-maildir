can a summary of this discussion get written and put into the
documentation directory so that every time a new person stubles on this
feature we don't have to go through this discussion again?

P.S. there are standards that are written documents and there are
standards that are 'how everyone does it' for the most part Linux follows
both types of standards, in this case the network team has decided to
ignore the 'how everyone else does it' standards becouse there is nothing
in a written standard that they are violating
