This is unlikely to be the latching bug - note the values are near to
65535 - that means the timer is reprogrammed to count from 0xffff down
instead from LATCH. That is because of the suspend I presume. What's
weird is that the VIA fix doesn't program it to the correct value, or
perhaps is that missing from the patch?
