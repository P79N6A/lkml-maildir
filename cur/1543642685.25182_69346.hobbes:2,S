Hi,
i'm looking for documentation on /proc/sys/vm/* but so far all the docs 
are outdated :(
Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt (the VM section) seems to refer to 
the older VM. The same thing with Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt.
Google only gives pointers to the same information.
Can anyone point me to the updated docs, please?
Thanks in advance,
Nuno Silva
