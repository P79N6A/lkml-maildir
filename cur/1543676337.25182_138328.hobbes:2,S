Alan,
Here's a patch to include the Broadcom 4400 series Ethernet adapters
v2.0.0 drivers in the kernel.  These adapters are popular on Dell's
newer laptops and are also used on some Asus motherboards.
The patch has worked successfully for me on 2.4.21-rc7-ac1 and some
previous versions.  It appears to patch successfully into 2.4.21-rc7 as
well, although I haven't tested that to date.  
FYI the other patch I've seen similar to this one appears to use an
older version of the drivers.  
I hope this helps!
