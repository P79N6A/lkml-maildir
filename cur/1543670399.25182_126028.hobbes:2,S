  No, that's not quite right.  Take this code for example:
   struct foo *bar;
   if (bar && bar->baz == 6) /* something */;
If bar were zero, then evaluating the right side of the && would cause
a fault.  (This is not a side effect.)
  So the AS IF part if your statement is right but you have to consider
more than just side effects.
