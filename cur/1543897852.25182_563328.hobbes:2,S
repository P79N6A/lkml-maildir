Arg, you're making me think. The POSIX group went through this,
let me see if I can reconstruct the logic.
The main issue is one if there being a possible case where you
have a capability ignorant program that you want to exec with
a different fP and fE. On first glance it seems that since the
program is capability ignorant it can't matter. But what if your
capability ignorant program exec's a capability aware program
to perform a helper function? You may well want the first program
to have a capability that it does not use in fP (but not fE)
to pass along to the helper program. True, you could probably
come up with a way to set the capabilities on the helper program
to account for this use, but there may be design and security
constraints that make doing so complicated.
