	Dear Eric;
	Oops'd twice on intel pentium 90 box. Same dosemu 1.0.0
binary and config files, 2.4.8-ac7 kernel. Behaviour was same as
my k6 box-- I did not decode oops, as that box didnt have a
serial console, and it didnt seem worth transcribing...
(was unable to oops it running 2.2.18pre21 on p90 box) Here
is the tail end of an strace. (the last bit that made it across
the wire during the telnet session-- I logged with fs mounted
sync, but the end of the log was garbage)
