First of all, using bitmap is not that good as exposed in this
mailing list (I think some good guys at IBM already implememted
bitmap for pids as part of Linux scalability enhancements & I
remember they discussed pros & cons too) & atomic operations
are not that cheap anyway. However it is good to have something
better than the previous one.
