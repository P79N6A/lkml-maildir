Hi,
I was just going through the include file in the /usr/include/asm/bitops.h
The function description describes it as non-atomic but it seems it is not. 
static __inline__ void __change_bit(int nr, volatile void * addr)
{
        __asm__ __volatile__(
                "btcl %1,%0"
                :"=m" (ADDR)
                :"Ir" (nr));
}
The kernel version I am using is 2.6.9-42. Is it right or am I missing something ?  
Thanks,
Pravin
