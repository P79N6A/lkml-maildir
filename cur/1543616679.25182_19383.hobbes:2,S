This may design-by-committee in action, or corporate rules
that are hard to defy. Don't worry about it. Intel will
never produce a new x86-compatible chip without cmov.
Nobody else will either.
Gee, when was the last time Intel removed something from the
instruction set? An old 80286 instruction comes to mind, but
that was a super-CISC mess that was really specific to the
implementation. Anything really useful that was ever removed?
