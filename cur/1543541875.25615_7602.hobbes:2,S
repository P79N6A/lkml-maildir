I have a patch which seems to select the 'right' process to
kill almost all of the time. In fact, I've had this patch for
well over a year now and I've submitted it to the list several
times.
Every time a flamewar ensued and the patch didn't get merged.
(and no, I'm not going to submit it again, I have better things
to do with my time than getting into the next flamewar)
regards,
Rik
