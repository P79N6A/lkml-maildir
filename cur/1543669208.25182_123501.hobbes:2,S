Yes, that could be done.  In fact, the current LOG BUFFER size
selection started out that way IIRC, but some people said things
like, "why have limits" and "make it more general," so I did,
I guess now we have an answer to "why have limits."  :(
If more people keep having problems with it, we should change it.
