The socket number is just a random allocation (but useful to keep two 
different sockets separated - think of it as just a unique ID). That value 
actually looks reasonable, it's in the kernel virtual address space.
However, the fact that it doesn't work clearly means that _something_ is 
wrong, and the memory size part is interesting:

It's almost certainly the Yenta PCI resource that got allocated in the 
wrong area, and instead of pointing to PCI memory-mapped space it just 
points to RAM. 
Can you show the results of "cat /proc/iomem" and "lspci -vvxxx", and also
try this with a 2.6.0-test3 kernel just to see if the resource handling is
fixed?
