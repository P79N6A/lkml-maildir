Hi,
On the advice of members of this list, I downloaded 2.4.18, patched to 
2.4.19-pre7 installed.
I enabled the via82cxxx option in ide config.
On bootup, just before the partitions are displayed, I get an oops at 
address 00000040, Null pointer dereferenced. Sorry, I was unable to get 
any of the other information it displayed :(
