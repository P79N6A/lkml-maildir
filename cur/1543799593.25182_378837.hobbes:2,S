This will break other hardware as the P30/P35 as well, since there
are some buggy DSDT's out there that return an ACPI_TYPE_BUFFER.
That's the whole reason why I was testing exactly for
ACPI_TYPE_INTEGER in my patch.
My first version was pretty simmilar to yours, until I was told on
acpi-devel that this breaks someone elses hardware (causing it to be
considered as P30/P35, while it isn't). I can dig up the mails if
you want.
Cheers,
Christian
