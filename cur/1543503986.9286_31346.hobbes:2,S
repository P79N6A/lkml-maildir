For the client I'd recommend the 2.2.6-ac3 or 2.2.10-ac12. The latter
still has a bit too aggressive cacheing (more aggressive than 2.2.6-ac3)
but I'd still prefer 2.2.10-ac12 for all the other updates and because it
is leading (the only thing newer is "proposed-2.2.11pre2" which I haven't
tried).

try ftp.<country>.kernel.org (e.g. ftp.us.kernel.org) and look in
/pub/linux/kernel/people/alan/2.2
> 	3.- How to do it (apply the patches)
Take a stock 2.2.6 or 2.2.10 kernel and unpack it. Create a symlink
before applying an "ac" (Alan Cox) patch:
	ln -s linux linux.ac
And apply the patch, e.g.:
	bunzip2 --stdout patch-2.2.10-ac12.bz2 | patch -sp0
The "ac" patches are cumulative, i.e. you don't have to apply the 1..11
patches in advance.
