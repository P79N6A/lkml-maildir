I've removed shutdown - things are the same.
Sometimes kevent performance drops to lower numbers and its graph of
times needed to handle events has high platoes (with and without
shutdown - it was always), like this:
Percentage of the requests served within a certain time (ms)
50%    128
66%    486
75%    505
80%    507
90%    732
95%   3087	// something is wrong at this point
98%   9058
99%   9072
100%  15562 (longest request)
it is possible that threre are some other bugs in the server though,
which prevent sockets from being quicly closed and thus its processing
time increases - I do not know for sure the root of that event.
I separated epoll and kevent servers, since originally kevent server 
included additional kevent features, but then new ones were added 
and I moved slowly to the similar to epoll case.
Current version of the server was a pre-test one for lighttpd patches,
so essentially it should be like epoll except minor details.
