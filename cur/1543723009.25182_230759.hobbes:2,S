It looks (to my untrained eyes) like a user-driven caching "algorithm", where 
I can keep these KDE tarballs around next to the kernel sources, and a few 
shiny new slackware ISOs, and all are of course  replaceable, but I mark them 
elastic or put them in /scratch/... to recover my space at the cost of an 
increased probability that I'll have to download some of them again. I like 
it.
