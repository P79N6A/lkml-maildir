Ugh.  Your message came just a little bit too late, I rebooted the
machine a couple of hours ago for applying an IPv6 patch, without
saving /proc/slabinfo.  The currently running kernel is 2.6.24.2 +
GFS1 exports + IPv6 fix, and I snapshotted /proc/slabinfo approx. 3
hours after reboot.  At least we will see whether this version also
produces the problem, it isn't too different after all (for some
"too").
Btw. there was no steady-state with the previous kernel, the increase
started right after reboot, which means that by tomorrow I'll be able
to tell whether it's increasing again or this kernel doesn't exhibit
such effect.

I wonder why I assumed everybody knows Munin's graphs by heart...
In short: "inode table size" is the first value from
/proc/sys/fs/inode-nr; "open inodes" is the same minus the second
value.  In other words:
awk '{print "used.value " $1-$2 "\nmax.value " $1}' < /proc/sys/fs/inode-nr
I'll come back shortly with the new findings.  If nothing turns up,
it's possible to boot up the previous kernel (or -- if needed --
current git) with this IPv6 fix added and check that again.
