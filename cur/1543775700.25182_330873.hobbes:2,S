I don't know if that was true at the time it was written, but today
the DRM implements vblank wait for 3 drivers (mga, r128, and radeon).
However, as far as I can tell, none of the X server's 2d  drivers
makes use of it. Perhaps some more work is needed to make the
interface convient for the X server?
If you have a card supported by one of these drivers, you can move on
to getting the X server to use that capability to support vblank
counters in the XSync extension.

Then you only need for toolkits (and/or individual apps) to get with
the program and start using using XSync.

linux/drivers/char/drm/  is where the kernel drivers for graphics cards live. 
Here is an overview of the different pieces of the current
drm/dri/xserver graphics puzzle:
