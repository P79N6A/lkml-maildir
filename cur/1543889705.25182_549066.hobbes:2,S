Zan,
this has been reported also in bugzilla, so it's now handled in 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8535
It's reported there that mainline is OK, and there are realy very few 
patches in the HID area which I can't imagine how they could be causing 
it, they are only a few simple quirks for a specific hardware.
Could you please try the following things in this order:
- disable CONFIG_HIDRAW and test whether it is still reproducible
- revert git-hid.patch and test whether it is still reproducible
- if so, I am afraid that it's some USB patch that is causing this, so 
  bisecting would be needed
I will meanwhile try to reproduce it myself here, but I have not been 
successful with it so far.
Thanks,
