The fact that backwards compatibility goes away, but forwards
compatibility never does?
Do we want to get into the morass of DOS, where we can't do the right
thing just because we have some old drivers we want to support? You can
have your network drivers do something like
	#if VERSION < 2.3.x
	#define net_device device
	#endif
and you're done with it.
