I just verified that adding VM_ACCOUNT to VM_MERGEABLE does allow the
merge to happen with the test program.  And the system didn't come
crashing down around me.  But, I wouldn't trust that simple test as the
last word.  A short run of a stress load I use held up/still running,
but I can't tell whether it's merging as expected there.   
I am running a slightly modified version of Maksim's test program under
the harness.  I modified it to mmap the entire region to reserve space,
then MAP_FIXED at each page address in the range returned by the first
mmap.  I saw that it was leaving holes between some of the pages w/o
this.  I'm going to automate the check for merging [read map and verify
a single segment at expected range] and leave that running with the
load.
