well, not exatly. My mouse starts hoping aroud, pressing buttons for
itself and ends up in the upper-left corner only moving a few positions
away from there.
I had no time to figure out what exactly the problem is, so I didn't
write any report since now.
Bye
Martin
P.S.: I do not have this problem with 2.4.0-test7, but I changed a few
options from 2.4.0-test7 to test8.
