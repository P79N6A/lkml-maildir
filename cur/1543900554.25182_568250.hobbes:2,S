  Great! It's quite a nice and lightweight tool which I think will become
one of my top tools for kernel debugging.
  Just one suggestion, maybe, would be to add to the readme file the
order in which the patches should apply along with a short description
of what functionality they provide (or maybe document the patches and add a
series file).
  Anyway, thanks for that great tool.
  Sébastien.
