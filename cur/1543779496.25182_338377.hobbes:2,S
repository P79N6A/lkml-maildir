Hi Andrew,
I noticed a strange return value in smsc_ircc_init in
drivers/net/irda/smsc_ircc2.c in rc4-mm1.
When reaching the line "if (ircc_fir > 0 && ircc_sir > 0)", ret is 0.
So I don't see the point of setting it to 0 in the "else" case.
From what I see in 2.6.12 it should probably be set to -ENODEV at
the begining of the "else" case. The attached patch does this.
Note that I didn't actually see any breakage caused by this.
