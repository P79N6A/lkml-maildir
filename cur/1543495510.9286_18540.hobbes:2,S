   Kernel guru's,
   Can someone give an official word regarding kernel process checkpointing
support?  "Eduardo Pinheiro" <edpin@cos.ufrj.br> has a checkpoint patch,
EPCKPT(*), available against 2.2.1 and 2.0.36 with which "Werner G. Krebs"
<werner.krebs@yale.edu> is using for checkpoint and process migration
support in the development version of GNU/QUEUE(**).  This feature is of
interest to my employer and we're wondering if it, or something like it,
will wind up supported in the kernel proper. 
Thanks!
J. Maynard Gelinas
