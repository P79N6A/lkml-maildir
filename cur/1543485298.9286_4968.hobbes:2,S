I was recently running fetchmail, mutt, and netscape at the same time, and
found that two of them were in a persistent D state....
I looked through /proc, tried ls /tmp, and the ls went into a D state.  It
seems at least two of them had open a *tremendous* file J<some
numbers+such> in /tmp.  After rebooting as gently as possible, I looked in
the file (don't remember contents), and deleted it.  Hasn't happened
since.
But I do wonder:  What exactly is "D"? Shouldn't there be _some_ way to
kill (SIGKILL) a process even if something is stuck?  Whether standard
behavior or not, I consider this a bug in Linux.  If it is standard
behavior, then it is a bug in the standard.
