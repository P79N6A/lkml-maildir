the lwn webpage have a article on modules of kernel 2.6 (
http://lwn.net/Articles/driver-porting/
 ,exactly ) and talk about on some differences with 2.6 kernel
the new version of kernel changed much things, the load module for example, and scheduling were the most commented.
the module-init-tools that you need, you can download from  
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rusty/modules/module-init-tools-0.9.15-pre2.tar.gz
 it is last version
