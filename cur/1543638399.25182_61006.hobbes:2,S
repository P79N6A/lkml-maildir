I was looking at the arp code and noticed the CONFIG_IP_ACCEPT_UNSOLICITED_ARP
option.
I'm a bit confused, however, since there is no way to enable this option without
specifying it on the command line.  Is this by intent?  It seems to have been
added back in 1998 in a patch by Thomas Koenig.
Just curious,
Chris
