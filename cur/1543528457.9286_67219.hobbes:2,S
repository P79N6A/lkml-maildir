I'm reminded of the literal pool in MACRO-10.  Whenever you go to store
some bits, look to see if they're already there, and if so then just point
to that copy instead.

It must be because at least 90% of kitting teams for Windows products
don't know where to stash the .DLLs, so you wind up with 69 separate
copies of the exact same .DLL scattered all over.  I can't think of any
other place where you'd find lots of duplicated files that hang around
long enough to be worth the bother.
Anyway the excitement isn't so much about the links as it is about what
they link to and how it got there.
