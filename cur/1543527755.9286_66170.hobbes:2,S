   Can you guarantee that?
Yes, I can.  Well, at least to approximately the same probabilty that
all of the oxygen in the room won't suddenly decide to go into one
corner, suffocating everybody else in the world.  (This isn't *likely*
to happen, but it is *possible*.  :-)
   As I see it, to make a guarantee like that, the UUID generating
   algorithm needs to include something specific to the machine it's
   running on, as well as something relating to the current time.
   The use of genuine random numbers can only come a poor second to
   this - remember that even 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 is a valid sequence of
   random numbers.
That's correct; UUID's have this property.  To quote from

The short version of the story is that if you have 128 bits, and you use
48 bits for an ethernet address, and 64 bits for a timestamp expressed
in 100's of nanoseconds since midnight GMT October 15, 1582, and use a a
couple of other bits for a generation counter (to deal with reboots and
other situations where the block might be adjusted backwards), you can
get pretty good.
Also, if you have a genuinely good random number generator, simply
generating 122-bit random number (The other 6 bits are set to a specific
pattern to distinguish them from non-type-4 UUID's) works pretty well.
Yes, there is a one in 2**122 chance you might pick the same UUID,
assuming that you have a good random number generator.  But those are
pretty small odds.  It's much more likely that a cosmic ray will alter
some location in memory, causing the system to crash or misbehave
randomly.  It's really small enough not to worry about.
