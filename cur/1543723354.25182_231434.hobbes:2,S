Thanks for the time in reading the patch.
Hmm. pop %ax after the jmp is a clear bug. Must have been a zero
on the stack when I tested it. <g>
For the clobbering of al just before kernel entry, that is badly arranged
code although it doesn't matter (mov $0, %al turns out to be no-op).
I'll fix the bugs if anybody still wants the patch.
I'll fix it anyway for myself <g>.
