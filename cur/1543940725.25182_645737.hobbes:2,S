the problem is that I think that most of those (mii-less cards) are customly
designed by OEM's that buy the silicon and glue on a different interface and we
usually do not carry those designs in our labs apart from a few exceptions. So, I
can at least touch the common hardware in testing, but not the exotic stuff.
