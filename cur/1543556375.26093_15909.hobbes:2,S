perhaps the netfilter stuff isn't 4-way SMP safe.  my quad ppro box
seizes with iptables too.  however, many people report it working with
2-way SMP boxen.
has anyone gotten netfilter/iptables to work on a SMP box with more
than 2 processors?
i recall old 2.0.x kernels deadlocking on a 4-way
until x=35 or so.  maybe this is somehow similar.
