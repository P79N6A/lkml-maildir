Hi Len,
These warnings pop up on allmodconfig as CONFIG_RELOCATABLE is set.
This option retains relocation information in vmlinux file and MODPOST
goes through these relocations and generates warnings.
So till date MODPOST never cribbed about vmlinux section mismatches as
it could never detect those. But with CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y, these mismatches
become visible to MODPOST.
Thanks
Vivek
