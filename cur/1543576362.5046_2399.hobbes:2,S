I just need a sanity check - do other pages/blocks sometimes show up in
recently created files in 2.4.0-test11?
I have a (so far) non-reproducible case where the wrong data showed up in
a new file.  The nice part is that it was when I was imploding a large
BitKeeper patch so I can run the test case over and over if that would 
help find it.
