I expect there were multiple writers when the task which hangs
first entered its ext2_prepare_write (it's a make -j20 build on
that ext2 filesystem); but by the time I come to look at the hang,
there's only that one writer active - everything else would be waiting
on that part of the build to complete (well, your question makes me
realize that I didn't look down the whole "ps" listing to see what
was waiting; but the hanging task is the only one I see running on
on any cpu, each time I break in).

I can understand that there may be a worst case like that: but I hope
it wouldn't take 20 hours to find a free block on a default 340MB ext2
filesystem!  And unless something else has gone wrong, this build would
not be filling the filesystem to that extent: it's probably around 80%
full at this stage, and shouldn't get fuller than 98% in the end.
Any suggestions for what I might check, next time it happens?
