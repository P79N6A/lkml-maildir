Is this an oops that looks somewhat like (giving one line of context here):
Freeing unused kernel memory: 88 kbytes.
kernel BUG in header file at line 155
kernel BUG at panic.c:141
invalid operand 0000
CPU: 0
and then traces back with:
>>EIP; c01148df <__out_of_line_bug+f/20>   <=====
Trace; c01a6ce7 <ide_build_sglist+127/160>
Trace; c01a738b <__ide_dma_read+2b/120>
...that's basically what I get with 2.4.21pre2, all drives on the legacy
IDE controller of an A7V333 and a PDC MBFastTrack133Lite RAID controller
configured in but no drives on it.
I'm doing some hdparms during bootup but I don't think it's getting to
them, I should add something to the top of the script to check, but I'd
rather not reboot the machine too often.
Apologies for the partial details of the oops, but my pen ran out. :-/
David.
