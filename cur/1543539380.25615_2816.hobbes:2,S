Ok I read, the docs, lp.c and parport.c and don't seem to figure it out
I get: 
parport0: PC-style at 0x378 [PCSPP,TRISTATE,EPP]
parport0: cpp_daisy: aa5500ff(98)
parport0: assign_addrs: aa5500ff(98)
parport0: Printer, EPSON Stylus COLOR 860
lp: driver loaded but no devices found
upon loading parport.o, parport_pc.o and lp.o in 2.4.0-test4..
if I do cat /dev/lp0 I get:
cat: /dev/lp0: Device not configured
I would really like to get my printer to work. (was fine with 2.2.14)
