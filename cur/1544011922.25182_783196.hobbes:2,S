Ah.. oops, missed the other messages.  Sorry.

Ah.. strange.  The command protocol is ATAPI_PROT_NODATA and the drive
should be setting DRQ to receive CDB but it's not doing that.
Strange.  It could be that the drive is a little bit tardy with DRQ -
ie. setting DRQ after clearing BUSY and ata_piix is now successfully
hitting the small window for some reason.
Does the attached patch make any difference?
Thanks.
