Hi,
I have updated the patch for kdbg to work for 2.3.23:
- I started with Pavel's patch (posted on 10/2/99 to the list)
- I added a few missing files and fixed a variety of issues
  caused by changes since 2.3.18
REMEMBER: you must stop "gpm" to get keyboard control back after the
"go" command.  This is not properly documented yet.
I tested it only on a NON-smp machine with a non-smp kernel. It works
well.
Thanks SGI!
