Yes, I spoke a little too soon.
I did more testing with a USB drive and it blew up after a few minutes. 
It was fine until I used USB.
I edited the original 2.6.16 quirks.c to not fixup the IDE bus and still
fixup the USB IRQs.
So far it's testing OK with dd copy loading to IDE, sata and USB 
simultaneously.

I will test the latest patch and give you results.
