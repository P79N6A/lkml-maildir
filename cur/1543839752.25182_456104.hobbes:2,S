Indeed, and rather than fixing execve() for one set of architectures
and by doing that breaking the other set, the point of this change is
to fix _all_ architectures in the most expedient way.
At a later date, those architectures who are using the global errno
can have that _separate_ bug fixed.
Let's fix one bug at a time.  Especially as this probably needs to go
in to -rc.
Arnd - thanks for taking this on.
