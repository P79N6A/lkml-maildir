This is a reiserfs security issue, but only of theoretical nature (Even if
triggered, it won't harm you). But the reason for this bug is in NFS (v2, v3,
hopefully not also v4) readdir braindamage.
I think, in Reiser(FS)4, a more sophisticated (NFS-)work-around (horizontal
displacement instead of vertical displacement) is planned.
I can tell you more if you want.
