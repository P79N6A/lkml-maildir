There are some places that do
err = -SOMEERROR;
if (some_error)
	goto out;
if (some_other_error)
	goto out;
if (another_error)
	goto out;
In that case, where there are several different conditions that need 
testing, but they all need to return the same error, setting the error 
just once seems the best approach.
but for the places that do
err = -SOMEERROR;
if (condition)
	goto out;
err = -OTHERERROR;
if (condition)
	goto out;
I would tend to agree with you that moving the setting of the error inside 
the if() would make sense.
Let's see what other people think :)
