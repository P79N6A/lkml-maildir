Interesting...
Could you please add this patch and see if it helps on your machine ?
[PATCH] VM : mm_struct's mmap_cache should be close to mmap_sem
Avoids cache line dirtying : The first cache line of mm_struct is/should_be mostly read.
In case find_vma() hits the cache, we dont need to access the begining of mm_struct.
Since we just dirtied mmap_sem, access to its cache line is free.
In case find_vma() misses the cache, we dont need to dirty the begining of mm_struct.
