Hi all,
     i fixed my problems with the 3C905C card as well as hard deadlocks
with  CDD2600 CDR drive and cdrecord.
For the 3Com 905C :
The card was detected, driver loaded and no errors detected. 2.2.14 could
transmit and recv perfectly while 2.2.17pre couldnt. I ran the card
overnight and in the morning i was getting checksum error messages. After
fiddling with the card i finally found that the fan (its one of those
exhaust things that fit in a standard slot and suck air out of the
system) was interfering with the card. moving the card to a higher slot or
disabling the fan completely fixed this problem (weird huh?). Evidently
2.2.14 sets up the card differently(?) that 2.2.17pre. anyway, now both
work perfectly.
For the hard deadlocking :
Using the onboard SCSI controller on my Asus P2BDS mobo, i was getting
hard deadlocks (very hard - the power button didnt even work..had to yank
the cable) when trying to record CDs using cdrecord. cdrecord would hang
before it reached the "you have 9 seconds to abort.." message. i finally
went into the adaptec BIOS and reduced the transfer rate to 20megs from
the default of 80megs. That cured it for some weird reason (too fast for
the drive(?)).
Anyway, im posting this in case anyones interested...
Thanks.
