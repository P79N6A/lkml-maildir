Patch for tty and ldisc is in your inbox...

This should be rephrased "Many network device drivers call
MOD_INC_USE_COUNT too late in dev->open()".
And it has been proposed (frequently, by me) that the
dev_hold()/dev_put()/unregister_netdevice() logic ensures that netdevice
drivers are _not_ race prone wrt module removal and so no development is
needed here.
Unless someone squeaks I suggest you take the red pen to this one.

It is my understanding that hen's teeth easily outnumber SMP PCMCIA
systems.  spinlocks in drivers/pcmcia/ and drivers/net/pcmcia/ are
almost nonexistent.
So I propose that this item be removed simply by stating "Linux 2.4 does
not support PCMCIA on multiprocessors".   Comments, David?
