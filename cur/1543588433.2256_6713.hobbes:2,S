Take your pick from one or more of the following:
    a) dodgy RAM - less likely if a different set of RAM has also had
       the problem;
    b) a faulty network card - a tulip (Netgear FA310TX) reliably caused me
       a hang ~6 months ago, so there is a precedent;
    c) overheating - see if, left to its own devices, the hangs become
       more frequent the longer the box is left on; also implement
       lm_sensors and keep an eye on the CPU temperature if possible;
    d) RH7 alert: did you use kgcc to build the kernel?
    e) Something totally else :8)
HTH,
~Tim
