Ehh...  First of all, you'll end up doing a metric buttload of getdents()
for no good reason every time you want to search for something.  And on
the kernel source that's pretty noticable.
Moreover, you generally do *not* want to deal with every file in the tree -
find . -name *.[chS] does it nicely, grep -r can't do that at all.
grep -r is a pointless GNUism.  It's not safer than find + xargs grep, it's
weaker than use of find and it's non-portable to boot...
