This boots the IA-64 successful and gets rid of that DMA corrupts
memory message. As a bonus, it fixes up the memoryless nodes (the bug
where Total pages == 0 and there is a BUG in page_alloc.c) by building
zonelists properly. The machine still fails to boot with the more familiar
net/core/skbuff.c:95 but that is a separate problem.
Well spotted Yasunori-san.
Andrew, this fixes a real problem and should be considered a fix to
memoryless-nodes-fixup-uses-of-node_online_map-in-generic-code.patch unless
Christoph Lameter objects.
