The configuration menu has changed recently so that support for normal
console operation is not included by default.  To activate the usual
console on VT and on VGA requires selecting options that are buried
in the 'Character device' 'Input device' and 'Graphics support' menu
sections.  Go all the way to the bottom of each section and you will
see the obvious items you need to select.  Rather a confusing change.
