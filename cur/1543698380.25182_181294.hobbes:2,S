I'm glad the ACPI PM time source is working for you. I hope it will
solve a great number of these sorts of issues on systems that support
it, but its not quite ready to be included. So the more testing the
better! Thanks!

Indeed. There are many systems that do not have working ACPI PM
timesource, so making sure the cpufreq code works for the TSC timesource
is important. I appreciate your offer.

Very interesting. Give me some time to generate a patch that will give
more debug info, and then we can sort out what is happening for sure. 
thanks
