A little more here, a little less there. No major changes except for dbench 
load which appears to have significantly shorter compile times. As kernel 
compiles are not by their nature "interactive", these results are expected. 
It is nice to see that it doesn't appear to starve any load unecessarily as 
well. 
Contest can show the kernel's ability to perform in the setting of different 
loads without being choked, but will not show if your audio application will 
get to play when it wants to, nor whether your windows will move around the 
screen smoothly.

P.S. Does anyone see the irony in the fact that my own benchmark won't show 
that my patch does anything?
