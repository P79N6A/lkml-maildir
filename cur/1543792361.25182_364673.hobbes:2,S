Hi !
I noticed that we set
#define CLOCK_REALTIME_RES TICK_NSEC  /* In nano seconds. */
Unconditionally in kernel/posix-timer.c
Doesn't that mean that we'll advertise to userland (via clock_getres) a
resolution that is basically HZ ? We do get at lenght to get more
precise (up to ns) resolution in practice on many architectures but we
don't expose that to userland at all. Is this normal ?
Ben.
