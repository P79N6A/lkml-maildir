Not true.  root=/dev/whatever is /not/ a command-line option on
i386.  It gets stored in the b?zImage header.
See "man rdev".
I suspect that there was once a time when the kernel had no concept
of a command-line at all.  And anywy, it's very useful be be able to
dd a kernel onto a floppy without having to put something like LILO
there too.
