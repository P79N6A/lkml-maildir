Some corrections to the preamble.

Should say:
The large amount of text in the explanation below is due to
the nature of the problem and the discussion engendered on
lkml by my first submission.

Actually, the patch doesn't do a pci config read of EVERY device
discovered on every bus. Only on buses above a number defined
by PCI_MMCFG_MAX_CHECK_BUS and whose parent bus's pci_bus.ops
field points to pci_root_ops, which are mmconfig access routines
in systems in which mmconfig is the default mechanism.
In such cases where the parent bus pci_bus.ops field points
to pci_legacy_ops, the current bus does not need to be probed,
since its own pci_bus.ops field will inherit the pointer to
pci_legacy_ops from its parent.
