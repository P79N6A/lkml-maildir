This looks shady to me.  Can this be solved in userspace by just
making sure that modprobe loads ib_mad before this module?
As it stands you're leaking a mad agent at the very least, not to
mention the hard-coded 2 in there.

What happens if a device is hot plugged or unplugged after you call
ipath_layer_get_num_of_dev() but before you call ipath_verbs_register()?
For that matter, what happens if a device is hot plugged after this
module loads?
