You could say new code in general causes security holes... don't fix it
and you won't break it.   There is the security principle of least privilege
though...
RH7 (and earlier I think) run bind drops root and runs as user named after
opening
a listening socket, so I don't think a bind
compromise could retrieve the /etc/shadow file and modify system binaries...
and RH7.1(beta) will use capabilities to furthur restrict privileges given to
bind(v9).
(not root ever)
