Subject: IRQ_NONE definition in NCR5380 driver...

Currently the NCR5380.h defines IRQ_NONE to be 255, is there any special
reason for this? why not use UINT32_MAX-1?..
The VAX actually has got more than 255 interrupt handlers which we've
mapped to IRQs, and it happens the external SCSI interface is at 255, so
this makes it a bit sick...
I've redefined it in our tree to 65535 but I see no reason not to go to
the above... any objections?
Dave.
