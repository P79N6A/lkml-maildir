This update was obviously submitted without even testing the compilation 
of the driver (not to mention testing whether it actually works).
Even worse:
We had _exactly the same problem_ with the 7.00.15 driver in 
2.4.27-pre3, but 7.10.18 now simply reverts my (trivial) fix for this 
compile error.
Marcelo, can you please refuse patches from people who don't bother to 
do even the simplest compile testing when blindly submitting the latest 
version of a driver?
TIA
Adrian
