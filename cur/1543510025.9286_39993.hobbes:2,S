As far as I know it hasn't. I talked to DPT a fair bit early on about this
and about the i2o drivers (the DPT is an I2O compliant controller so should
'just work' with the 2.3.x i2o drivers)

As I understand it - It isnt DPT's to drop. It is the I2O sigs. Someone 
would need to replace the I2O sig provided headers/defines with the ones 
in the existing Linux i2o headers (which were carefully done from the docs 
to avoid precisely this trap).
AFAIK the i2o sig hasnt changed the license on its headers.

You get source to the DPT driver, you can recompile it for any 2.2.x
driver probably without the slightest glitch. For 2.3.x the generic I2O
support ought to be covering this card.
