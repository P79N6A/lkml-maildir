Looks like you are probably right ...

For now we can just do this,

Or perhaps leave the code as-is but make the rule preemption needs to be
disabled before calling (either implicitly or explicitly).  I.e., via a
call to preempt_disable or because interrupts are disabled, a lock is
held, etc ...

One thing Linus, DaveM, and I discussed a while back was actually
getting rid of the irq and bh counts completely and folding them into
preempt_count.  I am interested in this...
