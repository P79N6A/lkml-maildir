This usually means that there is a static __exit function (or __devexit etc.)
somewhere in the object being linked.  The error message is pretty unhelpful
in figuring out *where* in the module.  Look at the 'mm' patches that touch
arch/ia64/kernel to see if one of them tinkers with __exit* attributes.
