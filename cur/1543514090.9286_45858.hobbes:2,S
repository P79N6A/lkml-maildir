   Easy solution to that;  don't use those strings.
   As other people have said, all you care about are the human-readable
   strings for the devices you want, and you can, with the use of some
   clever trickery (ioctls?  writing to /proc/pci?) build a little
   user-space daemon that picks out the vendor/device identifiers from
   /proc/pci and, using the userland database that lspci (or whatever
   it's called) uses to map vendor/device to names, write the strings
   you actually need into /proc/pci.
   And (similarly to devfs), if you don't want to use it, you don't have
   to use it.   There is a large body of Linux users who don't care to
   have the kernel tell them anything, and thus /proc/pci will remain
   uncluttered by nasty verbosity in that case.

   The spiffy thing about ``cat /proc/pci'' is that I don't need any
   userland tools outside of cat and ksh.  (And
       while read line;do echo "$line"; done
   doesn't even need cat.)

   Yes.
