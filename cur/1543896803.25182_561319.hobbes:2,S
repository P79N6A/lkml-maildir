2.6.21 had 476 lock_kernel() calls. 2.6.22-git has 473 lock_kernel() 
calls currently. With that kind of flux we'll see the BKL gone in about 
40 years =B-)
'struct semaphore' use on the other hand has gone down by 10% in this 
release, which is a good rate. I guess the lack of lockdep coverage for 
semaphores might be one of the driving forces? ;-)
