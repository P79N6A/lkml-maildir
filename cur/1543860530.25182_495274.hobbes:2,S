This is a nice approach but what if someone does kfree_nullify(x+20).
I decided to keep it simple. If someone is calling kfree_nullify() with anything other than a
simple variable, then they should call kfree().  But definitely an approach that takes care of all
situations is the best but I cannot think of a macro that can handle all situations. The simple
macro that I sent earlier will catch all the other usage at compile time. Please let me know if I
have missed something.
