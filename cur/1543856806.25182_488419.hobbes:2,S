Subject: [kernel-2.6.18.5]  Make install keeps asking dm_mirror module

While trying a few compile options I selected once Multidevice-support
RAID.
Then I disabled this option in doing menuconfig and saving the config.
#
# Multi-device support (RAID and LVM)
#
# CONFIG_MD is not set
Since then, despite I deleted /lib/modules/2.6.18.5 and completely
untared kernel source into a new directory, "make install" keeps on
asking for mirror module.
I eventually made an oldconfig from previously installed linux-2.6.18.3
.config with the same result.
Here is what I get after make, make modules_install :
[root@bernard linux]# make install
sh /usr/src/linux-2.6.18.5/arch/i386/boot/install.sh 2.6.18.5
arch/i386/boot/bzImage System.map "/boot"
FATAL: Module dm_mirror not found.

Looking for deps of module initramfs
Looking for deps of module atkbd
Looking for deps of module ide-mod
Looking for deps of module ide-probe-mod
Looking for deps of module ide-core
Looking for deps of module ide-disk
Looking for deps of module ext3
         jbd
Looking for deps of module jbd
Looking for deps of module lzf
Using modules:  ./kernel/fs/jbd/jbd.ko ./kernel/fs/ext3/ext3.ko
Using /root/tmp as temporary directory.
...
Any suggestion for removing this dependency ?
