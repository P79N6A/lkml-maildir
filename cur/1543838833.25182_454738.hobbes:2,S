Why can't O_EXCL mean that the kernel prevents anyone else from issuing
ioctl's to the device?  One would think that is the meaning of exlusive.
That way when the burning program opens the device with O_EXCL, no one
else can screw it up while it is open.  If it happens to be polled by
hal when the burning program tries to open it, it can just wait and
retry again until it gets it open.
