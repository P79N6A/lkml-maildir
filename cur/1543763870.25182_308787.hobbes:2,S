Hi there,
I'm a newbie in Linux kernel development and hopefully my question has
some quick solution..
I'm trying to access performance counters on a dual Xeon processor
machine (both processors are 32-bit and HT enabled). Since each
processor (logical/physical) has their own performance counter, I'd like
to get the numbers for a processor. Is there a way I can do some
pre-work before executing rdpmc instruction to set up the context to
access counter information of a certain processor? Or, what is the best
way to do get the counter information for a certain processor in a
multi-processor environment.
If anybody has some information, I'd really grateful..
Thanks in advance,
Regards,
Sameer
