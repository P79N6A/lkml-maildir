And another obsolete tape drive goes on my vintage shelf.

  Summary: osst, the Linux OnStream Tape driver now avalable on sf.net
  Following the unfortunate bankruptcy of OnStream, I have now completed
  the migration of the osst CVS repository, web site and mailing list to
  SourceForge.
  Willem Riede,
  osst maintainer.
How does this relate to your removal of onstream from 2.6?  I'm guessing
that you are maintaining onstream in 2.4, but not in 2.6 or beyond.  But
that's just a guess.
With onstream tape cartridges selling for (another guess - can't
actually _find_ any for sale anymore) at $4/Gbyte, and IDE drives at
under $1/Gbyte, using removable drives for backup makes more sense than
using onstream, anyway I can see to cut it.  And the chances of the IDE
interface going obsolete anytime soon seem refreshingly small.
