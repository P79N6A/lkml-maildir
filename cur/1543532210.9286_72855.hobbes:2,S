Andre... what we're trying to figure out if there is a way to this
*TRANSIENTLY*, so that a reset will set it back to the old value.
However, if plugging in manual values in the BIOS works then that's
probably the recommended way, unless there really is an easy way to work
around.
Remember... most hardware/firmware is broken.  Part of what makes a good
OS is to work with broken hardware without sacrificing working with
properly working hardware.  God knows I've messed lots with BIOS bugs.
