This can be done in standard C.  If you want an inline, how about 
(from .../kernel/posix-timers.c):
static inline u64  mpy_l_X_l_ll(unsigned long mpy1,unsigned long mpy2)
{
	return (u64)mpy1 * mpy2;
}

This appears to be the same as (from .../include/asm-i386/div64.h):
#define div_long_long_rem(a,b,c) div_ll_X_l_rem(a,b,c)
extern inline long
div_ll_X_l_rem(long long divs, long div, long *rem)
{
	long dum2;
       __asm__("divl %2":"=a"(dum2), "=d"(*rem)
       :	"rm"(div), "A"(divs));
	return dum2;
}
