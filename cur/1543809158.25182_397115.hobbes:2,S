  Ok, I'll have a look at the problem. Probably something in
log_do_checkpoint() is not waiting for all the data or something like
that. I'll try to reproduce with ext3 - it uses journal_flush() in
ext3_bmap() so if journal_flush() is not flushing all the data we should
be able to see that... Thanks for spotting the problem.
