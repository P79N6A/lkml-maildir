I agree in general, but there are two uses for this ugly construct.  One 
is for drivers and isolated sections of code which actually interact 
with the real world.  They need real time delays.  The only two examples 
so far are SMP coprocessor bootstrapping and blinking LEDs with a 
recognizable frequency.  I don't expect many more to show up.
The other use for this construct is compiling a hardware privileged 
virtual domain that actually drives real hardware - you can just define 
this globally to override any delay masking.
