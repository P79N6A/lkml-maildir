Cool :)  Creative and interesting solution.
IMHO that's a slippery slope...  If you do this as a solution for
multifunction devices, you also have to consider even more stupid
hardware which exports one PCI function, but multiple BARs for different
purposes...
Another problem, which I have yet to think much about, is doing a
reverse mapping after what you just describe:  how does one figure out
that a bridge+devices is really a single hardware device?  Answering
that question is interesting for NICs as well, because 4-port NICs often
appear as four devices behind a bridge.  Some operations, such as
sharing an EEPROM across four ports, or setting a special flag if you
are quad-port hardware, require that knowledge.  [ugly hacks exist now
to get around our lack of such knowledge]
