line 1574 of md.c is an MD_BUG which gets called if "analyse_sbs"
returns non-zero.
analyse_sbs returns non-zero only if the label "abort:" is jumped.
Every "goto abort" is preceeded by an "MD_BUG" or a printk except one
after check_disk_sb and one after alloc_array_sb.
These both print messages in cases were they fail, except for
alloc_array_sb which won't print a message if __get_free_pages
fails.
So, if the message about "1574 of md.c" is the first message you get,
then __get_free_page must be failing.  It it isn't, please tell us the
first error message that you get.
