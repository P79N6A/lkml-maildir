I'm running it (2.4.10-pre4-low-latency) on my alpha now, so if you want to add
the appropriate magic to arch/alpha/config.in, please do.
Unfortunately, the use-once stuff broke again in the vm of this kernel, and now
I can't perceive any advantage due to low-latency because of all the swapping. :(
