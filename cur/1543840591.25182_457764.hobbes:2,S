That should be staying in order unless the device memory is mislabelled
and prefetchable etc.

What happens if you swap the memcpy_toio with while() writeb() ?

They do a lot of stuff but it should not affect the PCI side and I'd
expect it to do other things than byte lane re-ordering.

Is the buffer 32bit aligned ?
