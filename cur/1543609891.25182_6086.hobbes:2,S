Me too.
I looked around, and 1KB block size is hard-coded in too many places.
For example, function 'generic_make_request()' in
'drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c' assumes 512 sector and 1024 block size:
    if (blk_size[major])
	minorsize = blk_size[major][MINOR(bh->b_rdev)];
    if (minorsize) {
	unsigned long maxsector = (minorsize << 1) + 1;		<--
	unsigned long sector = bh->b_rsector;
	unsigned int count = bh->b_size >> 9;
So, using 'u64 *blk_size[][]' seems to be the most straightforward
solution, leaving BLOCK_SIZE alone.
I thought 'drivers/block/nbd.c' was already using 64-bit count,
according to its comment at the top.  But, curiously, it reverts back to
'int' count of BLOCK_SIZE.  I tried searching list archives for 64-bit
patch, but no luck.
Any URL would be helpful.
Is changing 'int' to 'u64' (and all the dependent code) enough to get
64-bit block devices?  I'm willing to do the work.  I don't care about
filesystem; that's the job for maintainer of particular filesystem.  I
understand XFS is 64-bit, so I can use that.
