   really?  if i remove my ethernet interface i expect all the
   connections to die.
Nope, this actually works.
Many a moon ago, we did this wrong and yes the TCP connections
died.
But these days, definitely if you bring the interface back up
with the same IP addresses, it just works and the connections
recover.
