I guess the backtrace would be pretty important here.
Guys, please don't add BUG_ONs unless there is simply no sane way to recover.
Because when someone goofs up, the BUG_ON will kill the whole machine and
everyone else who has code being tested in -mm loses a tester.
Plus a BUG_ON *greatly* decreases our chances of getting a trace from the
tester: dead box, nothing in the logs.
