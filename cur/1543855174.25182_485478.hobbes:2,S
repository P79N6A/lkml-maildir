Page tables are the major type of allocation that comes to mind. From what 
I've seen, they are the most common long-lived unmovable and unreclaimable 
allocation.

Indeed, although some sort of placement is still needed to keep these 
movable allocations together.

That is not the intention. It just happens that allocations that are 
directly accessible by userspace are also the ones that are currently 
movable.
