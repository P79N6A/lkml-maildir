A good point!  If we keep jiffies and sub jiffies in the timer
structure, then the sub jiffies should be in hardware defined units
(i.e. what we need to directly talk to the hardware).  This argues for
the jiffie to be longer than the longest expected inter event interval,
i.e. for it to be larger than 10 ms.  Seconds and sub seconds?  At least
this eliminates the mpy from the high order part.  
I think we need to balance the units used in the time list with the
needs of the list management code.  It may not be a good idea to tie it
too tightly to the jiffie.  Thinking aloud here...
Another though, if we keep a small conversion table to convert from
jiffies to machine units for say the first 10 jiffies, then force an
"non event" timer interrupt if needed.  This would, I guess, get us back
to a tick system, but with tick every 10 jiffies...  Still thinking...
