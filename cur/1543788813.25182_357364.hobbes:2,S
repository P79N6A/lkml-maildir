Hi Dmitry,
Could you please outline the class device requirements for the input
subsystem?  Specifically I'm interested in the class -> subclass layering.
I'm trying to understand what is needed and how the input subsystem should
be structured.
I can think of other subystems that might benefit from class layering.  One
example might be wireless cards: net and net/wireless.  In this case devices
that belong to class "wireless" would inherit all of the capabilities of the
"net" class and also implement the "wireless"-specific feature set.
Thanks,
Adam
