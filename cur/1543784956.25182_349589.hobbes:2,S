If we acknowledge the fact that syncing the release dates of two  
projects
is basically futile, especially given that under your system the kernel
headers would not change much/at-all to make the user-headers project
easier, then any feature X that appears in a new release of the kernel
will not be accessible from userspace tools without ignoring the  
point of
the user-headers project all together and having separate headers.   
Given
this, as well as the maintenance burden for those who would need to
maintain the user-headers (which would be nearly nil if the current
kernel headers could be cleaned up to the point which they could be used
instead), this project is lots of messy work either way, but in the long
run, if included into the upstream kernel, it will result in much less
duplication of effort and much cleaner code.
Cheers,
