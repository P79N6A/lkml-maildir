It's this ability to make major architectural changes that differentiates
free software from commercial software, as the accounting people and the
marketing people don't have any leverage as to what goes into the OS.  It
allows us to stay "pure" in the technical sense and not full of legacy
wrappers and useless or over-hyped features.  And the one place we REALLY
do not want legacy interfaces hanging around is the kernel.
What really does hurt Linux, however, is the lack of clear documentation
of what exactly changes between versions in some form other than source
code.  This is a hard problem, however, as it would prove to be quite a
task keeping documentation up to date.
