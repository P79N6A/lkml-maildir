Subject: strange delays on console logouts (tty != 1)

Since some days ago I'm using the console more than X and I have a
strange problem.
On tty's != 1 it takes a long time (~20-30 secs) from logout to next
login but on tty1 it takes a normal time.
If I launch getty on tty9 and logout (in tty9) getty ends inmediately
and I can start it again and get another login.
I'm not sure if it actually has something to do with the kernel (maybe
with /sbin/init). dmesg doesn't say anything about that.
Thanks,
