Right.  After locking vfsmount_lock, mount_dironfile() should recheck
if there was a race and bail out.

I don't think the filesystem ought to try _creating_ a vfsmount.  I
imagine, that the fs has already a kernel-internal mounted for this
kind of stuff, and it just supplies a dentry from that.  The vfsmount
isn't actually important, but it should be readily available, and it's
easier to clone from a vfsmount/dentry pair.

Yes.  On namespace cloning the MNT_DIRONFILE will be re-added later.
Otherwise we shouln't even get here with MNT_DIRONFILE.

It _should_ work.  The mount in the new namespace will be created
(with namespace_sem held, so we can't yet free this mount), and then
dropped, because there are no refs to it.

As I said, the superblock should be persistent, so we'll get a stable
st_dev for multiple mounts.
