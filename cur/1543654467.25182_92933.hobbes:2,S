Hi,
I have nothing in my logs but have had three more chrashes since
my first report. Two of them I couldn't inspect since I was at
work (the machine is at home) and had my girlfriend boot the box,
but the last one was identical to the reported one.
I am getting a new processor now and hope that'll do it.
Thanks for your comments,
  Rasmus
