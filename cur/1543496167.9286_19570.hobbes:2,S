  I think it is good to distinguish them. The format is same but needn't to be the same and a content is different.
I feel magic like identifier of file type including the content semantics not just like format identifier.

  Padding for disk block boundary is good idea. IMO reserving the place in entries
is not necessary. Current design is "Have something else to control? Make another file."..
