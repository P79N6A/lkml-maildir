Hi Grant,
I think it is well documented that config cycles are non-posted in PCI,
PCIX, and PCI Express specs as you pointed out. The only ambiguity is
whether the mmconfig memory cycle from the CPU to the chipset is posted
or not. The Implementation Note in the MMCONFIG ECN from pcisig (link
below) allows the mmconfig write cycle to be posted, meaning mmconfig
write cycle can complete before the real config write cycle completes.
That's why we needed confirmations from chipset engineers.
Michael
