Using reply all, it shows up in the inbox first?
And, running 2.6.15-rc6 for the third time, its all working!
And I asked for some nilmerg spray earlier, this thing has a few of 
those. :(

THRM at default, and temp2, both result in only one reading, of about 
156F in gkrellm, I guess I better truck this thing out to an air hose 
& give it a litteral blow job.

Several entries, in the THRM subdir, and tempertaure is 69C.  Youch!
Later, after I blow this thing out.
