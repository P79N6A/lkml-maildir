The only difference is that taking it from kernel space would require to
have different a whole block of 4k*512 naturally aligned virtual space
with PAE or 4k * 1024 w/o PAE. So taking it from userspace saves some
mbyte of kernel virtual address space. Also the higher level pagetables
there won't generate more overhead because they're necessary for the
previous user stack anyways.

Then you misunderstood what's the zone-normal, the zone normal is 800M
in size not 4GB. The 1GB of KVA is what constraint the size of the zone
normal to 800M. We're talking about the same thing, just looking at it
from different point of views.

We do pretty well with pte-highmem, there is some other bit that will be
better to optimize, but nothing major.
