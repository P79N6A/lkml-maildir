Linus, Eric, thanks for the history lesson.  I think it's safe to say 
that anything that breaks because of this sort of change was already 
broken anyway.
If we're going to scale to an obscene number of CPUs (which I believe 
was the original motivation on this thread) then putting the dead 
children on their own list will probably scale better.
