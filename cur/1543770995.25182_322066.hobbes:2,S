Hmm. There's also a new attribute there, that shall wait for 2.6.12.
There was a general cleanup coverting *all* direct uses of char* to
first cast to u8 *, not only in pci_write_config where it triggers
an actual bug. Do you want all that cleanup in?
I can do it, just let me know.

I did verify it before sending :), my patch below does fix the problem.

No, unsigned int is 32 bit wide on all platforms with gcc,
char is signed and 8 bit wide on all platforms with gcc.
So if you have a char value with a top bit set:
char c = 0xe0;
then the following holds:
((unsigned int)c) == 0xffffffe0

I use Intel x86_64.

Okay, since its small I repost here. Let me know whether you want that or
the bigger cleanup backported 2.6.12.

cast from (signed) char to unsigned int in pci_write_config causes the result
to be sign extended, clobbering high bits in the result. Thus:
# setpci -s 07:00.0 14.L=E4
# setpci -s 07:00.0 14.L
ffffffe4
