Subject: patch: remove some lock contention in sys_readv, sys_writev
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here's a patch against 2.3.19 that removes lock_kernel()/unlock_kernel() 
in sys_readv/sys_writev for the case where socket I/O is occurring and where 
the IOV array fits on the stack.   I'm pretty sure this is OK to do
because sock_read and sock_write (which are called without kernel_flag) are so
similar to sock_readv_writev.
Background: I'm working with some web proxy cache software that ends up
doing a lot of writev's to sockets.  We're using the lockstat/lockmeter
patch that was recently posted to linux-kernel to measure lock contention.
On a dual processor machine running 2 independent proxy processes, kernel_flag 
contention was taking up about 30% of time before this patch.  After the 
patch it's closer to 10-15%.   kernel_flag contention, which is the bulk of
all contention we see, still occurs in sock_alloc, do_close, sock_poll, and 
a few other places.
One bit of paranoia.. in the case where kmalloc needs to be called, I 
go back and call lock_kernel, since I'm not positive that kmalloc can 
be called without the kernel being locked.   This might be too
conservative.
