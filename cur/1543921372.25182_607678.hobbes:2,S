Xorg with XFCE4 - it even happens opening up a mousepad and typing
something in it. I do not have particular services running, I have
apache, mysql and samba. I have installed it on July, so it's a pretty
new system - the problem didn't happen before the most recent kernels.

How can I accomplish this? Are you referring to the i8042?

It is a laptop (Maxdata Pro 7000 DX) with an Intel Centrino 1.6 GhZ
(pentium-m), so it is not.

I am pretty sure they are. I think that ACPI pauses interrupts for a
while (100ms?) and so some keyboard interrupts are lost.

I will come up with a test for lm_sensors and the USB keyboard as soon
as possible.
Thank you very much
