Deadlocks? More information please. It's OK to deallocate an skbuff
right after it's been allocated, even in an interrupt handler. And the
network stack will probably never see the packet being sent.

That makes sense. It's OK to just store a pointer to the skbuff and
simply
free it when I'm done?
From reading from 'Linux device drivers', it's not clear when bottom
halves are run. Either it is right after the irq exits, or on the
next timer tick. This book only really covers 2.0.x. Has this changed?

Good idea.
