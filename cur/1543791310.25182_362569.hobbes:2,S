On top of Mel's patch? I think this is essiential for any guarantees
that you might be interested... but it would just mean that now you
have a redundant extra zoning layer.
I think ZONE_REMOVABLE is something that really needs to be looked at
again if you need a hotunplug solution in the kernel.

I can imagine one could have a sysctl to allow/disallow non-easy-reclaim
allocations from ZONE_REMOVABLE.
As Ingo says, neither way is going to give a 100% solution - I wouldn't
like to see so much complexity added to bring us from a ZONE_REMOVABLE 80%
solution to a 90% solution. I believe this is where Linus' "perfect is
the enemy of good" quote applies.

Perhaps, but Mel's patch only guarantees you to change once, same as
ZONE_REMOVABLE. Once you eat up those easy-to-reclaim areas, you can't
get them back.

Hugepage users? They can be satisfied with ZONE_REMOVABLE too. If you're
talking about other higher-order users, I still think we can't guarantee
past about order 1 or 2 with Mel's patch and they simply need to have
some other ways to do things.
But I think using zones would have advantages in that they would help
give zones and zone balancing more scrutiny and test coverage in the
kernel, which is sorely needed since everyone threw out their highmem
systems :P
