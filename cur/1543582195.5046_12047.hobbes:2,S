Actually I do.  Perhaps I should define enterprise as "big iron".  In
that way, enterprise kernels would be far more innovative than a
secure kernel (which cares less about performance gains and large
features and more about just being "secure").  Unless you meant
something else and I'm misinterpreting what you've stated. :)

I always considered SGI's kernels, from the low-end system up to
the large server configurations, to scale well.  Certainly it didn't
work on PDAs. :)  If you consider it a flaw for vendors to be able
to create their own Linux kernels based on optimizations
for their hardware and their customers, then that's a horrible
perspective on overall open source progression.  In fact, I think
if some of these vendors created their own kernel trees, it would
inevitably lead to inclusion of the best features into the primary
kernel tree.  Where's the harm in that?

Agreed.  It's great to have a "primary" kernel.  I'd like to see
more splintered kernels (not smaller project efforts), that's all.
And I don't think that convergence happens quickly or efficiently
enough, despite all the great work Linus and Alan do.
