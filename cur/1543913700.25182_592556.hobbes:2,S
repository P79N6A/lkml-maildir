Are you familiar with the "flat device tree" used for PowerPC systems?  The 
"piece of code somewhere" is the device tree subsystem that parses the device 
tree, which is compiled from the .dts files in arch/powerpc/boot/dts.
The FDT is how PowerPC systems specify hardware configuration.  In the case of 
85xx, the FDT contains entries for each DMA device (typically 2), and the 
entries contain sub-entries for each DMA channel as well as the address of the 
register sets for each channel.
