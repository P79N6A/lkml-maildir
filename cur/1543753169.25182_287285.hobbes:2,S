yes. The PID arguments in these APIs are all treated as 'TIDs'. One day
the APIs themselves might switch over to what POSIX specifies, and there
will be new, thread-specific APIs - but at the moment they are all
thread-granular.
(If then this switchover will happen in a controlled manner via glibc,
not via the kernel. I.e. kernel will introduce new syscalls to do the
per-process priority changing, then newest glibc will utilize it - i.e.
already existing apps will stay compatible.)
