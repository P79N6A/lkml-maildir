Regardless of whether it's a good thing to depend on security-wise, it
is a problem to have something that appears to be a security feature
which doesn't actually work.
Reading the documentation, I would expect that if I create an ext3
filesystem, reserve 20% of it for root, and then run a cron job as root
that uses 16% of that filesystem periodically, that cron job will not
actually fail whenever some luser decides they want it to.
I don't recall seeing it plastered in huge letters, "This space reserve
is just a convenience feature, and can easily be circumvented by the
user.  You must never rely on it for anything."
Having unsupported security features is typically a bad idea.
