AFAIK the new value of ->cur should be visible to other CPUs when smp_mb() 
returns. Here's a definition of smp_mb() from Paul's article:
smp_mb(): "memory barrier" that orders both loads and stores. This means loads 
and stores preceding the memory barrier are committed to memory before any 
loads and stores following the memory barrier.

Again, going by the above article, I would expect CPU1 to see the new value of 
var.
