Btw., for historic kicks i just went back to v2.6.15-2019-gf17578d - the 
last pre-mutexes semaphore based kernel, using the same .config.
I tracked down two bugs in it to make it boot on a Nehalem, so we can now 
compare the above numbers against historic semaphore performance:
                      [v2.6.14]     [v2.6.29]
                      Semaphores  | Mutexes
            ----------------------------------------------
                                  | no-spin           spin
                                  |
  [tmpfs]   ops/sec:       50713  |  291038         392865       (+34.9%)
  [ext3]    ops/sec:       45214  |  283291         435674       (+53.7%)
A 10x macro-performance improvement on ext3, compared to 2.6.14 :-)
While lots of other details got changed meanwhile, i'm sure most of the 
performance win on this particular VFS workload comes from mutexes.
So i think the long mutex migration pain was definitely worth it.
