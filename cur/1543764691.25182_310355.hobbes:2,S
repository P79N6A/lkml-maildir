The sha1 (ascii) digests for 16817 files take:
	689497 bytes before compression
	397475 bytes after minigzip
The pathnames, relative to top of tree, for these 16817
files take:
	503983 bytes before compression
	 85786 bytes after minigzip compression
I doubt any fancifying up of the pathname storage will gain much.
However going from binary to ascii sha1 digest might help (compresses
better, I suspect - I'll have to write a few lines of code to see).
