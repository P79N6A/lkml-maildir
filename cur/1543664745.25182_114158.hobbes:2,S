Hi Gary.
I have made a brief look at the shell script.
It assume .o for modules, which is not true for 2.5.
When building a module it simply executes $MAKE - which is plain wrong.
As have been discussed in several threads you cannot reliably track
changes in CFLAGS etc. without utilising the kbuild infrastructure.
DKMS is also highly connected to the usage of /lib/modules/...
and naming of config files. It looks to me as it is very distribution
specic.
