I built with this patch and had some problems with the system
locking up.
First attempt:
 - booted to single user without problem
 - telinit 5 was OK as well
 - logged in. After first window popped up, I did
  su -
to get root access and the system locked up. No display updates
nor any mouse movement. Entering Alt-SysRq-L displayed
  SysRq : Show Regs On All CPUs
and no other messages appeared on the serial console. Attempts
to use other Alt-SysRq keys were ignored, hard reset to reboot.
Second attempt:
 - booted to single user without problem
 - telinit 5 failed after kudzu timed out (had "detected" a
change due to the serial console)
No messages on serial console after the kudzu timeout. This time
Alt-SysRq-L did work. Also did Alt-SysRq-T and -D and will send
the all the serial console messages separately.
Did notice an odd message during the dump of tasks...
Losing too many ticks!
TSC cannot be used as a timesource.
Possible reasons for this are:
  You're running with Speedstep.   [almost surely not]
  You don't have DMA enabled for your hard disk (see hdparm), [udma4 should
be set at this point]
  Incorrect TSC synchronization on an SMP system (see dmesg). [can't look
at that, system is hung]
Falling back to a sane timesource now.
Alas, this "sane timesource" didn't help either, system still
not responding right. Alt-SysRq-S said
  SysRq : Emergency Sync
[without any complete messages]
and Alt-SysRq-B did reboot the system.
