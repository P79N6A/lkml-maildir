For that matter, there was a paper from U. Wisconsin showing that
having the journal in the middle of the filesystem gave noticably
better performance due to lower average seek times.  If anyone is
looking at messing with the journal that is probably also a good
and easy place to start (e.g. may be as easy as just giving a goal
block of s_blocks_count / 2 to the journal create code).
