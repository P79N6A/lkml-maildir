It's not a huge problem, it mainly just means that extended PCI Express 
configuration space can't be accessed, and that doesn't seem to be used 
much currently.
Actually, the E820 validation check in mainline currently is too strict 
as the MMCONFIG area is not required to be reserved in the E820 table. 
There's a patch in the -mm tree to validate this against ACPI 
motherboard resources instead, as well as a fix to a PCI probing issue 
that caused problems on some Intel boards with MMCONFIG enabled. You can 
try an -mm kernel and see if this is resolved.
