Just an additional thought..
How about being able to set the link at boot time too - this is for those
sites that have multiple kernels installed (for instance: old reliable,
current reliable, and test). Then each kernel could use different modules
selected at boot time.
This can also be extended to the limited number of applications that
may depend on a particular module version (initialization/table loading/
hardware configuration...) to be selected in a more OS version independant
manner.
I'm thinking of things like the RSBAC security modules and applications that
have to have different versions of the privileged programs depending on the
different versions of the kernel.
