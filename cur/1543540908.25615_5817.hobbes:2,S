    Yes. The correct fix should be to add a
    	atomic_inc(&current->user->processes);
    to just before the atomic_dec(&user->processes). Because we also
    need to increment the root process count and not just decrement
    the process count of whoever happened to do the kmod()..
Despite two other 'success' reports I have a negative here; the
system does boot and run normally -- but when changing runlevels (ie.
to reboot) I get the fork nasties...
