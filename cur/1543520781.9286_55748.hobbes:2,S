	Hello,
	The version included in the kernel is not the same as the gart module
on the CVS of the glx project, you need to checkout the newagp_prerelease
branch on the servGL/hwglx/mga. To do this go to that directory and use cvs
-z3 update -Pd -rnewagp_prerelease, it would be good if you also read the
docs at glx.on.openprojects.com.
