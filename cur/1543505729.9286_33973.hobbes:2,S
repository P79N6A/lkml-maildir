Subject: crashing 2.2.9 and 2.2.10 kernels on Dell Poweredge 2200 PC's
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hello all,
We were seeing crashes about once a day between a couple of machines
running the 2.2.9 and then the 2.2.10.  We only saw console errors on two
crashes, but I did track the EIP value "c015485d" to the function "T
__kfree_skb".  I have backed down to the 2.0.36 kernel and have had no
further problems on either box.
I have no idea how to reproduce the problem.  Interestingly though, one
machine stayed up for about one week until I added additional websites to
it.  The machine was still usually 80-90% idle with less than a load of 2
but the additional activity seems to have made the problem crop up.
I've included a console message I was provided as well as a dmesg so
you can see the hardware involved.
I would appreciate any help in diagnosing this problem.  Thanks!
Jeremy Taylor
