In 2.6.x there is just support for Device Mapper. From "Multi-device
support (RAID and LVM)" you can see:
  x x        <M>   Device mapper support
  x x        [*]     ioctl interface version 4
Both LVM2 and EVMS (from version 2.0.0) use Device Mapper. For LVM2 you
just need to get updated userspace tools from your vendor or directly
from www.sistina.com. For EVMS to work, see:
