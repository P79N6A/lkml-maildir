you are not changing the suspend device after freezing userspace, or i
am getting something horribly wrong here.
so if you have 2 choices of an interface:
1) more complex kernel code, but you can do "echo /dev/name > /proc/foo"
2) less complex kernel code, now you have a userspace helper e.g.
   "suspend_ctl foodev /dev/name" which then does the magic number
   calculations in userspace and puts the magic number into the kernel.
I think that interface 2) would be preferred by most kernel developers.
Especially since this is code only needed on a relatively small subset
of all linux installations.
There is a "top" userspace program to parse kernel numbers, we don't
have "/proc/top".

This is something distributions have to take care of.

not much extra cruft is needed. The "echo resume > /sys/power/state"
just returns (which it wouldn't if the resume was successful), then you
can decide what to do next.

yes. There are other prerequisites for suspend than using an initrd
though (you need a computer :-). If you don't use an initrd, you cannot
use the interactive features but have to decide at compile time which
way to go if the resume fails. That's life.

User-friendlyness is an joint effort of kernel and userspace. The user
does not care who does the work when he clicks on his "hibernation" Icon
in the taskbar. (The same is true for users of an hibernation script).
Actually, the thing that makes suspend2 more reliable than swsusp is
probably the very good hibernation script (userspace) that saves users
the reading of documentation since it automatically unloads all critical
modules etc. For me, pavel's later versions as in SUSE 9.2 have worked
out of the box on every non-SMP i386 notebook i have laid my hands on in
the last 6 months (thanks to userspace taking care of bad modules etc).
