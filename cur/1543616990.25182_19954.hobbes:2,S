Just a short question: the last (add-on) patch to mini-ll I saw on the list
patches: drivers/net/3c59x.c
drivers/net/8139too.c
drivers/net/eepro100.c
Unfortunately me have neither of those. This would mean I cannot benefit from
_these_ patches, but instead would need _others_ (like tulip or
name-one-of-the-rest-of-the-drivers) to see _some_ effect you tell me I
_should_ see (I currently see _none_). How do you argue then against the
statement: we need patches for /drivers/net/*.c ?? I do not expect 3c59x.c to
be particularly bad in comparison to tulip/*.c or lets say via-rhine.c, do you?

Hm, obviously the ll-patches look simple, but their pure required number makes
me think they are as well stupid as simple. This whole story looks like making
an old mac do real multitasking, just spread around scheduling points
throughout the code ... This is like drilling for water on top of the mountain.
I want the water too, but I state there must be a nice valley somewhere around
...

Stephan
