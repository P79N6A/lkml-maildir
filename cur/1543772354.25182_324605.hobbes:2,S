Hi!
I made some test with 2.6.12-rc6-RT-V0.7.48-06 and 2.6.12-rc6 kernels.
Here is my results:
2.6.12-rc6-RT-V0.7.48-0			       2.6.12-rc6
------------------------------------			    ----------------	
./hackbench 30
1st run:  6.139					    5.110	
2nd run: 6.119					   4.946
3rd run: 6.135					    5.168
./hackbench 100
1st run:  23.254				   16.603	
2nd run: 23.481					  16.478
3rd run:  23.790				   16.387
./hackbench 130
1st run:  33.395				   21.731	
2nd run: 32.652					  21.821
3rd run:  32.517				   21.698
./hackbench 150
1st run:  89.100				   47.862	
2nd run: 39.308					  25.121
3rd run:  90.157				   25.125
It seems to me 2.6.12-rc faster than 2.6.12-rc6-RT-V0.7.48-0. It is
normal? 
thanks,
