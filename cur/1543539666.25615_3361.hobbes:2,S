I just discovered a strange thing about the slow performance:
/proc/scsi/adaptec/... show some stats about the number of read/written blocks.
I can see that when the driver slows down the counter for 64K large blocks
stops and the one for 2K blocks starts counting. That's why the driver writes
slowly, but why it does so ????
Bye.
