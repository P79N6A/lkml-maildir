oh, nice to see that this is still alive.
i tried this around half a year ago because i needed more than 256 loop devices and iirc, this was working quite fine.
at least i got no crashes and was able to mount and acess more than 300 iso-images with that.
shortly after, loop device was extended to handle  a larger number of loop-devices and i went that way because dm-loop was not in mainline.
i have taken a look at the wiki at 
http://sources.redhat.com/lvm2/wiki/DMLoop
 from time to time, but there didn`t seem to happen much.
were there fixes/chances since then?
do you think it`s ready for mainline?
