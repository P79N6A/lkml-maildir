There appears to be several people claiming that a bigger kdev_t
breaks compatibility with lots of programs, and I find this rather
hard to understand, so can somebody explain this to me please?
In particular, please explain what's wrong with implementing a 32-bit
or 64-bit kdev_t defined such that nodes where all except the bottom
16 bits are zero, it is defined as a "compatibility node"?
As an example, and assuming a 32-bit kdev_t split into 16-bit major
and 16-bit minor fields, the 16-bit major 0 would be defined this way,
and would be treated as being the equivalent of the current node
numbers recast as a 16-bit minor with the major 0.
Best wishes from Riley.
