Then better separate the two, keeping the technical discussion on LKML and
taking the development model stuff elsewhere.

First step: Axe them. They are (at most) /configuration options/, that will
have to get fixed meanings, available to all ReiserFS filesystems purely
for compatibility reasons. Sure, do get wild on new options in your own
experimental trees, and migrate what survives into the standard version
(and then it'll be ReiserFS 4.1, 4.2, ..., 4.25, ...).

Sounds reasonable.

How would that work out from the userland (system call) perspective? How
does that get handled from on-disk format?

But procfs /is/ quite special, as it is supposed to be a window into the
kernel, not real files. Some layering violation is unavoidable there.

Only what makes sense. Plus many of those will probably have to go. Decide
on /one/ way of doing things, even if not perfect for all uses. Everything
else is useless bloat.
