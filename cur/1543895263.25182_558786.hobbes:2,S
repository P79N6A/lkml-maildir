Yes.  And this was precisely what meant when I wrote "quid-pro-quo"
above.

/me hands Linus a mirror
Serious, what's so hard to understand about:
  no tivoization => more users able to tinker their formerly-tivoized
  computers => more users make useful modifications => more
  contributions in kind
?
Sure, there's a downside too:
  no tivoization => fewer contributions from manufacturers that demand
  on tivoization
My perception is that the first easily dominates the second, and so
you are better off without tivoization.

Wrong.  It enables copyright holders to decide whether forgiveness is
appropriate, rather than forcing them to forgive.  Being forced to
forgive deception is not tit-for-tat, and it's a losing strategy.
