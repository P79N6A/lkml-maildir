Ted said recently (on the linux-fsdevel list, subject Re: [linux-lvm]
lvm-0.6, Linux 2.2.9) that it'd be "18 months from final acceptance"...
"basically during 1st quarter 2000". He's "looking into whether or not
PowerQuest could be persuaded into releasing it earlier", since work is
underway to replicate it.
See

 for details.

I wonder how many people bought Partition Magic because of Ted's ext2
resizer?
Do we want Linux to remain a hacker's OS forever?

We should start planning for it now, then ;-)
