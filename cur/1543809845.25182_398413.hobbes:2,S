If they just usb_gadget_register_driver(), that's how it's defined to
work yes.  (Though a spec lawyer might want more explicit language ...)

And the unbind functions __exit/__exit_p()?  Smaller runtime footprints
are good.  I don't like leaving the driver->init() method invalid, which
is I think why I didn't do that before, but saving space is the right
thing to do.

Right; that marking is for infrastructure, not drivers.
