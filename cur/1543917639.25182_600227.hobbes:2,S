If it's just this card, then I would have to conclude that it is indeed

(I'm afraid we can't just ignore the version field as there have been
several changes in the past where new version means no backward

I'd be very cautious about using those then. Since they obviously just
assume they can use any card you stick in there, it's a good chance
they'll start eating your data when never cards hit the market.
