Yeah, and also goes a long way towards explaining why my documentation
changes never went anywhere. 
They are wrong for 2.3, but mostly right for 2.2.
Shall I resubmit them as a patch to 2.2 documentation, taking out the stuff
about check_/request_/release_*_region? Or am I still misunderstanding
something in the 2.2 kernel?

Actually, this isn't what I understood Martin to have told me. I had written
him on this exact point to get clarification.
It is a 'converted BAR', not the value in the PCI BAR. It is the physical
address on that system bus, although someone mentioned this should probably
be treated more as a cookie in order to be architechure neutral.
In any case, on 2.2.x I was told that it was the value to pass into
ioremap().

Great. Sounds like someone should document this somewhere.
Going to make for a reasonable amount of ifdefs() in drivers that are used
on both 2.2 and the development kernel. Yuck.
