Writing a device driver for a IO card, I have the following message from
the kernel:
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 000d0804.
[then it gives the register values]
Segmentation fault."
This address (0xd0804) is the location of a "mailbox" reserved by the IO
card, and from which commands are passed to the card.
My question: is the kernel using or protecting this area of the memory,
and is there a way to deprotect it??? (how dangerous!)
Thanks
Guillaume
