Well, but the only time you should need to alter a priori knowledge like
this is if you're actually altering the NUMA topology, isn't it?  Simply
bringing up a CPU in a known numa system shouldn't need to alter
scheduling domain information on CPU hotplug because the cpu
automatically becomes part of an existing domain (where it was
originally accounted for as missing).
However, if you hotplug a numa node, then you're adding to the
scheduling domain and would thus need to initialise the new node and its
CPUs.
