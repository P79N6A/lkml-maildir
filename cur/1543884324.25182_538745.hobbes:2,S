Hi David,
	If they're really unused, they should be deleted, not
warning-suppressed.  The interesting case is where they may or may not
be used because of config options.  ie. they're optional.
	__maybe_unused does not, at a glance, tell me that it's OK for gcc to
drop them.  __optional comes closer.  However, it's better than
__unused, so I'll stop now 8)
Thanks,
Rusty.
