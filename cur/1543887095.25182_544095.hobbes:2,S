Worthy goal, indeed, but you've yourself pointed out later in your mail
why this may not be possible for a compiler/assembler to guarantee safely
(in a sense that the programmer usually wants, anyway), even with the C
standard-blessed "volatile" type-qualifier, what with the *hardware*
optimizing memory accesses _independently_ at a granularity finer than
the "sequence points" understood by a compiler.

The way I read it, "What constitutes an access to an object that has
volatile-qualified type is implementation-defined" is the standard's way
of saying: "All bets are off." Actually I wonder how the various _compiler
implementations_ read this clause (and whether *all* of them read it
consistently and equally, which is what a portable codebase probably
wants), because _their_ interpretation of this clause is more important
than mine, after all. But I don't really see how generic C code that uses
"volatile" can also claim dialect-independence.
So, IMO, the trouble with the volatile type-qualifier is that it is (what
should have been defined as in the first place, and what is in effect)
a _compiler extension_ *masquerading* as a _language keyword_.
*Unfortunately* (the trouble with C itself, is that a *committee* has made
it into ... something ... that it should not have made it into) -- anyway,
unfortunately C took it upon itself to solve a problem that it did not
have (and does not even bring about) in the first place: and the
half-hearted (or vague, call it what you will) attempt _then_ ends up
being a problem -- by making people _feel_ as if they are doing things
right, when that is probably not the case.
[ And we've not even touched the issue of whether the _same_ compiler's
implementation of volatile across archs/platforms is consistent. ]

Exactly. So this combined with the issue above, is the last nail in volatile's
coffin as far as I'm concerned.

Yes, but I'd prefer to stick to the straight-and-narrow (well-defined-and-
well-understood), and avoid volatile altogether. The kernel codebase does
contain APIs that allow one to avoid it and are also what one probably
wants for most situations.

Yeah, I agree with the wording above, also with Jimmy's summary that Jeff
and Peter agreed to already.
