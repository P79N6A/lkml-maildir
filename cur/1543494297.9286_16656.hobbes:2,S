That was the first thing I noticed in his article. He talks a lot about
benchmarks, about how Linux "isn't there -- yet" ... but he does _not_
provide the benchmark results to back him up. However, I didn't want to
reply to him myself because I wouldn't know how to discuss more specific
issues with him (as you, mingo, have done in this reply). Thanks for
clarifying all these issues to me (and to him too ;) !!

Ok, if you (and others) have already contacted him and showed him these
fallacies, good. However, I think there should be a _public_ place where
this clarification is available. Otherwise, misinformed people who read
this article will have the wrong idea of Linux, and they won't have any
other place that tells them otherwise.
Anyhow, thanks for your helpful reply again !!
