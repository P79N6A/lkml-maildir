Hi,
I must admit that Alpha is a few more out of sync than it deserves.

That's really a bad hack, if i386 kmap types match up with your 
expectations, you must be a lucky guy. i386 and alpha are still 100% 
different machines.

It wasn't introduced, I guess.

Yes, the syntax changed.

The NULL only needs to be non-NULL if we clone with CLONE_CLEARTID.
