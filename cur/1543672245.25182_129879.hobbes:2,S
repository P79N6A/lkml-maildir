We just had a similar battle regarding LSM extended attributes on files,
the biggest problem being what a module should do if it doesn't understand
the formats and semantics of the previous module...
It's certainly *doable* - the telcos have been doing this since whichever
of the SSn systems was first programmable rather than hardwire logic.  The
big question is whether it will still look like Linux if you implement it.
