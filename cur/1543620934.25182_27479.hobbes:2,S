I'd rather provide a function to obtain the base address of the ISA hole,
while would also allow us to
 - Return an error when it doesn't exist (a given kernel may or may not
have it depending on which box it's booted, it can't be a compile time
option)
 - Eventually obtain a per-PCI bus ISA hole (the "legacy one" beeing
defined as bus or with a special constant) so multi domain machines
can use multiple VGA cards (eek eek ;)
With that, at least PPC don't require isa_xxx specific functions/macros
(but I can't tell about other archs).
Ben.
