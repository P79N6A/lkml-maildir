A floating-point '==' tests for the two oprands to be exact. The
only time they will be exact is:
   float a, b;
   a = b = 10.000;
  At this instant a = b and (a==b) will return TRUE.
  However, if by previous math, you expected a to equal 10.0, by
  doing:
  a = b = 10.00
  a += 12345.678;
  a -= 12345.678;
  Now, 'a' is not equal to 'b' if the 'C' compiler actually performed
  the indicated operations (the compiler may obtimize them away).
  In this case (a==b) will return FALSE because they are not equal.

So, as you can see, when first initialized with the same value,
regardless of how inaccurately in can be represented, it does
show equality.
However, as soon as I muck with it, add, then subtract the same
number, it will no longer be egual.
This is why you NEVER use '==' when dealing with floating-point
numbers. The use of '==' in floating-point operations is a bug.
'C' allows you to write buggy code. It will probably call
a floating-point compare routine in the FPU (fcom, fcomp, fcompp)
which will promptly return the 'not-equal' in C1 and the CPU flags.
'C' will even allow you to use floating-point numbers in loops, i.e.,
     while(a--)
       do_something_forever();
Just because it's allowed, it doesn't mean that it's not a bug.
