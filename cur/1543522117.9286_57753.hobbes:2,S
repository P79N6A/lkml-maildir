What libc are you using?
glibc 2.1's getpagesize() should work correctly, have checked it.
If getpagesize() does not work correctly, then you should IMHO fix
getpagesize(), not break mkswap. Because if you just set pagesize =
PAGE_SIZE, then you're horribly broken because you'll have to use different
binaries for sun4, sun4c/d/m and sun4u.
