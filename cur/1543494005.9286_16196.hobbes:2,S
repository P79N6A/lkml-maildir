Thanks, Dave.  When you combine this startup adaptation with something
analogous happening at the trellis-coding level, it can be nasty.  :-}
It's been awhile since I've analyzed tcpdump output, but the packet loss I
saw appeared at various points in the transmission, not just near the
beginning; perhaps some ongoing adaptation is looking for decreased
congestion?  If so, it might be handy to be able to tune it, a suitable
default through /proc maybe.

Ah ha, so that's why 2.0 worked so well!  Back to 2.0.37p11.  :-)  OK, maybe
not...
