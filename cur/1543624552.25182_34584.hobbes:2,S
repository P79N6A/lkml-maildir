Again, this is not needed, there are two ways at doing this. One is to
traverse the segments and setup the drive for the full transfer with
write (or read) multi. Drive will expect nr_sectors transfer and do it
xx sectors of the time as programmed by set multi. The other approach is
what I tried last time (but with the early-interrupt fixed), just
program the drive for no more than current_nr_sectors and simply let the
command request nr_sectors / current_nr_sectors times.
The latter approach also satisfies 'the hardware atomic' as you call it.

No the fact is that you _think_ only a few people understand the
problem.
