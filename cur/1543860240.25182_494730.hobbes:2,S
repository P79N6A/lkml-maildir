- Is this code in some fast path? If so, I'd set up a constant array that
  is memcpy()'d over the variable (or used to initialize it) as needed.
- If not, what is the point? Shaving off a few bytes/cycles and paying for
  that with massive developer confusion? What if the constant changes and
  is -2, or 1, tomorrow?
