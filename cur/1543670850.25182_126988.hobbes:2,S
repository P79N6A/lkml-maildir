Hmmm, scratch, scratch ... there is something I still don't get here. 
I am in lockless_commit() - for what you say, and what I read, I would 
then expect the length of the sub-buffer would be mapped to user space, 
so I can memcpy out of the mmaped area and then take only the part that
is guaranteed to be consistent. But the atomic_add() is done on the 
rchan->scheme.lockless.fillcount[buffer_number]. So, I don't see how
that count pops out to user space, as rchan->buf to rchan->buf + rchan->
alloc_size is what is mapped, and rchan is a kernel-only struct that
is not exposed through mmap().
Where is the Easter bunny I am missing? Would you mind to give a little bit
of pseudocode? I am trying to understand how to do this:
/* in userspace */
char *buf;
int fd; /* for the channel */
int log_fd; /* for permanent storage */
/* open, blah ... */
buf = mmap (... fd ... 1M ...);
if (new stuff is ready /* how to detect, select() on fd? */) {
	/* bring the data to safety, copy only what is consistent */
	real_size = /* or where do I get this from? */
	write (log_fd, buf, real_size);
}
And then, once I have this, next time I read I don't want to read
what I already did; I guess I can advance my buf pointer to 
buf+real_size, but then how do I wrap around - meaning, how do I
detect when do I have to wrap?

Good try :) As I said somewhere else, that'd be up to the client. Wanna
use kmalloc()? or kmem_cache_alloc()? or something else? I guess it'd 
be convenient to provide a pre-implemented circular buffer thingie ready
to use.
I guess the suballocation makes sense when you have a fixed message size
and you want to optimize the allocation; for that matter, kmalloc is no
different to any other pool, as they are just pools of base-2 sizes. In
some other sense, you are doing the same in relayfs, managing kind of
an allocation pool, but not as flexible (and thus probably faster) because
the usage model doesn't pose as many requirements as the memory pools have.
