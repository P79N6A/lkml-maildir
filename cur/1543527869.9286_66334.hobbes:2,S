NO!  They may not even be aware they're running it.  Just look at all the
crap most distributions turn on in inetd.conf.  I'll grant the administrator
_should_ have looked at that after installation, but most don't.
(I've been yelled at before for assuming the admin had a clue.  In my case,
 it was all the open NFS servers on campus.  I assumed everyone with nfsd's
 exporting things to "everyone" meant to do so.  I was even non-milicious
 enough to ignore everything that looked like an AFS-to-NFS translator -- I
 knew how unstable that thing was(is?) [even Transarc told people not to
 use it.])
