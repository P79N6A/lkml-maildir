Asus A7V is Via KT133 based, right? It has additional Promise ide
controller?

Stock 2.4.18, no patches? Which filesystem are you using? Ext2, ext3, other?

So the harddisk is connected to Promise, not Via? You have no other
harddisks?

I had enormous trouble with a KT133(A or not) based mobo (Abit-KT7(A)-RAID
in past - it would just corrupt data when transferring big files from the
additional ide controller (HPT370 in this case). The Via ide controller
didn't show this behaviour.
- This happened on 2.2.20, 2.4.15, 2.4.18preX + ide-patch.
- Memtest86 showed nothing
- Network activity seemed to have to do with it
- Changing the NIC to another PCI slot and tweaking bios params seemed to
  help, but eventually it happened again
- I eventually concluded that KT133 corrupts PCI transfers under load, which
  was found out by others in 'net as well. 
- Tried bios updates and contacting Via, Highpoint, Abit. Highpoint and Abit
  never cared to answer. Neither did Via until I spotted an Via employee on
  viahardware.com forum. She said they'd investigate the issue, never heard
  of her since.
- Ditched the mobo fo good, bought an Abit ST6R, and never had a problem
  since. You may be lucky just switching the drive to Via ide.
First reports on the corruption:

There was a long thread on forums.viahardware.com as well
(

),
but it seems they have sensored it away for good.
I've also received reports of similar experiences from a number of people
since I wrote to linux-kernel about this.
I repoduced the problem with wrchk utility I wrote
(
http://iki.fi/v/tmp/wrchk.c
) but it seems you can do it with you directory
tree copying.
