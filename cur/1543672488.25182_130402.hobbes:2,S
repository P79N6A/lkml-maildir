Hi,
Here's some patches that fix the pci hotplug drivers so that they now
work again.  Sorry it's taken so long to get these done...
I've also included a patch from Torben Mathiasen that adds PCI-X support
to the Compaq PCI Hotplug driver.  This patch is in the 2.4 tree
already.  There are also a few other minor fixes and cleanups in this
fixing build configurations, and removing unused variables.
Please pull from:  bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/pci-2.5
thanks,
greg k-h
