I'll stay on-list just in case, it's better to have feedback.
I think you want to take everything that belongs in the kernel and put it 
under a subdirectory, say, "kernel", and lay it out exactly as it would be if
your patch were accepted into linus's tree.  That is, the headers go in 
kernel/include/linux, the modules in kernel/drivers/asterisk/whichever.
It nests your tree more deeply, but it's going to end up like that anyway
(you hope) so it might as well be that way now.
