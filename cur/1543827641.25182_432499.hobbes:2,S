Well, so everyone can send email through an MTA (the email accounts
"home MTA") covered in the SPF records.

What makes you believe that the domains you heard of are setup
correctly?
Of course for some/several/many of them you know (because you or
trustfully people administrate them or the domain setup look like sane
to the rest of the world), but for other (including "well known")
domains and in the long run?
If the point was: "We want tolerate ill-adminned domains."
That depends on the error hypotheses and which ill behaviour one wants
to tolerate ......
> Earth can set it up" helps not an iota, they sure will.
I'm not designing (or propagating) anything for dumb admins (they will
screw up anything anyways and an admin knows per definition what s/he is
doing) but it is enough for sane (but also overloaded - so it should not
be too much of a hassle) admins.
