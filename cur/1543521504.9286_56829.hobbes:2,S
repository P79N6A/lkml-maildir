Running 2.2.14pre18 on a customers machine, it slowly grinded to
a halt after the following message:
Jan  9 19:38:12 red kernel: kmem_alloc: Bad slab magic (corrupt) (name=vm_area_s
truct) 
Jan  9 19:38:43 red last message repeated 425 times
Jan  9 19:38:50 red last message repeated 24 times
Jan  9 19:38:50 red kernel: kmem_free: Bad obj addr (objp=d3e4fe80, name=vm_area
_struct) 
Jan  9 19:38:50 red kernel: Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 
virtual address 00000000 
Jan  9 19:38:50 red kernel: current->tss.cr3 = 00101000, %cr3 = 00101000 
Jan  9 19:38:50 red kernel: *pde = 00000000 
Jan  9 19:38:50 red kernel: Oops: 0002 
Jan  9 19:38:50 red kernel: CPU:    0 
This happened after we replaced the motherboard of the machine, and
upgraded from 2.0.37 to 2.2.14pre8. It could point to bad RAM, but
that had been running fine in the old motherboard for months.
Any ideas what could cause this?
Thanks for any insights
Mike.
