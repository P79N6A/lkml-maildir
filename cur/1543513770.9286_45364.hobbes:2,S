When I have to kill -9 X, is there anyway (w/o rebooting, the box has been
up for 73 days on 2.2.10 SMP) to get the console back the way it was after
the machine boots?  I've upgraded the kernel to 2.2.13 but don't see a need
to reboot (the console isn't that big of a deal, but would like to fix it).
I'm sure someone else has been in this situation where the console is
completely messed up and would like to have it back w/o booting.
