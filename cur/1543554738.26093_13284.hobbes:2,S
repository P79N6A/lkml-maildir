Occasionally I am getting the follow error on my system:
(scsi0:0:0:-1) Unexpected busfree, LASTPHASE = 0x40, SEQADDR = 0x66
Read : (10) 00 4f a0 07 00 00 20 00 
scsi0 channel 0 : resetting for second half of retries.
SCSI bus is being reset for host 0 channel 0.
SCSI host 0 channel 0 reset (pid 0) timer out - trying harder.
SCSI bus is being reset for host 0 channel 0.
SCSI host 0 reset (pid 0) timed out again -
probably an unrecoverable SCSI bus or device hang.
(scsi0:0:0:0) Synchronous at 160.0 Mbytes/sec, offset 63.
Device 804 not ready
 I/O error: dev 08:04, sector 1621936
...etc
I typed in the above since it was not saved in my log file, so it might be
missing some stuff, but nothing that seemed to be needed. 
After that I get a bunch of I/O errors and the system remounts read-only.
Also, after this error has occurred it always happens until I reboot the
system, and sometime I even have to go into the adaptec bios and do nothing
to get it back to working order (I don't change anything in the bios).
I don't think it is the drive, this is the second drive I have tried.  It
might be and controller or cable problem, but it happen so randomly I can't
pin it down.  The adapter is an Adaptec 29160 and I use the internal LVD
cable that came with the card.  My kernel version is 2.4.0-test8. Could this
be a kernel problem?  I've seen it mentioned a couple of time in the past.
Any suggestions?
Andy
