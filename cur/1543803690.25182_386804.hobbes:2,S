Ok, that's good. It means the ACPI PM clocksource is doing the right
thing.

Ok, this points to the TSC is changing frequency (likely due to C3
halting).

Ok, good, interrupts are getting there at the right frequency.

Well, it would have re-inforced the TSC being the issue, but I'm fairly
confident that that is the case.
My theory: The stalls are due to the TSC frequency not being consistent
for the small window at boot between when it is installed and when the
ACPI PM clocksource is installed.
I'll try to narrow that window down a bit and see if that doesn't
resolve the issue.
