Subject: [2.6 PATCH] visor: Don't count outstanding URBs twice
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Guys, can you please CC me when discussing patches of mine? I don't read
LKML religiously, and my procmail filters are pretty dumb. Thanks. So
my previous patch fixed the oops, but the driver's still borked.
Incrementing the outstanding_urbs counter twice for the same URB can't
be good. No wonder Simon didn't get far syncing his Palm.
