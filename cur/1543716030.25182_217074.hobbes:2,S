Another thing I think XFS could make good use of on the generic
buffered IO path would be mpage_readpages and mpage_writepages
variants that can use a get_blocks_t (like the direct IO path)
instead of the single-block-at-a-time get_block_t interface thats
used now.  The existence of such beasts would probably impact the
direction xfs_aops.c takes a fair bit I'd guess Christoph?
cheers.
