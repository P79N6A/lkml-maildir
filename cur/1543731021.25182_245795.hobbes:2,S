In principle, not all of them. For example, a document summary 
for a text document or a long (textual) description of a video 
clip might remain the same when the user is only working on the 
finishing details.
Maybe the metadata needs an attribute to determine how 
'immutable' it should be wrt changes on the file? (Can you 
spell meta-meta-data <g>)
