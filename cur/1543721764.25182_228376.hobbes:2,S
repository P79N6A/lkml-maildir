Andreas,
We precisely use this mechanism - we use 
/lib/modules/<version>/build/include/linux/config.h to figure such features out
but when the "build" part of the path doesn't point to the right source tree,
where do you look?. SuSE ships kernel sources "unconfigured" which means that
you have to rely on something else to tell you what the exact kernel
configuration looks like.
You can look at /proc/config.gz but that's not a standard on all distros either.
best regards
