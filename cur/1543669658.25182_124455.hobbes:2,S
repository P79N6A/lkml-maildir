Well the "real-world" parallels at a much higher voltage. You
probably want a single power supply per drive, which eliminates
any single-point failure problems and allows you to use standard
stuff. To keep the heat-load down, you need to distribute the
drives over several large racks anyway. That allows you to get
perhaps 5 kW per rack if you use 9 racks so things are more
reasonable.
