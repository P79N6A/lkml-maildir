THat's unfortunate.

I ran the following simple test on the 4P system with TSC
gtod for a week:
while true; do date; sleep 3600; done
the first entry went in at July 13 15:39:48, the last entry
at  July 25 15:39:50.  A drift of 2 seconds over 12 days is 
within specification, I believe.
In contrast, the same machine running with TSC and standard
PN! sees massive drift, upwards of an hour, within an hour.
If the TSCnow! patch reduces measured drift down to a second 
a week, would you consider that acceptable?
