It's not just the disks made in Hungary, I've had 3 IBM drives go bad on me
in the last week after 3-4 months of operation 2 15GB 75GXPs made in
Thailand (bad sectors), 1 40GB 40GV also made in Thailand (started making
bad scratching noise, BIOS wouldn't detect it after that).  Still have a
number of the 75GXPs in service, but I'm keeping my eye on them.
Kristian's problem looks like it could be hardware problems of some sort
leading to corruption.
