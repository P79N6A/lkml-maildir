  i don't know what you're getting at here.  are you saying this is a
bad idea because it will make a mess of the current usage of
CONFIG_EMBEDDED in the source tree?
$ grep -rw CONFIG_EMBEDDED *
... lots of irrelevant defconfig output deleted ...
drivers/pci/setup-res.c:#ifdef CONFIG_EMBEDDED
include/linux/ide.h:#if !defined(MAX_HWIFS) || defined(CONFIG_EMBEDDED)
$
  i don't see a whole lot of impact here.  more to the point, though,
the word "EMBEDDED" in this context is just wrong.  people might have
*other* reasons to de-activate some of those features rather than just
for an embedded system.
  granted, that's probably where it will *mostly* happen, but i prefer
the idea of labelling those selections for what they really are -- for
*saving* *space*, because that's exactly what they represent.
