I might add that you'd drag a devoted developer into the kernel team more 
closely, which probably makes up for the 'added complexity' anyway.
The gain in working *together* on suspend2 is worth much more than the 'added 
complexity' Pavel complains about. Nigel has stated more than once that he'd 
be happy to maintain suspend2, and he's done so for quite some time already, 
which proves his point. Nigel is paid to work on suspend2, so it's not likely 
to go away once he has a new hobby (and again, he's been doing great work for 
some time already). 
So what about working on merging suspend2 finally? Having a proven, stable and 
feature-rich implemenation available quickly, *and* someone who maintains 
*and* support it actively does not sound like a bad deal to me.
One should not underestimate the gains that a suspend2 merge has on the 
development merely by stating 'added complexity', that pays off _any_day_.
By the way, does 'working on uswsusp' mean that Pavel and will put less work 
in maintaining swsusp? That does not sound too promising to my sore ears.
Personally, to work with, I'd prefer a developer who's responsibly dealing 
with users' questions and problems any day to one who rejects 99% of emails 
that don't contain a patch and 95% of those that contain one, stating 'WTF, I 
don't like that'.
Bottom line: Judging developer resources only by lines of code added does not 
make too much sense.
