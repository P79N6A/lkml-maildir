I've done a little digging, and you're right, it doesn't happen with
*all* wav files.  Here's a random example of a file with which it does
happen on my machine:

Well, I'm using tcsh and according to bindkey, Control-C is bound to
tty-sigintr.  I get the exact same behavior if I send a "kill -INT
<pid>" remotely.  I've noticed that the SIGINT actually does stop the
sound eventually, it's just not immediate.
Thanks,
Navin.
