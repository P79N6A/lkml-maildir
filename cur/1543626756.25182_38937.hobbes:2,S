	a) where the hell is update to Documentation/filesystems/* ?
	b) Dave, meet grep.  grep, meet Dave.  Have a happy relationship...
_Please_, grep before doing global changes.  Trivial search for
notify_change() would show several calls under ->i_sem.  E.g. one
in fs/nfsd/vfs.c.  Or in hpfs_unlink().
All other problems with BKL brigade aside, could you at least learn to
use basic tools?  It's not a rocket science, after all - you do global
interface changes, you need to do global search.
