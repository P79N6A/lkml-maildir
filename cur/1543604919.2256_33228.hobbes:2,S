Hi,
I did a build with the patch-2.4.13-pre2.pz applied but it didn't fixed
the problem. Your suggestion to add a line in sonypi.c however did work.
Now I also have the same problem as Eyal Lebedinskynew:
make -C i2o modules
make[2]: Entering directory `/home/src/linux-2.4.12/drivers/i2o'
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/home/src/linux-2.4.12/include -Wall
-Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer
-fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2
-march=i686 -DMODULE -DMODVERSIONS -include
/home/src/linux-2.4.12/include/linux/modversions.h   -DEXPORT_SYMTAB -c
i2o_pci.c
i2o_pci.c: In function `i2o_pci_install':
i2o_pci.c:165: structure has no member named `pdev'
make[2]: *** [i2o_pci.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/src/linux-2.4.12/drivers/i2o'
make[1]: *** [_modsubdir_i2o] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/src/linux-2.4.12/drivers'
make: *** [_mod_drivers] Error 2
Has anyone a suggestion?
Thanks,
Sander
