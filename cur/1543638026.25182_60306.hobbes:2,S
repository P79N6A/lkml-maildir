A little research will show that the governments have little to
do with design. Governments just tend to determine what will
be designed. Most designers, Engineers, Architects, etc., design
in spite of governments influence, not because of it. Both governments
and consumers generate markets for products. When consumers make
mistakes, people lose their jobs. When governments make mistakes people
lose their lives. Government is both necessary and dangerous, like oxygen.
