Does the PCI Express AER specification define an API for drivers?

Likewise, with EEH the device driver could take recovery action on its
own.  But we don't want to end up with multiple sets of recovery code
in drivers, if possible.  Also we want the recovery code to be as
simple as possible, otherwise driver authors will get it wrong.

The AER driver would be be closely involved in the recovery process.
What is the state of a link during the time between when an error is
detected and when a link reset is done?  Is the link usable?  What
happens if you try to do a MMIO read from a device downstream of the
link?

Paul.
