   I was looking through the ext2 source code, and I found EXE2_UNRM_FL which
   (I think ) will make the file with this flag undeletable (or recoverable).
   Is this thing ever implemented ? or if this flag works, where is the code
   for it? Thanx in advance.
Nope, it's not implemented, and it isn't really a priority to implement
either, to be honest.  There are a number of fairly good user-mode "rm"
replaces that provide this kind of functionality, though!
