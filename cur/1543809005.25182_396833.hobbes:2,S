Changes to the interface in this version of quilt broke gquilt (a GUI 
wrapper for quilt) and if you use gquilt and upgrade to this version of 
quilt you will also need to upgrade to version 0.17 of gquilt.  It is 
available in source form at:
<
http://users.bigpond.net.au/Peter-Williams/gquilt-0.17.tar.gz>
and rpm form at:
<
http://users.bigpond.net.au/Peter-Williams/gquilt-0.17-1.noarch.rpm>
Enjoy,
Peter
