Why?  I can see plenty of uses where I want a filesystem generated by
one user to be accessible by other users.  That policy should not be
hard-coded into the kernel.  It might be an option.

Why?  Surely you want to prevent writing to files which don't have the
writable bit set?  A filesystem may also create append-only files -
and all users including the mount owner should be bound by that.

This is the root of the conflict.  You are trying to overload the
permission bits and uid/gid to mean something different than they
normally do.
While it's convenient to see some "remote" information such as the
uid/gid in a tar file, are you sure it's a good idea to break the unix
permissions model - which will break some programs?  (For example, try
editing a file with the broken semantics in an editor which checks the
uid/gid of the file against the current user).
For most virtual filesystems, the "remote" information does not map to
uid/gid in a particularly natural way anyway.  So it seems odd to want
to break the unix permissions model just so that a small _subset_ of
virtual filesystems can use stat() as a way to get a bit of
information out, when other virtual filesystems (e.g. webdavfs) can't
put meaningful information in there, and would benefit from normal
unix permissions instead.

Seems good - but why not sticky?  Mounting a user filesystem in
/tmp/user-xxx/my-mount-point seems not unreasonable - provided the
administrator can delete the directory (which is possible with
detachable mount points).

Of course.  Ideally, make sure they appear to be set in /proc/mounts.
(root (or equivalent) should be able to create virtual filesystems
without these options, but probably they should be set by default even
for root, and clearable using suid,dev).

Bad.  How do I, user A, then create a virtual filesystem which I want
user B to be able to access?

I like the idea that the fs daemon doesn't need elevated permissions.

Dangerous, because an administrative program might actually trust the
attributes to mean what they normally mean in the unix permissions model.

Ok, but why do you prevent the useful behaviour of allowing access to
other users, when I want that?  For example, I might export my current
project's database as a filesystem that I _want_ other users to be
able to read.

I agree with Christoph.  It is a huge deviation from the unix
permissions model -- and it seems to prevent some useful applications
of FUSE so it's not clear why you want it.
