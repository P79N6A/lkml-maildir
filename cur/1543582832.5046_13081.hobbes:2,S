Hi all,
I did some further investigation and found the following:
It seems to me that this is a linux <-> solaris problem. I have no
problems with AIX 4.1.4, IRIX 6.5 or WIN2K. However all solaris boxes
I have access to (2.6, 7, 8, sparc and intel) give me a "connection
closed" after 2h, which is (at least I blelieve so ;-) the TCP timer
for keepalive.
Tell me if I can provide you with further data to nail down this bug.
Jes: I thought about your information that ssh connections do not show
this problem. I believe you are using ssh 2.3 or 2.4 from ssh.com,
right? 2.3 introduced a rekeying-feature which exchanges new keys
every 60 minutes, so the TCP keepalive is never triggered. (Due to a
bug which is still present in 2.4, we can't use these versions at my
site.)
HTH.
Regards,
        Markus
