Subject: [BUG] 2.6.0-test2 loses time on 486

My old 486 test box is losing time at an alarming rate
when running 2.6.0-test kernels. It loses almost 2 minutes
per hour, less if it sits idle. This problem does not
occur when it's running a 2.4 kernel.
There's nothing noteworthy in dmesg.
This has been going on since at least the 2.5.7x kernels,
and possible also the 2.5.6x kernels. I strongly suspect
a bug in the time-keeping changes in late 2.5 kernels.
The 486 has no TSC, and I don't have an NTP server to
keep my machines' times in sync.
