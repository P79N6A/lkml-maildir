No, at this stage the code reboots the machine (well, I could call the ide
reset code at this point I guess).
Note that my mini oops dumper object file is a leafnode which doesn't use any
external code in the dump path (checked at build time).  It is armed with the
symbols and device & block offsets by userspace.  I plan to update it in the
next month, but it's trivial enough (a new driver with one hook in the oops
code) to be done after the freeze if reqd.
The interesting bit becomes harvesting those reports: this is a higher level
problem (userspace and privacy being the higher levels, respectively).
