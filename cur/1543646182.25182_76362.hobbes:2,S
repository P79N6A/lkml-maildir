The code in question (LiS) is LGPL and open source.  The iBCS
packge is GPL and open source.
You do know that there *is* open source code which is not
contained in the Linux kernel ;)
So, in this case, GPL and LGPL modules do have a problem linking
with the sys_call_table (on RH 8.0 and I suppose some
development kernels only), because the symbol is no longer
exported and no registration procedure was provided for
registering otherwise non-implemented system calls (in
particular the UNIX98 and iBCS/ABI standard putmsg/getmsg
calls).
And what about AFS?  I see that it uses a sys_ni_syscall slot as
well...
In fact all these components are opensource.
