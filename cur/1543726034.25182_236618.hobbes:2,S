   me neither (well, few times iPod locked up and I had to do the two 
finger salute (hold, then menu&play)), I just don't want it to connect 
in the first place, the reason being that once it connects it looses the 
track of random tracks (so that they start from scratch and then i get 
repeated songs) and from time to time contrast (and I almost can't see 
display with default contrast so I have to set the contrast again). not 
really a big deal but inconvenient.
   I know I can just handle the loading of the modules manually but I'd 
rather have it handled by the system (plus loading and unloading of 
modules manually has to be done by admin while automatic load/unload 
works for any user)
   And, of course, what's the point in having drivers loaded for devices 
I only use occasionally (iPod, digital camera)

   yeah, I've read some of it on lkml and elsewhere, just don't think 
it's a good idea. Sometime you just don't want the module loaded (one 
example is my usage of iPod), memory is only one (sometime, maybe often, 
negligible) reason.
   This looks like one of those 90% solutions that are so annoying (and 
that are fairly rare in free (libre) software which I personally use in 
large part because of its flexibility).
