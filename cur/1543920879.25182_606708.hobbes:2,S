Yeah, this particular one really should only bite you with 
DEBUG_PAGEALLOC.
The SG code potentially _derefences_ a field past the end of the SG array, 
but it should be a read, and the result should never be used (it's used to 
calculate the pointer to past the end of the queue, so if it's used, 
there's another bug lurking).

Please do. I wouldn't be surprised if it's also related to the SG changes, 
but I don't think it's the exact particular bug that Ingo saw.
