Ok I meant in the "while adhering to the standard" :)

this has a bug, the 1024 is wrong... what if your "p" point actually
spans 2 pages? 
but to have "some effect" even for malloc-falling-back-to-mmap..
just there's a bunch of collateral damage since you mprotect more than
just the memory you got from malloc. mprotect works on page size.. so if
p spans 2 pages (why wouldn't it ;) you mprotect either the wrong memory
(as in your example) or too much (eg both pages)...
