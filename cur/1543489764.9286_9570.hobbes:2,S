	Looking at the output from cat /proc/<pid>/maps I get this:

	I assume the /dev/mem entries are the mmap of the frame buffer(s)?  The
lspci entry for the TNT card is:
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Nvidia Corporation: Unknown device 0020 (rev 04)
        Subsystem: Unknown device 10b4:273d
        Flags: bus master, 66Mhz, medium devsel, latency 64, IRQ 11
        Memory at e4000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable)
        Memory at e6000000 (32-bit, prefetchable)
	Jeremy Fitzhardinge <jeremy@goop.org> informed me that I should ignore
the 0xe4000000 range since its marked un-prefetchable and is likely IO
registers.  
	Before all this wealth of information I was using something like:
# echo "base=0xe6000000 size=0x1000000 type=write-combining" >! /proc/mtrr
# echo "base=0xe4000000 size=0x1000000 type=write-combining" >! /proc/mtrr
	and this messed my video.  So I added:
# echo "base=0xe4000000 size=0x1000000 type=uncacheable" >! /proc/mtrr
	This seemed to fix the problem and everything seemed to work ok, but
I'm pretty sure this is just plain wrong, especially since the card only has 16
megs, not 32 and looking at the /proc/<pid>/maps the e4000000 range seems to be
broken up.  Then I got e-mail from you and Jeremy and I switched my settings to
your suggestion as per the vesa fb results:
# echo "base=0xe6000000 size=0x1000000 type=write-combining" >! /proc/mtrr
# echo "base=0xe6ff0000 size=0x10000 type=uncachable" >! /proc/mtrr
	This also seems to work ok.  I'm still confused as to the "right"
setting for these and mostly for what the card is actually using as the frame
buffer.  It seems to map a lot of address spaces all over the place. And I'm no
longer certain if its using one large frame buffer, or a chopped up one as Alan
Cox suggested it might in a prior e-mail to me.   The e6000000 seems to be
contiguous so I'm assuming thats the actual frame buffer.  Beats me what the
other address is for then. I guess I'm getting in over my head now. ;)
