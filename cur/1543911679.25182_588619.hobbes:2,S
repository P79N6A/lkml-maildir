Subject: [PATCH] Fix boot-time hang on G31/G33 PC
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch, loosely based on a patch from Robert Hancock, which was in
turn based on a patch from Jesse Barnes, fixes a boot-time hang on my
shiny new PC.  The 'conflict' mentioned in the patch in my case happens
to be between mmconfig and the graphics card, but it could easily be
between any pair of devices if they are left enabled by the BIOS and
mappen in the wrong place.
