It is not necessarily a good thing that everybody and her grandmother think
they can hack on Linux... exhibit A for the defense: Look at the average
skill level of your run-of-the-mill $GUI_WORDPROCESSOR user: Sure, they are
able to write a memo, and are "experts"; but make that a 20-page document,
and then use a different printer: Awful. This is exactly what Linus meant
when he said he doesn't want an in-kernel debugger: Dumb it down, and you
select dumber hackers, and the result is a mess.

Right. And C++ was designed carefully along "you pay for what you use", so
with careful programming it should be no worse. OTOH, in C you _see_ the
costs [OK, maybe a hardened asm-fanatic will take issue with that...], in
C++ you don't necessarily see what is going on. But that is part of
learning C++ well, I guess.

Right.

When Linux started, there was _no_ decent freeware C++ compiler around.
g++'s C++ was a bad joke, the compiler was very unstable, and C++ (the
language) changed almost weekly. Only recently (with egcs, essentially) did
the C++ support in GCC become respectable, and the language stabilized. But
by that time the kernel source corpus was firmly locked into (GCC's) C for
better or worse.
