ksoftirqd can run quite heavily sometime (it's needed for an efficient
NAPI for example) and it's not a general purpose kernel thread, and
all its work never blocks.

The true fact is that keventd is _not_ SCHED_FIFO in 2.[245] and in turn
it _cannot_ be used for real time things.
So if keventd is currently used for real-time things, those real-time
things are malfunctioning right now, no matter of the dirty inode/quota
flushing.
furthmore the only point of keventd compared to a tasklet is that
keventd queued-tasks can _sleep_, and so all the users of keventd should
be used to block (if they cannot block they should use a taslket instead
that has a chance to be faster, per-cpu cache locality etc...).

Probably yes, however it would be nice to be able to push inode buffers
to disk while the buffers are getting flushed. So queueing the work to
keventd (or adding a kinoded) still sounds better to me :).
