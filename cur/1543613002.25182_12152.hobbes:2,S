    Its easier to make sure its correct when we have a single structure not
    a pile of arrays.
I don't understand your reference to arrays. Nobody uses arrays.
That is something of the past.
    Object lifetime becomes explicit, and we don't have to
    worry about re-use races since a new instance of that major,minor
    will have a different object attached to the one in use that is
    about to be refcounted into oblivion by currently active requests
As described, my setup certainly has no re-use races, since
I do not use refcounts as a way to terminate the lifespan of
a kdev_t. So, are you saying that you prefer my version?
I have problems reading your replies.
