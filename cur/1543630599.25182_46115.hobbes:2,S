Indeed it seems like it works on most computers here atleast, and I would
like to explore this way of doing it before boiling out of it just to find
new
problems arising with other ways.
So, I now have a new problem I hope someone can help me out with.
It now mounts the cdrom as root like it should, but then gives me the error:
"Warning: unable to open an initial console."
I have checked everything I can think of, but if someone could point me to
exactly generates this error, I would be forever grateful.
