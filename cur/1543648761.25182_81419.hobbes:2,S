No, the concept of edge triggered APIs is that you have to use the fd
until EAGAIN. It's a very simple concept. That means that after a
connect()/accept() you have to start using the fd because I/O space might
be available for read()/write(). Dropping an event is an attempt of using
the API like poll() & Co., where after an fd born, it is put inside the
set to be later wake up. You're basically saying "the kernel should drop an
event at creation time" and I'm saying that, to keep the API usage
consistent to "use the fd until EAGAIN", you have to use the fd as soon as
it'll become available.

I'm sorry but why do you want to sell your mistakes for API flaws ?
