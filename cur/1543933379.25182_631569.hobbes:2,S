Please disregard the patch anyway - my test system was still using the custom 
DSDT - it doesn't fix anything.
Regardless, Linus' patch in question (in combination with Rafael's suspend 
reordering work) still broke suspend, and the port 0x142E write is still the 
offender, so something is still not playing nice - I'm just now at a complete 
loss as to what.
(PNPACPI came to mind as a suspect, but even with that disabled, this board/ 
chipset still wedges on suspend).
