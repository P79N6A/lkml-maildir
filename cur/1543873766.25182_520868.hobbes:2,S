Subject: decrease L2 cache size used by Linux?

Am benchmarking dumb matrix multiplication in trying to perceive
performance drop in case when matrix cannot fit in L2 cache.  However,
on my machine L2 cache is large - 2MB, so 512x512 matrix of double
numbers is needed to fill the cache, and in that case multiplication
is taking rather long time.  So I'm wondering is there a way to
control (decrease) L2 cache size used by Linux?  Apologies if question
inappropriate for the list.
Thanks.
