The firewall is also doing IP Masquerading/transparent proxying/port 
forwarding as part of a VPN setup (both source and destination NAT).  So 
iptables' connection tracking might be timing out, and/or interfering with 
the keepalive packets.  (Maybe the keepalive packets aren't making it through 
NAT?  That's my current theory.  I know that's got a timeout after which it 
forgets a masqueraded connection, and the same probably applies to the other 
forms of NAT.  My current theory is that keepalive packets aren't keeping NAT 
connections alive...)
