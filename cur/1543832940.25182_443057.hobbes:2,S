I did a little measuring. On average stop_machine_run() adds 8.7 msec of
overhead on a 4-way config. Of that %57 was sub-msec overhead. For the times
where overhead was measurable, the average was 20.2 msec, lowest at 10msec
highest at 100msec. That's on a z800 under vm and I have no idea how many real
cpus the machine has :-)
