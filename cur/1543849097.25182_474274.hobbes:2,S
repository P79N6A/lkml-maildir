No. A BUG() will terminate the current process which, aside from the
loss of userspace data, can tangle up the kernel badly and deadlock
or panic it.
If a bug can be fixed up or otherwise will not result in unstable
behaviour with continued operation, then it should be a WARN.

Definitely a bug. If the condition is not a bug then the code calling
WARN is, so it is a bug no matter how you look at it ;)
