Hi,
I'm currently toying with ptrace interface on my 2.2.9 / i386 kernel
I do have issues with the debug registers. 
what I'd like to be able to do, is, in the superior process, after
a wait returning a stop for a TRAP on the attached process, to read
DR6 with ptrace(PEEK_USER,...) to know which DR[0..3] has triggered
the trap (if any)
all my attemps always result in DR6 being 0
after looking at the code (but I may be plain wrong), it seems
that DR6 (debugreg[6]) is never updated
would something like this (on arch/i386/kernel/traps.c) do ?
