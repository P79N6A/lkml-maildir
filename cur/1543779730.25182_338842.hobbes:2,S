Also, my understanding was that when we properly support usb suspend,
this won't be an issue anyway for much usb hardware.  I think it's
possible to put some mice to sleep when there isn't any motion and
then wakeup later.
4.4% savings may not be much, but these things do add up.  For a
laptop's workload, I think this is worth it.
