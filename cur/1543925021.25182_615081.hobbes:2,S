Absolutely true - but completely missing the point.
When I open a UTF-8 file name as displayed by nautilus the kernel does
byte comparisons. The kernel doesn't care what character set is in use.

If your regexps are reasonably complete you just have to turn the unicode
match into a byte match. That is a user interface problem - in user space.
