I have verified that the versioning of the do_softirq symbol above is
the source of the problems in 2.4.6-pre2: I made two copies of the
local_bh_enable macro, one with the versioning hash explicitly
appended to the symbol, and chose between with #ifdef MODULE.
Everything works fine now.
Of course, this is ugly, ugly, ugly, so hopefully someone will answer
Ed's question as to the correct way of doing this.
Cheers, Wayne
