See my other message where I explain why a separate FS for /tmp makes
sense. It's got nothing to do with hard links and quotas.

No, you misunderstand what I meant. Again, you've snipped relevant
context. Maybe this is because you don't actually read all of what
people are saying to you? Slow down and read every word. You may think
you're saving time, but you end up taking 5 times longer because
people have to repeat what they say a few times before it finally
penetrates.
I meant that you should know better than to propose a change that
conveys no real benefit (Al and I have explained, several times(!)
why) and that would adversely impact other users. You're proposing
something for your (perceived) convenience, at the expense of others.
You should know better that that's selfish. It's not a nice thing to
do.
If you ever do/propose something that can adversely affect others,
think *very hard* if you really need to do what you want to do.
