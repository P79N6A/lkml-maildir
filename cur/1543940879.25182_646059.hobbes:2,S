We've had about 3 of these in Debian since deciding to cut it from the
upcoming release.  (The kicker for us was the samba security update that
wasn't tested with smbfs as a client.)  The key regressions of interest
relative to smbfs seem to be:
- lack of DFS support
- lack of netbios name resolution for UNC share names
The former seems to be a kernel issue whose resolution is in progress, and I
think the latter would have to be addressed in the userspace mount tools?
