NT is bad... but
while we spend time rewritting the whole kernel due to patches,
M$ distributes drivers :-(.

1. How % of perfomance will be lost if Pentium-5 task switch will get 3
tacts?
2. How % of perfomance do you ready to pay for additional reliability.
Note: I know that Pentium-5 does not exists :-).
I speak about extensibility, which can help us in the future.

Cool. So why do we still distribute patches?
P.S. As I see, my idea of new driver system is not very popular.
     Well, may be I'm wrong.
     But I hope you'll change you opinion in the future.
