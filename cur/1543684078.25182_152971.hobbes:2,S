Greetings,
While trying to duplicate Randy Hron's "dbench has intermittent hang on 
2.6.0-test1-ac2" report, I received quite a few "Buffer I/O error on 
/dev/hda8, logical block N" messages.  (changing elevators makes no 
difference fwiw).  I went back to test1, and it spat up a couple of "buffer 
layer error" messages and associated traces.   Attempting to umount 
afterward to run fsck left umount in D state.  See attachment.
Rebooting and running fsck turned up nothing wrong.
