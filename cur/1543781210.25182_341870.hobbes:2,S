Subject: 2.6.13-rcX really this bad ?

I've posted a couple of times than my newsserver is not stable
with any 2.6.13-rcX kernels.
Last kernel that survived is 2.6.12-mm1 (18+days)
Of course i can just stick with that kernel, but i thought it would
be wise to live on the edge and run a reasonable loaded server with
the latest/greatest. This ends in disaster though...
These are last uptimes, all reset by panic on reset.

Since i got no feedback on my previous posts, i either bring it 
the wrong way, or people don't care and i ought to shut up.
I think however that just before releasing a new stable kernel these
kind of feedback could be healthy to ironout some bugs.
For now i'll switch back to 2.6.12-mm1 and follow this mailling list
and try again when i the problems seem to have been solved.
