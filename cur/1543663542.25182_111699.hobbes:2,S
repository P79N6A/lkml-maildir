Or, since you mention a macro, maybe your question is not about
the usefulness of acpi_resource_to_address64() itself, but about
how I implemented it, namely, with the copy_field and copy_address
macros:
+#define copy_field(out, in, field)     out->field = in->field
+#define copy_address(out, in)                                  \
+       copy_field(out, in, resource_type);                     \
+       copy_field(out, in, producer_consumer);                 \
...
If you'd rather see it implemented without the macros, I have no
objection to that.  I just used the macros to reduce the chance of
making typographical errors along the way.  Attached is the
equivalent patch (untested) without the macros.  I also added a
note to the struct acpi_resource_addressXX definitions about the
need to make corresponding changes to acpi_resource_to_address64()
if the structures change.
