And I really think that (at least Pavel's version of) libc.so.5 is making 
some strange assumptions about memory layout of the process, which could 
also explain the other failures.
Pavel, could you please link the source code below against libc.so.5 with 
brk randomization turned on, and show the output, and if it segfaults, 
send the backtrace at the time of the crash? I suspect that it will crash 
somewhere in exit path when calling .dtor functions, as it will try to 
perform some cleanup in unmapped area. Thanks.
#include <unistd.h>

int main()
{
        int *curr_brk = sbrk(0);
        char command[1024];
        sprintf(command, "/bin/cat /proc/%d/maps", getpid());
        printf("brk set to %p\n", curr_brk);
        system(command);
        brk(curr_brk + 0x00001000);
        curr_brk = sbrk(0);
        printf("brk set to %p\n", curr_brk);
        system(command);
        exit(0);
}
