Well, this is for work_structs that are static (not dynamically
allocated.) struct lock_class_key is just a single byte because its
whole purpose is to be a unique pointer, there's nothing actually in it.
Hence, taking the address of the work struct (when it's statically
allocated) is a unique pointer just as well.
