It would be nice to have a solution that taps after its been sent to the
driver. I clearly need to investigate the tc problems, but I've been using a
similar patch now for a few weeks to allow more accurate timestamps to be
performed in the driver without cloning problems getting in the way. (the tap
skb only gets cloned after the driver has time stamped it). This is more 
accuracy than most need but is required for the clock synchronisation i'm
working on. It also seems less intrusive to let the driver have the skb first
before pushing it to the taps.
