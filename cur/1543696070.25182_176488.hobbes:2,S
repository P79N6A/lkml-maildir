Not happening since 2.6.0-test9. Don't know what really fixed it, but
they're just not there anymore.

Most probably caused by the same thing that prevented it loading under
amd_k7_agp, that is indeed sorted out.

Could you have some AMD_76X -define left over? I skimmed through MP &
MPX AMD documents, but found nothing incriminating.
Could it be ACPI doing it's things with S -states? (it does check for
SMP, but does report S -states as supported). And if ACPI isn't
enabled, could you toggle it on, or vice-versa.
