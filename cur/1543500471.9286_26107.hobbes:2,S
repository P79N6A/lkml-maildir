For now, every app with this problem has to implement something like
a growable (and hopefully shrinkable) filesystem within a file.
Apps can add a block mapping layer complete with triple-indirect
blocks, or they can copy around huge amounts of data and update
document references as needed.

I greatly dislike playing with libc. There once was a libc that
would do compression, but it is dead now.
Static executables are a problem.
Every stat() call that acts on a directory must cause guessing,
perhaps by doing many more system calls inside the directory.
I doubt this would help with web benchmarks -- it will be disabled.
Without kernel support, the library would have to guess which directories
need special treatment. This is a bug unless you can explain how various
standards let directories suddenly and accidentally turn into files.
At the very least this is ugly behavior.
I hate to see libc full of heavy wrappers. Many filesystem functions
would have to do several additional system calls. Eew.

Note that we do have an NTFS driver. This driver is clearly missing
support for reparse points. Do you have a solution for that?
