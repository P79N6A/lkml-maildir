Just for some context, I have...
- 1,400-odd open bugzilla reports
- 719 emails saved away in my emailed-bug-reports folder, all of which
  need to be gone through, asking originators to retest and
  re-report-if-unfixed.
- A big ugly email titled "2.6.24-rc5-git1: Reported regressions from
  2.6.23" in my inbox.
All of which makes it a bit inappropriate to be thinking about
intrusive-looking new features.
Ho hum.  Just send me the whole lot against rc5-mm1 and I'll stick it in
there and we'll see what breaks.
