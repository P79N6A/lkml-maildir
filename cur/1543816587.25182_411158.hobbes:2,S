Er, no, it won't, because (now-bclock) won't be large.
I know thinking about math on a modulo number line such as u8/16/32 is
odd, but it's best if you just always think of "subtraction" to mean
"distance between." (Which is always true in any space or coordinate
system, even with wrap arounds.) This is the same trick used by
Andrew's ring buffers, where you let head and tail wrap around freely,
and only perform the modulo operation at dereferencing.
A simple test program will give you a better feel for what's going on
(I write a lot of these...):
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  unsigned int a,b,c;
  a=-1-1;
  b=1000;
  c=b-a;
  printf("%u - %u = %u\n", b, a, c);
}
ray@issola:~/work/test/overflow$ gcc -o test test.c
ray@issola:~/work/test/overflow$ ./test
1000 - 4294967294 = 1002
So, it wraps appropriately, as odd as that may seem at first blush.
