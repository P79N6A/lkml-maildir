Well I've just seen an FC box (6? 7?) running a 2.6.18-ish which  
reliably experiences the same problem (randomly stuck keys), so I  
doubt very much it's CFS.  Basically keys will somewhat randomly  
repeat 6-7 times, mainly depending on how fast you're typing (the  
intern using the box typed somewhat slowly and didn't trigger it  
much, but when I borrowed his keyboard I could reliably trigger it  
once every 5 sec or so.  Unfortunately I don't have access to that  
box anymore, so I can't really debug the problem.
