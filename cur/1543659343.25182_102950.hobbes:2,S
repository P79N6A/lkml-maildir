Goto's aside, I find the above extremely bad advise. You should _always_
develop with smp and for smp from the very start, or you will most
likely not get it right later on. With preempt, this becomes even more
important.

Taking a spin lock twice will hard lock the machine, however on smp you
will typically have the luxury of an nmi watchdog which will help you
solve this quickly. Double unlock will oops immediately if you run with
spin lock debugging (you probably should, if you are developing kernel
code).
