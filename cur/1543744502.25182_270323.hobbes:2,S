It currently does this for vfork, but not clone.  Basically, you can't
call into glibc at all if you use clone.  If you aren't using POSIX
threads, then the POSIX-compliant library is going to fall to pieces
around you.  For instance, all the file locking will break, and
anything else that, like the PID cache, relies on either global or
per-_thread_ data.
