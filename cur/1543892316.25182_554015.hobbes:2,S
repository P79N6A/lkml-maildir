Hi all,
I've just released Linux 2.4.35-pre5.
It contains two important fixes. One is a fix for a regression I
introduced when trying to fix CVE-2007-1353 (bluetooth), which
fortunately was noticed by Marcel Holtmann. Basically, I turned
a memory leak bug into a memory corruption bug :-(
The other fix is for a bug which was causing oopses when loading ide-disk
as a module. This problem was reported by Zbigniew Baniewski but its cause
was not obvious at all even after long debugging sessions. Finally, PaX
Team noticed that init_idle() is marked __init while (indirectly) called
by restinit() explicitly stating that it must not call __init functions.
Once the problem identified and explained, the obvious patch definitely
fixed the problem.
One of the remaining patches includes the fixes that LVM users
systematically have to apply to mainline kernels (except one which is
wrong). Other fixes are minor.
I will open -rc1 soon with the very few last pending updates, and I hope
to be able to release an unquestionably perfect 2.4.35 around the end
of this month :-)
So please, if you encounter any problems, it's the moment to complain
loudly. Please not that I have not recompiled this one since LVM changes. 
Regards,
Willy
