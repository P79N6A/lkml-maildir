Hi,
a.  Is there an owner/maintainer of pc_keyb.c?  I have
searched the MAINTAINERS file with no luck.
b.  For systems with USB keyboards (and 8042 controller
but no 8042/serial keyboard),
pc_keyb.c prints erroneous/misleading messages
such as "Too many NACKs -- noisy kbd cable?" under the
control of #ifdef KBD_REPORT_TIMEOUTS.  Would it be OK
to make KBD_REPORT_TIMEOUTS a CONFIG option so that
these messages could be disabled?
Here are some other possibilities to consider.
c.  Possibly set a global variable if both
the USBcore and the USB keyboard driver are loaded and the
USB keyboard driver has found a keyboard (e.g., set usb_kbd
to 1).  Then in pc_keyb.c, use if (!usb_kbd) to prevent
the reporting of these timeouts.  Of course, if a system
has both an "8042 keyboard" and a USB keyboard, and the
8042 keyboard is having real errors, this would prevent
the error messages from being printed.
d.  Simply add "or USB kbd" to the message(s).
e.  Is there is a reliable way to detect the condition of
no 8042-attached keyboard?  That's what is really needed IMO,
but it's elusive.
f.  MSFT has proposed a change to ACPI (in the Fixed ACPI Tables;
ACPI doesn't have to be enabled) so that the boot portion of an
OS can be told if there is an 8042 controller present.  If this
is accepted into ACPI, this will be a usable long-term solution,
but doesn't help in the short term.  (See
http://www.teleport.com/~acpi/,
 last link on the page, or
http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/onnow/download/LFreeACPI.doc,
boot arch. flags.)
g.  Other near-term suggestions?
Thanks,
Randy
