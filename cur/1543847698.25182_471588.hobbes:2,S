Also, we need to make hot-key events  have similar handling code .
For example, Fn+F5 and Fn+F6 are brightness down and up key on my sony laptop.  
There is a driver called sonypi.c can map Fn+F5/F6 to KEY_FN_F5/F6. But I 
think It should be mapped to KEY_BRIGHTNESSDOWN/UP (linux/input.h)
Although, sonypi.c is NOT so clean, but , if it can report right event to 
input layer for all sony laptop(it works for me), and all related functions 
can be controlled through generic sysfs interface, then I would say sony has 
the best hot-key solution I have even seen so far for linux.
Thanks,
Luming.
