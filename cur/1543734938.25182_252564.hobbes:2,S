linld is a Linux boot loader for DOS,
similar to loadlin.
It was written because I failed to find out why
loadlin cannot load new, larger kernel images.
I stuck to using C and ended up with fairly small
code, partially because linld have no support for
ancient kernels.
New version addresses the following issue:
kernel (at least 2.6 one) does not believe in incomplete
last RAM page, so if boot loader places initrd image
sot that it's tail end up in that last page,
kernel thinks that initrd is truncated and drops it.
I bas bitten by this when I tried booting on a machine
which had only 3 kb out of 4 in it's last RAM page
(1 kb reserved for BIOS or something like that).
