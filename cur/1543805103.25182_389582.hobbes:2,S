Yes, sounds sane, to double the sizes of BUFFER_SIZE and NUM_ENVP in
lib/kobject_uevent.c. I'll do the same for udev now.

Sure, that's fine to change. Nobody besides modprobe should be interested in
the content of the string. We just pass it back to modprobe which matches
against the depmod generated list in /lib/modules/<2.6.16...>/modules.alias
to find the modules to load. If you make sure that modprobe $MODALIAS still
loads the right modules, everything should be fine.
Both changes sounds good to me, please do.
Thanks,
Kay
