UMSDOS as-is, no not really, but I would like to see it ported to run
on top of smb. Being able to have an smb equivalent to nfsroot would
be really cool for disk space limited laptops and the like where you
want to run e.g. colinux. All you'd need is a vmlinuz file, a small
initrd file, and you're set to go. No need for
filesystems-on-big-files and such workarounds...
How much work would this take? I had a glance at the UMSDOS code and
it _seems_ rather light, but it's unchartered territory for me...
