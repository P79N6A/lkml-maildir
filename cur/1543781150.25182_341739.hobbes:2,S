Normal code                   NMI
fetch preempt_count
add                   <-----  interrupt here add and store then subtract 
and store, darn!
store preempt_count
Ok, no problem.
The problem is in the RT code when PREEMPT_DEBUG is on.  The tests for 
reasonable counts fail because of the rather undefined state when NMI 
picks up the word.  The failure is on the NMI side...
