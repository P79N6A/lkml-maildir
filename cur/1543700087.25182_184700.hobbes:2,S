| Well, that's a _really_ "ideal" world. Ideal to the point of being

Don't forget time in o/s queues, once an array get loaded that may
dominate the mechanical latency and transfer times. If you call "access
time" the sum of all latency between syscall and the first data
transfer, then reading from multiple drives doesn't reliably help until
you get the transfer time from an i/o somewhere between 2 and 4x the
access time. So if the transfer time for a typical i/o is less than 2x
the typical access time, gains are unlikely. If you set the stripe size
high enough to make it likely that a typical i/o falls on a single drive
you usually win. And when the transfer time reaches 4x the access time,
you almost always win with a split.
So if you are copying 100MB elements you probably win by spreading the
i/o, but for more normal things it doesn't much matter.
THERE'S ONE EXCEPTION: if you have a f/s type which puts the inodes at
the beginning of the space, and you are creating and deleting a LOT of
files, with a large stripe you will beat the snot out of one drive and
the system will bottleneck no end. In that one case you gain by using
small stripe size and spreading the head motion, even though the file
i/o itself may really rot. Makes me wish for a f/s which could put the
inodes in some distributed pattern.

|

Yeah, yeah, what you said... all true.
| 
| Big stripes help because:
| 
|  - disks already do big transfers well, so you shouldn't split them up.
|    Quite frankly, the kinds of access patterns that let you stream
|    multiple streams of 50MB/s and get N-way throughput increases just
|    don't exists in the real world outside of some very special niches (DoD
|    satellite data backup, or whatever).
| 
|  - it makes it more likely that the disks in the array really have
|    _independent_ IO patterns, ie if you access multiple files the disks
|    may not seek around together, but instead one disk accesses one file.
|    At this point RAID0 starts to potentially help _latency_, simply
|    because by now it may help avoid physical seeking rather than just try
|    to make throughput go up.
| 
| I may be wrong, of course. But I doubt it.
Not that I can see, but I'm not sure that you had thought that the
inodes and the data may have very different usage patterns.
About six years ago most usenet software used one file per article to
hold data. Creating and deleting 10-20 files/sec put a severe load on
the directory and journal drives. Eventually (with AIX and JFS) I put
the journal file on a solid state drive to get performance up.
