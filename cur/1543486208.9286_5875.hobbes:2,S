Are you talking about
        /* N.B. We shouldn't need this ... dentry layer handles it */
        err = nfserr_perm;
        if (!flen || (fname[0] == '.' &&
            (flen == 1 || (flen == 2 && fname[1] == '.'))) ||
            !tlen || (tname[0] == '.' &&
            (tlen == 1 || (tlen == 2 && tname[1] == '.'))))
                goto out;
	...
        /* N.B. We shouldn't need this test ... handled by dentry layer */
        err = nfserr_acces;
        if (!flen || isdotent(fname, flen))
                goto out;
then yes, there is lots of historical stuff in there. knfsd was originally
written for older kernels. But note the comments.
That's kind of my argument: we _used_ to need to have "." and ".." and for
filesystems that didn't have them (like the iso9660 CD-ROM filesystem) we
went to a fair amount of trouble to try to handle them correctly (and
there were still special cases where we didn't, as far as I can tell).
With the dentries, that just went away, but we still have cruft there.
