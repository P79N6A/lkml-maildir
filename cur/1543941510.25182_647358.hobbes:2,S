Back then I added some debug code to tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick to get
some more information when this happens again.  As this happened just
now I saw:
	- tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick was called from irq_exit
	  Actually this didn't surprise me, because
	  tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick is only called at two places, namely
	  irq_exit and cpu_idle.  And I cannot see how
	  local_softirq_pending() != 0 can happen in the latter (without
	  first happening in irq_exit maybe).
	- it happened three times in a row at the following times:
		[ 1593.470000] NOHZ: (c003a3ac) local_softirq_pending 20
		[ 1593.470000] Tasklet state=1, func=c0046248, data=0
		[ 1593.920000] NOHZ: (c003a3ac) local_softirq_pending 20
		[ 1593.920000] Tasklet state=1, func=c0046248, data=0
		[ 1594.980000] NOHZ: (c003a3ac) local_softirq_pending 20
		[ 1594.980000] Tasklet state=1, func=c0046248, data=0
	  (c003a3ac = irq_exit+0x24/0x94)
	- There was a single tasklet in __get_cpu_var(tasklet_vec).list:
	  	state = 1
		func = rcu_process_callbacks (= c0046248)
		data = 0
	- directly afterwards the oom-killer started killing tasks
I think the only user of rcu in my kernel is networking code.  Does this
help anyone to further debug my problem here?
Best regards
Uwe
