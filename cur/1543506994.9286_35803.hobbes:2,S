Hi
This one has had me stumped for a while.
On my local LAN, there are several machines, some Linux, some Windows.
I have a DLink net card (DE-530 I think) in my box  which the tulip
driver (0.89H) idetifies as a DC21041. Most of the other machines are
using 3COM Etherlink 2 cards (all dated 1991!) and the 3COM 3c503
kernel driver. There is one machine on the network that is using a
Realtek (8019 afair) using the ne2k-pci driver from RH6 2.2.5-15
kernel.
Speeds from my card to any of the 3COM cards (or anywhere else in the
world) are just fine, as are speeds from the 3COM cards to any others
locally, or elsewhere. The Realtek will work just fine with any card
on the network or in the world, except my DLink.
I have tested the RealTek card in different machines, with different
kernels, on different networks. Even with the Realtek machine behind a
3COM machine using IP-masq, we never get above 10KB/sec between my
DLink and the RealTek. I have replaced hubs, cables, everything. No
matter what factors I change, it always comes down to these two cards
simply not liking each other.
I would have just put it down to "driver oddity" were it not for the
fact that it still displayed the strange behaviour behind IP-Masq'ing.
This just doesn't make any sense to me.
Has anyone got any ideas or suggestions for what I can try to debug
it?
For now, the RealTek is gathering dust in a cupboard and has been
replaced with a 8029 RealTek that does work, but I want to get the
problem solved, it's bothering me!
