Subject: New rtl8139 driver prevents ssh from exiting.

The kernel thread the new rtl8139 driver spawns
apparently wants to write to stdout, because it counts
as an unfinished process that prevents an ssh session
from exiting.
I have a script that remotely reconfigures subnets in
a vpn, which gets run via an ssh in through eth0 and
does, among other things:
ifconfig eth1 down
ifconfig eth1 up
Hence kicking off the thread.  I have to run "killall
eth1" at the end of the script to make ssh exit. 
(This doesn't seem to have any negative impact on
eth1's functioning.)
Anybody feel like shedding light on this?
Rob
