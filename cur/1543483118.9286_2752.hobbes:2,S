Subject: SCSI emulation broken in 2.2.1?

I'm having a weird time with scsi emulation in my brand-spanking-new
2.2.1 kernel. When I load the ide-scsi module, I get:
--snip--
scsi0 : SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices
scsi : 1 host.
  Vendor: HP        Model: CD-Writer+ 7100   Rev: 3.01
  Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
scsi0 channel 0 : resetting for second half of retries.
SCSI bus is being reset for host 0 channel 0.
scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid 2, scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 1 Request Sense 20 00 00 10 00
--snip--
and lsmod shows:
--snip--
Module                  Size  Used by
ide-scsi                6608   1  (uninitialized)
--snip--
Things worked just great with the 2.2.0-preX kernels, does anyone
know what's wrong here?
