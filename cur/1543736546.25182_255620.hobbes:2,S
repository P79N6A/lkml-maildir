OK.
BTW, I was able to find a bug thanks to your comment :-)
The following 'spin_lock(&iosapic_lock)' was missing. I'll update
the patch.
	if (unlikely(idesc->action)) {
		iosapic_intr_info[vector].refcnt++;
MISSING =>	spin_unlock(&iosapic_lock);
		spin_unlock_irqrestore(&idesc->lock, flags);
		printk(KERN_WARNING "Cannot unregister GSI. IRQ %u is still in use.\n", irq);
		return;
	}
Thanks,
