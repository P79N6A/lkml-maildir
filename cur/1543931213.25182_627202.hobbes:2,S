But there are some things that get set up long before
udelay() is calibrated! The interrupt controllers,
the timer, etc. You can't just substitute or you
will end up with machines that won't boot!
grep /usr/src/linux-`uname -r`/arch/i386/kernel/*.c
for lots of outb_p()'s!
That's why the manufacturing port, 0x80, really
needs to be used for I/O timing! If it kills that
one machine, then that one machine is broken and
needs to be fixed. It's probably an undetected
error in a FPGA that once reported will get fixed.
In fact, it might just be one motherboard and
if that motherboard was replaced, the problem
goes away. We have been there before. We can't
"fix" stuff that's not broken without running
the risk of breaking a lot more stuff.
