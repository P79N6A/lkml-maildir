I get the same problem with my Abit-BP6, but possibly due to other reasons
(like having a USB keyboard).
In the BIOS setup, ensure that the option 'USB Keyboard support' is set
either to 'Disabled' or 'OS'. It's doubtful it's this anyway, but give it a
try.
Also, the signal voltage for PS/2 and DIN keyboards may differ. Try getting
hold of a 'pure' PS/2 keyboard and trying that.
