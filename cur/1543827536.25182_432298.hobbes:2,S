i dont know - i feel uneasy about the 'any pointer' method - it has a 
high potential for false negatives, especially for structures that 
contain strings (or other random data), etc.
did you consider the tracking of the types of allocated blocks 
explicitly? I'd expect that most blocks dont have pointers embedded in 
them that point to allocated blocks. For the ones that do, the 
allocation could be extended with the type information. For each 
affected type, we could annotate the structures themselves with offset 
information. How intrusive would such a method be?
