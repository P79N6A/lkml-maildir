Okay, I got the problem to occur again with 2.6.18.  I will attach my
config in case you wish to scrutinize for any boneheadedness on my
part.
I provoked the problem both with and without the additional read of
IntMaskSet.  Amazingly, I lost host1 on the bus reset that occured
after this sequence:
rmmod ohci1394
rmmod ieee1394
make
make modules_install
modprobe ohci1394
which followed my adding the extra register read line.  Here's the
entirety of the host1 stuff (I did a s/.*host[^1].*//g in vim).  I
snipped some of the self ID chatter.

I don't know if the host loss when I didn't have the additional read
is meaningful, but there it is simply:
Nov 27 13:04:39 spanky kernel: ohci1394: fw-host2: SelfID packet
0x823fc4f8 rf8c43f8c

Nov 27 13:06:30 spanky kernel: ohci1394: fw-host2: Soft reset finished

Oh, poop.  I didn't mention that I have:
options ieee1394 disable_nodemgr=1
options ohci1394 phys_dma=0
in my /etc/modprobe.conf.  The Linux adapters are functioning as
simulated peripherals to a piece of control hardware that always has a
dest address of 0x0000 0000 0000 on all packets so I needed to get rid
of posted writes and any bickering over bus master.
