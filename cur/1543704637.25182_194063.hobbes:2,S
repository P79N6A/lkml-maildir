Hi, Martin:
In a recent changeset in Linus' tree, there's your diff which blows up
the dasd naming scheme, with the comment:
 - Change dasd names from "dasdx" to "dasd_<busid>_".
This breaks mkinitrd, nash, and mount by label (not to mention every
zipl.conf out there, because root= aliases to /sys/block/%s).
Would you please explain what exactly you were thinking when you
submitted that patch?
