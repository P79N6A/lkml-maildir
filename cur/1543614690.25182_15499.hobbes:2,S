Subject: [PATCH] new aty128fb supported card?

I have a recent ATI 128 card (XPERT 2000 or something?).  In any case, lspci 
gives:
01:05.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Rage 128 Pro TF
or numerically:
01:05.0 Class 0300: 1002:5446
Now the aty128fb driver just ignores it gracefully.  Being no kernel hacker, 
it took me some time to discover the remedy, namely:

Any chance of getting it into the kernel?
