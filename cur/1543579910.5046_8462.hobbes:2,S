A few things come to mind:
1. Is your init statically linked or linked with shared libraries? If 
it's shared, do you have all the shared objects on your disk image in a 
place where they can be found (/lib, I hope)? You might try linking it 
statically (but stripped) just to make sure.
2. Is it in the path that the kernel is looking in? check init/main.c to 
see what your kernel is looking for (it's some educational reading anyway).
3. Even if 'init' isn't found, it should try to run /bin/sh as a last 
resort. I can't imagine you don't have one of those.
4. Is init executable?
5. "unable to open an initial console" probably means you don't have the 
necesary device nodes (refer to init/main.c)
6. If this doesn't help, there is a ramdisk FAQ that is well written...
Good luck with it!
