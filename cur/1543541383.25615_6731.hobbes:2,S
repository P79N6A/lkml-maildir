Hi,
 I have a strange problem with kernel 2.4.0-test6:
 On each boot, the command "swapon" in the bootscripts needs
 about *thirty minutes* to finish its works......
 Booting 2.4.0-test5 has /no/ problems with swapon.
 Versions:
 swapon: mount-2.10n
 (same goes for mkswap and swapoff, compiled all under 2.4.0-test5)
 IDE-based harddisc
 kernel as above, 
 gcc-2.95.2
 What's going on here?
 Any help very appreciated ! :-)
 Thank you vewry much in advance!
 Meino Cramer
