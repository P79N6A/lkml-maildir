Hi all,
I've installed 2.2.0-pre9 ( final for Linus ) in my Debian system and I get
some warnings and one error.
One warning is a modprobe about "net-pf-5" one that I turn around
uncommenting a line "alias net-pf-5 off"
in "/etc/conf.modules".
The second one is a "TIOCSER obsolete" coming from "/etc/rc.boot/0setserial"
and introduced
by the "-W" switch ( that I've deleted ).
The error condition is coming from the "/etc/init.d/network" where the
command
"route add -net 192.168.1.0" return me with a "SIOCADDRT: Invalid argument".
My network configuration is very simple:
ne2k-pci ethernet card
ipv4
Some suggestions for me ?
Regards, Davide.
