OK, will try that.  decimal of octal(0164) = decimal(116)

OK, allow me to explain:
When the modes come up on screen, they are numbered (0, 1, 2, ... a, b, etc.) 
  This is what the 'a' refers to.  Hey, it worked through LILO on 2.4 kernels.
Before I type in scan, the number for the 132x60 mode is actually 030C.  After 
I've typed in 'scan', then it comes up as 0164.  If I enter 0164 BEFORE I type 
in 'scan' at the vid mode, it still works.  But not if I give it as argument 
to GRUB.  As I said, will try giving decimal equivalent (116) as argument to GRUB.
