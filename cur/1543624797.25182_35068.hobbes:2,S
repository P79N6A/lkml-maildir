My bad.  There was a mistake in the patch (ie. I didn't actually do
this).
OTOH, shades of fcntl!  Syscalls are not "wasted": one for every
fundamental operation makes *sense*.  If I were doing it with timeouts
from scratch, I'd definitely have done two syscalls.  As it is, the
"op" arg gives us a chance for more overloading in future.
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
