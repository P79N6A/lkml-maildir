It's not a bug but intentional.  With the 68851 and 68030 builtin PMUs
you can only only distinguish between read and execute permission if
you either use an additional FCL lookup which adds an additional leve
to the page table tree or you use long descriptors which need twice as
much memory.  The later 68k series PMUs don't even support that
feature in hardware apparently because nobody used it.
(Beware - I stopped hacking Linux/68k for the sake of the MIPS port in
'93 so my memory is somewhat rusty ...)
It's also not a bug because it is consistent with all UNIX specifications.

You could play games combining segments and MMU features to achive that.
See Solar's no-exec stack patch.
