This is due to a lost APIC interrupt acknowledgement.  A workaround
is to boot with the `noapic' LILO option.
This long-standing and very nasty problem was discussed extensively
a week or two ago.  Suspicions were cast at the disable_irq() function
but I'm not sure anything 100% conclusive was arrived at.
I guess I'll have to find a way to make disable_irq() go away,
see if that helps.
