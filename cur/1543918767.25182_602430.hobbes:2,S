Hi
Ok, after a day of biseting, it turns out to be a compiler problem. The 
gcc-3.3.5 produces at least these two problems (Oops on i2c-viapro probe 
and disabled IRQs in USB), whereas 4.1.2 has no problem so far. Up to now 
3.3.5 had no problem compiling 2.6.20+ kernels here, for example, for P-II 
SMP. Does it at all look realistic that such "random" run-time problems 
are caused by a miscompilation?...
Thanks
Guennadi
