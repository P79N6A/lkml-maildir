I don't think so. On a single CPU system we need atomic updates
to protect modifying of critical variables from interrupts, and
ll/sc sequences guarantee exactly that. But on UP system we don't
need memory barriers of any kind (I mean system memory space accesses,
not IO, of course), as we don't care about read/write ordering at all.

For IO space access mb's are required, but ll/sc are of no use, AFAIK.
However, if I understand correctly, the r/w semaphores can't be used from
interrupt context, so in this case I'd agree -- this stuff could be made
completely non-atomic for UP.

If you mean some external modules, then ok. The modules built from the
main tree shouldn't have any problems...
