So far my testing has shown both the original and the new version of the 
S-bit patch work in that no corruption seemed to occur over long term 
runs.  The previous S-bit patch may have only worked due to something 
specific about how my PCI companion chip handles I/O to low memory 
addresses (from dereferencing a link address of 0).  Perhaps the e100 
handles the NULL link as well, but given that the manual does not seem 
to state what happens when the hardware encounters a buffer with a link 
of 0, I think Milton's fix is the proper way to do it.  The old eepro 
driver did set both bits although it did it with a hardcoded constant.
I will continue testing with slab debug on but that will take longer. 
Has anyone tried this on other platforms?
