Hi, Pierre.
max_phys_segments: the maximum number of segments in a request
		   *before* DMA mapping
max_hw_segments: the maximum number of segments in a request
		 *after* DMA mapping (ie. after IOMMU merging)
Those maximum numbers are for block layer.  Block layer must not exceed 
above limits when it passes a request downward.  As long as all entries 
in sg are processed, block layer doesn't care whether sg iteration is 
performed by the driver or hardware.
So, if you're gonna perform sg by iterating in the driver, what numbers 
to report for max_phys_segments and max_hw_segments is entirely upto how 
many entries the driver can handle.
Just report some nice number (64 or 128?) for both.  Don't forget that 
the number of sg entries can be decreased after DMA-mapping on machines 
with IOMMU.
IOW, the part which performs sg iteration gets to determine above 
limits.  In your case, the driver is reponsible for both iterations (pre 
and post DMA mapping), so all the limits are upto the driver.
Hope it helped.
