I've seen this junk for many years.  It's not limited to just 2.6.
In my current environment, it's the KVM screwing with the mouse data...
somehow it starts passing through 3 byte commands when the mouse is in
4 byte mode.  I fixed it by a little trickery to force the mouse to
reset (not a simple task from the ISR :-)  BTW, 250ms is WAY to long to
wait to detect a lose of sync; mice don't pause at all between bytes.)
