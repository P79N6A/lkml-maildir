Just thought I'd give a "me too" response.  The Red Hat 7.2 kernel powers 
down all three systems I've tried it on (a Dell Inspiron 3500 laptop, a 
Toshiba Tecra 8000, and an SIS chipset motherboard).  The 2.4.18 and 2.4.17 
kernels do NOT power down any of those systems (It will spins down the hard 
drive instead, but the system power stays on.  Yes, I'm compiling in the 
right APM support.  I've tried it both with and without the "use APM bios to 
power down" switch.)
The only difference between boots is the kernel.  Haven't had time to really 
look into it, but a quick check of the code didn't reveal any obviously 
cuplable differences between the apm power down functions under the arch 
directory.  It seems like something else in the system state is getting 
twiddled that turns a turn-the-machine-off request into a "reduce power but 
stay on" request that just spins down the hard drive...
Dunno.
