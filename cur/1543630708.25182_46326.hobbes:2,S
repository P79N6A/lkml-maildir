Hi Pozsar, this is a known supermount bug. I got this as well. Supermount is 
a patch for 2.4.18pre8 kernel, not for 2.4.19preX. See also
http://www.mandrake.com/en/archives/cooker/2002-04/msg00086.php
I will try my best to figure out what is happening. The open(".",...) call to 
supermount returns -1 and this gives "stale NFS handle", but 
open("/mnt/cdrom", ...) gives "3" or a positive number. I think the text of 
the message is misleading, it has nothing to do with NFS.
