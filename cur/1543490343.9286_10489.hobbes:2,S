Hello all!
I'm having some minor problems with a Linux/redhat system I administer.
It has an uptime of 309 days and it is based on an very old Redhat, 3.0.3
(Picasso), though some of the software on it has been updated for long
times.
It's running kernel 2.0.33, maybe a little ancient, but that is working
fine, as far as I can tell.
I received a mail today that several hosts in the network connected to this
system have been cracked, and when I looked at the system today, I saw some
weird things when doing a ps aux:
root     25716  0.0  2.7   920   412  ?  R  Jan 17   0:00 ps aux
This was the command I was running several seconds ago; the date of this
system is fine.
Does anyone have any ideas about the why of this problem?
VrGr,
