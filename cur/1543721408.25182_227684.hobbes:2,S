Just to put in my $.02.  We developed a very simple (even simpler than Kmonitor 
in that it didn't track fork/exec) way for a process to get notified when other 
processes exited (properly or otherwise).  We want to use this in the field for 
a lifecycle monitoring function (a sort of super-init) so it needs to be as 
lightweight as possible.  I'd love to be able to use something from the mainline 
kernel, but it has to be field-runnable without slowing stuff down.
