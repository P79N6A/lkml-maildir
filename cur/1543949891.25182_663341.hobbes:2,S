Hold off on this. It turns out it still has major problems. The menu algorithm now and then gets really bad at predicting sleep times, completely killing this avoidance scheme.
(On that subject, does anyone except Adam understand that algorithm? Some comments wouldn't hurt...)
So for now, I'm back to thinking that measuring the interval between deep sleeps is the better approach. I could use some ideas for a good clock source though. I haven't dug much deeper than jiffies when it comes to kernel timekeeping.
