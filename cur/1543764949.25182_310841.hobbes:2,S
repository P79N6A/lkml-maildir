Dear diary, on Tue, Apr 12, 2005 at 12:40:21AM CEST, I got a letter
where Pedro Larroy <piotr@larroy.com> told me that...

Hello,

(i) 1461501637330902918203684832716283019655932542976 possible SHA1 hashes.
(ii) In git-pasky, there's (turnable off) detection of collisions.
(iii) Your argument against comparing with the probability of a hardware
error does not make sense to me.
(iv) You fail to propose a better solution.

98% of the time I am right. Why worry about the other 3%.
