It is not just the relative priorities of the realtime tasks, but
also the scheduling policy.  SCHED_FIFO (and to some extent SCHED_RR)
implies an ordering within the runqueue for tasks of the same priority.
This is difficult to achieve with multiple runqueues.  Most scheduler
implementations I am aware of, do something like what you suggested
above.
