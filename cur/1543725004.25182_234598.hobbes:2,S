Subject: [ANNOUNCE] [PATCH] 2.6.8-rc1-kexec1  (ppc & x86)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I finally found some time to work on kexec again.
I have taken the time to break the patches apart again, because
with everything all in one patch things get unmaintainable.
But I have also lumped everything together in one big patch to make testing
easier.
While doing this I found a bug where I was not putting IOAPIC into
virtual wire mode where appropriate.  This allows kexec to work on Opterons
and other affected systems.
The files are available at:

The first hunk of patches are essentially generic fixes to the boot
process.  That should be safe to apply in general.
i8259-shutdown.patch
apic-shutdown.patch
reboot-on-bsp.patch
ioapic-virtwire.patch
x86 does not like tlb flush or other generic code against the init_mm
this allows those to proceed.  I think long term I want to get away from
using init_mm, to many architectures make weird assumptions.
flush-init-mm.patch
The next are the kexec patches themselves.  The generic code and then
the architecture specific code.
kexec-generic.patch
i386-kexec.patch
ppc-gc-kexec.patch
Have fun with it, and please report what breaks.
Eric
