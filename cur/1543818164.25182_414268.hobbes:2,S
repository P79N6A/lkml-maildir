Sorry I have been absent from the discussion for such a long time.
I'm trying to catch up on old issues that I should have reviewed earlier.
I like this change.  I think it's sensible to keep the invariant that
SIGNAL_STOP_DEQUEUED can't be set when SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT is set.
Good work, Oleg.
Thanks,
Roland
