i've uploaded the -P6 patch:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.8.1-P6
i'm releasing another patch today because the mystic 900 usec latency
seems to be nailed finally, with the help of Mark H Johnson's traces:
there were two places that set ->preempt_count back to 0 without the
tracer noticing it: preempt_schedule() and entry.S's return path.
other changes since -P5:
 - generic kernel fix: do not ignore idle=poll on non-P4 CPUs.
   (Mark H Johnson)
 - fix the __trace link bug reported by Martin Rumori. All combinations
   of CONFIG_PREEMPT_TIMING & CONFIG_LATENCY_TRACE should work now.
 - make kernel_preemption=1 the default. Most people use this anyway.
