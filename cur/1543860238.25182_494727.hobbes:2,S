I must admit that this sounds better than list_privatize_rcu().  But since
the source list gets initialized, so how about list_splice_init_rcu()?
Patch below, untested, probably does not compile.  This takes the sync
function as an argument, so one would do something like:
	INIT_LIST_HEAD(&list);
	list_splice_init_rcu(&intf->cmdrcvrs, &list, synchronize_rcu);
The idea being to keep the RCU API proliferation down to a dull roar.
Thoughts?
