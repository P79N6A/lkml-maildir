Well, it depends on who turns up. 
My first thought is to export both the global enable/disable interfaces
and touch_softlockup_watchdog.  But on second thoughts maybe
touch_softlockup_watchdog is completely redundant, since you'd only do
it if you're holding off timer interrupts, but the lockup only gets
reported if timer interrupts are enabled (in other words, the best it
can tell you is "you locked up for a while there", which isn't terribly
useful).  So perhaps this can just be dropped.  I haven't looked at the
users to see what they're really trying to achieve.
The enable/disable interfaces are more generally useful in that you can
say "I *know* I'm going to go away for a while, so don't bother
reporting it".
