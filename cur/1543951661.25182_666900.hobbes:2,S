This one looks fine to me.  I would like the comment above the function to
be updated to describe its new purpose, and to document its return value's
meaning.  
Also, I'm not sure if there is a kernel code formatting convention that
particularly excludes an empty block ({}, equiv to ;) containing just
comments.  But I don't recall seeing that style used in the kernel.
(I don't mind it personally for this case given what the obvious
alternatives would look like.)
Thanks,
Roland
