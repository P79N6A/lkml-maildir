Hi,
By looking into the structure of GDT as used by linux kernel(file
include/asm/desc.c, kernel ver 2.4), it appears as if linux kernel does not
use the "call gate descriptors" for system call handling. Is this correct?
If it is correct then how does the system calls are handled by the kernel
(basically how does the control gets transferred to kernel)? Does the CS of
linux kernel handles the system calls? what are the advantages of using
this scheme?
otherwise can anyone give pointers in the kernel source where i can look
into?
Thanks,
daljeet.
