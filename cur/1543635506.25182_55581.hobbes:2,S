Subject: Re: How many copies to get from NIC RX to user read()?

So, to make sure I have this right:
When the data is processed from the NIC
  tcp_rcv_established() is called in processing it
    if a user process is waiting on the socket
      iovec copy data to the user
    else
      copy it to receive_queue or backlog_queue
When the user tries read (in any way) a socket
  iovec copy from receive_queue or backlog_queue
E.g., if the user is ready for the data, dump it straight from SKBs. Else, 
don't waste SKBs on a lazy (or busy) user and copy the data to a queue.
If this is right, I'm happy :) If it's wrong, please correct. 
Thx,
