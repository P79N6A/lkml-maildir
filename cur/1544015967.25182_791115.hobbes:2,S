Hi,
I got the following building error for 2.6.29-rc1.

objcopy: unrecognized option `--strip-unneeded-symbols'
# objcopy --version

The option --strip-unneeded-symbols is only available on higher version, 
but not exists on binutils-2.15.
Seems to keep Makefile compatible on all kinds of circumstances. Like,
quiet_cmd_kstrip = STRIP   $@
       cmd_kstrip = $(OBJCOPY) --wildcard $(addprefix --strip-symbols 
,$(filter %/scripts/strip-symbols,$^)) $< $@
