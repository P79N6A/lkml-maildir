Subject: Relocation overflow with modules on Alpha

I compiled Linux 2.6.0 for Alpha, and it mostly works, except the
somewhat large modules.  They fail to load with the message
"Relocation overflow vs section 17", or some other section number.
I've seen this with scsi-mod, nfsd, snd-page-alloc and possibly some
more.  Compiling them statically works.  What's going on?
