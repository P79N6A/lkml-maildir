How would you do sparse file support with passthrough loopback that 
doesn't use pagecache?
Holes are allocated at get_block function provided by each filesystem and 
the function gets a buffer that is supposed to be in the pagecache. Now if 
you want to allocate holes without pagecache, there's a problem --- new 
interface to all filesystems is needed.
It could be possible to use pagecache interface for filling holes and 
passthrough interface for other requests --- but get_block is allowed to 
move other blocks on the filesystem (and on UFS it really does), so 
calling get_block to fill a hole could move other unrelated blocks which 
would result in desychronized block map and corruption of both 
filesystems.
