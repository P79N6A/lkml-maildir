  Well, I write exactly to share experience and work towards having
best practices for backlight, etc. control, reusable on wide range of
embedded/handheld devices.
  We in handhelds.org codebase have attached patch* to make corgi_bl
more suitable for general use. This patch was submitted to Richard
(so, more votes needed ;-) ). Otherwise, snippet I pasted is from real
machine implementation, HP iPaq h4000.
  As for keyboard backlight, another port we have, HTC Universal, has:
normal indicator LEDs, keyboard backlight, flashlight, ring vibra. All
of these are handled via Generic LED API:
http://handhelds.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/linux/kernel26/arch/arm/mach-pxa/htcuniversal/htcuniversal_leds.c?rev=1.6&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup
  To show that it is not an anomaly, but hopefully, a trend, here's
vibra driver for the upcoming OpenMoko phone:

  So, if you have freedom to add keyboard backlight control to your
userspace, that would allow you to do many interesting things without
disturbing the kernel.
[*] Optimized for size, full one should patch <asm/arch/sharpsl.h> of
course.
