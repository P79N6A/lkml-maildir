Hi all,
Still having problems with my USB mouse and keyboard.
- With kernel 2.3.15, there seems to be occasional (20% of key-presses) very
high latency before key events are passed from the USB keyboard on to other
layers. Around a few seconds. Characters get repeated due to the key-up
event getting delayed.
- When using my USB mouse under X, the mouse pointer continues to move in
the direction it was moving last only at around 2 increments/s (delta x & y
is not being zero'd when the interrupts stop being generated?).
With kernel 2.3.16, the X server fails to open the mouse device
(/dev/usbmouse setup as IMPS/2, char, major 10, minor 32), and exits. The
keyboard works somewhat better, with the occasional hiccup.
My Philips PCA645VC USB web-cam isn't recognised. I think it's CPiA based,
but when I compile in support for it (w/ v4l), it isn't identified.
I am reluctant to post bug reports, etc to the USB mailing list, since it's
a closed list, and I don't have the connectivity to subscribe and get lots
of email all the time. Once I'm back at uni though.....
I can supply information about system and peripherals on demand. Just tell
me what....
All email CC'd to this address please.
Thanks,
    Dan
