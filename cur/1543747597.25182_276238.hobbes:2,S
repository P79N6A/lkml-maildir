Yes, and 2.4 uses sizeof in the third argument, thus size_t is the most
natural replacement.

You get that when you use size_t for the type, which also gives some hint
that the old definition was an unfortunate mistake and might prevent other
people from "fixing" it again.  Putting a pointer here just adds to the
confusion and should be avoided, IMHO.
