Yes I know this. Actually, booting with "devfs=nomount s" is the only
way to update the boot record with lilo and my existing lilo.conf.
If I boot with devfs=nomount, I *can* ls /dev, without segfaulting.
I don't want to access or use any device in /dev, I just want to stat
/dev and see what's inside. There's something wrong with (I suspect)
devfsd and the way it populates /dev with symlinks, whick make /dev
un-listable but still usable, somewhat.

I have no idea. Any other debian users reporting this ?
