Subject: [PATCH] [SPARSE] increase MAXNEST constant
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The MAXNEST constant in sparse is currently too small for
checking most of the kernel files. The deepest nesting
I found in the kernel is 25, so MAXNEST=32 should probably
be sufficient. It would be nice to check overruns here,
but I did not know where to best do it.
The problem is hidden when sparse is compiled with gcc-3.2 
or earlier, but causes segmentation faults with gcc-3.3.
