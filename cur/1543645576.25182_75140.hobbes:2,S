UUIDs are something that many people have asked for in struct device. I've 
put it off because they're used in only a few places today, because it's 
impossible to standardize them across different device types, and it's 
difficult to extract one from devices that don't inherently support them. 
It's a valid request though. What we've talked about is:
- making it struct device::char * uuid;
- the bus that discovers the device is responsible for allocating and 
  freeing the field. 
- It must be a NULL-terminated ASCII string. 
- It will be exported in the device's drivefs directory in a file 'uuid'.
Anything else?
