I had an idea for how to solve this.  Search the archives for
"serialization" or "serialize".
Basically, it involves creating a better interface to a better "dump".
You do
	cat foo/serialize > foo.img
and send foo.img over the network.  Or you just tell mutt/scp/whatever
to grab foo/serialize instead of foo.  Can't be worse than a mac
resource fork, and it looks more user-friendly to me.
