	egcs doesn't per default turn on  -fstrict-aliasing  processing,
	but gcc 2.9 will (or so we are told).
	All in all, following alias related options are available at
	the egcs 1.1.2:
$ egcs -v --help 2>&1 | grep alias
  -fstrict-aliasing       Assume strict aliasing rules apply
  -fargument-noalias-global Assume arguments do not alias each other or globals
  -fargument-noalias      Assume arguments may alias globals but not each other
  -fargument-alias        Specify that arguments may alias each other & globals
  -fstructure-noalias     Assume structure / array reference and fixed scalar cannot alias
	For an educative experience, try compiling your kernel with that
	switch, and tell what happens ?
	egcs wizards have tried, and are telling that Linux kernel
	violates so many of C9X aliasing rules, that there will be
	major pain...  (This includes e.g. DaveM, who is one of the
	primary Linux network subsystem hackers.)
