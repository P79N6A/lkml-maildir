On P4s cli/sti is quite costly, let's says 100+ cycles. That is mostly
because it synchronizes the CPU partly. The Intel tables say 26/36 cycles
latency, but in practice it seems to take longer because of the 
synchronization.
I would assume this is the worst case, everywhere else it should
be cheaper (except perhaps in some virtualized environments)
On P-M and AMD K7/K8 it is only a few cycles difference.
