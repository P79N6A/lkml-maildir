pci-skeleton.c and several of Don's drivers actually do do something 
else on TxUnderrun, twiddle DMA burst settings:
         if ((intr_status & TxUnderrun)
                 && (np->tx_config & TxThresholdField) != 
TxThresholdField) {
                 long ioaddr = dev->base_addr;
                 np->tx_config += TxThresholdInc;
                 writel(np->tx_config, ioaddr + TxMode);
                 np->stats.tx_fifo_errors++;
         }
I wonder how feasible it is to do that on 3c59x hardware?
