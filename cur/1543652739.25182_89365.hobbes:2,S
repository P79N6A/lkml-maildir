I couldn get ksymoops to give me anything useful,   there is a kernel panic
after the oops and the kernel is unbootable.  If I comment out the problematic
lock and recompile, the kernel boots, but is changed and the ksyms file doesnt
match.
This problem is reproducible in any 2.4 kernel since 2.4.13.   I tracked it
down to the lock by hacking in lots of printk 's. to see exactly where the
Oops occurred.....   The call to down() seems to invoke some inline asm code
in include/asm-i386/semaphore.h    and I can't go further to see what the
problem was.
I hope someone knowledgeable can help!
In particular, can this be fixed by initializing something in cpia_usb.c
by adding something to the declaration: 
static struct usb_driver cpia_driver = {
        name:           "cpia",
        probe:          cpia_probe,
        disconnect:     cpia_disconnect,
        id_table:       cpia_id_table,
};
Or is it completely a usb.c problem outside my scope as cpia maintainer?
For what its worth, here is a manually transcribed oops console screen:
