Hi,
I have a question on Linux kernel 2.4.22 vs 2.4.24. I am observing that the
machine running 2.4.22 kernel reports more file descriptor in use by:
cat /proc/sys/fs/file-nr
compared to machine running 2.4.24 kernel. It is my belief that both of these
systems are used in roughly similar manner.
Would like to know if this observation could be attributed to kernel version
difference.
Thanks in advance,
Soumen
