Is this the reason why my RedHat 6.0 system accepts NFS when run with
the 2.2.5-22 kernel, but not when I compile 2.2.10 and run under that?
If so, then...
 1. I'm a "me too" as well.
 2. What can I do to get it working until such time as the patches
    in question do go into the stock kernel?
Best wishes from Riley.
