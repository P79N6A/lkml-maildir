Hello lists,
I've had some XFS troubles today, and after cleaning up with xfs_repair and so 
I'm stuck with one undeletable directory in /lost+found:
precious:/lost+found# ls -l
total 8
drwxrwxrwx  2 root root 8192 Jun 19  2005 4207214
precious:/lost+found# rm -r 4207214
rm: cannot remove directory `4207214': Directory not empty
precious:/lost+found# ls -l 4207214/
total 0
precious:/lost+found# 
So there's one dir 4207214 there, and i can rename it and whatever, just not 
remove it.
xfs_repair didn't solve the problem.
Any ideas?
Thanks,
Jan
