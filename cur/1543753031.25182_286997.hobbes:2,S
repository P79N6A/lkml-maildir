State machine for non-boot CPUs currently goes:
 ------------
|            v
|	CPU_UP_PREPARE <-----
|	     |		     |
|	     v		     |
|	__cpu_up() ---> CPU_UP_CANCELED
|	     |
|	     v
|	CPU_ONLINE
|	     |
|	     v
|	CPU_DOWN_PREPARE <----
|	     |		      |
|	     v	              |
|	__cpu_down()---> CPU_DOWN_FAILED
|	     |
|	     v
|	CPU_DEAD
|	     |
 ------------
You've tacked a CPU_UP_PREPARE_EARLY above this state for two
architectures, which only gets called at boot, and only is used by
timers, to fix the fact that those archs don't actually follow this
state machine yet.
And sure enough, you've added a potential bug, since timer_jiffies
doesn't get reset to jiffies when a CPU comes back up.  Really, a
specific hack as below is required.

AFAICT from a quick reading, that's not true.  CPU0 will bump the
jiffies, which is all you need: local interrupts not required.

Again, I don't think so: the other CPUs are sitting in start_secondary()
waiting for __cpu_up().
As I said, I will try it and see.  It would certainly be the nicest
solution.  If not, I'll code a "timer_smp_boot_init()" function for x86
myself.
Cheers,
Rusty.
