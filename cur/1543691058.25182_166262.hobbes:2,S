That's true. But I think sharing the same source/binary in some
reasonable fashion is much more beneficial to Linux and the users,
especially because we can improve the quality and performance more
efficiently. 
I think the way Andi implemented (see below, for example) is one of the
best solutions as far as I think of. 
extern inline void prefetchw(const void *x)
{
	alternative_input(ASM_NOP4,
			  "prefetchw (%1)",
			  X86_FEATURE_3DNOW,
			  "r" (x));
}
Thanks,
Jun
