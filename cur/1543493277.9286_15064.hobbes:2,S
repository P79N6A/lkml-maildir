Hi all.
We have a problem with a Siemens Primergy 870 edition, with
two Xeon Pentium II 450 processors, and an ICP Vortex RAID
controller.
The Primergy is  a server with two on-board UW-SCSI
ncr53c8xx controllers, and an Intel Ether Express Pro 10/100
ethernet controller.
The first problem came out when we tried to recompile the
kernel in order to support multiprocessor. The kernel panics
at boot, apparently when it detects the ICP controller.
The second problem is that a couple of times the server
freezed while doing disk activity (copying from a disk on a
samba share, copying from the floppy disk to the hard disk)
The third problem is that doing the cat of /proc/pci, the
video controller (a Cirrus Logic 5446) marked as the
interrupt assigned a 255?
Last but not least: it is a kernel 2.0.36, from RH software,
recompiled with the latest patch from ICP Vortex for the
controller.

Please answer directly to me.
