1)	Fetch the Solaris install CD images from:
	
http://wwws.sun.com/software/solaris/solaris-express/get.html
	Solaris is free for personal use and free for being used to 
	develop OSS.
2)	"unzip" the CD images
3)	use cdrecord to write the CDs
4)	Start installation with CD#1
	......
5)	Take a look at /etc/path_to_inst and call "man path_to_inst"
The used method even works nicely for USB devices.
