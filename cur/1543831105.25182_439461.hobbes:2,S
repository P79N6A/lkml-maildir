For a "big" distribution that runs on modern kernels, then by all means, 
build something around glibc.  The additional disk space and memory is a 
proverbial drop in the bucket.
However, I don't think it's realistic for smaller systems.

The stuff that's bundled with the kernel are replacements for kernel 
functionality.  The purpose of bundling is that kernel functionality can 
be removed.  Obviously, utility developers can build with klibc; this is 
already supported by several out-of-tree utilities, including udev. 
Should udev be bundled with the kernel?  It could be debated; however, 
it doesn't really affect the situation at hand.
