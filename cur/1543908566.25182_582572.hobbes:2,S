Here's my complete argument:
Regardless of how you categorize "read", "write", "execute", and  
"doesnt-need-protection" in your policy language, I can write an  
SELinux policy and a list of labels which expresses that policy.   
Moreover, without too much work I can probably write a Perl script to  
do it for you.  On the other hand I can only do that if you tell me  
exactly how you want to categorize those things, though.  In my  
personal opinion they cannot be reasonably categorized without  
breaking all sorts of tools or leaving gaping holes; precisely the  
reason that SELinux uses such a fine-grained list.

So "bind()" doesn't present a security hole at all and any program  
may bind to any port?  Sounds fun!  I'm sure lots of crackers would  
love to get ahold of an account on such a web-server; what havoc they  
could wreak!  Even the <1024 restriction doesn't sufficiently limit  
things these days, as many critical services use ports >=1024.

Ok, you want sample policy to match your "MLS" sample?  For  
convenience here's one more macro:
define(`rx',`r(`$1',`$2') x(`$1',`$2')')
type unclass;
type c;
type s;
type ts;
rx(c, unclass)
rx(s, c)
rx(s, unclass)
rx(ts, s)
rx(ts, c)
rx(ts, unclass)
In case you don't have the policy you typed into your email, it looks  
almost identical with a few exceptions for slightly modified syntax:
> C        Unclass rx
> S        C       rx
> S        Unclass rx
> TS       S       rx

Whoops, I think I must have smashed the delete key or something while  
sending.  Here's the paragraphs which got elided:
Well, yes, but a policy which completely ignores future expandability  
can't be expanded upon regardless.  It would also be very hard to add  
new policy without a lot of duplication under your system.  On the  
other hand, with SELinux you can very easily add attribute-based  
policy so adding new capabilities is as simple as sticking existing  
attributes on newly defined types.  For example:
type my_log_t, file_type, log_file;
type my_log_daemon, daemon;
Right there I just gave permission for the logrotate to recycle files  
labelled my_log_t, which the sysadmin and audit admin can also read  
(and the audit admin can delete).  I also gave permission for my  
daemon to send SIGCHLD to init, and for init/initscripts to send it a  
SIGTERM/SIGQUIT.  All without writing a SINGLE policy rule.   
Basically all of those existing behaviors are found in allow rules  
built on the "file_type", "log_file", and "daemon" attributes.

This is fundamentally broken:  First of all we have no fd revoke  
support yet, so all a user has to do is start the game at 5:05pm just  
before they leave, then leave it running in the background during the  
day for them to play at leisure.  Secondly, you can already do the  
same thing with DAC and a PAM groups-from-time-of-day module, I don't  
see why such a thing is special enough to need MAC.  Thirdly, I could  
do exactly the same thing with an SELinux boolean and a cronjob (once  
we get proper revoke support):
## Rule to allow cron to tweak the "can_play_games" boolean value
if (can_play_games) {
	## Insert game-playing allow rules here
}
Then in cron:
0  8 * * * root setsebool can_play_games false
0 17 * * * root setsebool can_play_games true

By this logic, every program will always have the same label, unless  
you recode every program to explicitly change it when it starts;  
precisely the thing that the SELinux type transitions were designed  
to avoid.

Oh, say something like "Oh, drat, I wanted this daemon to run as some  
other type".  Unless you relabel the files and relaunch the daemon  
the system will have no idea how the system will change.  And if you  
let arbitrary root processes relabel things on the fly then you've  
lost all the security advantages to a MAC system.

Well, it's a syntactic construction to describe an idea, ergo it's a  
language.

I think you may be making assumptions about the behaviour of SELinux  
based on what other OSes do which don't hold:
(a)  SELinux does not care about user id, current directory, time of  
day, etc.  It cares solely about 3 things:
the Subject, the Object, and the Action.  For example, if an init  
script attempts to execute the apache binary then SELinux gets the  
following data for parameters:   
subject="system_u:system_r:initrc_t:SystemLow-SystemHigh"  
object="system_u:object_r:httpd_exec_t:SystemLow" action="file- 
 >execute".
(b)  SELinux does NOT have a capability which overrides it.  If you  
want to do something that the policy categorically does not allow,  
you have 2 choices:  change the policy or disable SELinux.  You can  
also use a policy which disables both of those options

Which means that for every new category/level-alteration you have to  
modify a significant portion of your policy.  With SELinux I get to  
either add 2 lines to a local policy module or run a couple  
"semanage" commands.

Umm, how so?  Any of these will work:
   * The security administrator creates my /www_S and /www_TS  
folders, labels them, and remembers not to run "restorecon" on those  
folders.
   * The security administrator loads a local policy module with just  
an fc file containing:
       /www_S(/.*)?  system_u:object_r:web_docs_t:Secret
       /www_TS(/.*)? system_u:object_r:web_docs_t:TopSecret
   * The security administrator runs these commands:
       semanage fcontext -a -r Secret-Secret       -s system_u -t  
web_docs_t '/www_S(/.*)?'
       semanage fcontext -a -r TopSecret-TopSecret -s system_u -t  
web_docs_t '/www_TS(/.*)?'

Well, you were the one who asked.  It's mostly irrelevant to the  
discussion since the *same* kind of stuff is found in almost every  
module in the tresys-distributed refpolicy.

Ok, fine, how does "moving data around a system" require anything  
more than bog-standard user-level privileges?  Normal users under  
Linux are not permitted to change "security.*" attributes at all, but  
they may bind to sockets, etc.  You can define a "capability" which  
lets you do all that, but then you're just blindly giving processes  
more privileges than they need to complete an operation.  Why should  
you get the "rename all files" priv when all you need is "Make my log  
files get $LABEL when I put them in /var/log/mydaemon/"?

You can call them "process capabilities" or "magic attributes",  
they're the same thing, just more fine-grained.  Instead of (Note: r1  
== subject role, r2 == target role, t2 == target type):
   mlsconstrain process transition ( (r1 == r2) || (t1 ==  
i_am_a_role_changing_capability) )
you have (Note: t1 == subject type):
   mlsconstrain process transition ( (r1 == r2) || (r1 == system_r &&  
t1 == i_am_a_login_process && t2 == i_am_a_user_entrypoint) )
The latter is like the former, except instead of one single ultimate  
"change-any-role" capability, you have a capability which allows a  
system login process to change roles *ONLY* if it's also changing to  
a user entrypoint.  Please tell me which you think is more secure.

If your security policy sucks then you might as well not have MAC at  
all.  At least under SELinux the absolute worst possible case is that  
you always fall back to DAC-based security.

So how do you selectively label files based on criteria such as  
"where did I get put"?  How do you distinguish between a "log file"  
which is create-and-append-only, a "database file" which I can modify  
however I want to, and a "unix socket" which I can bind in /var/run  
and get connections from user processes?

No, AppArmor doesn't.  It says: "/usr/sbin/httpd may not access /etc/ 
shadow", for example, whereas SELinux with the proposed extension  
says: "Only the 'passwd' program or 'vipw' by a sysadmin may modify  
*ANY* password shadow file, and if I create a "shadow" file in *ANY*  
etc_t directory then it's automatically a shadow file.  The  
difference is also in the treatment of hard-links.  Under SELinux I  
can guarantee that the data in the shadow_t file is secure, no matter  
where somebody manages to get it linked to, and in addition I can  
guarantee that nobody can spoof me and make me create the shadow file  
elsewhere or with the wrong label.

Hmm, I haven't seen anything pass LKML and digging in the

You're welcome.  I endeavor to poke my nose into every little LSM-
