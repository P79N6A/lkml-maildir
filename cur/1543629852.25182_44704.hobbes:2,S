The kernel provides gettimeofday() which give micro seconds AND is
usually quite accurate.  On machines of about 800 MHZ and better you
can, sometimes, even get the same value on back to back readings.
The high-res-timers patch (see sig. below) implements the POSIX clocks
and timers which return values in nanoseconds, but the resolution, due
to jitter and such is still in the range of micro seconds.
If, on the other hand, you are trying to measure execution time of some
task that blocks during that time, you are in a world of hurt.  The
kernel allocates 1/HZ chunks of elapsed time to what ever task it finds
running at the 1/HZ tick.  There is NO attempt by the kernel to refine
this measurement.
