I just did the raw output, so my output was from
	git show --pretty=fuller -r e338b7
which isn't the default, but it's useful if you want to see both committer 
and author information (and the raw format is just because I wasn't 
interested in the diff itself, just looking at how many files where 
changed).

Yeah, we're talking about the same commit.

It's a perfectly good commit. BUT IT IS NOT A MERGE, AND IT IS NOT A DIFF 
THAT I WANT TO SEE COMING IN FROM AN OUTSIDE TREE!
Basically, in the DVB tree you have absolutely _no_ business in "merging" 
work from my tree as a patch, especially when the patch you merge has 
absolutely zero to do with DVB. You just applied a 5000-line patch to the 
tree, with no merge message other than "Merge from Linus tree", and no 
attribution about what the f*ck was merged, and why.
THAT is the part I'm unhappy with. The git tree is not "corrupt" from a 
technical standpoint (it passes fsck). It's "corrupt" because it contains 
a patch that shouldn't be there, that is mis-attributed, and that 
incorrectly claims to be a merge when it isn't - it's just a random patch 
generated against my tree.
