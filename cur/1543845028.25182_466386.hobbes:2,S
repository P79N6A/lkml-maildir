(Sorry for the delay; been on vacation.)
Heh, I ran into the same lock nesting issues as you when I first tried
to fix this; the lock debugging code found it for me.  I asked for
feedback on the locking issue when I submitted the patch, but no one
had any opinions then, so I chose consistency over possible
contention.  Al Viro snorted at the idea of consistency in the results
of statfs (I paraphrase his IRC remarks), and thinking about it
further, I realized the debug code should not be doing these checks in
statfs anyway; only on mount and unmount.  This is because it appears
that the block group accounting and the overall fs accounting are done
non-atomically - see group_reserve_blocks() for example - and part of
what the code does is reconcile these two numbers.  It is legal for a
valid fs to have the block group summaries and the fs-wide summaries
out of sync, so the debug code could erroneously report an error,
leading some poor soul on a wild goose chase.  Removing this code from
statfs also happens to fix the locking issues nicely.
Rewriting this has been on my todo list for about 6 months now -
anyone interested in grabbing it?  I'm on #linuxfs on irc.oftc.net if
anyone wants to chat about it.
