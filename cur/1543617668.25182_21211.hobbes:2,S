arpd will _not_ help you at all. Without tuning above you are lost
in any case, with this tuning arpd is useless.
Not quite useless though, but its task has nothing to do with
size of table. Its task is reducing broadcasting on LAN, which is
importnat but a second order effect yet. Well, you can use arpd
from iproute2.
