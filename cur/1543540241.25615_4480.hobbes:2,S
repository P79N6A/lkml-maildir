This is an old question and was hashed out many times on the original
FSSTND list (yikes, back in the early 90's!).  If you are creating a general
purpose distribution, then these files are _not_ local to anything, so
/usr/local is trivially the wrong place.  If you are creating a distribution
local to your company, then feel free to use /usr/local.  If you are
automating an install for your environment, then feel free to use /usr/local.
Any distribution that uses /usr/local for general distribution is not FSSTND
(sorry, FHS) compliant.
It's very simple, really.
: Your packager should handle this. If it's not part of OS then it should be
: installed in /opt - this part of FHS looks Ok.
And this had the most arguments of all :-)  Probably 60% of all traffic
was about this :-)
