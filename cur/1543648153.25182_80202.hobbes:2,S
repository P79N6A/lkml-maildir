   _bh is not a "base handler" it stands for "bottom half".
All of these phrases mean the same thing to me.
Do you want to know what is different?  "tasklets",
they are a totally different abstraction, as are
"work queues".
"base handler" and "bottom half" all refer to an execution
context, and these days that means softirq.
