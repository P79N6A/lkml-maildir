I have Problems using the radeon Framebuffer on my Notebook. It is a Sony PCG-GR114MK with a Radeon Mobility.
Kernel shows the following message. It only works with vesa-framebuffer.
Feb 19 23:41:54 hannonb kernel: radeonfb: ref_clk=2700, ref_div=60, xclk=16600 from BIOS
Feb 19 23:41:54 hannonb kernel: radeonfb: panel ID string: 1024x768                
Feb 19 23:41:54 hannonb kernel: radeonfb: detected DFP panel size from BIOS: 1024x768
Feb 19 23:41:54 hannonb kernel: radeonfb: cannot map FB
Any ideas what I could do?
