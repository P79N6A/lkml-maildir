Hi Adrian,
This looks like the source of some stupidity.
http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=555
Which is even more fun when you see this.

I haven't ever seen MySQL doing something that stupid (stupid because if
it's required, it _really_ has to be done at runtime).
Which version of MySQL have you seen such an SMP check in?
