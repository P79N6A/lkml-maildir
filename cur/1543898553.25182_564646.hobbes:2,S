Oh come on, this claim clearly isn't justified. How on earth is passing 
vfsmounts down the lsm hooks supposed to break vfs layering? We are not 
proposing to pass additional information down to file systems. There is no 
barrier between the vfs and lsm hooks for vfsmounts even today -- only look 
at the inode_getattr hook; it already gets a vfsmount.
Without vfsmount we cannot tell where in the namespace we are, but that 
information is essential for any kind of pathname based mechanism, AA or not, 
and even for plain reporting.
LSM as a framework is supposed to allow different security mechanisms to be 
plugged in. It isn't flexible enough for us right now, and so we are 
proposing to extend it. What can be wrong about that?
