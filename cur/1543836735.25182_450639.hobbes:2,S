kmap() is a nasty thing.  It has theoretical deadlock problems (which used
to be real ones back in the 2.4 days) and the present implementation uses a
kernel-wide lock.
We've been gradually and sporadically working to make kmap() go away, so
please let's not do anything which encourages its use.
kmap_atomic() is much preferred.  Can this initiative be recast around
kmap_atomic()?
