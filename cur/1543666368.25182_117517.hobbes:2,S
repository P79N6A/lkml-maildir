I think the subject is a bit misleading:
There seems to be a problem with interrupt routing if he enables IO-APIC 
support, both with a Broadcom nic and a 3com nic.
Either the MP table that is supplied by the bios is incorrect [wouldn't 
be a big surprise - I think Linux is the only OS that looks at MP tables 
of uniprocessor machines], or the ACPI interpreter did something wrong.
Do you use the latest bios for your motherboard? Which chipset?
