I just made a diff against xfs-cvs-20010917 with your changes. 
Obviously I can't merge the changes into the main patch since not
everyone has XFS, but I will make the patch available.

Good.  Then we can probably mark XFS as preempt safe (no reason to think
otherwise).  Those file operations were on the XFS partitions, right?
