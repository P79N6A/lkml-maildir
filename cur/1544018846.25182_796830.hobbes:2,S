I merged a the one you resent privately as this one didn't apply at all.
The code is in topic/slqb/core branch of slab.git and should appear in
linux-next tomorrow.
Testing and especially performance testing is welcome. If any of the HPC
people are reading this, please do give SLQB a good beating as Nick's
plan is to replace both, SLAB and SLUB, with it in the long run. As
Christoph has expressed concerns over latency issues of SLQB, I suppose
it would be interesting to hear if it makes any difference to the
real-time folks.
