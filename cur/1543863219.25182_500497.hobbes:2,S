I am using the following patch (with 2.6.17) to shut up these messages 
with my repeater cable - found it on the linux-usb mailinglist some time 
ago when facing the same problem, but did not write down from who it is.
(Does not silence all log messages when usb debugging is enabled, but when 
it is disabled there is no endless log-stream anymore and the cable works)
I tried to fix the logging-change to the usb id, but the cable uses 
exactly the same chip and id as the two chips inside my 7port usb-hub.
