FWIW, I agree, though the licensing of the Intel firmware
prevents that iirc.  The biggest problem I face with this driver
in Fedora kernels is users mismatching firmware rev with the
driver version. Another problem that disappears if the two
are shipped together.
Of course this would then bring out the armchair lawyers on
the list and cause another 500 emails debating whether it
violates the gpl.
