Hello
Not a bug report, nothing critical (hopefully), just a question - in rtc.c
driver on time-set ioctl() the following is done:
	save_freq_select = CMOS_READ(RTC_FREQ_SELECT);
	CMOS_WRITE((save_freq_select|RTC_DIV_RESET2), RTC_FREQ_SELECT);
which writes 0x7X to rtc regs=ister 0xA... Why? I read a few documents and
all agree on, what's expressed in one of them as "bits 4-6 should be 0x2,
other values don't do anything useful on PCs, really..." VERY curious...
Thanks
Guennadi
