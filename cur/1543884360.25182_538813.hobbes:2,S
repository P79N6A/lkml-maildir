All of the above don't use mainline kernels.
That doesn't constitute using it.

Talk is cheap. Do they have working code to use it?

That's a good idea in general, but should be generalized (available
independently), not hidden in your subsystem. I know a couple of places
who could use this successfully.

See upcomming paravirt code for a way to do this.

Why can't you just generally forbid probes from doing all of this?
It would greatly simplify your code, wouldn't it?
Keep it simple please.

Having lots of flags to do things differently optionally normally
starts up all warning lights of early over design. While Linux
has this sometimes it is generally only in mature old subsystems.
But when something is freshly merged it shouldn't be like this.
That is because code tends to grow more complicated over its livetime
and when it is already complicated at the beginning it will eventually
fall over (you can study current slab as a poster child of this)
