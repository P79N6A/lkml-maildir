As a dangerous rule of thumb, LOC ~ code size.  More code size = bigger
kernel = less (buffercache|user memory).  <flamesuit>This is a fear of Linux
kernel developers - Linux ending up as slow as say, Solaris on low end
machines (even if it kicks butt on 6144-way SMP).</flamesuit>
Numbers are often good in arguments like this.  ie, how big is the ext2fs
module under Linux/MIPS, compared to the xfs module under Irix?  [Comparing
with Linux/i386 should probably be avoided, because i386 code is (generally)
more instructions/word, even if you need a few extra million transistors to
decode it :)].
In summary, I guess it is important that the filesystem not only performs at
incredible speeds on high end SMP, but also it's best and average case
performance on limited memory and IO machines is also good.
