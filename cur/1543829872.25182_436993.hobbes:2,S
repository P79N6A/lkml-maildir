Hello!
I'm running a 64-bit kernel and 32-bit userspace. There seems to be some
unimplemented compability ioctls regarding USB. Dmesg shows the
following:
[184966.543022] ioctl32(hald-probe-hidd:10760): Unknown cmd fd(4)
cmd(81004806){01} arg(ffb52dd0) on /dev/usb/hiddev0
and
[50974.410204] ioctl32(vmware-vmx:3470): Unknown cmd fd(140)
cmd(40109980){00} arg(ffb551a0) on /proc/bus/usb/002/001
Have it been only forgotten or are there other more serious reasons that
these ioctls are missing?
