Keep in mind that insmod current needs to incorporate a full ELF
interpreter in userspace (and the source code needs to know about
all the types of relocations and jump for each arch and for 32
and 64 bit ELF.  Horrible stuff really.  If we could cleanup the
kernel's insmod implementation to require merely a syscall
passing a filename to the kernel, it would sure make the
initramfs smaller and simpler.  I believe Rusty made a patch to
do this sort of thing....
