lmbench's timing loops are loops, in other words they want to be able to do
something N times to get accurate numbers.  The only time they don't run 
it N times is if the run takes longer than some threshold, I think it was
either a second or 5 seconds.
If you tell me what you want to measure I can probably code up something
for you.  Or tell you how to do it - there is a lot of infrastructure in
lmbench which makes writing new tests trivial and I would hope you would
do that.  For example, suppose you had a new system call "sysWhizzy"
and you wanted to benchmark it.  An lmbench program which would do that
would look like
#include "bench.h"
main()
{
	BENCH(sysWhizzy(args), 0);
	micro("Whizzy", get_n());
}
Pretty easy, no?
