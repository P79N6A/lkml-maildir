According to Jeff Garzik:

OK, I get the theory.  But AFAICT this drive hasn't remapped *any*
sectors.  Yet.  (Which would not be impossible; it's a relatively
new drive, a few months old at most.)  Quoting smartctl:
ID# ATTRIBUTE_NAME          FLAG     VALUE WORST THRESH TYPE      UPDATED  WHEN_FAILED RAW_VALUE
  5 Reallocated_Sector_Ct   0x0033   100   100   050    Pre-fail  Always       -       0
196 Reallocated_Event_Count 0x0032   100   100   000    Old_age   Always       -       0
197 Current_Pending_Sector  0x0032   100   100   000    Old_age   Always       -       3
198 Offline_Uncorrectable   0x0030   100   100   000    Old_age   Offline      -       0
This seems to suggest that there are three *candidate* sectors with
reallocation pending, none of which have actually been remapped (yet).
If so, drive replacement would perhaps be premature.
I suppose it's time to read up on the details of the SMART spec.
