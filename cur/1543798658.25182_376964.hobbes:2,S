Personally, I don't care much, however it does reflect rather poorly  
on _your_ netiquette.  Might I remind you that _you_ were the one who  
made the thread private in the first place?  It is generally  
considered poor form to reply privately to someone (indicating that  
you want to continue off-list), and then as soon as they continue  
discussion in off-list fashion, bringing it back on-list whining  
about how they called you names in a private thread.
I've had enough of this nonsense, and I'm just beginning to realize  
that I've been feeding the troll and lowering the S/N ratio.  PLONK!
On a slightly nicer note, I would like to formally apologize to the  
list for the noise that has resulted, and will attempt to be more  
reserved with my replies in the future.
Cheers,
Kyle Moffett
