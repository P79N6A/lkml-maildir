if it were the same area of code, and if all your cleanups were fine, 
i'd agree. But even assuming that all your cleanups are fine, this is 
90% /not/ the same area of code. Thomas's changes refactor the 
clockevents infrastructure, while passingly touching clocksources too, 
on an as-needed basis. Your changes touch the clocksource area of code. 
In that sense Thomas' changes are more important and you should be able 
to refactor your queue ontop of Thomas' (trivial) change to the 
clocksources code.
You are complaining that we didnt pick up your high-flux cleanups, but 
we pointed out our reasons. In fact we couldnt really even consider your 
queue because the last version of yours when we did ours was 2 months 
old and yours included the showstopper sched_clock() changes. Your queue 
had all the signs of abandonment, so your injection into this submission 
of the -hrt queue to suggest that your queue is suddenly a 'must have' 
is quite puzzling to me.
