Which ones are enabled. Exactly.

They do if the one enabled this week is "make EAs look like symlinks", and
last week's was "make EAs look like folders".
(Don't blame me, *you're* the one that said "EAs can look like any other object"..)

Right. So please explain what crypto/raw/foo and crypto/inflated/foo.gz give you.

It's got a *LOT* to do with it if I created a *DIRECTORY*, to use *AS A DIRECTORY*,
the way Unix-style systems have done for 3 decades, and suddenly my system is
running like a pig because the kernel decided that it's a .zip file.

Ahem.  "bar.zip' is a *DIRECTORY*. I said 'mkdir bar.zip' - why is it not
acting like a directory?

Fish or cut bait.  You are the one who started handwaving the 'file-as-directory'.
If you don't want it discussed, don't mention it.

No. *YOU* are misunderstanding.  I have a directory 'linux-2.6.12', and
I have a file 'linux-2.6.12.tar.bz2', and I do *NOT* want directory operations
to be silently converted into "let's scribble into the middle of this tar file
and then compress it".  (Hint - work out how long a kernel 'make' would take
if you were doing it inside a .tar.bz2).

So rather than everything working in a funky manner, a program gets to guess
how funky, and in what direction, a given magical directory is....
