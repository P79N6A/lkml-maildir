I don't recall anyone requesting this feature.  Tell me why we should add
it to Linux?

The above tricks may make the code easier to type, but I find they make the
code harder for others to read, and that's more important.  We prefer to
open-code such things.

kfree(0) is permitted.  Some people like to do the double test anyway but I
don't think it adds much here.

whitespace nit: In some places you have spaces after the commas and in
others you do not.

This is the preferred style.
