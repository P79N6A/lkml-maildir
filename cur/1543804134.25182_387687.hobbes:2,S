Hello,
I have released a new version of the perfmon base package.
This release is relative to 2.6.16-rc1.
Due to the addition of the migrate_pages() system call, all perfmon
system calls have been shifted by one. As a consequence, you must
relink your applications using the new version of libpfm which
is also released today: libpfm-3.2-060118.
This new kernel patch includes several important changes:
	- added support for the Dual-Core Itanium 2 (Montecito) processor
	- working support for MIPS5K and MIPS20k (by Phil Mucci)
	- lots of cleanups in the PMU description modules. Some common
	  functionalities moved into core (masking of reserved fields)
	- PFM_REGFL_NEMUL64 managed from perfmon core
The new version of the library, libpfm, includes the following changes:
	- added support for MIPS5K, MIPS20K
	- added pfm_get_event_counter() interface with man page
	- added support for compiling using a 32-bit ABI on a 64-bit OS
	  (not available on all platforms, see config.mk)
	- reworked all standalone examples
	- cleanups and fixes in the generic examples
The two packages can be downloaded from the SourceForge website at:

I will be posting the patches directly to LKML for
review very shortly.
Enjoy,
