the newest SMP patch does exactly this. _Most_ boards have synchron cycle
counters, but not all ... We explicitly synchronize the cycle counters at
early bootup time. So i think you should safely assume that they are
synchron.

(yep, i've implemented this after Colin proved via user-space tools that
some systems are not synchron.) Also, it's guaranteed that the CPUs stay
synchron once synchronized.
