BTW, the fact that presence of that kobject is conditional makes life even
uglier - we have to either kfree() or drop a reference to kobject leaving
actual kfree() to its ->release().   While we are at it, when do we remove
the symlinks?  That got to add even more fun for the lifetime rules...
Sigh...  How does one set a script that would mail a warning upon git pull
that introduces any instances of keyword from given set?  I hadn't noticed
that slub was using sysfs when it went into the tree back in May ;-/
