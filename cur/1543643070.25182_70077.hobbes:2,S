The point here is not to optimize latency but to optimize throughput: If the
filesystem is able to recognize that a whole tree is being read, it may issue
read requests for all the blocks of that tree, which are (with a high
probability) in such a close location to each other that all the read requests
can result in a single, large, megabyte-big disk-read-burst, taking few
seconds instead of minutes.
In theory, this also could be implemented explicitly if the application could
tell the kernel "I'm going to read these 100 files in the very near future,
please make them ready for me". But wait, maybe the application can do this
(for regular files, not for directory entries and stat() data): Could it be
efficient if the application used open(file,O_NONBLOCK) for the next 100 files
and subsequent read()s on each of the returned filedescriptors?
