Hi,
the current cs4232 driver is not smp safe, I get this in dmesg when I
try to load it:
ad1848/cs4248 codec driver Copyright (C) by Hannu Savolainen 1993-1996
<Crystal audio controller (CS4236)> at 0x534 irq 5 dma 1,0
do_IRQ waiting for irq lock (holder=0)
wait_on_irq, CPU 0:
irq:  1 [0 1]
bh:   0 [0 0]
It jumps into xmon and I can exit from the debugger. 
A spin_lock(&mylock) call in attach_cs4232() leads to that output:
ad1848/cs4248 codec driver Copyright (C) by Hannu Savolainen 1993-1996
<Crystal audio controller (CS4236)> at 0x534 irq 5 dma 1,0
do_IRQ waiting for irq lock (holder=1)
But it still jumps into xmon. How can we make that driver SMP safe?
There is no maintainer address in the files.
