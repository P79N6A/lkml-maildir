Oh, please no. We'd end up with endless asserts in the networking layer, 
just because David would find it amusing. 
I can just see it now - code bloat hell.
And no, I still don't like ASSERT().
I think the approach should clearly spell what the trouble level is:
	DEBUG(x != y, "x=%d, y=%d\n", x, y);
	WARN(x != y, "crap happens: x=%d y=%d\n", x, y);
	FATAL(x != y, "Aiee: x=%d y=%d\n", x, y);
where the DEBUG one gets compiled out normally (or has some nice per-file
way of being enabled/disabled - a perfect world would expose the on/off in
devicefs as a per-file entity when kernel debugging is on), WARN continues
but writes a message (and normally does _not_ get compiled out), and FATAL
is like our current BUG_ON().
All would print out the filename and line number, the message, and the 
backtrace.
