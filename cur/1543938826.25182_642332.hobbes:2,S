Ah, now I understand your confusion: kallsyms_lookup_name doesn't fill 
the name. It searches the name and returns the address. It is the 
_caller_ that fills the name, not kallsyms_lookup_name.
It is used for stuff like: "give me the address of function foo":
addr = kallsyms_lookup_name("foo");

I think that using KSYM_NAME_LEN would be a nice cleanup for xmon, but 
it is for the powerpc guys to decide if they want to do it. I just 
wanted to point the change in behavior so that it wouldn't go unnoticed.
For all we know, the stack may at that point be close to full and an 
extra 64 bytes may tip it over the edge.

No problem. I always keep an eye out for kallsyms related stuff.
