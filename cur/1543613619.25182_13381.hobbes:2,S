that's how linux handles it and as said incidentally it really looked
intentional to me as well (and Andrew's patch to return error even if
something was written without at least updating "pos" looked wrong). but
without any change ala Andrew, we cannot get errors back from O_SYNC if
at least one byte was written successfully to the cache (not to disk).
So I also see Andrew's point in doing those changes...
