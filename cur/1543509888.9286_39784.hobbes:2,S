In the README-smbmount file in the top dir of 2.0.5a:
Subject: smbmount / smbmnt / smbumount
=============================================================================
The Samba-Team wishes to make known that the above programs are a part
of
the SMBFS software package for the Linux operating system. They are very
definitely NOT part of Samba and are in general NOT supported by the
I couldn't find the snippet referred to by Urban, but I *did* note the
heading in smbmount.c:
   Unix SMB/Netbios implementation.
   Version 2.0.
   SMBFS mount program

Maybe there's hope if Tridgell has the copyright on it.....
On a more constructive note, what in NT/samba combination would cause
the  connection to drop, if everything is working normally?  By
normally, I mean, none of the machines are rebooted, net connections all
fine, etc.  I would really like to have a place to start poking at, even
though I'm no expert C hacker.  If there were some documentation around
describing the sequence of events that happens while a samba share is
mounted (i.e., after the initial mount, when it's trying to stay
mounted), those would be helpful, as well.  Maybe some flowcharts or
something?
This thing has been a nasty bug for a long time.  We need to fix it,
regardless if it's "samba's problem" or "smbfs's problem".  A little
solidarity here would, I think, be a good thing.
I'm kinda surprised Linux detractors haven't picked up on this...
