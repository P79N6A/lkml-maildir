IMHO, it would be really nice (Although I realize this would be a 
humongous
task) if there was a "Linux" ACL system supported by the VFS that is 
backwards
compatible with UNIX perms, POSIX ACLs, and NTFS ACLs (One of the few
things that Microsoft got right).  The fact stands that NT ACLs are 
much more
powerful and useful than their POSIX counterparts (Although some of the
subdirectory inheritance stuff is rather uselessly algorithmically 
complicated.)
I think it would be a major achievement if some kind of design and API 
could
be decided upon, because at least that way there would be some kind of
foundation upon which to build patches.
I'd like to work on a patch for this, but I'm afraid my kernel coding 
skills are a
bit rusty at the moment. Sorry :-D
Cheers,
