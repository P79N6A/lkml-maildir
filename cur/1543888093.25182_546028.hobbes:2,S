    That's another thing I wanted to test, but I'm already using
"deadline" scheduler. How about changing "read_ahead_kb" to a much
higher value so there's plenty of data buffered? The problem seems to
be, according to Alan Cox, that my VIA mobo fills completely the PCI bus
when doing IO bursts, so I can take advantage of that "bug" and fill the
bus when reading.
    My only doubt is if it will affect performance negatively in other
usage patterns (e.g. while writing CD's, since the hard disk will take
the bus on each read operation, and will read more than the current 128
kB).
    Thanks a lot for your answer :)
