The only place where I can se it doing this legally is for structure
offsets.  For example where a "load 4 byte word" instruction takes an
offsetable address composed of a reg and an integer offset where the
integer offset must be a multiple of 4.
This rule we do abide by in the kernel, because PARISC requires this.
Anything more is asking for trouble, I wouldn't want to use such a compiler
in the real world :)
