It might be reasonable.  It is a little bit tricky, as if you're not
careful, this can open up security holes.  However, one course project
in a class I taught two years ago proposed a way to safely allow non-root
processes to use chroot().  Look here:

You might also be interested in the LSM project; in sandboxes like
SubDomain, Janus, SELinux, systrace, and the like; in privilege separation;
in OpenBSD's jail(); and similar topics.
