There is no need to sort anything in the kernel for acls except for the
NFSACL case, so that's where we need it, and nowhere else. What would be
the point in making setxattr accept unsorted acls? It's just not
necessary; userspace can do it just as well.

I don't know. Anyway, it's a nice feature to have a unique canonical
form.

Correct. But posix_acl_valid() does care about the i_id order as well.

Checking for duplicate e_id fields would become expensive. I really
don't see any benefit.
