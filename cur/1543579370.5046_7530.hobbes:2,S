Unfortunately, unix allows everything but "/" in filenames. This was
probably a mistake, as it makes it nearly impossible to augment the
namespace, but it is the reality.
Did you read the "new namespace" section of the paper?
It also talked a bit about supporting Extended Attributes, which are access
via an API and not with a filename separator. We could, perhaps, begin by
supporting EAs. That would take care of HFS, HPFS, XFS, and BeFS, and half
of NTFS. Then we could go on to tackle the Named Streams problem.
