This sounds like deja vu all over again.
Each new interconnect technology like ATM seems to go through the cycle:
	Assert: all other network protocols are crap
	Deny: history
	Assert: our problem is different, therefore we must
	        reinvent everything from data transfer up to 		applications
	Reality strikes!
	New technology ends up being used with standard applications and
	protocols.
