Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Andrew,
Here's rev 3 of the IOAT DCA patches that are currently in -mm.  These
patches include updates based on feedback on the previous sets, as well as a
couple of other fixes we found internally.  These were originally posted
on 20-Jul-2007 - see 
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=118489237427303&w=2
They apply to 2.6.23-rc4 and are targeted for merge into 2.6.24.
The following series implements support for providers and clients of
Direct Cache Access (DCA), a method for warming the cache in the correct
CPU before needing data.
ioat-new-device-ids.patch
	- add devices id's for newer Intel chipsets which support DMA and DCA
ioat-rename-source-file.patch
	- prepare for adding new functionality
ioat-dma-cleanups.patch
	- cleanup some code ugliness
ioat-split-startup-code.patch
	- split the DMA support code from the PCI startup
ioat-add-msi-msix-support.patch
	- add support for various interrupt handling schemes
ioat-add-dca-support.patch
	- add the dca driver
ioat-add-ioat-dca.patch
	- add DCA services to the ioatdma driver
