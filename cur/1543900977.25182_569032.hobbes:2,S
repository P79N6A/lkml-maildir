I think you had some additional change somewhere...
kbuild will only look for lib.a files (produced from all files
listed with lib-y _except_ files listed with obj-y too).
kbuild by default know about lib/ but almost all archs
add the directory: arch/$(ARCH)/lib but no-one
add mm/.
See assignment to libs-y.
Add see the bad documentation in Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.txt
