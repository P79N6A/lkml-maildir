Nobody claimed the committee was perfect. Shit happens.
There were also plenty of productive discussions.

If they never heard of the issue before they are unlikely to 
be useful in the discussion even after an hour of talk. That is not
how it works again.

Abstract of a discussion? Interesting concept.  Maybe.
If you mean abstract of a talk then I think you're wrong.
Not sure that abstract of a discussion thing would really work though.
It seems a bit contradicting in itself.
