Subject: VLAN startup info patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/5/25/104

Attached is a patch against the 2.4.26 802.1q vlan support header 
(kernel/linux/net/8021q/vlan.h) to make the startup info obey the "quiet" 
kernel parameter.
Currently, it will dump its copyright information even if the quiet parameter 
is specified... including an "all bugs added by" "buggyright" message, which 
tends to confuse some people when it is the only thing displayed durring 
boot.
