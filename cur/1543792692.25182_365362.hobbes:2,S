Subject: Re: [PATCH]: buddy allocator: ext3 failed to alloc with __GFP_NOFAIL

Hello,
as Andrey Savochkin pointed to me, the previous patch is incorrect since 
makes allocations with PF_MEMALLOC to be always success for order <= 3 
which is not what we usually want.
I remade the patch to be more explicit about the issue - now it retries 
allocation _only_ if __GFP_NOFAIL is set.
------------- original comment below ------------------
we had the following ext3 problems once during stress testing (on 2.6.8):

As it is seen from the messages journal_get_undo_access() failed to 
allocate some memory with jbd_kmalloc(), which in turn called kmalloc() 
with __GFP_NOFAIL flag.
How could it happen?
The only possible reason for this we suppose is a piece of code in 
__alloc_pages():
if ((p->flags & (PF_MEMALLOC | PF_MEMDIE)) && !in_interrupt()) {
         /* go through the zonelist yet again, ignoring mins */
         for (i = 0; zones[i] != NULL; i++) {
                 struct zone *z = zones[i];
                 page = buffered_rmqueue(z, order, gfp_mask);
                 if (page) {
                         zone_statistics(zonelist, z);
                         goto got_pg;
                 }
         }
         goto nopage;                <<<< HERE!!! FAIL...
}
So kswapd (which has PF_MEMALLOC flag) can fail to allocate memory even 
when it allocates it with __GFP_NOFAIL flag.

The attached patch should fix the problem (against 2.6.14).
