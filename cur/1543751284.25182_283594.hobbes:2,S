This is buggy, btw.  NFS has a "fun" deadlock where it can
send so many writes over the wire at once that the PF_MEMALLOC
allocations eat up all memory and there's no memory left to
receive ACKs from the NFS server ...
NFS will need to act congested when memory is low and there
are already some writeouts underway.
