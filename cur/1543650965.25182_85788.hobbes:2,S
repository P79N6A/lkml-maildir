Yes, and as a tangent, the same class of embedded devices also benefit
from TCP/IP offload facilities.  The same argument against a crypto-api
supporting crypto hardware has been used in the past to argue against
a Linux kernel TCP/IP hardware offload layer.  The argument is
completely invalid once one considers the typically lower speed of an
embedded processor going into a crypto or network-edge device.
Even better, synthesizable SoC designs like IBM PPC4xx and reconfigurable
processors architectures have opened further the concept of an on-chip
crypto or tcp/ip offload macro cell which virtually eliminates PCI
speed/latency concerns for these assist engines.  It should be no
surprise that embedded Linux is highly desired in these application
specific processors.
