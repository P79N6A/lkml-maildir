IMO that's bogus.  Correct test is "do we have any data in page cache
for this guy?" (combined with "... and if driver says that it goes
away, we'd better drop them all").  See the patch I've just sent to you
and Linus - right now I consider it as too dangerous for public testing, so...
Notice that it _doesn't_ trust check_media_change() - it still has
both detach_metadata() (needed in all cases) and truncate_inode_pages()
(kills cache, needed only for drivers with b0rken ->check_media_change())
in blkdev_put().  You'll need to make the latter call conditional to
actually keep the cache around, but I'd really like to make sure that
infrastructure changes are sane before doing that step.
