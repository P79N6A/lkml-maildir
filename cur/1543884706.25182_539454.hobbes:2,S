An model which doesn't scale well.

There is nothing here that cannot be done with a more complete model
for event handling.  It's Linus decision whether he wants to add yet
more code, yet more possible problems, yet more maintenance
overhead/nightmare for an interim solution which isn't necessary,
which cannot solve all the problems, and which is not as scalable as
other proposed methods.
I can only say that I would be trickly against it.  It makes just no sense.
