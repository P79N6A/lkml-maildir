The big difference is that if a tread running as SCHED_RR or SCHED_FIFO never 
sleeps normal treads (like X, sh, login, ...) will not be given ANY CPU time 
- computer will appear hanged.
[BTW you are not running the same code in both cases due to ifdefs...]
But it is possible to get out of this situation if you prepared for it 
before... Use a higher priority monitor to detect looping RT processes and 
reduce their priorities!
(I have code if you are interested, please CC me as I am not subscibed to 
linux-kernel)
