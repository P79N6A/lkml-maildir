This looks good; thanks. A couple of things:
- For the record, in order to register a device in the device tree, it 
must know it's parent and have a unique, non-NULL ->bus_id. (Unique only 
for the on which it resides).
For an iobus to be registered, it must have a unique, non-NULL bus_id. If 
possible, it should know its parent and self. If an iobus is an orphan, it 
gets adopted by the system root. If it doesn't know it's self, well it has 
identity problems, but nothing fatal. :)
- You're naming every usb iobus 'usb'. Is it possible for there to be more 
than one usb controller on the same bus?

Thanks for catching that. It's fixed in my tree. I have a couple of other 
changes pending with Linus, so I'm waiting for him to release -pre6 to 
sync before I send him anything else :)
