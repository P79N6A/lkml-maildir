hi!
please, look:
  thread A                          commit thread
                        	    if (jh->b_committed_data) {
                                	kfree(jh->b_committed_data);
                                        jh->b_committed_data = NULL;
                                    }
access for
b_committed_data == NULL ?
                                         if (jh->b_frozen_data) {
                                            jh->b_committed_data = jh->b_frozen_data;
                                            jh->b_frozen_data = NULL;
                                          }
or I miss something subtle here?

 SCT> Ah, but the *immediately* following lines are:
 SCT> 			if (jh->b_frozen_data) {
 jh-> b_committed_data = jh->b_frozen_data;
 jh-> b_frozen_data = NULL;
 SCT> 			}
 SCT> so the frozen data that was preserved at get_undo_access() time has now
 SCT> committed to disk and gets rotated into the b_committed_data version. 
 SCT> This is exactly how we get the new version of the committed data when
 SCT> the old transaction commits.
 SCT> Cheers,
