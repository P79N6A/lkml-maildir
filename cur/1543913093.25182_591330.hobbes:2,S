Honestly, rcutorture goes to some amazing lengths just to have this
randomizing-the-delays-that-read/write-test-threads-spend-inside-or-
outside-the-critical-sections thing :-) Especially, seeing that
synchro-test, the other "comparable" module, just doesn't bother with
all this at all. (especially check out its load == interval == do_sched
== 0 case! :-)
So IMHO, considering that rcutorture isn't a "serious" user of randomness
in the first place (of even a "fast-and-loose version" for that matter),
you could consider a solution where you gather all the randomness you need
at module_init time itself and save it somewhere, and then use it wherever
you're calling into rcu_random()->cpu_clock() [ or get_random_bytes() ]
in the current code. You could even make some trivial updates to those
random numbers after every RCU_RANDOM_REFRESH uses, like present.
Agreed, anybody running rcutorture isn't really looking for performance,
but why call get_random_bytes() or cpu_clock() (and the smp_processor_id()
+ irq_save/restore + export_symbol() that goes with it) when it isn't
_really_ "required" as such ...
Just a suggestion,
Satyam
