compiling the kernel is very CPU-intensive, about 95% of the time is spent
in user-space.
nevertheless the speedup does seem to show up:

an about 10% speedup for the kernel-only component. Considering that
compiling the kernel is doing mostly reads (well it writes object files
but the source is bigger, unless you compile with -g), and is accessing
files - this is not bad at all i think.
even for pure single-threaded cached writes the speedup is rather visible: 
2.2.10 (this is essentially 2.3.6 wrt. file IO)
 [root@moon fileben]# ./fileben FILE 60000 1 2 1
 WRITE: 150.27 MB/sec
2.3.8-pre2:
 [root@moon fileben]# ./fileben FILE 60000 1 2 1
 WRITE: 249.58 MB/sec
a 66% speedup. Of course it depends on the application - if the
application is purely doing reads then there will be no speedup, reads
were pretty much close to the physical limit in previous kernels already.
