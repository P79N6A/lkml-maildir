I've got an Abit BP6 with two Celeron 333A's running at 480 MHz on it.
(96 MHz busfreq x 5) I've still got a Celeron 300A around, so I'll
give it a try with a C300 and a C333.
I'll mail the results. I'm rather curious myself.

I doubt this is going to work...

Would be your best (and most expensive) option.

I've got a dual-pentium that uses cpu's with different spec numbers. NT
won't run on it, but Linux is very happy (and stable) and on it.
