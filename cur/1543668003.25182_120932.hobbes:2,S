Nope.
There is an ecc driver for RAM and you'll be able to detect these
using that.  RAM ECC errors in my experience don't cause MCEs, usually
the CPU never notices.

Dump the SPD and you can check...  usually the BIOS will tell you too.

Status: (9000000000000151) Restart IP valid.
*Exactly* what this means I don't know --- but I'm guessing the CPU is
overheating.  Check fans, air-flow, etc. and see if that helps.  So
far whenever I've seen the above problem it's *ALWAYS* been related to
the CPU getting too hot.
