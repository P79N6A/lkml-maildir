or you could keep two devices as backing store, use one and switch to the
other when the fs is consistent. This could as simple as noticing zero
dirty data in the ramdisk or, if something is constantly writing to it,
reacting periodically to some barrier (needs cow/doublebuffering in order
to not throttle the writer, but you already do this). Means ramdisk can
be as large as 1/2 the stable storage and a bit more i/o (resyncing after
switch to the other device), but gives you two copies of the data; one
stable and one that can be used to recover newer data should you need to.
