Hi,
I have an ARM hardware board works fine with USB and MMC in kernel 11. 
Now, I've just upgraded it to kernel 22. The modules seem loaded fine, 
please see following list, but both usb and mmc modules failed to detect 
the USB stick or SD card when it was plugged in (I enabled module debug, 
but nothing printed out). I understand that the devfs is no longer 
supported by the kernel 22, but should the modules still be able to 
detect the devices? I think something has been missing, could anyone 
help, what I am missing here?
K22 $ lsmod
