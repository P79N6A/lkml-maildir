Hi Michael,
I don't know if really a bug due to xmms, I suspect that's the case.  I'm 
not familiar with xmms internals, but when I gdb'ed the process after it 
froze, all the threads either stopped at poll(), write(), select(), or 
nanosleep().  Some combination of the blocking calls among those is probably 
causing the stall.  I highly doubt it's due to the kernel since I haven't 
been experiencing hangs in any other applications.  It could be the socket 
code though if extensive modifications to it have been made, since I've 
never experienced hangs like this in the 2.4.18 kernel used by RedHat 8.0.
