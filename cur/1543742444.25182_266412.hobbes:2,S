I don't have to.  It is very easy for me to take a copy of each of these 
and stick it in fs/ntfs/aops.c.  Works out of the box.  Just seems silly 
to proliferate code like that rather than to make use of existing 
functions...  Would you not agree?  If not, I will just copy the functions 
and that's that.

create_empty_buffers() which is already exported and used by pretty much 
all fs is just as generic sounding...  However renaming create_buffers() 
to alloc_page_buffers() might be better as it doesn't actually attach the 
buffers to the page.  You still need the __set_page_buffers() to do that.  
Perhaps you meant to rename __set_page_buffers() to attach_page_buffers()?
Its time for bed now but I will cook up a new patch tomorrow or Monday 
depending on when I get some time on the computer...
Cheers,
	Anton
