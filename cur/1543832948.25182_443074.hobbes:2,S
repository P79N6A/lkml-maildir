So what you're saying is that something like 'esd' *is* needed.  (It's
certainly silly to keep doing fork/exec for every little sound sample when
you can just leave the app running and hand it requests...)
Either ALSA is up to the task, or it isn't and needs a front-end program
to babysit it. It doesn't matter if the program trying to play the sound
is a window manager, or an e-mail program, or something else....
