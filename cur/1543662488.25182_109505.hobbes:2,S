Kernel 2.5.5x (have not tried earlier) and 2.5.60 's scsi/scsi.h do
not have like in 2.4 the 'include <features.h>', or as it may seem
to need an 'include <types.h>', and thus cdrtools for one do not
compile.
The take I get on this from Jorg is that he feels its a problem
kernel side.  Comments ?
Attached is a patch that get cdrtools-2.01a2 to compile.
