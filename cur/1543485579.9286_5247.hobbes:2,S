Hi All,
	Today when copying off my 4th LS120 disk the following happened:
Feb 12 16:38:26 Bytes4u automount[236]: attempting to mount entry
/mnt/automount/ls-120
Feb 12 16:38:29 Bytes4u kernel:  hdd: hdd1 hdd2 hdd3 hdd4

repeated until I killed the copy proccess.
I'm running a P133, 64MB ram, 2HDD, cdrom & ls-120 all ide, intel triton
2 (or is it 3). The ls120 drive is a panasonic.
This has happened before but I have never really taken much notice until
now. The weird thing is that the cdrom drv on the same channel
(ide1/master) works fine still.
Any Ideas?
