That's not the way the primary proponent of the patch is presenting it,
hence the clamor.
If it were instead presented as "this will prevent people from
accidentally frying their drives" then we'd say:
a) no one's done it by accident yet
b) the odds of doing it are negligible
c) it prevents legitimate things that root might want to do
d) the command filter code is about 50k
e) and touches lots of the driver
f) we're in a code freeze

That's already the case without the patch. Only someone with CAP_SYS_ADMIN
privs (namely root) can send raw commands. Arguably they should have
CAP_SYS_RAWIO as well and patches for that have been posted for both IDE
and SCSI.
