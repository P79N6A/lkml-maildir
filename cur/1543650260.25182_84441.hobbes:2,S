IMHO I find the ephttpd.c, once stripped of the tons of #ifdef to handle
the other interfaces, to be a very clear example about how to use the API
togheter with coroutines. Using it with an event driven state machine
would require a little bit more code, but nothing brutal ...
Anyway yes, the NOTES section of the man pages should be "enriched" with a
few notes and maybe code samples.
