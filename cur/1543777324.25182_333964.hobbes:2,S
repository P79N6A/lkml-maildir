Subject: [rfc patch 2/2] direct-io: remove address alignment check
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch relaxes the direct i/o alignment check so that user addresses
do not have to be a multiple of the device block size.
I've done some preliminary testing and it mostly works on an ext3
file system on a ide disk.  I have seen trouble when the user address
is on an odd byte boundary.  Sometimes the data is read back incorrectly
on read and sometimes I get these kernel error messages:
	hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x60
	hda: DMA timeout retry
	hda: timeout waiting for DMA
	hda: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
	ide: failed opcode was: unknown
	hda: drive not ready for command
Doing direct-io with user addresses on even, non-512 boundaries appears
to be working correctly.
Any additional testing and/or comments welcome.
