In this way, it's that the web servers themselves drop the privileges, 
not forced by sysadmin.  sys_promote is a new approach different from 
selinux or sudo.  sys_promote is manipulating a already running process, 
while selinux or sudo is for the next launching process.

sudo may become a security problem.  Sysadmin and the user don't like 
the user's account
always have priorities.  My sysadmin Hommel says this to me:

Alan is right, selinux can do things like that, but we don't want to
use selinux for only being able to "promote" root rights for some
simple job. To me it's more like a "one time sudo", and i consider it
generally useful on systems like zeus. Without the promote tool i'd
have to change some major parts in the system (implementing selinux
e.g.) or give permanent sudo/root permissions to a user.
