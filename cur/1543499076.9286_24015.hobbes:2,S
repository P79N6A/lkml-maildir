Hi there,
I hope it's appropriate to direct this in your direction :o)
I just compiled the 2.2.10 kernel with the same settings as I used for
the 2.2.9 kernel I've been using for the past couple of weeks. The new
system is about 5K smaller than the former.
When I run lilo after editing my lilo.conf file  I get the following
error:
[root@core /boot]# lilo
geo_comp_addr: Cylinder number is too big (1106 > 1023)
[root@core /boot]#
Changing lilo.conf back to use the 2.2.9 kernel removes the error.
My guess is that this has to do with the fact that my bood drive has
1245 cylinders, but I can't quite understand what issue exists for the
2.2.10 kernel which didn't exist for the 2.2.9 kernel. This is why
I have addressed this to you. I'm also looking at the lilo docs to
discover the specific cause of that error.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Paul Dorman.
