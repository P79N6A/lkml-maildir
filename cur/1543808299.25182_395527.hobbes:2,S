Hey Paul, welcome to the club, you're not alone :-)
Every time I use it, I spend more time fixing my mistakes
than doing useful work. I'm at the point of doing a "cp -a"
before starting anything because it too often gets very bad
after a few operations. Even git-reset often fails for me.
I think that the biggest problem is that it's not intuitive,
so if you don't use it often, it's hard to remember all the
tricks. Anyway, there are so many people happy with it that
I think that *we both* have mental defects. BTW, have you
tried cogito ? Not much more intuitive, but at least, it
reduces the number of commands for some basic operations,
and this sometimes leads to less mistakes.
