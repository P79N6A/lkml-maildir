 This is not going to happen with my other changes to the file applied.  
The reason is at the time phy_stop_interrupts() is called phy_stop() has 
already run and switched the state of the PHY being handled to PHY_HALTED.  
As a result any subsequent calls to phy_interrupt() that might have 
happened after phy_stop() have not scheduled calls to phy_change() for 
this PHY as will not any that may happen up until free_irq() have 
unregistered the interrupt for the PHY.

 Hmm, I am unsure if there is anything that would ensure flushing of the 
queue after its stop() call has finished and before a driver is removed 
(its module_exit() call is invoked), probably nothing, and that is why I 
put explicit flush_scheduled_work() in sb1250-mac.c:sbmac_remove() and the 
driver's open() call checks whether a possible previous instance of the 
structure used by phy_change() have not been freed yet.  There may be a 
cleaner way of doing it, but I will have to think about it.
