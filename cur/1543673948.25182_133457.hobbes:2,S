Too bad such changes don't go into the main 2.5 tree quickly enough for me
to see them when I look.
My changes reduce the hard-coding of so many address and offset constants,
and reduce the error-prone duplication and maintenance work by using the
i386 vsyscall.lds linker script directly.  You might want to incorporate that.
Thanks,
Roland
