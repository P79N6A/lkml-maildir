Replace the last sentence with "I am satisfied with the submitter's
response to my comments." or "The submitter has responded to my
comments in a way that satisfied my concerns."

(e) seems over-careful, especially since you're applying it only to
the Review-by tag, while all the other tags would also have the same
concern.
