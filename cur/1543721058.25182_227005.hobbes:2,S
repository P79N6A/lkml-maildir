I have the same chipset.

ah. Can you check the license in detail? See if it is distributable and
modifiable?

I was intending to strip out the raid stuff anyway, as the highpoint stuff is
binary and of no interest to me.

The highpoint one does. It would be useful to diff the shared bits.

Ah I never saw this. In their faq supermicro say there is only binary linux
support.
I have some time next week to look at this. If nothing else it would give
a reference for checking a libata driver. Can you check the license on your
