But you can be sure it's not going to happen, sorry.
It would mean that we'd need to export the entire TCP socket table so
then when iWARP connections are created you can search to make sure
there is not an existing full 4-tuple that is the same.
It is not just about local TCP ports.
iWARP needs to live in it's seperate little container and not
contaminate the rest of the networking, this is the deal.  Any
suggested such change which breaks that deal will be NACK'd by all of
the core networking developers.
