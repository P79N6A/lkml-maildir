Don't know what the problem can be, but as you seem interested in the
code, apart from the bonding driver in official kernels, there an
alternative (and more featureful) implementation here:
http://sf.net/projects/bonding/
It is a patch against recent 2.4.x kernels (lat 2.4.13). Apart from
traditional bonding/trunking (two or more cards give you aggregated
bandwith) it implements "link failover". Give it a try :)
