the problem is that this is not really a deterministic limit. The nr of
thread or open files limit is deterministic: it will either fail or
succeed at clone() or open() time - and can be freely used afterwards. The
kernel doesnt in fact know about the first use of a futex: no-contention
futexes have zero kernel footprint. This is the big plus of them. So i'd
really favor some sort of hashing method and no limits, that way the Linux
VM is extended and every VM address is waitable and wakable on - a pretty
powerful concept.
