Maybe this fix should go in now, and a thorough overview of legacy
workarounds done during the 2.7 development cycle.
Overall, what I'm thinking is that while it's generally a good idea to
keep workarounds for really ancient hardware, just in case somebody
does want to still use it, workarounds for buggy hardware that, for
example, only ever existed on ISA cards, are at best pointless on
systems which don't have any ISA slots, and at worst could cause
problems with future hardware.
John.
