The architecture mentions varying time base frequencies,
and how to deal with this, actually.  It makes no
recommendations one way or the other.
Fixed frequencies are easier for almost everything of
course :-)

Clock spreading on the core clock is the bigger problem,
lack of accuracy on the order of 1% is unacceptable for
certain applications.
