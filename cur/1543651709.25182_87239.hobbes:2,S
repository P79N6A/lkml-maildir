Hi Paul,
Fair comment,  however,  have you looked at a lot of the other files
in include/linux ?  Plenty of examples with the same lack of comments,
a good one that does essentially the same thing as flat.h:
	include/linux/elf.h
No excuses though,  here's a patch to add a comment about what the file is
used for,
Cheers,
Davidm
