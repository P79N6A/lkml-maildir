And that brings me to my crazy thought for the day.   System.map is
what is says, a map of the system.   Would it make any sense to compute
an md5 hash on it and use it as a means of verifying that the kernel is
clean from tampering?  (That's assuming that the hackers didn't replace
syscalls with a trojan with exactly the same size and same location.)
