Since i extended the /dev/epoll to manage pipe()s i noticed that rt
signals do not support pipe()s.
The mechanism of event notification fro /dev/epoll is perfectly compatible
with the one used by rt sigs.
Is anyone interested in pipe()s extension to rt sigs ?
The whole patch would be around 20-30 lines add.
