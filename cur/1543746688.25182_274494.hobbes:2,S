will take a look.

could you post the jack_test summary outputs?

how hard of a freeze is it? I.e. if you log in over the text console,
and do:
	chrt -f 99 -p `pidof 'IRQ 1'`
	chrt -f 99 -p $$
can you access the sysrq keys after the freeze happens? If not, can you 
access them if you do:
	echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/debug_direct_keyboard
? And finally, if the above experiments suggest that it's a hard lockup,
do you have a working NMI watchdog? (i.e. do the NMI counts in
/proc/interrupt increase on all CPUs?)
