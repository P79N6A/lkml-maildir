Shouldn't that option imply that all APIC related activity, including that relating to IO-APICs or PCI MSI, should be circumvented? I'm finding that MSI must be disabled separately, and while most of the IO-APIC stuff is indeed not happening, acpi_get_override_irq() only checks skip_ioapic_setup, but that doesn't normally set without the noapic command line option.
Is there any reason pci_no_msi() and disable_ioapic_setup() shouldn't be called when !cpu_has_apic at the end of identify_cpu()?
Thanks, Jan
