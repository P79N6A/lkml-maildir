You are missing the point though. Lots of these are part of our API, and
may be used at anytime. Lots of college kids are emailing me about
projects they are working on, and quite a few of them are using this API.
None of those projects will ever get out of the classroom, much less get
into the kernel mainline. But that API is needed, none-the-less, to expose
the internals of the system.
I'd hate to think that our "license" worries outweigh the small hacker
community for some projects.
