I don't even think it is the IDE drivers...And now I can't seem to find a
kernel that doesn't give me corruption if I try hard enough.  It might be
actually two different sources of corruption.
I talked with somebody else who said they were seeing corruption when
simply untarring the xfree 3.3.6 source, and so I tried it and was able
to also get the corruption _on one drive alone_ twice after trying about
200 times.  In both cases the corruption got recycled out of cache and I
wasn't able to see which sort of corruption it was.
Anyway, I don't think porting the IDE subsystem to different kernels will
help, because as I said before, 2.3.48pre4 plus the IDE patches that went
into 2.3.48 final didn't make 2.3.48pre4 seem to behave like 2.3.48, so
it must be something else in 2.3.48 that either causes additional
corruption or changes something that makes it easier to see the
corruption.
In any case, all of this seems to be SMP related.  That's about all I can
figure out at the moment. :)
