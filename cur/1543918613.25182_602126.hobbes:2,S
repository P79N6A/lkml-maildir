That would tend to be a tad racy - a site may want to set limits in the
hypothetical /sys/kernel/uids/NNN before the program has a chance to fork-bomb
or otherwise make it difficult to set a limitfrom within another userspace
process.  It's similar to why you want a process to be launched with all its
ulimit's set, rather than set them after the fork/exec happens...
