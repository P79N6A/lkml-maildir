Unlike inline __inline__ will be recogniced by gcc even in -ansi mode.
And inline is namespace pollution.  Where there's no technical reason I
prefer the non-underscore version, __inline__ is just looking too 1337
and eye-insulting.
Of course all these thoughts are useless because these days usespace is
not supposed to use kernel headers directly and the kernel isn't ANSI-clean
anyway.
