How exactly is this different from ptrace?
Seems just like a ptrace memcpy extension 
Is the patching really that time critical that you cant do it 
with normal ptrace?

This needs a limit.

Put the check into the normal notify_resume work mask, not adding
a separate check into this critical fast path.

This seems quite pointless since ptrace and can change all registers
in a child.
Didnt review more.
