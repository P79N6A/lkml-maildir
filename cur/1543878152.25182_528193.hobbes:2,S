not a stack trace but should explain the issue a bit:
...
ide_timer_expiry
	-> just before taking ide_lock IRQ happens
...
ide_intr
	-> completes the command and queues the next one
...
ide_timer_expiry (resumed)
	-> takes ide_lock
	-> the bug happens ;)
should be even easier to trigger it on SMP since ide_timer_expiry
may be running at the same time as ide_intr
