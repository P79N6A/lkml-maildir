I'm not trying to be rude to annyone, sorry if that is the impression
you got. I'm just looking at things realistically - the fact is that
moving to block layer tagging is not something that will benefit
Promise, so it'd be fairly low on their agenda of things to do. I don't
mean that in any rude sense, I can completely understand that position.
Why would you want to change something that works?  Hence it's
reasonable to assume that eg you or I would eventually have to convert
it.
No punishment intended.
