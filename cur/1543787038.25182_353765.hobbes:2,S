Think about why the kernel complains about a non-existant release
function.  Just replacing that complaint with a function that does
nothing does NOT solve the issue, it only makes the warning go away.
Please read up on how the lifetime rules work for devices, and what
needs to happen in the release function (hint, take a look at other
busses, like USB and PCI for examples of what needs to be done.)
thanks,
