Btw, I didn't see any ppc64 stuff in linux kernel. As a result this
platform is still in the unsupported status. :-)
Indeed a 4K page on a 64 bit machine looks very suboptimal. Note that it
is also way too small for 32 bits machines with hundreds of megabytes of
memory. I am wondering about the reasons that made us keep with so small a
page size. As you know earlier BSDs used 2K on Vaxen that as you also know
had (have?) a physical PAGE_SIZE of 512 bytes.
About the sym-2 driver, it may well be some pointers that make it need
more than 4K allocation on 64 bit machines.
I will try to make it fit a page size max allocation even on such weird
configuration, since I do consider as high^H^H^H^Hslightly broken any
piece of software that requires more that 1 PAGE of physically contiguous
allocation. :-) :-) :-)
To be serious, the right fix is to have some logical page be some power of
two of the physical page when the physical page is too small. Can we hope
Linux-2.5 to allow this?
