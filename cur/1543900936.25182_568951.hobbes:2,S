As does the current code; this is highly intentional behaviour since
there are machines (in particular a whole series of machines made by
Olivetti) which lock up if you do it differently.

Point.  "g" should be "ri".  I will send a patch.

OK, that would be a bug ported directly from the assembly version.  The
fact that the bug can be seen now is part of why I did this work.
Please feel free to submit a patch.

%ds?  Aren't you confusing it with the old bug which would destroy %bp?
 If you have any references to %ds being destroyed I would be very
surprised.  I can guarantee that very little if any assembly code I've
ever seen that deals with INT 10h -- and I've seen a lot of it -- guards
against %ds being randomly trashed.
However, the trashing of %bp is a well-known bug (although only for
machines older than the ones that can run Linux) -- the Interrupt List has:
BUGS:   some implementations (including the original IBM PC) have a bug
 	which destroys BP

That's a bug, although currently nonmanifest -- there are no users of
outl() at the present.  I will send a patch.

The "m" is correct right there.

There is such a file (arch/i386/boot/setup.elf) which is retained, for
exactly this reason.
