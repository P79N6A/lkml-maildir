If some one wants Linux server - I totally agree. I would probably even avoid relying purely on
generic IDE and instead use chipset specific variant or libata.
But if someone wants to access already installed & working other OS stuff - that's a different
story. Bad performance is still better than no support at all.

You are right here. I only see the possibility of int13 driver as some 'backup' plan for HW that
not yet have enough support via native drivers, or if someone wants occasional access and does not
want to upgrade to latest kernels for some reason.
