If /dev/dsp is closed, and all the input mixers are zeroed, and all the
outputs are at max volume...  there still isn't any sound.
So you can turn off the power.
[Cc to CD driver maintainers:]
It might be nice to add a notifier chain specifically for CD drivers to
say when they're playing something and when they're not.  Something very
simple: notify when audio playing starts, notify when audio playing
stops.  Perhaps volume changes too.
The CD/audio mixer interaction is very common, and with laptops we
really do want subsystems to shut down when not in use.
thanks,
