Might it be a problem with having two things using /dev/zero at the same
time?
What blocksize do you use with dd?
What happens if you do dd from /dev/zero to two different files on one
of the hds (with some filesystem on the drive obviously)?
How about:
dd if=/dev/zero bs=128k| tee >(dd of=/dev/disk1 bs=128k) | dd of=/dev/disk2 bs=128k
That seems pretty fast here (writing to two files in /tmp rather than
two disks since I don't have two disks I can just destroy.).
