That _usually_ just means that /sbin/modprobe is corrupt, or compiled with 
a binfmt that itself needs a module to load.
Are you 100% certain that you didn't just happen to put an /sbin/modprobe 
into your initramfs that happens to be a.out, with a.out being modular? Or 
something similarly silly?
Actually, with that "binfmt-0000", I guess the most likely thing is a 
corrupt /sbin/modprobe that isn't a valid binfmt format at all (but the 
kernel won't know the difference between a missing binfmt thing and an 
invalid one). It has bytes 2/3 being zero, which is neither ELF nor 
a.out, methinks.
BUT! If that's not it, doing a "git bisect" to figure out exactly what 
triggered it would be a wonderful idea..
