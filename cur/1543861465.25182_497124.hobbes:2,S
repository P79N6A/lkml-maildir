No. Hopefully "final -rc" before LCA, but I'll do the actual 2.6.20 
release afterwards. I don't want to have a merge window during LCA, as I 
and many others will all be out anyway. So it's much better to have LCA 
happen during the end of the stabilization phase when there's hopefully 
not a lot going on.
(Of course, often at the end of the stabilization phase there is all the 
"ok, what about regression XyZ?" panic)
