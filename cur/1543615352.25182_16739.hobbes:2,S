Have you looked at all of the code in question?  We're doing a lot of things
before we properly relocate ourself.  And as long as things aren't being
optimized away, it just works.
And the other thing is if we want gcc-3.0 to produce a good kernel on
PPC in 2.4.x, the kernel-side changes should be as minimal as possible.
