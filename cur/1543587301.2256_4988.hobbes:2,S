I would like to see this fixed as much as anyone (even complained to the
XFree people from SuSE last ALS).  But I don't think the fix should be in
the kernel.  XF4 needs to be fixed.  The problem doesn't just effect the
maxtroxfb, but also the vgacon video mode selection.
If I put anything other than "normal" or "extended" in the "vga=" line of
my lilo.conf the machine starts okay, but upon exiting X bad stuff
happens.  The screen doesn't just go black.  Probally the majority of
Matrox owners have multisync monitors, but I'm stuck with an old monosync,
and it looses sync when trying to return to a VESA text mode.
I don't use the matroxfb driver so this patch wouldn't help me, and is
also why I say XFree 4.0 needs to be fixed.
