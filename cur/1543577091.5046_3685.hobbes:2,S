Perhaps a deadlock with a normal (not irq) spinlock.
Could you enable SysRQ and press <Alt>+<SysRq>+<P> ("showPc")
Then write down the EIP values (including the [< >] brackets) and
translate them with ksymoops.
Ksymoops repeats only the EIP values.
But searching through the System.map file has only Labels from
the raid5 staff around.
As stated in my first mail I run actually my raid5 devices in degrated mode
and as I remenber there has been some raid5 stuff changed between 
test13p3 and newer kernels.
Hope this gives someone an idea?
Bye Otto
