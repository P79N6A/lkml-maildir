With the zerocopy patch, acenic always disables MWI by default.

I did some testing with starfire, and the results are inconclusive --
at least on my P-III is makes absolutely no difference. Does it make
a difference on other architectures? sparc64, ia64 maybe? 
I should probably rephrase this: MWI makes no difference on i386, but
it is claimed that using MWI *reduces* performance on some systems.
Are there any systems on which MWI *increases* performance?
I've added some code to the starfire driver that allows changing the
use of MWI at module load time, just in case. By default, it activates
it.
