Pretty much as bad as 29-1. Sadly i have no idea on how to find out what is
causing jackd to act so weird under a PREEMPT_REALTIME kernel. It seems
there is some correlation to activity on X. Hiding and showing windows has a
certain chance of triggering a large xrun.
Hmm, the max jitter rtc_wakeup shows at 1024hz is around 150us. Which seems
a tiny bit large, too, as the rtc histogram shows a max wakeup latency of
16us..
It seems it's not the threaded irq handlers as jackd peformed quite well
under 29-4 PREEMPT with the soundcrd irq handler threaded and at high prio
(which i forgot to mention in my previous mail).
So i don't really know how to go about this. I suppose i just run PREEMPT
kernels instead of PREEMPT_REALTIME. Maybe it's the overhead which is
killing jackd performance with PREEMPT_REALTIME, but i don't believe so
(50ms? nah!).
flo
P.S.: There's so many variables in this PREEMPT/PREEMPT_REALTIME, handlers
threaded/unthreaded. IRQ handler thread priorities. It would probably be
cool if we could create some testing procedure which produces results which
are comparable. Ideally this procedure would be automated. Any takers?
