Hi Peter,
	I don't have easy solution in mind either to meet both fairness
and latency goals in a acceptable way.
But I am puzzled at the max latency numbers you have provided below:

If it was just two active users, then max latency should be:
	latency to schedule user entity (~10ms?) +
	latency to schedule task within that user 
20-30 ms seems more reaonable max latency to expect in this scenario.
120ms seems abnormal, unless the user had large number of tasks.
On the same lines, I cant understand how we can be seeing 700ms latency
(below) unless we had: large number of active groups/users and large number of 
tasks within each group/user.

We will do some exhaustive testing with this approach. My main concern
with this is that it may compromise the level of isolation between two
groups (imagine one group does a fork-bomb and how it would affect
fairness for other groups).
