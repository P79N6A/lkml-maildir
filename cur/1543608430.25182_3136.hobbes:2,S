Only in 2.4.14pre6aa1: 10_nohighio-discontigmem-1

Only in 2.4.14pre6aa1: 10_vm-10
Only in 2.4.14pre7aa1: 10_vm-11
	Latest vm updates. Merged Linus changes in mainline, also the VM_LOCKED
	one on l-k that certainly make sense to avoid inactive cache pollution.
	Now keeping dirty swap cache around like pre7 does, dubious
	optimization though but I want to see if it makes big differences.
	Fixed three vm corruption bugs (one longstanding pre-2.4.9). Good
	that Linus spotted a silly vm corruption bug that I was adding in
	those updates :), thanks.
