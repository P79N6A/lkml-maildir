I'm seeing this same thing whenever kswapd and bdflush
are gobbling up CPU time at full speed without doing
anything useful.
At the moment I've only managed a really slight reduction
in the phenomenon by just not waking up bdflush when it
can't do any work.
The real solution probably will consist of some "everybody
wait on IO for a moment" thing which will take some time
to develop.  Stay on the lookout for patches on:
