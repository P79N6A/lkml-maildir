x86_64 benchmarks  where done on a:
vendor_id       : AuthenticAMD
cpu family      : 15
model           : 35
model name      : AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 4400+
stepping        : 2
cpu MHz         : 2200.000
cache size      : 1024 KB
SMP was disabled
x86 benchmarks where done on a:
vendor_id       : AuthenticAMD
cpu family      : 6
model           : 8
model name      : AMD Athlon(tm) XP 2400+
stepping        : 1
cpu MHz         : 1991.695

Sounds ok to me. It was the main reason to use these aliases. For me it also 
improves readability but as author my view is probably a bit distorted ;)
