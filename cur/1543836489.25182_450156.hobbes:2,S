Two reasons
#1	You should use cpu_relax in such loops
#2	The readl (which c4inmeml is a pointless #define of) is defined to be
a volatile reference itself
That means that the real bug would appear to be different and either you
have a gcc bug which is possible or you have something stranger going
on, such as the continued polling busying the microcontroller the other
end, in which case you need a delay not the lucky chance that mb() is
slowish on some x86 systems.
So you either want
		cpu_relax + other fixes
	or	udelay(something)
