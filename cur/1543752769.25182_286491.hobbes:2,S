36 bytes. BLOCK_MANAGEMENT_PAGES is not dependent on NR_CPUS.  It depends
on the number of objects in a block -- depends on the currency size and
the max obj size.  With current values, BLOCK_MANAGEMENT_PAGES is 9

Yes. Will change patch to do that.

Will fix this.

Yes. Will fix this too. This patch has been in the cans for quite some time
and for_each_cpu wasn't available when I coded this up...

Ok, I'll make a patch to move qsort to a common place like linux/lib 
and use it in the next iteration.  Just out of curiosity, is bubble 
sort unpopular or having two sort functions in the kernel source tree an
issue here?

Node local allocation. vmalloc cannot ensure pages for correspomding
cpus are node local.  Also, design goal was to allocate pages for 
cpu_possible cpus only.  With plain vmalloc, we will end up allocating 
pages for NR_CPUS.

Again, node local allocation will be difficult and also this means we 
allocate pages for !cpu_possible cpus too.
I am travelling (we have a long weekend here), I will mail the revised patch
early next week.  Thanks for the review comments.
