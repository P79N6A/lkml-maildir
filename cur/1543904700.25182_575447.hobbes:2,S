"Soon" in this case means, we NOW have a replacement driver and we aim at 
deprecating the IDE driver in its favour.

For example, into porting user space (replace hdx with sdx). And even 
switching to a "functionally identical" driver requires a new complete 
testing cycle... No, I won't be in that situation, so, it's not my money 
I'm worrying about. But I know there are companies for whom releasing a 
new version of /etc/fstab is a considerable expense... Not that I cared 
about them anyway.
Thanks
