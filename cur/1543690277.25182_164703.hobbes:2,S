No chance.  linux/irq.h describes one implementation which is suitable
for some archtectures.  However, there are cases where it just doesn't
fit the requirements, and architectures are then free to implement
whatever they want.
linux/irq.h is a badly placed header file - it should have been placed
in asm-generic.  It was never intended to be included by .c files, only
by asm-*/irq.h.
