These patches are all cleanups and minor fixes I found while iterating 
through each interrupt handler in the kernel, in pursuit of a related 
project.
So they can stand by themselves, and can integrate into whatever flow 
maintainers find most comfortable.
I'm not in any rush, but neither would I like them to sit forever...
