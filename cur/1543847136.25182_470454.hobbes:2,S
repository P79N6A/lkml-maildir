Agreed. Not recovering from an irq that hits the wrong cpu if we
can recover from it is a problem.   That part must be fixed.

I'm not trying to prove anything just saying that I tried.
All it shows is that there are an interesting subset of systems that
work.
The fact that the system that failed has a comparatively low volume
chipset from IBM let's me entertain my an atypical hardware hypothesis.

If it is inherently racy, (i.e. it cannot be fixed) I don't have a
problem removing the code.

(as an aside the problem does not appear on the irq migration path
 because the kernel has not made it far enough for that to be
 possible)
I think I don't understand the race you see.  I believe the premise
the irq migration code works under is that while an irq is pending
a second irq will not be sent from the ioapic.
If that premise is true, and we disable that irq on the ioapic,
while the irq is still pending that should successfully prevent
the hardware from sending any further instances of that irq while we
manipulate it's routing.
There are a few more details but that is why I think that path is
safe.

If the code is fundamentally unfixable the code must go.

The BUG_ON certainly is, I will work up a patch to get rid of that.
I'm hoping to understand how it could possibly happen before I fix
that now that I have a reproducer of that condition, because it may
influence the fix.  But dropping an irq on the floor is certainly
better then crashing the entire system.
