Subject: [ANN] POSIX timer patch for 2.4.0-test4

I have updated my POSIX timer patch to work with 2.4.0-test4.
These are the changes since the previous version:
* Added code to copy timer specific data in new
  copy_siginfo_to_user() function. 
* Removed extraneous shift (<<16) in __SI_CODE macro. 
* Added support for S390 architecture.
The test and library code has also been updated to be even more
paranoid. This was triggered by the bug in the __SI_CODE macro and the
recent changes in the copy_siginfo_to_user() function.
The kernel patch and auxiliary code can be found on my web
page:
