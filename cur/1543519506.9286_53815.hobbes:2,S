A good trick with __initdata is to have a bunch of data, and then copy
only what you need into dynamic kernel memory.  PCI names does this.
I want to do the same thing with code:  copy the code I want into
dynamic memory on a function-by-function basis.  Is there a preferred
method?
Presuming function dependencies are correct, a possible solution might
be to compile any code which might be dynamic copied with -fPIC, and
then set up the copy and call on that basis.  That is somewhat messy, I
am almost surely missing a more elegant solution.
If you are wondering "why", I want to drop all support code for chipsets
which are not detected by drive probe (which is substantial in some
cases).  Or in other words, have drivers re-link themselves at runtime,
freeing unwanted code  :)
Though I guess __init and this sort of hackery becomes less important in
a hot-plug device world.
Thanks much,
	Jeff
