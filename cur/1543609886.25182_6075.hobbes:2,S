Hoi,
since 2.4.14 kernel, after issuing 'halt', the Keyboard Power-ON or
Wake-On-LAN doesn't work anymore. I have to switch the machine on
with its Power Button.
With 2.4.13 kernel it works very well.
I'm using Asus P3B-F board with 440BX chipset.
Does ACPI use another State in Power Off since 2.4.14?
If so: How can I switch that back? - Preferred without an kernel
patch, maybe there is some config option like acpi_poweroff_state=Sx
or something like that?
PS: I'm not member on the linux-kernel@ list, so please CC me in
    replies, thanks.
regards,
   Mario
