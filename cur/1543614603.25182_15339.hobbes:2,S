Please, please dont add more confusion.. Fortunatly people how sell harddisk 
and bandwidth are both very consistent.
4Mbit bandwith IS always 4 x 10^9 bits per second
20GB harddrive IS always  20 x 10^20 bytes.
The confusion starts by saying a Mbit is only 1000 Kbit.. Well it is but the 
Kbit here is 1000bit/s
And a GB is only 1000,000 kB, but these kB is only 1000 bytes.
Dont confuse the matter anymore, I am sure someone does, but they are wrong!
