It depends highly on how you filter. It do not use To/Cc headers
to choose the mailbox to deliver a message in since that will not work
with things like bounces and aliases. Using headers like List-Id or
X-Mailing-List is reliable, but does not work with the duplicate
filtering you suggested.
It is a matter of choosing your own preference. And ours seem to differ.
