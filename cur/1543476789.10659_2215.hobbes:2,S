i thought i made that clear.. i do not run SMP kernels. i've tested them to
see the effect, but my primary system always runs a UP kernel because it's a
UP machine. here's some configure fun:
creating ./config.status
creating Makefile.conf
creating src/include/config.h
configure: warning: 
configure: warning: Your kernel is SMP
configure: warning: 
Configure finished. Do 'make' to compile Dosemu.

^^ my kernel is not SMP, but dosemu 0.99.6's configure reported that it was.

i'm using dosemu 0.99.6, kernel 2.2.0pre1 (i haven't had time to update to the
latest pre, but this *should* be recent enough)
also: while doing the build of 0.99.6, i recieved this error:
cc1: Invalid option `-fno-gcse'
make[2]: *** [hdinfo] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/dosemu-0.99.6/src/tools/periph'
make[1]: *** [tools/periph] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/dosemu-0.99.6/src'
make: *** [default] Error 2
nuklear [/usr/src/dosemu-0.99.6]# 
which doesn't seem right, because configure should have tested for it. my
compiler is:
gcc version egcs-2.90.29 980515 (egcs-1.0.3 release)
my system is a UP p166, glibc2.0.7, linux 2.2.0pre1
any help is appreciated :)
