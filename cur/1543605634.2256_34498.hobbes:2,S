Strange, that was exactly what I was planning for 2.5 :).

depmod, not modules_install, depmod is run at other times.

kbuild 2.5 does -DKBUILD_OBJECT=module_name for all objects linked into
a module.  KBUILD_OBJECT defines the overall module, not the individual
files that make up the module.  We have the technology!

Just another modules.* file, probably modules.dynamic.conf.
BTW, INSTALL_MOD_PATH is dead in kbuild 2.5, it is a configuration
option and is held in .config.

Everything is a device and can be handled by the hotplug project.  It
is really a cunning plan by David Brownell and Greg Kroah-Hartman to
own the entire device subsystem ;).

Please, no more 2.4 changes.  Let Linus get 2.4 stable, fork 2.5 so we
can break it on a daily basis then backport to 2.4 when it works.
