Rather than try to store (uid, namespace) on the filesystem, I like the
idea of doing something like
	mount --bind -o ro --uidswap 500,1001 --uidswap 501,0 /home /home
In other words, when you unshare the user namespace, nothing
filesystem-related changes unless you also unshare the fs-namespace and
set uid info on the vfsmount.  This is fully backward-compatible and
should have no overhead if you don't need the feature.
