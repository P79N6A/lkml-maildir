It is output like:
[  843.122782] usb 7-2: usbfs: USBDEVFS_CONTROL failed cmd newhidups rqt 161 rq 1 len 10 ret -110
[ 1292.121131] usb 7-2: usbfs: USBDEVFS_CONTROL failed cmd newhidups rqt 161 rq 1 len 10 ret -110
and about the nfs server temporarily not available. Please note that I
did not do the rmmod from a nfs mountpoint.
