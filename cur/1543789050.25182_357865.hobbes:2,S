Well, as far as I understood recently HRT patch is not what I exactly need. It provides just API for using in user space applications and I need to use High-Resolution timer in kernel (particulary in TCP/IP stack)...
therefore my problem now is to find suitable hi-res timer patch for use in 2.4 kernel...
and I would be pleased if you could recommend me something...
