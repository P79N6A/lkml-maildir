Hello,
I'm waving my arms frantically hoping to produce a device driver for a
PCI-card. I've been able to find three memory mapped (LSB=0) addresses in
BAR's 0, 2 and 3 (I've masked out the 4 LSB's etc...). Now, to use those,
which I assume are physical addresses, I assume I need to make them
virtual somehow, but what is "The Right Way"(TM) to do that? I've been
tempted to use vremap(), but I can't say it works (no bells'n'whistles
from the card), and the comments in the code don't exactly indicate that
this is the right use for them. I'm on 2.0.36, but I can choose whatever
makes my life easier.
Any advice eagerly consumed.
Thanks!!
