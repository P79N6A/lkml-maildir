OK, a bit of fiddling does indicate that if a file is present on both
client and server, and is modified on the client, the rsync client will
indeed touch the pagecache pages twice.  Does this describe the files which
you're copying at all?
One thing you could do is to run `watch -n1 cat /proc/meminfo'.  Cause lots
of memory to be freed up then do the copy.  Monitor the size of the active
and inactive lists.  If the active list is growing then we know that rsync
is touching pages twice.
That would be an unfortunate special-case.
