Hi,
does anyone know how to use the Media Vision (important!) Pro Audio Spectrum 16
with Linux ?
I tried using 2.3.38 sound driver.  the docs recommend for Media Vision card 
_not_ to use the ProAudio driver (pas2) but use it as plain SoundBlaster.
unfortuneately loadiung the sb driver failes with
        sb: dsp reset failed.
I just removed that test for dsp reset in the sources and then the sb driver
can be loaded, but playing music still doesn't work but only give
many nasty driver messages.
so I tried using the pas2 driver for ProAudio and this one works ok
EXCEPT for mixer functions -- I can't change the volume and by default
the volume is almost off :-((
any idea how to use this card with Linux, or how to change the volume
with pas2 driver for  that Media Vision card ?
thanks,
Harald
