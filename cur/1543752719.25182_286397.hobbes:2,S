Umm...  Not really - that's propagation of operations on VFS-*only* data
structures from one part of tree to another; I don't see how that's
related to layering.

I don't see how they are related, so anything towards stacking would be
a separate story, IMO...  I'm not sure whether it makes sense to put that
into the same cycle - depends on how much will be affected by each set
of patches and how well it will split into trivial widespread modifications
vs. heavy localized work...
IOW, no idea right now.

Heh.  "p-node" is a result of giving up on finding a better term than
"node in propagation graph" - no more, no less.  I doubt that it'll
survive to final edition - both as term and as something that would
have a corresponding in-core object...
