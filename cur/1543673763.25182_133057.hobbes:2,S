This a specious argument.  There are many ways one can configure a
kernel that will make it fail to boot or run user space properly.
There's no getting around knowing what it is your configuring in and
out.
Note that I set the default to Y.  I also agree that I could have been
more verbose in the help string.

All big machines, sure.  All small machines, it depends.  All the (user)
