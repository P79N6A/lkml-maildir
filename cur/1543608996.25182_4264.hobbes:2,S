     I`m sorry folks, i dont quite recall whether i poked lkml with that,
  but here it is:
	2.4.13, reiserfs
	i have a disk access _every_ 5 sec, unregarding the system load, 
    24x7x365, so i suppose while it doesnt hurts me, it hurts folks with power
    bound boxes...
        I must add that i `m experiencing this on -ac tree too, adn this is true
    as far as my memory goes... (in the kernel-version context i mean)
cheers, Samium Gromoff
