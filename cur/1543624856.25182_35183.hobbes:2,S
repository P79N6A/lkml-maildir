Not changing IV parameter type in 2.4 kernels is important. Break that in
2.5/2.6 kernels, but not in stable 2.4, ok? Older 2.4 kernels dont't have
loop_iv_t, and being able to compile _existing_ modules for them is
important. 512 byte IV is nothing new, you know that, and all sane systems
have used 512 byte IV for a long time already. So the 'block size IV' change
to '512 byte IV' is nothing new, but changing the parameter type is evil and
should be avoided for compatibility sake.

So the choice here is either break (or at least cause need to modify) all
other implementations or cryptoapi implementation.
Herbert, if this loop_iv_t type goes into mainline kernel, I will have to
reverse that on loop-AES patches for backward compatibility.
Dependency on above mentioned #define's/typedef on kernel include files is
silly, as cryptoapi can define them on any of its own include files.
