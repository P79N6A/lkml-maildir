So.... we don't know 0xffffffff's are getting into dev->saved_config_space[]?
Possibly we're saving the device's state when it is already partway or
fully through the suspend process, dunno.
What if you were to put code into pci_save_state() to detect when it reads
an oxffffffff?  Do a dump_stack() and print pci_dev->current_state and
->enable_cnt and various other things in there?
Or maybe we've done something in the wrong order which has affected our
ability to access this device.  Print the order in which devices are
getting suspended, let's see if we're taking down the bridge(s) in the
correct order.
