That also falls within my rule of "user visible symbols should not be
selected".
But... we already do something like this already and it doesn't take
a scattering of "select" to achieve.  Look at fs/partitions/Kconfig
as a good example.
You get offered "Advanced partition support" as the first question.
If you say "N", you get something reasonable for your platform.  If
you say "Y" you're free to choose whatever silly combination you
want, but with reasonable defaults offered.
That's something that a sprinking of select just can't do.
