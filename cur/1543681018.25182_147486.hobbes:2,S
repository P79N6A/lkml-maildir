I've had no response to my earlier post (Subject:  IDE driver:  CBLID 
revisited).
In comparing the driver to docs I have, I've noticed some things and 
have more to say about the VIA support, but I'm not much for sending 
e-mail to myself....
I posted to this list to begin with because I found nowhere else to take 
the issue.  It seems impossible to determine who's supposed to be 
maintaining the IDE driver these days.
