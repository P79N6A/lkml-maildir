No, it COWs it (the file is RW).
I believe do_wp_page will still attach an anon_vma to the vma, which
will make the pte discoverable via rmap.

Yeah of course that won't work, stupid...
The intent is to stop get_user_pages from proceeding with a write fault (and
subsequent COW) to readonly shared mappings, when force is set. I think it
can be done simply via get_user_pages(), which is what I should have done
to begin with.
