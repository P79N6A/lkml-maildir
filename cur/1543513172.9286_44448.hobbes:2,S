In addition to what others wrote I have yet another way to get these
results.  I have to point out that I use emacs in its default
configuration which renames files to their backup name and creates the
modified file under the original name.
Basically I use three directories for each version of Linux:
linux-2.x.orig, linux-2.x, build-2.x.  The orig dir contains the
untouched original Linux tree, linux-2.x is a file by file hardlink to
the orig files (cp -lr linux-2.x.orig linux-2.x).  build-2.x is then a
symlinked copy of linux-2.x (cp -sr /use/absolute/path/linux-2.x
build-2.x).
When I edit linux-2.x, the hardlinks are severed because of the backup
rename and therefore don't modify the orig tree (patch also works this
way).  build-2.x has to be created after you add new files to linux-2.x,
otherwise they would be missing.  The symlinks however won't get
severed like the hardlinks do so they always point to the current
sources.  Modify in linux-2.x, configure and make in build-2.x.
The hardlinked trees also have another advantage: if diff finds two
files pointing to the same inode, it knows they are identical and skips
them.  If you don't have changes all over the kernel, a diff only takes
a few seconds.  Don't forget to do make distclean or something similar
on the linux-2.x tree to remove the backup file, they'll end up in your
patch otherwise.
When updating the orig tree, make a current diff on your work, kill
linux-2.x and build-2.x, update/patch orig, copy hardlink linux-2.x,
apply your patch, copy symlink build-2.x.
