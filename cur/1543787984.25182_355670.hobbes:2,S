Apologies for the mailbomb of ancient patches yesterday; the git
installation on master.kernel.org was upgraded and one of the tools
which I was using (git-rev-tree) disappeared.
I've just updated the script which feeds the mailing list, and it ought
to be behaving itself again with this week's git tools. Until the next
time... :)
