For the sake of completeness I ran my large inbound FTP transfer test (details
in the "Writeout in recent kernels..." thread) on this release. Performance and
observed writeout behavior was essentially the same as for 2.4.17, both stock
and with -rmap11a. Transfer time was 6:56 and writeout was uneven. 2.4.13-ac7 is
still the winner by a significant margin.
Hmmm...
