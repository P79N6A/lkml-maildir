PageLRU() is not used in account_move() version (in mmotm queue)
patches/memcg-move-all-acccounts-to-parent-at-rmdir.patch removes that.
We're now testing patch [6/6] which does
 1. remove per-memcg-lru-lock
 2. use zone->lru_lock instead of that.
Then, maintenance of this memcontrol.c will be much easier.
After patch [6/6]. account_move does
  isolate_page(page);
	move to other cgroup
  putback_lru_page(page);
as other usual routine does.
