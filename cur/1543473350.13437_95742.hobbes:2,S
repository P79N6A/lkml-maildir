I've heard lots of reports re problems with APM and, as a result,
don't have that installed...

In my case, I need PCMCIA to get online, but I just did a network
install of RH5.2 and it set everything up for me. PCMCIA in regular
use, RH5.2 works fine under kernel-2.0.36-1.i386.rpm and no problems
that I've found so far...
Best wishes from Riley.
