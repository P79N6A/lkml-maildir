Unfortunately so :( Do you have any info on how close the FF 
implementation of the common FF devices is to the PID standard?
I had a poor choice of words in the previous message; I have only little 
code written, mainly I've been just thinking on a bunch of ideas on how 
we could do these things better (in other words, I've taken a summer break).
What I have written, is the PID driver (not complete yet) and a simple 
FF driver for Zeroplus based devices (VID 0x0c12, PID 0x0005 and 0x0008, 
very cheap Playstation-pads with USB connector, I have two branded "XFX 
Executioner Dual Impact" (BTW, their Windows driver is crap, doesn't 
support multiple devices and hangs Control Panel windows continuosly)). 
I could post a patch for the Zeroplus support, but with current FF 
driver model, that would be 90% copy-paste of hid-tmff.c & hid-lgff.c.

Ok.

Hmm, that wouldn't leave much stuff into the userspace library (Effect 
storage for devices without memory, converting effects with envelopes to 
magnitude+time -sequences for devices without envelope support, etc). 
Maybe we should implement everything in the kernel... I have to think 
about it, maybe something big that should be implemented in userspace 
comes to my mind.
