Ok,
I think this patch will fix the driver to find your TPM.  It is just
adding some additional LPC buses to look for so it won't make things any
worse if it doesn't fix the problem.  Please let me know if it works.
If it finds the device it should print a version message in syslog.
Also there should be a tpm0 directory in /sys/classs/misc.  Once you
have that you can try to cat /sys/class/misc/tpm0/device/pcrs.  If that
returns an error please try the next patch I send you and let me know
the results.
Thanks,
Kylie
