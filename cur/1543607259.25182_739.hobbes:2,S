We will definitely have initrd or initramfs to do this (initramfs is
using the initrd protocol to populate a ramfs from a tar/cpio image.)
However, when it comes up, it will be the root as far as the kernel is
concerned, and run /sbin/init (unless overridden on the kernel command
line, of course) like any other boot.  None of this change_root and
/linuxrc special casing garbage.
