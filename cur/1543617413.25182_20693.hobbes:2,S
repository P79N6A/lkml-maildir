I just tried it on my alpha (modifying the source to accept 2.70) and it
appears to work.  atleast I can make a partition, mke2fs it and put files on
it.  I keep getting ecc uncorrectable errors (retryable) frequently.  No,
this isn't DAC's fault because it happens even if I don't load the module. 
I'm assuming it's either 2.4.17 (I doubt it) or the fact I compiled it with
gcc 3.0.3   gcc 2.95.4 wouldn't compile dac960.c

I think I did.  Now if the ecc errors would go away, I'd be happy.  The
machine's crashed many times on my already.
Any ideas on compiling the DAC960 module w/o using gcc 3.0
