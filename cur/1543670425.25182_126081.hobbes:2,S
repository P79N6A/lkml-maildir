Make these be explicitly sized, and try to put the 64-bit members at the 
beginning to avoid alignment and structure packing problems. Ie something 
more like
	struct loop_info64 {
		u64	lo_device;
		u64	lo_rdevice;
		u64	lo_inode;
		u32	lo_number;
		...

Any reason to keep an "offset" as "int"? It should probably be "u64" as 
well.
If you call a structure "info64", make the fact that it's 64-bit
_explicit_. That way it will look and work the same on things like x86 and
x86-64, without the need to have translation layers for binary
compatibility.
We should literally have the rule that any user-visible data structures 
cannot use _any_ types other than u8/u16/u32/u64 (and _maybe_ the signed 
ones, if there is any real reason to).
