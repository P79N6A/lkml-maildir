I tried adding the IP address for {smtp,pop}.gmail.com directly to
my /etc/hosts, finally just substituted with the IP address itself in
pine (as suggested on that link), but couldn't connect. I should've
expected, with the evil NAT setup that I mentioned earlier ... all
boxes here have private addresses (only) assigned to them, and
connect to the outside world via a (squid/web) proxy ... Ick.
[The proxy does allow CONNECT so some hope is left still.]
Thanks for suggestions,
Satyam
