First, get a struct page behind the subject file system image. A good 
idea to get there is to use vmem_map, which allows have a 
discontiguous mem_map array in virtual storage. Then add the memory 
segment's address range to it. Sparsemem also helps, if vmem_map is 
not available.
Second, implement get_xip_page for this file system. This address 
space operation needs to be provided for all files that are supposed 
to be XIP. readpage(s)/writepage(s) should not be provided for these 
files, becuase they rely on using the page cache.
Third, use file operations from mm/filemap_xip.c.
so long,
Carsten
