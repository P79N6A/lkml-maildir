How about putting all the required info in a structure and then do
sizeof(struct) and reserve that much of memory at compile time for the
note. This will mean there are no hardcodings about the size of the note.
But I guess, one shall have to keep user space kexec-tools in sync to
create a PT_NOTE for that. May be exporting this info in header files to
user space might help.

That would make sense. In that case, makedumpfile can do some verification
on the exported data and scream if something is not right at kdump service
start time.

To me vmcoreinfo looks like a good name to begin with. As of today vmcore
is the only consumer of the info. We might have to migrate to a more generic
name down the line if consumers of the info pop-up.
