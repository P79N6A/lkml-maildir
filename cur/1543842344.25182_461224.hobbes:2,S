I've often wondered why we don't set the cache line size when we set the
bus master bit - ISTR when I read the PCI spec (2.1 or 2.2) it implied
that this should be set for bus master operations.
I've certainly seen PCI devices which can bus master and do have the
cache line size register but have the invalidate bit set forced to zero
in the command register.
Makes sense when you consider there are cache line considerations for
"memory read multiple" and "memory read line" bus commands in addition
to the "memory write and invalidate" bus command.
(Consider - if you use memory read line and haven't programmed the
cache line size, how does the master know how long a cache line is and
hence knows when to use this command?)
