I consider that a bug in mpg123. Examples for rate conversion have been
available for years, so fix mpg123.

I consider this a bug in the tools. I've been working with real-time
video on sgi IRIX machines, and they do a couple of things right:
- The hardware supports a limited set of video formats. Most high end
  stuff (Onyx+Sirius, Octane+DV, Onyx2+DIVO) only supports a couple of
  YUV or YUVA formats (in studios YUV422 or YUV422+A is the most used).
  Low end workstations (Indy, O2) supports some "consumer" formats like
  RGB or Y as well.
- There are a couple of libraries (vl, cl, dmedia, audio, audiofile)
  that allows you to do all kinds of manipulations in userland.
Fortunately sgi also recognises this, and they're porting their
libraries to Linux (see oss.sgi.com).

The original V4L API was *implemented* first on TV grabber cards, but
was certainy written with other video equipment in mind. I remember I
looked at the API with the sgi stuff in mind, and considered it quite
sane.
