Greetings Byron,
It just so happens that I extracted a test6 IKD diff [1] for someone
yesterday.  Among other things, IKD [2] contains a memory leak detector.
If you would like to give it a shot, drop me a line and I'll bless your
mailbox with 1 ea. 123k bzipped patch.

1. not official IKD until blessed by Andrea.
2. Integrated Kernel Debugging toolkit.
