There are some knobs.  There's the mlock call that disables
paging for whatever memory you want.  
xmms could easily stop skipping if it mlocks its own code
and data.  Running it at elevated priority might also
be a good idea, so cpu hogs don't starve it.
Both of these needs root pribileges, or at least a suid
binary.  (The priority stuff _can_ be done without extra
privileges by nicing every _other_ process instead.)

Sure.  Take a look at /proc/sys/vm/swappiness for example.
More stuff like this can be made - by those interested.
The original poster also fixed the problems by doing
swapoff -a ; swapon -a 
after quitting a memory hog.  That can be automated
with a little cron script that parses the output
of free or vmstat and do this trick whenever
free memory exceed the amount in swap.
