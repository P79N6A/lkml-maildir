I have to apoplogise here, as I promised to make an advanced-routing CBQ
howto a while ago but I havn't gotten around to more then a preface
(partially because some of the iproute2 syntax changed). :(
This has actually been preety determental to my time, as everytime I
mention CBQ or iproute on the list, I get 3-4 private help requests. I'd
save time if I got around to writing the darn doc.
