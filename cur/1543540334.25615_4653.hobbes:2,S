You still need to have the USER_HZ constant in kernel space, since it 
differs between architectures (it's 1024, for example, on Alpha.)  Thus:
#define USER_HZ 100		/* Architecture dependent */
#ifdef __KERNEL__
#define HZ CONFIG_HZ		/* What the kernel uses */
#else
#define HZ USER_HZ		/* What user space sees */
#endif
Another alternative is to simply get rid of all uses of HZ in the 
kernel, and replace it with either CONFIG_HZ or USER_HZ.  This has the 
additional benefit of giving a compiler error when not used properly.  Thus:
#define USER_HZ 100		/* Arch dependent */
#ifndef __KERNEL__
#define HZ USER_HZ
#endif
