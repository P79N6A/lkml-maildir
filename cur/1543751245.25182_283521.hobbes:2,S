I agree it sure would be safer but OTOH it may screwup performance by
waiting for unnecessary long times on fast stroage.
So it's ok for a test, but still it wouldn't be a final fix since the
timeout may be still too short in some case.
Waiting on one (or more) PG_writeback bitflags to go away should fix it
completely. This is how 2.4 throttles on the writeback I/O too of
course. How we choose which random page to pick may vary though.
