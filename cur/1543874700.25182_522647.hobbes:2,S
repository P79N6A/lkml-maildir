Subject: [PATCH 0/3] pfn_valid_within() HOLES_WITHIN_ZONES helper
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

The thought of having a helper for the holes within zones code
has come up on two different threads in the last couple of days.
So I took the pfn_valid_within() patch I had developed for the
linear reclaim series and pulled it forward to 2.6.21-rc4-mm1.
I have split it into a three patch series to better align with the
affected patch sets within -mm.
add-pfn_valid_within-helper-for-sub-MAX_ORDER-hole-detection --
  adds the base helper and utilises it within the buddy allocator,
anti-fragmentation-switch-over-to-pfn_valid_within() -- changes
  references within Mel Gormans anti-fragmentation patch series, and
lumpy-move-to-using-pfn_valid_within() -- changes references with
  my lumpy reclaim patch series.
