Well, for me anyway, the best way I have with understanding ones decisions
in their code design _is_ to start playing with the code.  Try it the way
you want and you might realize things don't work so well, and then you
might understand why Thomas did it his way.
There's several times where I thought I could write something better, and
after playing with it, the problems start to arise where I then become
"enlightened" by the decisions others have made.

I think what Ingo is saying, is to modify Thomas' code and show where it
is failing, instead of just talking about it.  You can ask "why" he did
something, but I think Thomas gave you enough in his answers.  If you are
still not satisfied, then that is the time to start playing with the code
and find the problems, fix them and show us that "yes" your way is better.
Don't just ask why Thomas did it one way without a patch that changes it
to show us why he shouldn't have.
