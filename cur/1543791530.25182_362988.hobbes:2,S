Yes, but that's a single change.

Again, mount --rbind is a single change.  And fsckloads of attach_mnt().
IOW, you are doing that on too low level.  Right ones:
	* graft_tree()
	* do_move_mount()
	* sys_pivot_root()
	* expire_mount() (BTW, again wrong namespace touched in your variant)
	* lazy one in umount_tree() (single update of event in do_umount(),
then touch ->mnt_namespace for each vfsmount - with shared-subtree it may
affect more than one namespace)
	* couple of extra places introduced by shared-subtree patchset
