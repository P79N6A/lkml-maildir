Ah, that explains it.

What I've got locally are a Motorola LoPEC and Motorola Sandpoint (both
with ns1655x UARTs) and an Embedded Planet RPXLite (MPC8xx with a
similar UART to the 8260 variant).  But I'm doing this with my
MontaVista hat on, so in the end I'm going to try and test it on
everything that's not a powermac/chrp (more or less).
