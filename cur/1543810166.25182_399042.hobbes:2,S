Minor dependency issue:
My compile failed with this..
   CC [M]  net/netfilter/xt_dccp.o
In file included from net/netfilter/xt_dccp.c:15:
include/linux/dccp.h:341:2: error: #error "At least one CCID must be built as 
the default"
make[2]: *** [net/netfilter/xt_dccp.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [net/netfilter] Error 2
make: *** [net] Error 2
[root@tornado linux-2.6-mm]#
[I have no idea what a CCID is]
But it was caused by this:
CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_DCCP=m
and maybe this below had an impact:
#
# DCCP Configuration (EXPERIMENTAL)
#
# CONFIG_IP_DCCP is not set
After unsetting the option to build the DCCP Netfilter module, I was able to 
compile through to completion.
