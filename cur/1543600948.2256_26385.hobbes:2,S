Hi Alan,
IBM bought us a couple of years ago and linux RCU is an IBM approved 
project. I am not sure I understand what exactly is needed for patent use 
grant for GPL, but whatever it is, I see absolutely no problem getting it done.
I would appreciate if you let me know what is needed for GPL.
Thanks
