Tried it. Doesn't change a thing. Means: I get about half the number of
warning messages, but that just corresponds to half the number of packets.
What helps a lot, but not to 100% (get bad keypresses anyway) is
totally deactivating the ACPI. Killing all processes that access /proc/acpi
seems again to help a bit.
And The number of Warnings seemingly increases with the labtop
temperature... In a really cold room I get nearly no warnings at all.
Jitter? Hardware, that is simply broken?
Anyway, --- with Dmitrys patches I get hardly ever little bad events, just
warnings --- and --- well... I can live with them,
	Gunter.

The best ways are the most straightforward ways.  When you're sitting around
scamming these things out, all kinds of James Bondian ideas come forth, but
when it gets down to the reality of it, the simplest and most straightforward
way is usually the best, and the way that attracts the least attention.
Also, pouring gasoline on the water and lighting it like James Bond doesn't
work either.... They tried it during Prohibition.
