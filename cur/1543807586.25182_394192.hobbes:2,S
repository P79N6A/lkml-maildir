That is a possibility.  However I want to break some eggs so that the
users are updated appropriately.  It is only by a strenuous act of
will that I don't change the type of pid,tgid,pgrp,session.
The size of the changes is much less important than being clear.
So for I want find_task_by_pid to be an absolute interface.

Well the parent doesn't much matter.  But the child must have a fresh
start on all the groups of processes.  As all other groupings known by
a pid are per pspace, so they can't cross that line.
