The problem is that 2.2 isn't being released.  2.2.0 is.  2.2 will last two
years, probably.
Besides, at least Linux users don't have to wait months for a service pack, and
don't have to reinstall it after every application. =)

Well, it has been released.  You can't put everything in the present tense, or it
sounds awkward.  "Releasing Linux kernel version 2.2.0"?  What do you suggest?
The reason the tenses are the way they are is that
(1) events, e.g., "Linux kernel released," are in the past tense because they did
happen.  They are not happening as we speak; they already happened.
(2) features, e.g., "Linux 2.2 supports...," are in the present tense because no
matter when you read this, Linux 2.2 supports it.  2.3 or 2.4 or 3.0 might
support other things, but 2.2 always supports what you read here.

72 isn't long enough for some of the URLs.  I've changed it to 75.

Traditionally, the acronym goes in the parenthesis.  Either way, both are there,
which is the important part.  The 256-bit encryption, though, is a good idea.
Done.

I have a better idea.  Check my latest draft. (Website:

No.  People want to see this as a feature.  I don't know quite why, but I've
gotten some pretty strong opinions about it.

Again, check the latest draft and tell me what you think.

I like this the way it is.  I have also avoided having a string of "Linux 2.2
provides" or "Linux 2.2 offers" prefixes.

Business users like buzzwords.  Computer with multiple processors can imply
message passing networks, which is significantly more trivial than SMP support.

I still like this.  Passive voice is not bad for a press release.  It adds a
detachment that makes it sound less biased.

Took out "Linux's."  Now, it's "Already legendary performance..."

We can't list everything in full detail.  That's where the millenium penguin
document comes in.  Holy Library, Batman!  I'm a press release, not an
encyclopedia!

I don't care if we credit Microsoft.  We already mention the name "Microsoft" in
the Vinod quote.  I'm content with the "Microsoft is a registered trademark...."
line.
> Don't ever use "modify". Why would anybody want to do that?
I like "modify," because it both "customize" and "fix" imply it.  One of the most
important features of Linux is the ability to fix it if there's a problem.  I
don't think we should be claiming that Linux is perfect, because it is not.  The
advantage to being Free Software, however, is that they have the source and can
fix it themselves if no one else does.

It's important.  I (and many others) feel very strongly about the information
contained in this paragraph.  It's (IMO) the most important feature of Linux.

We don't necessarily want to imply that SuSE is a different operating system than
RedHat, so I don't want to say "operating systems" without distribution.
> GNU (not fair),
Of course it is fair.  This paragraph is meant to clarify one of the biggest
misconceptions about Linux.
> the Alpha and UltraSPARC (huh?),
Why should I kill this?  It's important that users know that they can run it on
their hardware.
> the 386 (long gone),
Not where I worked...
> and "Titanic" (getting old).
Not everyone knows this, and so many people saw and loved the movie that they
will find it interesting that Linux helped in making it.  I didn't like Titanic,
but I appreciate the technology.
> Stick to the goal. This document has "designed by committee" all over it.

Who cares who designed it?  We are trying to satisfy a lot of people with this
very small document, so it makes sense that we can't please everyone.
Eventually, we're just going to have to go with something, but we can keep making
it better until then.
> You forgot IRC,
Yeah, where the hAx0rZ hang.  I know EFNET has a lot of good support groups, but
IRC has such a bad rep that we don't want to bother.
> "Ask Slashdot",
I love Slashdot, but the best way to put a prospective Linux newbie off is for
them to visit that site.  There are so many complete and utter trolls there that
90% of the posts are useless.  I'd rather they visit these sites on their own, so
we aren't implying that this is the best support available.
Mailing lists and USENET are still the best resources for Linux help, IMO.

"Cost-effective"? ugh... no thanks.  I took that out for a reason.  I think most
people know what a mailing list is, and virtually everyone has interacted with
usenet at one point or another.  What is an "Internet group"?  I can't in good
faith put that in there, because if I saw it, it would confuse me.

We can't even if we list the trademark?  Doesn't this come under fair use?

Done.

People can look at the "General" sites if they want, but more specific
information is available if they need it.  News people will just tear this apart,
anyway.

Yes.
