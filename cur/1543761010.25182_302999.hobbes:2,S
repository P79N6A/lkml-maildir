The 'remove the magic' observation is not a 'backdoor' to introduce new
fields 'for free'. So please dont mix the two things into one patch.

it may as well be cleaner to do the timer->base_running thing after all,
and to do this in __run_timers():
	timer->base = NULL;
	timer->base_running = base;
note that we cannot clear ->base_running in __run_timers() [we dont own
any access to the timer anymore, it may be kfree()d, etc.], so
del_timer_sync() has to make sure that the timer->base_running info is
not stale - it is a hint only. But it looks doable, and it should solve
the NUMA scalability problem.
