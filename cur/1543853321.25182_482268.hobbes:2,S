i don't have my laptop with me but the error message i get in syslog
is somewhere along the lines of (this is copied from the initial bug
report):
kernel: ATAPI device hdc:
kernel:   Error: Aborted command -- (Sense key=0x0b)
kernel:   (reserved error code) -- (asc=0x11, ascq=0x11)
kernel:   The failed "Read CD" packet command was: 
kernel:   "be 00 00 00 51 93 00 00 0d f8 00 00 00 00 00 00 "
kernel: hdc: packet command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
kernel: hdc: packet command error: error=0x30 { LastFailedSense=0x03 }
kernel: ide: failed opcode was: unknown
kernel: ATAPI device hdc:

kernel:   "be 00 00 00 51 9b 00 00 0d f8 00 00 00 00 00 00 "
and i assume cdparanoia has problems reading that particular sector
and then it retries and i get similar messages every 5 seconds.
sometimes it recovers from this, at other times it's just stuck there
trying to read the same sector over and over again.
but after i get this message the ripping speed is greatly reduced
until i eject/insert the cd. then the speed goes back to normal. it
doesn't matter if cdparanoia recovers, or if i start a new cdparanoia
process, only if i eject/insert the cd. does this make sense?
