Rik while you are looking at your reverse mapping code, I would like
to call to your attention the at least trippling of times for fork.  I
wouldn't be surprised if the reason your rmap vm handles things like
gcc -j better than the stock kernel is simply the reduced number of
processes, due to slower forking.  
Just my 2 cents so we don't forget the caveats of the reverse map
approach.
