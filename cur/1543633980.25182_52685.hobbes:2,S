Fair enough.

I agree it seems robust and there have been no complaints, although
there could always be changes to the interface.  Personally I'd like the
interfaces in 2.4/2.4-ac sooner rather than later too - I just want to
make sure we do not "etch it in stone" prematurely.

Heh I like BUG_ON :-)

I agree the changes are nonfunctional and thus not a big deal...but I
didn't see a point in pushing erroneous changes onto 2.4-ac, whether
they are in 2.5 or not.
Although now it is all a moot point - Linus merged the patch I posted
earlier with the 2.4-ac bits against 2.5... so now a diff of 2.4-ac and
2.5 will be proper. ;-)
