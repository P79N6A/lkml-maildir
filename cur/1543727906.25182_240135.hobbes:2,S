If things are that bad, why don't you just take the easy path and let _others_
implement the linux-glue to your app ? All you have to do is to specify an
interface which is completely at your will.
Then, if something does not work out, it's not your problem. You can then
always draw the Solaris card and say "look, it works under solaris. So you (the
glue-author) must have made some mistake."
