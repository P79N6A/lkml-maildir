See Matt Mackall's earlier post on correlation, excerpted at the end
of this message.  Basically, with two strings x and y, the entropy of
x alone or y alone is always greater than or equal to the entropy of x
xored with y.
entropy(x) >= entropy(x xor y)
entropy(y) >= entropy(x xor y)
If you have the goal of throwing away some information so that the
attacker can't guess the state of the pool (which I'm not entirely
sure I agree with), then it is better to throw away half the hash than
to xor the two halves together.

There's plenty of basis.  We have two goals:
1. Return as much random data as possible (maximize entropy).
2. Don't reveal the state of the entire pool.
Throwing away half the result is at least as good or better than
folding the result.  There is no way in which folding is better than
halving, and folding is demonstrably worse if SHA-1's output is
correlated across the two halves in any way (which is almost certainly
true).

From Matt Mackall:
Let's assume the simplest case of a two bit hash xy. "Patterns" here
are going to translate into a correlation between otherwise
well-distributed x and y. A perfectly uncorrelated system xy is going
to have two bits of entropy. A perfectly correlated (or
anti-correlated) system xy is going to have only 1 bit of entropy.
Now what happens when we fold these two bits together z=x^y? In the
uncorrelated case we end up with a well-distributed z. In the
correlated case, we end up with 0 or 1, that is z=x^x=0 or z=x^-x, and
we've eliminated any entropy we once had. If correlation is less than
100%, then we get somewhere between 0 and 1 bits of entropy, but
always less than if we just returned z=x or z=y. This argument
naturally scales up to larger variables x and y.
