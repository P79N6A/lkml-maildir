of course, and it should also be massively-threaded, LSB-compliant,
enterprise-ready, secure, cluster-aware, power-saving and self-healing. I
admit that there's still lots of work to be done, but there's just so many
hours in a day.

actually, on-the-fly O(log(N)) multiprocessor garbage collection is
already integrated into its high-end modular OO design.

the first small mystery to solve are certain perturbations in Alan
Turing's name. But, yes, it's definitely a goal of the PID allocator to be
an answer to all, but also for it to avoid infinite loops for every
possible input value, while yielding slightly more subtle output than the
numeric value of 42. Patch in a few minutes.
