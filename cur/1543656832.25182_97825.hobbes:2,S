Erm, what does the size of the drawing functions have to do with the
size of the pseudo palette.  The pseudo palette is only there to encode
the pixel values for the 16 console colours.
This means that a 64-bit pseudo palette would only be useful if you have
a graphics card that supports > 32bpp, otherwise a 32-bit pseudo palette
is perfectly adequate, even if you are using fb_writeq.
(note that fbcon doesn't support > 32bpp, so we will only ever look at
the first 32 bits, and having it be 64-bit would just be a needless
waste of space imho.)
