First, here's the described hang in action, on the Core2 Duo on a 1Gb
hub:
GMAC 1 Status/Control remains at 0x5010/0x1800 until module is removed.
Read/write buffer pointers are changing.  Full ethtool output in
http://www.robsims.com/sky2.netmon.log.gz
This machine was also having major throughput problems - 17 kB/s.
Rebooting brought it to ~ 20 MB/s.  Booting into a kernel with the
proprietary sk98lin kernel module showed ~ 80MB/s.  Finally, returning
to sky2 gave 117 MB/s.  Tests run using netcat, dd, /dev/zero, and
/dev/null, transmitting from the problem box to an e1000 via a Netgear
GS108.  No hangs were observed during the "load test."
I also had a hang on a Pentium 4 w/sky2, 100Mb/s hub.  I neglected to
try removing and re-inserting the module before rebooting.
GMAC 1
Status                       0xF004
Control                      0x1800
RAMbuffer pointers not moving, Read buffer Read pointer != Write pointer.

Thanks for looking at this.
