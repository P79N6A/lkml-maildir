While you're on the subject can I just clarify some details about the arrays. 
If a task doesn't use up it's full timeslice and goes back to sleep, it 
starts gaining bonus points which elevate it's interactivity in the eyes of 
the scheduler. When it wakes up again, it will always go onto the active 
array. While running, it's bonus points are being burnt off on a time basis. 
If it then uses up it's timeslice, depending on whether it is above or below 
a cuttoff (the delta) based on the level of interactivity of the task, the 
scheduler will decide to put it on the end of the active array again, or 
expire it. Thus tasks that never sleep are always below the interactive delta 
so each time they use up their timeslice they go onto the expired array. 
Tasks with enough bonus points can go back onto the active array if they 
haven't used up those bonus points.
As wli said, most of my tweaks just change what I do with the data given to me 
by the scheduler, and looks for patterns in the way processes run to choose 
what bonus to give each process. The rest is the same as the vanilla tree.
Lots more to say but that should make it clear enough for understanding.
