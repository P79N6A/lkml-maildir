AFAIK the problem was that TSC's got desynchronized and the
gettimeofday didn't produce monotonic dates at that.
You could make problem go away either by setting HZ=100 or compiling
without TSC support. (kerneloption notsc didn't have the effect).

I'm making mrtg graphs of
/sys/devices/pci0000\:00/0000\:00\:00.0/C2_cnt , and it looks like
-test9 is calling it at a rate of 1100Hz, compared to ~1000Hz on
previous (HZ=1000) kernels.
Of course these numbers are not under mutex and increased by both
processors.
With ntpd I'm getting following:
Nov  5 00:26:32 tienel ntpd[501]: time reset -7.151071 s
Nov  5 00:26:32 tienel ntpd[501]: synchronisation lost
Nov  5 00:41:35 tienel ntpd[501]: time reset -7.150284 s
Nov  5 00:41:35 tienel ntpd[501]: synchronisation lost
So drift is about 10min / 24h (unless I botched the math, it seems to
happen after a dose of modula-3)
