That doesn't apply here. You carry what you expect to need, plus some
spare; then, if you really have problems, you go and get a refund on
something non-critical. Killing one user process is not a
life-or-death situation - and it's not worth preventing the user
process ever starting, just to avoid the slight risk of it dying
later.
