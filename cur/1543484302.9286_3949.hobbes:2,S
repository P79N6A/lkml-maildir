The K6-2/300 do have another problem - they come in two variants, a normal 100 MHz
bus (AFR marking) one, and a 66 MHz bus (AFR66 marking) variant. The other has been
shipped in not-so-small quantity, and many people have used it as the 100 MHz part.
It doesn't work reliably on 100 MHz. That might be the problem you're seeing.
