This is indeed the case. To be sure I ran unixbench on rc3 and the just 
released 2.6.11 en the results were nearly identical. So the temperature 
increase does not seems to indicate that the CPU is doing more.

Then I have proabably been measuring it wrong from start. I will upgrade 
lm_sensors and try again.
Thanks,
