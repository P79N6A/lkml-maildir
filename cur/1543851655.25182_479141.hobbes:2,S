Well, i mean my efforts on fixing top makefile (something in mm tree
already), optimizing (Kbuild.include option checking without tmp
files), implementing (checking sources without building it) and along
with this 80, whitespace, tabifying as inevitable thing.
You've been cc'd on everything. After i started my linux development
from top makefile, i've tried to act on most kbuild related lkml
messages.
Thus i wanted to hear something from kbuild maintainer(s).
