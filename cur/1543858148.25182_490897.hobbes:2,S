I tried out the patch below, but with it applied, SCSI still issues
REPORT LUNS to the device.  It seems that sdev->type = -1 and bflags = 0
when scsi_get_device_flags is called because the type code is not set up
until scsi_add_lun, which is called later.  In any case, the check
doesn't work for me because the SATAPI GoVault reports itself as a
Direct Access device, not a CD-ROM.

Was there supposed to be more to this patch?
