sorry so you're already using tasklets in current code? I misunderstood
the current code then.

yes, I think 16 is too much, the softirq code should just retry 10
times, summing up to 160 callbacks. After you re-arm the tasklet the
first time, all other rearmed invocations should probably execute less
callbacks than 16.
it greatly depends on the number of times we retry a softirq before
giving up and offloading the work to ksoftirqd, that number is 10
currently (see MAX_SOFTIRQ_RESTART). The bigger that number, the less
callbacks you can execute per tasklet.
