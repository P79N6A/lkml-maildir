It's the average programmers who will be writing the device drivers.
After all, if they were good with hardware and software then Transmeta
has already hired them, so if they're good with hardware and don't
work for Transmeta then they have only average ability to write the
driver with.
I don't want to give free reign for merely average programmers to throw
exceptions outside their code.  Especially since last I knew C++ still
didn't force you to declare everything you throw...
