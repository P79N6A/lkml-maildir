1)	setsockopt(SO_SNDBUF,x);
	y=getsockopt(SO_SNDBUF);
now y=2*x
2) or
	x = get_wmem_default_with_sysctl();
	setsockopt(SO_SNDBUF,x);
Doesn't restore the original send buffer, it doubles the send buffer
size.
If we set the internal send buffers to 2* the user space number, then
should do that everywhere.
