The right way to do it involves synchronization between the kernel side 
io_getevents() and the userspace code pulling events out of the ring.  
Alan Cox suggested embedding a futex in the shared memory region, but I 
don't think anyone ever implemented that.

It's not accounted because it is irrelevant -- the memory used by the 
events is already accounted against the user's address space.  The actual 
number of aios in flight is clamped to the maximum number of requests 
that was specified and accounted against the global reservation.  The 
number of events in the ringbuffer can be larger, and that doesn't hurt 
anything.

That's probably the case.  Also, any changes in this area *must* correctly 
update the compat/incompat feature flags in the ring buffer header.  That 
has been missed in the past...
