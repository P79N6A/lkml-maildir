Subject: 2.6: CPU dependent inline in 8250 serial drivers

Hi Russell,
drivers/serial/8250.h in 2.6 contains the following:
<--  snip  -->
...
#if defined(__i386__) && (defined(CONFIG_M386) || defined(CONFIG_M486))
#define SERIAL_INLINE
#endif
  
#ifdef SERIAL_INLINE
#define _INLINE_ inline
#else
#define _INLINE_
#endif
...
<--  snip  -->
Why should these functions be inlined only for 386 and 486 CPUs but not 
for more recent CPUs or other architectures?
cu
Adrian
