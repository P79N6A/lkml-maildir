BTW things like network block device would benefit from ioctl's being
standartized, too. That way, I would be able to pass ioctls across
network and I would be able to create network char device and play
sounds over network over it :-).

PS: How many things would break if we forced ioctls to _always_ pass
struct foo {
	int len;
	char data[len];
} ?
