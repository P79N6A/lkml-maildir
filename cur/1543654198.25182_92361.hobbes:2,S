And they're totally irrelevant to this.

Your answer seems to indicate that you never compiled a Linux kernel in  
your life. Now, I do not believe that you really didn't, but if I were  
judging *only* from this reply, that conclusion would be inescapable.
Incidentally, I suspect his problems would mostly be solved by including  
the autoconfigurator into Kconfig - not quite what he envisioned, but  
probably a better solution.
Oh, and for the database - at least the LHD seems to be pretty close to  
his description.
Welcome to my killfile.
