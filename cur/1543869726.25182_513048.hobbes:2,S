By same argument, we should just give up the coredumping in kernel. It
is rarely tested, so someone will just get it wrong.
Remember: we are having people with huge apps, and therefore huge
coredumps. They want to hack a kernel in ugly way to make their dumps
smaller.
...but there's better solution for them, create (& debug) userland
coredumping library. No need to hack a kernel.
