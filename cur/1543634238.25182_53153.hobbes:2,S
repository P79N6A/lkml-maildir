After seeing various 'static inline', 'extern inline',
'inline' and '__inline__' in the kernel source, and
reading GCC's Inline subsection, it's still hard to
use them in a clear way:
1. what's the key difference between 'static' and
'extern' for inline? is there a rule to pick which one
during development(such as library or driver coding)
2. what's the difference between 'inline' and
'__inline__'?
I wish the answer were in FAQ but it's not.
Thanks a lot!
X.Xiao
