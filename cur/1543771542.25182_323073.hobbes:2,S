Nope, but there's a design:

Subject: Double free of initramfs
In all linker scripts we currently have something like this:
  __init_begin = .;
 ...
   . = ALIGN(4096);
  __initramfs_start = .;
  .init.ramfs : { *(.init.ramfs) }
  __initramfs_end = .;
  ...
  __init_end = .;
It seems all 25 linker scripts in the current bk tree are suffering from
this.  Which mean with CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD enabled first free_initrd_mem
may be called to free the initram disk and just a little later
free_initmem will try to free the entire range again, so either the
linker scripts would need fixing or free_initrd_mem has become obsolete.
