It relies on PCMCIA card services and daemons running the
scripts as they find and report cards being available, either at their
setup time or later. The ethernet scripts then do the standard configuration
like any other non PCMCIA card.
The script then runs the standard ifup script for that interface name. 
This also means standard GUI tools like linuxconf work for pcmcia cards,
and you can swap an ISA card for a PCMCIA ethernet card (or vice versa)
and your machine doesn't break.
Once we have USB ethernet support this kind of sharing will become important.
