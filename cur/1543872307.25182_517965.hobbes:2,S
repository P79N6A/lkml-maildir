I just dropped one (silly ?) idea and expected you made the hard work :)
Then just drop the fget_light() 'optimisation' and always take a reference 
(atomic on f_count) regardless of single-thread or not. Instead of dirtying 
f_light, just do the straightforward thing and be with it.
(that is : fget_light() = fget() = no more keeping fput_needed everywhere, and 
convoluted things in some dark sides of the kernel.
It will save some conditional branches and complexity, and you dont need this 
f_light thing.

Yes, you see how hard it is to get this right.
