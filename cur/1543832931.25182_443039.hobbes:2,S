AFAIK buffers for direct IO need to be *page* aligned. Use something
like:
    abuffer = memalign(getpagesize(), bufflen);
Or:
    abuffer = valloc(bufflen);
I guess you got away with it cause your 512 byte alignment happened to
align on a page, but you shouldn't count on that. However...

You should check the return value of pwrite(). It could very well be
that you get errors due to unaligned writes. IIRC the glibc memory
allocator can decide from what memory pool it allocates memory
depending on the request size. It could very well be that the alignment
changes with the size. Anyway, try to recreate the problem with a page
aligned buffer.
