Without knowing what the precise semantics are that is hard. Every
SFF_DMA case may not be supporting DMA depending upon the configuration
so it should probably be set by ata_pci_init_one for all the normal SFF
devices.
Thus I would say
- Drop every user of ata_pci_init_one from the patch
in ata_pci_init_one set it to SFF
in ata_pci_init_bmdma set it to SFF + DMA on success
and while we are at it this would nicely fix your TODO in
ata_pci_init_bmdma by testing the class when copying the modes over.
