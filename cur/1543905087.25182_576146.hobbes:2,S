Hi Meelis.
I took the time to investige this a bit. The relevant files in
this case (arch/alpha/MAkefile + boot/Makefile has not seen many changes
when browsing the git tree.
So I looked back a bit further in the bitkeeper based tree.
Before boot/Makefile were converted to kbuild style bootloader indeed
referenced $(LIBS). That was lost in the process.
So adding $(LIBS_Y) is the right thing to do.
The linker error you get is due to kasprintf uses kmalloc and
it gets pulled in when srm_printf uses vsprintf.
The fix is to split kasprintf out to a separate file to
avoid pulling in more stuff than necessary.
PS. I had trouble compiling objstrip and had to due a lot of ugly
hacks before it compiles. I assume it is a toolchain issue..
