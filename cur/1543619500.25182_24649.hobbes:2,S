I don't think skip lists differ from the balanced trees w.r.t cache
line footprint.

Whether there _is_ a (non-negligible) false sharing would be an open
question.

Yes. Skip list or (whatever) b-tree are sure to have less space
overhead in the worst case.  Therefore, I'd be curious to see
comparisons with the three pagecache implementations.  Note that in my
last patch you can do a drop-in replacement of the radix tree with a
skip list, since memory allocation issues are solved.
