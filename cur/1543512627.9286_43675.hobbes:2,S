Hello there,
When I try to connect to the net, I get this
error 
modprobe: unable to locate module char-major-108.
Anyone has an idea which module it is talkin about.
And is there a place where I can see what module has what alias
like ppp-compress-21 is for bsd_comp and so on... I mean on the web
or any place where it is documented.
And one more module in 2.3.20 which is harassing me is tty-ldisc-3 , due to
which I am unable to connect to the net. Any Idea what this is for ??
I am able to connect to the net using my backup 2.2.12 kernel.
Any help would be appreciated.
TIA
Regards
	Avenger
