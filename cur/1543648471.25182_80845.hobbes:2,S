Subject: [PATCH]:  Sanity checking for drives that claim to be LBA-48, but  aren't!
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi guys,
I had previously posted about a relatively new Seagate drive that had worked
prior to 2.4.19, but in 2.4.19 failed to identify it's geometry properly. 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=103253071519548&w=2
Upon investigation of this with Seagate, it turns out that the firmware
version in question is for CE (consumer electronics) use.  They have used
bit 10 of word 86 (0x56) of the IDENTIFY DEVICE information to indicate some
feature in their "AV streaming data transfer set".  This breaks ATA-7, which
says this bit indicates that the drive understands LBA-48 commands.  
The kernel sees this bit set, tries to use LBA-48 commands, and the drive
errors, complaining that it doesn't understand!  Meaning this drive is
unusable with the >=2.4.19 kernels.  I think at least one other person has
reported something very similar, IIRC with a very old Maxtor IDE drive.
Here is a patch that does some basic sanity checking.  If the drive has an
lba_capacity_2==0, and has the bit set claiming to be LBA-48, it ignores
this claim.
I think this should go into the kernel, but I don't have any LBA-48 kit to
check that I'm not breaking things for other people.  Hope this helps anyone
else scratching their heads with drives that used to work.
