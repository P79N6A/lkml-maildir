Ok ... so let me propose an entirely different solution.
No doubt it has some terrible flaw, but I'll just have to
await your replies to see what that is.
How about we have:
 1) Yet another text config file in /etc, this one containing
    lines having two fields:
	* a list of IRQs, and
	* a cpumask.
    This file would specify which CPUs should handle which IRQs.
 2) A utility that can be run, after changing the above file, 
    to poke the proper cpumask to each IRQ, as specified in
    the file.
(Obligatory "simple" marketing claim: the above requires no
kernel changes.)
What am I missing?
