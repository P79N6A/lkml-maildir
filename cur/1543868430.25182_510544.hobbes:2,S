Yes, if the container pointer becomes invalid, then consider the following
scenario
1. Use RCU, get a reference to the container
2. All tasks/mm's move to newer container (and the accounting information
    moves)
3. Container is RCU deleted
4. We still charge the older container that is going to be deleted soon
5. Release RCU
6. RCU garbage collects (callback runs)
We end up charging/uncharging a soon to be deleted container, that
is not good.
