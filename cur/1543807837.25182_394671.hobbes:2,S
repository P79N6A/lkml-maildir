One of the things that I noticed with adaptec's and ami's raid (and an old mylex
dac960 IIRC) is that you can create containers or partitions (which every
they call them) on a disk set.  I guess you can take 3 disks, create a raid5
using half the capcity of the 3 disks and a raid0 on the rest.  I'm not sure
about fakeraid controllers as I've never configured one.
