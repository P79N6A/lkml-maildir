Unofficial NVIDIA Driver 2.4.0 Patch - Friday Jan 05 08:58:54 2001 - Updated 
by Crusader
phantomlord pointed out in our comments that the Christian "phoenix" Zander 
has produced a patch for NVIDIA's Linux kernel driver for use in conjunction 
with the recently released 2.4.0 kernel (phoenix wrote this code for the 
2.4.0 prerelease, but the patch should work with the final kernel tree 
without issues). Please note that this is an unofficial (and unsupported) 
solution, and that NVIDIA will likely release a new official driver version 
for use with the 2.4.x series shortly.
