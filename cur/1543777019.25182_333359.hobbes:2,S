If you read the thread more closely you'll become aware that the static
table approach is not really practicle. There is no way to find out at
runtime what voltage variant of Dothan chip your machine has
(VID#A,VID#B,VID# or VID#D). I became aware of that myself after
creating a static table patch (which I can send you offlist if you wish
although you risk running your chip at the wrong voltage unless you know
which variant of Dothan chip your manufacturer has used).
