Thanks for your reply.
The reason for this is to store a CD image to be burnt simultaneously to 
multiple burners. The burners may not all be of the same speed (though 
currently are... 12x), and the number of them may increase. The simplest 
way to work around any potential for blazing fast coaster production (we 
figured) was to store the image in a RAM disk. This way we are not at the 
mercy of Linux disk caching (which may well be perfectly adequate for 
this purpose) nor does every instance of cdrecord have to have 
obnoxiously large buffers. 
This is just one application, and the relevant one to us, but I'm sure 
there are others (that are equally uncommon/unusual/useless? :).
Using a ramfs on a 2.4 kernel appears the way to go. This method works 
fine for our application and is more efficient than having one large 
chunk of memory allocated all the time whether used or not (not that 
we're particularly picky about efficiency with a Gig o' RAM machine). As 
I understand how the ramfs is used in 2.4, it grows/shrinks dynamically 
as needed.
