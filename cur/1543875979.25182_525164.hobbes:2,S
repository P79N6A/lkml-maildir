Not quite -- x86-64 did HPET long before i386; the only stuff cowed
was the character driver support code. But the core HPET code
was always totally different code streams. We never did the complicated 
pluggable clock code i386 did though -- i never quite saw the point of that
because there aren't that many timers there.
Of course it is already obsolete with clocksources now.
