I'm not sure who it is that doesn't consider anthologies a
derivative work.  The u.s. copyright office considers anthologies
and other compilations derivative works except when they involve
insufficient creative work to grant them copyright protection.

But it's probably not interesting to argue any further about the inner
workings of copyright law.  Pretty much everyone seems to agree on what
the right approach is, here.  The big issue seems to be stability of
linux during the transition.
The interesting topics, at this point, have to do with the details of
migrating such drivers out of the kernel.
