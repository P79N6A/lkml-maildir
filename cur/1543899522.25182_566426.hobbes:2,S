That was the case with the original driver as well bit instead of
rearming workqueue it was using rearming timer.

input-polldev uses a separate workqueue, not keventd, and so should not
suffer from other workqueue users loading keventd. But if entire box
is under stress then workqueue vs timer context does not matter much -
your daemon which is in userspace may not get to run in a timely manner
anyway.
However I am open to bumping up priority of ipolldevd a little.

I am curious why you can't use the current device, since the calibration
done in hdaps does not alter the scale but merely moves '0' point around.
And fuzz should only remove small jitters, not rapidly changing data
that you shoudl get when your box is falling.
However nothing stops you from generating events for the 2nd input
device from the same polling function that generates events for the
first device.

I have not seen anything in your mail that would warrant reverting
the patch.
