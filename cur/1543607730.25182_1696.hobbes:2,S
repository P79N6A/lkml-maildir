Damn! You're right. I broke that when I simplified the anti-race code
back in June and replaced the #ifdef CONFIG_SMP bits with plain
spinlocks. Unfortunately I didn't put back in a critcal line.
Cut-and-paste error without the paste :-(
OK, I've updated my both my trees. I'll feed this to Linus in my next
release.
