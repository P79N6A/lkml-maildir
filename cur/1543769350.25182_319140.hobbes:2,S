I agree.
And I think you're just adding to the case for removing mnt_namespace
entirely.  We'd still keep CLONE_NS, and users currently using
namespaces (in the normal ways) would see no difference.
mnt_namespace has these visible effects:
    - Prevents some tasks from mounting/umounting in a "foreign"
      namespace, even when they are granted access to the directory
      tree of the foreign namespace.
      It's not clear if the restriction is a useful security tool.
    - Causes every mount in a mount tree to be detached (independently),
      when last task associated with a namespace is destroyed.
And this invisible effect:
    - More concurrency than a global mount lock would have.
Is that all?  Are any of these effects important enough to keep?
