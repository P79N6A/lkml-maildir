I disagree, because the system call overhead takes more time than the
execution of a switch statement.
Let me illustrate with a small example of how I see the implementation in
the C library of clock_gettime().
Reading the i386 TSC probably takes less time than a system call. Or am I
dead wrong here, and is Linux way better than I thought?

static int tsc_gettime(struct timespec *current_time)
{
	static int once = 1;
	long long counter;
	if (once) {
		/* do setup of various stuff */
		/* like getting the resolution of the TSC */
		/* or mapping register to user space */
		once = 0;
	}
	counter = rdtsc();
	TSC_TO_TIMESPEC(counter, current_time);
	return 0;
}
int clock_gettime(clockid_t which_clock, struct timespec *current_time)
{
	switch (which_clock) {
		case CLOCK_TSC:
			return tsc_gettime(current_time);
		default:
			return sys_clock_gettime(which_clock,
					current_time);
	}
}
