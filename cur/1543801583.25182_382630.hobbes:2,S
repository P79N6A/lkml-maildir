Fixing the real problem in the routing code would be the real fix. 
The underlying problem of RCU and memory usage could be solved more
safely by making sure that the sleeping memory allocator path always
waits until at least one RCU cleanup has occurred after it fails an
allocation before it starts trying harder. That ought to also naturally
throttle memory consumers more in the situation which is the right
behaviour.
