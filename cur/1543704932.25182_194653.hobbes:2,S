Erm, that's a bad change to make.  There's nothing wrong with having
a PAGE_SHIFT of >20, and this code would still work ... but with your
change it's now undefined behaviour.  Please don't make this change.
(worked examples:
1. suppose we have a PAGE_SHIFT of 24 (16MB page size), the original
code shifts 32 left by 20 then right by 24, net result a right shift of
4 => 2.  Since any machine with a 16MB page size is going to have more
than 2 pages, we're fine.  the new code will shift 32 left by -4 which
is undefined.  bad.
2. suppose we have a PAGE_SHIFT of 26 (64MB page size), the original
code shifts right by 6, result 0.  Since the number of pages is > 0
(one hopes ;-), the test will also succeed as desired.
