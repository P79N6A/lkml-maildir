I suspect making memory reclamation less multithreaded (doing 
it in specialized threads only) would be actually a good thing.
I remember there were lots of races in the past with too many
memory reclaimers in parallel that were just papered over with
various hacks. Maybe doing it with less threads would make
this all a bit more controlled.
The question is just how many threads it would need and if
any of the existing threads can do the job.
Overall it sounds more like 2.7 material.
