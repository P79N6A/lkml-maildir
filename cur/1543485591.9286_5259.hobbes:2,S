  Hi, all. Version 9 of my msr patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
Some documentation is also available here.
The patch provides user space access to Model-Specific Registers (MSRs)
and Performance Monitoring Counters (PMCs) via device driver interfaces.
The patch also includes a crude page colouring algorithm (off by
default) and improvements for the MTRR interface.
This is against 2.2.0+devfs. Highlights of this release:
- Removed call to <mtrr_init> in init/main.c and replaced with
  architecture-specific setup calls
- Added printk() to <check_cx686_cpuid> if bits in capability mask
  restored
				Regards,
					Richard....
