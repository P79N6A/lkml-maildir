   One other solution I thought of would be to have an rx_bytes_wrap counter
   in the struct.
32-bit values aren't atomic either, what is the issue?
We don't use atomic_t ops on these counters so they aren't
guarenteed in any way right now even.  GCC is going to
output "incl MEM" or similar for net_stats->counter++, since
it lacks the 'lock;' prefix it is not atomic.
