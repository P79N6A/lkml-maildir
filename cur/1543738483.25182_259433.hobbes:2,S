 Hmm, any particular reason to keep the local APIC disabled by default?  
Most BIOS vendors keep it disabled just because it's easier to get stuff
set up this way -- with the APIC enabled you need to do the same steps to
program the 8259As as with the APIC disabled, plus program the APIC 
itself, which provides no gain to BIOS itself or to DOS, so why bother?
