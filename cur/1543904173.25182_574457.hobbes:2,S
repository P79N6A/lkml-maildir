You've mentioned this twice in this thread. If you're going to talk about this
you should characterize this more specifically because resource allocation is
a rather incomplete area in the Linux. Rebalancing is still an open research
problem the last time I looked.
Tong's previous trio patch is an attempt at resolving this using a generic
grouping mechanism and some constructive discussion should come of it.
