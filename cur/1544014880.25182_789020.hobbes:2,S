Correct or not is a matter of opinion, so let's not go there.  It
certainly is unexpected and also inefficient.  The alternative would be
to return two values, they key and a flag to indicate the end.

                                                ^^^^^^^^^^^ ;)

More efficient, certainly.  Half the tree walks are gone.  Let's do it.
Note, btw, that this changes effort from O(2n) to O(n), while the old
visitor is O(1) *).  That was the reason why I wrote it in the first
place.  If the code wasn't as horrible and hard to use, it would be a
clear winner.  Guess we'll have to keep both variants.
*) Or rather O(2n*log(n)), O(n*log(n)) and O(log(n)) respectively.
