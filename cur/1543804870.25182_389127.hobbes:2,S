Really? I had serious problems with mine hanging in earlier kernel revisions. 
I haven't seen a hang yet on 2.6.15, but that may be because I've not made it 
to a longer uptime because of the scsi leak. 
When I hang I get complaints about DMA timeouts / weird ATA port statuses as 
the last messages on my serial console. After that, not even SysRQ works.
Cheers,
Chase
