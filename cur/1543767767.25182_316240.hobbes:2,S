Indeed. `perfect' patches as attachments are fine. Maybe that's why some people
testified they never got complaints about their attached patches :-)
But as soon as you have to point out some comments, replying takes a lot more
time (save attachment, load it in editor, prepend every line with `> ', ...),
and may lead to maintainer burn-out.
