This is intentional.  For the purposes we talked about we should
be requesting cryptd(<driver name>), as otherwise you may end up
with someone else's AES algorithm as the base.

The priority shouldn't be an issue in our case since the AES-NI
algorithm should register itself as an ablkcipher with an even
higher priority.
