Not in my case, at least for 2.4.20-pre4.
At which kernels does the nopentium become obsolete?  Alan Cox mentioned some
confusion about this.  Obviously the latest ones, but does this extend as far
back as 2.4.19?
In order to close in on what changes are triggering this, I found the patch for
sched.c for -pre3 and ran that, and find that -pre3  is fine with or without
nopentium, so that narrows it to what was altered pre3 to pre4.
There was nothing obvious in Marcelo's log of changes, so I will trawl through
the diffs themselves tonight.
At the same time, I noticed that there seems to a fair bit of touchy
behaviour of AGP out there, so maybe what is proving fatal to me is the same as
the cause of flaky for others.
