Looking at the git log i understand the core patch got applied to ext4 tree with the comment
from Andreas. So may be we can apply this patch also.
commit 4d7bf11d649c72621ca31b8ea12b9c94af380e63
Andreas says:
    This patch is now treating timestamps with the high bit set as negative
    times (before Jan 1, 1970).  This means we lose 1/2 of the possible range
    of timestamps (lopping off 68 years before unix timestamp overflow -
    now only 30 years away :-) to handle the extremely rare case of setting
    timestamps into the distant past.
    If we are only interested in fixing the underflow case, we could just
    limit the values to 0 instead of storing negative values.  At worst this
    will skew the timestamp by a few hours for timezones in the far east
    (files would still show Jan 1, 1970 in "ls -l" output).
    That said, it seems 32-bit systems (mine at least) allow files to be set
    into the past (01/01/1907 works fine) so it seems this patch is bringing
    the x86_64 behaviour into sync with other kernels.
    On the plus side, we have a patch that is ready to add nanosecond timestamps
    to ext3 and as an added bonus adds 2 high bits to the on-disk timestamp so
    this extends the maximum date to 2242.
