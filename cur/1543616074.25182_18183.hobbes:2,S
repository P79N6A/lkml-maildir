Could you be more specific?  AFAIK, the ext2_fs.h file is also used by
e2fsprogs (which actually has its own, _more_ up-to-date version of this
file), but the _i.h and _sb.h files are for kernel use only.  They do not
have any relation to on-disk ext2 structs, so there would not really be
any point in referencing them from userspace.
Cheers, Andreas
