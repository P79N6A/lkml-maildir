Wait a second. invalidate_inode_pages() has no idea of range, right? Finding
all VMAs of shared mappings for given inode is not a big deal. Sure,
repeating it for each bloody page would be painful at extreme, but
"make sure that every access to address within _that_ VMA will result in
pagefault" looks like a reasonable operation. Basically, we have
two sides - pagecache and many VMAs. And loop over VMAs with per-VMA
operations sounds more reasonable than loop over pages. We _can_ block
pageins without messing with pages themselves (it starts with finding VMA,
after all) and we can block new shared mappings (not a big deal).
Comments? Basically, I propose per-VMA rw-semaphore taken on page-in for
read and on that "flush and make sure we'll reread" operation for write +
rw-sem on i_mmap_shared. We could even make invalidation work for less
than whole file, all we need for that is skipping the VMAs out of the
range. Ingo, Linus?
