Someone maybe it was Oleg? did an OK job to abstract out asm-offset
generation. I asked to have it rebased but never heard anything back.
I would like to get this generic approach in and then let lguest use it.
But I do not see this as a reason to hold back inclusion in -linus.
But could we please get rid of the "../../../" in the include....
