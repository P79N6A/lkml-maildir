Glad its working so well for people other than me...
I was getting lots of those messages as well.  Try increasing the TPL_NUM
define in sktr.h from 3 to 9.  I was able to do many megabytes of
transfers without getting any of those messages (actually, I have yet to
see one after increasing that value). 
Alan, if you get a chance, please increase that value in the sktr driver
for 2.2.13 (assuming you accepted my patch).  I'll send you a real patch
if its easier.
I have managed to get the speed up slightly, and it seems to have
reached its limit.  The fastest transfers I've gotten so far run at
exactly 1896.77 Kbytes/sec using FTP on a 3mb file to a win95 box using
the same card.  Bumping the MTU up to 8000 helps transfers immensly.  This
was all on a 16Mb ring, of course.
