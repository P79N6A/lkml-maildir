(Gerd Knorr cc'ed because 'git blame' says he last touched the line of code
I ended up touching - if this needs other cc:'s, will somebody who knows who
should review please add them?)

This gave the NVidia binary driver indigestion:
X:2772 conflicting cache attribute d0000000-d0006000 uncached<->default
While researching this one and adding some debugging printk's and dump_stack()s,
I found that this was caused by:
[    0.444051] reserve_mattr swapper:1  setting d0000000-d0500000 to default
[    0.444055] Pid: 1, comm: swapper Not tainted 2.6.24-rc8-mm1 #4

...
So the vesafb driver had decided to tag an even *larger* space as 'default'..
I'm *guessing* that in fact, this area should have been non-caching (since
it's the video memory for the card), but nothing cared/flagged before.
Pigheaded-and-probably-wrong brute-force fix that works on my laptop, but
somebody who actually understands the vesafb code should check that in fact
the space *should* be non-caching.
