hello anyone
i just install the 2.6.11.8 kernel to my SUSE 9.2 pro box and the 
problem is that then i open the GNOME i had a message that there is a 
floppy drive found and ask me if i want to configure it... the odd in 
this situation is that _I_don't_have_a_floppy_ to this pc...
in the details says that the device is available but not configured... 
what is going on?
can anyone help me?
thanks
christos
