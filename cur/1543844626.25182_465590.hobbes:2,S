IIRC ISC BIND named opens a socket for each IP it finds on the system. 
Presumeably in this way it "knows" implicitly the destination IP without 
using platform-specific recvfrom/whatever extensions and gets some 
additional parallelism in the stack on SMP systems.
Why it needs/wants the timestamps I've no idea, I don't think it gets 
them that way on all platforms.  I suppose the next time I do some named 
benchmarking I can try to take a closer look in the source.
