But the SMP system should do n-times  as many user<->kernel transitions
and so should still run into preemption points at a high speed: even
if each processor schedules less often.

If the latencies in question are process schedule latencies, then
improving runq operation is the obvious strategy.

I thought that we had had this conversation in another setting and you
had argued that cache bloat was absolutely critical path.
