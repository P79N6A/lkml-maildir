Not sure. What happens if someone writes a 1GB /tmp file on a 1GB node?
Christoph recently added some changes to the page allocator to 
try harder to get local memory to work around this problem, but
attacking it at the root might be better.
Perhaps one could do a "near" caching policy for big machines: e.g. 
if on a big Altix prefer to put it on a not too far away node, but
spread it out evenly. But it's not clear yet such complexity is needed.
