International crypto patch is misdesigned and broken, period. Block device
drivers are supposed handle varying transfer sizes, international crypto
patch doesn't. Loop device transfers are supposed to be re-entrant,
international crypto patch transfers are not. Summary: international crypto
patch will corrupt your data. Avoid using it.
If you don't want to play russian roulette with your data, you should
consider using loop-AES package. loop-AES announcement is here:
