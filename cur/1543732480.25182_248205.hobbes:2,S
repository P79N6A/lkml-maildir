do you have the NMI watchdog enabled? That could help us debugging this. 
Enabling the APIC/IO_APIC and using nmi_watchdog=1 would be the ideal
solution - if that doesnt work then nmi_watchdog=2 would be fine too,
but remove this code from arch/i386/kernel/nmi.c:
	if (nmi_watchdog == NMI_LOCAL_APIC)
		nmi_hz = 1;
(otherwise nmi_watchdog=2 would result in one NMI per second, not enough
to shed light on the above 2.8 msec latency.)
