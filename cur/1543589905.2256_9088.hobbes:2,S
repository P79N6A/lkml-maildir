	Sorry to have confused you. IB supports the notion of connection
over IPv6, not exactly TCP. I just interchanged TCP and notion of connection
provided by infiniband. Infiniband is a cluster of technologies like VI, IP,
etc. So i felt that we can take advantage of this to do networking. Because
the speed of IB ranges from 2.5Gbps to 30Gbps, even a slight overhead in
software will affect performance very badly.
