Eww syslogd really ought to use datagram mode. I didnt realise Linux still
didnt do this. Ok your syslogd has choked

That is the behaviour I would expect if syslogd had choked and wasnt accepting
new connections. Why is of course the interesting question. libc should be
timing out connect to syslogd though if it uses connection oriented mode
which libc are you using ?
