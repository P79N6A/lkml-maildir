Could anyone let me know where I can find a full list for bootup command
line parameters, such as mem=1G, etc? I'd like to boot a Hyper-threading
enabled kernel using only one processor on a dual-processor system.
Currently my solution is to physically unplug the secondary CPU.
Thanks for any suggestion
