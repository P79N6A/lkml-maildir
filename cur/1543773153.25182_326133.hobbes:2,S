I wouldn't the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters "very few",
and those all require (at least) three bytes.

Correct.

Wrong.  The first byte indicates the total size of the character, but
it also contains data, like this:
  0xxxxxxx
  110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
  1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
  11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
Refer to the Unicode standard, section 3.9 for the full details.

Let me clarify with an example.  The common Korean name Kim consists
of three ascii characters.  The Hangul spelling, ~, is encoded in
utf-8 using three bytes.  Even though a three-byte character was used,
the number of bytes is the same.
