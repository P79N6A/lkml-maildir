Hi, there was some discussion here in the past on the bugginess of the 
driver for the Broadcom 5702 Gb (10/100/1000) network cadrs (shipped 
mostly with Compaq/HP boxes as standard item). Is this still an issue or 
have the problems been resolved? Is this network card fully supported 
under Linux 2.4.x and 2.5.x?
Thank you,
Ognen
