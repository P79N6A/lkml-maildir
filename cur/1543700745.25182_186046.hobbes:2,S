Same for both.
gcc 2.95.3 20010315
glibc-2.2.5-34
perhaps, it's loadlin or linld problem, or fat32 problem. The difference
is lilo doesn't need _dos_ to boot.
I tried to replace ./arch/i386/boot/setup.S with the one from 2.4.24-pre1
and it seems to go further before it breaks.
What's next to debug this?
Thanks,
Jeff
