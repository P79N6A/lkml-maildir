Ah, it makes more sense now :-).  So, could I bodge 2.4 in to working
by modifying bootsect.S with something like this?
        movw    $disksizes+1, %si         # Force 18 sectors/track
probe_loop:
        lodsb
        cbtw                            # extend to word
        xchgw   %cx, %ax                # %cx = track and sector
        xorw    %dx, %dx                # drive 0, head 0
        movw    $0x0200, %bx            # address = 512, in INITSEG (%es = %cs)
        movw    $0x0201, %ax            # service 2, 1 sector
        int     $0x13
        movb    $0x03, %ah              # read cursor pos
        xorb    %bh, %bh
John.
