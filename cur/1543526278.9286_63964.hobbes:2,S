If you do a lot of "find-ing and grep-ing", you might want to
try some Perl scripts I wrote which make this much easier (and
more efficient).  Snarf it from:
http://linux.ucla.edu/~uzi/cgvg/cgvg-1.6.0.tar.gz
I wrote it as a quick hack for my searching through the kernel
code... and as a temporary solution until there's the desire
by many to do a real cscope (yes, I know about "cs"... do you
know it's license?  (Look at the packaged manpage)).
