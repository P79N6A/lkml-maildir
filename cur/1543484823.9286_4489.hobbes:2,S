AS I AM NOT A SUBSCRIBER TO linux-kernel, PLEASE CC YOUR RESPONSES TO MY
EMAIL ADDRESS (stevecoh@mcs.com) or I WILL NEVER SEE YOUR ANSWERS.
Thanks in advance.
I have a Mandrake 5.2 (== Redhat 5.2 + kde) system that I am trying to
upgrade to 2.2.  While I have some experience in kernel compilation with
2.0.xx, this is certainly bringing up some new issues.  While saner
heads have recommended I wait for a RedHat distribution, somehow I can't
quite resist.  And I am so close, yet so far from success.
I have carefully read the "Changes" file and tried to acquire the
prerequisites before beginning.  With the original config and
acquisitions, this is my present configuration:

- Util-linux             2.9g              2.8      (2.9.8 available in
rpm) 
Since I am still not running 2.2.1, I have not installed modutils
2.1.121 but it is available in the form of an rpm when I get 2.2.1
booted.  For reasons that will become clear, the same applies to
Util-linux 2.9.  I am unsure as to whether libc6 2.0.7pre6 is earlier or
later than 2.0.7 so I have not installed it, but I do have the source if
I need it.
The problem is this, and it manifests itself EVEN BEFORE I BUILD THE
2.2.1 KERNEL!
If I merely install Util-linux 2.9.8, while all seems to be well, once I
log off, I find that I can no longer log onto my 2.0.36 system.  I get
errors saying "undefined symbol __bzero", and login fails.  I am then
forced to boot via answering  "linux single" at the LILO prompt, at
which point I "upgrade" back to Util-linux 2.8 and then everything is
fine.  I am becoming rather proficient at this little dance. <grin>
With my system in that state, I build my kernel and move it up to boot
in the usual way, add an entry to lilo.conf
and then boot the new kernel having first installed modutils 2.1.121. 
Once again, in the boot sequence I see these same "undefined symbol
__bzero errors" and while the system boots, the module loading is
hosed.  So I "upgrade" back to modutils 2.1.85, reboot the 2.0.36 kernel
and that is where it stands.
It seems that this "__bzero" symbol not being found is at the root of it
all.  Can someone tell me where that should be coming from and what its
being missing indicates?  The only relevant package I haven't installed
is 2.0.7pre6 but I would like someone to answer whether 2.0.7 is newer
or older than the pre6 before I jump down that rathole.  If I do need to
compile the pre6 stuff, what configuration settings must I use?  The
only other possibility would seem to be the absence of libc5 5.4.46 but
John Niehof in his "Moving to kernel 2.2" pretty strongly confirms that
I don't need this.
Since the absence of __bzero bites me even under 2.0.36 when I uprade
util-linux, it seems like I must solve this before my new kernel can be
successfully installed.  
Someone, please help!
