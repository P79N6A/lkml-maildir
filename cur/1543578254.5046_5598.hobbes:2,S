I had no problems booting an AMD 386DX/40 with 32 megs of RAM.
I just dumped a bzImage (703K) to a floppy and it booted on that just
fine.
Kernel was built using egcs-1.1.2 from RH 6.2
If I build the same kernel on a RH7 system using gcc 2.96 (gcc-2.96-69)
the machine reboots after "Uncompressing Linux... Ok, boot the kernel" no
more text is printed.
.config is available on request.
