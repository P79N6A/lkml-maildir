He's got a bunch of stuff that's not strictly related in there and
stuff I've already dealt with (vprintk and the like) and stuff that's
still forthcoming (panic tweaks, etc.). I also leave in all the APIs
like dmesg, they just no longer do anything.

Haven't encountered this. I think it should be fine for any compiler
that can handle 2.6. This has been in -tiny for nearly a year and a
half and no one's complained.

Well in some sense 0 is the proper return but I suppose this could be
made to return 1. Small enough not break anything, big enough so that
things like the above get unstuck.
