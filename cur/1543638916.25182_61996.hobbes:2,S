I'm seeing weired errors with nfsctl():
This works:
nfsservctl(NFSCTL_EXPORT, "deneb.enyo.de", "/mnt/storage/2/backup/deneb/tmp", makedev(3, 66), ino 167772288, uid 65534, gid 65534) = 0
But a subsequent call fails:
nfsservctl(NFSCTL_EXPORT, "deneb.enyo.de", "/mnt/storage/2/backup/deneb", makedev(3, 66), ino 150995072, uid 65534, gid 65534) = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
I don't understand what makes the difference (the inode values are
correct).  This is kernel 2.4.18 with XFS support, and the directory
resides on an XFS file system.
Any ideas?
