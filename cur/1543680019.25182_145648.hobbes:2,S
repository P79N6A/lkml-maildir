Hello,
This problem is following me since I first played with 2.5 (around
2.5.52). Every now and then the XFS driver causes a Kernel oops. First I
thought this may be a normal issue because it's a development Kernel and
I ignored it because I hoped that this was a known issue and tracked
down one day. But yesterday I had 3-4 of these oops'es in a row and now
I gonna report this in hope to see it fixed really soon.
I compiled kmsgdump-2565.diff into the Kernel (with some minor tweaks)
and tried to force this issue for half a day and guess, as soon as it
comes to demonstration it doesn't happen but I bet my pants that this
problem will show up pretty soon anyways.
Ok I can't show you a full output but I wrote the last one down on
paper.
;-------------------------------
fs/xfs/pagebuf/page_buf.c:1288
Unknown command: 00000000
;-------------------------------
I am not sure for the second line if it should say 'unknown command' but
something like this. Sorry, I can't offer you more right now but better
this than nothing.
