Mark it as unused in unistd.h (like #232 for asm-i386), and implement it 
as sys_ni_syscall in the entry.S table. 
Al has already reminded me that it must be marked deprecated for a full 
version before it can be removed, but when/if it does, then that's what 
would happen until some lucky sucker took its place.
