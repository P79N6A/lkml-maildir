I think it can be used to fix the ugly "hack alert" in linux/init/main.c :
Instead of 
                / * HACK ALERT! ... */
                memory_start = console_init(memory_start,memory_end);
must be
                memory_start = debug_init(memory_start,memory_end);
This fix will allow to fix a some hacks in the kernel,
done because the console is initialized too early.
                            Best regards.
                                            Alexander.
