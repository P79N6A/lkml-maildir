The current rules work for things kept completely private to the  
kernel.  If we start exporting things into the guts of libc, we can  
expect that those guys have _also_ been using all sorts of double- 
underscore symbols in conflicting ways.

Yes, but it illustrates how a supposedly-innocuous double-underscore  
symbol actually conflicts with a GCC builtin, and that's just GCC!   
That's not including the massive "The Implementation" codebase that  
is GLIBC.

This is Hard(TM).  Take a look at the interdependent mess which is  
kernel.h, or sched.h.  Feel free to submit patches :-D  That's  
actually part of the reason why I'm trying this kabi/*.h bit.  I  
think that if I can pull out userspace-required struct definitions  
from the rest of the code, we'll notice that some of the header files  
don't need as many dependencies anymore and can be cleaned out a bit.
I've also been looking at GCC's "precompiled header" stuff.  I think  
that a single kabi.h file that includes all other kabi headers,  
precompiled to "kabi.h.gch", could potentially speed up a portion of  
the linux kernel build by removing a lot of text parsing.  I can't  
tell for sure till I've cleaned up more crap and done benchmarks, but  
I'm willing to give it a shot. :-D
Cheers,
