OK, you said "just" the top down. That's fine, I can agree with that.
Obviously if any of the implementation of the top down features hits
ugliness that needs refactoring, that refactoring has to go first.

I made a preliminary attempt to rebase the /proc hooks atop of your
work. I looked forward to being ready for if a patchset like this got
adopted to -mm to be able to hand that piece over :-).
The reason I didn't persue that to completion was I wasn't sure how I
would then submit it - relative to the -mm tree? I didn't want to
include your patches in my series.
It would be nice if someone could make a git branch on kernel.org for
each -mm release so it can be more easily imported to a git tree. Sure,
`stg import' might take a while for all 1,400 patches, but that's OK -
so long as Andrew's not waiting for it :-).

Well I see pids as just another virtualisable entity, but OK... if you
come up with anything I'm happy to rebase atop it.

Yes, hanging things off is the intention, but they are both starting
points, just from different perspectives.
