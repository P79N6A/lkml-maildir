Sooner rather than later, don't we need those 8 bytes to expand from
atomic_t to atomic64_t _count and _mapcount?  Not that we really need
all 64 bits of both, but I don't know how to work atomically with less.
(Why do I have this sneaking feeling that you're actually wanting
to stick something into the lower bits of page->virtual?)
