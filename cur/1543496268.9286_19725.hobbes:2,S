Is this one of the printers that requires a bi-directional printer
line? If so, you may wish to play with the sub options under the
various printer port selections:
 Q> General setup --->
 Q>    <*> Parallel port support
 Q>        <*> PC style hardware
 Q>        [ ] Support foreign hardware
 Q> Plug and Play support --->
 Q>    [*] Plug and play support
 Q>        <M> Auto probe for parallel devices
 Q> Block devices --->
 Q>    <M> Parallel port IDE device support
 Q>        <M> (Assorted ParIDE options)
 Q> SCSI support --->
 Q>    SCSI low level drivers --->
 Q>        <M> IOMEGA parallel port (ppa - older drives)
 Q>        <M> IOMEGA parallel port (imm - newer drives)
 Q>            [ ] Use slow (but safe) EPP-16
 Q>            [ ] Assume slow parport control register
 Q> Character devices --->
 Q>    <M> Parallel printer support
 Q>        [*] Support IEEE1284 status readback
To be honest, there's enough there for the parallel port to qualify as
a separate subsystem in its own right, with its own configuration
section. I'd assume the reason this isn't done is because of the
number of other subsystems that impact on it.

A friend of mine has a zip drive with an old Epson FX80 printer that
works fine, but when she plugged her new Epson Stylus in the passthru
instead, that didn't work. I would therefore tend to suspect that the
more modern printers are doing something that the older ones aren't,
probably sending status info back to the computer and refusing to
continue until it's acknowledged...

I can't advise on that as I've not been in the position to try it
out myself recently, sorry.

That's worrying...
Best wishes from Riley.
