atomic.h : standardizing atomic primitives
It mainly adds support for missing 64 bits cmpxchg and 64 bits atomic add
unless. Therefore, principally 64 bits architectures are targeted by these
patches. It also adds the complete list of atomic operations on the atomic_long
type.
These patches compile fine against :
arm
i686
ia64
m68k
mips
mipsel
x86_64
ppc 405
powerpc 970
s390
sparc
sparc64
I haven't built cross-compilers for other architectures yet.
These patches apply on 2.6.20
