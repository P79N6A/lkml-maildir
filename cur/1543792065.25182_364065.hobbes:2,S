We patched our driver with the comments sent, but we still don't know 
what to do with this 2 points :
- For the license stuff, all the dual bsd/gpl drivers I saw in the 
kernel tree have the complete bsd header.
- For the header file I prefer a separate header file, but if Linux 
policy is to merge header and source file, that's fine.
