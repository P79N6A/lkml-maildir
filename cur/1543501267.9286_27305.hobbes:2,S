Sorry to reply to my own e-mail but it just occured that the part below is 
nonsense.. the "open_stat" call just simulates directory lookup..
So instead of fussing with file forks we could say that each file has
two properties: a data holder (whatever data that is) and directory
property. However this is nothing new.. Midnight comander operates in this
fashion. (and all ideas taken to a high enough level of abstraction are
trivial) So the question boils down to how efficiently implement support
for this in the filesystem layer which you, folks, were actually
discussing. Thus my only comment is that breaking stuff is ok (it's broken
now).
