Unfortunately, busybox mount is not very verbose. You get the above
mentioned error message even if the device file doesn't exist...
You should check:
* Is the driver for your MMC actually loaded?
* Did it initialize correctly? Does it find your MMC card?
* Is support for the file system on the MMC in your kernel?
* /dev/mmcblk0p0 and /mnt/mmc really exist? (sorry, but...)
Check the output of dmesg for messages from the mmc driver.
