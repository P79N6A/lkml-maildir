Jesper, I have no idea what I'm doing. :-) I simply adapted the 2.4
patch for 2.6.10 kernel.
Ideally, motherboard should support booting from USB key drive directly.
I'm told that most modern motherboards do support usbboot, but my
machine doesn't.  So, I trying to load the kernel from floppy (harddisk
for testing purpose).  This is part of my attempt to build Linux
thin-client out of mini-ITX type of computer (Via CLE266 chipset, Via C3
cpu).
Now, I need to find a machine that actually can do usbboot...
