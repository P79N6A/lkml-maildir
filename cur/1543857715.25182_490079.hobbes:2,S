I would have preferred that approach (with a WARN_ON rather than a BUG
though). On the other hand that would make it slightly harder for the
few cases (if any ?) who actually want something like a "create if it
doesn't exist already" semantic.
I'm a bit worried by the amount of code added by systematic checking of
the results for cases that really should never happen. That's why I
prefer a BUG/WARN type semantic.
Maybe the best is to have the examples like radeonfb actually do the
WARN_ON(sysfs_create_file(...));
Ben.
