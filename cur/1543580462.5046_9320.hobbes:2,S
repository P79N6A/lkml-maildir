Hi,
to make the tracking of our bugs and feature requests easier
I have opened a Bugzilla repository for the Linux-MM subsystem.
If you think you have new Linux MM bugs or want a new feature,
feel free to enter something in the bugzilla.
The information page about this bugzilla can be found here:
	
http://www.linux.eu.org/Linux-MM/bugzilla.shtml
People wanting to see what's happening but don't want to
look up the bugzilla page every day can subscribe to the
linux-mm-bugs mailing list, where all bugzilla traffic
will be sent.
To subscribe, send email to majordomo@nl.linux.org, with
the text "subscribe linux-mm-bugs" in the body of the message.
regards,
Rik
