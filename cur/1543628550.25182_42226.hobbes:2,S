I remain unconvinced. Firstly the timer changes do not have to 
occur at schedule rate unless your implementaiton is incredibly naiive.
Secondly for the specfic schedule case done that way, it would be even more
naiive to use the standard timer api over a single compare to getthe
timer list versus schedule clock.
