Just use a different dummy register, like 0x80 which is normally used
for delaying IO (I think that is what the dummy access does) 
But I'm pretty sure this NMI handling is incorrect anyways, its
use of bits doesn't match what the datasheets say of modern x86
chipsets say. Perhaps it would be best to just get rid of 
that legacy register twiddling completely.
I will also remove it from x86-64.
