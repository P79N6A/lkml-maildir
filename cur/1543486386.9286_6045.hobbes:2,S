on SMP, there is not only one timer, but one timer per CPU. This is done
through the local-APIC timer. So you get periodic interrupt on every CPU,
every 10 msecs. The 'old' timer interrupt is active too, but it only does
generic timekeeping and timer-function running. (jiffies, time adjustment,
etc.). In 2.3 we definitely want to distribute timers between CPUs, this
is not hard at all.

yep, it's done via smp_send_reschedule(cpu). Whenever we think another CPU
should be interrupted, we send a message.
