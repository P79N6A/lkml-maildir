Actually, do it with
	make -j3 'MAKE=make -j3' bzImage
A single "-j3" won't do much. It will only build three directories at a
time, and you'll never see much load. But doing it recursively means that
you'll build three at a time all the way out to the leaf directories, and
you should see loads up to 20+, and much more memory pressure too.
