Yay! I've found it. What seems to be happening is the PIC is left connected to 
the PCI IRQ lines, and is causing problems.. I assume pulling the lines 
up/down incorrectly.
My BIOS lets me define which PIC IRQs are allocated to PCI and which are 
"reserved". I set them all to reserved, effectively disabling any IRQs < 15 
being allocated to PCI. Now everything works perfectly. 
I've downloaded the manual for your motherboard, but I can't see anything like 
that for your board.. all you can do is the standard choose IRQ, or auto.
Anyway, now I know what is causing this, expect a patch soon.
