Nope. Not directly. The only in-kernel use of "shared objects" is in the
quasi-shared object that is VDSO, but that's entirely different (the
kernel provides what looks like a shared library to userspace).
Also, you probably want to ask these questions on the kernelnewbies
mailing list, and check the archive for similar questions - both of
these questions you asked this evening have come up before :)
Jon.
