Ok so it somehow works slowly with GRU and you are happy with it. What 
about the RDMA folks etc etc?

Would it not be better to have a solution that fits all instead of hacking 
something in now and then having to modify it later?

Hmmm.. There were earlier discussions of changing the anon vma lock to a 
rw lock because of contention issues in large systems. Maybe we can just 
generally switch the locks taken while walking rmaps to semaphores? That 
would still require to put the invalidate outside of the pte lock.
