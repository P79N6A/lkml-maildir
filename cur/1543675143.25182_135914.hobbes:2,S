Well, I tried to reboot (blindly, only with a keyboard attached) on the
new kernel, but it behave the same way : "boot -fl 1" (1 is the new kernel)
does a few disk accesses to load the kernel, then hangs, while "0" boots
correctly, so I'm sure my keyboard is correctly plugged and I don't mistype.
Sorry Ivan for such a miserable report, but I couldn't plug either a VT or a
VGA display. I will retry -rc5 (or -rc6) ASAP, but for now I'm going to bed.
Marcelo, the AHA29160 on this system (alpha) spurts lots of debug messages
"blk: queue 0xffff..." at boot with the version in -rc3. Justin pointed me
to drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:268 which is responsible for the message. It's
marked as debug, but no KERN_XXX prefix is used. So I think that either
KERN_DEBUG should be added, or the message should simply disappear, since it
sends garbage on the screen which makes SCSI detection a bit hard to read.
Here are two quickly written, completely untested patch proposals.
Please note that this code has not changed since 2.4.20 (which I never tested
on this machine).
Regards,
Willy
