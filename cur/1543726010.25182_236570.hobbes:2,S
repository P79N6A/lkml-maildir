Think about interrupts: they are permitted to acquire the tasklist_lock 
for read.
Someone does
    read_lock(&tasklist_lock);
    task_lock(tsk);
One example is __do_SAK in tty_io.c, but I think there are further examples.
Now add a softirq that tries to deliver a signal: kill_something_info() 
contains a
    read_lock(&tasklist_lock);
This sequence doesn't deadlock - rw spinlocks starve writers.
But it means that both
    task_lock();
    write_lock_irq(&tasklist_lock);
and
    write_lock_irq(&tasklist_lock);
    task_lock();
can deadlock with the read_lock()/task_lock()/read_lock() sequence.

It probably works by chance in 2.4.
