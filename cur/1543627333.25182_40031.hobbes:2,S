I see no reason to believe that evlog would behave any differently
from printk in this regard.

yes, of course you can, and it's just as stupid as passing a lot of 
data through evlog.

show why this is a serious problem.

frankly, evlog is a solution in search of a problem.  I see no reason
printk can't do TSC timestamping, more robust and/or efficient buffering,
auto-classification in klogd, realtime filtering/notification in userspace,
even delaying of formatting, and logging of binary data.
