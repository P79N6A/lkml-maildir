Andi is correct.  Although the results I posted may seem to indicate
we are concentrating on high thread counts, this is really secondary
to reducing lock contention within the scheduler.  A co-worker down
the hall just ran pgbench (a postgresql db) benchmark and saw
contention on the runqueue lock at 57%.  Now, I know nothing about this
benchmark, but it will be interesting to see what happens after
applying my patch.
