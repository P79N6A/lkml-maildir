If you must, you could wrap it in MODULE.  I don't see the value in
removing every single warning from the kernel build.  If you're intent on
chasing all these pointless things, try installing gcc 3.3 and compiling
a kernel with that.  It'll pump out more warnings than you can shake
a pointy stick at.  Or turn on -W with gcc 2.96 -- it has much the
same effect.  I made an effort to remove some of the -W warnings from
the header files a while ago so I could compile individual files with
-W as I find it tends to point out some mistakes I often make.
