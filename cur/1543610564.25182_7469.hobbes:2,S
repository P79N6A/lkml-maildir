Yes. My ESS1370 just stops sometimes. usually when im flicking between tracks 
in xmms (i.e. /dev/dsp is getting initialised and uninitialised a few times a 
second). the only way to fix it is a reboot. I've tried reinserting the 
module, but it still doesnt work. This has happened on a few kernel versions 
in the 2.4 series, but it didnt happen in 2.2
