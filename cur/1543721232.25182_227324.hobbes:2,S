I know that "me toos" are of limited use, but I have also been 
experiencing this problem. I can give some specific details, and on 
request am willing to work to produce additional diagnostics / test 
patches etc.
I am using a Toshiba Satellite 2410-603 with a P4 M processor, and I 
have experienced difficulties with Gentoo-patched 2.6.3 sources, 
Gentoo-patched 2.6.5 sources and vanilla 2.6.6 sources, with 
CONFIG_PREEMPT both on and off.
Of the three, 2.6.3 seems the least affected - although I do get 
occasional keyboard lockups, if I use the mouse for a few seconds the 
keyboard becomes re-enabled. On both the 2.6.5 and 2.6.6 kernels a 
keyboard lockup seems permanent, although I haven't tried leaving it for 
more than a minute or two.
I too can see warnings from atkbd.c in the kernel messages (on all three 
kernel versions) reporting 'Unknown key pressed' and 'too many keys 
pressed'.
I am well aware that Toshiba keyboards are buggy - under 2.4 kernels I 
experienced multiple key event problems, so I think what's being asked 
here on this thread is not that the keyboard driver be "fixed" as such, 
but that, if possible, it is extended to work around the buggy hardware.
Thanks,
Sean
