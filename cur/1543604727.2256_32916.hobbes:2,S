2.4.12-ac1 has a bug in the reiserfs writepage func.  It was actually
introduced (by us) back in 2.4.10-ac by a patch that merged in changes from
the pure linux kernel.  Anyway, check your logs for warnings from brelse.
If you've got apps running that hit writepage at all (vmware, staroffice,
some databases), you've probably hit this bug.
In ac1, alan dropped all the reiserfs patches he's been including to get
the -ac and the linus reiserfs code bases closer together, so there should
not be any other problems.  My test machine is tied up right now though, so
I haven't hammered on -ac yet.
I'd suggest grabbing reiserfsck 3.x.0k-pre10 and checking the FS.  I'd aslo
apply this (or wait for ac2).
Note, alan might fix this by merging the put_bh change in
end_buffer_io_async, in which case this patch will apply cleanly but be
completely wrong.  Check -ac2 carefully to see if it is still required
before using it there.  This is -ac specific, don't apply to pure linus
kernels.
