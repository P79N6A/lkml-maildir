Subject: 2.5 module development mailing list needed?  [Fwd: Linux Security Module  Interface]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
Since the 2.5 kernel development will require continued module
architecture changes to accomodate power management, pluggable
security and PCMCIA in the kernel tree, it would seem to make
sense that the various groups that are doing module related
architecture changes collaborate and be aware of what each
other are doing, so that changes can be coordinated.
Groups that contain individuals who might be interested 
might include:  
	acpi@phobos.fs.tum.de
	linux-hotplug-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
	linux-power@phobos.fs.tum.de
	linux-security-module@wirex.com
	LKML
Comments?
