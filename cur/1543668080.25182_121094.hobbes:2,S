It means Dave sucks and hasn't done a good enough job on the parser.
parsemce is really really unintuitive to use.
There's some bits missing from your dump. Usually, MCEs look like..
 Sep  4 21:43:41 hamlet kernel: CPU 0: Machine Check Exception: 0000000000000004
 Sep  4 21:43:41 hamlet kernel: Bank 1: f600200000000152 at 7600200000000152
All we have to go on in your example is the bank status code.
(which is -s, not -e. -e would be the 00000000000000004 in the example above. [*])
So, without the missing bits, we have to fake it..
(davej@deviant:davej)$ ./a.out -b 1 -e 1 -s 9000000000000151 -a 0
Status: (1) Restart IP valid.
parsebank(1): 9000000000000151 @ 0
	External tag parity error
	Error enabled in control register
	Memory heirarchy error
	Request: Generic error
	Transaction type : Instruction
	Memory/IO : Reserved
Ignore the Status: line, thats decoded from the (faked) -e 1.
Any the wiser ? 8-)  [*]

[*] See, unintuitive, evil and nasty.
    Given the time, I'd start over from scratch.
