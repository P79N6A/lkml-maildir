but this still applies as there were a number of backlight changes
merged just before 2.6.21-rc1 and your driver will not work with
2.6.21-rc1.

Yes, my point is that you shouldn't need to touch pxafb if you use the
backlight class. I know pxafb has backlight hooks but they are probably
going to get removed at some point as they should no longer be needed.

What changes do you need to it to be able to use it as a generic driver?
The main issue is that the structure definition is in one of the
sharpsl.h files at the moment so most drivers can't get to it. Fix that
and it should make a good generic driver.
Ideally I'd prefer to leave the name alone since there is broken
userspace on the Zaurus that uses that name but I can see why people
want it renamed if its to be used as a generic driver...
