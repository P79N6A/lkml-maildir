Hi James, thanks for your comment.

atomic_inc_return() is not defined for arm,arm26,i386,x86_64 and um archtectures.
This attached patch adds atomic_inc_return() and atomic_dec_return() to arm,i386 and x86_64.
It is implemented by 'xaddl' operation with LOCK prefix for i386 and x86_64.
But this operation is permitted after i486 processor only.
Another implementation may be necessary for i386SX/DX processor.
But 'xaddl' operation is used in 'include/asm-i386/rwsem.h' unconditionally.
I think it has agreed on using 'xaddl' operation in past days.
Is it acceptable? Any comment please.
(*) The implementation for ARM is simple wrapper to atomic_add_return().
