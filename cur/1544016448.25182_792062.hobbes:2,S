My approach was:
"PATCH should solve a problem per file", like:
 capability.h: extern's make no sense in userspace
 coda_psdev.h: extern's make no sense in userspace
 in6.h: extern's make no sense in userspace
 nubus.h: extern's make no sense in userspace
 socket.h: extern's make no sense in userspace
But this warnings was in many files:
 include of <linux/types.h> is preferred over <asm/types.h> : 15 files
 found __[us]{8,16,32,64} type without #include <linux/types.h> : 52 files
So in place of making 15 + 52 = 67 patches, I made 2 patches for each warning.

Should I make 67 patches ?
