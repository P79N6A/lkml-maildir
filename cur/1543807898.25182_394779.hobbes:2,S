Two things come to mind: can you try doing a vmstat 1 while running the 
test and compare 2.4 vs 2.6?  Also, does it make a difference if you switch 
from the e100 driver to eepro100?

If the CPU is pegged that will guide fixing things quite nicely, but the 
fact that it's 1ms per line sounds like something more sinister.
