Hi,
I'm a graduate student doing something about IP security. To implement a
security gateway using Linux, I'm reading 'new_tunnel.c' by Sam
Lantinga, and want to rewrite it to implement IPSec tunneling.
There are 3 question about the new_tunnel.c:
1.In tunnel_xmit():
    rt=ip_rt_route(iph->daddr,0,);
    if(rt->rt_flags & RTF_GATEWAY)
            target=rt->rt_gateway;         /* Question: When the
rt->rt_flags & RTF_GATEWAY is true? */
                    /* In other words, by what configuration this
condition will meet?  Can u give examples?*/
    else
            target=dev->pa_dstaddr;
2.As the example gaven by README.tunnel, the normal procedure to
configure tunnel is as below:
    #ifconfig tunl0 202.115.6.1 pointopoint 202.115.5.1
    #route add 202.115.5.1 dev eth0
    #route add -net 202.115.5.0 dev tunl0
So, all IP packets from 202.115.6.1to 202.115.5.x, but 202.115.5.1 will
be encapsulated. If I also need to encapsulate packet from 202.115.6.1
to 202.115.5.1, what should I do? (to implement security gateway).
3. Is new_tunnel.c a right place to implement IP ESP tunneling? or,
other places as ip_forward be better?
Thanks for any suggestion from you.
Chen l.
