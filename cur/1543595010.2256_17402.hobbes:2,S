I saw the same message.
The comment before wait_for_cmd_done() function in
linux/drivers/net/eepro100.c says:
/* How to wait for the command unit to accept a command.
   Typically this takes 0 ticks. */
And the initial value for the bogus counter, named "wait", is 1000.
Is it enough for your machine?
I applied attached patch, eepro100.patch.  After that, I've never seen
the message from wait_for_cmd_done().  And, my NIC works fine.
You may want to adjust the initial value for the bogus counter.
I don't know the appropriate value for this bogus counter.
I hope this helps you.
