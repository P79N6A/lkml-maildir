So that leaves two choices:
1. Perfect elevator (CSCAN) without the O(1) optimization. (My second
   patch.)
2. Suboptimal elevator with the O(1) optimization. (Andrea's suggested
   modification to my second patch.)
Since the request queue can not be very long, minimizing disk head
movements ought to be more important than saving a few CPU cycles, so
I vote for the first alternative.
