I don't see a problem with having a flags argument. It could give us some
flexibility in the future which would otherwise require a much bigger
update. If we found out that we needed intr, it could just be a flag.

Yeah - so long as we're not taking a page fault between write_begin /
write_end, there's no reason for the cluster locks to be taken and dropped
within the individual callbacks, which means we can just take them in
write_begin (where page lock ordering is possible) and hold them until
write_end is called.

Great, thanks - it just occured to me that I should be holding the clusters
locks across the entire copy (as I point out above), so I'll have a slightly
updated version of this patch for you soon :)
