Ingo, how am I supposed to react to this? I'm asking a simple question
and I get this? I'm at serious loss how to deal with you. :-(
Above is based on theoritical values, for a 300HZ kernel these two 
processes should get 30 and 3 ticks. Should there be any rounding error or 
off by one error so that the processes get one tick less than they should 
get or one tick is accounted to the wrong process, my theoritical value is 
still within the possible error range and doesn't contradict your
practical values.
Playing around with some other nice levels, confirms the theory that 
something is a little off, so I'm quite correct at saying that the ratio 
_should_ be 1:10.
OTOH you are the one who is wrong about me (again). :-(
bye, Roman
