No worries, if you do happen to recall what compilers or arches you've
seen the constant folding fail to happen, I'd still like to know just
what landmines are out there ;-)  If it was an -O0 build I'm comfortable
the new version won't suffer from the same problem, otherwise I'm all
ears.

I imagine that must be the case, but I run sparse fairly regularly, so
I'd have noticed ;-)
