And you keep missing the fact that having both in the tree doesn't solve 
anything. Bugs are not a problem in the development series, bugs are 
found and fixed.
However, having both in the tree can mean only one of a few things:
1. kbuild24 will slowly become unmaintained
2. kbuild25 will slowly become unmaintained
3. both will be partially broken for certain newly added targets (e.g. 
author FOO adds driver BAR and only adjusts only of the kbuilds for his 
driver, and you end up with kbuild24 building certain modules and 
kbuild25 building certain other modules, ugh)
4. everybody will have to put in double work to update both kbuilds, test 
changes, etc.
None of the above looks acceptable, IMNHO.
You need to break it up FEATURE BY FEATURE, that's the only way it will go
in. Then you add one feature to the existing kbuild, test, release, get 
bug reports, fix bugs, add the next feature, rinse, repeat.
Also, don't say 'well you need the core to do this and that', it only shows 
that you don't understand the core and you're treating it like a black box.
Once you do understand it, you'll see there are many ways to break it up 
feature-wise.
