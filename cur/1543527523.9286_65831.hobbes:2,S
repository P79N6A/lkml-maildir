The SystemV/MLS product from AT&T Federal (circa 1986) co-opted
the group bits as the index into a table which included a variety
of security attributes. Their experiance influenced the POSIX work.
No one else ever did such a thing as a result of their experiance.

It's true!

The 1003.1e/2c group came into the effort without a clue of what
to do. If the document resembles a camel, well that's why. No one
had an implementation at the begining. We designed our own and each
others systems together.

Well, actually, no, that had nothing to do with it. We broke up due
to lack of corporate sponsorship. POSIX as a whole had lost favor,
trusted systems hadn't recovered from the "C2 in '92" collapse,
and I DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO POUGHKEEPSIE ANY MORE!

As flattering as the description might be, We recognize Our falability.
Especially when it comes to spelling.
