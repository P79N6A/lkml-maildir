I have been using 2.4.24 with SMP and hyperthreading with no
problems. FYI, the reference to Windows is useless, because
M$ was unable to make any SMP stuff function without crashes
since windows 2000/professional, later Windows versions don't
use your additional CPUs at all, they just report that they
exist. FYI, see if you can find your CPU resources at all
in XP!!!  They just don't want you to know!
Cheers,
