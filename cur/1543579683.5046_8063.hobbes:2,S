Code is written by the few.
Code is read by the many, and having _ in there makes it MUCH easier to
read. Visual comparison of "SomeFunctionName" and "some_function_name"
is faster even for a coder where there may be a typo (try dropping a character)
or mis identifing two different symbols with similar names:
	d_hash_mask
	d_hash_shift
This is relatively easy to read. conversely:
	DHashMask
	DHashShift
Are more difficult to spot. 
In this case "The good of the many outweigh the good of the few".
