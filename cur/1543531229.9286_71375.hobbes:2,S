No; overcommit involves something totally different. All the users
could have malloc()ed 2Gb blocks of address space, provided they
didn't USE it. (A sparse matrix, for example. A classic example of
overcommit making code MUCH simpler.)
Overcommit doesn't involve quotas. It just involves demand-allocation
of memory.
