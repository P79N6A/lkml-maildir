But there's no evidence whatsoever that this is something we can't

It's explicitly mentioned as one of the use cases for trip point 
alteration in the spec.

Which suggests that we're probably doing something wrong at some more 
fundamental level...

I agree that being able to lower trip points is unlikely to result in 
hardware damage, but still think that it's likely to be papering over 
genuine bugs that we could fix properly.
