Thank you..  I've not tried that.  My current effort is turning off the level 2
cache on the cpu. It seems to have worked on one of the 4 computers I've tested.
Now I'm trying it on one of the others.  I'm using an ASUS P2BF mb with a
366mhz Celeron cpu and 32 megs of SDRAM.  In the bios the SDRAM Configuration
setting is set to "BY SPD".  The options are 7ns, 8ns, and disabled.  Do you
have a suggestion on which to select?
