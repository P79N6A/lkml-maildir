The file type is already stored in the directory for all filesystems
that say "FULL SUPPORT".
The patch changes where it is returned -- by not having to call stat(),
the inode is not read from disk.  As a bonus you reduce inode cache
thrashing.
For filesystems that store the inode in the directory itself, there is
no saving in I/O.  You may as well return the type info anyway because
it reduces kernel inode cache thrashing and reduces the number of
syscalls.
enjoy,
