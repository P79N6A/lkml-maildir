I noticed that but thought the change in return value type
had some higher purpose I had not perceived. If it can be int
that would be the way to go.

I don't count on higher level locking for
synchronization issues specific to the driver.
I thought the current compat_ioctl() was already
meant to *not* have the BKL just like unlocked_ioctl.
My thought was that any driver getting a recent update
like compat_ioctl() would need to be reviewed for BKL
safety and take the lock manually if necessary.
Drivers that are falling behind wont have a compat_ioctl
defined at all.
