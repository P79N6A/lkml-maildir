Considering how early in the boot sequence swap partitions are
activated, it seems optimistic to assume that the monitoring equipment
will always start up in time to catch the initial swapons.  It would
be more useful if a marker parameter was included in the swap events
to let a tool/user map to /proc/swaps or a file name.
