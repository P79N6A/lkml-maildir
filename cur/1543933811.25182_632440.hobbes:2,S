Oh, at the moment I couldn't care less about power savings, I'm more 
interested in simply getting the kernel properly -booting- on this hardware.
Right now, with your patch and the 'noirqdebug' option or disabling nohz 
the system appears to be stable.  This laptop otherwise locks up trying 
to configure apic/lapic, or locks up solid later with NO oops/bug and 
nothing will bring it out of it (eg, sysrq has no effect).  NMI watchdog 
was also inoperable, which I believe was due to the apic/lapic being 
disabled.
With your patch, the lapic is used:
ACPI: LAPIC (acpi_id[0x00] lapic_id[0x00] enabled)
ACPI: LAPIC (acpi_id[0x01] lapic_id[0x01] enabled)
These kernel dmesg logs are hand-transcribed, and are from 2.6.22.5, but 
this shows where the kernel would lock up good and solid:

Yeah, I actually found a how-to on how to pull down Linus's git tree, 
and managed to patch -p1 against that.  Kudos to the folks who set up 
faqs on using git.
Anyway, I'm extremely open to getting to the bottom of working around 
the quirks on this hardware.  If I havn't mentioned it previously, this 
laptop is an HP dv6408nr, with an amd turion tl-56 cpu and nVidia MCP51 
chipset.
What can I do to help?  It has been pulling teeth trying to get to the 
bottom of this.
