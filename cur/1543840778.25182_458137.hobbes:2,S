I don't think the deadlock scenario changes if cpufreq stops using
lock_cpu_hotplug() and starts using its own internal lock like
workqueue_mutex. This is unless the lock-heirarchy can be worked out in 
advance (i.e at compile time itself), which leads to the next question:

How is the "order" of the chain exposed? Moreover this needs to be
exposed at compile time itself so that people can code it correctly in
the first place! This cannot be done so easily unless we use priority
for notifiers (different priorities for different callbacks) or some
linking magic, which makes it somewhat ugly to maintain.
IMHO ensuring this heriarchy of locking order is maintained to avoid
deadlocks will be nightmarish. 
I would also feel more comfortable at another aspect of this single lock
- it will make both callback processing and cpu_online_map changes to be
atomic, though I can't think of specific example where having non-atomic 
callback processing hurts (*shrug*, just a safety feeling derived from 
experience of fixing many cpu hotplug bugs in the past).
