I personally feel that it is imperative to have some kind of "lower
level" statistics available by default in the VM.  It would
undoubtedly save some head scratching for most bug reports.
We have all of this kind of stuff in the networking, because the SNMP
mibs require us to keep track of the information.  I can say for
certain that several bugs were found quickly because we were able to
notice anomalies in the events being triggered on the person's
machine.
There is a bit of a performance issue, since our VM is decently
threaded.  That can be solved with per-cpu statistics blocks like
the networking uses.
