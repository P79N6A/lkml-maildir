Yeah, just give a view up from what I tried today
2.6.9-rc2-mm2: works as user & root
2.6.9: doesn't work
2.6.9-ac3: doesn't work
2.6.9-ac6: doesn't work
I know I had first successful burned DVDs with 2.6.9-ac3, but I couldn't
get it running agin. The kernel sees the device somehow, but totaly
wrong, corrupted and not usable for burning. As root its often not seen
at all.
Should I try the thing again with the IEEE/Firewire people? This might
be the only solution to this very annoying problem.
lg, clemens
