That would be nice.

Yes, there are, most of the time. Let me explain:
swsusp needs half of memory free. So it shrinks caches (by emulating
memory pressure) so that half of memory if free (and optionaly shrinks
them some more). Pages are pushed into swap by this process.
Now, that works perfectly okay for me (with 1.5GB machine). I can
imagine that on 128MB machine, shrinking caches to 64MB could hurt a
bit. I guess we'll need to find someone interested with small memory
machine (if there are no such people, we can happily ignore the issue
:-).
