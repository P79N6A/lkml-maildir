Works, modulo bugs.  Shouldn't be hard to get work on top of
paravirt_ops.  The current 2.6.18 code uses function pointers already
because the dom0 code looks very different from domU code.  It is one of
the items on my todo list.  I'll probably look into it once I'm done
with the earlyprintk and console mess ...
cheers,
  Gerd
