I think I'm wearing holes in my platters. This is being a swine to hit, but I finally got some..
It seems to respond to a combination of high cpu usage and relatively high disk utilisation.
I tried all sorts of acrobatics with multiple readers and hammering the array while reading from 
individual drives..
The only reliable way I can reproduce this seems to be on a degraded array running a "while true ; 
do md5sum -c md5 ; done" on about a 180GB directory of files. It is taking anywhere from 4 to 96 
hours to hit it though.. but at least it's reproducible.
