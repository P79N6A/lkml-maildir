yes, i'm well aware of the other archs.  :)
i think "breaks" is a little strong, though.  perhaps it is slower on
older hardware. can you say *how* slow an integer multiplication by a
constant is on older SPARC CPUs or on, say, a 486, compared to memory
references on these machines?  that's the real tradeoff here, and i think
it would be good to measure the difference under load before dismissing
the idea.
