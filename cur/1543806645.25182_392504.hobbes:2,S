Ok, I took the config file I sent you, globally substituted '=y' for
'=m' and rebuilt, then booted that kernel. Other than a message that it
was unable to open the console (udev wasn't started) I got the exact
same failure (same panic backtrace).

One of the things I wanted to see was how the -rt patch worked with
SELinux, so I decided to try and run a kernel that looked like a distro
kernel (in this case FC4).  I just put together some scripting logic to
build the kernel and module tree three times (athlon64, p3smp, and
duron).  After I've rebuilt, I install on each target system using a
shell script that deletes the old module tree, rsyncs a new one,
installs the matching kernel and builds a new initrd.
Hmmm, FC4 is based on 2.6.14.x. Did something change in the 2.6.15
series that needs a user-space change as well? (I'm running a current
FC4 rootfs).
