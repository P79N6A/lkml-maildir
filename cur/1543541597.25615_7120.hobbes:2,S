For end-users, the extra streams probably won't be visible through
whatever front end they are using. Think .files, for example.

It's a nice simple approach which doesn't break everything. The
alternative you seem to be proposing breaks just about everything which
touches files...
Adding a "list streams of this file" API call to VFS would be nice. Better
still, a nice generic "list all files of this variety" facility... It's
not essential, though.

Not really. What precisely ARE EA's, from the user's perspective? They
will look and work a lot like other files, in most cases. Copying the
directory will work as expected. Deleting the directory, too. OK, a simple
"cp file /tmp/" will miss off the EA's, unless you're using an EA-aware
version of cp - but my approach does avoid data-loss, unlike all the
others I've seen mentioned here.

That's how Unix works. You have write access to the parent directory, you
can delete the file. If you can delete "the file", surely you can also
delete the EAs attached to it?
