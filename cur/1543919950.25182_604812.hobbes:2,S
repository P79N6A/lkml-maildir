Well, from the few reports I got it seems not all Elantech touchpads are
created equal. And as we don't have any documentation on these touchpads I
really don't know whether they all support absolute mode, have the same
parameters or use the same protocol for it.
So for the time being I really would like to keep support for absolute as
well as relative mode in to make it easier for users to switch and test and
find out and report where thing go wrong.
Maybe that once we find out more about these touchpads and the possible
different version we can focus on a solution that will fit all. But let's
not do it while users are still trying whether the driver works for them at
all... :)
