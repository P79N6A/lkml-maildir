Hi!
The aforementioned kernel outputs strange things whenever I run (cd /;updatedb):
find: /mnt/work/Progger/Source/ibmiso/ibmiso.q: No such file or directory
(A while ago it output three of these lines with different files;
maybe two have been fixed by accessing them?)
(I assume updatedb runs a more-or-less ``simple'' find over my
partitionsa). It looks like it detects a file at directory examination
stage and then cannot re-detect it if it is *stat()ed by name.
/mnt/work is an affs partition. Any ideas? This is quite strange.
I don't think the partition is corrupt since it works perfectly and
affs doesn't give me a single error message.
Please send me Cc:s, since I'm not subscribed to the list.
ciao,
johnny
