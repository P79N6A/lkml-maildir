Hi,
I have MPC8548 Linux based firewall which will mostly do packet processing
for 80% time.
So obviously most of the time it will RX and TX packets through gianfar
Ethernet driver.
I want to lock my interrupt handler of this driver in the L1 cache.
1. Are there any kernel APIs to lock any function and data in the L1/L2
cache?
2. How can I use "icbtls" - Instruction Cache Block Touch and Lock Set" for
locking my interrupt handler?
3. Is "icbtls" is the correct instruction at which I am looking at?
4. How do I find end address of the interrupt handler or any other function
and how do we pass it to cache locking instructions? (Because it can happen
that interrupt handler size is more than a cache line, not aligned etc)?
5. Can we enhance request_irq() function to take an additional parameter to
lock the interrupt handler in the cache?
I understand that if my interrupt handler is going to be called most of the
time then it is very likely to happen that OS will not flush the same, but
there is no guarantee for it.
Regards,
Parav Pandit
