sure it doesn't spit only this to you. Does it panic ? and do FC6
kernels use an initrd (I guess so) ?

many reasons can prevent you from booting a vanilla kernel on modern distros
try to figure out what is really exec'ed _after_ the kernel
initialization and _before_ init execution
(hint: initramfs)
