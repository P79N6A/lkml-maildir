Well the 2 most obvious licenses would be usage based and escrow like.
1)  In a usage based license you would be required to posses a license 
to use the software.  You would posses the source,  permission to make 
modification, and permission to use the resulting binaries.  Ideally the 
license would also allow redistribution of patches, and reselling licenses.
   This is the sort of license I think Microsoft should be persuing with 
their larger customers.  Giving your customer source, with the ability 
to use modified binaries is just silly.  As far as games go you can see 
how this would work and stimulate sales just by looking at the mod 
community for Tribes, or Quake.  Or the use of the various 3D engines by 
3rd parties.
  While some would argue that this leaves you open to piracy.  Let's be 
honest how many pirates compile anything.  At most they disable the copy 
protection with hex-editor.
2)Escrow licenses are fairly common in business today for various types 
of custom software.  In essence the source is held by a 3rd party and 
given to the customer if the licenser is in breach of contract.   I can 
easily see a license not requiring a third party, but simply stating 
that the source would be released upon the software becoming 
unsupported, after a time frame, or if the vendor failed to address a 
certain class of bug within a time frame.
There is no such thing as obsolete hardware.
Merely hardware that other people don't want.
