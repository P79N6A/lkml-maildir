We currently ignore remount requests that attempt to change the NFS
mount parameters. This is not new behaviour, BTW: it has always been the
case, and nobody has ever requested it.
The ro flag is different, and I agree that it should be moved to the
vfsmount structure. I'm hoping Dave Hansen's patches will be ready for
merging soon...
