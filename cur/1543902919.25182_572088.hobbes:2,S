So basically I can not install a signal handler to catch freeze signal
in the process. Right?
Is there any other way to solve the problem I am facing? After resume
some of the system calls are failing in some of my applications with
errno set as EINTR. I wanted to explore a way to not check for this
error all over the place and somehow retry failed system call. Any
ideas?

Sure.
It's in kernel/signal.c (get_signal_to_deliver) for x86 and x86_64, and 
arch/<name>/kernel/signal.c for other arches. The support for other
arches is 
the place x86 & x86_64 used to use - I wonder if they should be going
away 
(Rafael cc'd to raise this point with him).
