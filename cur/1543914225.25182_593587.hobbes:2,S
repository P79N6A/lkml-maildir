  My condolations ;) Actually, smartctl is not very reliable... I've
heard about disks reporting everything is fine while they were broken.

  It is close to impossible to find out what has happened after the fact
- I guess you don't have the original filesystem image backed-up, do
you? If something like this happens to you next time, try backing up
the filesystem image (via dd) before you run fsck (or if you don't have
enough spare space, you can use e2image to backup at least metadata).
Maybe if you could dig some messages in the system log, it would be
possible to find out what has happened. But with the information we
currently have it's to foggy to be able to debug anything... sorry.
