You can remove these from the list:
ps/2 and serial (for input devices) use the 'serio' layer, which does
have automatic loading.
gameport is missing, but planned. Unfortunately you can't probe for
joysticks before you load the specific modules, so it simply will have
to load all available drivers. On the other hand, gameports are a dying
breed, replaced by USB, which is good.
And the others:
VGA drivers are autoloaded by the PCI subsystem.
VESAfb can't ever be autoloaded.
serial, parallel, gameport, etc are using the PnP subsystem and will be
autoloaded if ACPIPnP reports these devices.
And floppy, well, I think it isn't using ACPIPnP but possibly could ...

The hardware is often found only by the driver, like in the joystick
case. Hopefully ACPIPnP will list all the devices ...

You don't.
