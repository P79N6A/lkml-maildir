I'd rather you went the other way, replacing these
barely-documented instructions with ones that are
easy to look up. Motorola has about a zillion of
these "simplified" instructions. I guess Motorola
and IBM were jealous of Intel's CISC instructions.
The big problem is this:
        THESE ARE NOT IN THE INDEX!!!!!!
So, if I forget what one of these many instructions
does, I'll have quite the time paging through the
manual trying to find it.
If it's not in the index, please avoid it.
