In case anyone is interested, the patch is below.

virt_to_bus/bus_to_virt are long deprecated, mark them as __deprecated 
on i386.
Without such warnings people will never update their code and fix 
the errors in PPC64 builds.
And yes, some of the drivers affected are maintained.
This also catches accidential additions of users for these functions 
like a usage of bus_to_virt() in the infiniband code that was added in 
2.6.17-rc1 (already removed).
This patch increases the number of warnings shown during builds, but it 
seems worth including it at least in -mm for making people aware of this 
issue.
