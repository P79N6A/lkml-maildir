It even communicate the addition/removal of devices to userspace applications
through DBUS (freedesktop.org standard that will be adopted by kde,
gnome, etc - ie: useful stuff). So you don't even need to know the device names: 
the application will receive the notificacion.
Of course, this is doable with devfs. But it's been done already, in a
*much* cleaner way, with udev. So why bother, I wonder...
