Here is a patch that alters the behaviour of pci_find_class; I think it
makes it more useful.
Now pci_find_class returns the next device that matches the request class
and has at least the programming interface specified (i.e. least
significant byte of class).
So, if someone wanted to look at all of the parallel communication
devices, they could use (PCI_CLASS_COMMUNICATION_PARALLEL << 8) as the
class argument to pci_find_class.  If it needs to be at least programming
interface 2, just add 0x02 to that.
Tim.
