It does, but the per cpu data that everybody uses doesn't reside in the PDA
because it wasn't possible to make this work with binutils
It would require a relocation relative to another symbol which isn't
really supported.
At some point I considered using runtime patching to work around
this limitation, but it would be some work and relatively complex.
So the PDA just contains a pointer to the real per CPU area and it's
added. Unfortunately it's three instructions or so and not atomic 
(mov, add, reference)

No atomic operations. Preemption just requires to increase a counter
in thread info.
Also on non preemptive kernels - which are the majority - it's a single
instruction on x86. I guess preempt users can live with a bit more
overhead ...
