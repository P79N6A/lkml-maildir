But that's the wrong thing to do! For example, I start a simulation that
runs for two months. Then some one starts an app that gobbles memory. My
long-running simulation malloc's 5 bytes and runs out of memory.
Why should I be penalized for somebody else's problem? SIGKILL the
offending app, not some large but otherwise well-behaved and valuable
process.

Pointless. This just delays the inevitable. Why not just mount all your
swap in the first place? If you have more, then you aren't really OOM.

Why several? You're more likely to kill "innocent" processes.

So you fix an OOM condition by dynamically adding memory? That seems
backwards. If you had extra swap, why not use it in the first place.

The only possibilities are to (a) enforce hard memory limits with no
overcommit, thereby wasting large amounts of swap space that will never
get used while not really solving the problem, or (b) killing the
offending process(es). Rik's approach seems to be a good implementation of
(b); in fact, I am starting to believe that his general approach (and I
say nothing about his implementation here) is the ONLY reasonable way to
deal with OOM situations.
