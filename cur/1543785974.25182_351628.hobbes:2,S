What makes it seem so? That binfmt_script supports a certain convention
doesn't mean that all other programs also somehow need to support that
convention - and certainly not in the same way.

What makes you suppose that? I have no plans to submit such a patch.

Because there are no problems arising. The next time somebody submits
a patch to cat(1) to strip off UTF-8 signatures, you *then* complain
that this is the wrong thing to do, because it violates the
specification of cat.
This reasoning is just flawed: it is like saying to a web browser
developer: "don't _support_ XHTML, because there are so many tools
which use HTML 4".

Indeed, it does. There is nothing inherently wrong with having
the marker in the middle.

Certainly. However, you specifically talked about 'wc -c', and, in
wc(1), atleast in the implementation commonly used on Linux, characters
and bytes are not the same.

You talked about Windows specifically. On Windows, most editors give you
the choice of chosing the line ending, and will preserve whatever line
ending they find when adding new lines to a file.
