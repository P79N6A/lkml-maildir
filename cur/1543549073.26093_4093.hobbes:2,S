It is not. Period. Full stop. Check cont_prepare_write() and you will see
a counterexample in the same fs/buffer.c. Yes, they are used in exactly
the same manner.
	Generic function for file modifications is generic_file_write().
block_prepare_write() lives several layers below and is used only for some
of the local filesystems (ones where it fits).

	? Chris, I hope you've noticed that e.g. ext2_prepare_write()
lives in fs/ext2/inode.c, not in fs/buffer.c. So I don't see what stops
you from pulling _any_ data you want.
