Note that I'm not necessarily arguing for slowing down, but for reduced
functional conflicts (which slow down may help but it's not the only
solution). I think that refining the time resolution might achieve the
same goal. Instead of merging 10000 changes which each have 1% chance
of breaking any other area, and have all developers try to hunt bugs
caused by unrelated changes, I think we could do that in steps.
To illustrate, instead of changing 100 areas with one of them causing
breaking in the other ones, and having 100 victims try to hunt the
bug in 99 other areas, then theirs, and finally insult the faulty
author, we could merge 50 areas in version X and 50 in X+1 (or 3*33
or 4*25, etc...). That way, we would only have 50 victims trying to
find the bug in 49 other areas (or 32 or 24). Less people wasting
their time will mean faster validation of changes, and possibly
faster release cycle with better quality.
People send you their crap every two months. If you accept half of
it every month, they don't have to sleep on their code, and at the
same time at most half of them are in trouble during half the time
(since bugs are found faster).

well, is "let's split changes" ok ?
