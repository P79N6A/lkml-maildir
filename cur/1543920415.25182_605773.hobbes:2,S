Grin, if the two were the same, there'd be no reason to write a new one.
I didn't expect faster writes on btrfs, at least not for workloads that
did not require reads.  The basic idea is to show there are a variety of
ways the larger blocks can improve (and hurt) performance.
Also, vmap isn't the only implementation path.  Its true the Btrfs
changes for this were huge, but a big chunk of the changes were for
different leaf/node blocksizes, something that may never get used in
practice.
