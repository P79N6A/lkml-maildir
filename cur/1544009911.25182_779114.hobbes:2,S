Subject: [PATCH][RFC 10/23]: SCST user space backend handler
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch contains user space backend dev handler. It allows to 
implement in the user space virtual SCSI devices in the SCST 
environment. See description of its interface here: 
http://scst.sourceforge.net/scst_user_spec.txt
An example of an application that uses this interface is fileio_tgt. You 
can download this software from 
https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=110471&package_id=283232.
 
This application is a full feature virtual disk emulator similar to 
scst_vdisk backend dev handler.
