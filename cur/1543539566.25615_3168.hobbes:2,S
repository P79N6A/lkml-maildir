	I hardly see it as such.  Linux folk didn't come to you and ask
you to run Linux.  One of the reasons Linux is so good/useful is because
the ones who developed it cared about being technically correct, and not
about the political crap.

	That's their problem.  If they chose Linux, fine, if not, guess
what?  That's fine too.  Technical correctness is what brought people
to Linux in the first place, tossing it out the window because we're
scared users are going to leave is downright idiotic.

	Of course, I'd be curious if anything existed that did not
contain this flaw.  If you can get to a point where you can execute
arbitrary code on the machine chances are pretty good, no matter what
OS, you can do the same damn thing.  Sure, you can put checks in and
whatnot and try to not let it happen, but in the end I'd be very
suprised if you could totally stop it w/o fixing the broken hardware.

	That's nice.
