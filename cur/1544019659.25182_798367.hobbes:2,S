I don't think you understand the goal/model for the drivers/staging/
subdirectories.  This is where "drivers" and other stand-alone chunks of
code live while they are not yet up to the real mergable status for the
rest of the kernel tree.  While there, they get cleaned up, fixed up,
and then hopefully, merged into the main portion of the kernel tree when
the proper subsystem maintainers say it is ok.
Whenever code in these directories is loaded, it taints the kernel with
a TAINT_CRAP flag so that everyone involved knows to ignore any bug
reports.
So while a review would be wonderful to have, it's not being asked for
for this specific low-memory "driver".  I'd like to see your final
version of what you proposed a while ago, if that goes into the kernel
tree, then this chunk of code will merely be deleted entirely.
Hope this helps explain things better,
