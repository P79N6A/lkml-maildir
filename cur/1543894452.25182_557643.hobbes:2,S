By your reasoning it doesn't even matter. I own the hardware, I should be able 
to change the BIOS to *any* chunk of code I want.
Do you see the fallacy here? You're making an artificial distinction based on 
whether the *SOFTWARE* has a certain license or not.

And the reason behind this is all "ethics and morals". In other words, you are 
forcing those "ethics and morals" on others and hiding it by giving it a 
different name.

No, it doesn't. There is no requirement in the license in question that makes 
a persons ability to run the program on any given piece of hardware. What it 
does say is you can't stop someone from *TRYING* to do that.

If the intent of a law (or license) is to do A but it doesn't say that, then 
how is the intent to be known? Your answer: Ask the author. Question: how can 
we be absolutely certain that the authors intent *hasn't* changed since the 
law (or license) was written? *ONLY* answer: It is impossible. Conclusion: 
Unless the intent is clearly spelled out at the time the law (or license) is 
written, or is available in other writings by the author of the law/license 
from the same time period as the law/license then it is impossible.
Question: How do you know what the "spirit" of a license is?
Your Answer: Ask the author.
Question: How do we know that the Author hasn't changed their mind about 
the "spirit" of the license since it was written?
*ONLY* Answer: See the answer to the parallel question about "intent".
Now that I've knocked down your "Intent" and "Spirit" straw-men you have no 
way to argue that the GPLv3 is written with the same "spirit" as the GPLv2.
