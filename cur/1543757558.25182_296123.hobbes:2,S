Ok. I've fired off an email to some Intel people asking what the
real rules are wrt Intel PCI-PCI bridges. It may be that it's not that 
particular chip, but some generic rule (like "all Intel bridges act like 
they are subtractive decode _except_ if they actually have the IO 
start/stop ranges set" or something like that).
If anybody on the list can figure the Intel bridge decoding rules out, 
please holler..
