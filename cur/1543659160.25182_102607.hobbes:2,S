This makes sense.  Debian has changed its default compiler to 3.2 in
sid...  Suspect we will get quite a few reports like this one.
Solution would seem to be to fix the links in /usr/bin for:
gcc
g++
gcov
cpp
to point at the 2.95 binary, make clean xconfig
Thanks

PS. The kernel will not link here using 3.2....
