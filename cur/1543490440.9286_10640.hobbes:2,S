I think that's wrong. System libraries are defined as coming with the
base OS. Solaris doesn't ship with a C compiler anymore but it does
come with the necessary libraries and a linker. 
Anyway if I've understood the question correctly, ntddll.dll comes
with NT but not ntddll.lib which you need for your compiler to be able 
to link with it.
