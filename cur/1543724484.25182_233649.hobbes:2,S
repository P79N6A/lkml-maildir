Your BIOS geometry settings are irrelevant. You've just forgotten to enable 
the correct busmaster DMA driver in your kernel. It looks as though this is 
an nForce 2 system, so you need to enable "Generic PCI bus-master DMA 
support", then further down "AMD and nVidia IDE support", in menuconfig. 
You'll then be able to set DMA on, and this will likely resolve the 
performance issue.
In .config, the relevant options are
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_PCI=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_AMD74XX=y
Hope this helps!
