Any modutils >= 2.3.12 will scan /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel.  Check
your version of depmod.

The extra directory structure only costs during depmod processing (once
per boot) and modprobe/insmod while finding the module.  Unless you are
doing 1000's of insmod per second, the difference from the extra
directory structures is down in the noise.  As for your earlier point
about most of the directories only containing one module, it all
depends on your .config.  Try building a kernel with all the modules
turned on and see what you get.
