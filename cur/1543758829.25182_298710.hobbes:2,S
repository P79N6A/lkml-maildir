I think it would be useful for folks to test the 2.6.ODD release because
the understanding is that 2.6.ODD+1 will be out soon, and we are pretty
sure there won't be any large changes in that transition.  Any out-side-the-tree
patches will probably apply to both of these w/out manual hacking,
which also makes testing easier.
I am less likely to test an ODD.pre-Z release because there is likely to be
a large pile coming after that, which means that even if pre-Z worked
fine, I still have to be very paranoid about the final release.
