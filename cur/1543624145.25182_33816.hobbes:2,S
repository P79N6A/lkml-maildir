See postings upthread.  Versioning doesn't play well with link(2), with
overwriting rename(2), etc. - the problem is not that much in implementation
but in finding at least somewhat reasonable semantics for that.
DEC OSes have different filesystem IO model.  There versions are more or
less natural.  With Unix they will clash with a lot of things expected
by every damn application out there.
