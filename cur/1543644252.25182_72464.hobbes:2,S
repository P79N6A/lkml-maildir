in the case of threads my plan is to use the pid alloction bitmap for
this. It slightly overestimates the pids because orphan sessions and pgrps
are included as well, but this should not be a problem because procfs also
does a pid lookup when the specific directory is accessed. This method is
inherently restartable, the pid bitmap pages are never freed, and it's the
most cache-compact representation of the sorted pidlist. And it can be
accessed lockless ...
