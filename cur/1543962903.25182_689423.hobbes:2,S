I am not sure this is right.
I might be wrong if this patch is depended on another patch.
As I see, shrink_zone always return 0 in your patch.
If it is right, I think that return value is useless. It is better
that we change function return type to "void"
Also, we have to change functions that call shrink_zone properly. ex)
balance_pgdat, __zone_reclaim
That functions still use number of shrink_zone's reclaim page
