Well, that was my result, too, when I measured mmap() vs. read()/write()
with the 2.4.x kernels, however, I was quite impressed recently when
I measured write operations with MAP_SHARED regions under 2.6.7
(CPU x86_64), they were not at all slower than ordinary write()s.
(congratulations to the involved kernel hackers on that! :-)

But isn't an advantage with mmap() that there's no need for the kernel
to copy what is to be written to a dedicated buffer? The kernel
could initiate DMA writes directly from the working memory...
