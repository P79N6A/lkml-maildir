Well, the other two possibilities are:
1/ Spin/sleep until a descriptor shows up
2/ Fall back to PIO for a few transfers
Descriptor availability is improved if the code interleaves allocation
and submission.  Currently it looks like we wait until all descriptors
for the scatterlist are allocated before we start submitting.
