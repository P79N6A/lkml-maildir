This adds yet another output section in vmlinux, and there is
no tools which need that. We already have 30+ sections there while we need ~20.
I am trying to fix the mess. Please don't add to it.
Re alignment: (1) do you really realy REALLY need it? Last I checked,
i386 was handling unaligned accesses just fine; and
(2) this works:
		. = ALIGN(4)
 		VMLINUX_SYMBOL(__start___immediate) = .;		\
 		*(__immediate)						\
 		VMLINUX_SYMBOL(__stop___immediate) = .;			\
