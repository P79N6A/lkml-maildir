A new version of Mercurial is available at:
 
http://selenic.com/mercurial/
This version is officially self-hosting, now that I've added the final
planned changed to the metadata. To pull the repo, do:
 hg init
 hg merge 
http://selenic.com/hg
This version fixes numerous reported bugs, adds a "verify" command to
check the repository integrity, transaction handling, and some minor
speed improvements.
