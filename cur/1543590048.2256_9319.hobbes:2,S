    Has anyone looked into memory hot swap/hot add support? 
Adding memory probably isn't going to be too hard... but taking
existing memory off line is tricky. You have to find some way of
finding all the pages that are in use and then dealing with them
appropriately, and when some are locked or contain kernel data this
would be extremely difficult I should think.
    Especially with systems with Chipkill coming out, this would be
    great to support...
Chipkill?
