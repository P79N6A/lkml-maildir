Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch exports __put_task_struct as it is needed by XPMEM.
Signed-off-by: Dean Nelson <dcn@sgi.com>
---
One struct file_operations registered by XPMEM, xpmem_open(), calls
'get_task_struct(current->group_leader)' and another, xpmem_flush(), calls
'put_task_struct(tg->group_leader)'. The reason for this is given in the
comment block that appears in xpmem_open().
        /*
         * Increment 'usage' and 'mm->mm_users' for the current task's thread
         * group leader. This ensures that both its task_struct and mm_struct
         * will still be around when our thread group exits. (The Linux kernel
         * normally tears down the mm_struct prior to calling a module's
         * 'flush' function.) Since all XPMEM thread groups must go through
         * this path, this extra reference to mm_users also allows us to
         * directly inc/dec mm_users in xpmem_ensure_valid_PFNs() and avoid
         * mmput() which has a scaling issue with the mmlist_lock.
