Clock is coupled to chipselect/device.  When the bus controller
switches to the other device, it updates the clock accordingly.
How exactly that's done is system-specific.  Many controllers
just have a register per chipselect, listing stuff like SPI mode,
clock divisor, and word size.  So switching to that chipselect
kicks those in automatically ... devices ignore the clock unless
they've been selected.
So it's like I said earlier.  And going to a new message will
normally involve a new chipselect, yes ... but maybe not, there's
that hint available to avoid the switching.
