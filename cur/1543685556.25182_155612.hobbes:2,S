I don't know, I've had a few SMART capable Maxtor drives go bad to the 
point I knew it without a warning.  Eventually, when things got really 
bad though, they would report SMART errors.  The errors were at first 
intermittent, and then got to the point the warning wouldn't go away.  
In their defense, two of them (I've had 5) had smart errors and I never 
encountered any noticeable defects (still, I replaced them when they 
were doing the upgrade program so I could get a new 3 year warranty). 
All of those are several generations old though, the newer ones I have 
now don't seem to want to die ;-)
