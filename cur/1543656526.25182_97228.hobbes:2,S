Since operating systems like WIN32 are at least published to take
advantage of SYSENTER, it may not be in Linux's interest to
purposefully use a slower interface until 2.8 (how long will that be
until people can use?). The last thing I want to read about in a
technical journal is how WIN32 has lower system call overhead than
Linux on IA-32 architectures. That might just be selfish of me for
the Linux community... :-)
