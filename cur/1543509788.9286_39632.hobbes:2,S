We had to do this on our nameservers to stop similar problems.  Removing
SO_LINGER fixed it.
I created this (cheap) patch that seems to do the trick:
diff -ru src/bin/named/ns_main.c bind-8.2.1/bin/named/ns_main.c
--- src/bin/named/ns_main.c	Thu Jun 17 19:26:54 1999
+++ bind-8.2.1/bin/named/ns_main.c	Thu Jun 24 13:31:22 1999

  */
 int
 sq_openw(struct qstream *qs, int buflen) {
+#undef SO_LINGER
 #ifdef SO_LINGER	/* XXX */
 	static const struct linger ll = { 1, 120 };
 #endif
Against 8.2.1 in this case.  Should also apply to 8.1.2.
