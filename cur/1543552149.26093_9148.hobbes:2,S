The problem here is that NFS pages have 3 rather than 2 states:
  1) mmapped & correct.
  2) mmapped & incorrect. (but possibly dirty)
  3) Unmapped
For case 1), we clearly want to have the page in inode->i_mapping.
For cases 2) & 3) we don't.
However for case 2) we still have a weak association to the inode
itself, and we want to be able to reference inode metadata etc.  Would
it make sense then to remove these pages from i_mapping, but to hang
them onto a new struct address_space (call it i_unmapped for want of a
better name)?
That would allow you to keep a consistent state for the page, while
still allowing you to 'invalidate' it (by removing it from the
i_mapping) and hence maintain a consistent cache.
invalidate_inode_pages() would then reduce to
   remove_page_from_inode_queue(page);
   remove_page_from_hash_queue(page);
   if (page_count(page))
         add_page_to_inode_unmapped(page);
Cheers,
