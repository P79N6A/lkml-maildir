Naj - it's far more trivial I just looked at wrong tree at hand...
But anyway. What happens if somone does set QUEUE_FLAG_STOPPED
between the test_and_claer_bit and taking the spin_lock? Setting
the QUEUE_FLAG_STOPPED isn't maintaining the spin_lock protection!
My goal is to make sure that the QUEUE_FLAG_STOPPED has a valid value
*inside* the q->request_fn call.
This here is where it's supposed to be set:
void blk_stop_queue(request_queue_t *q)
{
         unsigned long flags;
         spin_lock_irqsave(q->queue_lock, flags);
         blk_remove_plug(q);
         spin_unlock_irqrestore(q->queue_lock, flags);
         set_bit(QUEUE_FLAG_STOPPED, &q->queue_flags);
}
And I don't see anything preventing the above problem.
It sould perhaps be?
void blk_stop_queue(request_queue_t *q)
{
         unsigned long flags;
         spin_lock_irqsave(q->queue_lock, flags);
         blk_remove_plug(q);
         set_bit(QUEUE_FLAG_STOPPED, &q->queue_flags); /* Notice 
spinlock still held! */
         spin_unlock_irqrestore(q->queue_lock, flags);
}
void blk_start_queue(request_queue_t *q)
{
         if (test_bit(QUEUE_FLAG_STOPPED, &q->queue_flags)) {
                 unsigned long flags;
                 spin_lock_irqsave(q->queue_lock, flags);
		if (!test_bit(QUEUE_FLAG_STOPPED, &q->queue_flags)) {
			spin_unlock_irqsave(q->queue_lock, flags);
			return;
		}
                 clear_bit(QUEUE_FLAG_STOPPED, &q->queue_flags);
                 if (!elv_queue_empty(q))
                         q->request_fn(q);
                 spin_unlock_irqrestore(q->queue_lock, flags);
         }
}
At least I couldn't see any harm in doing it like above.
And again. I think it would assert that the flag is well defined inside
q->request_fn().
