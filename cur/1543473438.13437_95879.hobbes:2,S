I have read it, and I still think it is at least inconsistent.
Also, I was commenting on the idea that a new license can be applied
to without the owner's consent.  I don't think that is legal.
If the GPL does that, it can't be legal.  If it doesn't, then fine.
It's not totally clear or people would not argue about it so much.
I've talked to people after they read it, and they aren't sure
about it.  
In some ways, I wish it would get tested in court just to see how
things go.
