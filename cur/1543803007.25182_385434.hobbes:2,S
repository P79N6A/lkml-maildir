To the snd-trident ALSA driver or to the snd-ali5451 ALSA driver?
Seriously, if it would be _that_ trivial, I'd have sent such a patch 
instead of opening the ALSA bug.
There's a serious amount of 5050 specific code in the OSS driver, and 
I'd therefore prefer "unsopported in ALSA" over "blindly adding PCI ID 
and most likely non-working".
