If the related /dev/* nodes are owned by root and set up rw-r-r or worse 
for others and requiring write access to send SCSI commands, then you get
the same kind of authentification, but cdrecord would continue to work.
Only if someone would chown the related /dev/* nodes to a user differen from 
root there would be a difference.
P.S.: UNIX philosohy is to allow the administrator to set up bad/wrong permissions.
