At the minimum you could break at the last comma and not in the middle
of expression.
You could also take that block of code and split it to isicom_tx(),
isicom_port_tx() and isicom_chunk_tx(). That would save you couple if
identation levels and allow you to keep the code readable within 80
columns.
Just out of curiosity - was it run through Lindent or reformatted by
hand? The thing is - it might be not readable at 80 columns but I
could expand my terminal and get a decent results. Now it may be
better at 80 columns but no level of resizing terminal will make it
better.
