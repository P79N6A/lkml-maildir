That is a small price to pay, rather than having to continually maintain
"does this file need config.h included" - which I think can conclusively
be shown to be a total lost cause.  There are about 3450 configuration
include errors in the kernel as of -git last night.
Getting config.h includes wrong causes subtle bugs - for instance, one
file may be built with some feature enabled which changes a structure
size, and another filfe may be built with it disabled.
I put forward that maintaining correct config.h include across all
files is demonstratably impossible in such a large source base without
considerable work.
I also put forward that the percentage of compilations which do not need
config.h is small and probably realistically zero.
Therefore, I think that a small slowdown for the few (if any) files which
don't need linux/config.h including is a good tradeoff.
