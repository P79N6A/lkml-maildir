Something is bad with my init process, so with debug patch below I'm
getting:
do_page_fault: force_sig_info SIGSEV to 1, addr ffffe018, eip b7fe576a
do_page_fault: force_sig_info SIGSEV to 1, addr ffffe018, eip b7fe576a
do_page_fault: force_sig_info SIGSEV to 1, addr ffffe018, eip b7fe576a
do_page_fault: force_sig_info SIGSEV to 1, addr ffffe018, eip b7fe576a
continuing forever. 0xffffe018 is inside the vsyscall page so could be
related but the eip should be there too in that case I think...
You have any candidates? I've failed to find any.

Also, this brought me to trying to find what has changed between the
versions which appears a little tricky. Do you think it would be
possible to set up your scripts that currently notify the author of a
patch about the inclusion to CC something like mm-commits list.
That way people can audit patches that have got in before the tarball is
released, it is easy to see what has gone in and when.
