My machine runs 2.0.36 quite happily and my older 166 runs 2.2.3 ok too,
but my main box (see deatils below) hates any 2.2 kernel (have tried up to
2.2.7 under Debian 2.1, Redhat 5.2 and Redhat 6.0)
while attemting to boot with a 2.2 kernel, which compiled without error,
it gets just further than the IDE Hard disk inormation and  displays this:
kmod: failed to exec /sbin/modprobe -s -k binfmt-464c, errno=8
request_module[binfmt-464c]: fork failed, errno 11
and loops this message indefinatley.
This happens even when using no modules or support for them compiled in.
