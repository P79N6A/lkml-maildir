Hi!
My Chip NCR53C810 (device id 0x1, revision id 0x1) isn't detected by
2.3.18 (neither vanilla, nor ac4). All I get on bootup is 
  scsi : 0 host.
  scsi : detected total.
right after the md says 'md driver 0.36.6 MAX_MD_DEV=4, MAX_REAL=8'. 
I tried NCR53C8XX SCSI support (drivers/scsi/53c*, CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX=y) 
and (but not in the same kernel!) NCR53c7,8xx SCSI support 
(drivers/scsi/ncr53c8xx.*, CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C7xx=y), which didn't
change anything, so I guess the problem isn't buried in those drivers.
I didn't try any 2.3.*-Kernel before, but it works with a 2.2.12,
using the NCR53C8XX SCSI support.
Any ideas?
