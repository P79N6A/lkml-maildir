If I read the intent right, this is an example of worst case avoidance, 
where a little average interactivity is traded for preventing the case 
where a single misguided process gets most/all of the CPU and 
performance falls off the edge of the table. As a user I see that as the 
same line of thought which gave us low-latency patches, to trade a 
miniscule bit of one thing to avoid something really undesirable.
I suspect there will be people who don't want to make this trade, 
although it sounds like a good one to me.
