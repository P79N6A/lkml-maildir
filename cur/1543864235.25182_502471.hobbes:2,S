it's the most contended spinlock we have during a parallel kernel 
compile on an 8-way system. But it's pretty common-sense as well, 
without doing any measurements, it's basically the only global lock left 
in just about every VFS workload that doesnt involve massive amount of 
dentries created/removed (which is still dominated by the dcache_lock).

the dcache lock is not a problem during kernel compiles. (its 
rcu-ification works nicely in that workload)
