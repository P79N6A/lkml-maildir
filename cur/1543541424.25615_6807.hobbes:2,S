*shrug*
I'm sure it is very useful to some people, at the very least for accessing
this hidden info on files from other systems. That is why I asked the
question below.
(I guess since I use window managers that don't put icons or positions on
 files I still fail to see the win :)

I wasn't talking about samba, I meant a server on something that does
NTFS, like NT4/5 (eh, win2k). If it does then that means that smbfs should
probably support this. Just like I think the Linux NTFS driver should.
Btw, what happens in NT when you copy such a file from NTFS to say FAT?
(I would check all this myself but I don't have a working NT box around)
