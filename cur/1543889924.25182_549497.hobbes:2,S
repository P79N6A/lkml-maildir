You have the cryptd Kconfig option in (at least in rc3) - presumably
Maximillian has been too keen and turned it on before you were ready :)
It does make sense for it to be the problem. Without PF_NOFREEZE set,
the refrigerator code will try to get it to enter the freezer, and
without the try_to_freeze(), it will just loop and freezing will fail.
