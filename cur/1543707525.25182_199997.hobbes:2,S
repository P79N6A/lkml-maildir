You won't believe it.
It ran in a standard ECS Elitebook A530 Notebook. 
I always waited some time (30 Minutes up to some hours), when it was
cold outside.
I am working with this laptop about 10-20 hours a day, it runs several
compile runs, etc.
Mostly the same things I did on my Acer Travelmate..well this hard disk
died, too..
Well, currently I am wondering why two disks died, too.
Sincerly,
Nico
