If you think that having a common firmware interface for any kind of
device for 2.5 is unrealistic, then this is going to be a very short
discussion.

In short, I don't care how you do it for 2.4.x.  Do it like the
bluetooth usb drivers do it, that's a good place to start with.  Or do
it like the usb drivers that do firmware download from userspace, that's
also a good way to do this for 2.4.  So for 2.4 you have a lot of
different options on how to do this, _because_ we don't have the
goodness of sysfs and the driver model there.
For 2.5 do it the way I proposed, that way _all_ devices in the kernel
have a single way to have firmware downloaded to them, which will result
in peace and harmony for many years to come, during which we will gaze
thoughtfully back on the anarchistic ways of 2.4 and laugh at how
foolish we were then.
