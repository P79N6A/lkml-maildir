It diverged too much from what's in the kernel since about already 3-4
years.
And I don't think that it's that much better in terms of implementation
style...
Fortunately all those floppy interface iomega streamers are 
physically obsolete by now. Plese notice that ftape4 is using a
different storage format, well this is due to the fact that the
ftape inside the kernel wasn't up to the corresponding standard
(QIO-80)...

floppy.c is indeed one of the best compiler test cases around there.
But personally I would excuse floppy.c a bit becouse it's dealing with
a really awkward controller interface ;-).
serial.c should be hooked at the misc char device interface sooner or
later.
But somehow this never happened becouse nobody dared to care enough.
