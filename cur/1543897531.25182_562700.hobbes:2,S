Well, the above has two bugs that sparse could notice _independently_ of 
variable-sized arrays:
 - assignment outside of a function
 - variable size array that isn't an automatic variable
(strictly speaking, that's not even a variable size - it's a constant 2, 
just with a non-constant expression - maybe you misread the "=" as an 
"==")
