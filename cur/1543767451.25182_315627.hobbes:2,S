Have to admit, I'm always hitting the kernel.org one, because that's the
URL that Andrew puts in the announcements.  Probably a lot of others do
so as well - so figure if half the people bother using a mirror rather
than just going clicky-click, the kernel.org logs will reflect the other
half.  Probably not perfect, but probably good enough to tell how many
digits are in the number at least.
(I'll go out on a limb and say "barely 3 digit's worth of downloads")...
