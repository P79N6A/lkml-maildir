As I understand it, the mmiowb on the shub waits only for the PIO write
to be accepted by the destination node (shub or tio) that the I/O device
is attached to, thus guaranteeing that no reordering will happen within
the NL.
If the PPB can reorder the write, then mmiowb is not sufficient.  You'd
have to do a readback from a chip register (assuming you can trust the
PPB not to reorder reads and writes), or some other work around I haven't
thought of.
