Subject: 2.5.73 - SCSI hosts order with scsihosts
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

OK, scsihosts has been removed. It was ugly, no doubt.
Could any body explain how can I use other means mentioned in changelog
to force particular scsi hosts ordering. I.e. I want to make sure
my ide-scsi is always host 0 and ppa is always host 1 irrespectively
in which order they were loaded.
Said changelog:
	This feature is seriously racy, and doesn't work under many
	circumstances.  As we have proper ways to find devices by their
	their locical naming (UUID, fs label) or physical connectivity
	(scsidev, sysfs) it shouldn't be nessecary anymore.
Thank you
