The card is a 3CCFE575BT-D. Under 2.4 with Hinds' pcmcia-cs modules,
the driver was called 3c575_cs. Under 2.6 with the kernel drivers,
only 3c574_cs exists. I assumed that 3c574_cs would also support the
3c575_cs, but I guess I am wrong.
A 3CCFE574BT works just fine with 574_cs (although upon removal,
ifconfig will hang in the 'D' state forever. I guess that's
a separate issue though. I will research this and post another time.

Interesting. Well, I do not have 3c59x compiled in the kernel.
I shall do this and find out.
