Is that really a good idea?
* someone could set sndbuf > 131kB.
* what about the other protocols? 
I thought about failing sock_alloc_send_skb() for skb data blocks > 131
kB.
Btw, is there a definition what wmem_max and sk->sndbuf should do?
The code is really weird:
* sk->sndbuf is initialized to wmem_default, but sock_setsockopt() sets
sk->sndbuf to 2*the user supplied number.
* the unix stream implementation writes blocks of at most sndbuf/2.
* unix_writable() divides sndbuf/4.
* sock_wmalloc() allows one allocation past sk->sndbuf.
