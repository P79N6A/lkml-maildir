Subject: [PATCH] Add missing tvaudio try_to_freeze.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi.
The .c gives Gerd Knorr as the maintainer of this file, but no email
address. The MAINTAINERS file doesn't have his name or make it clear who
owns the file. I haven't therefore been able to cc the maintainer.
Tvaudio lacks a refrigerator call. This patch fixes that.
Regards,
Nigel
