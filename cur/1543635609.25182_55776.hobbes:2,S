That' ridiculous - there's quite a lot of interest in having a
comprehensive system trace capability. The OLS RAS BoF confirmed that. This
sort of capability is essential for system serviceability. Talk to any
Service Engneer who has to deal with real-word non-recreatable problems,
which are nevertheless of enormous impact to a customer.
I would accept that LTT doesn't yet have all the desired features, but
those are one the way and this demonstates a definite interest in LTT.
Also, LTT is currently or about to be distributed in the Monta Vista's
carrier grade offering, Lineo and TurboLinux's enterprise server offering.
There's also a strong possibility that it will end up in United  Linux 1.0
-  no interest? I don't think so.
