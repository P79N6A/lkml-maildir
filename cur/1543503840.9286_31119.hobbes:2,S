Not on a MIDI interface without hardware timing... And still, that
doesn't help if you want software MIDI routing.

I guees not then! :-) Those OSes are about as far as you can get from
the right thigh for native processing.

Not without a real time kernel that runs the whole system as a low
priority task. This is what RTLinux does, but as those solutions have to
do it without modifying the OS code, they have performance problems...
Besides, most of those solutions are VERY expensive.

Frankly, after seeing how some of them (mis)use hard drives and other
system resources, I begin to wonder...

Obviously, there are problems that can't be solved without hacking true
real time support into the kernels. And besides, what about the drivers?
Unless the drivers run in RT context as well, you're screwed from the
start, no matter what you do. I think that's the whole problem. A real
time kernel won't help much.

Probably not, as it's a proprietary system. (You'll have to pay A LOT to
get the docs, if at all possible, if they're like the rest...) However,
I'm pretty sure their code doesn't run without any form of OS.

Would pthreads do? That's the new API of RTL... I'm working on a method
to move drivers to an API that makes the usable both to Linux and RTL
using the same code. Victor Yodaiken is thinking about my suggestions...
Remains to see when and what, but something will be done here. Provided
your real time code is really designed by the rules, it may pretty soon
be a quite simple job porting stuff to RTL, and use the drivers just as
from user space.
