Sorry, but that's not how it works.
He who writes the code decides what it is. In this case, if the kernel 
does a new extension, it's the kernel that gets to decide what it is. 
Full stop.
If glibc wants to do something new, go wild. The kernel won't care.
And that's really the fundamental issue. The kernel does not care what
user land does. The kernel exports functionality, the kernel does _not_
ask user land to help.
That _does_ make it a one-way street. Sorry.
