Hey there!!
fails to boot here with this friendly oops:
http://oioio.altervista.org/linux/dsc01702.jpg
.config: 
http://oioio.altervista.org/linux/config-2.6.23-mm1-1
2.6.23-rc8-mm2 booted ok but had other problems I haven't reported yet
(no s2ram with mysql running and some net WARNING).
Let's see if .23-mm1 still has those first.
I'm adding Cc: linux-scsi
PS: I'll hardly be able to bisect in the next days... :P
