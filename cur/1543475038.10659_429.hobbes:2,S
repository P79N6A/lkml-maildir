Hi, I have a Western Digital 8.4GB HD that supports UDMA but for some
reason it is not being recognized as an UDMA. Maybe I am not clear on
this, but according to my BIOS (Award 4.51PG PnP) it is detected as an
UDMA drive whereas the other drive I have on the same controller isn't.
I have an Asus SP97-V mother board (which supports UltraDMA/33 IDE)with
the SiS 5598 chipset. Here are the details I get about the drive(s) at
bootup: ( I am using 2.2.0-pre4 UP)
SIS5513: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 09
SIS5513: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xd000-0xd007, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:DMA
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xd008-0xd00f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:DMA
hda: WDC AC38400L, ATA DISK drive
hdb: WDC AC22500L, ATA DISK drive
hdc: WDC AC21200H, ATA DISK drive
hdd: ASUS CD-S340, ATAPI CDROM drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
hda: WDC AC38400L, 8063MB w/256kB Cache, CHS=1027/255/63
hdb: WDC AC22500L, 2441MB w/256kB Cache, CHS=620/128/63
hdc: WDC AC21200H, 1222MB w/128kB Cache, CHS=2484/16/63
hdd: ATAPI 34X CDROM drive, 128kB Cache
Uniform CDROM driver Revision: 2.51
hda is a UDMA as well as the cdrom drive hdd. I couldn't find any info
on this on the net so maybe someone could explain why it doesn't seem to
recognize the drive as UDMA for me. 
Thanks for your time
Eric
