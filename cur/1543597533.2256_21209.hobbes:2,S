Heh.

The point with "CLONE_THREAD" is to create a sibling that is a more
"traditional" thread in the sense that it is more identical to the
original clonee - sharing the same thread group etc, so that we can
implement full POSIX pthreads semantics.
HOWEVER, the bug you hit is because CLONE_THREAD also implies
CLONE_PARENT, and the fork() code didn't actually enforce this. So
instead of your patch, we just should not allow the parent and the child
to be in the same thread group. Suggested real patch appended. Does this
fix it for you too?
Thanks,
		Linus
