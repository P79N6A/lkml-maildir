Hi,
Okay, I reproduced it with tg3 on 2.6.0-test11 as well, by turning on
TSO with ethtool.  So it does seem to be an incompatibility between TSO
& conntrack.

But, if netfilter needs to see all the contents in order to function,
shouldn't TSO break other parts of netfilter as well?  Why is only
conntrack affected?

This "un-TSO"ing more or less defeats the purpose of TSO, right?

If that is the case, I suppose so.
Thanks,
