I dont really know, I dont think its possible to get higher then that from a 
5400 RPM disk. Heres mine,
FUJITSU 40.9GB MPG3409AT 5400 RPM
/dev/hda:
Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  7.96 seconds =  8.04 MB/sec
/dev/hda:
Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  7.07 seconds =  9.05 MB/sec
/dev/hda:
Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  6.70 seconds =  9.55 MB/sec
Seems pretty normal to me. However yours is alot better then mine.
