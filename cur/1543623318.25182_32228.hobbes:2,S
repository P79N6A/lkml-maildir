Yes, but that's a performance issue, not a correctness one.
Also, as soon as we have journals on external devices, this whole
thing changes entirely.  We still have to enforce the commit ordering
in the journal, but we also still need the ordering between that
commit and any subsequent writeback, and that obviousy can no longer
be achieved via ordered tags if the two writes are happening on
different devices.
