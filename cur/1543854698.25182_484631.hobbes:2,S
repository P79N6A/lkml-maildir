Nope.

This is one of those low-priority background activities.  Not worth
a lot of fuss.
I'd suggest that you proceeed with the original cleanups you were
proposing, except use `struct kmem_cache' in header files rather than
kmem_cache_t in .c files.
Then, as a separate and later exercise someone (maybe you) can raise
patches to do the kmem_cache_t->kmem_cache conversion.  They should go
through maintainers hence they should be appropriately split and they will
take months to all get to mainline.  Once this is all completed we can remove the
typedef.
