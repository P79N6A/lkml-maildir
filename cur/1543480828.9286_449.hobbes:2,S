There's a recent version at 
http://www.imladris.demon.co.uk/pcsp/
I haven't updated it for the latest kernels, because there were important
changes in the timer code, and I'm going to have to play silly buggers with 
switching timer ticks to the RTC before I can fix it properly.
However, it still works - I suspect it just mucks up the timer accuracy while 
it's being used. So I've put the code I'm currently using on there, called 
patch-pcsp-soundcore-2.2.0-pre8-testing1
There should be a proper patch available for 2.2, and I hope that it'll be 
included in 2.3 eventually.
