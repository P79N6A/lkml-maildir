Out of curiosity, who maintains sh64?
It has a couple irq handlers that have not been updated since the Oct 
2006 update that changed every irq handler in the kernel:
arch/sh64/kernel/dma.c:static irqreturn_t dma_mte(int irq, void *dev_id, 
struct pt_regs *regs)
arch/sh64/kernel/dma.c:static irqreturn_t dma_err(int irq, void *dev_id, 
struct pt_regs *regs)
