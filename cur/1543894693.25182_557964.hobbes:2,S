Yes.  If I cut a book in half and store the halves separately, does
the second half become an independent work?  The integral-ness is a
function of how the thing is created and how it functions, not how it
is stored.  If you need part B for part A to execute as intended, then
part A is not a complete work in itself.  On top of this, in the Tivo
case the two are distributed together, and even part of the same file.

The GPL does not require a distributor to provide me with any kind of
environment.  If I get a Tivo kernel image but do not have a Tivo, the
GPL does not require anyone to give me hardware.  Fortunately, that is
not at all my argument.
