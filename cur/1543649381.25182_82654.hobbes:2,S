I would vote for simplicity and would normally agree with you here. But
it seems to me that using RCU, you can avoid atmic operations
and cache line bouncing of calling_nmi_handlers in the fast path
(nmi interrupt handler). One could argue whether it is really
a fast path or not, but if you are using it for profiling, I would
say it is. No ?
