Amen.

If you update, pci_msi_{enable,supported} then you can -- and should -- 
revert the HD-audio driver change.  Just reviewed the driver, and it 
properly checks all the return values from PCI MSI API functions.
(though, HD-audio shouldn't be using IRQF_DISABLED at all, and shouldn't 
be using IRQF_SHARED for PCI MSI interrupts)
Though maybe for 2.6.19 the current state of things is at least a stable 
state.
