Ive also had the same problem with both 2.6.19.2 and 2.6.20-rcX,
motherboard is gigabyte ga-965-ds3 , the networking stops completely
under moderate traffic, I get the following errors or a complete
lockup:
Jan 21 02:08:04 beast NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
Jan 21 02:08:04 beast sky2 eth0: tx timeout
Jan 21 02:08:04 beast sky2 eth0: transmit ring 475 .. 452 report=475 done=475
Jan 21 02:08:04 beast sky2 hardware hung? flushing
At the time I was downloading a iso image at 850k/sec, so not really a
high network load at all.
rmmod / modprobe does resolve the issue, but more times than not the
box locks up completely instead of getting those errors.
