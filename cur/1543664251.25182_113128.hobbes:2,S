If you netboot /etc as its own filesystem make sense.  Why
duplicate the rest of root just for /etc.  /etc, /var and
/tmp are the only filesystems that have much reason to be
unique to a system; all others are easily sharable and most
others read-only.

/etc/mtab is a hack.  I suspect it was done so that fsck, df
and umount wouldn't have to read /dev/kmem.  We now have
much better ways to get data out of the kernel.
The idea of storing the list of mounted filesystems on a
mounted filesystem is a bad idea from the get-go.  The only
advantage it ever really had was the possibility to manually
play mountpoint monte with mv.  Duplicating the in-kernel
data externally begs for inconsistencies that only get worse
with pivot root.
Let the data reside in the kernel and have a procfs or sysfs
entity for it.  A symlink from /etc/mtab can keep the old
tools happy.
