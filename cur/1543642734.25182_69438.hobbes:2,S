I can't confirm that. Yes, IBM failed, Fujitsu is often IBM, DEC isn't any 
better either. But Western... I'm still having some quite old Western 
drives, aged several years, a lot more than they guaranteed. They still 
run our old database, and are used in some workstations. Some of them 
touched ground more than once, and are still running like the cursed. No 
need for an end. Then there are these ST-157A, stable as rocks, still 
running here. You can even crash them on up to 60G's, if not more!!! That 
is, they can stand falling down very well.
In the while, there were two to three broken Maxtor disks. Their spindles  
broke after two years, so the data was physically moved upwards. We've 
returned them and got another disk in return, no problem.
