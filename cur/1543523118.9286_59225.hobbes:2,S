99 is a lot better. Its worthless for real traffic studies because real traffic
its lots of slow connections (which bizarrely enough tends to be harder
than a small number of fast ones). specweb96 is a bit comical, its the
bogomips of web benches, 99 tells you some truths about your cgi performance

It depends on your server. Apache is really easy to degrade badly, thttpd
performs materially better under extreme load. Do your tests with both apache
and thttpd (www.acme.com)
I think the comparison is probably the interesting part for showing how 
degradation is app dependant
