That is a sign of movement. Sure, one can argue if it is random movement of
definite progress, but change /is/ a part of innovation.

In-kernel API was /never/ guaranteed, so you have nothing to complain here.

They do get it, and have their reasons to act this way. Reasons you don't
get, it seems.

They do care. But not about the same thing you care about.

It is /their/ code, with which they are free to do as they wish. If you
contribute enough, you get a say in it too; until that time, just be
grateful for what you get given freely.

Licensing under GPL while "maintaining control" is a contradiction in
terms. If you don't like where the development is going, you are free to
fork it. Just the developers won't follow you, as the consensus between
them is against your wishes.

I have programs written in the early 80s that still can be compiled and run
on Linux. And AFAIK the very first a.out binaries for Linux still work (I'd
assume that setting up the shared libraries for them is a royal pain).
I have programs by /Microsoft/ which don't run after Win98, even though
they are supposed to run on later versions. 
Besides, this backward compatibility is exactly one of the major reasons
for Windows breakage, they just can't get a clean cut from the past.

For user programs? Sure is.

So?

Could you please give some kind of evidence for this misbehaviour by IBM?

Right. Their only loyalty is to a better kernel (system). Nothing
else. Nobody /ever/ promised anything else, in fact, they have /always/
stated that that is their only objective. You definitely haven't gotten
shafted.

This is what distributions do routinely... and the current development
model is precisely to /disminish/ the cost of keeping up to date by third
parties. In that sense the kernel community /does/ care for them, just that
they don't make any promises. Take it or leave it. There are alternatives,
like the various BSD flavors. Or even Solaris, or closed Unix variants.
