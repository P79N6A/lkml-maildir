I've never seen one, I'd like to look at those if you've got them. Are you
sure it's the actual machine code that returns buffers, and not an implicit
return of the interpreter?

I don't really seem to follow: my logic checks for ACPI_TYPE_STRING, and if
not found, looks at DSDT signatures. If something different than a string
is returned by INIT _and_ the machine isn't a P30/P35 (DSDT sigs) then the
defaults are set as in every other case a machine is not recognized by the
driver.

The original driver behaviour was: ( if INIT returns NULL && DSDT sigs
match ) machine is a P30. My patch changes that to ( if INIT returns
!ACPI_TYPE_STRING && DSDT sigs match ) machine is a P30. I'd like to see
those reports please.
