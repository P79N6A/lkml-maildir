This was the model for development kernels, and it's usable for 
development kernels.
The problem is that 28 MB in 9 weeks are 3 MB of changes every week.
With such a weekly model, I fear the weekly kernels would be of very 
varying quality and never fully stable. Up to 2.4, kernel.org kernels 
were usually a good choice, but with such a model the only usable 
kernels in production environments will be distribution kernels that 
will contain the mixture of at least three "stable" kernel for getting a 
usable kernel.
