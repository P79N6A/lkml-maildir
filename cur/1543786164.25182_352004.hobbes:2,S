I glanced at the manual. Uhh, DataFlash is very specific beast. It 
suppoers page program with built-in erase command... So DataFlash 
effectively may be considered as a block device. Then you may use any FS 
on it providing you have wrote proper driver? Why do you need JFFS2 then 
:-) ?
JFFS2 orients to "classical" flashes. They have no "write page with 
built-in erase" operation.
Didn't read the manual carefully, what do they refer by "Main memory array"?
BTW, having 8*1056 write buffer is not perfect ides, better make it as 
small as possible, i.e., 1056 bytes.
