While playing with routing (zebra) and PPP I regularly see this
message appearing. It always happens when pppd terminates a connection,
e.g:
Dec  3 23:09:08 mimas pppd[784]: Modem hangup
Dec  3 23:09:08 mimas pppd[784]: Connection terminated.
Dec  3 23:09:08 mimas pppd[784]: Connect time 2.0 minutes.
Dec  3 23:09:08 mimas pppd[784]: Sent 499 bytes, received 977 bytes.
Dec  3 23:09:08 mimas pppd[822]: Hangup (SIGHUP)
Dec  3 23:09:08 mimas kernel: waitpid(823) failed, -512
Dec  3 23:09:08 mimas pppd[784]: Hangup (SIGHUP)
Dec  3 23:09:08 mimas pppd[784]: Exit.
The (incoming) PPP connection is tunnelled through a telnet connection so
there are some other processes involved.
On the outgoing side (other system also running 2.4.0-test11) I sometimes
see the same message, e.g:
Nov 29 23:37:08 iapetus pppd[1777]: Connection terminated.
Nov 29 23:37:08 iapetus pppd[1777]: Connect time 2.5 minutes.
Nov 29 23:37:08 iapetus pppd[1777]: Sent 85 bytes, received 87 bytes.
Nov 29 23:37:08 iapetus pppd[1777]: Exit.
Nov 29 23:37:08 iapetus kernel: waitpid(1857) failed, -512
