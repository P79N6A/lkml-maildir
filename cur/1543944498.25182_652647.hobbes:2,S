I've run allmodconfig builds on a bunch of target, FWIW (essentially the
same patch).  Note that these includes are recent addition caused by
added inline function that had since then become a define.  So while I
agree with your comments in general, in _this_ case it's pretty safe.
Commit that had done it is 3062fc67dad01b1d2a15d58c709eff946389eca4
and switch to #define is 60c12b1202a60eabb1c61317e5d2678fcea9893f (BTW,
that warranted mentioning in changelog of the latter).
