I mostly agree ... you can have a pm-stupid driver for a given device,
or a very smart one, and they might need to expose different PM models
through any /sys/devices/.../power/state type files.
My disagreement is with the assumption that none of those states
will ever map directly to bus states.  (For those busses which define
them; not all do, but PCI does.)  Or perhaps with the assumption
that the driver must not name its states after the bus states they
use, even in common scenarios without one-to-many confusions.

Well certainly if the device doesn't implement PCI_D1 in hardware, then
that name shouldn't be used for a driver state.  But if it has only one
driver state that uses PCI_D2, why rule out calling that state PCI_D2?
Lots of PCI drivers don't even try to subdivide the PCI states, so every
driver state directly corresponds to one PCI state.
The PCI state semantics are well enough defined, but as I recall you want
device-specific details going beyond what the spec covers.  That is a
rather different issue.

And it would be less confusing to name those "suspended" levels with
names that make sense on multiple levels, like "PCI_D2" etc, than to
needlessly proliferate other names for those states.

Depends on the mechanism, surely.  And "PCI_D2" is already in that
language-neutral "doesn't get translation" category anyway.  Regardless,
userspace tools should just compare tokens.

I consider all those issues orthogonal to the issues addressed by
the /sys/devices/.../power/state files:  (a) reporting the power
state the driver is currently maintaining, and (b) changing that
to another state supported by that driver.
