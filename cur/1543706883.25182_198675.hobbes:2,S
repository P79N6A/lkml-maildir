I wasn't making myself clear, it seems.
The hdX= construct applies to the entire ide subsystem, which for the vast
majority of people means it has to be specified at boot time, as ide is
compiled in.
If we were to have an ide-scsi module option to tell it which hdX units to
attach to, that would be more flexible than having to tell ide, since I can
then rmmod/insmod ide-scsi if I want to change my mind, whereas I must reboot
if I need to change what I tell ide.
The advantage of the hdX ide parameter is that it applies to the entire ide 
subsystem, and therefor influences ide-cd, ide-scsi, ide-tape.
The main reason I see for sticking with the hdX= construct is that I think
that introducing competing mechanisms that achieve much the same objective
is a bad thing.
