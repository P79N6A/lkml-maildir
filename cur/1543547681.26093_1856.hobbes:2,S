Hello All,
    I have a box with 2 ethernet cards.  One is a ne2k-pci and one is a 
tulip.  Under 2.2.X the ne card is eth0 and the tulip is eth1.  Unfortunatly
if I boot a 2.4.X kernel, the tulip card is assigned eth0 and the ne card
eth1, which of course breaks all my networking setup scripts.  I can get
the 2.4.X kernels to assign 2.2.X identities by using command line args
like (from memory):
    ethers=eth1
but unfortunatly at least one of the cards does not work if I try this.
I "solved" the problem by using kernel modules and an /etc/modules.conf
file that looks like this:
    alias eth0 ne2k-pci 
    alias eth1 tulip
but I would really rather not use a modular kernel.  I have no idea what I
would do if I had two identical network cards in the computer.  Is there
a better way to solve this problem?
Thanks,
Jim
