	Dirty inodes treatment ;-/ So they'ld better *be* cached, but they
can be stored in a separate list.

OK, fine with me - we'll always be able to enforce uniqueness later. Not
that hard to do it from the very beginning, but if you are fine without
it... I'ld simply use inode->i_ino = (ino_t)inode, but it will break on
64-bit architectures. BTW, inodes are allocated from one cache. If
slab code provides something like in-cache ID... I didn't read through
mm/slab.c yet, so it's a wild speculation, indeed.

It's unfsd that makes me worry...
