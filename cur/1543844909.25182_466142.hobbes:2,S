For old stuff - to a high degree yes.

It makes it fatter on the horizontal level - yes.
But then files do not rely on files being included by asm-* files
anymore - so less difference between architecutes.

That would be wrong. Any file in asm-* that needs a file from linux/
should pull that include to the linux/ counterpart and in this way
we are on track again.
It boils down to something simple as:
Do we want to keep arch independence lower on the price of higher number
includes in asm- counter part files in linux/?

No.
There is a huge difference modifying architecture independent code like
infiniband or module.c and to try to clean up headers.
Cleaning up headers really really require that one cross compile
a lot no matter how files are organized.

They are easy to explain: They are there to keep arch independence lower -
and the cost is a number (tons?) of extra includes.
OK - this was a fun thread talking about arch specific includes.
But since I do not plan to follow-up with patches I will
drop of for now. bugzilla and others tell me I should concentrate
on other things.
