Working on that, some new code in my personal CVS now - but I suspect it
will be the weekend before that gets fully fixed.

Actually, the two macros INIT_WORK and PREPARE_WORK use the same work
queue but ask it to schedule the execution of two different (if very
similar) functions start_spu_dma() - which does the initial transfer and
more_spu_dma - which tops up the dma transfers.
So I think I've got that right.
