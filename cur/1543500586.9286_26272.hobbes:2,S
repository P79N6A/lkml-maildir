Why must they appear as files to the user? I don't see quite what is very wrong
with having a complex document as a directory.
If they must indeed be files, what kind of structure is supposed to be provided
by the OS? It seems that there are very few things that _all_ applications
would want to be in there, no? All I can think of is an icon and the mime type
of the file. Even the icon would probably be deducible from the mime type.
(Storing the name of the executable that is used to open the document is IMHO
wrong. There are too many different places that an executable might live, and
there are too many different executables that might be used to open a single
file type. Eg do you use gimp, xv, or electric eye to open a JPEG file?)
