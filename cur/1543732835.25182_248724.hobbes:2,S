Actually the handleing of special filesystem features in the OS is an
OLD idea.  VMS is actually not more modern than Unix, it is older than
Unix owing much to earlier OS's such as RSX-11.  It was a great insight
on the part of Ritche and Thompson that the kernel should present a file
as a byte stream and that the interpretation of the contents of a file
is the province of the application, not the operating system.
Now it maybe, that there are features that can only be provided by
adding support in the kernel, but we should be very careful not to be
distracted by what we see as new wizbang features.  The filesystem as a
database has been tried before, ISAM is a very old concept.
