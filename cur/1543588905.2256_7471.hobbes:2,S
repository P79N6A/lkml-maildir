Ummm, no.
As I said, I first cleaned everything out with mrproper, and then went through
the options in order.  Since the alternative UHCI driver does not occur until
after the question for the normal UHCI driver in drivers/usb/Configure.in, it
never asked me the question of building the normal UHCI driver.  I just
verified that if I use make xconfig instead of make menuconfig, I will be able
to choose either driver (yes, if you choose one as builtin, it won't allow you
to choose the other, but I'm talking about building them as modules, and the
initial selection after make mrproper is done).
