I think spurious usermode faults are already dealt with.  
handle_pte_fault() does essentially the same thing as this patch:
	if (ptep_set_access_flags(vma, address, pte, entry, write_access)) {
		update_mmu_cache(vma, address, entry);
	} else {
		/*
		 * This is needed only for protection faults but the arch code
		 * is not yet telling us if this is a protection fault or not.
		 * This still avoids useless tlb flushes for .text page faults
		 * with threads.
		 */
		if (write_access)
			flush_tlb_page(vma, address);
	}
