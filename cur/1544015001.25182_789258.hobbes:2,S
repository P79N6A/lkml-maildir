Depending on the implementation details, the use of such a struct might be
relying on implementation-specific behaviour.  This is what
Documentation/DMA-API.txt has to say:
[...]
int
dma_get_cache_alignment(void)
Returns the processor cache alignment.  This is the absolute minimum
alignment *and* width that you must observe when either mapping
memory or doing partial flushes.
Notes: This API may return a number *larger* than the actual cache
line, but it will guarantee that one or more cache lines fit exactly
into the width returned by this call.  It will also always be a power
of two for easy alignment.
[...]
Since dma_get_cache_alignment() is a function not a constant its result
can't be used in the definition of a struct unless possibly excessive
padding is used.
The debate has shown that we problably need BUG_ON() assertions in the
DMA API implementations to catch this sort of dangerous use.
