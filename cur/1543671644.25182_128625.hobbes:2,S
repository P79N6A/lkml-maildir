I agree, and understand what you are doing, it makes sense for your
case.  Just wanted to make sure you were aware of the future danger :)

Ok, that works for me.  Does the patch below work out for you?

Yes, generalizing that stuff would be nice to have.  Lots of drivers
have to manage their urbs on their own today, and making that easier to
do would be a good thing.
