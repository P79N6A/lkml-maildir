Yes, I am well aware of that issue.  As for the connection tracking
table or the dstlimit htables I was referring to, I am actually relating
'pos' to the bucket number, not to the logical entry in the table.
The number of hash buckets is constant, so that's at least something the
user can count on.
However, there will be a problem when there are too many entries within
a single bucket - since all of them would have to be returned within a
single read() call.
