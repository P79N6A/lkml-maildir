EDAC currently presents a common interface for harvesting the number of
CEs (and other data) that occur AND maps to a DIMM label, which can be
populated to a mobo silk screen label.  This is via the sysfs interface.
Currently each of the MC drivers some of their output error messages in
their own pattern of output, while also funnelling common info to the
core module.  We don't want to lose that device specific information,
but it would be a better pattern to funnel that device specific output
to the EDAC Core module for presentation in a more uniforum manner,
through the new sysfs interface, such as:
/sys/drivers/system/edac/mc/mc_driver_error_report
or some such.
The EDAC stack is like a SCSI stack:  A core module and a lower level
instance driver.
We want to move some of the information that is currently being dumped
via printk() to the sysfs interface. Some not all.
The message that is being printed now that caused this post, just prints
some MC specific information, but not quite enough to be of real use.
It is extra noise, which needs to be examined in depth, to form a clean
error stack.
New MC drivers are in the works. New MC chipsets are coming down the
line and I don't want to have each driver output its OWN output that
proves more difficult to "harvest" over time, because each driver writer
does it his way.
EDAC is not perfect enough yet, but with time and more refactoring it
will approach there.
