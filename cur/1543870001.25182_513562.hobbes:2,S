I have some additional information coming from more testing and I also
CC'd linux-ide and Jeff Garzik.
Original message (with BUG) can be found here:

I'm using my distro's modular kernel (ArchLinux).  The 2.6.19.x kernels
from the distro also have the problem.  However, Knoppix 5.1.1 which
ships with 2.6.19.1 detects all the drives on sata_sil controllers
without errors, and PLD linux live rescue CD (2.6.19.2) detects 2 of the
3 currently connected, the third is just absent, no BUG like when using
Arch.
I noticed Knoppix had sata_sil=y, so I tried building it in as well with
the same BUG results.
My .config (distro standard) can be found here:

I will be happy to test/provide more information on request.
Thanks again,
Dale
