I should clarify - 8-}  
I am using bzImage. I get the following errors that are all related to the
fact that the kernel size is > 1 Meg.
Root device is (8, 1)
Boot sector 512 bytes.
Setup is 3440 bytes.
System is 1036 kB
System is too big. Try using modules.
make[1]: *** [bzImage] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory
`/mnt/micropolis2/src/linux.2312/arch/i386/boot'
make: *** [bzImage] Error 2
Anyone know a fix? I know that some previous debate had raged about
bzImage should be able to handle up to 16M kernel sizes but have found no
data/patches/etc on what to do to get past 1M.
