...and not much else. So in essence we have a port for which there is an
incomplete kernel made available (oooh shock horror if only this were
true a little bit less often) and no useful information given away about
how they actually build the thing. I await their update.
I reckon it is only a matter of a bit of the festivities and some
whiskey before I get a screwdriver and have a play with mine[0].
Jon.
