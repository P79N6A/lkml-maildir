That's true, but PPC_MULTIPLATFORM (in old speak) was also the boring
case.  The problem with ripping it out is there's always a reliance on
things the kernel knows anyhow (serial is here, something else we need
to kick is there, and so on).  Not that it couldn't be duplicated
elsewhere, but it would be duplication.
