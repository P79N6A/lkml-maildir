Hello all,
What can be called aio-0.3.7 is now released.  It consists of 
libaio-0.3.7.tar plus the aio-20020123 patchset (provided for both 
rh-2.4.9 and 2.4.18-pre3).   Note that the 2.4.18-pre3 patchset 
is completely untested, but it looked right and I seem to do okay 
at merging patches usually...  Bug reports and comments welcome.
