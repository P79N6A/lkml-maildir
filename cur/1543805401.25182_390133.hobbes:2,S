Actually no, I see that #1 is unnecessary, and already acknowledged as such

But #2 still holds.

See the Mutex Initialization Scheduling Attributes section which 
specifically addresses priority inversion:
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/xrat/xsh_chap02.html#tag_03_02_09
If point #2 were not true, then there would be no need to bother with 
any of that. Instead that text ends with "it is important that 
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 provide these interfaces for those cases in which 
it is necessary."
