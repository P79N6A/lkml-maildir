It uses 16M of course. Like I said before:

The CONFIG_PAGE_SHIFT allows you to ship a "monster" kernel for db
usage with hundred gigs of ram, with 64k page size and 64k blocksize,
getting the whole advantages. We of course must make sure that
CONFIG_PAGE_SHIFT=12 doesn't provide any slowdown.
Then us mere mortals will enjoy running with 8k page size too, with
our 2-4G of ram. I used 8k page size with an alpha workstation back in
2000 and I didn't feel any substantial ram waste, I had about 2G of
ram. Ok, now the kernel is larger, but even git learnt using packs ;)
