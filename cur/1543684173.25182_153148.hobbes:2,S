Some minor comments:
	- read Documentation/CodingStyle and apply it to your code.
	- fix up the usages of the MOD_* functions.  Get rid of the ones
	  for the file_ops and have the core increment the count of the
	  drivers before the core calls them.
	- please do not use ioctls.  They are hell for 64bit kernels.
	  Use either a filesystem for your subsystem, or sysfs.
	- try doing this for 2.6 first if you want any chance at all to
	  get it into the main kernel trees.
Good luck,
greg k-h
