Hi Matthieu, Matthew
I fixed lots of "mucking directly" with scsi_cmnd and scsi_eh_save
internal members but the actual set of srb->cmnd{,_len} is needed
still. Though we don't need the copy since we restore the original
command right after. If anyone can test this to verify it could
be grate.
Sorry for the mishap
Boaz

Subject: [PATCH] fix USB_STORAGE_CYPRESS_ATACB
commit 64a87b24: [SCSI] Let scsi_cmnd->cmnd use request->cmd buffer
changed the scsi_eh_prep_cmnd logic by making it clear
the ->cmnd buffer. But the sat to cypress atacb translation supposed
the ->cmnd buffer wasn't modified.
This patch makes it set the ->cmnd buffer after scsi_eh_prep_cmnd call.
The problem and a fix was reported by Matthieu CASTET <castet.matthieu@free.fr>
It also removes all the hackery fiddling of scsi_cmnd and scsi_eh_save by
requesting from scsi_eh_prep_cmnd to prepare a read into ->sense_buffer,
which is much more suitable a buffer for HW transfers, then after the command
execution the regs read is copied into regs buffer before actual preparation
of sense_buffer.
Also fix an alien comment character to my utf-8 editor.
