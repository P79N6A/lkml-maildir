This patch does the legacy probe if PNP says we have an SMCf010, but
we couldn't make it work.  In that situation, I think we need a PNP
quirk or other kernel PNP fix.  Ultimately, we should only use the
legacy probe if we don't have PNP at all.  
But we're a long ways from that.  First, we have to figure out how
to make PNP detection work at all, then make sure it works for all
the machines we know about.

So while this patch works, I don't think it's the right long-term
direction.

It's indeed very interesting that pcmcia_socket0 seems to have its
fingers in the same ioport range the IR device thinks it's using.
I don't know much about PCMCIA, but I can see I'm going to have to
learn something :-)
Can you send me your "lspci -vv" output, the whole /proc/ioports and
/proc/iomem, and your dmesg log?  And maybe your pcmcia_socket
available_resources_io and available_resources_mem for good measure.
