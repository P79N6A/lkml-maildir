Not exactly. What I propose is:
- Running slab_alloc and slab_free fast paths in preempt_disable
  context, using cmpxchg_local.
- Running slab_alloc and slab_free slow paths with irqs disabled.
- Running __alloc_pages in preemptible context, not tied to any CPU.
In this scheme, calling __alloc_pages from slab_alloc would reenable
interrupts and potentially migrate us to a different CPU. We would
therefore have to get once again our per-cpu data structure once we get
back into irq disabled code, because we may be running on a different
CPU. This is actually what the __slab_alloc slow path does:
new_slab:
        new = get_partial(s, gfpflags, node);
        if (new) {
                c->page = new;
                goto load_freelist;
        }
        new = new_slab(s, gfpflags, node);
          ----> within new_slab, we can reenable interrupts for the
                __slab_alloc call.
        if (new) {
                c = get_cpu_slab(s, smp_processor_id());
                if (c->page) {
                        /*
                         * Someone else populated the cpu_slab while we
                         * enabled interrupts, or we have gotten scheduled
                         * on another cpu. The page may not be on the
                         * requested node even if __GFP_THISNODE was
                         * specified. So we need to recheck.
                         */
                        if (node_match(c, node)) {
                                /*
                                 * Current cpuslab is acceptable and we
                                 * want the current one since its cache hot
                                 */
                                discard_slab(s, new);
                                slab_lock(c->page);
                                goto load_freelist;
                        }
                        /* New slab does not fit our expectations */
                        flush_slab(s, c);
                }
                slab_lock(new);
                SetSlabFrozen(new);
                c->page = new;
                goto load_freelist;
So the idea would be to split the code in O(1)
preempt_disable/irq_disable sections and to enable interrupt and check
for current per-cpu data structure when re-entering in irq disabled
code.
