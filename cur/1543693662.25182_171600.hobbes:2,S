As well as looking pretty ugly, I can't convince myself this is safe.
I think it's going to be better off making that whole code compile out
if MTRRs are disabled. MTRR is a must-have if we want this code to actually
work anyway.
Either change the ifdef at the top of centaur.c to 
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_OOSTORE && CONFIG_MTRR, or futz around it in the
Kconfig, by changing the X86_OOSTORE depends line to
	depends on (MWINCHIP3D || MWINCHIP2 || MWINCHIPC6) && MTRR
