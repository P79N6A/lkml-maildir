Debian have picked up the module-init-tools, so although they're a bit
lagged as I type this, I expect this to become a less common occurrance.

No, it's finished, it's just not merged 8(.  Testers welcome!  See:

That, in itself, should be harmless.

Wierd.  The PCMCIA scripts make assumptions about layout of
/lib/modules/`uname -r` which was broken by the removal of the
directory hierarchy.  It's not the only thing (mkinitrd also wants
this).  While relying on the layout of the kernel source tree is
broken, no better alternatives have some up, so this is queued to be
reverted once I test that it doesn't break the current tools (which
*should* handle it).
There is a known bug where an *old* rmmod will hang (it has the effect
of "rmmod --wait": I have a patch to differentiate the two
effectively, but it requires everyone to upgrade to 0.9 or above,
which they have probably done by now).

Looking at these files:
idra-usb.c: add "netdev->owner = THIS_MODULE;" and get rid of the
	MOD_INC_USE_COUNT.
irtty-sir.c: The ldisc code needs an owner field, and it needs to use
	it.  Until then, this warning is best left where it is.
af_irda: The caller needs to do something here, too.  Dave?

Well, you can rmmod -f in the meantime.

Hmm the contents of the FAQ are still in flux, which is why it's not
published.   The init stuff is still up for debate.
