Subject: 2.6.0-test4: ACPI breaks IDE/USB

When I enable ACPI on 2.6.0-test4 (also on 2.6.0-test3-*), the kernel no
longer recognises my IDE controller and drops down to PIO mode for
harddisk access. Additionally, USB devices don't get detected.
Running a kernel without ACPI solves both these problems.
The system is an Athlon 2400+ on a Gibabyte GA-7VAXP mainboard. (KT400)
This is from dmesg with ACPI (CONFIG_ACPI=y) enabled:
--
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with
idebus=xx
VP_IDE: IDE controller at PCI slot 0000:00:11.1
VP_IDE: (ide_setup_pci_device:) Could not enable device.
hda: WDC WD800JB-00ETA0, ATA DISK drive

.. and this is with ACPI (# CONFIG_ACPI is not set) disabled:
--
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with
idebus=xx
VP_IDE: IDE controller at PCI slot 0000:00:11.1
VP_IDE: chipset revision 6
VP_IDE: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with
idebus=xx
VP_IDE: VIA vt8235 (rev 00) IDE UDMA133 controller on pci0000:00:11.1
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xd800-0xd807, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xd808-0xd80f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:pio
hda: WDC WD800JB-00ETA0, ATA DISK drive

I'm happily running without ACPI now, but I guess the kernel just
shouldn't be exhibiting the above behaviour. If whomever is fixing this
bug needs more and/or more detailed info, please email me and I'll
provide it.
Cheers,
- Peter.
