Forget to mention:  there's a huge wireless update in there:
   Changes include the new wireless stack, the associated drivers, and
   the new wireless configuration mechanisms, as well as some b44 changes
   related to hardware in-common with bcm43xx.  There are currently over
   700 individual patches in the entire series.  I have the individual
   patches extracted and available here:
