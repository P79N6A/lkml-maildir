That would be more Jens and aviro than I.
My vote would be: just merge the sucker while it still (almost) 
applies. 2TB is a showstopper for some people in 2.4 today.  Obviously
2.6 will need 64-bit block numbers.
The next obstacle will be page cache indices into the blockdev mapping.
That's either an 8TB or 16TB limit, depending on signedness correctness.
One minor point - it is currently not possible to print sector_t's.
This code:
	printk("%lu%s", some_sector, some_string);
will work fine with 32-bit sector_t.  But with 64-bit sector_t it
will generate a warning at compile-time and an oops at runtime.
The same problem applies to dma_addr_t.  Jeff, davem and I kicked
that around a while back and ended up deciding that although there
are a number of high-tech solutions, the dumb one was best:
