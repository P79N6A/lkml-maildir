Please, not again!
Red Hat 7.0's "GCC 2.96" is binary compatible for C with all past and
future versions. It will probably not be binary compatible with C++ for
gcc-3.0. But then again, _none_ of the extant C++ compiler versions are
binary compatible, each needs its own libstdc++, so this is mostly a
non-issue.
