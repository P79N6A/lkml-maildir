Thanks for the diff, that fitted together better.
I spent several hours poring over your report,
but came to no useful conclusions - sorry.
As you probably noticed yourself, struct slab's colouroff and s_mem
have been overwritten by a list_head; but I can't deduce anything
illuminating from that.
Less obvious and more interesting, is that the struct kmem_cache is
being corrupted during the course of the output: it starts off saying
in several places that cachep->num is 11, but ends up printing only
one kmem_bufctl_t (aside from "free"): implying cachep->num 1 by then.
Which may relate to how 11/11 was wrongly in the partial list.
I'd be interested in the signal_cache line from your /proc/slabinfo,
to see what cachep->num is usually in your configuration.  But it's
an idle interest: I won't have anything interesting to say, whatever
it is...
Anyone else?
Hugh
