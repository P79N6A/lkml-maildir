Which, by the way, means that folk with pre-ACPI systems aren't
going to be able to use this driver until someone else provides
an updated patch creating an "rtc_cmos" platform device.
Or on the more modern end of things ... I suspect PCs using
Linux-BIOS won't do PNPACPI either, and they will also need
that platform device before using this driver.
What do the MiniMac systems do?  At one time I thought they
were ACPI-free.
