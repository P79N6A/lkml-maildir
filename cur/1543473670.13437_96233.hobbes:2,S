Subject: 2.2.0pre2 Documentation bug
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/1998/12/31/190

The processor type selection in 2.2.0pre2 is out of sync with its docs
(The ones you get when selecting ?, or Help in menuconfig).
Choices are
 386
 486/Cx486
 586/K5/5x86/6x86
     ^^
 Pentium/TSC
 PPro/K6/6x86MX
      ^^
But the help tells people, among other things, to use Pentium/TSC for the
K6, and Pentium/TSC for the K5.
