Will the person with the phony IP address of 192.9.106.2 please
stop trying to log in as root on this machine. FYI, root is not
'root' on this machine. On this machine, root is 100.100 which
won't do you much good unless you just want to read my linux-kernel
mail.
'root' is used to filter spam. Most spammer code ignores accounts
like root, postmaster, ftp, etc.
Sorry about the bandwidth. My log-files were getting big.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
