I have had the same problems once and could add the following to your story:
    X crashed randomly (and hard)
    it worked under win 95/NT but as long as the ne2k-pci and the AGP card
shared IRQs the performance was really low (I noticed this whilst bench
marking the graphics card)
My solution was putting the things on different IRQs.
