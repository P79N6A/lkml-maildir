Yeah, I saw a pretty good correlation between OOM killing and 
all_unreclaimable.
We've got some code to spit that out during an OOM kill now, so that 
might be
helpful.

I had a patch that caused try_to_free_pages to ignore all_unreclaimable and
go 'round the loop again if we reached oom-kill conditions. Basically that
guarantees you'll scan ~ pages_present*2 before going OOM. I think it may
be a good thing to do, but I wasn't really able to reproduce these early
OOM killings.
