Yes. I've heard a couple of the Sun engineers bemoan the 'soft' mount
option and state that it should never have been invented...
Normally if the partition is soft mounted, an NFS operation is allowed
to fail upon the first major timeout and will send the '-EIO' error
back to the application.
If you are using soft mounts, and are not checking the read/write
errors, then that is indeed a bug in your program...
Cheers,
