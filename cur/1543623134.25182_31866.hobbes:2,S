Hmmm, not finding any "Joe Barr" in the last few weeks of l-k. Let's
see about google. From Joe Barr's annual Linux predictions on
linuxworld....

Oh. Hi.
Sorry I didn't recognize you. I spend more time trying to write the future
than reading about it. Or rather, I tend to read about the future in old
sourcecode. Like this bizarre thing dmr just sent me; ed.bun, which
appears to be a Plan 9 "bundle" of 3 V5 UNIX assembly source files for ed.
Plan 9 "bundle" appears to be a sed script. ed, bundled by the streamable
version of ed. Of course, for all I know Plan 9 sed is really streamable
sam. It's surely UTF-8. Welcome to the future.
Relax. I don't see my stuff screwing up any of your predictions any time
soon. However, if you want to see my most futuristic flakey untenable
stuff, sticking my own 3-stack Forth in the Linux kernel is nothing. Have
a look at
        URL: 
ftp://linux01.gwdg.de/pub/cLIeNUX/descriptive/membership
and the other oddities in that directory. They are my non-technical side,
to the extent that I have such a thing.
So, on the "one bad joke deserves another" tack you established via email,
it's your turn.
