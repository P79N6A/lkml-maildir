Well, back online now pretty late ;-)
Yes, as was already reported I can also confirm from testing the deadlock 
is gone now. Thanks for resolving this issue!
Just a minor question before the thread gets closed: Don't we have the 
same problem in the register path? register_netdevice is running unter 
rtnl and calls netdev_register_sysfs. I've never seen a deadlock there, 
but I'd expect this to sleep for hotplug usermode completion as well.
Maybe this is just what you meant by your comment above ;-)
