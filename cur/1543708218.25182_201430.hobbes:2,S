   You don't say what make of disk these are. It may be that you've
fallen foul of the Seagate/SiI erratum, which (as far as I can tell)
still kills performance. I have a 120GiB Seagate disk attached to a
SiI3112 controller, and I'm lucky if I get 12MiB/s with the IDE-layer
driver. I haven't tried the libata driver yet.
   I'm not too worried about that set-up, because I don't need massive
performance off that disk anyway, but something faster might be
nice. :)
   Hugo.
