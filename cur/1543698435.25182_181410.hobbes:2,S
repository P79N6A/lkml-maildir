Yes, I can confirm that. With 1006, I could run 2.4.22-ac4 sometimes
for minutes, sometimes for several hours (2.6 however crashed right
away almost every time while still booting). With 1007, 2.4.22-ac4 is
also unstable.

Well, I tried everything with my hardware. Removing all cards,
disabling all onboard devices in BIOS setup etc... the only thing that
I didn't try yet was disabling the IDE controller, since I need the
PATA controller for booting.

Yes, you're right. Additionally, it's also very interesting that, at
least with BIOS 1006, 2.4.22-ac4 was much more stable with
APIC/LAPIC/ACPI enabled. It would at least run several hours.

Unfortunately, I seem to need it to be able to use APIC (instead of
XT-PIC) interrupts. And my interrupts really are crowded, so finally
being able to enable the APIC would be a great thing. I already tested
it sometimes with interrupts on APIC, SATA definitely *is* faster (but
not for very long time, since it'll crash very soon :) )

I had a VIA KT333, everything was fine. Then I bought the two SATA
drives and the ASUS A7N8X Deluxe v2.0. I changed nothing else. Now it
sucks.

I can confirm that. My processor's very fine, it doesn't lockup with
the VIA board.

I'm also far away from being an expert with that stuff. I would have
no problem to get some specific knowledge on APIC, but even then I
would simply have no clue where the problem might be in the kernel.

Hmm, are you really sure? I mean, we tested *everything*, didn't we?
:-)
The only thing left is the removal of the onboard (PATA) IDE
controller. I can't do that, because my SATA disks have no bootable
system and my workstation is in heavy use for work at the
moment. However, it would be very interesting to see if it still locks
up.
