I missed original problem, but what about this one? Fixes extension
in MSDOS namespace when filename is longer than 12 chars... Someone
familiar with VFAT should look whether VFAT multibyte code cannot be
cleaned up a bit... When I was fixing 'break out of now nested loop'
for pre7, I missed this one. Sorry.
If it works for you, either forward it to Linus, or tell me and I'll
send it - but I do not send patches during weekend ;-) . I do not use 
VFAT to much personally, so more eyes...
