If you compare, make sure that you don't compare the way some people seem
to compare. They see how well the ext2 image compresses, and ignore the
fact that the ext2 image itself has a lot of extraneous stuff (alignment,
bitmaps, very compressible meta-data etc).
The only valid comparison is how big the actual image file is for the same
trees. Also, you should take into account the size of the ext2 module and
cloop. I don't think you'd win.
