I'd like to go further and be able to have families of schedulers that
work together  --- if you're going to vector to a scheduler anyway,
why not do it per process?  That way the special cases for SCHED_FIFO and
SCHED_RR can be moved into separate functions (likewise SCHED_ISO,
SCHED_BATCH, SCHED_GANG etc., as and when they're developed), rather
than being controlled by if() or switch() statements in a common
do-everything scheduler.
In general, it's the interactive SCHED_OTHER scheduler that's been the
problem, and the focus of most of the work.  We more-or-less know how
to do the basic POSIX schedulers.
