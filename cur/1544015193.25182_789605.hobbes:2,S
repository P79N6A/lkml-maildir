Subject: [PATCH 5/5] Fix dubious bitwise 'and' usage spotted by sparse.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/9/463

It doesn't change the semantics, but clearly
the logical 'and' was meant to be used here.
