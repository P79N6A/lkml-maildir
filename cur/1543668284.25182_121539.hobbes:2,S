Hello All!
  Thanks every-one for your replies - it was really helpful.
  I gave our HW guys more job ;-)
  The only question I have left - and what is really more 
  linux-kernel related: is it okay to have ~200-400us IRQs
  disabled? I cannot effectively clear interrupt on device 
   - but I can disable interrupt on our PCI bridge, and later 
  in BH, after clearing irq on device, reenable irq line on
  bridge.

                PCI bridge for custom devices.
2Pavel: got not response - looks like you have enough of your 
        own unemployed ;-)
--- Regards&Wishes! With respect  Ihar "Philips" Filipau, and Phil for
friends
