I would prefer using the __BITS_PER_LONG == 64 check directly, because
it gives you a warning when __BITS_PER_LONG is undefined, whereas the
#ifdef check gets easily fooled by include order problems. Note that
this is not a problem in the kernel for CONFIG_* symbols which are
always defined before the first #include.
