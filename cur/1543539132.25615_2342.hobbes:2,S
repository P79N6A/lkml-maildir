Hi everyone, I am currently trying to get a NFS root file system working on an
embedded device. Everything seems to go fine until I get to init, it trys to run
init and then nothing (no kernel messages or anything else). The ramdisk works
fine when booted from memeory rather than NFS. Has anyone had a similar problem
or does anyone know a fix for this
