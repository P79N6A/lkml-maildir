As written in other similar threads in the past in which you also
participated, I still of the opinion that this is a vm issue and should
be solved as such.
As to the patch in question "fixing" it in the block layer, it's a
fairly simple work around and I'm not totally against it. If you get rid
of the ->bi_throttle stuff and just do sanity checks on the count, then
we could look at getting some testing done.
