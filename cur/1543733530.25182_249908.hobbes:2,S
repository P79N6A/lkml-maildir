No, we want files and directories that can do what streams can do.  This 
means files that are also directories, plugins that aggregate the 
contents of a directory, files that inherit stat data, maybe I forget 
something ---- it is on my website.
Streams themselves are a bad idea because they are a filesystem inside 
of a file which is double the overhead, and they fragment the namespace.

It is always better to lead by example.  These ideas are too new for the 
other fs developers, they need 5 years to get used to them.  Reiser4 
should create something that works, and let others follow when they will.

This is the wrong question.  The right question is, what belongs in a 
unified namespace?  Then having answered that, the extent to which it is 
easier to have all aspects of name resolution together in one body of 
code is an implementation detail that can change and evolve with time.  
A rapidly evolving namespace is easier to modify if it is all one body 
of code.  Furthermore, the people doing the work should really be left 
to decide such implementation details themselves because they are more 
expert on their code than anyone else.
