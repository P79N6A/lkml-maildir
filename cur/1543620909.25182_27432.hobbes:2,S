You are right, AFAIK. You should do down_interruptible if you expect it may
take long to get the semaphore. If you are interrupted, you should return
to userland (with ERESTARTSYS or EINTR error) to have the signal handled.
The trouble is, that when you return ERESTARTSYS, the syscall may, but need not
to be restarted. And unfortunately you can never tell the restarted syscall from
a new invocation.
