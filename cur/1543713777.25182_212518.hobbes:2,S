Hello,
I am working with kenel 2.4.20 on Intel x86.
Now I Had downloaded a kernel source to a different folder and build it.
I added an entry in grub.conf
When I choose to load that kernel everything is OK.
It works wth no problem.
But under /boot I see nothing of the original files (there is only one file 
there , kernel.h).
The output of mount  is :
/dev/hda3 on / type ext3 (rw)
none on /proc type proc (rw)
none on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,gid=5,mode=620)
none on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw)
when I add the following in grub.conf (to the option of choosing to load 
this kernel)
root=/LABEL=/
I get the the following panic message:
VFS: cannot open root device = "LABEL=/" or 00:00
Please append a correct "root= "  boot option.
Kernel panic : VFS: unable to mount root fs on 00:00
Any idea?
Any help will be appreciated.
Sting
