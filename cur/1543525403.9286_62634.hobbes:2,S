Hello:
I looked at the implementation of kiovec (map_user_kiobuf() routine). 
I understood how to get the 'struct page *' for the user buffer. 
What I want to know is, 
   If I want to print the contents of the user buffer (in the kernel)
   using this 'struct page *' how do I do it ('struct page *' points 
   to the physical page right)?
I want to use kiovec for my driver, but I do not want to use the same
interface, but something similar to it. 
Thanks,
Pramodh
I have the relevant code here. Please comment on this.
This is what I have done in the code similar to map_user_kiobuf(). I have
cut n pasted the relevant code only.
my_user_buf_map_routine(unsigned long addr) /* user addr */
{
        int offset;
        unsigned long ptr;
        struct vm_area_struct *vma;
        struct page *map;
        unsigned long buf;
        char *page_buffer;
        
        offset = addr & PAGE_MASK;
        ptr = addr & PAGE_MASK;
        vma = find_vma(current->mm, ptr);       
        handle_mm_fault(current, vma, ptr, (rw==READ));
        map = follow_page(ptr);
        buf = page_address(map);
        page_buffer = (char *) (buf + offset);
        
        /* If i try to print the page_buffer it seg_faults 
	   but I get a valid pointer to the map (struct page *)
	 */
}
