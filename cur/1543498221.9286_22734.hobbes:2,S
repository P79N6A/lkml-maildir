Exporting information from the kernel is relatively simple with the
/proc file system.  However, I would like to reset some of the
counters, either through write() or through truncate().  Where would I
look to see how to accomplish this?  Do I have to worry about mutual
exclusion and if so, what's the preferred way to prevent context
switches in a particular section of code?
