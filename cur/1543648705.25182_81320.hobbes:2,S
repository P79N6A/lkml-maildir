Now there is an idea!  Lock preemption in user space if and
only if the user is executing in a text page shared with the
kernel.  I have seen the need for such locking, but have
always thought they were too dangerous.  This convention
would introduce a much higher level of security.  What is
left is to devise a way to let the kernel know that the
preemption targeted task has left such a page so that the
preemption may proceed.  Possibly the kernel could plant a
hint on the page that each function would check for on exit.
