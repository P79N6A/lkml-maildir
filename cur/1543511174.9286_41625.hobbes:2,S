Why doesn't somebody publish the e-mail address to complain to???
I would have thought Linux has gained enough critical mass that the users
should be able to bring manufacturers to heel.  Combine your voices and
bring about some change.  
And I'm not a hypocrite if someone published a linux website which was like
a petition-style "please complain to this manufacturer" website, I would
definately look it up.  Maybe a linux hardware blacklist site?  I wonder if
I'm just sprouting off and the site I'm talking already exists, I just don't
know it?
Also you KERNEL GURUS are a constant source of amazement to me, you probably
see nothing but complaints in this list.  Well here's a "I think you've done
a bloody marvellous job" comment for you.
Keep it up

Point is (and somebody please forward this to Creative), as long
as they haven't released the source, people should bug them about
problems, not us.
As soon as they release the source, we can take care of the
driver and make sure that it keeps working with all possible
Linux versions. At no cost to Creative Labs.
But until then people really should go after them with
pointy objects if something doesn't work :)  (thanks Larry)
regards,
Rik
