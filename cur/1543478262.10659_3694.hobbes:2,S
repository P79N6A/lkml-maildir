Nice in theory --- but.
The primary rule here is:  if it's on our network, WE run it.  CMU's a top 
target for hackers; we can't afford to have sitting targets outside our 
control on our network.  (SCS doesn't use that rule... and they appear to 
have a *serious* hacker problem, one which occasionally leaks into ECE.  But 
the concerns below apply even more so for them --- after all, we've only LCS 
doing kernel munging, whereas for them it's quite normal.)
Unfortunately, that doesn't quite work with LCS, as they *need* to be able 
to boot experimental kernels and the like.  These folks spend most of their 
time playing with derivatives of the MIT exokernel; they use 2.1/2.2pre on 
non-exokernel machines because it gives them more options for testing and 
experimenting with the TCP/IP stacks on the exokernel machines.
A separate network has been considered.  They've rejected it so far... or 
rather, so far they haven't decided what they want a separate network to 
handle and what if any outside access they want to allow.  And the 
development machines pretty much *have* to have access to both ECE's and 
SCS's AFS servers... and masquerading for AFS clients is a royal pain; it 
looks like I'd have to permanently allocate a block of ports on the 
masquerade server and permanently map them to ports 7000-7003/udp (at least) 
on the clients.  (The AFS servers have long memories as to which ports the 
clients are using.  I wish rx had a TCP option....)
I'm not in a position to work on 2.1/2.2pre support for them, beyond trying 
to make sure things don't break too badly, i.e. fixing the 2.2-unfriendly 
warts in Red Hat 5.2 (/etc/rc.d/init.d/kerneld, util-linux-2.8, etc.) and 
trying to get a stable enough Arla configuration that they can at least try 
to work in the heavily AFS-oriented CMU environment.  And I can't build 
"approved" 2.1/2.2pre kernels for them because they might well be patching 
them (and regularly revising the patches) to support torture of exokernels 
:-)  (And no, I'm don't claim to be smart enough to keep up with these grad 
students.  As if I haven't made that obvious regularly on this list :-)
So a decent way to recover the configuration of a running kernel would be a 
great help around here.
