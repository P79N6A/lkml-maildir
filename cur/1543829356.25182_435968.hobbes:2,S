I'd like to give you one answer , but  I don't have one problem with one
device, I bought (accidentally) one VIA with a Pentium dual-core, which
have a bunch of problems.

Well, this is based in tests along this 4 years, with my two computers.
Like Bjorn said, we don't have any specification of VIA chipsets. But I
like to try, use this quirks only if system don't have IO-APICs enabled.
Many VIA systems work like that, for example my old laptop.
For me, I know that my old laptop needs the quirks and run with
interrupts in XT-PIC, and with my new desktop, I quit sure that don't
need the quirks and system runs with interrupts in IO-APIC-edge and
IO-APIC-level. 
Based in, what I read in this original thread
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/18/92
 , seems to me, that we could try this
solution, if we have a easy way to know what kind of interrupts have the
device. 
Thanks Randy for your time,
