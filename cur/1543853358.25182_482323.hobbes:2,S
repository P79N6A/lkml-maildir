Whilst I've got all the smart people looking at this ...
/*max window size: 1024(direct blocks) + 3([t,d]indirect blocks) */
#define EXT2_MAX_RESERVE_BLOCKS         1027
Is that wrong? If it's meaning one triple, one double, and one single
indirect block, surely it can span a boundary, so we need (potentially)
two of each?
