There is no write allocate.
There are 2 optimizations for bulk memory copy:
- avoid the write allocate. Possible with the mmx or sse non-temporal 
cache hints
    * already in the kernel. Difference between MMX and faster_copy
- avoid dram page misses, and stream from the memory chips with maximum 
efficiency.
    * new optimization. "prefetch" is a hint for the cpu that the 
program might need the memory
        If I understand the AMD document correctly, then this is not 
what's needed for bulk
        memory copy: we know that we'll need that cacheline. Thus a real 
read, to force the cpu to
        fetch the cacheline, even if all read buffers are occupied.
