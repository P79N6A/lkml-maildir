Subject: [PATCH -mm 0/5] Freezer update
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
The patches in these series update the freezer to eliminate some existing
shortcomings, so please consider them as 2.6.23 material.
The patches do the following:
* update the freezer documentation to describe, previously omitted, important
  reason for freezing tasks (ie. memory shrinking)
* remove sys_sync() from the freezer and make the suspend/hibernation code
  invoke it explicitly
* prevent new tasks from inheriting TIF_FREEZE set from the parents
* introduce freezer-firendly wrappers around wait_event_interruptible()
  and wait_event_interruptible_timeout()
* prevent the freezer from sending signals to kernel threads
Greetings,
Rafael
