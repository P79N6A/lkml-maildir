This patch-set aims at removing the current limit on argv+env space aka.
MAX_ARG_PAGES.
The new mm is created before the binfmt code runs, the stack is placed at the
highest address supported by that architecture.
The argv+env data is then copied from the old mm into the new mm (which is
inactive at that time - this introduces some cache coherency issues).
Then we run the binfmt code, which will compute the final stack address. The
existing stack will be moved downwards (or upwards on PA-RISC) to the desired
place.
This 'trick' heavily relies on the MMU, so for no-MMU archs we stay with the
old approach.

Plenty of changes all around, changes listed in the individual patches. We hope
to have addressed all issues raised.
