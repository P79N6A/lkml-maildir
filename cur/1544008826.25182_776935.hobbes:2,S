Do you mean exit_mm()->...->exit_mmap() ? But this doesn't matter, this
->mm is going away. Nobody can read these counters when ->mm_users == 0,
no?

But the difference can be huge. Let's suppose the process has 2 threads
T1 and T2.
T1 exits, calls update_hiwater_vm(), notices that mm->hiwater_vm must be
updated, and preempted right before mm->hiwater_vm = new_value.
T2 does free(malloc(A_LOT)) and exits. It sets the correct value for
->hiwater_vm which takes A_LOT into account and disappears.
T1 resumes, and "reverts" ->hiwater_vm to the "new_value" which was
calculated before.
Now, since T1 is the last exiting thread, the whole thread group
exits and we report the wrong ->hiwater_vm to the userspace.
Yes, this race is unlikely. But there is another reason (perhaps
not very good) why I tried to remove update_hiwater_xxx() from
do_exit().
Imho this code looks as if: from now it is "safe" to use ->hiwater_xxx
directly because we already updated it. But it is not. Unless we are
the last thread, we can't trust mm->hiwater_xxx anyway, we should
re-check get_mm_rss/total_vm.

Yes, I was going to convert task_mem(), but noticed that it has
to read get_mm_rss() and ->total_vm anyway. Still, perhaps it
would be more clean to use the new macros anyway, even if this
wiil (unlikely) need a couple of extra cpu ticks.

I think that update_hiwater_xxx() should be "private" for vm code which
does zap/unmap, and any observer should use get_mm_hiwater_xxx(). Nobody
should use mm->hiwater_xxx directly.
But I don't (and of course can't) have a strong opinion on that,
will wait for your verdict and re-send.
The patch need the update anyway, I just noticed that if we remove
update_hiwater_xxx() from do_exit(), we should change the comment
in exit_mmap().

Yes sorry ;) The only problem with mutt is that it is not possible
to change CC while editing the text (unless edit_headers is set).
