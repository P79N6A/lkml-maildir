Yes.  I was thinking in a rather DEC VT100/Putty/xterm- centric way
for a moment; please excuse the slip.
It's irritating that logging in from the wrong kind of terminal
doesn't just provide the right "user experience" for the command line
automatically.  It's also a pain that ssh doesn't inform the remote
end whether the local terminal is UTF-8, so everything seem to be
working fine until one day you discover typing "£" in an editor just
beeps.  Grr..  Oh well.
These are all solvable in userspace.  Then again, so were most of the
other stty options; didn't stop them from being implemented in the kernel :)
