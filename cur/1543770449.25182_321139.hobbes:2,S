yeah, and i wasnt arguing for the most finegrained locking: cacheline 
bouncing hurts worst-case latencies just as much (in fact, more, being a 
worst-case) than it hurts scalability.

(the best is obviously to have no locking at all, unless there's true

PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY does it without preemption. PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY is quite 
similar to most of the lowlatency patchkits, just simpler.

there's a slow trend related to RCU: rcu_read_lock() is silent about 
what kind of implicit lock dependencies there are. So when we convert a 
spinlock-using piece of code to RCU we lose that information, making it 
harder to convert it to another type of locking later on. (But this is 
not a complaint against RCU, just a demonstration that we do lose 
information.)
