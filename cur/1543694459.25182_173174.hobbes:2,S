I've been thinking about adding WRITESYNC to do exactly that, and keep
WRITEBARRIER with its current functionality for journalled file
systems. WRITESYNC would be exactly what you describe, it just wont
imply any io scheduler ordering. So a post-flush would be enough to
handle that case.
The problem is that as far as I can see the best way to make fsync
really work is to make the last write a barrier write. That
automagically gets everything right for you - when the last block goes
to disk, you know the previous ones have already. And when the last
block completes, you know the whole lot is on platter. If you were just
using WRITESYNC, you would have to WRITESYNC all blocks in that range
instead of just WRITE WRITE WRITE ... WRITEBARRIER. So the barrier would
still end up being cheaper, unless the fsync just flushes a single page
in which case the WRITESYNC is enough.
