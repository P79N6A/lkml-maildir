Hi all,
	I'm studing how and 'trying to write' a scsi driver.
	To test driver's performance now
	I'm working with sg_utils < of Gilbert >.
	When I use sg_dd512 all work fine!
	But (there's always a but) 
	when I use sg_dd2048 (on the same device with the same driver)
	I see that it writes and correctly reads only the first 2048 byte 
	after that, it doesn't behave as I think:
	it writes and reads rubbish!
Questions:
	Is it correct using sg_dd2048 on devices with sector size = 512?
 	I have seen that the difference between sg_dd512 and sg_dd2048 is
 	in the scsi cmnd (in the 'transfert lenght' field), 
	where sg_ddXXXX writes the number of blocks.  
 	Who have to handle this value? 
Thanks,
	Sandro
