Actually, at least for me, the _old_ radeon driver works without any 
modifications at all in text mode. Rock stable image, unlike the new one 
that needed the clock fixes.
But trying to start X hangs the system hard, which may well be an issue 
with the old radeonfb. Whenever you have a new driver, I will test.

Actually, there's another issue, which is that the default G5 config 
enables drivers/serial/pmac_zilog.c, which has a
	#include <asm/kgdb.h>
in it that will cause the build to fail.
Anyway, with that fixed, it will compile and appears to work on the G5. 
Thanks. Although I did see it hang when I inserted a USB keyboard (in 
addition to the X problem). Hmm.
