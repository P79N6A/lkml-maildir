Depends on what you mean by real-life situations.  If you actually 
need to handle over ten thousand outgoing connections, this change
could indeed help relieve port exhaustion.  Think of web spiders
or web caches on gigabit/sec links.  
Perhaps one could go further, and have the kernel pick an ip address as 
well; that would make the app even easier to code.  That means
changing connect() rather than bind().  It looks like the ip address for 
ephemeral connect() is picked by tcp_v4_connect / ip_route_connect / 
ip_route_output / ip_route_output_key / ip_route_output_slow / inet_select_addr().  
inet_select_addr() calls for_primary_ifa to iterate through the devices, 
so it doesn't pick up aliases.  Making this pick an alias at random
is kind of a gross thought.  I suppose there could be a socket option
SO_PREFER_ALIASES, and make it pick an alias 'at random'.  That's a change
I'd rather not make, since it looks like socket option space is about used up.

SO_REUSE might let my app's connections collide with those
of other apps, wouldn't it?  Doesn't seem very clean.  A web cache
or web spider probably wouldn't use SO_REUSE, would it?
I guess I'm resigned to managing the ephemeral port number in my app.
A bit of a pain, but that's life.  If this ever starts bugging
lots of people, I'm sure a consensus about how to make life easier
will pop up.
