(Please CC me in replie,s if it's not too much trouble.)
I had this issue with previous kernels, but I don't know when the
problem
started. I once was able to read this card.
Not sure what filesystems are on either card, not sure if it matters.
The cards are not mounted automatically so I am guessing that the
file system doesn't become an issue until mount time.
The device is a Phison 6-in-1 and has no problems with
other cards.
When inserted this card causes no problems:
This is a 128MB card:

When the next card is inserted the keyboard partially locks up, the
special laptop keys work still.
e.g. the fn-contrast up/dn works still but not other keys work
Removing the card returns things to as before insertion.
This is a 64MB card from a phone:
