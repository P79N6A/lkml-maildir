They don't mind. Those people install Checkpoint on Linux. A product of
which previous releases were even incompatible with security updates !

You don't get it. One of my collegue installed quagga on his binary-only
laptop. Now that he found it very useful and showed how to can be used,
he's planning on setting up servers to run it to bring new services. So
his *crappy* laptop full of binary-only drivers and relying on ndiswrapper
allows him to build a proof of concept and get the possibility to run it
on real hardware.

Except that someone has to maintain the patch, because with the speed the
kernel is changing, a patch against 2.6.14 will not work on 2.6.15. I've
tried UML on 2.4 in the past, and I've learned the hard way not to rely
on patches for old features when developpers consider them obsolete (2.4
support ended when 2.6 began).

Keeping it marked as BROKEN is fine. It may even taint the kernel, that's
not a problem. Removing it is wrong.
