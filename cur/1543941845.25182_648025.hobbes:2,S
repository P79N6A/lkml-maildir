Imho having a file system interface means having all its problems.
Imagine you have some information about tasks exported with a file system interface.
Obviously to collect the information you have to hold some spinlock like tasklist_lock or similar.
Obviously, you have to drop the lock between sys_read() syscalls.
So interface gets much more complicated - you have to rescan the objects and somehow find the place where
you stopped previous read. Or you have to to force reader to read everything at once.

That's what I would start with.

Not exactly. For checkpointing/restoring we actually need only one new API call for each
subsystem - create some object with given ID (and maybe parameters, if they are not dynamically changeable by user).
While Pierre's patchset adds different API call - change object ID.
