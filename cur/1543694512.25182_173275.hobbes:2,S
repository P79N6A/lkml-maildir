None of the TCQ/FUA components of the spec mention ordering.  According to
the "letter" of the specification, if you issue two queued writes for the
same LBA, the drive has the choice of which one to do first and which one to
put on the media first, which is totally broken in common sense land.
Luckilly, us drive guys are a bit smarter (if only a bit)...
If you issue a FUA write for data already in cache, and you put the FUA
write onto the media, there's no problem if you discard the cached data that
you were going to write.
In drives with a unified cache, they'll always be consistent provided the
overlapping interface transfers happen in the same order they were
issued.... this is common sense.
However, you're right in that non-overlapping cached write data may stay in
cache a long time, which potentially gives you a very large time hole in
which your FUA'd data is on the media and your user data is still hangin' in
the breeze prior to a flush on a very busy drive.
