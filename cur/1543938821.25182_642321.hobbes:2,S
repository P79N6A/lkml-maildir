Because I'm using it as a boolean?

Okay, it looks like there might be a race condition between 
enable_slot() and disable_slot() if some other task calls disable_slot() 
while enable_slot() is between the test_bit() and flush_workqueue() 
calls.  I can fix that by avoiding the call to flush_workqueue() in 
enable_slot() and allocating and queueing a work queue item to defer the 
call to pci_rescan().  And enable_slot() won't then need to check if the 
slot was marked as removed - it can just go ahead and allocate and queue 
a work item.
