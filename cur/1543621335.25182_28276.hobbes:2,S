Actually - yes.
First, I can not prevent some system admin from making the core pattern
a bad pattern.  For example, a pattern of /usr/bin/%N would be a bad thing (tm)
However, as long as the system admin (who is the person who can set the pattern)
does not do that, the code prevents a rouge name (hostname or command name)
from causing problems.
(I prevent the use of "/" in either the hostname or command name, for example)
I have tried most everything I could think of.  And, since the host name is
usually not setable by non-root, it makes it even less likely.
In fact, with a pattern like /corefiles/%H-%N-%P.core, there is even less
likelyhood that a coredump can cause problems since I can make the /corefiles
partition its own location and thus coredumps will not write to the key
filesystem.
BTW - both FreeBSD and OpenBSD have a simular format (I took my insperation
from FreeBSD, which I always liked better since the default there is %N.core)

The key is to filter certain characters.  Mostly the '/' in any of the
variables.
However, there is always the problem of someone with root access making
a bad setting in the sysctl.  But then, if they have root, they don't
need to set some sysctl in order to cause damage.
