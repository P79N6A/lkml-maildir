Hi,
This question may seem naive, but can anyone tell me if there is any
structured way of writing patches? 
I mean suppose I want to implement some
kernel mechanism, and I define my data structures etc. and made most of
the code as loadable  module to start with, but still I am having to
change some parts of the kernel code at the development time, and I
want to make that change using patches, so that I do not have to browse
thru the files to change the code as I debug. 
Is there any structured way of doing this?
Happy New Year
Sourav
