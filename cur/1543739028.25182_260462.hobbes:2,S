note that meanwhile i have implemented another variant:
  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=109771365907797&w=2
i dont think this will be the final interface (the _rt postfix is
stupid, it should probably be _spin?), but i think this is roughly the
structure of how to attack it - a minimal extension to the RCU APIs to
allow for serialization. What do you think about this particular
approach?

in the serialization solution in -U0 it would be possible to immediately
free the RCU entries and hence have no DoS/OOM situation - although the
-U0 patch does not do this yet.
