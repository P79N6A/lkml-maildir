"A bad analogy is like a leaky screw driver."
Your screwdriver is leaking!
If you get a letter from your aunt in Rome, and it is post-marked
'Moscow', you might doubt the authenticity.  If it claims to be from
your swiss bank with the same post mark you would doubt it even more.
I'm not saying that postmarks are a particularly good analogy,
but if I got had a knock on my door (SYN) and opened it (ACK /
SYN-ACK), and the person said
 Hi, I'm from the Thunk group (HELO thunk.org) and I have a letter
 from Ted at MIT (MAIL FROM: <tytso@mit.edu>) 
then I'm not sure I would believe them (well, I might, but my butler
shouldn't).

"half-baked" - maybe that is appropriate.
I've been thinking lately that SPF is one of those "125mls of water in
a 250ml glass" things.
To some it is half full, to others it is half empty.
It's probably like monolithic kernels - there is no future in it!
