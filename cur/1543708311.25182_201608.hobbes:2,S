As a rule: KERNEL IS WRONG PLACE.
There are some primitive things that to an extent make sense, but
WHOLE OpenGL (which alone is nothing) or any other graphics server 
entirely in kernel ?   No way.
The XFree86 server can use kernel supplied DRI (Direct Rendering 
Interface) facilities, if such are available.
You can find more about this recurring topic in list archives.
