I just found this:
            Device (SVG)
                Device (LCD)
It looks too simple to fit video.c.
But it is quite easy to implement in hotkey.c.
Because it has dedicated device with HID and , 
well-known method name.
Ideally, you can enable this jus like this:

Note, the latest hotkey.c need patch at

Thanks,
