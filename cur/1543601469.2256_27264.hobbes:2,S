I think the multipath driver would benefit from something like the
different modes in the new network bonding driver:
* round robin
* active backup policy
* XOR
(Not sure if XOR would be needed for md?)
I think some other ideas can be stolen from the bonding driver as well,
as the problem is very simular - e.g. the concept of low level drivers
(optionally) delivering status information, so md don't have to try and
fail to detect a link is down, and the timeout settings.
