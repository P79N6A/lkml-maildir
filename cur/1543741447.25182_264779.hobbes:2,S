Sure you can, if you use the "bksend" script Andrew can import your
changes into a bk tree, change them, and then send the combined changes to
Linus.
The problem is that unless both Andrew's and Linus' tree are at exactly
the same version yours is, there will be some merge changesets in between
which really muddle up the change history.
That's fixable, but "bk clone" plus "bk undo" are too expensive at the
moment -- if that took a few seconds instead of a few minutes, people
would probably do it more readily.
