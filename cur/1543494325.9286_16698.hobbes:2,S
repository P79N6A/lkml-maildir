This sounds much the same as what I'm experiencing with my Amiga here
(kenel 2.0.36 [as from the Debian 2.1 rescue floppy] on an A1200 w/
Apollo 1240 Turboboard, 10gig HD on the internal controller, 2MB chip
mem, 32MB fast local mem, everything else plain vanilla).
When I tar -xzf a file bigger than about 2MB, the system locks up, I can
switch consoles, but I cannot type, Ctrl-Alt-Del doesn't work,
Ctrl-Amiga-Amiga does the usual thing ("C-A-A reset warning. System will
reboot in 10 seconds"). I cannot say whether gzunzipping and untarring in
separate steps will work. I will try that when I come home (been in the
university all night).

A short grep over the sources shows that tar doesn't know about
SCHED_FIFO. I'm not sure if this is the same problem or caused by the same
thing (Although the kernel is rewritten from scratch, the developers'
ideas aren't). If anyone has a 2.2 tree that compiles for m68k, I could
do some additional testing. If someone is interested, I put a .config
matching my setup on
