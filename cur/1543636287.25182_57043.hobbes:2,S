POSIX says the state of the file descriptor when close fails (with errno
!= EBADF) is unspecified, which means:
    The value or behavior may vary among implementations that conform to
    IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. An application should not rely on the existence
    or validity of the value or behavior. An application that relies on
    any particular value or behavior cannot be assured to be portable
    across conforming implementations.
