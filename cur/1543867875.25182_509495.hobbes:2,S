Yes I noticed, and you replied just before I send off an email explicitly
asking you about this :)  At first glance I thought it was that other piece of
irq compression that showed up in arch/x86_64/io_apic.c but it appears
arch/i386/io_apic.c does not have that.
Anyway now all we have to do is bump up NR_IRQS and we should be good, patch
in a moment.
