Well, if you want to get really technical about it, we are already in the new
millenium as Christ was born in 4 BC, NOT 1 AD.  So its rather moot as to
whether the new millenium starts in 2000 or 2001.  Since the 1900's cease to
be as of Jan 1st, most people treat it as a new century/millenium.  Most
people could care less about 2001 technicalities.  And neither should you!
