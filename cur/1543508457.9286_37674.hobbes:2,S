That's in the new ADB code that isn't merged into the main tree yet.
There's CONFIG_ADB, CONFIG_ADB_KEYBOARD, CONFIG_ADB_MOUSE and a bunch of
CONFIG_ADB_xxx for various low-level drivers. The new code has been sent
to Paul Mackerras over in the PPC camp and he's doing some PPC tweaking
before it gets put into the main tree. We're thinking it's going to end up
in drivers/adb now that it's multi-architecture (when I get my NeXT box
soon I'll probably hack on that Linux port to use the new code too.)
