It's hard-earned experience.  We constantly have to teach hardware 
vendors how to write good drivers.
At some point you have to step away from the spec, and ask yourself what 
makes sense for Linux.  I've already had to poke T10 when they put silly 
things in the SAT spec.
As a tangent, I already have a design for a Linux filesystem that makes 
use of SCSI object-based storage (to James's horror, no doubt :)).  It's 
a fun thing to ponder.

Certainly.  The historical disconnect is where hardware vendors tend to 
presume They Know Best, when in reality it needs to be an equal 
tradeoff.  Hardware vendors must admit they don't know Linux, and Linux 
developers must admit that hardware vendors know their own hardware 
better than anyone else.
