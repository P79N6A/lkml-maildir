The run_task_queue() removal was a minor issue according to me.
My point is that if we are going to sleep and wakeup bdflush we don't need
to run_task_queue() _before_ running bdflush(). When bdflush will start
some request, it will then call run_task_queue at the end.
So the removal wasn't intented to get performances but to remove a thing
that made no sense to me and that should change nothing.

;)
To make sure that you have many swap cache entries allocated in the
hash-buckets you must press SYSRQ+M and check the number of swap cache
pages. If the number is high and the distribution is good it even without
+offset it means that it didn't relevant differences.

Well I think I'll remove it. Mark was right that since we are always
single threaded we can't generate a ping-pong between cachelines on
different CPUs (as instead happens in the irq-struct case). But I wanted
to get numbers before removing it ;)). Thanks.
