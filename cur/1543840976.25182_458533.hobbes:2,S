Eh ... we'd end up with another complaint from the hotplug
folks, in another year, when some obscure constraint on
nested cpusets thwarted their efforts to unplug something.
It's best if cpusets just deals with it somehow, and doesn't
complain about the comings and goings of hardware.
At least, that's my take on it ...
