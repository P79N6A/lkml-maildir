As DVD writting is broken in 2.5, I am usualy under 2.4, and before
2.4.21-rc1-ac3 I was using ide-scsi (ide-scsi wasn't working with
2.4.21-rc1-ac3), but yes, no problem sofar ;-)
Does IOW mean In Other Word?
I have put my config in 
http://ulima.unil.ch/greg/linux/
 or directly:
http://ulima.unil.ch/greg/linux/2.4.21-rc1-ac3-config
http://ulima.unil.ch/greg/linux/2.5.69-config
Thank you very much,
