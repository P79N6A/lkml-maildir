Not a big one.  A common pattern is to have some defines like
#define FOO_BASE 0x12340000
#define FOO_THIS (FOO_BASE + 0)
#define FOO_THAT (FOO_BASE + 4)
etc.
Your code looks similar to this pattern, so I asked.  If it doesn't
make sense, fair.

Hmm.  It does what you say.  Whether this is robust and will continue
to do so... I'm not sure.

Can you either introduce a proper ndelay or get rmk to officially
bless your use of (constant, I know) floats in the kernel source?  A
proper ndelay would obviously be preferred.

We have suboptimal code in the kernel, true.  I still prefer new code
to have slightly higher standards, so the overall quality improves
slowly.  Therefore, pointing to the other ugly duckling is not an
excuse for being mud-covered. ;)
But you are right.  The other ducklings could use a bath as well.
