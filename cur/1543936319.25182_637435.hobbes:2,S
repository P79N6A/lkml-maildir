Can't rightly say. I didn't try it before because 2.6.23 fails to
compile under debian sarge. 2.6.24-rc7 did compile but it has failed to
come back up. Don't know why as the box is remote (though it wasn't in
use again yet due to the afore mentioned problems so this is merely an
annoyance). I'll find out more on Monday.
