Using ide_task_t->{command_type, handler}, command_type values:
	IDE_DRIVE_TASK_IN - read
	IDE_DRIVE_TASK_RAW_WRITE - write
	IDE_DRIVE_TASK_NO_DATA - no data
If handler is NULL we know that command is a DMA one.
HDIO_DRIVE_TASKFILE gets information about taskfile from user-space in
ide_task_request_t->{command_type, data_phase}, data_phase can be:
	TASKFILE_OUT_DMA{Q}
	TASKFILE_IN_DMA{Q}
	TASKFILE_MULTI_OUT
	TASKFILE_OUT
	TASKFILE_MULTI_IN
	TASKFILE_IN
	TASKFILE_NO_DATA
and this information is translated into ide_task_t->handler.
This is of course non-optimal and driver should be using something like
ata_taskfile->protocol (as in libata).
Please note that any attempts to verify commands (like this 'switch')
will fail for future or vendor specific ones.
