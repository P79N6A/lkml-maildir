Thanks for your notification. I didn't notice that syntax rule.

Andrew Morton told that drivers which need readq/writeq should use ones of kernel,
and if architecture part of kernel does not provide readq/writeq, drivers should be disabled.
This is Andrew's mail:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=122625885124798&w=2
===> Quote:
#ifdef readq
Is a suitable way of determining whether the architecture implements
readq and writeq.  It isn't pretty, but it will suffice.
A problem with it is that drivers will then do
#ifndef readq
<provide a local implementation here>
#endif
which rather sucks - we don't want lots of little private readq/writeq
implementations all over the tree.
Perhaps it would be better to have a CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_READQ and to then
disable these drivers on the architectures which don't provide
readq/writeq support.
<====
This is new patch.
description of this patch
Adding implementation of readq/writeq to x86_32,
and adding config value to x86 architecture to determine existence of readq/writeq
