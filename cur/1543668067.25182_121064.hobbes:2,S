Celsius can go negative, which may be yucky
and hard to test. Kelvin generally doesn't
suffer this problem. (yeah, yeah, quantum stuff...)
Getting temperature display into "top" would sure
be nice, but not if that means requiring a library
that almost nobody has installed. It's good to give
apps a simple way to get CPU temperature, including
per-CPU data for SMP systems when available.
Info about sensor quality would be good. For example,
my CPU measures temperature in 4-degree increments
and is not calibrated.
