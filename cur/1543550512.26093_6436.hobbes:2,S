This bug, which I posted about earlier tonight, appears to be resolved by
Rik van Riel's latest vm patch (www.surriel.com/patches/2.4.0-t9p7-vmpatch)
although I can't be certain.  But prior to the patch I could trigger the
BUG quite easily with a kernel compile or such and I have been compiling
kernels since it came out with no more BUGs.  Thanks, Rik...
