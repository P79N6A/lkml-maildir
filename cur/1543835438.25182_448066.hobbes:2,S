Hmm, actually, people with problems like Keith's are the target
audience, or at least were meant to be.  See the mmap example
I posted in the original thread.

The /dev/itimer wasn't meant for high resolution, only accurate and
reliable within the limits of the jiffy counter and easy to use. That
doesn't mean that it can't be improved to provide high resolution; only,
that this wasn't the design goal.  But I think, that the API is good
enough to provide high resolution at any time without changing user
space code.
(IMHO most people consider a resolution of 1 ms to be "high enough".)

Hm... I'm not sure what you mean.  Sure, a blocking read may be a nice hint
to the scheduler because we know exactly how long we're gonna sleep.  But
I think that a blocking read is used very seldom.  Normally, the apps would
block via select/poll.  And then the hints become looser - you only know
the latest time when the process definitely wants to run again.
Another scheduling hint could be the set interval.  One could assume that
an app that sets an interval of 1/50th second does want to run regularly
every 1/50th second.  But that may be hard to use for scheduling decisions,
especially when an app starts to use more than one timer.
Ciao, ET.
