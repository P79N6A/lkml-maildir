Thanks for that. A new utlitity to learn. :) Anyways, after getting my
laptop (and hence my access to email) back after a week I did a fair bit
of testing and the only way I can duplicate the above is by copying from
one hd to another. Further testing has led me to believe that the ext3
error is more of a symptom of data corruption caused in the IDE layer
somewhere rather then anything else.
I've posted a bug wrt to what I've discovered in the ide update thread
(my message before this one).
