Hi all,
This isn't exactly a kernel bug, but it's probably a Configure-script issue.
After patching 2.2.0pre4 up to 2.2.0pre6, and re-running 'make bzImage', I
noticed that both the 'asm' and 'linux' symlinks under /usr/include/ were
missing.
Neither 'make menuconfig' nor 'make config' fixed this for me, which IIRC
worked with Linux 2.0.x.  So I fixed it by hand. :-)
