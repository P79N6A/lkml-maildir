A side note:  SCSI is not a bus.  It is an architecture and a set of
implementation standards; including command set standards, transport
protocol standards and interconnect standards for a whole lot of
different applications, transports, and interconnects, and not all of
the latter are actual buses.  The oldest of SCSI interconnects, SCSI
Parallel Interconnect alias SPI, is often mistaken for all of SCSI even
though its role is diminishing.  There is much more:

You are right though that Linux' SCSI command set drivers and SCSI core
are used for non-SCSI transports too, and this is not very well
reflected by the configuration menu layout.  (But is there an ideal menu
layout?  I'm sure there isn't.)
