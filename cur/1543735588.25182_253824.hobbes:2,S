Hi All,
I have written a "frame-buffer" module (for an LCD).
Can somebody tell me how I can enable it and make it work?
I am sure that any graphical application will make it work, but I don't have 
one at the
moment, so are there any user-mode basic linux commands that can make it 
work?
Thanks
Shai
