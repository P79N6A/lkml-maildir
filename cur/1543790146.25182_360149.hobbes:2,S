statfs() is called infrequently.  If it's expensive, it's expensive.
OTOH lookup is done for every operation.  The filesystem would have to
check for a remote mountpoint before doing _any_ operation, just so
that the occasional statfs() would return valid results.
Oh, and what if remote mountpoints go away, and the (unprivileged
userspace) server is not notified.  How will the local mount structure
always correctly reflect the remote one?
It's far simpler just to let statfs() return different results based
on path within the filesystem.  What's your problem with it?
