So these defaults would be hard-coded values that take into account,
among other factors:
 - the actual audio hardware (e.g. variations in the analog part)
 - possibly the position of a "volume" knob somewhere
 - the environment of the machine (ambient noise, acceptable
   volume level)
And all that for what ? If you want to turn up the volume after
booting, all you need is one whole line in your rc scripts. So
far I haven't seen a single argument as to why this wouldn't be
sufficient.
