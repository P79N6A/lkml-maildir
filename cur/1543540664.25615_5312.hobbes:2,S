it does (probably due to a bug and not intentionally as his code looked
awful anyway). It keeps failing for a long time and then eventually hits a
very large old_mmap() request which succeeds and that lets him allocate 1G
(on my machine) unless you set RLIMIT_AS appropriately. Try it - although
now things are all clear so it is no longer interesting...
