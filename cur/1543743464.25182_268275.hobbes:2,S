X should be scheduled on the other CPU just fine. Only per-CPU kernel
threads (which are affine to their particular CPU) are affected by this
problem - ordinary tasks not. I.e. the system threads that have /0 and
/1 in their name. In theory you should not even need to chrt the hardirq
threads, those should schedule fine too.
