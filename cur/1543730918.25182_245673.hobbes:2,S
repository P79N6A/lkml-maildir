Indeed, it's a real shame.
Everybody should never forget, as history tells, that extremist positions
quickly lead to destruction.
I hope that open source movement will never become fundamentalism.
Nemosoft, I can't but say thank you for your great driver.
When I bought a new webcam, I chose a philips one just because there was
your driver, and I can esaily guess other people did the same.
So indeed philips too got a reward for trusting Nemosoft.
I don't know if philips will ever release the entire source, there are
simply other implications for this; industrial secrets that, if source was
released, could be used from some other rival company.
Nemosoft, just a couple of advices from a wise guy :) (just joking, ok?)
You should really consider about writing pwc/pwcx as add-on module, I
don't think that would be a degradation. After all, there are some
wonderful drivers that are written this way (eagle-usb, linux-wlan-ng,
etc.etc.).
You could also keep the un-hooked version in the kernel and write patches
that could be applied to the kernel to get the full-featured version.
I know that both choices would bring you some more work;
but you could rightfully request a small one-time fee/contribution for the
extra work. I, for once, would be willing to pay for it.
