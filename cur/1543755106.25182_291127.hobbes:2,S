There are two choices for the security model in FUSE.  The first
choice is that the userspace filesystem does the permission checking
in each operation.  Current uid and gid is available, group list is
presently not.
The other choice is that the kernel does the normal file mode based
permission checking.  Obviously in this case the filesystem can still
implement an additional (stricter) permission policy.
The "root banning" issue is in fact orthogonal to this.  The default
operation is that only the user who mounted the filesystem is allowed
to access the contents.  This behavior can be switched off with a
mount option, to allow access to all users.

Looking at the changelog it was added on 2004-03-30, so you must be
using a pretty outdated version.

Heh?  Where did you see error value 512 (ERESTARTSYS)?  It's not
something that the userspace daemon can return.

That's pretty subjective.  Please back up your statement with concrete
examples, so maybe then I can do something about it.

Well, how much "hell of a lot" actually is depends on a lot of things.
E.g. on whether the backed up filesystem is modified externally (not
just through the kernel).  If not, then it will stay consistent
without any extra messaging.  This can be set by a timeout parameter
for each looked up entry.
The extra flexibility offered by an inode based kernel interface
(FUSE) instead of a path based one (LUFS) I think outweighs the
disadvantage of having to once look up each path element.

Yes, useful for some filesystems (sshfs, ftpfs) useless for others.  I
plan to add a generic caching layer to the FUSE library as well.

In the LUFS package yes.  However I bet, currently there are much more
applications which use FUSE than LUFS.
