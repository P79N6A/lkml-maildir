Hear ! Hear ! Maybe I could also get you interested in the idea
of moving headers with inline functions to the only spot where
they are actually used ?
E.g. most of include/net/tcp.h pretty much only matters for
net/ipv4/. It would be so nice if a  grep -w thing *.[ch]  in
net/ipv4/ would really find all uses of "thing".
