Make that:
http://www.xmission.com/~ebiederm/files/kexec/kexec-tools-1.6.tar.gz
And the latest patches can be found at:
http://www.xmission.com/~ebiederm/files/kexec/
The basic breakout is 
linux-2.4.47.x86kexec.diff is the core patch.
linux-2.4.47.x86kexec-hwfixes.diff 
       applies on top and is has some hardware fixes that
       shutdown kernel code, and make things work better.
       Mostly this is the code to get SMP to shutdown properly.
And it looks like .48 is out so I need to do another patch update.
Eric
