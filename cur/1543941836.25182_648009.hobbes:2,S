   Yeah, you've fixed it now, MD's are running OK.
   Now I can say that both 2.6.24-mm1 and 2.6.24-git11 do NOT "see" any
of mine LVM-2 disks. pvscan, for e.g., finds nothing at all.
   Mine system's configuration is LVM-2 on MD (Software RAID); 2.6.24
handles it just fine.
   P. S. I'm not subscribed to linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org (yet), so
please keep my e-mail address intact :-) when replying.
