   What size of actually used hash table --unix_socket_table--?
   If it is 256, probably forall_unix_sockets is dangerous.
   forall_unix_sockets use 257 table size.
   And If I apply this fix, test program can work.
Slot 256 is a special slot fo unbound sockets.  The table is
sized to UNIX_HASH_SIZE + 1, so it is ok and your patch is
not right.
Please see the other email from Alexey Kuznetsov which includes
a real fix for your bug.
