REISER4 FOR INCLUSION IN THE LINUX KERNEL.
Dave Lynch takes a reasoned approach to REISER4.

Jeff Garzik is "saying" that he wants REISER4 to stay out of the main
kernel, for reasons he is not willing to tell you.

On the basis of what I have seen here,... Hans Reiser was probably an
angel.

Of course, this is an entirely reasonable request of Reiser's.
One meet with an array of unreasonable actions, but mainly STALLING 
which has led to REISER4 never becoming part of the main kernel.
It has also lead to many false claims about REISER4. Claims that are
never backed up with solid statistics, but used to keep REISER4 out of
the kernel and tar its reputation.

I AM SURE THERE ARE A HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD GIVE IT A TRY.

It was not his pissing and moaning, etc,... these were just excuses to
keep REISER4 from succeeding. The truth is, that any excuse would do.
The real reasons are financial and backed by big money (sometimes, big
egos).

Yes, the argument that anything that needs testing can't get in is
indeed stupid.
But stupid things often work. Is REISER4 in the kernel? Is REISER4 a
success?

No. Only those things that threaten big money.

Why not defend Hans? He is in jail on what appear to be trumped-up
charges, just like the trumped-up complainants about his filesystem.

Money talks, BS walks. Reiser4 is a little guy. You should play in my
league.

Yeap.

Yeap. REISER4 merits inclusion.
