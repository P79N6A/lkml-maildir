Got question to ask.  I have RedHat Linx 6.0 (Linux 2.2.5) with Scott's
"kdb" loaded in.  When I use "insmod" load my Fibre Channel HBA driver, it
shows:
scsi :  1 host.
Vendor: SEAGATE   ModelL ST39102FC      Rev: 0006
Type:   Direct-Access
Detected scsi disk sda at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
SCSI device sda: hdwr sector= 512 bytes.  Sectors= 17783240 [8683 MB] [8.7
GB]
sda: unknown partition table
SCSI device sda: hdwr sector= 512 bytes.  Sectors= 17783240 [8683 MB] [8.7
GB]
sdb: unknown partition table
SCSI device sda: hdwr sector= 512 bytes.  Sectors= 17783240 [8683 MB] [8.7
GB]
sdc: unknown partition table
Then it gives message:
kdb: Exceeded symbol table size.  Increase KDBMAXSYMTABSIZE in
scripts/genkdbsym.awk
I have one FC drive in the loop with two partition on the drive.  The
partition is done with Solaris 7.  All disk information displayed is
correct. 
The default value for KDBMAXSYMTABSIZE is 7500.  I changed to 15000 and
30000 and reload the module, same message comes out again.  By not knowing
what value I can put in, I tried to remove (or dsiable) the kdb with
"rmmod", it didn't work since kdb is not loaded as module.
Q1, what value should I set to KDBMAXSYMTABSIZE?
Q2, In case it still doesn't work, how do I remove/disble "kdb"?
Thanks!
