At it typically happens, last-minute "obviously correct" change was a mistake.
This doesn't work as intended:
LDFLAGS_vmlinux += $(call ld-option, --gc-sections)
With the above line, --gc-sections doesn't get added,
and vmlinux is not garbage collected.
It must be
LDFLAGS_vmlinux += --gc-sections
Sorry.
