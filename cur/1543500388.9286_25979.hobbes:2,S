Hi,
I noticed a constant load average of 1 on an idle system.  Changing
sleep_on_timeout() to interruptible_sleep_on_timeout() in bdflush()
looked like the right thing to try, and worked.
I also needed to export two symbols.
*** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/current/block/loop.o
	__mark_buffer_dirty
*** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/current/fs/isofs.o
	block_read_full_page
I beat on a scratch ext2 fs both with and without quotas active without
being able to stimulate any corruption.  I did run into a problem with
sys_sync() locking up in __wait_on_dquot() though.  I captured a kdb
trace before rebooting if anyone is interested.
	-Mike
