	Pray tell, why?  "One attribute per file" is the mantra here.
You really should think hard before you break it.  Simple heuristic:
would you have to parse the buffer?  Then it's wrong.

	No.  It adds complexity to an interface that is supposed to be
simple.  Now, I'm not sure what you are trying to do here, so I don't
know how it fits in.  Is it really "multiple attributes per file", or
"this attribute is a list of entries"?
	An example.  If you had to set an IP address and a port, here's
your scenarios:
[Right]
    echo "10.0.0.1" > /sys/kernel/config/subsys/item/address
    echo "8000" > /sys/kernel/config/subsys/item/port
[Wrong]
    echo 10.0.0.1\n8000" > /sys/kernel/config/subsys/item/address-and-port
	But perhaps you are not setting two distinct attributes.  I
don't understand what you are doing, so some detail would be nice.
