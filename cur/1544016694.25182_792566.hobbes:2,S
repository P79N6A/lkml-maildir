The problem is, you just littered the kernel with a ton of warnings and 
declared that fixing them is a 'much bigger task'.
It's not good to start projects like this, because they simply never 
finish. It's _much_ better to first reach a zero baseline via minimal 
fixes, then enforce 'look at the whole thing' for all _NEW_ files and 
changes.
That's how we are using checkpatch in the -tip topics, and it's working 
very nicely.
Could we please start it like that?
