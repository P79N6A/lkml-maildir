If I use more than 64MB RAM ("mem=128" or "mem=65m") memory errors
occur.
This don't happen if I boot the kernel with "mem=64m".
Under DOS I tested all the 128MB (verry detailed - the test needs more
then
4 hours) and erverything was o.k.
the system configuration is:
  Gigabyte GA 686 BXDS Mainboard (dual,scsi)
  one PII-350 
  one 128MB SDRAM Modul (PC100)
The problem occurs with all kernels (2.1.*,2.0.*,2.2.*).
any ideas?
Thanks SZ
