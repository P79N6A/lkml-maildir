Are you talking about doing tripple calls, e.g.
       pci_set_dma_mask(pdev, 0xFFFFFFFF);
       foo = pci_alloc_consistent(pdev, size, &handle);
       // Restore for upcoming streaming allocations
       pci_set_dma_mask(pdev, 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF);
Possibly Jes considered that alternative and decided that it
did not allow for sufficient performance.

Before you go for that, I'd rather see you implementing the
double/tripple calls in drivers, check for effects, THEN
go for removal of the mask. If you cannot do it, plea SGI people
to test it on SN-2 for you (or same for Intel Tiger box).

Sure it does. It blows all non-mmu ia64 out of the water.
The consistent mask looks a little distasteful to me, and I think
it should not buy us performance because consistent allocations
are not supposed to be fast. They are bad, but what you are doing
is worse: you are trying to ruin the day of legitimate users.
Please, be reasonable. Get SGI buy-in and come back.
