Indeed, there is a race condition here. It's a very small window, but it
looks like it could possibly be trouble on SMP/preempt kernels.
This patch looks OK, but it appears to still leave the race window open
in the error case (it seems to fix the non-error case, though). We
probably could actually use the ref_count field of struct request to
better fix this problem. I'll take a look at doing this, and send a
patch out in a while.
Thanks,
Paul
