Hi !
I have 3 _very_ small but ugly problems.
( with all the pre releases incl. pre9 ).
--> make menuconfig <-----------------------------
after exit + saving the kernel config I get this message:
"
Saving your kernel configuration...
The linux kernel is now configured for your setup.
if [ -r include/linux/autoconf.h ]; then \
    scripts/split-include include/linux/autoconf.h include/config; \
fi
"  ???
--> also make menuconfig <------------------------
In the sound section I enable OSS then enable 100% Soundblaster.....
and want to set the 2nd DMA; there are some undefined text in the
dialog.
I know - these are no real bugs, but as I said: it's a bit ugly.
--> framebuffer device <--------------------------
I know - it's experimental; but there is a small problem
in conjunction with the console blanker.
If there is some "running" text ( e.g. on Kernel build )
the console blanker shows some text output instead of a
blank screen.
I simulated this with pre9 and an infinite loop with some text
output in it's body.
my lilo-params: vga=788 video=vesa:ypan
--------------------------------------------------
Thanx,
	Micha
