The remedy can't just be to Cc: LKML all the time.  This would shift the
burden of directing the "general public's" attention from the domain
experts to the general public.  How will subscribers of LKML decide
which discussion threads in the huge amount of traffic are worth to
glance at?  Each of us has only a limited amount of time for LKML
consumption.
Even if you only look at the Subject: and number of postings in a
thread, how to judge whether there is a stability risk for the next -rc
in the making, without experience or personal interest in the domain?

Having a track record in list archives doesn't prevent bugs from happen,
at least not directly.  It might help to clarify who's responsible, if
the changelog doesn't tell us already, and thus might have a positive
long term effect on quality.  (I work in an industry where it is often
hard to identify responsibilities which IMO contributes to chronic
quality issues in that industry.)
Anyhow, I will try to remember to add a list archive pointer into my
future "what's in abc123-2.6.git" messages, so that those who care can
browse over the topics and threads to get at least a superficial
impression of what went on on the development list behind LKML's back.
(I usually also add Cc: LKML to discussions when I get the feeling that
the expertise and judgment on the development list might not be
sufficient during a respective stage of development --- but of course my
judgment of when to involve LKML isn't objective and perfect.  That is,
I /don't/ claim this to be the best way to handle subsystem development
discussions.)
