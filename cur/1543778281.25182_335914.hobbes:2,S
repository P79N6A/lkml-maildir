Hi all,
I downloaded and compiled 2.6.12 yesterday, I am currently running 
2.6.7-rc3.
The boot eventually hangs (irq 11, nobody cared) but since the disks 
aren't mounted yet I have no dmesg output.
So, before I can provide a decent report I need some way of getting this 
output, is there a better way than simply copying it down from the terminal?
Ta,
