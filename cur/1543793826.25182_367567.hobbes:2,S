I get something like than on 2xAthlon, but kernel 2.6.12 (some debian
version, AFAIK slightly patched). In my case XOrg (6.8.2 -> 6.9-rc)
doesn't hang but continues to work, I notice other hung process from
rising load.
Video card is Radeon 9200. When I restart X (logout to gdm), hung
process disappears.
