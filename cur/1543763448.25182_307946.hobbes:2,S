i have released the -V0.7.43-00 Real-Time Preemption patch, which can be 
downloaded from the usual place:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
this release too is a step towards more robustness. I found a bug that
caused an infinite recursion and subsequent spontaneous reboot. The bug
was once again related to lock->debug locks, so i decided to get rid of
them altogether: from now on every lock in the -RT domain is debugged.
To be able to use code that relies on incompatible properties of stock
Linux semaphores (and rwsems), i've added a new compile-time
semaphore-type mechanism that enables the easy switching from RT
semaphores to stock semaphores. I've done this conversion for all
subsystems that needed it - e.g. XFS, firewire, USB and SCSI. XFS seems
to be working much better with this approach - BYMMV.
but an unavoidable side-effect is that the whole codebase got turned 
upside down once again, so be careful and expect a few rough edges.  In 
particular keep an eye on new compile-time warnings related to 
semaphores - code that gives a warning might build but it will almost 
certainly not work.
to create a -V0.7.43-00 tree from scratch, the patching order is:
