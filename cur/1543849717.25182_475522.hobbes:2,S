No, with no contention locks stay in userspace.  And if there is 
contention, we fine-grain the locks.

I don't think they can be termed "blocking".
Most (all?) blocking calls offload work to some other device, like a 
disk or a network card, and sleep if that device has to do any 
processing.  They follow the same basic procedure:
- if data (or bufferspace) is available, read (or write) it
- otherwise, sleep
But in this case the "other device" is the processor, so the that model 
doesn't fit very well, as it *forces* a context switch.
Moreover, we need to both read and write, which ioctls() allow, but 
read()/write() require two system calls.

You can also have an additional thread to the periodic stuff.

Xen is different since you already have a context switch by going to 
domain 0.
