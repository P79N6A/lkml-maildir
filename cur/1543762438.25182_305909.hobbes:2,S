Fails to compile for me:
   CC [M]  fs/nfs/dir.o
   CC [M]  fs/nfs/inode.o
   CC [M]  fs/nfs/nfs4proc.o
fs/nfs/nfs4proc.c:2976: error: static declaration of 
'nfs4_file_inode_operations' follows non-static declaration
fs/nfs/nfs4_fs.h:179: error: previous declaration of 
'nfs4_file_inode_operations' was here
make[2]: *** [fs/nfs/nfs4proc.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [fs/nfs] Error 2
make: *** [fs] Error 2
I needed to remove this line:
extern struct inode_operations nfs4_file_inode_operations;
from  fs/nfs/nfs4_fs.h.
Patch attached.
Reuben
