I'll take one beer (or in .ru: \u043f\u0438\u0432\u043e) for each hour ;-) This is a six-pack:
299de0343c7d18448a69c635378342e9214b14af is first bad commit
diff-tree 299de0343c7d18448a69c635378342e9214b14af (from 90b54929b626c80056262d9d99b3f48522e404d0)
Marvellous tool, that git. But it took less time - for us users - when we only had to
wave in a general -rc direction...
I've not tried to back the commit out from a 2.6.14 kernel, though. Will wait for a real fix.
