Forgot to thank Dave earlier for his understanding.  I can't even mention the
4 letter acronym for the benchmark.  Sorry, I did not make the rule nor have
the power to change the rule.

OK, performance gain for this industry db benchmark is 0.3%.

So on allocation, I should always get memory from slab first, if fail then
get from mempool.  Mark the bvec appropriately where the memory came from.
On deallocating bio, check bvec flag and return memory if they came from
mempool.  Would that address your concern?
