How about:
* New Euro support and a tradition of Y2K readiness positions Linux 2.2 as
  an international operating system ready for the new millenium and beyond.
Gack. Marketspeak. Shoot me now. Hmm, waitaminute. What does Euro support
-mean- anyway? We're abbreviating too much...

Sounds a bit too techish still. How about:
* With compatibility for BSD and Windows NT filesystems, Linux 2.2 helps
  you leverage your existing UNIX and NT data today, and provides you
  with a strong upgrade path from your legacy Windows NT systems tomorrow.

Your wording seems perfectly tactful to me, although I'd probably slightly
rephrase it as:
For the adventurous, Linux 2.2 is available from the Linux Kernel Archive
<URL:
http://www.kernel.org/>,
 and users are encouraged to select the
mirror nearest them to ensure the fastest possible downloads.
Always mention a negative idea in a positive light. :-)

Ack, bad. Always attribute clearly, and the quotes above are slightly
mis-quoted. Let's keep our stuff as correct as possible, and let the media
mangle it. ;-) Here's a revision suggestion:
Josh Cohen and Vinod Valloppillil, in a competitive examination of Linux
issued by Microsoft Corporation, wrote that "Linux represents a best-of-
breen UNIX, that is trusted in mission critical applications, and - due to
it's open source code - has a long term credibility which exceeds many
other competitive OS's."
Valloppillil goes on to say, in an analysis of the Linux development
process, that the model Linux uses "poses a direct [...] platform threat
to Microsoft, particularly in the server space. Additionally, the
intrinsic parallelism and free idea exchange in [open source software] has
benefits that are not replicable with our current licensing model." He
continues, stating that "Linux has been deployed in mission critical,
commercial environments with an excellent pool of public testimonials."

Freedom of the press. She stated it, without making any request to keep it
"off the record" until after it had been published several times. A bit
too late, I do believe. IANAL. Someone should ask a legal counsel about
this.

Another one worth slipping in there, for completeness:
Open Source is a trademark of the Open Source Initiative.

Absolutely. Just leaving URLs there isn't really very handy. Also
deperately needed here are non-Internet press contact points. Addresses
and phone numbers especially. I'd suggest Linux International, if they're
willing to take the brunt of it.
> Open Source Organisation (?)	
http://www.opensource.org/
"Open Source Initiative", or OSI.
> Apache WWW Server (?)		
http://www.apache.org/
"The Apache Group" appears to be the name they use to refer to the team,
and "The Apache Project" is the title the use for referring to the
initiative. Not sure which is more appropriate for a press release.
> SAMBA				
http://www.samba.org/
Their press release for Samba 2.0 refers to them as "The Samba Team".
(As an aside, is anyone else rather impressed with how well this press
release is shaping up? Even press statements and literature seem to do
well from an open development model...;-)
