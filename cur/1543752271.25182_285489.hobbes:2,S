Limiting to positive nice values are needed too. At leased i need such
thing. Normal users are only allowed to increase the nice value (lower
prio). If a user job runs at nice 15 they can't renice it to 5. I get
about 3 calls a week to do this as root.
And the presentation of the usual nice values can be done in userspace.
pamlimits and ulimit already converts values (min -> s, KiB -> Bytes).
And separating the nice and RT part is useful to prevent confusion in
userspace tools and for the admin.
I patched PAM which allows the setting of nice and realtime rlimits in
limits.conf:
nice goes from 19 to -20 (internally converted to 0-39).
realtime from 0 - 99.
