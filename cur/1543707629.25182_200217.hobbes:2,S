Thanks Suresh, that did it. I bet it's the GDT_ENTRIES change in segment.h
that was the real cause of my system not booting.
That's what I meant with having all parts of the original cset undone,
except for the *.h file changes. Even with only the *.h parts of the cset
included in my tree would cause the system _not_ boot.
Let me know if you need more patches tested, gotta do some work now that the
system runs again :)
Anybody got any information why the ioapic interrupt programming fails on VIA
based K8 boards, BTW?
Regards,
Tony
