From: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@woody.linux-foundation.org>
This reverts commit 99a10a60ba9bedcf5d70ef81414d3e03816afa3f.
As per Hugh Dickins:
  "Nadia Derbey has reported that mmap of /dev/kmem no longer works with
   the kernel virtual address as offset, and Franck has confirmed that
   his patch came from a misunderstanding of what an offset means to
   /dev/kmem - whereas his patch description seems to say that he was
   correcting the offset on a few plaforms, there was no such problem to
   correct, and his patch was in fact changing its API on all platforms."
