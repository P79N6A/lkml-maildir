Hello. Upgrading from 2.6.0 to 2.6.1 gave me the problem that my 
apostrophe/asterisk key didn't work (norwegian kbd layout, connected via 
USB). That is, I press the key, and nothing happens. The showkey program 
tells me this key has keycode 84.
So I check the patch file, and find that in the file:
   drivers/char/keyboard.c
and the section:
   static unsigned short x86_keycodes[256] =
the line:
- 80, 81, 82, 83, 43, 85, 86, 87, 88,115,119,120,121,375,123, 90,
                   ^^
was changed to:
+ 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 93, 86, 87, 88, 94, 95, 85,259,375,260, 90,
                   ^^
Now, I am nowhere near a kernel hacker, but I thought I'd try and change 
84 back to 43 (of course without any good reason other than "let's see 
what happens"), and it seemed to work.
I don't know what this means, but I thought maybe that some of you who 
actually _know_ a thing or two about the kernel could make something of 
all of this...
