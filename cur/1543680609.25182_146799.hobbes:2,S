OK, I'm finally getting around to actually commenting, this has been a niggling issue for
a while...

Yes, this patch says "not ready for prime time, it breaks things".
In particular, this gives the device-mapper userspace indigestion, because the
ioctl passes something other than a 64-bit kdev_t in from libdevmapper. Upshot
is that the LVM2 'vgchange -ay' fails gloriously.
Workaround:  Compile the devmapper/LVM stuff with a private copy of include/
linux/kdev_t.h that matches the one the kernel uses.  No, I didn't actually get
that to work, so I backed out the 64-bit patch...
(And no, the recent devmapper/LVM2 stuff posted doesn't fix this).
