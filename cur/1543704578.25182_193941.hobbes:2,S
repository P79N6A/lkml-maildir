I was startled when I bought a power meter to find that my computers
and even some monitors consume power when switched off.  I don't mean
"soft" off - even with the mechanical switch in the off position they
still consume significant power.
My AMD box consumes about 15W of power when the mechanical switch on
its power supply is off.  About 35W when the mechanical switch is on
but the computer is in the "soft off" state (i.e. what you get when
you ask it to turn itself off).
