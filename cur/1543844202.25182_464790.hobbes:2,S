Look at what the patches do. These are not only for hard partitioning
of memory per container but also those that share memory (eg. you might
want each to share 100MB of memory, up to a max of 80MB for an individual
container).
The nodes+cpusets stuff doesn't seem to help with that because you
with that because you fundamentally need to track pages on a per
container basis otherwise you don't know who's got what.
Now if, in practice, it turns out that nobody really needed these
features then of course I would prefer the cpuset+nodes approach. My
point is that I am not in a position to know who wants what, so I
hope people will come out and discuss some of these issues.
