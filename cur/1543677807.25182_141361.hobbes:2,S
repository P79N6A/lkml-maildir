	x86-generic in 2.5.72 does not compile, because
include/asm-i386/mach-generic/mach_apic.h does not define
enable_apic_mode().  Although I kludged around this, by
just defining enable_apic_mode() as nothing (since it is
apparently nothing for all x86 platforms except es7000),
I imagine that the correct definition is
#define enable_apic_mode (genapic->enable_apic_mode)
	...along with some other changes to declare
genapic->enable_apic_mode and initialize it for each platform
type.
