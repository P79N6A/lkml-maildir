You misunderstand what names and objects are (at least what i mean...).
PID "numbers" are (in a way) overcommitted. PID 30000 is valid does not
mean there may be 30000 processes on the system.
Valid PIDs are never 'overcommitted': pid = fork() always returns
a pid that is valid, and points to an "object" (process) which has all
necessary resources allocated to. You never get a pid, with the kernel
NOT creating the object until you access the pid (COW = clone on write?).
With 31bit PIDs, the are 32768 *names* for processes. No relation with
NPROC (or whatever you call maximum number of system processes).
A virtual address is just a name. brk() gives you more names. No more,
no less.  Objects (page-frames, disk blocks) are allocated *later*,
when you refer to them, depending on how you're referring to them. On
a COW page, a read access won't allocate any object (page-frame).

Addresses *are* names. By definition. Virtual addresses point to "pages",
which in turn are logical objects. Some real "storage" (a page-frame or 
a disk block) may or may not be mapped to a page.

We're not discussing quotas here. You can have quotas with or without 
swap overcommiting. And you can have quotas on 'names' or on 'objects'.
Not all namespaces are infinite. Given a limit of 3GB as address space,
you may be unable to access 8GB of RAM. You'll run out of 'names' before
running out of 'objects'.
