 In the case of Orinoco USB devices, we even have fxload to download the
 ez-usb firmware, but the device doesn't change identity on firmware
 load, so both the hotplug helper and the driver end up accessing the
 device at the same time and it blows up.

 Yes, that is the idea, although "hotplug" support is not implemented
 jet. I wanted some more feedback before expending more time on this.
 Taking a closer look, it should be easy to hook into the regular
 hotplug mechanism. I could just run '/sbin/hotplug firmware' setting
 FW_NAME=image_name in the environment and wait for it to finish like
 kmod does with modprobe.
 And if I also run it with 'ACTION=unload' when the firmware is not
 needed, it can easily be removed to save memory.

 On the other hand, there are already many drivers in the kernel that
 include firmware in headers, keyspan, io_edgeport, dabusb, ser_a2232,
 sym53c8xx_2, ...
 Something like fwfs would allow the removal of such firmware and save
 memory.
 If the firmware is not needed to boot, it could simply be removed from
 the kernel and be loaded from userspace.
 If the firmware is needed to boot, the driver could declare the
 firmware as __init data and register it on boot via fwfs_write_default.
 And after boot it could just be unlinked from fwfs recovering the
 memory.
 Currently the firmware image is copied into kmalloced memory then a
 drivers asks for the image, but if memory is such an issue, I'll look
 for a way to use the page cache data directly all the time. I'll take a
 closer look to the vmalloc code.
 Have a nice day
