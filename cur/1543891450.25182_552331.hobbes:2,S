I've got a cp437 "DOS" font loaded[1], and giving a glance at
/usr/share/kbd/unimaps/cp437.uni tells me right away:
	0x01 U+263A
So I create U+263A in joe (ESC ' x 2 6 3 a), it displays fine (the
smiley character), and I can copy/paste it using GPM without
problems. Though, I have that patch[2] in my kernel. Can you check
if it works if you apply it?
