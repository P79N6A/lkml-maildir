Can you check that the message above is _really_ the output of your
native kernel ? I have not checked gentoo's sources but the real vanilla
kernel can not issue this string.

You can send for both working/non-working after module insertion (wait
for a few seconds):
- complete dmesg (the beginning of it could be in /var/log/dmesg or such)
- lspci -vx
- lsmod
- ifconfig -a
- ethtool eth0
- cat /proc/interrupts
- source code
Also:
- brand name of the motherboard
- the name given by USR to the adapter (check the box)
I do not mind if the info is mailed, available on some web site or stuffed
at bugzilla.kernel.org. Please Cc: netdev@oss.sgi.com on further messages.
