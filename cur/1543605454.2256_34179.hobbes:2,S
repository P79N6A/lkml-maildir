Good point. Anybody else want to chime in here? For linux-kernel's 
purposes at least, a BSD licensed piece of code with no source is about 
as useful as ice-cream to an eskimo. Of course creating BSD licensed 
binaries from closed source is kind of silly. Say we see an external 
module (one not distributed with the kernel source) that identifies 
itself as BSD licensed loaded into somebodies' kernel then ask the 
provider for source and he refuses. Rightfully that kernel should have 
been marked tainted. Is their anything in the licensing that would allow 
us to say that specifying a BSD license in the MODULE_LICENSE tag refers 
to source distribution? Or is that implied?

What's in a name? If it's called MODULE_LICENSE or MODULE_SOURCE if it's 
defined to mean availability and licensing of module source, that's the 
important distinction. Further, EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL is a separate issue 
regardless, it allows us a definite way to specify "private" interfaces.

If it becomes public knowledge that a binary-module vendor distributes 
modules marked as BSD licensed but the source is unavailable that would 
be bad PR for them. First they would probably be ignored by 
linux-kernel. They should also be branded as liars for disingenuosly 
marking their products.

I don't think anybody wants to disallow linking of GPL compatible code 
with Linux. Given that the FSF thinks that BSD-no-adv is compatible, I'd 
tend to agree with them. If MODULE_LICENSE is to be used as your 
"MODULE_SOURCE" idea is (which I think it is), it's not an issue. As far 
as programmers releasing BSD source, they seem to be OK with it, check 
the source yourself: 
http://lxr.linux.no/search?string=MODULE_LICENSE.

Making access control mandatory with source code availability is hard. 
Nobody said this was a be-all, end-all solution, it simply helps screen 
those that would take advantage of people's limited time and effort. It 
depends partly on respect and good-will, so if a vendor wants to violate 
that trust and flaunt arrogance to the folks of the linux community, so 
be it.

The intent is to more clearly define the gracious exception that has 
been made for binary-only module vendors. If we decide to disallow the 
use of BSD licensed code (when everybody else in the world can use it) 
that's our loss. In the end we want to respect other people's copyrights 
and have our's respected in turn.
