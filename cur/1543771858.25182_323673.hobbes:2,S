Subject: yenta_socket: no PCI interrupts after resume if intel-agp loaded on HP 1105

If I boot a kernel without any modules loaded and then load intel-agp, I
can successfully suspend and resume this machine via ACPI. However, the
b44 module is then unable to determine its MAC address correctly, and
ipw2100 claims that it can't find a device. yenta_socket gives 
Yenta : Enabling burst memory read transactions
Yenta: Using CSCINT to route CSC interrupts to PCI
Yenta: Routing CardBus interrupts to PCI
Yenta TI: socket 0000:02:06.0, mfunc 0x00001000, devctl 0x66
Yenta TI: socket 0000:02:06.0 probing PCI interrupt failed, trying to fix
Yenta TI: socket 0000:02:06.0 falling back to parallel PCI interrupts
Yenta TI: socket 0000:02:06.0 no PCI interrupts. Fish. Please report.
The only output from the AGP driver is:
agpgart: Detected an Intel 855PM Chipset.
agpgart: AGP aperture is 32M @ 0xe2000000
If I have all of these drivers loaded at suspend, resume fails. Without
intel-agp, I can suspend and resume happily (well, X won't start after
resume, but that's potentially an entirely separate issue)
