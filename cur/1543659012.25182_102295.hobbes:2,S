Low level drivers are basically sorted.
The main problems are
  - Incorrect locking all over the place
  - Incorrect timings on some phases
  - Some ioctls can cause crashes due to locking
  - ISAPnP IDE doesn't work right now
  - Flaws in error recovery paths in certain situations
  - Lots of random oopses on boot/remove that were apparently
    introduced by the kobject/sysfs people and need chasing
    down. (There are some non sysfs ones mostly fixed)
  - ide-scsi needs some cleanup to fix switchover ide-cd/scsi
    (We can't dump ide-scsi)
  - Unregister path has races which cause all the long
    standing problems with pcmcia and prevents pci unreg
  - PCI IDE driver registration needs busy checks
  - PCI layer needs some stuff from 2.4
  - PCI layer in 2.4/2.5 needs an IRQ bug fixing
  - ACPI doesn't seem to handle compatibility IRQ mode
  - We don't handle a few errata (MWDMA on 450NX for example)
  - IDE raid hasn't been ported to 2.5 at all yet
Thats off the top of my head right now.

No, although some don't show up in the same ways in 2.4 - eg the pcmcia
unload race is rare in 2.4 for other reasons. Endianism should all
be cured in 2.4, and I sent that to Linus. The PCI i/o assignment code
in 2.4 is done. I hope to have some of the locking and also the timing
path work Ross Biro has done in for 2.4.22 proper

Which works really well with all the IRQ paths on it

The refcounting bugs are/were in the ldisc stuff. I thought the
bluetooth folks (Max and co) fixed that one
If we can lock_kernel the tty layer for now (I'm bothered about
the ldisc end of tht which is IRQ context) then great, tty scaling
is suddenelly a 2.7 problem.
