No, improving printing support is something that the distribution vendors are
supposed to provide.
I think you're under the assumption that this support were to be placed in the
kernel, it would then become ubiquitous.  That may be true, but it's irrelevant.
Instead, what is needed is a sort of "standard" that indicates what every Linux
distribution should have in addition to the kernel.  And that's something that's
being addressed by organization such as the Linux Standard Base
(
http://www.linuxbase.org/
).  You should ask them about it.
