With the current implementation in the kernel (and considering that 
CONFIG_FORCED_INLINING was implemented in a way that it never had any 
effect), __always_inline and inline are currently equivalent.
__always_inline is mostly an annotation that really bad things might 
happen if the code doesn't get inlined.
But I'm not sure whether such a distinction is required at all - the 
rule of thumb should be that static functions in headers should be 
inline (otherwise, they belong into a C file), and functions in C files 
should never be marked inline. [1]

[1] For the latter there might be a handful of exceptions in the whole 
    kernel in real fastpath code, but usually gcc knows best when to 
    inline a function - and we have a global CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE 
    knob for influencing the decision.
