With a bit more experiments, I have this behaviour:
(I hold the kerne lock, daemonize(), and release the kernel lock, then do
my probe thing which takes a few seconds, and let the thread die by itself)
 - When started during boot (low PID (9)) It becomes a zombie
 - When started from a process that quits after sending the ioctl,
   it is correctly "garbage collected".
 - When started from a process that stays around, it becomes a zombie too
So something is not working, or I'm missing something obvious, or whatever...
Any clue ?
Ben.
