Sorry for not following up: the packet arrives correctly to the
receiving host when it's running, the problem is that it doesn't wake
up. As I have changed the switch at the same time (gigabit upgrade)
maybe when the host is powered off the switch doesn't forward the magic
packet ?
I'll dig the old 10/100 hub and try again.
Thanks,
