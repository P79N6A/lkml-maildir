by default it's still old good ext3 without extents. user should
enable it explicitly. for him, this means the feature is ready
to be used anytime. the only thing he needs is to (re)mount fs
with the option. for us, this means: a) a single source tree -
easy to maintain b) we must be clear with user that the feature
isn't backward compatible
thanks, Alex
PS. in the end this is just ext3 with one more feature ...
