Not at all.  It's a standard compile option, and once it's enabled the
kernel will let you redirect console to a serial port by using a boot
option such as "console=ttyS0,9600".  That takes care of the kernel
console output, but you can also make init send all of the user console
stuff (the boot logs) to the serial port by making /dev/console point to
the appropriate serial device.  Even singleuser login will then go to
serial.  Options also exist on LILO for serial console.
