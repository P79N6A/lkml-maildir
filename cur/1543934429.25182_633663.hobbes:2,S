The IOWAIT time is the IDLE time that was spent waiting
for I/O. (meaning that there were no tasks running, but some were waiting on I/O)
Thus if you have another task that is not I/O bound, it can run in that time,
and ideally, you shouldn't notice any I/O slowdown, but the iowait time will decrease.
It wasn't the case before CFS introduction. I did few tests that showed almost 50% slowdown 
when running another task in that iowait time.
It is not longer a problem with CFS.
