I think we could restrict this to allow ioctl configuration only if
there's just a single active virtual dev [excluding some special cases
like changing the mode which would (see above) require deactivating one
and activating another virtual dev. or is that not possible without
screwing up naming etc? that might get tricky if we disallow mode
changing, but can probably be worked around easier than allowing mode
changing, especially since this is to be deprecated]

If you want the old userspace API to 'just work' you have to create one
default wlan device at WiPHY init.

It definitely should, in any case.
