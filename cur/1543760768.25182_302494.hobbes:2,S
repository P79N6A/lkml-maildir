Putting it in userland would make it impossible to debug what's wrong
with the system if there's a kernel error, since userland will die long
before it can spit out anything useful.
The primary purpose of these things is to make a distribution look
pretty while booting.  Lots of people complain that Linux distros look
"old fashioned" or something because they don't show little dancing
girls during early boot.
I should think the primary features you need here are:
* Can display some pretty looking thing with a logo
* If there's a problem during boot (userspace error, oops, panic, etc.)
  then it should become a regular console able to scroll back over the
  boot-time spew.
I don't think a user-space version can do that for anything except
userspace errors, so a kernel console is better.
