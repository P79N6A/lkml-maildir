Version 2.6.2 of perfctr, the Linux/x86 performance
monitoring counters driver, is now available at the usual
place: 
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/perfctr/
I've now also made .rpm files for the user-space components.
Please try them out and report any glitches.
Version 2.6.2, 2003-11-23
- libperfctr.so is now installed with proper versioning.
- ABI control and info structures padded to accommodate some
  extensions without breaking application/library binary
  compatibility. ABI version incremented to '5'.
- Driver checks that only P4 models <= 2 use IQ_ESCR0/1.
- Added support for Fedora Core 1's 2.4.22-1.2115.nptl kernel.
- Driver compile fix for AMD64 in SMP 2.6 kernels.
