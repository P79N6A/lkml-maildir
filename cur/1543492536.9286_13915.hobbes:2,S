Well that's not valid default route. That's a host route, should be
a network route like this:
drinkel% route -n
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
195.64.64.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 ippp0
0.0.0.0         0.0.0.0         0.0.0.0         U     0      0        0 ippp0
