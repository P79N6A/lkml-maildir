> derive MVME147_SCSI from MVME147 & SCSI
It seems that the preferred semantics would be:
default MVME147_SCSI from MVME147 & SCSI
That way the platform defines sane defaults, but no flexibility has been
taken away.
Presumably many of these defaulted options would also be ones that would
be configured not to be changeable in novice mode. The novice gets the
vanilla platform defaults without being bothered by detailed options,
and can switch to expert mode if they need more control. The experts get
all the options presented, but also get to benefit from the smart
platform defaults.
