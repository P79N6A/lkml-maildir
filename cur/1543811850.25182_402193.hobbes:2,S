Ok, I'll change this, it is ackward wording.

Good point, added.

Yeah, I wonder if some of the things in that file can be moved to be
individual files in this directory too.

I'd like to just discourage their use without the helper at all, as that
is what the developers of that interface is saying already.  I guess you
could want to implement your own alsa kernel interface if you really
want to :)
Anyway, I've added more wording here for that, thanks.

Good idea, added.

Hm, good idea, syscalls should even do this...
thanks again for your input, I'll repost an updated version based on
these comments and the others.
