 Hello, Greg.
 Here are the regenerated patches with the fix.
01_mkobj_inline.patch
        Make module.mkobj inline.  As this is simpler and what's
        usually done with kobjs when it's representing an entity.
02_module_attribute_extension.patch
        Modify module_attribute show/store methods to accept self
        argument to enable further extensions.
03_module_sections_attr_grp.patch
        Reimplement section attributes using attribute group.  This
        makes more sense, for, while they reside in a separate
        subdirectory, they belong to the ownig module and their
        lifetime exactly equals the lifetime of the owning module,
        and it's simpler.
04_module_paramters_attr_grp.patch
        Reimplement parameter attributes using attribute group.
	This makes more sense, for, while they reside in a separate
        subdirectory, they belong to the ownig module and their
        lifetime exactly equals the lifetime of the owning module,
        and it's simpler.
 Thanks.
