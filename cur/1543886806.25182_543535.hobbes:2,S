I've just quickly looked at the patch and it seems fine - it's using 
mmap()'s randomization functionality in such a way that it maps the the 
main executable of (specially compiled/linked) ET_DYN binaries onto a 
random address (in cases in which mmap() is allowed to perform a 
randomization). Which is what we want, I'd guess.
Jan, would you care to update the patch with proper Changelog entry?
However, I seem to get "soft" hang on boot with this patch, approximately 
at the time the init should be executed. The system is not completely 
stuck - interrupts are delivered, keyboard is working, alt-sysrq-t dumps 
proper output, but userspace doesn't seem to get started. This happens on 
i386, didn't try on other archs.
