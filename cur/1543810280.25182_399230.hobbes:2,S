No, let's not even decide on that :).
I think where we've come to, is that there is no *important* difference
between virtualising on a per-process or a per-process family basis, so
long as you can suitably arrange arbitrary families it is equivalent to
the "pure" method of strict per-process virtualisation as Eric has been
implementing.

Yes, and I'm hoping that with the central structure there it should be
easy to start re-basing the Linux VServer patch as well as openvz and
any other similar technology people have.
Then we can cherry-pick features from any of the 'competing' solutions
in this space.
I have a preliminary patch, and hope to have a public submission this
week.
Sam.
