I've re-based my timekeeping patch queue ontop of Roman's recent NTP and
div64 patches. I've been a little short on time, so I've not been able
to get them all tested (ntp testing takes a number of hours), but they
do build and I wanted to get some feedback on the re-base.
My apologies to Ingo for sitting on his patches for this long.
I'll get a test setup going over the weekend to make sure all is well.
The total patch queue is large, so while folks probably won't try it
themselves, here's the full series I'm using to build:
