I think it had better be FIFO for now. If its not, you're
making the worst case latency worse. It requires a lot of
careful testing to get something like that working right.
You have some good ideas, and quite possibly they would be
worth implementing, but the behaviour of the code is quite
complex, especially when you take into account its affect
on the io scheduler.
