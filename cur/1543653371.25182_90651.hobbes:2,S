I give it a big thumbs-up.  Between the NUMAQs and the big xSeries 
machines, we have a lot of slow rebooters.  The 16GB intel boxes take 
at about 5 minutes to get back to the bootloader after a reboot, and 
the 4 and 8-quad NUMAQ's take closer to 10.
The IBM machines I've tried it on are a 4-way and 8-way PIII.  They 
both have aic7xxx cards and the 8-way has a ServeRAID 4 controller. 
They have a collection of acenic, e1000, pcnet32 and eepro100 net 
cards.  All seem to work just fine.
The NUMAQ is another story, though.  I get nothing after "Starting new 
kernel".  But, I wasn't expecting much.  The NUMAQ is pretty weird 
hardware and god knows what is actually happening.  I'll try it some 
more when I'm more confident in what I'm doing.
What's the deal with "FIXME assuming 64M of ram"?  I was a little 
surprised when my 16GB machine started to OOM as I did a "make -j8 
bzImage" :)  Why is it that you need the memory size at load time?
