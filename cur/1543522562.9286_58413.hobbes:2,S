} 
} I know, which is why I said (to you in private) 256K is a bad idea
} (fragmentation in a few minutes after using the box).
} 
} But, even better than your idea (dare I say :) is to have chunked
} allocation and using kmalloc() all the time, something like (roughly):
} 
} #define POLL_PER_CHUNK  16000
} #define POLL_NCHUNKS    8
} 
} struct pollfd * fds[POLL_NCHUNKS];
} 
} nchunks = 0;
}         nleft = nfds;
}         while (nleft > POLL_PER_CHUNK) {
}                 fds[nchunks] = kmalloc(POLL_PER_CHUNK * sizeof(struct
} pollfd));
}                 if (fds[nchunks] == NULL) {
}                         int k;
} 
}                         printk(KERN_ERR "poll(): can't kmalloc a
} chunk\n");
}                         for (k = nchunks-1; k > 0; k--)
}                                 kfree(fds[k]);
}                         goto out;
}                 }
}                 nchunks++;
}                 nleft -= POLL_PER_CHUNK;
}         }
}         if (nleft) {
}                 fds[nchunks] = kmalloc(nleft * sizeof(struct pollfd));
}                 nchunks++;
}         }
} 
} but do_poll() will need to be changed to accomodate passing new type of
} arguments (and number of full chunks) so I intend to implement this in the
} evening at home, if you guys agree with the approach in principle?
} 
I tried something similar with linked-lists...It "looked" fine to me, but
caused polling to become...strange...It would continually poll on some
fds over and over. I could find no real explanation for it, so I dropped
that line.
Your solution would be nice, however you are introducing loops which
could be a small performance hit.
