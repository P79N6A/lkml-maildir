I tried kernel 2.4.8 and also had an oops.  An earlier kernel w/out devfs did
not cause an oops.  I plan on making a non-devfs 2.4.8 kernel to see if the
oops does not happen.

I do not know if the devfs info, in the oops (ksymoops output) data below
indicates a problem w/devfs or not.  Maybe you can tell?

Here is the output from ksymoops

After watching what happens during the boot process I started turning off
things that might be touching the floppy device (at boot), such as autofs.
What finally stopped the Oops was to comment out the floppy entry in
/etc/fstab:
	/dev/fd0 /floppy auto defaults,user,noauto 0 0
I can then load the floppy module after boot, and successfully access the
floppy device w/o any problems.  The oops happened when the mountall script
(Debian testing) was running:
	mount -avt nonfs,noproc,nosmbfs
Devfsd is started way before mountall is ran so I do not know why it is
causing problems.
