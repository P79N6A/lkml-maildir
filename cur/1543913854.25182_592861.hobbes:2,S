Yeah I know. Those are the non trivial ones and the boot/compressed one
might be split forever. The pci Makefile has link order problems
(initcall order wreckage) and the main Makefile as well. Needs more

It's way better than the ifneq(...) stuff and completely understandable
at least for me. I'd like to see that change, it is helpful on a bunch
of other places in the kernel as well.
