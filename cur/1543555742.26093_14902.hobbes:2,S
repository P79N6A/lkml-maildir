Can somebody stop this train load of bunk?
Uninitialized global variables always have a initial value of
zero.  Static or otherwise.  Period.
Anybody with more than a week's experience programming knows this.
It's idiomatic.  Just as in English one says, "Go away!" knowing that
"You", the implied subject of the imperative sentence, will be
understood.
Andries, please devote your impressive energy to fixing _real_ bugs.
This kind of argument is best left until we're _really_ low on other
things to do.
