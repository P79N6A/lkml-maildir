How do you know if it's the serial that's causing the hang rather than
the virtual console subsystem?
Your original description seems to imply that the machine only hung after
you switched from VC1 to VC3, and then you found you couldn't switch back
to VC1.  To me, that sounds virtual console related rather than serial
related.  Especially if you can reproduce it at this exact point in time
every time.
Have you tried sysrq-p or sysrq-t to get a trace/thread info from the
kernel?
