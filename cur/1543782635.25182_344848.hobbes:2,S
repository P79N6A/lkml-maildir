I don't think I'm obligated to answer every
single person who pipes into a thread. People who
say "show me your config and dmesg" are not
useful. Linux has long had a philisophical
problem of dropping packets as a "performance
feature", and we've already established I think
that you can't eliminate it altogether, if you
read the thread carefully.
Also, if you're on a slow machine you can't
download faster than your machine can handle it,
because the "server on a gig network" can't send
faster then you tell it to, not matter how fast
it is. You'll never overrun a machine with 1 or 2
or 5 connections. Having a clue how things work
is important.
