I don't think it's a problem with the size. Here is the
`lspci` output after I hacked a Rtc module to use 16 megabytes
of data space. It took about 1/4 second to load (`time insmod Rtc.ko`).

Rtc                 16783748  0

The PPC might be a bit slower, but not as slow as you are
seeing. I suspect that you have something that is 'waiting'
for initialization.
