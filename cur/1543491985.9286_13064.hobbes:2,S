Hi;
I got several video frame grabber boards that I wrote drivers for and I
used the  memcpy_tofs
call when this driver ran under kernel versions 2.0.*, Well now under
kernel version 2.2.5 I get this problem
[root@rscope epix]# insmod svm.o
svm.o: unresolved symbol memcpy_tofs
Now I got a few other issues as follows.
Any help on what I should be reading for instructions on moving my
driver to the 2.2.5 kernel is apreciated... Thanks
[root@rscope epix]#  gcc -c -D__KERNEL__ -DMODULE -O2 svm.c -o svm.o
