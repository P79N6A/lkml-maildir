No. "I don't care where you live" is not the same as "I think you live in
Greece". Note they say "if the condition is detected", not "shall check for
the following condition". I understand that to mean that if in the course
of business you happen to stumble upon the condition, you must say so in
the way stated. If you don't care, you won't notice and so you have nothing
to report.

Better don't. It is just not worth it.

And said processes could very well do a getcwd(3) as first order of
business in order to be able to cheat later on.
What does make sense is root starting a process as an ordinary user in a
directory where the process isn't allowed to x one of the ancestor
directories. What could said process ever learn this way that might
compromise security? It could leak info to say, /tmp by just calling it by
name in any case.
I understand the idea of "need to know", but IMHO if a process cares for
its CWD it has a need to know. And if this is a real no-no, you probably
have half a dozen other reasons to put it in a chroot(2) jail anyway.
