Arjan,
Thanks for the review. Please see my replies inline.

t3_slow_intr_handler() processes non-data events such as board errors.
In line interupt and MSI mode, the intr handler deals with both data
and non-data events and calls t3_slow_intr_handler for the latter.
In MSI-X mode, t3_async_intr_handler() is registered to deal with these
non-data interrupts exclusively.

These attributes are really device specific.
The net layer does not support device specific attributes.

it will be removed.

They are used to parameter the HW:
register access, configuration of queue sets, on board memory 
configuration,
firmware load, etc ...

Will fix both comment and related code.

This is how most of the existing drivers behave.
