FWIW, on my Via EPIA (pre-Nehemiah C3) Wal-Mart box, I see NFS (?) bugs
as well.  I can mount just fine and do an 'ls' of a remote dir... but
any attempt to actually transfer data causes the entire mount to hang in
disk wait.
I swapped out NICs several times (and verified the NICs in other boxes)
but can reproduce this behavior quite easily.
ssh, ftp, and other services work flawlessly... it's just NFS.
I even tried tcp instead of udp, to no avail.
