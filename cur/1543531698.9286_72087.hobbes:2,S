2.3.50 had a broken non-alignment of the descriptor rings, that was fixed
(in or before pre2).
There are a few changes between pre2 and pre3, if you take the pre2 tree
and apply the testing/pre3-7.gz patch does that work?
(the driver should identify itself as v1.03a-LK1.1.2)
The 2.3.99-pre3 contains the changes made to use the new dynamic DMA
mapping interface (Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt).
What card do you have (+ dmesg output for the card)?
x86 system?

... but the "final" 2.3.99-pre3 has David Millers (by him untested) fixes
for this.
I added Justin to the Cc since he can also see problems with this version
of the driver and he is much more likely than me to solve this. For me
things are fine, unfortunately.
