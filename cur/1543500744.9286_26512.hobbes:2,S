The change that triggered these probs is that
spin_lock_irq(&lock) on UP mapped
  previously   --> cli();
  now          --> local_irq_disable();spin_lock(&lock);
                                         +--> (void)(&lock);
ie. "lock" must exist.
To cope with this "existance" requirement, just remove the #ifdef's around
masq_port_lock. 
And YES, in UP that cli() (or equiv.) MUST exist (masq_port variable IS
changed from U-space [ip_masq_user module] and obviously from kernel [bh]).
