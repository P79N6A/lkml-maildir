  Yeah, I had a 5000 iterations test run last night which failed with
one of the runs having a final ball position of 1. So it's not yet
perfect. I think we're hitting the same bug as with the O(1) scheduler
in 2.6.21-rt8.
  It seems that the more CPUs there are, the easier it is to reproduce.
Hopefully I should have access to a quad dual core box soon now to
verify this.
  One more thing, the bug seems even harder to reproduce if I have
a logdev LD_MARK (direct marker, no kprobe) in context_switch().
  Ingo, Thomas, any ideas, opinions? It looks like there might be a race in
the RT balancing code that prevents pulling the highest prio task and
instead selects a lower one to run.
  In the mean time I'll continue poring over the 2.6.21-rt8 scheduler
to try to find something.
  Sébastien.
