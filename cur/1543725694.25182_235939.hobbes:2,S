You *do* realize that the kernel in the Fedora development tree is actually *ahead*
of the released kernel.org tree, right?
The current kernel-2.6.7-1.494.src.rpm is based on 2.6.8-rc1-bk5, with a bunch of
RedHat/Fedora patches on top of that.
And the 2.6.5-1.358 kernel that shipped in Fedora Core 2 is actually a 2.6.6-rc3-bk3
with patches on top of that.
I think you meant the RHEL series of kernels - current there is 2.4.21-15.0.3.EL,
with backports of security/bug fixes.
