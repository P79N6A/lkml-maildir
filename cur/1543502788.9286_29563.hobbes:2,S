Greetings!  This does indeed seem to be the case.  The host
alltel2-gw.customer.ALTER.NET seems to be blocking icmp, and thereby
prohibiting web access to www.sfnb.com for those who must traverse a
link with mtu less than 1500.  This icmp blockage seems to have been
started within the last week or so.  We've managed to change our link to
1500 as a work-around, but the issue still remains for those unable to
ensure a clean 1500 mtu path through the router.  
I had thought the issue must lie in the IP masq code, as the web page
does load from the masquerading host itself, but had overlooked the
fact that the icmp path mtu discovery bit only needs take place if
your immediate link has an mtu higher than some link further down the
path, as is the case *behind* our masquerading firewall, but not on
it, of course.
Thanks for the help, and sorry for the false alarm about the Linux
masq code.  Its truly a marvel!  Good work, everyone!
