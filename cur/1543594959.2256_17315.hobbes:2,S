Well, that would explain it then.  (So $$ isn't actually an environment 
variable, it just looks like one?  I had my threads calling a seperate 
function...)

Except that this spawns a new child and gives me the PID of the child, which 
lives for maybe a tenth of a second...
Maybe I could do something with eval...?
Either way, I switched the project in question to python.

A couple people emailed me and pointed out I had to set IFS=$'\n', (often 
after first saying "there's no way to do that" and then correcting themselves 
towards the end of the message...)
My first attempt to do it was to pipe the data into a sub-function do read a 
line at a time and store the results in an array.  (Seemed pretty 
straightforward.)
Except there's no way to get that array back out of the function, and that IS 
documented at the end of the bash man page.
As I said: Python.

I was trying to convert the lines into an array I could then iterate through.

Hmmm...  If that avoids the need to export the array from one shell instance 
to another, maybe it'd work.  (I'm not really doing echo, I was doing 
var[$i]="line", with some other misc stuff.)
But I got it to work via IFS, and that's good enough for right now.

I came to the same conclusion, but would like for more than one person to be 
able to work on the same piece of code, so it's python.  (Or PHP if Carl's 
the one who gets around to porting it first. :)  But in the meantime, the 
shell script is now working.  Thanks everybody...)
Back to talking about the kernel.:)
