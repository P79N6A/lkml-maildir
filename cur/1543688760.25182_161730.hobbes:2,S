I've done similar things with kernbench before (always using 2.95 to
run the test, but comparing kernels compiled with gcc 2.95 vs 3.2 vs 3.3,
and -Os vs -O2, etc). Summary was that 3.x takes *much* longer to compile
the kernel, and produces worse code (though 3.3 is almost back up to
the performance of 2.95, and is better than 3.2). -O2 is better than -Os, 
at least on a machine with 2MB L2 cache. Search the archives for results 
I posted if you want, but I never bothered graphing them.

I'd just throw away any of the subtests that give you > 1% variations,
deriving anything meaning from crap data is hard (and dubious). I have
similar problems with some of the results in lmbench - Larry suggested
setting "ENOUGH=" or something, which helped a few tests, but most of
them still aren't stable enough to be useful to me.
I'd also use something "bigger" than just a microbenchmark - you need to
exercise a realistic set of the kernel functions in order to see space 
vs time tradeoffs, etc. If you want to see whether it's faster for you, 
you need a benchmark that simulates roughly what you do with the machine 
(ie a system-level benchmark).
