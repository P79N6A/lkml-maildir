it matters not that the MIPS R3K is 32-bits or not.  consider:
1) the lowly 8-bit motorola 6502 is capable of 64 bit math by chaining
   eight 8-bit operations.
2) even when CPUs are 64-bit, e.g., dec/compaq-alpha, time_t is still
   often 32-bits.
people do and will continue to do stuff like
  time_t tx;
  ...
  time(&tx);
  write(tx,sizeof(time_t),fd);
and this gets embedded into fileformats like tar and various databases
making it very hard to change.
just like y2k, it's not a question of cpu, but of data and file formats.
since the binary time format is so pervasive, i predict it will be
harder to fix than the y2k problem.  in y2k it was mostly I/O format
strings and BCD dates in COBOL datastructures.  2038 will be all of
unix.
