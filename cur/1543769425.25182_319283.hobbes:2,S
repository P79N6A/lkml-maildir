Do you have a test case that would show this up?  I've been testing a 
centos-4 based server with the RH-derived 2.6.9-based kernel tweaked to 
disable 4K stacks and enable XFS and haven't run into any issues yet.  
This includes running the parallel IOR benchmark from 10 clients (and 
getting 200MiB/s throughput on reads).
