I'. not sure what NIC the original poster meant, but:
PRO 100 is actually an older card than e100 supports. e100 supports Pro
100+ and other newer cards. Original Pro 100 used 82556 but this doc
(and e100) is about 82557 and newer chips.
The PCI ID of 82556-based pro 100 smart was just removed from eepro100
driver too because it didn't actually work. I have two of these cards
and tested myself that they did not work.
