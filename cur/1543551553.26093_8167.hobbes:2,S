ok. first this is what df -i gives me
Filesystem            Inodes   IUsed   IFree IUse% Mounted on
/dev/hda4            1822720  135002 1687718    8% /
so it's not the inode problem.
this is what  tune2fs -l /dev/hda4 | grep ^Reserved gives me
tune2fs 1.19, 13-Jul-2000 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
Reserved block count:     364266
Reserved blocks uid:      0 (user root)
Reserved blocks gid:      0 (group root)
I'm not sure what to make of the tune2fs output but from what df -i and df
-m shows me, i'm not out of space or inodes.  And as for someone else
getting this error with open-office, i suspect that somehow, this is on the
cvs server side and has nothing to do with my system, unless it's a cvs
version incompatibility.
