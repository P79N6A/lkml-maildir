I have looked into NUT source and it seems that this error message is 
output after interaction with libusb, not hiddev. It looks like libusb's 
usb_claim_interface() or usb_control_msg() in in 2.6.22-rc3 is failing 
with -EPERM.
So I am adding USB devel mailinglist into CC and leaving the original 
message below for reference.
