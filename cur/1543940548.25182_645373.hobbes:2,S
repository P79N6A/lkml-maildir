I asked this before and I don't remember getting an answer:
How does this deal with certain special cases:
- chroot: how will mount/df only show the for chroot relevant mounts?
- loop: how is the connection between file and loop device maintained?
I don't quite see how you want to achieve a _full_ replacement.
Could also please explain why you want to go via user mounts. Other OS use a 
daemon for that, which e.g. can maintain access controls. How do you want to 
manage this?
bye, Roman
