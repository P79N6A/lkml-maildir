That does improve matters immensely, and the system does actually boot
far enough for me to get a login prompt.
However, a few seconds after I logged in, I received:
>n  4 23:12:07 erwin kernel: SCSI error : <0 0 6 0> return code = 0x70000
Jan  4 23:12:07 erwin kernel: end_request: I/O error, dev sdb, sector 4973144
Jan  4 23:12:07 erwin kernel: Buffer I/O error on device dm-1, logical block 237
663
Jan  4 23:12:07 erwin kernel: lost page write due to I/O error on dm-1
then after it repeated about 30 times...
Jan  4 23:12:07 erwin kernel: SCSI error : <0 0 6 0> return code = 0x70000
Jan  4 23:12:07 erwin kernel: end_request: I/O error, dev sdb, sector 4980224

434
Jan  4 23:12:07 erwin kernel: lost page write due to I/O error on dm-1
which also repeated many times.
While this did not appear to cause any actual data loss, I was spooked
enough that I rebooted the machine into 2.4.23 immediately.  I do not
believe that this is any sort of physical disk problem.
