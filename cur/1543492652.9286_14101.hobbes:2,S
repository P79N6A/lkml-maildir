How does the current version perform (0.5.2)? On my setup, reading is
back up to scratch (yes, it did dip a while) and write performance is
slightly better.

Yes. We currently cluster writes in blocks of wsize and then shove
them out in one fell write, however we do not do this for reading. The
reason is that we already have the file readahead feature, so the gain
would not be as great. The clustering would, however, be easy to adapt
to provide read clustering, so if it turns out useful, I could extend
it.

NB: The current 'ac' release is against 2.2.5-ac6. I've just seen ac7
on ftp.no.kernel.org, but I can't be bothered to update that just this
minute. I assume Alan hasn't changed much to the NFS stuff, so it will
probably patch cleanly.
    Oh: and don't forget to update 'mount' as well. My previous release
had some bugs. My humble thanks to those who helped me out with patches...
