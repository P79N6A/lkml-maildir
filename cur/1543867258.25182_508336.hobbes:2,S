OK, that does seem kind of ugly.

Yup, if we just set the "size" of the node to zero, it seems
like a natural degenerate case that should be handled anyway.

Just seems kind of ugly and unnecessary, particularly if that
memory-less cpu (or IO node) is equidistant from one or more
memory-possessing nodes. As long as their zonelist is set up
correctly, it should all work fine without that, right?
build_zonelists_node already checks populated_zone() so it looks
like it's all set up for that already ...
