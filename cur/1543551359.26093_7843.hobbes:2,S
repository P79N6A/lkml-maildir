The memory map of a user process on x86 looks like this:
-------------
    KERNEL (always present here)
0xC0000000
-------------
0xBFFFFFFF
    STACK
-------------
    MAPPED FILES (incl. shared libs)
0x40000000
-------------
    HEAP (brk()/malloc())
    EXECUTABLE CODE
0x08048000
-------------
Try examining /proc/*/maps, and also watch your programs call brk() using
strace; you'll see all this in action...

I don't know; anyone care to comment?

In hardware, with the TLB and, if the TLB misses, then page tables.

Only when an attempt is made to access an unmapped or protected page; then
you get an interrupt (page fault), which the kernel code handles.

Not even the kernel accesses physical memory directly. It can, however,
choose to map the physical memory into its own address space contiguously.
Linux puts it at 0xC0000000 and up. (question for the gurus- what happens on
machines with >1GB of RAM?)

Linux does not swap kernel memory; the kernel is so small it's not worth the
trouble (are there other reasons?). e.g. My Linux boxes run 1-2MB of kernel
code; my NT machine is running >6MB at the moment...
