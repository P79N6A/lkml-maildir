In this case, it is.  He ignored all feedback and bug reports about his
design, which was not shared at all with linux-kernel.
I had to come up with my own PCI probe interface before he pipes up and
says "I've done that already."  Donald has consistently failed to work
with other kernel developers.

This is completely divorced from reality.
Donald produced a design, then ignored my feedback, Alan Cox's feedback,
etc.
His design was dumped because it DIDN'T WORK.  Simple as that.
Further, Martin Mares' PCI interface is NOT a quick hack, is a superset
of the functionality available in Donald's interface, and (a) it works,
(b) it's clean, and (c) it has been developed and discussed in public,
with feedback from other kernel developers.
