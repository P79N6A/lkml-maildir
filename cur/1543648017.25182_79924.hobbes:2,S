PS/2 mouse.
X won't start without mouse specified.
Disabling Load "glx" and making sure gpm wasn't running it switched to X
with the keyboard still functional, but not reliably. Sometimes it worked,
sometimes it didn't.
Having gpm loaded, it never worked - keyboard and mouse dead.
Having Load "glx" in /etc/X11/XF86Config-4, it never worked.
2.4.x works fine in X
One thing I just noticed - gpm doesn't supply a mouse pointer in console 
in 2.5.x. It does in 2.4.x.
