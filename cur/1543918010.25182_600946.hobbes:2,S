Please quantify loooong.

I'm still not sure that we fully understand this yet.
If the sdb writer is stuck in balance_dirty_pages() then all sda writers
will be in balance_dirty_pages() too, madly writing stuff out to sda.  And
pdflush will be writing out sda as well.  All this writeout to sda should
release the sdb writer.
Why isn't this happening?

Well that has a nice safetly net.  Perhaps it could fail a bit later on,
but that depends on why it's failing.
How well tested was this?
If we merge this for 2.6.23 then I expect that we'll immediately unmerge it
for 2.6.24 because Peter's stuff fixes this problem by other means.
Do we all agree with the above sentence?
