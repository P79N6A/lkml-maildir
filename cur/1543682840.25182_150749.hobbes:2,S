Without more specific guidance, dbench looks like a load of crap.
"dbench 50" is claiming 850MB/s throughput on a system with 1 disk @
u320 and 2 disks on a seperate 40 MB/s (Ultra Wide SE SCSI). More details 
are appended below.  I'll try again with lmbench or bonnie.
Andi, if you could pass me details about the "reaim new dbase" (ie how
many devices I need, where to get it) I could make time to try that in
the next couple of weeks.

yes - James Bottomley was asking for the same info.
