Sorry, but this is bullshit (like most of the lsm changes).  Either you
leave the capable in and say it's enough or you add your random hook
and remove that one.  Just adding more and more hooks without thinking
gets us exactly nowhere except to an unmaintainable codebase.
Also is there a _real_ need to pass in all the arguments?

Umm, you can't tell me you deny someone to initialize a module he has
just created?

You don't think this should maybe be just one hook?

Dito.

Aha.  So every LS module knows about every single sysctl in the
kernel.  Common, this is silly guys (and girls if there any)!

You might be allowed to swapon but not swapoff?

What's the point of cmd here?  Someone might be allowed to halt the
system but not reboot?

Live would be a lot simple if an unimplemented op would behave
as returning zero..
