We are pleased to announce the 2.6.24.7-rt26 and 2.6.26.8-rt13 trees,
which can be downloaded from the location:
  
http://rt.et.redhat.com/download/
Information on the RT patch can be found at:

Changes since 2.6.26.6-rt12
  - Removed sched-prioritize-non-migrating-rt-tasks.patch that
    caused a bug in the scheduler.
   (Thanks to Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo for reporting the bug,
    and Gregory Haskins for finding the patch that caused it
    after I explained to him the problem)
Changes in both 2.6.24.7-rt26 and 2.6.26.8-rt13  (all by Thomas Gleixner)
  - trace-histogram: handle clock going backwards
  - interrupt enabled in irq fix
to build a 2.6.24.7-rt26 tree, the following patches should be applied:

And like always, my RT version of Matt Mackall's ketchup will get this
for you nicely:

The broken out patches are also available.
The git tree can now be compiled, we are now working on getting it to
boot ;-)  It is based off of the v2.6.28 tag.
