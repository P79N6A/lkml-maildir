But that's exactly what Brian's later patch does!  Did you actually
read the patch?  All that we are doing is testing one bit in the
struct pci_dev to see whether to do the actual access or not.  Or do
you want one bit to tell us whether to go and look at another bit to
see whether to do the access? :)

How would you use a quirk to block config space accesses?  The two are
unrelated.

Well, I can see that that would limit your power management options,
but fortunately we don't have SMM on the machines where we need this
config access blocking.

There is no extra locking introduced by Brian's patch.  Config
accesses were already taking the pci_lock and that hasn't changed.

Perhaps you could expand on what you mean by "do the job well"?
