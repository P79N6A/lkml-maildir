Linus, things still fail for me even with the $(strip ...) construct
you added works properly.
For some reason things like $(call cc-option-yn...) still fail.
My make version 3.81beta4 has the space problem, and with your
change it just returns a space. :-)  Without your change it
gives the problematic " y" string.
A running theory of mine is that it's a "$(call)" within a
$(call) which generates the space.  So I wrote a little
make.test:
define test1
  $(shell echo "str1")
endef
define test2
  $(call test1)
endef
FOO := A$(call test2)B
all:
	echo A$(FOO)B
If I run "make -f make.test" I get:
davem@sunset:~/src/GIT/net-2.6$ make -f make.test
echo AA    str1BB
AA str1BB
davem@sunset:~/src/GIT/net-2.6$
Hmmm...  but I just checked on a proper "GNU Make 3.81" and that
prints the space in the example above too.
Weird...
