wait a sec, what about starvation issues ? if the semaphore is used for
resource counting then it's ok. but if it is used as a mutex then we're
in trouble. LIFO is unacceptable, FIFO might have priority inversion.
calculating goodness() on all the processes in the waitqueue and picking
the winner sounds like the way to go, IMHO.
