As far as I understand the PCI specs, your device is currently NOT a PCI
device.
Support for shared IRQs on PCI is as far as I can tell not optional.
Short of designing your own mainboard there is no way to prevent the
interrupt lines from being joined.  One one board I use there are 6 PCI
devices, with 3 on INT-A and 3 on INT-B (The SBC doesn't have INT-C and
INT-D).  On my desktop machine, INT A is the same on slot 1 and 5, 2,
and 6 and onyl 3 and 4 have INT-A to themselves.  Of course this doesn't
prevent the bios from assigning the same IRQ to INT-A on multiple sets
as well.  I have run a PPro some years ago with a single IRQ shared
among all the PCI devices in the system.  Neither linux nor windows had
a problem with that and neither did any of the many PCI devices.
I think you are stuck waiting for the hardware guys to give you a PCI
device that is really a PCI device.  If you are lucky you can find one
slot in your machine that doesn't share INT-A with any other PCI device,
although on most modern machines there are so many PCI devices that it
is imposible to find one that isn't shared.
