kbuild-2.5-common-2.4.19-pre8-1.bz2, kbuild-2.5-i386-2.4.19-pre8-1.bz2
are available.  Use with core-14.
I built these from common-2.4.18-7, i386-2.4.18-2 plus some previous
work on 2.4.19-pre6 then updated to -pre8.  A cross check against Tom
Duffy's 19-pre8 patch found errors in my patches and Tom's, which have
been reconciled.
