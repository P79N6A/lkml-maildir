   These are not obscure cookies, but real physical addresses.

   Sure. I was talking about this as a right solution for 2.2. In 2.3, we finally
need to make kernel understand there can be multiple buses, each of them using
either a different phys<->bus mapping or an IOMMU. I started working on a new
set of I/O functions, but for now I have to do some exams first.
				Have a nice fortnight
