Because I was thinking that the expected behaviour was the one
implemented before 2.6.12. So I really thought to fix a bug, again
sorry for not having checked the history...
That said, it's really confusing to pass a virtual address as an
offset because:
    (a) mmap() has always worked with offset not addresses;
    (b) the kernel will treat this virtual address as an offset
        until kmem driver convert it back to a virtual
        address. And it seems that during this convertion the
        lowest bits of the virtual address will be lost...
Maybe read/write behaviours should be changed to use the offset as an
offset and not as a virtual address.

yes, see above.

yes we can if the desired behaviour is the one introduced by 2.6.12.

I don't get your point here. Do you mean that virt_to_phys() is only
meant for drivers ? If so, I would have said that virt_to_phys() is
prefered once boot memory init is finished...
