I *think* that's harmless in that version of the code, though I'm not
sure.
Trond's made a bunch of lockd fixes since then (e.g. 09c7938c), which
probably fix it.
And that printk has been changed to a BUG(), so it better not be
triggered any more....  I certainly don't see how it could happen in the
current code.
