this is the latest version of the generic mutex subsystem, against 
Linus-curr. The GIT tree can be pulled from:
  master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mingo/mutex-2.6.git/
or:
  rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mingo/mutex-2.6.git/
(once master has resynced)
or the patch-queue can be downloaded from:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/generic-mutex-subsystem/
this code is identical to the mutex code in 2.6.15-mm2. There's been 
little changes since -V15:
 - added the extra smp_mb()s to the generic headers, pointed out by 
   Linus.
 - finished the i_mutex conversion.
 - fixed the ALSA i_mutex related bug that the mutex debugging code 
   uncovered in -mm2 (part of the i_mutex conversion patch).
 - dropped the small-misc-conversions patch, will go through 
   maintainers, if the mutex core is upstream.
