While I like this patch a lot, there is one tiny bug I spotted, and one 
question:

should this be del_timer_sync()?

Even though this line of code existed in the driver prior to your patch, 
  this highlights a bug:  SA_SHIRQ should really only be passed to 
request_irq() when the device is a PCI device.  If it's an EISA device, 
that really shouldn't be present.
I am also curious why SA_INTERRUPT is needed.  EISA requirement?
This patch gets my ACK otherwise...  I'm glad somebody did this.
