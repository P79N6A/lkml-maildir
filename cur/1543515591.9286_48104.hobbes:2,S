the problem itself is the nontrivial one. You are trying to take a
spinlock-protected 'snapshot' of an indefinit-length kernel-space object,
and that is a nontrivial concept. The 'easy' solution is to give up
atomicity.

do you really need atomicity of the list? There are many places in the
kernel which have a spinlock-protected loop, and once they have the
potential to sleep they drop the lock and restart the loop.
truncate_inode_pages() is one example.
