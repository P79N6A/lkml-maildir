When media is not ready, command TEST_UNIT_READY fails with ahci irq
status == 0x40000001(IRQ_TF_ERROR) and serror == SERR_INTERNEL, then
ahci error handler calls atapi_eh_request_sense() and sets
ATA_QCFLAG_SENSE_VALID. Command REQUEST_SENSE executes successfully
and atapi_qc_complete() sets result = SAM_STAT_CHECK_CONDITION, and
now the whole TEST_UNIT_READY request is done and returns .

Yes, I saw this too :) and I am contacting the hardware engineers to
check if there is any hardware bug.
But, even though this were a hardware bug and could be fixed, we would
still need this patch since many SB600 boards have already come into
the market and those ASICs can never be fixed :(
So, if no errors in this patch, could Jeff please apply it ASAP?

I never see such an ID, and plan to remove 0x4381.
The patch which added the PCI IDs was not sent out by myself. I
checked all SB600 boards, and not found any 0x4381 controller, only
0x4380 instead. In fact, SB600 RAID and Non-RAID share the same PCI
device ID, only with class code different.

I just read your patch. Another difference is that my patch ignores
SERR_INTERNAL only when the command is ATAPI and IRQ_TF_ERR occurs. In
other cases, I think, we'd better not ignore the SERR_INTERNEL. Right?
The following is some detail:
// your patch:
+	if (ap->flags & AHCI_FLAG_IGN_SERR_INTERNAL)
+		serr &= ~SERR_INTERNAL;
// mine:
-       if (irq_stat & PORT_IRQ_TF_ERR)
+       if (irq_stat & PORT_IRQ_TF_ERR) {
               err_mask |= AC_ERR_DEV;
+
+               /* some controllers set INTERNAL ERROR on ATAPI
IRQ_TF_ERROR, ignore it */
+               if ((serror & SERR_INTERNAL) &&
+                    (ap->flags & AHCI_FLAG_TF_ERR_FIX) &&
+                     qc && qc->dev->class == ATA_DEV_ATAPI) {
+                       serror &= ~SERR_INTERNAL;
+               }
+       }
Tejun, you do me a great favor, thank you so much! for your previous
help, too :)
