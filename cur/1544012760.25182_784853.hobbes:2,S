Oh dear. The first victim of this driver... :(
As we can see below the mouse gets detected as an Elantech touchpad. This
means that it reacts to the Elantech magic knock with the exact same
response we expect from a real Elantech touchpad.
I see no way to prevent this from happening.

However, all version query results I have seen from Elantech touchpads have
a non-zero first byte and a zero second byte. So we could test for that to
prevent this mouse from being detected as a touchpad.
Dmitry, do you think something like this is sufficient?
