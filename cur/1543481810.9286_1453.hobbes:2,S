Oops. I see you posted separately to me and linux-kernel. I'm
forwarding my reply for the benefit of kernel readers.

Ah, I had overlook that. Thanks for pointing that out. That whole line

No, you provided a patch against stock linux-2.2.0-pre9 (as you
said). What it easier for me is a patch against stock
linux-2.2.0pre9+devfs-patch-v86.

The code is more subtle than I first thought. Upon further
examination, I see that your patch will break mounting devices which
do not register themselves with register_blkdev() when the
"devfs=only" boot option is passed. For example, the SCSI disc driver
calls devfs_register_blkdev() which is a no-op when "devfs=only".
I have come up with a different fix which I think is correct. I've
appended a fresh patch against stock 2.2.0-pre9. Please try this and
let me know how it goes.

This is intentional. Permission changes are
filesystem-specific. Imagine you have a chroot() gaol and you want to
change some permissions there but you don't want to affect any other
mounted devfs'. The current behaviour supports this.
When you unmount a devfs, you lose all the permissions that were
cached. The current way to fix this is to manaully change the
permissions when you mount a devfs.
In the long term, devfs will peek through to the underlying disc-based
filesystem and use the permissions specified there. If you change
permissions in devfs, the changes will be written back to the
underlying disc-based filesystem.
