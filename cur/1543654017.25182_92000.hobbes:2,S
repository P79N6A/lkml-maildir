Dear diary, on Sat, Nov 23, 2002 at 04:17:08PM CET, I got a letter,
where GertJan Spoelman <kl@gjs.cc> told me, that...
> Hello Petr,
Hello,
> Nice work.
> Can you add/change the comments for the mem and mem=exactmap parameters.
> The mem parameter doesn't behave in the same manner as it did before 
> 2.4.19/20, I think it changed somewhere in the 2.4.19-pre series.
> On an old Compaq 2500 with 320Mb memory the following line used to work :
> 	append="mem=320M"
> now I have to use:
> 	append="mem=exactmap mem=640K@0 mem=319M@1M"
> to get the kernel to see all the memory.
> On later kernels if I use mem=320M it only sees 16Mb, this is also true for 
> 2.5.44 (probably true for all the 2.5.x kernels) which I tried on that box.
> I don't know if it's only something specific for that box and maybe not 
> necessarily true for other systems which have to use the mem parameter.
> To me it looks like the mem parameter can now only be used to specify less 
> memory then the kernel actually recognizes.
Huh.. That could be some bug actually.. try to report this in a separate mail
with some attractive subject ;-).
> Also can you add how to use the mem=exactmap parameter, it says now that such 
> lines can be constructed based on BIOS output or other requirements, that 
> doesn't tell me how such a line should look like, I only found out how to use 
> it by searching through posts on lkml, maybe you can add the above append 
> lines as an example.
Thanks for the idea, done.
