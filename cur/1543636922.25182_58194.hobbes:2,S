UML has been updated to 2.5.27 and UML 2.4.18-42.  The changes since 
2.4.18-40 include:
	the terminal emulator that UML uses is now configurable
	fixed a race in 'jail' mode with threaded processes segfaulting
	various build fixes and code cleanups
Since UML didn't make 2.5.27, I'll be sending this patch in to Linus.
The patch is available at
	
http://uml-pub.ists.dartmouth.edu/uml/uml-patch-2.5.27-1.bz2
