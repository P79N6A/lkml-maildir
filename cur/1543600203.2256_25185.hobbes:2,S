I'm getting pretty sick and tired of these endless discussion. People
have been reporting problems and they are pretty much alway met with the
answer, "it works here, if you can do better send a patch".
Now for the past _9_ stable kernel releases, page aging hasn't worked
at all!! Nobody seems to even have bothered to check. I send in a patch
and you basically answer with "Ohh, but we know about that one. Just
apply patch wizzbangfoo#105 which basically does everything differently".
Yeah I'll have a look at that code, and I'll check what the page ages
look like when I actually run it (if it doesn't crash the system first).
