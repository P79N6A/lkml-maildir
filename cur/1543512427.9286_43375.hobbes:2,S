Yes, it should cause oops?

I never did that, I'll never do that, I only notice that the current
code is filled with races.

lock_kernel() is dropped on thread switch, the semaphore is not dropped.

AFAIK the problem is OOM:
* a process accesses a not-present, ie page fault:
...
handle_mm_fault(): this process own mm->mmap_sem.
->handle_pte_fault().
-> (eg.) do_wp_page().
-> get_free_page().
now get_free_page() notices that there is no free memory.
--> wakeup kswapd.
* the swapper runs, and it tries to swap out data from that process.
mm->mmap_sem is already acquired --> lock-up.
