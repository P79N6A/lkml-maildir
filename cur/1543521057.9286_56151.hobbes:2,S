Lines .36-.37 diff / lines 6023-6024:
-               pci_read_config_word(pdev, PCI_SUBSYSTEM_VENDOR_ID,
&svid);
-               pci_read_config_word(pdev, PCI_SUBSYSTEM_ID, &sid);
+               svid = dev->subsystem_vendor;
+               sid = dev->subsystem_device;
Is this just a case of pdev being typo'd as dev or something more complex?
I mean does the file need other changes (besides dev->pdev) to be actually usable?
