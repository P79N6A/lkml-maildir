Hi folks:
	I used to run some dual PPro boxes and they'd served me well.
Now I decide to "upgrade" to a pair of PII333's on a Tyan Thunder II
(S1696, the monster-dual-CPU-with-sound-and-with-SCSI board).  This
move has been nothing but trouble since.  First, the dual on-board UW
SCSI refused to work.  [I am now using my original AHA-2940 adapter.]
Then after I disabled it, I cannot install from CD-ROM-- every time it
hangs when the RH 5.1 installer reaches the SCSI-scanning stage.  NOW
I get random garbage spewed to the printer some time after each reboot
of the machine.  I realise that this may just be a toasted board, but
can someone tell me if there is something that I can try other than a
BIOS update, which I already did?
	Details of box: Dual PII/333, 256MB of ECC SDRAM DIMM's, RHL
4.2, kernel version 2.2.1 (the problem does not seem to happen with
kerne; 2.1.129, the reason why I posted to the kernel list); AHA2940
with two 4G UW-SCSI drives, a plextor CD-ROM, a panasonic CD-R, and a
640MB SCSI MO drive.  I am also using a logitech trackball, but not
the PS/2 kind.  Printing from another machine, with the same cables,
seem to do fine.
