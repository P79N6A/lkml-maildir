Can you please just shelve this crap? You have a way of knowing that "ALSA 
will accept you" and that is knowing or assuming that the ALSA project 
doesn't consist of drooling retards.
When a project list goes to the difficulty of moderating non-subscribers it 
has made the explicit choice to _not_ become subscriber only. Then refusing 
valid non-subscribers after all makes no sense whatsoever. I'm sorry you got 
your feelings hurt by that other list but it was no doubt an accident; take 
it up with them.
Rene.
