Note that this "memory" is RAM+swap.  So you can avoid allocation
failure by giving your strict overcommit box much more swap space.
The allocations will be backed by swap, this won't slow the machine
down at all because it isn't used normally.  Or to put it another
way - you'll use that extra swap only in those situations where
you otherwise get allocation failure or OOM killing.
