When acting as an ordinary user, the .config is beyond my control 
(except on Gentoo).   It is in control of the distro (Fedora, Ubuntu, 
... but perhaps not Gentoo).  I think the distro guys want a default 
behavior that is set in .config, with quirk overrides being done when 
needed.   And of course the user in his/her boot params gets the final say.
