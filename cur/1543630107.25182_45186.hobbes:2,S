You need to run mrouted, pimd (sparse or dense) or something like on the 
router.  Can't you just restart the daemon when the PPP interface switches 
state?
An alternative mechanisms would be:
 - using bridging (not applicable in this scenario)
 - doing IGMP proxying and other tricks on the router (haven't been 
implemented at least in Linux AFAIK).
