Got this on a random `cdcd eject`:
hdc: packet command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdc: packet command error: error=0x40
ATAPI device hdc:
  Error: Hardware error -- (Sense key=0x04)
  (vendor-specific error) -- (asc=0xb6, ascq=0x00)
  The failed "Start Stop Unit" packet command was: 
  "1b 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 "
Basically, it tried to eject, and got stuck after about a cm. Afterwards, it
was non-repeatable. The message seems to say hardware error, but I've never
had this happen before, and there wasn't anything blocking the tray <shrug>. I
also noticed these sort of activities generate messages like:
VFS: Disk change detected on device ide1(22,0)
in dmesg. Is this appropriate for a stable kernel like 2.2.x?
Regards,
m.
