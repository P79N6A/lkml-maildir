Ok.  Thanks.  If I stay sufficient stuck in irq land I will.  I keep
hoping to find the end of this project :)  This all started when I
looked at some problem with irqs and say hey that is easy to fix
you just do this....

Sure, it looks like I at least get to play care taker of this code for
a while.
I think the separation of linux irq numbers and hardware addresses
seems fairly sane.  Having something you can get a grip on is nice but
that really doesn't work for things like msi's.  Unless we move to a
completely sparse architecture where the irq number is: 
((((domain*256)+bus)*256)+devfn)*1024
As for supporting multiple irqs in plain MSI mode, I don't think
we want to do that.  The problem is that multiple interrupts
in msi mode cannot be individually routed.  I think we really want
to encourage vendors who are building cards with multiple MSI irqs
to use MSI-X.  MSI-X has a lot fewer ugly special cases and all
architectures can individually route the irqs.
If there are interesting cards that support just MSI mode and really
need more than one irq I would be happy to reconsider that decision
but my impression was that plain MSI was basically not quite flexible
enough to really be interesting, and supporting just one MSI irq was
ok but any more would lead to all kinds of strange special cases.
