It might be worth reverting some of the code back to the zlib original.
 The use of stack allocations here is actually a Linux divergence from
zlib (done by Linus), in order to reduce the number of dynamic allocations.
In general, the use of dynamic allocations is highly dangerous, because
any time you have dynamic allocations you have the choice of either
sleeping or failing, unless you have a pre-reserved memory pool.
