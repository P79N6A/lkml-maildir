Hi Yinghai,
Actually, Ingo got it right.  I had introduced the apicnum.h file to
get around header entanglements.  But as Ingo pointed out, I did the
include file chain wrong, so removing the apicnum.h file seemed to be
the correct thing to do.  (I just haven't figured out yet how to remove
a file via email patch.  I was just going to clean it up next time I
pushed changes to Ingo.)
Thanks,
Mike
