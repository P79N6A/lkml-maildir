Hi,
For my own enjoyment I've been playing around with 2.2.1 under _extremely_ low
memory conditions. (LILO: linux single mem=1718k)  The only kernel configuration
options selected are ELF , E2FS, and basic IDE support.  I do not even have
/proc selected.
One thing that I have noticed is that even after swapon -a has completed
successfully and there is plenty of swap  I get "Bus Errors" when executing
simple commands like vi.  Shouldn't these just be slow and not error out like
that?  I post this only in hopes that it might help someone track down a bug
occuring in a more common configuration than 1.7M ;-).  I don't seem to see
these in a 2M configuration.

P.S.  I'm happy to report that 2.2 seems to be the most efficient Linux kernel
yet.  It seems to scale down further that 2.0 and is even slightly smaller than
the "TinyLinux 0.5" kernel which is 1.2.11 based.  From 386SX/16-2MB with no HD
and 1 floppy to a 64 parallel processor 64bit Sparc with Gigabytes of RAM, The
scalability is certainly there.  Congratulations.
