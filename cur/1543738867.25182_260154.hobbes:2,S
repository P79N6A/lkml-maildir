Looks pleasantly simple, I'll have to try it!  I recall that Patrick's
patch also removed these comments ... methinks they're the
reason I wanted to avoid patching this myself, they make it sound
like there's a big deal.  Of course, (a) is one side of the bug so
it's got to go, but the other two were less obvious to me.   It
looked like (b) was undesirable prevention-of-concurrency,
but (c) might matter for the system-suspend cases.
