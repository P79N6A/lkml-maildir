Hello,
2.6.10-rc1 seems to have a tendency to lock up after about 8 hours or so
of uptime. Usually, I am in X, listening to music, and working on
something when this happens out of the blue. It's a hard hang and there is
no network response or ability to switch back to a tty so i can get
sysrq-t output. It just dies. This has happened twice in the past 48 or
so hours.
I can't really provide much debugging info though, due to the nature of
the hang. Is there anything that pops into mind that I should try to nail
this problem?
2.6.9 seems to be a lot better at staying alive.
Thanks
