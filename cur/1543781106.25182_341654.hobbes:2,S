Subject: [patch 39/39] remap_file_pages protection support: wrong "historical" code for review - 2

This "fast-path" was contained in the original
remap-file-pages-prot-2.6.4-rc1-mm1-A1.patch from Ingo Molnar; I think this
code is wrong, but I'm sending it for review anyway, because I'm unsure (and
in fact, in the end I found the reason for this).
I guess this code is intended for when we're called by sys_remap_file_page,
without altering pgoffset or protections (otherwise we'd refuse operation on a
private mapping). This cannot happen with mmap(MAP_POPULATE) because we clear
old mappings. And the code makes sense only if we COW'ed a page, because
otherwise the old mapping is already correct. I'm not sure whether we should
fail here - maybe skipping the PTE would be more appropriate. Or we could
anyway turn the nonblock param into a bitmask and pass O_TRUNC there.
However, this is wrong because both routines can be called from within
do_file_page, which is called when !pte_present(pte) && !pte_none(pte) &&
pte_file(pte). I.e.  the pte is not zeroed, so it has been used, but the page
has been swapped out, or the page hasn't been loaded in first place (for
instance for MAP_NONBLOCK).
More accurately, in that situation ->populate is called with nonblock == 0, so
only install_page can be called there. If ->populate fails, the faulting
process will get an inappropriate SIGBUS.
