Ok, well, the Intel compiler actually ends up emulating GCC and  
supports most of its extensions; supposedly it can even be used to  
compile the kernel sources, as per include/linux/compiler-intel.h. (I  
don't know how recently this has been tested, though)  So does  
anybody compile userspace under anything other than GCC or Intel  
compilers?  Do any such compilers even exist?
Cheers,
