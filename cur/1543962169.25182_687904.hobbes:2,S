Perhaps if they introduced fewer bugs, all of that would be less frustrating to
people who get hit by them, especially by two or more at a time.  Everyone
seems to be fine with that until it happens to him personally (like it happened
to David).

I obviously agree with that.  The question is, however, if we can decrease the
number of bugs introduced during merge windows and you seem to be saying
that no, we can't.  Which is disappointing.

I have never said you shouldn't take new code at all.  That's not what I'm
saying and please don't paint me this way.
I see a problem in that you get patches that you shouldn't have got because
they are unfinished and not well thought through.  They introduce regressions
which are only possible to find using bisection because of the amount of code
merged at a time and that's frustrating.
You seem to be regarding this as a necessity, but I'm really not convinced
that you're right in that.

However, the width of the merge window is not a predetermined thing and might
be adjusted, for example.  Other things might be changed too.

But that need not include obviously broken patches.

The problem is the (relatively small) fraction of patches pushed to you that
is broken.  Some patches are obviously broken, some of them are just not
tested well enough.  The result is pretty much the same in either case.
Now, the question is if we can get rid of that fraction by adjusting the
process somehow.  You're arguing that we can't and so be it.  [This is your
opinion and BTW there's nothing allowing me to call that unreasonable or saying
that you use made up arguments or something like this.]
My opinion is that we could at least try to do something about it.  linux-next
is probably a step in the right direction, though time will tell.  I'm afraid,
though, that I personally can't do much more than I've been doing already to
improve things.

The message that started this whole thread was not from me and I believe
it was sent for a reason.  So the fact is that at least some people lose their
patience over the current handling of merge windows.  And I'm not sure that's
necessary.
Thanks,
