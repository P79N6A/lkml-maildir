Not for individual data items, no. It would be completely useless because 
only the same CPUs are sharing data there.

Flooding the kmsg is as bad.
I think a better strategy is to just increase the minimum check interval
to avoid this. And then treat printk and mce_log the same.

Ok then perhaps a extremly long check timeout of 5 minutes?
