Why discard BM history here? This way the next bm check almost always
return 0.
BTW, bm activity is global (Not cpu specific), we'd better account it
system wide.

See the system state: idle->running->idle
Looks the bm_elapsed_us and break_elapsed_us account ingored the running
state between the two idles. Eg, the 'running' might generate a lot of
bm activity, then maybe we should reset bm_elapsed_us in the next
'idle'.
