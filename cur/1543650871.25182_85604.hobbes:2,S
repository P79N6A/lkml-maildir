I believe that netfilter is not appropriate here.
If it is protocol requirement, do it in the stack itself.
Well, HA is router. 
Sending side: Make mip6_forward().
              When new MN is being registered, setup proxy ndisc and 
              make routes to MN via mip device (which is mip tunnel),
              which actually calls mip6_foward().
              When packet arrives, it checks MNs and forward it to it.
Receiving side: 
              mipl tunnel receives packets from MN.
              check source address according to the list of MNs,
	      then forward it.
Also, I believe that the binding information should be hold as FIB entry.
