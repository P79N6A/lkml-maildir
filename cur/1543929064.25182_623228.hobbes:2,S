Not sure what you mean by operationally transparent?  It would be transparent 
for the updating client,  and the rest of the git-users would need to wait 
for the commit from the updating client; which is ok, as this transparency 
is not meant to change the server-side git-update semantic.

Judging an idea, based on a flawed implementation, doesn't prove that the 
idea itself is flawed.

You could probably do that, or you could instead use cp -al.  Both would 
require some hacks to allow some basic version control.

Sure, you wouldn't want to change the git-engine update semantics, as that 
sits on the server and handles all users.  But what the git model is 
currently missing is a client manager.  Right now, this is being worked 
around by replicating the git tree on the client, which still doesn't 
provide the required transparency.
IOW, git currently only implements the server-side use-case, but fails to 
deliver on the client-side.  By introducing a git-client manager that 
handles the transparency needs of a single user, it should be possible to 
clearly isolate update semantics for both the client and the server, each 
handling their specific use-case.
Thanks!
