Subject: [PATCH 7/9] USB usbfs: destroy submitted urbs only on the disconnected interface
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/4/14/72

The remaining three patches contain miscellaneous fixes to usbfs.
This one fixes up the disconnect callback to only shoot down urbs
on the disconnected interface, and not on all interfaces.  It also adds
a sanity check (this check is pointless because the interface could
never have been claimed in the first place if it failed, but I feel better
having it there).
