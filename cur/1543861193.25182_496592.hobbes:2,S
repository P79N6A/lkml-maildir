Samefile with keeping fds open doesn't buy you much anyway. What exactly
would be the value of a directory tree seen by operating only on fds
(even for directories) when some rogue process is renaming, moving,
updating stuff underneath?  One ends up with a tree which misses alot
of files and hardly bears any resemblance with the actual tree at any
point in time and I'm not even talking about filedata.
It is futile to try to get a consistent tree view on a live filesystem,
with- or without using fds. It just doesn't work without fundamental
support for some kind of "freezing" or time-travel inside the
kernel. Snapshots at the block device level are problematic too.

But then you're just _shifting_ the problem instead of fixing it:
st_ino/st_mtime (st_ctime?) are designed for this purpose. If the
filesystem doesn't support it properly: live with the consequences
which are mostly minor. Notable exceptions are of course backup tools
but backups _must_ be verified anyway so you'll discover soon.
(btw, that's what I noticed after restoring a system from a CD (iso9660
 with RR): all hardlinks were gone)
