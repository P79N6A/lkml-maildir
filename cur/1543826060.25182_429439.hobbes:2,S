ok. I forgot to mention that it's probably a good idea to first apply 
my lockdep-combo patch to -mm2:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/lockdep-patches/lockdep-combo-2.6.17-rc5-mm2.patch
this includes all current -mm hotfixes and all lockdep fixes. (The 
lockdep tracer patch will still apply cleanly ontop of the combo patch.)
