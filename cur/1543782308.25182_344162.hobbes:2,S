Some (not all!) of my m68k test builds are now failing with:
| linux-m68k-2.6.13-rc7/drivers/char/mem.c: In function `mmap_kmem':
| linux-m68k-2.6.13-rc7/drivers/char/mem.c:267: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size
| linux-m68k-2.6.13-rc7/drivers/char/mem.c:267: invalid operands to binary <<

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
