This patch merges the network changes from my 2.4 pool.
        the network drivers react better to errors
        there is now a slirp backend
        the code that's common to the slip and slirp backends is shared
        cleaned up device initialization
        applied a bunch of slip cleanups and fixes
I also merged the network-specific help into the config.
