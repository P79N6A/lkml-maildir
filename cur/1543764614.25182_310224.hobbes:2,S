the reordering of switch_to() and the switch_mm()-related logic was that 
made it really worthwile and clean. I.e. we pick a task atomically, we 
switch stacks, and then we switch the MM. Note that this setup still 
leaves the possibility open to move the stack-switching back under the 
irq-disabled section in a natural way.

it also removes extra stores to rq->prev_mm and other stores. I havent 
measured any degradation on x86.
If the irq disable/enable becomes widespread i'll do another patch to 
push the irq-enabling into switch_to() so the arch can do the 
stack-switch first and then enable interrupts and do the rest - but i 
didnt want to complicate things unnecessarily for now.

yeah, i thought about these two variants and went for set_task_on_cpu() 
so that it's less encapsulated (it's really just a conditional 
assignment) and that it parallels set_task_cpu() use. But no strong 
feelings either way. Anyway, lets try what we have now, i'll do the rest 
in deltas.
