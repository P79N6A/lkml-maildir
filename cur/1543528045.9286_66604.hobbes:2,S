   Alternatively, they can mount /devfs as /devfs and put a symlink
   in with /dev -> /devfs unless I'm mistaken?
No, because in this scenario this is someone who wants /dev to be a real
directory with real device inodes, and not use /devfs for their devices.
Hence, /dev has to be a real directory and not a symlink to /devfs.
However, if we start moving synthetic files from /proc to devfs, and
programs are accessing them via /dev/kitchensink, then we will need to
put lots of symlinks from /dev/* to /devfs.
