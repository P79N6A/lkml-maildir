That's fine if the 32-bit process wants to have O_LARGEFILE ... but not
all of them do ... some 32-bit binaries are compiled without O_LARGEFILE
support, and will be surprised to have it given to them.
This is particularly an issue on ia64, where 32-bit processes may be
emulated in s/w ... by a 64-bit process.
