Oh man.  When you think one implementation of a 'standard' is better then
multiple go to the MS world.

For me (and others) it is an issues.

With mconfig it can be implemented easily - I don't see the point in
doing it, though.

One toplevel config file can be implemented in CML1 easily,
using mconfig or the old and ugly tools, it's just a question of changeing
the rule base in tree.
At last Alan think multiple toplevel files are a feature, not a bug
(I don't agree with him on that) so it's a completly separate discussion.

Of course it doesn't work. We've performed a software upgrade.
