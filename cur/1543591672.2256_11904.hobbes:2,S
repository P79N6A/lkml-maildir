For speeding up a boot process, sure... but for suspend/resume on a
laptop --- why would you bother?
    Don't get _too_ hung up about the power-management kind of
    "invisible suspend/resume" sequence where you resume the whole
    kernel state.
I'm confused. I've always wondered that before you suspend the state
of a machine to disk, why we just don't throw away unnecessary data
like anything not actively referenced.
