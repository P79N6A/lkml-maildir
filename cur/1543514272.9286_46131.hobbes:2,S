Capabilities are needed too. I want to be able to isolate one group of
users from even inadvertent disclosure of files to anyone outside the group.
That calls for compartmentalization.
I want to be able to prevent any user from being able to modify system
files (even root), yet be able to allow any user to be able to use them.
That calls for a multi-level security (at a minimum "syshigh" for shadow
password files and some configuration/log files; "syslow" for the password
file and standard utilities; and 0 for all user processes and user files).
