Er, yes.  By design.
The kernel has to run an init program in order to hand off control to 
userspace.  In initramfs, this is defined as /init.  It looks in exactly one 
documented place.
The older root= mechanism fell back to a half-dozen places (eventually trying 
things like /bin/sh if it couldn't find anything else).  This is because 
there wasn't a documented standard for what should be executed, like there is 
with initramfs.

I don't use selinux.  I'm neither a Fortune 500 company nor the NSA.
However, if you don't trust your own initramfs, where everything starts out 
running as root, you have bigger problems.

I haven't tried it but it really doesn't sound like brain surgery.  If your 
switch_root is statically linked, you can use mv instead of cp.

*shrug*  I don't object to doing so, but I've heard nebulous technical 
objections from people who know more about the implementation details fo 
tmpfs than I do.

*scratches head*
That's a tautology, right?

I have no idea what you just said.  If there's an /init, we boot from it.  If 
there's no /init, they just violated the spec and we don't know what to boot 
from.
They made an initramfs.  They constructed it, explicitly, for the Linux 
kernel, and /init is what the kernel will try to boot.  I documented this 
years ago.  If they chose not to put an /init, then they didn't want us to 
boot from initramfs.  (Maybe they're supplying firmware and an /sbin/hotplug 
for a statically linked device.  I dunno.)

I've been using initramfs since back around 2.6.12.  It works fine.  Why are 
you patching the kernel for something that already works?
