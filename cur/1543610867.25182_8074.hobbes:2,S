Hi, I'm trying to create a module that will:
1) intercept System Calls to a Block Device (i.e. no direct communications 
between the Application and Block Device) and instead
2) Communicate directly with a Block Device without interference from other 
layers.
In other words, the module will effectively hide all direct communication 
between the application and block device.
Please advice.
Thanks
