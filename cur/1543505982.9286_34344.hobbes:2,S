The below one should be the patological case to show the performance hit
caused by the additional pte mapping and invlpg done in the page-fault
handler:
#define SIZE (700*1024*1024)
	int i;
	char * buf = malloc(SIZE);
	if (!buf)
		...
	i = 0;
	get_start_time();
	for (; i < SIZE; i += 4096, buf += 4096)
		*(int *) buf = 0;
	get_stop_time();
	printf("time %d\n", get_diff_time());
(The optimal thing would be to measure the time in CPU ticks with rdtsc.)
Then we should repeat the same thing doing a COW. So first allocing say
300mbyte of RAM with bzero, and then forking and then starting rewring to
the now read-only buffer in the child, to force lots of cow.
I just know that the performance hit of the shm case will be equal to the
one of the anonymous memory case.
The pseudocode is just almost C code, so maybe this time it's simpler to
add two rdtsc... (if you have some more hint you are welcome of course).

Nice ;), yes.
