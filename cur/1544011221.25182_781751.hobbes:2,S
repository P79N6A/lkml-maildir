I haven't said that they are the cause of this test case. I've said that
deferred requests hold references to the socket that can obviously
deadlock. That needs to be fixed regardless of whether or not it is the
cause here.
There are plenty of situations in which the client may choose to close
the TCP socket even if there are outstanding requests. One of the most
common is when the user signals the process, so that an RPC call that
was partially transmitted (ran out of buffer space) gets cancelled
before it can finish transmitting. In that case the client has no choice
but to disconnect and immediately reconnect.

AFAICS, deferred requests are the property of the cache until they
expire or a downcall occurs. I'm not aware of any way to cancel only
those deferred requests that hold a reference to this particular
transport.
