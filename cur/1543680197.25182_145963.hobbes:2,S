Dear Reader...
No More Accent is an accent reduction product, which helps to remove accents. For example, an Asian lady (or any nationality) may have communication problems with her English when speaking to her friends or business colleagues.
With that in mind, No More Accent teaches Accent Reduction methodologies to help in this area. In fact, No More Accent can be used in almost any situation where an accent reduction is required. Even Actors within the Entertainment Industry have turned to No More Accent as a way to lose or gain an accent of another nationality.
No More Accent is available in two versions, CD-ROM and VHS Cassette Tape (PAL and NTSC formats) both can be purchased directly
