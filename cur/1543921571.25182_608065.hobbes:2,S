Er...  That patch is on top of the current mainline, including
commit 2b8232ce512105e28453f301d1510de8363bccd1.  Check if what
you are applying it against the recent tree.  By the look of your
build log you are missing
-       $(Q)ln -fsn $(srctree)/include/asm-$(SUBARCH) include/asm-um/arch
+       $(Q)ln -fsn $(srctree)/include/asm-$(HEADER_ARCH) include/asm-um/arch
 else
-       $(Q)cd $(TOPDIR)/include/asm-um && ln -sf ../asm-$(SUBARCH) arch
+       $(Q)cd $(TOPDIR)/include/asm-um && ln -sf ../asm-$(HEADER_ARCH) arch
in arch/um/Makefile.
That, or you simply need to do make mrproper...
