Subject: [PATCH] Serial: MPSC - Set baudrate when BRG divider is set.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Mark A. Greer <mgreer@mvista.com>
The clock to generate the desired baudrate with the MPSC is first divided
by the Baud Rate Generator (BRG) and then by the MPSC itself.  So, when
the BRG divider is changed, the MPSC divider must also be changed to
generate the correct baudrate.  During MPSC initialization, the BRG
divider is changed but the MPSC divider isn't changed until much later.
This results in some printk's coming out garbled.  To fix that, set the
MPSC divider at the same time that the BRG divider is changed.
