I find that a lot of the time memtest does not reveal an error. Only
when you combine multiple sources or on random access do you get
errors. For example compiling a kernel while doing heavy I/O on the
disk. But that might just be me. Errors are rather random occurances.
Compiling a kernel repeadatly and multiple in parallel is usualy a
good test. If it sometimes fails to compile then it is near certain a
hardware error.
