Subject: [PATCH] Multipath routing algorithm determination
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/6/30/269

Hi,
This patch assigns the multipath routing algorithm into the fib_info
struct's fib_mp_alg variable. Previously, the algorithm was always set to
IP_MP_ALG_NONE which was incorrect. This patch corrects the problem by
assigning the correct value when a fib_info is initialized.
This patch was tested against kernel 2.6.12.1 for all multipath routing
algorithms (none, round robin, interface round robin, random, weighted
random).
Please look this patch over and apply it to the kernel. I have been unable 
to contact the creators of the multipath algorithm feature so this is why 
I sent it to the lkml.
I am not a member of the list so please cc me in the reply.
