Ok I've done one better than that ;) I had wli help make some 
instrumentation for me to help find the remaining non preemptible kernel 
portions and set the cutoff to 2ms. Here is what I found:
7ms non-preemptible critical section violated 2 ms preempt threshold 
starting at reiserfs_sync_fs+0x2d/0xc2 and ending at reiser
fs_lookup+0xe2/0x221
9ms non-preemptible critical section violated 2 ms preempt threshold 
starting at reiserfs_dirty_inode+0x37/0x10e and ending at r
eiserfs_dirty_inode+0xb0/0x10e
These seem to be the two offenders. Hope this helps.
