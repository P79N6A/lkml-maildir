Hi,
    Thanks a lot for the help.  Any particular reason to use the new driver
now or should I just wait until 2.4.15 is release?
    Guess I didn't need to do all that debugging.  Bug may have already been
caught.  8-)
    However I did notice something.  The patch you've included below covers
the cciss.c file?  My system is using the cpqarray driver.  And I fixed the
problem by replacing the cpqarray.[ch], ida_cmd.h, and ida_ioctl.h files.  I
don't think the patch below would have done anything for me as I'm pretty
sure the cciss.c file isn't used by the cpqarray driver and since I didn't
change out the cciss.c file in my now working kernel source tree (linux
2.4.14-lkd1 8-D).
