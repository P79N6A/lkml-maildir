Hi all,
sard-0.6 is being uploaded to
	ftp.uk.linux.org:/pub/linux/sct/fs/profiling/
Included are the sard disk profiling patches for Red Hat 2.2.16-3
kernels, plain 2.2.17pre12, and for 2.4.0test5pre1.
This patch also includes a modified version of atsar-1.5 (the Linux
"sar" clone) which understands the newer sard kernel output format.
There are no changes in functionality in this version, although the
2.4 patch has been cleaned up somewhat.
Cheers,
 Stephen
