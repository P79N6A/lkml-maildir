The LinuxThreads pthread_create works by passing a message through a pipe to a
manager thread, and then blocking. The manager thread allocates the resources
for the new thread and then creates it via clone(). It then unblocks the
original thread which is suspended inside pthread_create().
It's not all that light of a procedure, as you can see. If you need a fast
response time in assigning a thread to a task to be done, consider thread pool
techniques for reusing existing threads, and for limiting the number of active
threads.
