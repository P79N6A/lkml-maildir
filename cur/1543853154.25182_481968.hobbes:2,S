I think we're talking past each other but effectively in agreement. Bill
was suggesting that multiple controllers were out of scope for the
proposal, which is what I was objecting to. If the API is handling a GPIO
cookie and allows for multiple controllers, I have no objections.

I disagree. Pin muxing kicks in for pins that aren't GPIO-capable, but
for many cases GPIO-capable is just another pin state that can be handled
via muxing. Pin refcounting is obviously not within the scope of your
proposed API (nor should it be), but we do need to allow for pin muxing
to be reconfigured in the GPIO case if nothing else is using the pin in
question that the GPIO maps to. Most of this will be platform specific
and layered, though.

Your definition of "typical" seems to vary considerably from mine. The
typical case more and more is having multiple functions per pin, where a
GPIO state is just another function. If muxing happens within the board
setup code, then we've already effectively locked out the other
functions. This is also not something that can be resolved at build time.
For example, I happen to have a UART RX and an MMC DMA request on the
same pin (GPIO-configured for certain implementations). Both of these can
be provided as modules for a "production" board where the pin can then be
grabbed and toggled depending on which module is inserted, doing any sort
of pin setup on the board side will not help in this case, it's something
that needs to happen higher up.
