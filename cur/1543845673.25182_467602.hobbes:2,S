I am yet to reach that stage, most of my playing around was w.r.t moving tasks.
At this point my basic aim was to test basic stability and look at the
accounting w.r.t correctness. I am yet to run any stress on the system.

One possible solution is to move the container tracking out of the pages and
into address_space and anon_vma. I guess this functionality will complicate
task migration and accounting a bit though.

Aah, I see. Once possible minor concern here is that a task could hope across
several containers, it could map files in each container and allocate page
cache pages, when it reaches the limit, it could hop to another container
and carry on until it hits the limit there.

Yes, that would be nice.
