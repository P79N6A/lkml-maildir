Actually there is a larger issue too:
I would love it if someone (kernel janitors?) went through the kernel 
code and dug out all the comments like this.  "should be gone by 1.3" :) 
  "should be removed in 2.5".  etc.  This should be a pretty easy, but 
time consuming job that even newbies could sink their teeth into.
Then we can go through the list and kill the issues, or the comments.
