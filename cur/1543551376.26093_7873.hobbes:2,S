The 'sendmsg' error means you're trying to mount with NLM locking
enabled before having started the portmapper. That's a no-no: always
has been, and always will be. It 'worked' (not) in 2.2.x due to a
hack.
If you don't need locking, mount using the 'nolock' option. If you do,
make sure that your startup scripts fire up portmap and rpc.statd
before you mount your extra disks.
As for the necessary 'mount' changes; they have already gone into the
standard util-linux package. Just pick up the latest version from your
nearest mirror site, or from Andries' master site:

Cheers,
