I think that FUA was designed for a different use case than what Linux 
is using barriers for currently. The advantage with FUA is when you have 
"before barrier", "after barrier" and "don't care" sets, where only the 
specific things you care about ordering are in the before/after barrier 
sets. Then you can do this:
Issue all before barrier requests with FUA bit set
Wait for all those to complete
Issue all after barrier requests with FUA bit set
Wait for all those to complete
Meanwhile a bunch of "don't care" requests could be going through on the 
device in the background. If we could do this, then I think there would 
be an advantage. Right now, it just saves a command to the drive when 
we're flushing on the post-barrier writes.
This would only be efficient with NCQ FUA, because regular FUA forces 
the requests to complete serially, whereas in this case we don't really 
care what order the individual requests finish, we just care about the 
ordering of the pre vs. post barrier requests.

Aside from the issue above, as I mentioned elsewhere, lots of NCQ drives 
don't support non-NCQ FUA writes..
