Claus,
Looks like your bug.  As an FYI, sendmail.rpms in Suse, RedHat, and
OpenLinux all exhibit this behavior, which means they're all broken. 
Reading an entire file into memory must be a BSD feature.  I have
enabled an SSH account for you, so you can come in and debug.  Richard
also can get in and will be helping.
