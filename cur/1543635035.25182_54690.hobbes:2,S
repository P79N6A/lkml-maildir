It is puzzling indeed, especially since I am running with TCQ enabled ever 
since you introduced it and my disk is still alive an kicking. It being a 
Deathstar, too.
On of my Deathstars actually broke (before TCQ came about though!) but 
after upgrading the firmware on it and powercycling it fixed itself and has 
been working just fine ever since.
Perhaps something worth trying on those broken disks, too?
Best regards,
