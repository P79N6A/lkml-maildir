Ok Hi,
I sent an earlier email (
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0309.3/0409.html
 )
asking what kind of info dev's wanted for a report and where I could get it.
1. Where can I find the kernel log?
If it's in /var/log/kernel/ my current file hold's this
Sep 26 16:56:55 [kernel] Linux version 2.6.0-test5 (root@localhost) (gcc

Looks like nothing usb related to me.
2. I have a usb keyboard plugged in It's packard Bell model number 9201
3. This did not happen with 2.4
4. ACPI is for laptops correct? I'm using a desktop and I've never installed
anything ACPI related..
I'm sorry for a bad bug report It's just that it was my first :) Hope this
helps
