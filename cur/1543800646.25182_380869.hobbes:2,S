Is multiple-source mixing really a "high end" requirement? When I last 
checked, the OSS driver didn't support multiple applications claiming it at 
once, thus requiring you to use "more bloat" like esound, arts, or some other 
crap to access your soundcard more than once at any given time.
I think when you consider other modern sound architectures across many 
operating systems have supported this fundamentally basic feature for a long 
time, it's important to the majority of end users.

I can't agree with that.
