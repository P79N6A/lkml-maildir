I'm not suggesting making the network a stateful device. I'm suggesting
having a firewall. That should NOT be implemented on the end node. Apart
from anything else, the firewall shouldn't run any services: this is a bit
difficult on a server...
The network isn't broken. It works very nicely, TYVM. The firewall will
occasionally need reconfiguring (block out new types of attack, allow new
services, etc.) It's just much easier (and more secure) on a dedicated
firewall than running a load of filtering on every single server.
