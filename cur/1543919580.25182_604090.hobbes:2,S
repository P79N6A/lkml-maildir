Part of the problem is that there is no compelling default. The name of 
the cross-compiler can vary depending on the chosen executable prefix or 
the chosen target tuple.
Let's say I create new cross toolchains for both m68k and powerpc. I use 
the "m68k-linux-gnu" to follow the m68k default, but let's assume powerpc 
users prefer their default "powerpc-linux" so I follow that too. The 
result is that I now have gcc's -B option working (or not working) in 
suprising ways too.
Uniformity is more helpful downstream than a different arbitrary default 
for each architecture. Debian should patch their default into their kernel 
source packages if they've standardised on cross compiler prefixes.

But there is no problem with calling that (?). Rob's patch doesn't change 
this.
