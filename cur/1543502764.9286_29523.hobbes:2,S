What's the compression setup at your end?
I found that the ISDN code would oops and die if ipppd had compression 
enabled, but I hadn't loaded the isdn_bsdcomp or isdn_lzscomp modules.
Either specifying noccp on the ipppd command line, or loading the compression 
modules, fixed the problem for me.
You should also probably try the latest ISDN code snapshots, as they're very 
slow to get merged into Linus' kernel.
