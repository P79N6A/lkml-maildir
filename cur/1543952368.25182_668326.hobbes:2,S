Hi
I tested following.
 % ./hackbench 130 process 500
 (this parameter mean consume all physical memory and 1G swap space)
2.6.25-rc3-mm1: works well
2.6.25-rc5:     works well
2.6.25-rc5-mm1: doesn't finish >12 hour 
my bisect indicate the cause of bug is git-ia64.patch.
and, git-ia64.patch of 2.6.25-rc5-mm1 contain following patches.
    [IA64] cleanup and improve fsys_gettimeofday
    [IA64] Multiple outstanding ptc.g instruction support
    [IA64] VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING (accurate cpu time accounting)
unfortunately, I don't know how investigate more ;-)
Please any suggestion.
