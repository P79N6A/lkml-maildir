Ahh. That's because of a separate bug: we have this silly separation of 
"_TIF_WORK_MASK" (everything but tracing) and "_TIF_ALLWORK_MASK" 
(everything), and the system call stuff takes over _TIF_SINGLESTEP for 
some very non-obvious reasons.
I don't see why the system-call code thinks _TIF_SINGLESTEP is special, 
but it certainly explains why it doesn't get handled normally.
So the updated patch would look something like the appended.
Will test whether it cleanly handles your test-case. Davide - you also 
added the TIF_SINGLESTEP flag to that _TIF_WORK_MASK, can you explain 
that?
(And yes, I know you'd sent me the test-program before, but I'm about as 
organized as a Performing Seal with Alzheimers..)
