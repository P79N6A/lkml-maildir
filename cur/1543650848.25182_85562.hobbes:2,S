Well, with "foo" getting the ACL from "bar", changing the ACL of
"bar" would change "foo", but not vice versa. Of course, the idea
is that you're careful when changing "bar", just like you'd be
careful with your SSH keys.

chgrp -r gets nasty if you have files which are stored off-line.
On the other hand, using the concept that ACEs add rights, but
never take them away, even an off-line "ACL link target" would
fail on the safe side, by not adding more rights.

I've forgotten most things I knew about AFS ACLs (I used them at
IBM about eight years ago), but 
http://acl.bestbits.at/
 and in
particular 
http://acl.bestbits.at/cgi-man/acl.5
 seem to have
everything about POSIX ACLs. They're not very complicated.
