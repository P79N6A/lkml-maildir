It would have been very foolish to not clone 2.4. Worst case would have
2.5 cloned from 2.3 or 2.2, but the version tree would still be intact,
just a little indirect. (As far as I am aware, 2.5 is cloned from 2.4)

Nothing, assuming BK is a proper soure management system, which it should be.
In CVS? It would be big problems. But this is one reason why CVS is not
used for real projects such as the Linux Kernel.
