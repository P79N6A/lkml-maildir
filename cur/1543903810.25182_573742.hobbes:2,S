The compiler doesn't know how large the object at that address is, so
there's limits to how much alias analysis it can do.  If it assumes
you're passing a pointer to a single word then it may fail to order the
bit operation correctly with respect to another operation on another
part of the same bitfield (a memset to clear it, for example).
