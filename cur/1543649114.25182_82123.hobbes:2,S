I guess much of this is now early 2.7.x stuff. Does mean more time to
get it really clean and to figure all the hotplug cpu issues before they
hit the official Linus tree
The big one missing is 32bit dev_t. Thats the killer item we have left.
The rest is mostly driver work, and some forward porting of major 2.4
features not yet in 2.5.
I'd love the split console stuff if it was ready but its not vital, and
I really want to get ucLinux merged or mostly merged
