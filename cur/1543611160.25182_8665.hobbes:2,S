Ok I found the mail in some archives: it does not happen with
/proc/scsi/sym... but with /proc/bus/pci/xx (it seems that it messes the
scsi chip).
Here the answer (note that as a regular user you can't read more than the
first 128 bytes):

Both. :-)
You donnot want to read configuration space beyong byte 128 for chip
earlier than SYM53C896.

    It is exactly because a man cannot do a thing that he is a
