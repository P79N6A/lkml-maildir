As of now, there is enforced mutual exclusions between per-thread and system-wide.
The unavailable support is used to make the application aware that the whole PMU may
not be available, for whatever reason. For instance, today this is used when the NMI
watchdog is active. The unavailable mask will report that one counter is not available.
This will be generalized once we add a finer grain PMU register allocator underneath
perfmon (to be used by perfmon and NMI for instance). The way I envision this is that
you create the context, query what is available, assign event -> counters, load
context onto thread or CPU. That call could fail if some of the registers used became
unavailable in which case, you need to go through the procedure again.

This is handled in the code already today. Because I did not want to change
the event description table nor the higher level event -> counter logic of OProfile,
the mapping from Oprofile counter -> Perfmon PMC/PMD is done AFTER. With such setup,
it is hard to deal with unavailable registers detection once in perfmon code. I think
querying the unavailable register needs to happen BEFORE event-> counter assignment.
But that means that we need to provide a converter from Perfmon PMD -> OProfile
counters which is something i have not yet done.
Thanks for the patch.
