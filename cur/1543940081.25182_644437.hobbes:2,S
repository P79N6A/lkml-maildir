In the meantime I have measured the impact more carefully and posted the
results to the list:
- CONFIG_RCU_TRACE or CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU_BOOST not set causes high
  latencies up to 500..600us.
- CONFIG_NO_HZ=y increases the latency by 90 us, at least.
- CONFIG_PPC_BESTCOMM_GEN_BD=y seems not to harm.
Do you still get high latencies with:
  CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU_BOOST=y
  CONFIG_RCU_TRACE=y
  CONFIG_NO_HZ is not set
With this setting I have not yet realized latencies > 150us. Could you
please give it a try? If I change one of the parameters above, latency
increases in short time.
Thanks.
Wolfgang.
