	I personally don't go fixing stuff without having a full
undersunding of the context and why it was done this way. To me it
look this test was intentionally done this way, so there may be
something I don't know about. I guess I would need to double check
more closely what weid calculation the caller does with the buffer
size.
	That's why I would prefer a separate patch about those issues
that give the opportunity for the stakeholder to really talk about
this, rather than slipping it under the carpet.
	In the worse case, this is not a bug, this just means that we
may not use the last char of the buffer.

	Check the full source code of the caller, and you will see
that the caller does not care (and it's local to the caller).

	This error should never happen. If it happens, the caller need
to be fixed.

	Note that there are various other things that are puzzling in
this function. The internal object name and the symlinks are changed
even if the kcore rename returns an error. That does not seem right.
	But, this is separate from this patch...
	Have fun...
