Hi
Despite the warning in blkdev.h, that members of struct request starting
with hard_* are block layer internals, and no driver should touch them,
the ide_cd driver seems to fiddle around with it.
Is this reqd, or can this be made to work without the need for this?
If this reqd, why not provide a helper function for that in block layer
itself, may be, with a warning about usage?
Thanks
