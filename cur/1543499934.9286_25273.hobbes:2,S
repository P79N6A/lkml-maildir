i think this is a red herring - IRQ latencies _never_ cause even near to
15 msec delays even on low class 486 systems, unless there is some really
bad device in the system. So unless someone really analyzes what is going
on (i dont use soundcards myself so i cant really help) you might end up
solving the wrong problem.
do you get dropouts even if you increase the audio buffer to ridiculous
sizes? Does anyone have a technical explanation about why these dropouts
happen? I could also help solving this problem if there is any
audio-independent 'simulation utility' that shows similar symptoms to
those dropouts.
