To the extent possible, please list #include files in
alpha order within each group of <linux>, <asm>, etc.
+typedef enum _MAC_TAPE {
+	M_I17,
+	M_I20,
+	M_MINI,

+	M_NEW

What is TAPE?  should this be TYPE?
Use hard tabs on this line:
+      	.activate	= FB_ACTIVATE_NOW,
+static int             inverse   = 0;
+static int             mtrr      = 0; /* disable mtrr */
+static int	       vram_remap __initdata = 0; /* Set amount of memory to be used */
+static int	       vram_total __initdata = 0; /* Set total amount of memory */
+static int             depth;
+static int             model = M_NEW;
+static int             manual_height = 0;
+static int             manual_width = 0;
Misaligned.  Using hard tabs would help.
+		if (! strcmp(this_opt, "inverse"))
+			inverse=1;
No space between ! and strcmp (multiple places).
Do put spaces around '=' sign.
+#define dac_reg	(0x3c8)
+#define dac_val	(0x3c9)
Are these used?  And the parens are superfluous.
However, if you want to use parens, then using them here would
make more sense:
+#define	DEFAULT_FB_MEM	1024*1024*16
+	if(manual_height > 0)
+		screen_info.lfb_height = manual_height;
+	if(manual_width > 0)
+		screen_info.lfb_width = manual_width;
Space after 'if'.
+	printk(KERN_INFO "imacfb: mode is %dx%dx%d, linelength=%d, pages=%d\n",
+	       imacfb_defined.xres, imacfb_defined.yres, imacfb_defined.bits_per_pixel, imacfb_fix.line_length, screen_info.pages);
Break long source lines at < 80 columns, please.
+	if (imacfb_defined.bits_per_pixel <= 8) {
+		depth = imacfb_defined.green.length;
+		imacfb_defined.red.length =
+		imacfb_defined.green.length =
+		imacfb_defined.blue.length =
+		imacfb_defined.bits_per_pixel;
+	}
Maybe that last line should be indented one more tab stop.
Anyway, they shouldn't all be at the same indentation.
