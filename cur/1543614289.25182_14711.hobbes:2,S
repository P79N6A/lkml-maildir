Ok, i switched to kernel 2.4.17 and it happened again tonight.
Here's the output of ver_linux:
asterix:/usr/src/linux/scripts# ./ver_linux 
If some fields are empty or look unusual you may have an old version.
Compare to the current minimal requirements in Documentation/Changes.

Note that the kernel was compiled on asterix (another machine).
I also installed memtest86 and ran it a few days ago.
I still need to read up on its doc. but here is one error that came up
after HOURS of memtest86 running.
	Address:	190fe988; 400.90MiB
	Good:		00100000
	Bad:		00000000
	Error-Bits:	00100000
Does it mean there's a one-bit error in the first (400.90<512) 512MB Module? 
(This machine has 1GB memory in 2x512MB modules)
If so, I will remove this module and try again with only 512 MiB
memory.
    Bye, Stefan
