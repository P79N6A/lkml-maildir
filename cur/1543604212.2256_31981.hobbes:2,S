I agree with generally everything you say.
I think, however,  you are making two assumptions:
(a) xmms has a very large leeway in the timing of its execution
(b) the maximum time a process sits in kernel space is 10ms.
While I agree (a) is true, it may not be so in all scenerios. 
Furthermore, the specified leeway does not exist for all timing-critical
tasks.  Not all of these tasks are specialized real-time applications,
either.
Most importantly, however, the maximum latency of the system is not
10ms.  Even _with_ preemption, we have observed greater latencies (due
to long held locks).
This is why I believe the a preemptible kernel benefits more than just
real-time signal processing.
