Hello,
I am seeing some really weird behavior with my IPW2200 card.
I am connected to an AP (multiple Atheros cards with hostapd) and
WPA-PSK with CCMP encryption.
When the connection is fully idle, I do see those messages coming up
pretty randomly:
[41715.420882] ipw2200: Firmware error detected.  Restarting.
The card is then resetting itself, the connection is dropped for some
milliseconds, but all in all no harm is done.
Another situation happens when the card is on full load:
[38659.056980] __ratelimit: 21 callbacks suppressed
[38659.056985] CCMP: decrypt failed: STA=00:22:b0:bc:1e:2e
[38659.057638] CCMP: decrypt failed: STA=00:22:b0:bc:1e:2e
[38659.058005] CCMP: decrypt failed: STA=00:22:b0:bc:1e:2e
[38659.058356] CCMP: decrypt failed: STA=00:22:b0:bc:1e:2e
[38659.059127] CCMP: decrypt failed: STA=00:22:b0:bc:1e:2e
[38659.059637] CCMP: decrypt failed: STA=00:22:b0:bc:1e:2e
[38659.060123] CCMP: decrypt failed: STA=00:22:b0:bc:1e:2e
[38659.060671] CCMP: decrypt failed: STA=00:22:b0:bc:1e:2e
[38659.061046] CCMP: decrypt failed: STA=00:22:b0:bc:1e:2e
[38659.061641] CCMP: decrypt failed: STA=00:22:b0:bc:1e:2e
Those messages are repeated from time to time. The connection itself is
not being dropped, and netcat itself doesn't stop either, but for some
seconds, no packets are going through the WiFi link.
So, I am really curious about this, although not being fatal in itself,
the errors are pretty annoying.
I've added the respective Devs to the CC list, I hope this is OK.
One more sidenote though: I've been running IPW2200 for several years
with WEP and haven't experienced those errors yet, at least not in this
quantity. The card used to reset sometimes due to "firmware errors", but
please read "sometimes" as  "every two weeks once."
Another little question: will the card be supported by the new
iwlwifi/iwlcore/iwlagn drivers anytime soon, or will the "old" ipw2200
driver be the only one for this card? Someone really should update the
documentation, at least in the kernel build system regarding this,
currently "There is no help available." :)
Please let me know if you need any more information, I will hand it to
you ASAP.
Best regards,
Mihai Moldovan
