Did you remember to set dentry->d_fsdata to NULL?  This has to be done in
sysfs_remove_dir() sometime during the period when dentry->d_inode->i_sem
is held.  Right now the pointer to the kobject never gets erased.  That 
Badness message is an indication that you are using a valid pointer to a 
kobject whose refcount is 0.
