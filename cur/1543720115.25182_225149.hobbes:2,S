Sorry, the timestamps are part of the BK metadata and there isn't any way
to alter them after the fact.  
I'd suggest you not use the -T option to export or write a script that 
looks for timestamps in the future and fix them.
For everyone else, please keep your clocks in sync.  Whoever generated
these deltas must be running a very old version of BK (which is a license
violation by the way [whoohoo, we can now have 3 weeks of flames about
that horrible BK license that if people were obeying this wouldn't
have happened]).  Current versions of BK insist that your clock isn't
off by more than 24 hours (I suspect that this works only if you have
a net connection though, I don't remember).
