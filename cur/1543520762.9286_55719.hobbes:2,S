Subject: symbios 875 not finding scsi devices in 2.3.x?

Hello; I have a hard drive & 2 cdroms hooked up to a symbios 875
which used to work perfectly.
The scsi bios is able to detect the drives just fine, but the
Linux driver finds 1 host and quickly skips past the device
detection, which used to take 10-20 seconds.
Last time it worked was back in the 2.2.x days; has there been
a change to the way this works?  With the built-in Adaptec 7880
Linux is able to find everything...
Thanks,
Mark
