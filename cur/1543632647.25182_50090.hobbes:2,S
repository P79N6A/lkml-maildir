Each of the major viruses has probably got one author singular.
There are ways of making systems much more resistant to attack including
viruses. Things like RSBAC and the NSA security modules help you get
into a situation where this kind of stuff doesn't occur
	User1 gets a virus
	User1 owns a binary root users
	Root gets the virus
	Splat
Because with a trust model it goes instead
	User1 geta a virus
	User1 owns a binary root users
	User1 virus patches the binary
	Root is refused permission to run the binary because it no 	longer has
a high enough integrity
Even before that the lack of people checking GPG keys on RPM and other
packages is disturbing.
