I am trying to do exactly the same thing... unfortunately I have not had
much success getting it to work.  I have, however, solved your problem. 
What I did was 'touch -B 9999999 priv_part.c' which creates an empty
file with a timestamp of the current time minus 9999999 seconds. 
Because make will only recompile if the source is newer than the .o, it
will assume it is already compiled and it will just link it in.  I am
new to kernel development, so I haven't made much progress beyond
getting the module to compile without errors.  If you are able to get it
to work, please let me know.

The module comes as a binary-only object file with some sources that can be adapted to fit the specific kernel. My problem is that I can't figure out how to get the 2.6 kernel to include the binary part (it's in a .o file). The new build system does a little too much magic - compiling the module from source to .ko without giving me a chance to sneak in the binary code. How do I get it to link in the .o file, without making it look for the like-named .c file?
