All I see there are the calls just added recently by Oleg, which are
correct and necessary to fix a bug.  Wrapping it in something less magical
might be nice.  It is the right thing to do in any place that is
introducing an -ERESTART* error code without having just checked signal_pending.
Thanks,
Roland
