True, in fact it actively avoids using it.  The previous version used 
both the page cache and the dcache with undesirable effects on synthetic 
file systems so we removed cache support.  Our intention is to design a 
cache layer (similar to cfs on Plan 9) which handles cache semantics 
which can be parameterized with the appropriate cache policy depending 
on the underlying file server.

While 9P contains no explicit support for leases and cacheing there is 
an informal mechanism which is used (at least for plan 9 file servers).  
If the qid.vers is 0 the file can be assumed to be a synthetic file and 
so it is not cached.

Yup.  We have exclusive open semantics but not locks in the Posix 
sense.  Lock support is on our 2.1 roadmap.
