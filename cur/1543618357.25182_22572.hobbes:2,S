Hi,
I'm sending some feedback !
:-)
I'm trying this patch... (in 2.4.18-pre6)
I'm feeling a improved performance ,as a desktop user.
I'm working with KDE2, Netbeans and VMWare.
Pentium III 666Mhz , 192M Ram, 10GB HD.
What are the tools to check this better performance?
Or my impression is sufficient ?
Thanks
Mauricio
