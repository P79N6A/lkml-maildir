Wrong! A returned value of 0 is perfectly correct for mmap()
when mapping a fixed address. The attached code shows it working
perfectly while returning NULL, that event being put on the
terminal.
Any kernel changes that break this code are wrong. There are
many 'C' runtime library functions that signal a problem (or
should signal a problem) by returning NULL. That is, however,
the documented behavior of those procedures. Even malloc()
which __should__ show a failure to allocate by returning NULL,
doesn't work that way because the allocation never fails
(even if you are out of memory) as long as the user address
space hasn't been corrupted by the user (overwriting buffers).
The seg-fault you get when you de-reference a pointer to NULL
is caused by the kernel. You are attempting to access memory
that has not been mapped into your address space. Once that
memory gets mmap()ed, you will no longer get a seg-fault.
Again, the seg-fault has nothing to do with 'C'. It's an
implementation behavior that can be changed with mmap().
