Yes, this particular driver is fine. My patch just eliminate back-to-back
 	release_region(...)
 	if (!request_region(...)) fail;
pair.
I just have a feeling that if I am going to replace check_region with
request_region, I can close race window altogether.
BTW, it all started when I tried to get rid of check_region in de4x5.c.
That's a bit worse. For example:
        barrier();
        request_region(iobase, (lp->bus == PCI ? DE4X5_PCI_TOTAL_SIZE :
                                DE4X5_EISA_TOTAL_SIZE),
                       lp->adapter_name);
        lp->rxRingSize = NUM_RX_DESC;
