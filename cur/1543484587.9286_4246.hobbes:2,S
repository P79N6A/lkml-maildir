Since the subject of Digital Unix, Linux, and NFS came up, I have a problem
in the opposite direction.
I am running the user space NFS server on a Linux 2.2.1 machine and my
/etc/exports file contains:
    penguin4> cat /etc/exports 
    /group (rw,insecure,no_all_squash)
    /home (rw,insecure,no_all_squash)
On Digital Unix 4.0D machines running the automounter with the flags:
    /net -hosts -rw,intr
I can not automount the linux machine from the DU machine.  However:
1) I can mount the directories by hand on the DU machine.
2) If I run knfsd on the linux machine the DU machine can automount.
3) If I remove the insecure,no_all_squash options then DU can automount.
4) Solaris and Linux machines have no problems automounting the Linux machine.
Can anyone confirm this?
Thanks,
Jim
