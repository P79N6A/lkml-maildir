I wouldn't be too worried about doing fractions.  Make it unfair and
charge it to either the container who first instantiated the file or the
container who faulted on that page first.
Though the part that seems important is to be able to define a directory
in fs and say all pages belonging to files underneath that directory are
going to be put in specific container.  Just like you are having
resource beans associated with sockets, have address_space or inode also
associated with resource beans. (And it should be possible to have a
container/resource bean without any active process but set of
address_space mappings with its own limits and current usage).
