Hi Jeff,
I'm submitting a set of bug fixes for inclusion in 2.6.21.
The patches are built against Linus'git tree.
Here is a brief description:
- ethtool -g/G should only apply to queue sets bound to the given port,
- the driver will attempt to load the FW if it hits a version mismatch,
- monitor the MAC for a potential hang, and triggers a recovery mechanism
  for the T3B2 asic ,
- T3B2 does not lose its pcie config space on reset.
Cheers,
Divy
