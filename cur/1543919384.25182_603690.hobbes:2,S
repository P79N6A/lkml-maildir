This is the old ata_sg_is_last:
static inline int
ata_sg_is_last(struct scatterlist *sg, struct ata_queued_cmd *qc)
{
        if (sg == &qc->pad_sgent)
                return 1;
        if (qc->pad_len)
                return 0;
        if (((sg - qc->__sg) + 1) == qc->n_elem)
                return 1;
        return 0;
}
and the new one:
static inline int
ata_sg_is_last(struct scatterlist *sg, struct ata_queued_cmd *qc)
{
        if (sg == &qc->pad_sgent)
                return 1;
        if (qc->pad_len)
                return 0;
        if (qc->n_iter == qc->n_elem)
                return 1; 
        return 0;
}
->n_iter is how ata_qc_next_sg() walks over the sglist, I don't
understand your reference to why depending on that during iteration
would be bad?
So we could add a test for sg_last() there, but that would turn sg table
iteration into an O(N^2) operation for those drivers that use
ata_sg_is_last() with chained sg tables. I'd much rather just get rid of
ata_sg_is_last(), it's only used to mark end-of-table entries for
hardware. That logic can be performed cheaper.
Torsten, your analysis does look correct. Does it work with this simple
patch?
