Well, this is of course the easiest way to achive what you are wanting
to do.  Only you can answer the "how I'm going to maintain this in the
future" question :)

No, you still need the driver to be around :)
Anyway, you can get a notification from udev whenever a device is bound
to the cdc-acm driver, and then trigger your "disconnect/connect" script
on that.

I don't know how fast the above will all work out, you are going to have
to test it yourself, sorry.
hope this helps,
