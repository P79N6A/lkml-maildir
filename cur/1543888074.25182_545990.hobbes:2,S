When I tested this on ARM, the output for je32_to_cpu et al was fine.
For _other_ structures where I'd used __attribute__((packed)) to be
safe, gcc would emit code to handle unaligned loads. But not in the
simple case where the struct has only one member.
Are you suggesting that this has changed since I did my testing?
