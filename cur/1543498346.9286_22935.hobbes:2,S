Huh? You don't even need to serve device files over the network.
The /dev filesystem exists only in client memory.
If you want to serve a real /dev for older clients, you still have ext2.

That won't help you at boot. Hacks like initrd might work, but they
also make Linux more complicated.

Not necessarily, but it can support them better than the current system can.
Trying to do dynamic device numbers and/or names with the current system
is a bad joke.
