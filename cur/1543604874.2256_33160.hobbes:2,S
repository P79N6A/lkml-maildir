2. is there any funtion in the network device driver source by accessing

i am trying to write or modify the eth device driver(3c509.c) in such a
way that i can statistics of the traffic and then i also want to
identify teh traffic. in short i want to incorporate a function in my
driver which when acceseed would act as a sniffer/protocol analyzer .
