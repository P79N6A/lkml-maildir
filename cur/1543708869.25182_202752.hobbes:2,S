Same kernel or Mandrake 10 beta which 2.6.3 + godknowswat. Acpi enabled.
whether the acpi module is actually loaded or not does not seem to affect anything,
but acpi is on according to dmesg.

it doesn't appear to matter, but I have "strange" peformance problems that may
or may not be the same. Suddenly some things are very slow, welll 1.2GHz is still
fast, but..  How do I see the actual CPU frequencey? cat /proc/sys/cpu/0/* gives 
2000000 0 0 where 2GHz is max on this machine. I have not seen speed as anything
but 2GHZ.
One of the strangenesses similar to Bob's problem is that games run slow, i.e. blobwars 
have not trouble running fast on much slower machines, but on this one it runs in 
slow-motion. Another program that displays this problem is eclipse, although I don't know
if it's related.

Yes.

There's a setup for enabling/disabling speedstep that says sets the frequency
to the lowest if "disabled".
