There are other issues with disktest, in that you can easily specify 
option combinations that generate apparently 5+ GB/s of IO, though 
actual traffic over the link to storage is very low.  Caveat disktest

I agree.  The backing store should be a disk for it to have meaning, 
though please note my caveat above.

Unfortunately, I agree.  Bonnie++, dd tests, and a few others seem to 
bear far closer to "real world" tests than disktest and iozone, the 
latter of which does more to test the speed of RAM cache and system call 
performance than actual IO.

Here is what I have run:
disktest -K 8 -B 256k  -I F -N 20000000 -P A -w /big/file
disktest -K 8 -B 64k   -I F -N 20000000 -P A -w /big/file
disktest -K 8 -B 1k    -I B -N 2000000  -P A  /dev/sdb2
and many others.
