dev_queue_xmit() does it, all you need to do in your driver is:
	/* If packet is not checksummed and device does not support
	 * checksumming for this protocol, complete checksumming here.
	 */
	if (skb->ip_summed == CHECKSUM_PARTIAL) {
	      	if (skb_checksum_help(skb))
	      		goto error_recovery
	}

Yup, the cost is in touching the data, not in the copy.

Only because I just wrote it for my needs. If you need it, then it
can be moved to skbuff.c
