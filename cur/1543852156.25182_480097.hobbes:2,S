Subject: Re: [PATCH] make last_inode counter in new_inode 32-bit on kernels that offer x86 compatability

And the last one is xfs_mapping_buftarg().  I am completely at a loss.
As far as I can tell, inode allocated, partially initiated and -
leaked.  Am I missing something?
STATIC int
xfs_mapping_buftarg(
	xfs_buftarg_t		*btp,
	struct block_device	*bdev)
{
	struct backing_dev_info	*bdi;
	struct inode		*inode;
	struct address_space	*mapping;
	static const struct address_space_operations mapping_aops = {
		.sync_page = block_sync_page,
		.migratepage = fail_migrate_page,
	};
	inode = new_inode(bdev->bd_inode->i_sb);
	if (!inode) {
		printk(KERN_WARNING
			"XFS: Cannot allocate mapping inode for device %s\n",
			XFS_BUFTARG_NAME(btp));
		return ENOMEM;
	}
	inode->i_mode = S_IFBLK;
	inode->i_bdev = bdev;
	inode->i_rdev = bdev->bd_dev;
	bdi = blk_get_backing_dev_info(bdev);
	if (!bdi)
		bdi = &default_backing_dev_info;
	mapping = &inode->i_data;
	mapping->a_ops = &mapping_aops;
	mapping->backing_dev_info = bdi;
	mapping_set_gfp_mask(mapping, GFP_NOFS);
	btp->bt_mapping = mapping;
	return 0;
}
