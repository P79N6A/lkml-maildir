Subject: [PATCH 0/4] [RFC][PATCH] fs-writeback: redefining the dirty inode queues
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Andrew,
I'd like to propose a cleaner way of using the s_dirty, s_io, s_more_io
queues for the writeback of dirty inodes. The basic idea is to clearly
define the function of the queues, especially to decouple s_diry from
s_io/s_more_io.  The details are in the changelog of patch 2.
The patches are some cleanups on top of Andrew's s_dirty time-ordering
patches and Ken's s_more_io patch:
[PATCH 1/4] writeback: check time-ordering of s_io and s_more_io
[PATCH 2/4] writeback: 3-queue based writeback schedule
[PATCH 3/4] writeback: function renames and cleanups
[PATCH 4/4] writeback: fix ntfs with sb_has_dirty_inodes()

Note that the patches need rework for inserting into the right place of
your queue of -mm patches. I'll take care of it in the next take.
Thank you,
Fengguang
