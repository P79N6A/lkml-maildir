Hi,
I found this in the ChangeLog from 2.6.5 to 2.6.6-rc1:
> <greg@kroah.com>
>	USB: mark pwc driver as broken, as it is.
>
>	And the maintainer doesn't seem to want to fix it :(
Could somebody please tell me what this is referring to?
I searched the archives for pwc and did not find anything
recent.
This seems to be a perfomant driver and I would like to use it 
for my application, but if the statement above is true I would
have to rethink my plan to buy philips ToUCams...
Thanks!
Mathis
