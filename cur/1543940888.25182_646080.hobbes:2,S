DFS support has never been in any smb client except Windows and the
user space smbclient (but only for about a year) - it has been in
Samba server for a while.   The final piece necessary for DFS support
has not been merged but is expected in the next few weeks - Christoph
and others noticed some problems during the review of the patch series
that I would like to address including rewriting CIFSDFSGetReferral.
lack of automatic netbios name resolution for the server name portion
of the UNC name was discussed in earlier posts - but can be done in
mount.cifs.  More intricate techniques (probing via astat for netbios
name discovery - would require more kernel code)
