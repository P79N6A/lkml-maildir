    My guess is that you have a miscompiled losetup utility. Most losetups 
    compiled with glibc 2.0 are broken, because glibc changed the size of dev_t
    without bothering to supply a linux/loop.h replacement (struct loop_info 
    contains dev_t). Compiled with a 32bit dev_t you really need set 
    lo_encrypt_type, and the kernel obviously doesn't know how to deal with 
    lo_encrypt_type 2048. 
    Unfortunately there is no easy way to fix losetup without introducing
    glibc version dependencies, because glibc offers no public function to convert
    its dev_t (from its stat wrapper) into a kernel dev_t.
The current code in util-linux does
#include <linux/posix_types.h>
#define dev_t __kernel_dev_t
#include <linux/loop.h>
#undef dev_t
which is not very elegant but as far as I know works on all systems.
