I don't think it makes much sense to fix this in individual
filesystems as many functions returning -NOMEM can be used in other
paths as well where they're ok.
Andrew, please consider picking this up for -mm. (I've included it as
an attachment as well as gmail will surely mess up the patch. Sorry.)

[PATCH] VFS: return ENOBUFS instead of ENOMEM for vfs_write()
As noticed by Dmitry Torokhov, write() can not return ENOMEM:
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/functions/write.html
Currently almost all filesystems can return -ENOMEM due to
generic_file_buffered_write() in mm/filemap.c so filter out the invalid
error code in vfs_write().
