What I'm saying is that I almost always want copy_user() to put the
destination data in the cache, even if it isn't cached yet.  Many
copy_user() calls are for for data structures that easily fit in the
cache and the data is usually used quickly afterwards.
As for cache-hints supported by IA64: the architecture supports
various non-temporal hints (non-temporal in 1st, 2nd, or all
cache-levels).  How these hints are implemented depends on the chip.
On McKinley, non-temporal hints are generally implemented by storing
the data in the cache without updating the LRU info.  So if the data
is already there, it will stay cached (until a victim is needed).
