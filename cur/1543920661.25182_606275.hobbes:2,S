I thought PCI-X devices could operate on a PCI bus? If that is true, 
then the presence of a PCI-X device would not necessarily imply the 
presence of a PCI-X bus, right?
There are no external PCI-X slots in the system, only 2 PCI slots.
The 4 NICs are integrated to the motherboard.

So the 01:0f.0 device (Multimedia video controller) is on the same bus 
as the 4 PCI-X devices and will have to share the bus bandwidth?
Does 66MHz+ in the Status line means this device is running at 66 MHz?

Can I use lspci to see whether a specific PCI device is using a 64-bit 
data path? (e.g. the 01:0f.0 device)
Regards.
