During a mixed load test including fsx-linux and a bunch of procs
running cp/read/rm loops, I got a null pointer deref with the call
trace:
__lock_page->sync_page->block_sync_page
I don't see how we can trust page->mapping in this path, can't it
disappear?  If so, it would be a bug without Jens' patch too, just
harder to hit.
