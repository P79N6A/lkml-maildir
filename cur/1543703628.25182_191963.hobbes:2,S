Err... Not in the case where someone else has the file open for writing.
In that case, the i_sem can be held for quite long periods of time 'cos
NFS has to flush out conflicting writes, and it has to serialize w/r
reads on pages.

Is there really any sane application that relies on 2 threads sharing
the same file descriptor, and doing llseek()/read()/write() without some
form of userland serialization mechanism?
It sounds to me as if that is going to be pretty much broken whether or
not we protect the integrity of f_pos in the kernel.
