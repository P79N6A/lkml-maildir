    Strictly speaking that's the "frequency at which 'times()' counts", ie
    the kernel CLOCKS_PER_SEC, not HZ. But from a user perspective the two
    should hopefully always be the same (if any of the /proc fields etc
    should really use CLOCKS_PER_SEC, not HZ).
I would hope nobody actually uses the above.  Since I run kernels
with HZ==2048 and started having to hack various userland tools to
make them happy I too was after this information.
However, it was pointed out that eliminated HZ completely might be a
better idea, and then just exporting all values to userspace as
nanoseconds or similiar... a radically different approach to what we
have now but something that struck me as a really good idea.
Fodder for 2.5.x perhaps?
