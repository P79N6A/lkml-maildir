RCU is really mostly used as a garbage-collection scheme, and hence its 
latency, while it can be practically problematic in some cases, never is 
directly visible in terms of application or kernel behavior.
the same is in this case: the call_rcu() use is for gathering totally 
unused task structs. There should be no side-effects.
