I wonder if we could gather some usage statistics, especially WRT
really old hardware.
Perhaps we could invent some MODULE_WARN_OBSOLETE thing which would
warn users about their drivers being removed in +6m (or maybe +12m),
unless they let us know at 
http://qwe
 or mailto:ads?
I find it really hard to believe there are still users of things like
CDU-31A CDs, XT MFM disk controllers, or NCR5380 SCSI host adapters
(especially the real ones, not DOMEX etc. clones bundled with scanner
just ~ 10 years ago).
