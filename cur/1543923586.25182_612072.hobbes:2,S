Meanwhile, it's not sexy to have such warnings from sysfs core, not
from the caller side.
The (untested) patch below may fix the problem.  Now the standard
register_sound_*() is used for old OSS code.  Please give it a try.

Use the standard register_sound_*() functions instead of calling
device_create() directly in the old OSS core code.
