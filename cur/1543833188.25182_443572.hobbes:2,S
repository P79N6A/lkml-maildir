ok good. that's what i thought also.

but in order to be useful, the uid 0 in other namespaces will need to have
some capabilities.

I think user namespace should be unshared with filesystem. if not, the
user/admin should know what is doing.

yes, that would be the ultimate user namespace.
I think that this first patchset lays some infrastructure that is already
quite usable in a container which already isolates file, pids, etc and not
only users.
now, we could work on extending it to support fine grain user namespace
which i think can done on top of this first patch.

yes you could expect that to check the i_uid against fsuid but should we
enforce it completely ?
we already have an issue today with a simple NFS mount on 2 hosts with
different user mapping. namespace can't fix all issues.

please elaborate ? i'm not sure to understand why you want to use the keys
to map users.

good let's start digging !
