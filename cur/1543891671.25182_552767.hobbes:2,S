There is no particular reason.  '3' should be a reasonable value for
most people.  If actual users want to change this value, I can make it a

It was more or less discarded.  As long as the sweet spot for LogFS is
small systems, saving memory is more important than multithreaded
performance.  Will add it to the list.
