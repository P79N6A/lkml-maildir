Instead of just coming with kbd-1.00 I was unwise enough
to announce that it was to be expected soon. Unfortunately
that produced an avalanche of keymaps, fonts, unicode patches
and the like, and I have not treated all of them. However,
I made kbd-1.00wip available so that people sending patches
can make them relative to it - there are many changes compared
to kbd-0.99.
