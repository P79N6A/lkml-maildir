[I have only 2.5.3 sources here yet]
Can you also check for size >= PAGE_SIZE on enter to entry->show()
procedure? It looks ugly to me that each driver has to check for this
constant unless it wants to smash some innocent kernel memory.
And neither of driverfs_read_file nor driverfs_write_file supports
semantic we use with other filesystems: If at least one byte was 
read/written, return byte count (even if error happens). Only if zero 
bytes was written, return error code.
                                Thanks,
