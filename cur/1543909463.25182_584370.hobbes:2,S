Yes, you'll definitely hit that BUG if the N_HIGH_MEMORY mask is empty.
So far, I can't see how this could be, tho'.  __build_all_zonelists()
should be called for non-NUMA as well as NUMA.  It iterates over "all
on-line nodes"--the N_ONLINE state, which is initialized to have node 0
on-line.  That should work for a non-NUMA i386, right?  
In the loop over all on-line nodes, __build_all_zonelists() sets
N_HIGH_MEMORY for each [on-line] node with ANY present pages--i.e.,
non-zero pgdat->node_present_pages.  Then, check_for_regular_memory()
will set N_NORMAL_MEMORY for any nodes with non-zero zone->present_pages
for any zone <= ZONE_NORMAL.  
I don't have an i386 test system to verify this, but from cscope, it
looks like the pgdat, including node_present_pages should be setup in
the following call path:
	start_kernel()->setup_arch()->zone_sizes_init()->
	free_area_init_zones()->free_area_init_zone->
	calculate_node_total_pages()
This is called before build_all_zonelists()--also from start_kernel(),
so node_present_pages should be non-zero when we populate the N_*_MEMORY
states...
Any ideas, anyone?
