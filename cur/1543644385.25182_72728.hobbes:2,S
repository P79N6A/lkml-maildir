That may just be due to the new mouse driver and/or input layer, which 
went in some weeks ago. What kind of mouse (and if it is a PS/2 mouse, can 
you get a loaner USB mouse to test with, for example?)

There was a separate MTRR atomicity problem that would cause extreme 
slowdowns on SMP with MTRR enabled when X was started, because the MTRR 
code would have re-entrancy problems and potentially leave the caches 
disabled. That should have been fixed in 2.5.36.
