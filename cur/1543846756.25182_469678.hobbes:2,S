yep :), I clearly missed the point you made there:

I've re-read it, hope I've got it right this time.

Not sure I get it still though. Is the issue more than just the location
of the irq validation code? If yes, could you explain what are the
differences between your proposal and Jeff's ?
Anyway, let me have another try at summing up the issue:
#1
- generic irq validation code in include/linux/pci.h
- arch specific irq validation code in include/asm/pci.h
- is_irq_valid() called by pci_request_irq()
BTW this is much like it's done for pci_resource_to_user()
#2
- generic irq validation code in include/linux/interrupt.h
- arch specific irq validation code in include/asm/interrupt.h
- include/linux/pci.h includes linux/interrupt.h
- is_irq_valid() called by pci_request_irq() - and maybe others? -
Thanks,
Frederik
