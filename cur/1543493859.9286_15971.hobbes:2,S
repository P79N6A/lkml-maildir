I previously sent the email below to linux-serial.  I still have the
problem, and nobody on either the pcmcia-lists or the linux-serial
list has been able to help me.
Since I suspect that this is a kernel problem, i forward the letter to
this list.

I use a 3CCFEM556B multifunction (100/10 LAN + modem) card on an
Ascentia 810N.
When I switched from kernel 2.0.35 to 2.2.1, the modem ceased to work.
When I try to access it (e.g. by statserial) I get the error message
"Device or resource busy".
Since can be an indicator of IRQ collisions, I tested with
  setserial /dev/modem irq 0
This makes it work, so it really seems to be an IRQ problem.
However, I've now followed instructions on how to deal with IRQ
collision problems, and it doesn't help to move the IRQ.
I'd very grateful to get any kind of hints about how to approach the
problem.  I have read the relevant HOWTO:s and README:s and I have
posted a message on the PCMCIA lists.
(Please also respond by email, since I'm not on this list.)
