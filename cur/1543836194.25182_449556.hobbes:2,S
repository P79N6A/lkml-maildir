I see a small, but nonzero harm from keeping them, for two reasons.
One, I reviewed a patch for RHEL-4 today, where the submitter copied
this code without thinking. So, if we don't flush these, they will
proliferate. Hackers assume that if Greg wrote that, it must be the
right way. Two, these calls shrink the race window and may be
masking something.
