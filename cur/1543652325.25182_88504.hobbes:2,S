Now figure in the rotational latency and the crossover point has
moved to 200 kB. ;)

Besides, larger requests are much more efficient so penalising
those is the very last thing we want to do.

It only makes sense under heavy multiprocessing workloads where
we have multiple processes submitting IO, but if it's just one
process all this deliberate delay will achieve is a slowdown of
the process.
