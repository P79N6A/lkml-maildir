Dear sir,
I would like to report a subscription problem for the linux-kernel.
I subscribed to the linux-kernel-digest list, and I was getting message feed
from the list.
But on Thu 21 Jan, the messages (digests) from linux-kernel stopped coming. The
last digest I got was V1 #3225.
At first, I thought the linux-kernel had a temporary congestion problem --- you
know, the 36-hours delay problem you had before, --- and I didn't pay attention.
But nothing came for 3 straight days.
Then I re-subscribed to the linux-kernel-digest list, and the message feed came
through again. Only now it begins from V1 # 3244, which means I've missed 18 of
the digests (3226 - 3243).
I am reporting this problem to you sir because I did not unsusbcribe from this
list, but somehow the l-k list majordomo had dropped my name.
Perhaps I am the only one who got the name dropped, but perhaps, there are
others who had their names dropped too, since there _is_ a problem somewhere.
And also, can someone please tell me how to get digest # 3226 to # 3243?
I have tried to get the majordomo to sent me the back-issues, but it just
doesn't do anything.
Thank you for reading, and have a nice day.
Bob
