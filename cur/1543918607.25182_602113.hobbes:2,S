That's a lot of effort.  Is it more effort than doing some remote
debugging with Christoph?  I don't know.

Yet here we stand.  Christoph is aggressively trying to get slab removed
from the tree.  There is a testcase which shows slub performing worse
than slab.  It's not my fault I can't publish it.  And just because I
can't publish it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
Slab needs to not get removed until slub is as good a performer on this
benchmark.
