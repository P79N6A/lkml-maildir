thanks, we can certainly do something like this, i've added a variation of
this to -C1. One thing your patch misses: we need to update the event
counter when we remove RT tasks as well.

i had something like this in previous scheduler versions and it was
deadlock land. But i agree that we can do better and i've already started
relaxing the draconian RT locking rules again in my tree. (that's not in
-C1 yet.) But it's much more complex than what you describe, because the
->policy value and ->cpu can change as well, so locking in this manner has
to be done very carefully.

not applied. I had this in the very first version of the O(1) scheduler,
it was called expire_count:
+               unsigned long nr_running, nr_switches, expire_count;
i replaced it with the current estimator, which works much better in a
number of trickier workloads.

i found this to be a too simple approach that doesnt work for some
workloads. The history-based load estimator i wrote is sound from a
theoretical point of view, it calculates an integral of the load value and
thus represents the load history of the task accurately.
this estimator is well-tested under a number of workloads which do break
under simpler schemes like the switch-counter based estimator. (the
4-entry history estimator clearly beats even some estimators that are more
accurate than the switch-count based estimator - like the run/sleep
timestamping estimator or the single-entry history estimator.)
the way i developed/tested the estimator was to put the system under
various extreme loads and i traced interactive processes. If they were not
working smoothly (ie. they were starved of the runqueue despite their
interactive nature) then i changed the estimator.
so if you'd like to replace it then please do not do it casually, trace
the difference under a number of important workloads - i have done so.
