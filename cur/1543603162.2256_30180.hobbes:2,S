I realize that this is a FAQ item, but the information contained therein
is a bit sparse.  I have an Abitbp6 motherboard with dual celerons 533's
not overclocked.  The bus is 66mhz.
My boot params are (from dmesg)
Kernel command line: BOOT_IMAGE=linux2410 ro root=2203
BOOT_FILE=/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.10 hdc=ide-scsi noapic
The BIOS is set for MPS 1.1
These are both recommended in the FAQ (as is trashing the Abit mobo, but
that is not feasible at the present time).
I am of the impression that with the noapic parameter all calls are to
be handled via CPU0, yet I am getting several errors on CPU1 as well.

The errors are fairly divided between CPU0 and CPU1 54/43 per dmesg,
although this seems to indicate otherwise.
The last series of errors is fairly representative:
APIC error on CPU0: 02(04)
APIC error on CPU1: 04(08)
APIC error on CPU1: 08(08)
APIC error on CPU0: 04(04)
APIC error on CPU0: 04(02)
APIC error on CPU0: 02(02)
Can I assume there is no kernel solution to this problem; and is there a
way for me to quantify potential/probable file corruption?
Thanks,
Rinaldi
