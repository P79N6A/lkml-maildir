Whether we have true securelevels or securelevels implemented with
capabilities, its still damn handy to be able to flip between them.
Securelevels handle the majority of cases in a UNIX way.  Capabilities are
cool, but they hark more of the mainframe world.  Some Linux based "systems"
may be put together that use them to the full, but UNIX with a Linux kernel
will never truly use capabilities beyond a few token things.  The model is
too drastically different.
