What FLASH are you talking about? I work with NAND FLASH chips directly
in embedded projects, and for both Toshiba and Samsung NAND FLASH the
erase time of 128Kb (64K words) block is 2 milliseconds typical. Page
program time is 0.3 milliseconds typical, so, having 64 pages per block,
total erase-write block cycle is about 22ms.
Those chips indeed support about 100K program/erase cycles. Well, maybe
there are some new NAND FLASH chips that support more program/erase
cycles (just checked Samsung but found none), but I doubt they are 1000
times slower for block erase anyway.
