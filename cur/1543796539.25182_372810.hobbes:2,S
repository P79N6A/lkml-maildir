Dominik one thing I noticed a while back was that ondemand also polls at a 
frequency that creates a timer at around 140 HZ. Tweaking the ondemand/ 
tunables and making it poll ten times less frequently made a big difference 
to this (obviously) but did obviously slow down the scaling speed - this was 
the frequency required to bring it to that of the background timers (<=20HZ). 
I see scope for this polling to be dynamic too :D
Cheers,
