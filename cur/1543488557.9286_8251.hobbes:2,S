I would say yes. I did some thread creation latency benchmarking across
2.0/2.1,w&woSMP/winNT/BeOS on a UNI machine and 2.1 NON-SMP rocked them all
(the only one that could compete was solaris x86 (data mesured using the
tsc register)).
here are the results:
           OS            |Average latency|average min lifetime
        tb.lin.2.1.su.out:     15429.88     43262.35
        tb.lin.2.1smp.out:     24820.78     73181.09
            tb.lin.su.out:     36952.43     47082.92
                tb.be.out:     97613.29    133678.29
          tb.nt.cgw32.out:    150206.23    194500.16
                tb.nt.out:    146374.37    177591.14
(solaris was left out because I did it on a pII 400)
these are in clock ticks of an AMD k6-233. all the benchmark did was create a
thread and wait for it to finnish, all the thread did was record the value
of the tsc register.
this is not a good overall benchmark but you can see that the smp kernel can't
schedule thread creation and deletion as well as NON-SMP.
couldn't you use an initrd image to select between two different kernels?
cheers, Angus.
It would seem that Christopher McCrory (chrismcc@netus.com) said:
