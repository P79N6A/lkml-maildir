In the past I would grab the headers of the kernel of which I compiled
glibc against.  glibc has #ifdefs in it to turn on/off some features
based on the kernel version.
Are there plans get a sane set of kernel headers together that can be
used by userspace (at least glibc) that properly describe the features
of the current kernel, so the C library may take advantage of them?
