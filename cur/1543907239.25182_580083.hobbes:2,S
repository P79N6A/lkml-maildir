The mask that sbp2 set was because sbp2 has (in theory, not yet in
practice) a _narrower requirement on address ranges than the chip_ ---
hence it has (in theory) a narrower requirement on DMA mappings than the
ohci1394 driver has.
That's because sbp2 uses the controller in a special mode, as a bus
bridge.  It is the only user of that feature among the higher-level IEEE
1394 drivers.  No other IEEE 1394 application-layer software has this
requirement.
(Well, debugging and forensic tools rely on that mode too, notably
BenH's firescope, but this software runs remote, hence it's a different
beast from sbp2.)
