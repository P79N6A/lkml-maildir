The "good enough" of gcc may be architecture dependent. Taking the 
option away where it works because somewhere else it doesn't may not be 
the optimal solution.

The last time we discussed this the team working on e100 said there were 
still issues (IIRC). Have they all been resolved?

We have been over this several times, and I thought someone had taken 
over the driver and was providing patches to put it in. Both skge and 
sky2 have been proposed as the replacement, people have reported 
problems with each. Suggest leaving this alone until the sk98lin 
actually needs work, then take it out. Problems in my problem system 
have been intermittent, take 4-40 hours to show and generate no errors, 
other than the driver thinks it's sending packets and the sniffer doesn't.
