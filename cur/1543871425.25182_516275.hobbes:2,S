Well, it very much uses "do_div()", so that it can do a
	64 / 32 -> (div64,mod32) 
divide, which is often faster than a full 64:64 divide.

Nope. You need both the result of the division *and* the remainder, and 
you can't do that with a single multiply.
Also, with modern hardware, divides are usually fairly cheap, with early 
exit logic, so that the common case of small integers is fairly cheap. 
Yeah, generating a full 64-bit number printout is still expensive, of 
course (both because you need to do many divides *and* because only the 
last few divides will be able to do any appreciable early exit logic.
Anyway, I think a full integer divide on Core 2 is something like 22 
cycles. Yes, the multiply is much fasster (at 4 cycles), but I think that 
22 cycles is actually worst-case.
Somebody who has a benchmark could try.
