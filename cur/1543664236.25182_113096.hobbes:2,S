Why?  Since the option syntax is regular, presumably programs simply
ignore options they don't understand.  No?

Please, no.  don't pollute the root (_especially_ with little one-use
directories like that).
/var is clearly the right place for this; if /var isn't mounted
initially, I'd suggest that mount should simply not update any file at
that point, and the init-script that mounts /var can be responsible from
propagating information from /proc/mounts to /var/whatever.
