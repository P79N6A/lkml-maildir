Ok, will do.  I'm not real sure about list etiquette here.  A discussion
is underway on <
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7476>.
  Here
is the code I've posted there.  (Slightly newer versions here.)
First is a C program -- a test harness that embeds the new touch_cache()
routine (needs memory management work to go into kernel).  Then a shell
script I've been using to torture it.
The torture script tests it with cache lines up to 66-longs, and with up
to 656-way streaming (artifacts of the shell's $RANDOM ;-)
Moved this to my home account so I have some control over the mailer...
