Hello Group,
I am a newbie to Linux. I have Linux Rh 7.2 installed on my Dell Latitude
C640 Laptop. It is partitioned with Win 2K professional as the other OS. I
included some Xircom and Cisco WLAN card modules in the kernel configuration
and recompiled the kernel. A problem then came up when I rebooted my machine
with the new kernel. It failed to mount my root file system.
I then included the ext3 file system module with the kernel and then
recompiled it and rebooted it again.
It still did not boot up and gave me a " Root fs did not mount " and the
booting process just stays there doing nothing. I did the same thing on my
second Dell C640 Latitude notebook and it gave me the same problem.
Any help in this matter would be appreciated.
Regards,
Vivek.
