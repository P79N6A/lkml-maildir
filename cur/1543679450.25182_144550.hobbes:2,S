I have done this little patch for the procfs_example.c
diff procfs_example.c 
kernels/linux-2.4.20/Documentation/DocBook/procfs_example.c
87,91d86
< static int open_qp(struct inode * inode, struct file * file)
< {
<   printk("Open my node %p %p \n",inode,file);
<   return -EINVAL;
< }

<       foo_file->proc_fops->open=open_qp;

And when loading this module. The procfs gets broken. I get EINVAL for 
open on
/proc/meminfo and all other procfs info. Why? Should procfs inodes don't 
have full
filesematics? And it don't help to unload the module.
Strange. And a look in generic.c in fs/proc/
static struct file_operations proc_file_operations = {
    llseek:        proc_file_lseek,
    read:        proc_file_read,
    write:        proc_file_write,
};
Is this saying that we can not have the other fops on procfs inodes? No 
ioctl,open ?
