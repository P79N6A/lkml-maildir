	That's easy enough to say but AFAICT there doesn't seem to be any easy
well to tell the good from the bad from the just plain ugly.  I
typically don't buy junk (I didn't think), but I've definitely
experienced this, first hand, with Sony Memory Vaults, SanDisk CF cards,
some SimpleTech CF cards, some SmartMedia cards (what an oximoron that
is), and now this 1G USB stick (which was, I admit, an "off brand" I had
never heard of before at Frys Electronics).  The CF cards were burned up
in a PDA, so it's not just this.  For a myth, I've definitely seen too
much of it.
	Strangely (and in response to another comment someone made) some USB
cards which I reformated for ext2 have survived quite well.

	Now THAT I gotta check into.  I never noticed anything on the packaging
about a guarantee, but I will now.  But how do you determine which are
"decent" keys?  They don't put stickers on them saying "this one is
decent" and "this one is junk" and I'm an old cynic who has learned that
price is not always a good indicator either.  Maybe the guarantee will
be a clue.  I've just got to shop for it more.

	Yeah, several of us have noticed the performance issue!
