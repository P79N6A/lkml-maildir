Hi Tim.
That would be great if you could find that patch - I can worry about
porting it to the current kernel.  We're having an issue where our
device, while routing large amounts of network traffic, reports 0% CPU
utilisation when it cannot be the case, and I think this is the cause.
Cheers,
Tom Burns
