Hi,
	I have become a Git freak and I build a new kernel on each of my
systems every 2 days or everyday, I do a git pull from Linus tree and
then do a kernel-image with debian.
	Is anyone really interested if anything happends on the proccess on any
of those installs/upgrades or what should I do when a problem comes up?
It's appreciated.
.Alejandro
