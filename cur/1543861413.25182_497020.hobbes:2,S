I noticed this too in April 2006, see:
http://lists.lm-sensors.org/pipermail/lm-sensors/2006-April/016016.html
Quoting myself back then:
"The whole sis_96x_compatible stuff looks superfluous now. It was used
before 2.6.0-test10, but we could certainly get rid of it now."
I do not think there is a bug here, or someone would have complained by
now. Note though that I do not have a SiS-based motherboard to test on.
Mark may be able to help with testing.
Thanks,
