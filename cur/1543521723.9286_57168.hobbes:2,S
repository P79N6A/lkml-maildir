from ./include/asm-i386/posix_types.h
#ifdef __KERNEL__
#define UID16_COMPAT_NEEDED
typedef unsigned short  __kernel_old_uid_t;
typedef unsigned short  __kernel_old_gid_t;
#endif /* __KERNEL__ */
/linux/include # grep -in "old_uid_t" */*types.h
asm-arm/posix_types.h:42:typedef unsigned short		__kernel_old_uid_t;
asm-i386/posix_types.h:34:typedef unsigned short	__kernel_old_uid_t;
asm-m68k/posix_types.h:34:typedef unsigned short	__kernel_old_uid_t;
asm/posix_types.h:34:typedef unsigned short     __kernel_old_uid_t;
linux/types.h:36:typedef __kernel_old_uid_t     old_uid_t;
Either 
#ifdef __KERNEL__
or
#ifdef UID16_COMPAT_NEEDED
is needed around the group IMHO........Alan...the answer is???
