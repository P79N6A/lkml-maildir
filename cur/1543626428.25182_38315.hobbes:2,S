I'd prefer to have the BKL just moved into the functions that need it, and
removed altogether from do_exit().
That's especially true as I don't know if sem_exit() actually needs the
BKL any more at all - so that if it doesn't, we can just remove it from
there (at which point it is a local implementation issue, rather than a
cross-module thing).
The disassociate_tty thing falls under a similar heading - we're going to
have to fix up the tty layer some day anyway, let's make the BKL detail a
tty layer internal thing.
