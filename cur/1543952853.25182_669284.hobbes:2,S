OK!  I'm planning to just add:
+/*
+ * Use the given filehandle to look up the corresponding export and
+ * dentry.  On success, the results are used to set fh_export and
+ * fh_dentry.
+ */
 static __be32 nfsd_set_fh_dentry(struct svc_rqst *rqstp, struct svc_fh *fhp)
 {
 	struct knfsd_fh	*fh = &fhp->fh_handle;
(Nothing about "who calls it", but it's static and its only caller is
fh_verify, so that seemed uninteresting.)  Anything else you were
looking for?

If I had a little more time I think it might be clearer to make this:
	fhp->fh_export = nfsd_fh_get_export(rqstp, &fhp->fh_handle);
	if (IS_ERR(fhp->fh_export))
		return ERR_PTR(fhp->fh_export);
	error = nfsd_setuser_and_check_port(rqstp, exp);
	if (error)
		goto out;
	fhp->fh_export = nfsd_fh_get_dentry(rqstp, &fhp->fh_handle);
	if (IS_ERR(...))
etc., though that's probably not quite right.
