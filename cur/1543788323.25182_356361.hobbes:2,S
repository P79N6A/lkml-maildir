Can't check now, but what I mean is that syslog will only give one line,
that an USB device is inserted. Nothing more. I can find the device in
/sys/usb... so the system sees it, it just doesn't know what to do with
it.
Will checkup on libusb, I'm not a programmer though. Know a little C++
syntax, but no API's and this hardware stuff is way beyond me for now.
Can get you the USB device ID's and such if you would like those.
