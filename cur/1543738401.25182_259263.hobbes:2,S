Why can't theese patches be maintained outside the kernel tree , as it is 
now ? 
I'm strongly against this because the X-Box is a gaming platform and last I 
heard ( and I could be wrong here ) is that you had to hack your X-Box in 
order to load any other os then the one supplied with it. I just don't see a 
justified reason why theese patches should be included into the kernel.
