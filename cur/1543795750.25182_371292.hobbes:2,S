Good call, revised patch below.

I don't think so.  Since hugepages are never disk-backed, I think the
PageDirty flag is more or less irrelevant.
Fix crash when ptrace poking hugepage areas
set_page_dirty() will not cope with being handed a page * which is
part of a compound page, but not the master page in that compound
page.  This case can occur via access_process_vm() if you attemp to
write to another process's hugepage memory area using ptrace()
(causing an oops or hang).
This patch fixes the bug by only calling set_page_dirty() from
access_process_vm() if the page is not a compound page.  We already
use a similar fix in bio_set_pages_dirty() for the case of direct io
to hugepages.
