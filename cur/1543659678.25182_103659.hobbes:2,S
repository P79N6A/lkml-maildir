Well I never got SIGILL as would be expected. I got SEGFAULTs
and I'm only speculating that a CMOV was encountered.
But yes that does seem to be what's happening, the
CMOV corrupts something global to many apps, and
"every now and then" SEGFAULT.
You could quickly check your system with something like:
find /bin -perm +111 -type f |
while read bin; do
     objdump --disassemble $bin 2>/dev/null |
     grep -q cmov && echo "$bin has cmov"
done
