This is usurally not true for kernel patches, the directories are mostly
named a and b. You can however deduce the to-bepatched version and the
patched version from the filename.

Same issue.

Or: bzcat patch1 patch2 patch3 | (cd linux-oldversion && patch -p1)
Finding out if a patch applied correctly
---
A quick check is to search for .rej files. Unfortunately some errors 
How do I undo a patch?
---
You can undo a patch by supplying the -R switch to patch. If you patched 
using zcat ../patch.gz | patch -p1, zcat ../patch.gz | patch -Rp1 will 
undo the changes as long as the patch applied correctly.
Common errors while patching
---
"File to patch:"
  Patch could not find a file to be patched. Most probably you forgot to
  use -p1 or you're in the wrong directory. Less often, you'll find
  patches that need to be applied with -p0 instead (you can't just omit
  -p0!).                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  ^^^^^ [IIRC]
  Sometimes this is the result of an incomplete tarball, a out-of-space 
  error while unpacking or a fsck.
"Hunk #2 succeeded at 1887 with fuzz 2 (offset 7 lines)."
  The patch was applied, but it might be applied to the wrong place
  because you patched the "wrong" source. The result might not work
  correctly.
"Hunk #3 FAILED at 2387."
  The patch could not be applied correctly. This is usurally fatal, except 
  if you apply external patches to the stable series (e.g. to 2.6.23.42
  instead of 2.6.23) and the reject is in the toplevel Makefile.
  (You'll have to manually edit the Makefile and change the version string 
   as recorded in Makefile.rej)
  If you apply more than one external patch, the same thing will happen, 
  but there is no guarantee for a working kernel (the changes may bite 
  each other).
  You can most likely recover the source tree by undoing the patch and 
  removing the .rej and .orig files. YMMV.
"Reversed (or previously applied) patch detected!  Assume -R? [n]"
  Either you really applied the patch before, or the patch is for some
  other source. If this is not the very first message, the source is
  most likely unusable by now.
"patch: **** unexpected end of file in patch"
  Your download is broken. Re-get the file.
