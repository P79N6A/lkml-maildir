I find the c) feature very convenient. For instance it allows reliably
downgrading a link connected to a switch without having to fiddle with
the configuration of the switch, something which is usually (pick your
favourites) non-standard, painful, not authorized, not implemented,
buggy,...
Command line parameters of the bcm5700 driver do implement c) (among
other nifties). Documented in its man page. Command line parameters of
e1000 also allow some control over the autonegociation process, even
if not using c) but a different (and less user-friendly) syntax. See
Documentation/--/e1000.txt. From David's words, I suspect this feature
is simply missing from ethtool.
Finally, silently ignoring user input is not very user-friendly IMHO.
I would much prefer a) to b).
I am aware that my preferences are probably in inverse order of the
amount of work required.
PS: I read netdev but not linux-kernel
