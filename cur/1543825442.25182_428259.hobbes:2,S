Yes, the 2 devices are PCI devices. We tried enabling CONFIG_PCI_MSI,
also tried pci=routeirq, but cat /proc/interrupts still show the
devices sharing the same IRQ. It is interesting how each of these
options (ie routeirq, CONFIG_PCI_MSI, noacpi, etc) causes the kernel
to assign a different IRQ each time, but the 2 devices are always
shared, eg
pci=noacpi -> 169: 5140 IO-APIC-level bttv0, uhci_hcd:usb1
pci=routeirq -> 153: 1253 IO-APIC-level bttv0, uhci_hcd:usb1
I guess there's no workaround for our problem. If there are any more
suggestions, please let me know, we hope the pci latency settings will
get us going for now.

Keith
