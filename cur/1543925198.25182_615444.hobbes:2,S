Mel [anyone?]
Do you know what the plans are for your "onezonelist" patch series?
Are they going into -mm for, maybe, .25?  Or have they been dropped.  
I carry the last posting in my mempolicy tree--sometimes below my
patches; sometimes above.  Our patches touch some of the same places in
mempolicy.c and require reject resolution when changing the order.  I
can save Andrew some work if I knew that your patches were going to be
in the next -mm by holding off and doing the rebase myself.
Regards,
Lee
