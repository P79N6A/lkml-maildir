Ah, shit. Thanks luca, this was my fault. Never cut'n'paste via mouse 
on important occasions.                                               
Sorry guys, this was my fault, not Marcelo's.                         
BTW, for the further ongoing of this patch, I ran into the question if
MODULE_PARM(type, "1-(16)i");                                         
                                                                      
would be a valid statement. I guess not. But if not, could some kind  
soul please explain to me how to get rid of the braces "(" ")" given  
in definitions from CONFIG stuff.                                     
                                                                      
E.g.:                                                                 
                                                                      
CONFIG_ME_BEING_DUMB (16)                                             
                                                                      
entering above MODULE_PARM contruction via a definition. I searched   
the source tree a bit, but did not find any hints.                    
                                                                      
Regards,                                                              
Stephan                                                               
                                                                      
PS: I _will_ re-check the next patches several times, I swear ... :-)
