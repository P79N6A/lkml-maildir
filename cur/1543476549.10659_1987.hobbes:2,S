Stupid question: is it possible to teach it to recognize the deadlock ?
If I understand things right "nice behaviour" happens when we don't have
the deadlock and the deadlock occurs not very often. So we might check
once a second whether we have been low on memory for a while with a lot of
swap available and if so revert to "bug-proof" behaviour.
