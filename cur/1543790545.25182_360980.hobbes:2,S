You're right, when I mount the floppy with "-o sync", touch fails 
immediately (I did try earlier sync(1), as somebody suggested, and it 
didn't matter; yes, I know about the difference between sync(2) and 
fsync(2)). On the other hand, umount is supposed to flush all the data 
by the time it returns yet still it succeeded.
But overall I agree that we're discussing a situation which should never 
happen in the first place, i.e. remount should fail.
