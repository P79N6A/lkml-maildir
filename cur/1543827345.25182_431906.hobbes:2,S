Here are some more comments for you.
1.  There are quite a few lines (17) ending with ^M (carriage return)
that should be removed.
2.  Lines like this one should end with a period (full stop):
+This file is SPARC-only
3.  I would put this comment near the top of each file, not at
the end:
+PLEASE KEEP THIS FILE ORDERED ALPHABETICALLY.
Other than that, it's looking good to me.
Thanks,
