This is still not fixed because we (linuxtv.org) have not submitted the 
changes necessary following this thread:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=108344912617115&w=2
This is about firmware loading in those modules, and we are working on 
converting those modules to i2c_kernel to take advantage of firmware_class.
Could the offending modules be marked as broken or something untill 
linuxtv-dvb can test and submit the dvb frontend updates, which should be 
sometime soon, but probably not in time for 2.6.8?
