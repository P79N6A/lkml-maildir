the issue I see is that AA may not have to implement any new in-kernel 
infrastructure to do this.
as recently as yesterday there have been discussions on the netfilter list 
about how to implement filter rules based on the application name (see the 
thread titled 'filter by application name') if this gets implemented 
independantly of AA then AA could provide a policy implementation layer 
over netfilter if desired (or sysadmins could just use their current 
favorite tool to control the network and AA to control the filesystem)
so holding up AA becouse this isn't implemented yet seems to be counter 
productive. people are working on this, and it is going to go in at some 
point independantly of AA, so why tie AA to it?
IPC is a very imprecise term. it includes lots of different ways for 
processes to communicate with each other. some forms of IPC are covered by 
AA today (unix sockets), others aren't. but each of the different methods 
is going to involve some difference in how it's controlled. if you want to 
talk IPC be specific about what IPC methods you are talking bout limiting.
