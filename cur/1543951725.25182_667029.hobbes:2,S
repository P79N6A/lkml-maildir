You could stretch the terminology that way, yes.

Yet if you go into a parts catalog, you'll see that regulators
and switches (low side, high side, etc) are different parts.
Also, that many (most?) regulators aren't switchable.
Given my druthers, there'd be no repurposing of common terms
like "switch" and "regulator".  That's all I'm getting at; in
normal usage, they are two different things.  (And what we
care about is their output -- a power domain, possibly shared,
possibly somewhat controllable -- not how it works.)
