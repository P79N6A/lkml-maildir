Are you running the _same_ version of linux that worked with the drive
that broke?
If not, try an older kernel.  The current one could be buggy in some
way.
Assuming that the new drive is the only difference, try using hdparm
and deliberately run a slower transfer mode than what you do now.
Or try turning off DMA.  The new drive could have different
timing requirements, and fail to work with a linux setup "tweaked"
for the other drive.  Windows don't necessarily use the same
transfer speed as linux and could be fine because of that.
Also, consider mounting /var synchronous.  This is slow, a 
debugging-only thing, but you stand a better chance of logging
the failure in /var/log/syslog.  (You have looked there
already?)  Any kind of error message will help us
find out whats wrong.  You may also want to try
booting without X to see if you get any oops/panic/bug
messages on the console when it crashes.
