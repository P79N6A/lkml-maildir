Since 2.6.18 it goes
acpi (generic calling add_memory)
add_memory (generic)
arch_add_memory (x86_64)
__add_pages (generic)
The generic add_memory call is good as it does the dynamic pgdat
allocation for new nodes.  The generic add_memory call need the correct
node infomation.  
Do you think we should do 
acpi (generic calling add_memory)
arch_pre_add_memory? (x86_64)
add_memory (generic)
arch_add_memory (x86_64)
__add_pages (generic)
? 
It would just create a function hook. 
Thanks,
