Subject: Upgrading to 2.2.19pre to fix do_try_to_free_pages bug

Hi all,
I've been running into the do_try_to_free_pages problem on a server
running 2.2.18 and I just wish I'd looked at the list earlier to see
if it was a known bug.  (And I'm relieved that it is a known bug, I'm
just surprised that I hadn't hit it earlier!)
Now that I know there's a fix in 2.2.19pre*, I need to upgrade.  Since
I have limited opportunities to reboot (this is a Samba server for
student labs, and the coming week is the last week of term with
everyone working on their assignments), I need to be reasonably sure
that 2.2.19pre17 doesn't have any known showstopper bugs.
So, does anyone have any comments on whether or not 2.2.19pre17 is a
good move, or should I be looking at an earlier 2.2.19pre?
This is a dual PIII/600E, with a Mylex RAID controller, one 3c905B NIC,
an on-board Intel EEPro 100 interface, ext2 filesystems and disk quotas. 
Thanks in advance for comments.
Martin
