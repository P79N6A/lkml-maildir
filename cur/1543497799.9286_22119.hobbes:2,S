So I created  a 17 gig file using Linux 2.2.9 & a file in /tmp.  Interestingly
enough at 17 gig I get an error 22 ( still have space & inodes available ) .
YOU ALSO NOW HAVE A CORRUPT / BUSTED-SUPER-BLOCK in the partition.
fsck wants to use an alternate superblock, and suggests using 8192(?), which
doesn't work. :-\
this is the little pgm used to create the 17gig sparse file.
So I guess its not a 2/4gig boundary problem anymore.
gat
BTW it may be that fsck cant handle it ( redhat 5.0 vintage ), but I dunno at the
moment :( It just at reboot time, i always force a fsck. Removeing the 17gig file
didn't help :-(
Pgm used:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

/* This can kill the superblock on the partition the file is written on */
/* Which may not be recoverable                 gat 6/5/99      */
/******************** BE CAREFULL *******************************/
main()
{
        long    l,r;
        int     e, w;
        int     fd;
        fd = open("c",O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC);
        for ( l=0; l < 64000000000L; l+=1000000) {
            r = lseek(fd, l, 0);
            w = write(fd,"a",1);
            fprintf(stderr,"r=%lx, w=%d, l=%ld\n", r,w,l);
        }
}
