Excuse me for adding my irrelevant 0.2$ - but what are you doing with Linux
then?? Why don't you just stick with NT and improve NT? If you want NT
source - you can buy it from M$ and the only point that speaks against NT
(as it seems from reading your words) will vanish - you will have NT
sources, kernel debugger, nifty GUI for all the stuff, trained developers,
nice tech support. Let me ask you once again - why are you sticking with
Linux?
