I guess reasonable is a subjective term. For instance, I've seen quite a
few people vehemently against adding new ioctls to the kernel and yet
you'll be adding quite a few for /dev/snapshot. I'm just of the same mind
as Nigel in that it makes the most sense to me that the majority of the
suspend/hibernation process to be in the kernel.
And I realize lzf compression isn't in the main kernel yet, but cryptoapi
was designed to be modular so that new things can be added later if
necessary and deflate is already there, so it's not like there's no
compression algorithms included yet.
