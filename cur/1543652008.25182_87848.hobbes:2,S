Hello again!
1)
As you'll all have noticed, the makefile for the build wants QT installed for
a simple build process.
2)
PCMCIA module ds.o cannot be loaded -> somehow the kernel denies that.
3)
atimach64 console driver makes blank screen on
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc 3D Rage P/M Mobility AGP 2x (rev 64)
I know, the video driver didn't work in any kernel version, but I am interested
in fixing that. I don't know where the problem is located, but I would beta
test drivers, if available. I would also help to trace down the problem,
with little help from the developers.
Is there any development with this driver ? Or is it simply dead? I can't 
find any contact in any of the kernel source files...
Please tell me what todo with pcmcia/ati, I want to have those things
usable, not only for me.
Nico
