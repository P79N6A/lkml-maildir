Try removing and reinserting the PCMIA card
at the point where the boot hangs.
Also, make sure you are using a tecra kernal (if there is a choice).
After the install consider upgrading the kernel and PCMCIA package.
Kernel 2.3.4 and pcmcia 3.0.12 work well for me in a
sattelite 2545Xcdt, though sound needs to be compiled
into the kernal rather than a module.  Also the BIOS should
be set for PCIC and enhanced IDE.
Config file on request.
Good luck!
