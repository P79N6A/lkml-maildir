I've added the following code to count lappings.
I also measured speeds of hands from pgrefill* and pgscan* in
/proc/vmstat.
While executing
	$ while true; do cksum zero; done
, where zero is a 1100MB file and the amount of the system RAM is 1GB,
Hcold was almost twice faster than Hhot in ZONE_DMA32 (the system was
x86_64), and Hcold was steadily overtaking Hhot.
(Interestingly, in ZONE_DMA, Hhot was faster than Hcold.  I think this
can be ignored for now.)
I thought this situation means that page access frequencies cannot be
correctly compared and leads to suboptimal performance, but I couldn't
prove that.  However, I've managed to create an example workload where
clockpro performs worse.  I'm not sure if the example is related to
this hand problem.  I'll describe it in the next mail.
