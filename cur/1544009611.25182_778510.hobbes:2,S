That distro is SystemRescueCd v1.1.3(2.6.27.7) 64bit and yes it has MCE
enabled and it logged the usual single MCE after booting into it. From there
I mounted my debian 64 bit(2.6.27.8) partition, chrooted into it and kexeced
my 64bit 2.6.27.8(which, if booted directly from power up, gives the
usual single MCE after boot)
kernel and this time no MCE appeared. I still haven't rebooted and no
MCE appeared.
