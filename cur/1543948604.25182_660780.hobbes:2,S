It looks like that's done in other drivers in case MODULE isn't defined.  I'm
assuming this is historical at this point, and manual options parsing can
be removed from all fb drivers at this point, or is there another reason
why manual parsing would be necessary?

Yeah, I wasn't actually sure about that; I did check for other fb drivers
documenting stuff in kernel-parameters.txt, and didn't see it.  It looks
like they instead document stuff in Documentation/fb/.  Which is preferred?

I can certainly change that.  Regarding convention, I toyed with renaming
it 'vram' (as most of the fb drivers use that), and will probably do
that unless Jordan objects.
