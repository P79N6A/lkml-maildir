That is only invoked *IF REQUESTED BY USERSPACE*.
This is the real termination:
        if(!reboot_thru_bios) {
                /* rebooting needs to touch the page at absolute addr
                0 */
                *((unsigned short *)__va(0x472)) = reboot_mode;
                for (;;) {
                        int i;
                        for (i=0; i<100; i++) {
                                kb_wait();
                                udelay(50);
                                outb(0xfe,0x64);         /* pulse reset low */
                                udelay(50);
                        }
                        /* That didn't work - force a triple fault.. */
                        __asm__ __volatile__("lidt %0": :"m" (no_idt));
                        __asm__ __volatile__("int3");
                }
        }
Zero the IDT and force an interrupt -> triple fault.
