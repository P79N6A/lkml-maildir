OK.  So I'm late to this thread.  But is everyone
_sure_ hardware isn't a problem? Yes, turning SMP
off solves it, but that also reduces 5 V power
consumption by 3-5 Amps (not-oc, normal load).
FWIW, I have an Abit BP6 with only one UDMA33 disk.
No hot video card.  I'm stable at 2 * 5.5 * 98 MHz
even under heavy load from my `cpuburn` tester.
I can also run at least four instances of
    dd if=/dev/hda4 of=/dev/null bs=1024 &
Without causing ANY lockup.  I can thrash the head
actuators by changing hda4 to hda1 for few of them.
Still no trouble.  Of course, I use short cables
for UDMA33.  2.2.13 SMP.
But I have a 300W power supply, and it still sags
0.20 V.  The original poster had 12 disks in his
box.  Multiple powersupplies, I hope.  Was a 
voltage check done (lm-sensors)?
OTOH, the BP6 may have some problems freeing some
IRQ's.  Perhaps the newly released BIOS will help.
