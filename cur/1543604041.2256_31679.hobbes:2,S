this is netgear's gige over copper card. it does not use the acenic
chip.  instead it uses the national semiconductor 83820 chip and a
different driver. this driver did not go into the kernel until ~2.4.10
(ns83820.c) and does not work under sparc64 so far -- it seems to
compile, load into the kernel, receive ethernet packets, but packets
never get to layer 3 AFAICT.  if anybody has had better luck, please let
me know.
btw, anybody know where to get acenic gige copper cards anywhere? for
the life of me, I cannot find a place that sells them anymore.
