the difference is not that big and only in tradeoffs. eg pax trades
virtual address space against protecting a rare occurance (eg where exec
shield wouldn't work because of a high executable mapping. That really
doesn't happen in normal programs)

Exec Shield does that too but only if your CPU has hardware assist for
NX (which all current AMD and most current intel cpus do).
