I'm not sure there is. This goes back to what is really being measured 
as "block I/O delay".
Earlier iterations of the code tried to measure total block I/O delay 
including I/O submission
and the wait for completion:
    
http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0602.3/0905.html
In that design, the swapin delay was being measured as time spent in the 
do_swap_page
function:
    
http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0602.3/0906.html
However, Arjan pointed out the difficulties in trying to account for all 
I/O submission paths
so we reverted to measuring just the block I/O wait time within 
io_schedule/io_schedule_timeout.
Since these functions will be called as a result of do_swap_page, the 
only way to distinguish a
block I/O being done for a swapin vs. others was to mark the task struct 
in some way and
task->flags seemed like a convenient way to do it.
We could easily introduce and use a separate flag variable in the delay 
accounting structure itself if
using up another bit of task->flags is a concern ?
Or do you have doubts about the methodology of using a flag itself ? 
Don't see any other lightweight
way of doing this.
