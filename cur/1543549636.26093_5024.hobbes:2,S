There are 3 ways: 1- dropping packets (obvious), 2- buffer packets and delay
retransmission (if the receiver gets the packet later, it will ACK it later,
ie you play with the timeout value without touching the window size of the 
trasnmitter and you don't need to drop packets), 3- use (or misuse ?) ECN.
