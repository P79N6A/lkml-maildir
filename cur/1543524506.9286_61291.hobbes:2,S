Hmm, doubtful it's a compiler bug then.
To rule out any hardware problems, this is a K6-233, with 64mb. 
I've not had any problems with any other kernel/app recently.
Other hardware in the system shouldn't make a difference to the
core TCP/IP stuff I'd have thought.
I'm not using any other modifications to the kernel other
than prepatch 5. I'll reboot later to some older kernels and
see if the problem was there too.
Anyone with any other ideas?
