Linux uses structs full of function pointers. The functions might not
have global scope, but must be called via the pointer. They may be
considered member functions of a class. NULL is typically used to
represent inheritance, though a dummy function can be used instead.

No, it is known.

Note the choice of a NULL value of dummy function. This is a performance
optimization that a C++ compiler would not make with a class.
Linux hackers make the choice based on the fraction of calls that
go to the default and based on what the default must do. The compiler
won't know if the cost of checking for NULL is more or less than the
cost of calling a dummy function some of the time.

1. If it isn't broken, DON'T TOUCH IT.
2. Loss of flexibility is a concern.
3. Complexity is in the eye of the beholder. All C++ is complex. :-)

Question for you:
Should people who obviously don't have an understanding of the design
of a language or how it applies to large high-performance projects use
it for large high-performance projects like the kernel?

Somebody _will_ use such features. Somebody else, without a solid
understanding of that part of C++, will add more code. Want bugs?

C++ support counts as a feature, so: Adding C++ support will become a
tremendous effort just in terms of predicting its impact on the rest
of the system much less attempting to implement it.
