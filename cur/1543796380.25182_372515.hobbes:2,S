OK... Looks like it is bailing out after the lines
link("/etc/passwd.2522", "/etc/passwd.lock") = 0
stat64("/etc/passwd.2522", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0600, st_size=5, ...}) = 0
I'll bet the stat64 is filing to show that the file now has 2 links.
As a first step, could you please grab the 2 patches
  
http://client.linux-nfs.org/Linux-2.6.x/2.6.15-rc4/linux-2.6.15-01-nfs-cache-init.dif
and
  
http://client.linux-nfs.org/Linux-2.6.x/2.6.15-rc4/linux-2.6.15-02-fix_cache_consistency.dif
and see if they fix the problem?
Cheers,
  Trond
