Subject: [PATCHSET] sysfs: sysfs rework, take #2
Hello, all.
This is respin of syswork rework patchset in gregkh patch series.
Changes are...
* ida implemented and used to allocate sysfs_dirent inode numbers
  instead of using pointer values which caused problems on certain
  configurations including 32bit userland on 64bit kernel.
* reordered patches a bit such that minor updates added later are now
  in the front of the patchset.
* 09-sysfs-flatten-and-fix-sysfs_rename_dir-error_handling added.
* 12-sysfs-add-sysfs_dirent-s_name now updates syfs_rename_dir() such
  that the renaming is reflected in sd->s_name.  This fixes netif
  rename problem.
* lockdep annotation updated to handle sysfs nodes deleting other
  nodes properlyand merged into 17-sysfs-implement-sysfs_dirent-
  active-references-and-immediate-disconnect
* patches which fix fallouts of kill-attr-owner conversion were added
  19-sysfs-kill-unnecessary-attribute-owner.  Source tree is scanned
  with grep and brace matching perl script and more fallouts have been
  converted.
* reimplement-sysfs_drop_dentry() patches are completely redone.  This
  was necessary because there was no way to look up the dentry
  matching a sysfs_dirent for shadow directories, not without getting
  the hands all dirty with dcache internals.  Please read descriptions
  of patch #20 and 21 for more info.  This fixes two races conditions
  around sysfs dentry/inode reclamation which triggers BUG_ON().
All the known regrssions are fixed.  I think I've got all the
attr->owner but haven't verified with cross compiling yet, just
allyesconfig on x86-64 and i386.  I'll try to setup some cross compile
environments tomorrow and follow up if I can find more fallouts.
The patches are against Linus's master branch of the day -
