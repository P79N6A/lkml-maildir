Subject: problems with sound and mouse with 2.6.0-test4-mm1

Hi!
I just tested the test4-mm1 version of the kernel, it works quite well,
except for a couple of things:
1) ALSA modules for emu10k1 are working, but the sound is kind of noisy
on xmms.
2) I cannot succesfully start X with "nvidia" propietary modules, Xfree
worked with the "nv" driver, but my mouse is not getting the scrollball
to work. I used test1-mm* and all of thise worked, sound wasnt a lot
better than now, but it was better.
Any sugestions ?, attached config and lsmod. 
Max
