I am connecting to a share exported on a Windows NT 4.0 Workstation
(SP3) system.  The files inside a specific directory are marked
read-only on the Windows side (ie. -r-x-r-x-r-x displayed in ls -l).  If
I attempt to do an "rm -rf" to remove this directory (called 'temp'
containing a file called 'file' that is read-only), I get:
rm: temp/file: Permission denied
rm: temp: Text file busy
If I 'chmod' this files to 644, I can remove the directory without
incident.
Is this correct behaviour?
Mike.
