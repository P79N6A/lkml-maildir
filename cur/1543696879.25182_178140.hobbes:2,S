Hi Trond,
 just by incident I found one reason when an user space application can get
the ESTALE in our setup (Linux client RH-2.4.20-18.7smp, Solaris 2.8
Server). I accidentally run iozone on two clients with the output file
being the same and residing on the NFS Server. Pure luser error, but it
produced ESTALE pretty much reproducibly.
B^HCheers
Martin
