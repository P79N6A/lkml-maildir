Interestingly, while this whole thread is full of diverging views, there
is nevertheless considerable common ground.
- Getting a trace output is very useful, whether it is generated from
dynamic or static tracepoints. You need some infrastructure (e.g.
relayfs + a few things) to get the data out efficiently.
- Some sort of static markers make sense in key locations. Whether they
are there "primarily" for dynamic or static tracepoints is mostly
irrelevant. Interesting suggestions were made for a syntax clearly
identifying their "probe point" status.

This is a case where it started with inline code but as you take into
account SMP and eventuelly multiple traces (e.g. the sysadmin is tracing
the system and a user is generating a trace for his processes) it
becomes larger and inlining may not be such a good idea any more, to say
the least. However, this is relatively easy to change.
It is also worth mentioning that code patching NOPs to minimize the cost
of inactive tracepoints was envisioned quite some time ago. Again you
might call these "static low overhead placeholders for optimized dynamic
tracepoints" or "optimized low overhead static tracepoints"... You need
however to be careful when code patching instructions on SMP as it may
not be trivial to atomically replace 5 NOPs by a call.
