  doesn't anybody know what the problem is? while it was reported quite
a few times there was no helpful response to the problem (positive
(fix)or negative (it's unlikely to be fixed).
  I mean I would expect that somebody at least suspects what the problem
is and can say whether there is any chance it will be fixed or otherwise
shed some light on the problem. anything...
  I am talking about the via and audio ripping problem. I have tried
2.4.17, 2.4.18 and 2.4.18 with ide patches from linux-ide.org
(2.4.19-pr7 didn't compile)
  ?
  TIA
