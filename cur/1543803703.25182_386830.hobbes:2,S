I'll see if I can find a more specific version...I already know we can't 
use anything between 2.6.13 to 2.6.15, maybe including 2.6.15.1 (I'd have 
to test that) because of some sort of either SCSI or aic7xxx driver 
problems.  Even 2.6.8 I occasionally have to cycle our tape library and 
reset the tape server when for some reason the kernel manages to deadlock a 
tape drive when we have more than one tape drive going at once.
