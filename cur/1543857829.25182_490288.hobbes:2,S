hostap_cs is hard-coded to request IRQ_TYPE_EXCLUSIVE
I think it was Bjorn Helgaas who observed that a device doing such
a request is not seen, and thus not honored by ACPI when the
physical IRQs are handed out.
The immediate question is why this fragile creature broke after 2.6.15.
By default, we avoid re-programming interrupts in PIC mode.
Is CONFIG_PNPACPI enabled in both kernels?
Need the dmesg -s64000 and /proc/interrupts output for last working
and first broken kernels.  Maybe best to file these in a bugzilla entry.
