Hi all,
I know it's not the best approach to the problem I'm attempting to 
solve, but I'm attempting to fork a thread and exec a process from 
inside the kernel.   I tried creating a kernel thread and attempted to 
exec from there.  I actually make it into my child thread, but the exec 
doesn't appear to do anything.  Any ideas how to do this.
Eric
