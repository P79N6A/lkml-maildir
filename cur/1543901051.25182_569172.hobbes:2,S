I have no problem regenerating the patchset without this allow-NULL
patch but as I said, I see it as an improvement and we'll have to agree
to disagree on that point.  But, if you think NULL get/put() are bad,
please go ahead and change things.  As long as things stay consistent,
I'm okay with, well, even slightly prefer not allowing NULL.
Thanks.  :-)
