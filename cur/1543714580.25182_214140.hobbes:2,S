Would it not be worth Nvidia advising the vendors (possibly already
done) that there are nForce BIOS issues causing reproducable hard
crashes with their existing BIOS versions with relation to the issue
here? I realise that these manufacturers (in my case ASUS) may have no
obligation and have their own product schedules of course.
There would seem to be many people puchasing nForce based systems and
many will not find out how or why there is the problem.
I for one, will not be buying another nForce based motherboard until I'm
sure this issue is sorted properly. Yes, I will probably find issues on
other boards, but I have no such hard crashes on an old P3 Sis chipset
board, a VIA KT Abit Duron board, nor on this P4 board with the very
same kernel source.
While my single purchases make no difference in the scheme of things,
the lack of support from the various manufacturers given to the kernel
developers  (I refer in this case to Ross Dickson trying to get help
from Nvidia and another, I think AMD) is turning me away (back to Intel
CPUs).
Of course, I am very happy to finally see a response from someone from
Nvidia now.
With best regards
