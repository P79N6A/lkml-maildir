I'm guessing here, but it may provide a quick fix.
On older versions of the kernel, there was a known problem when physical
memory approached 1G, which was the putative maximum amount of memory
supported.  It is possible that this problem persists, in that a "4G" kernel
might run into problems somewhere before 4G.  If your kernel is not
configured to support PAE, switching to PAE may solve the problem.
Another way to solve the problem might be to construct your own memory map &
feed it to the command line, lopping off some space at the top.
