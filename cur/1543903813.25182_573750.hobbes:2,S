Sorry for spamming the list again but some people may find this useful:
[Dangling pointers are security vulnerability]
http://it.slashdot.org/it/07/07/23/1624203.shtml
Excerpt:
***
Dangling pointers are quite common, but security experts and developers have said for years that
there is no practical way to exploit them, so they've been considered quality-assurance problems
and not security flaws.
But now that has changed.
"The problem before was, you had to override the exact location that the pointer was pointing to.
It was considered impossible. But we discovered a way to do this with generic dangling pointers
and run our own shell code."
