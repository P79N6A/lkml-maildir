Don't remember. It was pointed out, probably last December (that's the
date on my directory) when I first complained about ping.
Usually (too usually) when I say something doesn't work, somebody
replies with "your tools are no good anymore" -- sometimes with
a suggestion as to where to get new ones. The machines I have at
work don't use "standard distributions". I get whatever someone
tells me to get off the net.
Cheers,
