My (girl)friend mainly use her Linux to hearing MP3s and creating web pages
using X editors, gimp and netscape. She told me that her mp3 player
almost never break but with 2.2.0 (and 2.2.1) it's much more usual.
It was interesting as well to see a kernel panic. She could only use
alt-sysreq-s, and playing mp3 can be heard only while kernel syncing ...
Strange.
Also there must be some bug in CDROM driver since she's playing MP3s
from CDs, and many kernel opps were occured mainly after chainging CDs.
