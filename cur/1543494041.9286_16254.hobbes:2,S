Nope, this is quite normal from many UDMA disks and Linux . Try forcing
the disk into PIO mode 3. See if the errors go away.
I have two systems, different drives, different controllers, different
motherboards report this error until I forced the drives into PIO Mode 3
(one is a Seagate, one is a Maxtor). It is a funky Linux driver problem or
a funky drive problem that other operating systems ignore and Linux is
hypersensative to.
