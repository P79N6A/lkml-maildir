In case anyone else makes the same mistake I did. If you are using the
same config from a previous build, you may have RCU_TORTURE_TEST=Y (not
module) and not even know it when running RT patches. You will however
definitely notice it if you use the config to build a non RT kernel like
2.6.15-rc1. The previous RT patch defaulted RCU_TORTURE_TEST=y. By the
way, the fact that I didn't even notice that the torture test was
running with the RT kernel is a true measure of how well things have
progressed. :-)
