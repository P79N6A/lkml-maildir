Oliver, 
Let me state that with a proper mixing function you should always 
mix in possible entropy sources, even if they CAN be controlled
from the outside. 
If you mistrust the source, feel free to add (almost) zero to the 
"proven entropy". 
Now, how about keeping both a conservative and a bit more liberal
count of the entropy in the pool? Then we can have three device
nodes, which provide random entropy. One should follow YOUR rules, 
and can only be used on desktop machines with humans typing and
mousing at the console (that's your proposition for "random"). 
The other is useful for random numbers for keys and such (that's 
our current "random"). The last is our old urandom.
