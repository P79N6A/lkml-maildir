One thing I noticed last night with 2.5.56 and this may be unique to my
system.  I did a mostly default "make config" (changing only network,
usb, and sound settings from the default).  
What I noticed is that on shutdown, when it said "Power off" or whatever
it says when you "init 0", if I pressed my power button, it did not
immediately power down the computer.  I had to do the old "hold in the
power button for six seconds" trick for the power to shut off.
This was not the csae in the 2.4.20 kernels.
Maybe I need to tweek ACPI settings??  
By the way, noticed that I had to select Pentium 3 on the processor type
menu now as if I was using an antiquated system (Which I guess I am). 
The default kernel processor type was set to pentium 4.  Does this mean
future distros from vendors are likely to require a pentium 4 to run
since that's the default?
