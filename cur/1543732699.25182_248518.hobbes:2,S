Well, dnotify() really _is_ inotify(), since it does actually work on 
inodes, not dentries.
I think what they are really complaining about is that dnotify() only 
notifies the _directory_ when a file is changed, and they'd like it to 
notify the file itself too. Which is a one-liner, really.
Does the following make sense? (Totally untested, use-at-your-own-risk, 
I've-never-actually-used-dnotify-in-user-space, whatever).
