One of the issues I am addressing is how to deal w/ VDMA or PIO over
PCI-DMA or FP-DMA issues.  First Party DMA is how things will get done,
and regardless there will still be an need for PIO.
As long as ther transport layer requires it regardless of the wrapper or
pipe it is run down, it shall be around.
