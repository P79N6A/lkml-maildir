Hi,
  I am working on the IDENT protocol. Could anybody tell me whether the 
identd.conf file is different in linux and solaris. I have never used solaris 
before. So I do not know if the identd file is different. If different, could 
anyone send me a copy of identd.conf of solaris. I have got a copy of linux 
identd.conf.
  Thanks in advance, thanks a lot.
