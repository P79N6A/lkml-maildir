And I have to accept that you think, that the code belongs there ?

In order to satisfy your idea of abstraction, you add glue code to make
it work:
clocksource.c:

Abstractions are good in general, but this is artificial for no benefit.
You claim, that you optmize update_wll_time()

Well, I guess I have some perceptional disturbance. What exactly is the
optimization ? Pushing clock_override_name into that code path ? As I
said before, the performance difference of change_clocksource() and
atomic_read() is not big enough to justify the mess you create all over
the place.
The whole notifier business is not necessary, if you keep the
clocksource related code in one place. 
You break sched_clock on x86 for no good reason.
