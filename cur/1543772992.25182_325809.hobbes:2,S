No, trust me, the *first* read/write to a device which is returning
errors is returning EIO.  But it might not be the application which
you are testing.  It might be an attempt to update the inode last
access time that fails, so it might not even be returned to user space
at all.    
But once the filesystem is remounted read-only the reason why EROFS is
being returned is not because of an I/O error, but because the
filesystem is now read-only.  It makes perfect sense, if you think
like a computer....

That's because right now there is no way for block devices to inform
the filesystem that device is totally gone.

Because remounting a filesystem means toggling the in-core data
structures that writes are no longer being tolerated.  It doesn't
require reading from the device, which a fresh mount requires.

The problem is the filesystem right now can't tell the difference
between type 1 and type 2 errors.  All we know is that an attempt to
read or write from a block as failed.  We don't know why it failed.   
I agree that *if* the filesystem could be told that a block device has
disappeared, then we should do the equivalent of umount -l on the
filesystem, and revoke all open file descriptors, much like the BSD
revoke(2) system call.  
But this isn't matter of "standardizing" error returns, but rather a
feature/enhancement request.
