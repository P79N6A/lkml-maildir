Yes, I meant cpus_allowed is empty

True.

And those processes (kernel threads) will continue to run on their cpus

You are forgetting the fact that the scheduler is still load balancing
across all CPUs and tries to pull tasks only to find that the task's
cpus_allowed mask prevents it from being moved

I am working on a minimalistic design right now and will get back in
a day or two
