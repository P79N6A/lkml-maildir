No, he made it rather clear, that as far as possible he only wants dynamic 
annotations (e.g. via function attributes).

I don't deny that dynamic tracer are more flexible, but I simply don't 
have the resources to implement one. If those who demand I use a dynamic 
tracer, would also provide the appropriate funding, it would change the 
situation completely, but without that I have to live with the tools 
available to me.
