The duplication is a reasonable starting point for SCSI-specific functions.
The block i/o design provides for exactly this type of tailoring through
function pointers installed in request_queue.
What problem you do see with exporting block internals?

I will investigate the above comments further.

Do you think the separation of SCSI from generic block i/o code and the
driver-activated control of concurrent queueing provides a path for future 
work to reduce io_request_lock contention in SCSI/FC?
