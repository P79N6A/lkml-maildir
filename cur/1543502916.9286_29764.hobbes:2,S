Hello, all.
Recently found time to upgrade to Redhat's 2.2.5-15 kernel; it works
fine.  Got the corresponding source RPM and tried to compile my own --
compile went fine.  Problem is, booting with the new kernel puts me in
a SCSI loop. Whereas the stock kernel gives something like this on
boot:
scsi0: blah blah
scsi0: blah blah
scsi0: blah blah
scsi1: more stuff
scsi1: more stuff
scsi1: more stuff
which is correct (aha3940 dual-channel controller), the kernel I
compiled does this:
scsi0: blah blah
scsi0: blah blah
scsi0: blah blah
scsi bus timeout
[repeat]
In other words, it never sees scsi1.  I didn't change the SCSI setup
between the two kernels.  The only thing I can think of is that I
added a sound card (ISA).  I'm not sure which SCSI options Redhat
picked for the aic7xxx driver, but I compiled it into the kernel (Y),
left TCQ at 8, upped the reset timeout to 15 seconds (so I could read
the above messages), and said (N) to the extra debugging info.
My first thought was that the aic7xxx driver was buggy in 2.2.5; the
other possibility that I can come with is that the sound card is
stealing the controller's 2nd IRQ.  The thing with that is that the
stock kernel boots just fine.
Should I just get a later 2.2 kernel?
If the precise error messages would be helpful, let me know, and
I'll write them down when I get home.
Thanks for any ideas :)
