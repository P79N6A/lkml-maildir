If it didn't matter in the object code, it would be just documentation.
But uninitialized variables are put into the .bss segment, which is not
included in the object (and is assumed to be zero on start), while
initialized ones (even to zero) are put into the .data segment, which
*is* in the object file.
Thus a difference of 12 bytes code size in your case (on a 32 bit system).
