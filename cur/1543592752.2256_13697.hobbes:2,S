I noticed the Win32 benchmark/test application Sandra mentioned an SMBus
problem with the A7A266 as well.  I have yet to try lm_sensors myself,
but it looks like I won't get far.

I get the same message, but it does not appear to dramatically affect
my performance.  As I mentioned, I am getting 25MB/s (through hdparm; I
have yet to try anything more) with my Quantum Fireball.  My DMA is
enabled in the BIOS and detected by the kernel.

Do you have the PnP operating system setting in the BIOS turned off?
(ie. telling the BIOS you have non-PnP aware O/S)  I noticed that prior
to doing this, all of my PCI cards were listed as IRo 0.
