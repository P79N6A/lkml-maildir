so which (in this case) graphic card should we buy? i bought my nvidia card, 
because i knew that nvidia hands out linux drivers, even if they are binary 
only, but i knew that they do, so i didn't want to buy another card and 
realize afterwards that it absolutely isn't supported under linux.
regards,
dominik
