Hi!
Someone on the hungarian linux-hw mailing list
asked that he got an Umax Astra-1220S scanner
and a bundled SCSI card.
There is one chip on the card with this label:
DOMEX
436P
9819
002-D436P-001
and this is written on the card:
UDS-IS11 PC/ISA
P/N:970160-18
Do someone know whether Linux supports this one?
If yes, which driver?
