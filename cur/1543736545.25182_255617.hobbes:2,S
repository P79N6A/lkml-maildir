Thank you for commemts.
You are right. If the linux IRQ number is allocated by MSI code,
clearing 'dev->irq' would cause a problem. So we need to consider
clearing 'dev->irq' carefully.
The latest patch doesn't clear 'dev->irq' so far.

I'm not quite sure what you are saying, but my idea is defining
acpi_unregister_gsi() as a opposite part of acpi_register_gsi().
Acpi_register_gsi() is defined for each arch (i386, ia64), so
acpi_unregister_gsi() is defined for each i386 and ia64 too. 
Thanks,
