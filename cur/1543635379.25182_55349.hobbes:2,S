True.  But someone is going to write a checker at some point.  It's only a couple days work if you know what you are doing.  There doesn't seem to be much advantage in waiting a year or two.

If someone made a mistake where they always returned under a kernel_lock() they would find the mistake themselves.  
Why would they return under kernel_lock() on error, for example, but not on success?  That would be confusing.  There would still be some false positives but the number of cases is really small.
