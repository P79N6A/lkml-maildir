Subject: [PATCH] perform maintenance on Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch makes the following updates to
Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt: 
- there's no need to select HUGETLB_PAGE manually and it's no longer
under the processor menu. Update the text accordingly.
- fix typos and trim trailing whitespace.
Please apply...
