Hi,
I've been playing with the capabilities stuff in the 2.2.1 kernel, but
can't seem to find any mention of it anywhere on the web.  Who is
maintaining this code, and where can I find information on
status/plans/progress?
I'm interested in working on the kernel end of the capabilities if any
more work is needed, and implementing the user level end of things.
I'd like:
- the security policy/roadmap/plans for the work that has been started
- any other work that has been done
- access to the posix.6 specs (if anyone has them)
I'm also interested in knowing the status on ACL support.  Is support
being worked on?  Can it be added to ext2, or is something new needed?
Any pointers to this?
