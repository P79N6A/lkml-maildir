It looks like a normal looping spinlock with rep nop and cmpxchg on i386. 
Not that I understand IA64 assembler --- but look at 
ia64_spinlock_contention --- it looks like a loop with pause and nonatomic 
test and a branch to acquire spinlock atomically with cmpxchg --- nothing 
that would prevent starving there.

That is right, that you should avoid contention --- but the kernel should 
be stable no matter what userspace programs you run. Or does it mean that 
scientists can run only trusted programs on Altix that do not perform too 
many certain syscalls concurently in order to not jam spinlocks?
