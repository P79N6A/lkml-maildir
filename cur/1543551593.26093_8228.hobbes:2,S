Yes, that's what you want to end up with. My box originally had 0x50 == 0x88,
running the script changes this into 0x50 == 0x80. Which shell did you use when
you tried the script? It is probably bash-only...

When you're done with this system, try an abit BP6 SMP-board. Loads of crashing
fun and horror... That's what I'm on currently (the Triton sits below the last
step of the staircase in the role of server and mp3-player)
