| Hi, here is a series of patches in hope to bring
| net-namespace functionality for PPP, PPPoE, PPPoL2TP
| protocols.
| 
| I've tested plain PPP virtualization and it worked
| for me. Quite may thanks to James Chapman who
| was testing PPPoL2TP for me, thanks a lot again
| James!
| 
| Please review and test if possible. I do really
| appreciate _any_ kind of feedback. Thanks!
| 
| I didn't put Ack I got on previous series since it's
| a bit new (though PPPoE didn't changed but anyway)
| 
| The patches are on top of net-2.6 commit
| 
| commit f4895b8bc83a22a36446c4aee277e1750fcc6a18
