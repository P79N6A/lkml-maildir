    Pardon me if this report is alittle messy but I would try to
describe more precisely.
1. Finally get pre2-3 to work happily with shm.
2. Upgrade to pre2-4 and reboot with no problems.
3. upon a shutdown on the computer ;
	a. mysql shutdown with errors
	b. postgres shutdown with errors
	c. computer freeze next to httpd shutdown.
4. Hard reboot it up again.
5. This time , it causes x-application to freeze ( tkdesk ).
	a. a ctrl + alt + bkspace terminate the x window
	b. x window refuse to restart after this 
6. Freeze on shutdown again.
FYI, I'm running with all the minimum requirement as the documentation
stated.
hope this help
