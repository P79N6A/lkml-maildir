Many people have sent me mail saying that we should be using traffic
shaping to fix this problem.  We are using it and we can't seem to make
it work.  Our theory is that we have a network like
 ----- [ ISP ] ====== internet ======== [ ISP ] ----
wherein "-" means our skinny T1 or DSL and "=" means some fat internet 
connection on the backbone.  
We can shape all we want on our ends but if the internet is blasting us
then our skinny pipe gets full and our shaping doesn't work.  We really
need to have the ISP do the shaping so they can squelch the traffic 
before it gets to our pipe.
If there is someone out there who (a) is running VOIP over the public net
to a pile of different end points (T1 on both ends tends to work, T1 to DSL
or cable modem tends to get harder) and (b) has figured out traffic shaping
that works I'd love to know about it.  
But just saying QoS/wondershaper doesn't help much (though the thought is
appreciated), we've tried that already.
Thanks.
