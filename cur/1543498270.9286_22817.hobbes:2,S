	In todays times i'm getting more and more into trouble working with
files because the easily tend to grow beyond the 2gb size. Mostly its some
database files or similar things. I've unsuccessfully search for patches to
the size limit for ext2. Which other fs is recommended to use for such large
files ?
sincerly,
	Markus
