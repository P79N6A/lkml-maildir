It is not the preferred form for editing the source code,
so it is not the real source code as defined by the GPL.
    However, this begs another question: the kernel source is GPL'd.  But
    is the _repository_ at bkbits.net GPL'd?
I believe the contents are all under the GPL.
					      And if so, do I have the
    right to demand a copy of the whole repository whenever I receive a
    binary kernel, or is that right restricted to the checked out files
    used to compile that kernel?
Whoever distributes a binary kernel to you has the obligation to 
offer you the complete source code corresponding to the binary.
Source code not used in producing that binary need not be
included.
