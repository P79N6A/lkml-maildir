I would personally like it a lot to have timer events available on
pollable fds. Am I alone in this ?

About that, I think we should make an utility function to be shared among
all the code that need to create "fake" inodes to expose fds. Right now
many component ( pipes, futexes, epoll, ... ) uses the basic code, sharing
the same needs, and duplicating basically the same code.
