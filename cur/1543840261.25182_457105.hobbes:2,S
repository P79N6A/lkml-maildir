All you need is
struct wombat_controller
{
	struct user_beancounter counter;
	void (*wombat_pest_control)(struct wombat *w);
	atomic_t wombat_population;
	int (*wombat_destructor)(struct wombat *w);
};
and just embed the counter in whatever you are controlling. The point of
the beancounters themselves is to be *SIMPLE*. It's unfortunate that
some folk seem obsessed with extending them for a million theoretical
projects rather than getting them in and working and then extending them
for real projects. Please lets not have another EVMS.
