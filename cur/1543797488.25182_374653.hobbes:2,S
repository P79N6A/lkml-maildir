    Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit environment.  The 32-bit 
    environment sets int, long and pointer to 32
    bits and generates code that runs on any i386 system.  The 
    64-bit environment sets int to 32 bits and long
    and pointer to 64 bits and generates code for AMD's x86-64 
    architecture.
