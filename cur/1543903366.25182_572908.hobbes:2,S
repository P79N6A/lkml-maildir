If I remember correctly (and that's a big if since I last looked at it
in 2001) some revisions of the Dreamcast hardware would sporadically
lock up if you scheduled a new DMA request to quickly after a previous
one, even if you checked the ready bit. It's worked around by a delay
of X microseconds as recommended by Sega engineers. I don't remember
the value of X, nor where exactly in the flow this workaround should
be applied.
Adding Marcus in case he has a better memory than me.
