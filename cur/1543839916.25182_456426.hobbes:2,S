How did you transfer everything to root? By cat'ing each task pid
(including init's) to root (or mikeg) task's file?
I will give your experiment a try here and find out what's happening.
You said that you spawn a task which munches ~80% cpu. Is that by
something like:
do {
	gettimeofday(&t1, NULL);
loop:
	gettimeofday(&t2, NULL);
	while (t2.tv_sec - t1.tv_sec != 48)
		goto loop;
	sleep 12
} while (1);

Ok. I will repeat your experiment and see what I can learn from it.
