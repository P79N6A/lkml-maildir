	No, but it offers a potential but of somebody else's using it, making
hard to diagnose. I've noticed a problem some time ago with a driver
using a bad ID, that was not properly handled by i2c probing routines.

	As you and Greg pointed me before more than once, internal kernel
interfaces are subject to change from release to release. If so, what's
the problem of just changing one name? I'll prepare a patch renaming it
to a better name as you suggested me in priv (I2C_DRIVERID_INFRARED),
but anyway, it is just better to have a not-so-good name than using the
experimental one (I2C_DRIVERID_EXP3).

	As you said, neglectable damage in this case. And, in fact, this is
really a trivial patch. If we had some damage, somebody may point or
send another patch to fix. We are very close to 2.6.15, and we shouldn't
stop bug fixing because of minor details.

	Agreed! you have my support on it! during this kernel cycle, both you
and me found at V4L lots of experimental (and its own i2c_id.h file)
that we did removed from kernel. Having experimeental IDs
(and non-official codes) only generates mess and may be a source of hard
to diagnose bugs.
