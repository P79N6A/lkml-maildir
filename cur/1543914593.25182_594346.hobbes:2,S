What does your mtrr look like?  How about dmesg?  Might be the stupid
mtrr setup some bioses have been doing on intel chips where it would do:
4GB range at 4GB
1GB range at 8GB
512MB range at 9GB
256MB range at 9.5GB
etc.
And then it runs out of entries (which pisses of X).
The simple solution would have been to assign an 8GB range at 4GB or
maybe a 4GB range at 4GB and a 2GB range at 8GB to cover all the ram.
Without the mtrr coverage you get no caching of that memory which makes
use that that section of memory slow.  To make the system useable there
is code in the kernel to discard any memory the BIOS didn't correctly
cover with an mtrr cachable entry.
