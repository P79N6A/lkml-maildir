As I pointed out in 
http://lists.arm.linux.org.uk/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2006-November/037192.html
the console gets flooded with this "warning" to unusable state sometimes.

I don't know exactly. But in addition to the fact, that this warning
floods my console to unusable state I am used to sell software without
warnings. If there are warnings my boss some things are broken.
