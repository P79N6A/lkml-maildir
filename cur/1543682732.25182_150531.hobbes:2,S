	Yes, syslog can handle this, but in order to parse syslog files
you should have your LC_CTYPE set to something Latin-1 compatible
(which UTF-8 is not, and it is the default on many distros).
	Why Latin-1 and not UTF-8? I think UTF-8 is more "correct", while
ASCII is "works for all". Latin-1 is neither "correct" nor "works for all".
	Thanks,
