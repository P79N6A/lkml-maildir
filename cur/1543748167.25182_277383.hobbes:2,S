In general, this is true. However, there's a case where it's not. During
the initial filesystem mount, the .reiserfs_priv directory is created by
reiserfs_xattr_init(). This directory becomes the root of the private
inode tree, but there is no way to mark it as private until after mkdir
returns. After it returns, d_instantiate has already been called.
Therefore, on the first read-write mount, the inode associated with
.reiserfs_priv will always be on that list. There are a few methods that
could be added to set the inode private before the d_instantiate, but
they're all pretty gross. Basically, of all the potential solutions,
checking IS_PRIVATE in that loop is the simplest.
