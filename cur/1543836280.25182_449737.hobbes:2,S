NAK
Two reasons
#1 Users should not be expected to set these kind of parameters, the
kernel should just get it right
#2 With the new buffering if you respond too slowly then thats allowed
for (with a limit enforced in the patch I posted)
Those two alone aren't quite enough to deal with some corner cases where
you throttle too late and queue an oversized buffer. The changes in
2.6.18-rc by Paul however ensure that such a buffer is fed into the
ldisc in appropriate sized chunks to avoid data loss.
