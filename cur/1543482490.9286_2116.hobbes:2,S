Hi Tom,
That is strange.  module.h used to require the user to #include
config.h first, but now it just includes config.h itself.
So it's not a problem with including config.h.
That error is actually symptomatic of a broken autoconf.h file
that doesn't properly define AUTOCONF_INCLUDED.
What are you using to configure your kernel?  Can you e-mail
me privately your .config and include/linux/autoconf.h files?
