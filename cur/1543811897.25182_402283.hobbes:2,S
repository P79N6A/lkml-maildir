Right.  On the Altix, the mmiowb ensures that the write is into a
FIFO on the destination node (node I/O device is attached to), so
that later writes from other nodes will be ordered after it.  But
it doesn't actually force it to the bus.  That's one reason why it's
so much quicker than a using a read for ordering.
