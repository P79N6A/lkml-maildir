Modems have had horrifically crappy interfaces for years, and "software" modems
are the first step to fixing that.  Having an in-band control interface is just
junk, and should be killed ASAP.  Doing all the modulation in software is a
little heavy, but many "software" modems do that in a DSP (eg, Lucent), and fake
the AT command interface in software (like the Linux ISDN drivers do now). 
The big problem with winmodems is that they don't have Linux drivers.  Apart
from that, I don't understand why people hate them so much.
OK, sorry, off-topic.  I'll stop now.
