Subject: Printer and Zip drive don't work together.

The zip drive works regardless of the presence of the printer.  To use
the printer, I have to unplug the Zip drive and plug in the printer to
lpt.  Everything is compiled into the kernel, parport, parallel
printer/PC-hardware, etc.  
Kernel is 2.2.9, and 2.2.8.  Zip is ppa Zip, not one of the new ones. 
Everything *works*, just the pass through doesn't work. The printer
works if I plug directly to the port. Should I look to hardware
problems, or is it possible that something is wrong in the kernel, my
configuration thereof or other?
