All three patches were hopelessly mangled by your email client:
70 out of 70 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file drivers/scsi/osst.c.rej
osst-style-changes does not apply
Please sort out your email client and send the patches to yourself to test
that they still apply.
When resending please ensure that the patch headers are in `-p1' form:
--- osst-patches/osst.h	2005-01-01 19:15:32.700230984 -0500
+++ /home/wriede/SfOsstCVS/Driver26/osst.h	2005-01-01 16:13:35.000000000 -0500
Things like the above will not apply to anyone's tree without jumping
through hoops.
Also, please don't send multiple patches under the same Subject:.

 thanks.
