I haven't looked closely, but when I provoked the oom killer last week
a few times while working on something else, I did notice that the
printk's that came out were a page or two, per kill.  Apparently it
is the arch-specific show_mem() routine that was so verbose - this
was on an ia64 SN2.
Do we really need that lengthy an oom printk?  If the other arch's
tend to be a little more terse, then I guess you could catalog my
complaint as a "personal problem" or at least an "arch problem."
In support of this ratelimiting, the other call from main line kernel
code to show_mem(), after the __alloc_pages() message:
	 page allocation failure. order:%d, mode:0x%x
is already ratelimited.  Seems like a good idea.
