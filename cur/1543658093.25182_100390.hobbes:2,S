I disagree. The pmac braindamage is a pmac problem, and not worth 
uglifying the generic device layer over. Besides, as far as I know, it is 
trivially solved by just making the pmac irq controller be a root 
controller, and that's it. There are no other irq controllers there that 
are worth worrying about.
