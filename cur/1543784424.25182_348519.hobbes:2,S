I don't think so. First, the i386 patch also adds the same (as I
indicated), and second this controls also the
-fasynchronous-exception-tables compiler flag, which should be
generically available on all architectures (the i386 patch adds this to
the top level makefile, x86-64 is somewhat special in requiring the
-fno- form to be used in the opposite case, which is why this ends up in
the arch-specific makefile).
