If you set the bit ranges in asm/sparsemem.h properly, as I
have currently on sparc64, it isn't bad at all.  It's a
single extra dereference from a table that sits in the main
kernel image and thus is in a locked TLB entry.
SPARSEMEM_EXTREME is pretty much unnecessary and with the
virtual mem-map stuff the sparsemem overhead goes away entirely
and we're back to "page - mem_map" type simple calculations
obviating any dereferencing advantage from page->virtual.

All these little things add up, let's not suck like some other
OSs by having that kind of mentality.
Show me instead a change that makes page struct 8 bytes smaller
