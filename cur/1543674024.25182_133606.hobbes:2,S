Yeah, don't use void * if you can ever help it.  As there will be two
different versions for two different kernels, just don't have that
paramater, or make it a char * like you have now for 2.4.  That seems to
make sense for 2.4 where you don't have a struct device.

Ah, that makes more sense now.  Ok, I have no problem with it.

If you want to delete it later, you have to have some way to find it
again.  If you are just adding it and then removing it in the same
function, just allocate it dynamically, register it, sleep, and then
free it.  So then you would not need a list.
