I did say I had a VIVT cache.  With such a cache, the *only* place where
you can read data written via one mapping is via that very same mapping.
There is no other virtual address which will give you coherent access to
the data in another mapping.
The majority of ARMs to date have been VIVT, and the majority of Linux
kernels have worked fine (albiet the "recent" breakage of PIO block IO.)
I'm now in the situation where I come back to look at the MM code and,
to put it quite frankly, I can't see any possible way for ARM to work
with this code.  In practice, however, it does appear to work.  I just
can't see _why_ it's working.
Hence why I'm declaring the "I don't understand" flag and refraining to
endorse the patch - I _can't_ endorse what I don't understand.
