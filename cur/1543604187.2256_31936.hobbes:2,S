I'm very pleased so far with ac10 with the preempt patch.  Much better than 
2.4.9-ac18-preempt, which is what i was using.  I'm just going to put up some 
output from lmbench to see if anyone who is running the non-preempt version 
is seeing better or worse timings and scores.   Perhaps the improvement is 
all in my head due to me moving my atapi devices off of the promise card 
(since you're not supposed to put any on it) and now everything is generally 
running faster despite the kernel being used.  Heh.  so here they are

That's all from lmbench2.  Anyone without the preempt patch using the same 
kernel care to compare? I'm very pleased.  
Heavily io bound processes (dbench 32)  still causes something as light as an 
mp3 player to skip, though.   That probably wont be fixed intil 2.5, since 
you need to have preemption in the vm and the rest of the kernel.
