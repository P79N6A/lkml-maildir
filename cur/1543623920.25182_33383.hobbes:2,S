I was chatting with the GDB folks, and they mentioned there is no code in
the kernel which
will dump *all* thread registers to a core file.  Anyone have such code that
could be used in a patch?
Being able to get at the state of all threads in a process at core-dump time
is invaluable!
Anyone else been griping about this?
Rah!
