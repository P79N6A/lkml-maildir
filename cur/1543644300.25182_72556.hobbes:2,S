Bill,
would you please check the boot messages for the NUMA scheduler before
doing the run. Martin sent me an example where he has:
CPU pools : 1
pool 0 :0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 
node level 0 : 10
pool_delay matrix:
 129 
which is clearly wrong. In that case we need to fix the cpu-pools setup
first.
Regards,
Erich
