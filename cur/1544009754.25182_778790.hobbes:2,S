This does fix the symmetry by using the same interfaces on both sides,
so it seems reasonable to me. However, since do_gettimeofday reads the
clocksource hardware, this may have a slight performance impact to
time() users.
I know privately I said this patch looked fine earlier, so sorry for the
mixed messages, but I really think we should be able to use
get_seconds() without this problem.
Looking more carefully at the code in do_settimeofday(), we should
accumulate the left over cycles, then we set the current time to the
specified time and update the xtime_cache.
So I'm not sure if we're really fixing the right issue here. Further,
running on the x86_64 system, I don't see this issue crop up at all (for
either 64 or 32 bit binaries). I think you mentioned privately that this
was seen on i386, so maybe we need to dig just a bit deeper before going
with this fix.
And sorry again for running hot then cold on this patch. I just didn't
look deeply enough at the issue the first time around. :(
thanks
