Hi Alan,
	Your assertion is correct.  I haven't studied the driver core, so I
might be off-base here, but you'll note that if the module references
the core kmalloc'ed object rather than the other way around it can be
done safely.  The core can also reference the module, but it must be
able to live without it once it's gone (eg. by returning -ENOENT).
A really poor example is below:
int register_foo(struct foo *foo)
{
	struct registered_foo *r = kmalloc(...);
	if (!r)
		return -ENOMEM;
	r->foo = foo;
	atomic_set(&r->refcnt, 1);
	spin_lock(&foo_lock);
	list_add(&foos, &r->list);
	spin_unlock(&foo_lock);
	return 0;
}
void unregister_foo(struct foo *foo)
{
	struct registered_foo *i, *found = NULL;
	spin_lock(&foo_lock);
	list_for_each_entry(i, &foos, list) {
		if (i->foo == foo) {
			i->foo = NULL;
			if (atomic_dec_and_test(&i->refcnt))
				kfree(i);
			break;
		}
	}
	spin_unlock(&foo_lock);
}
int get_foo_value(struct registered_foo *r)
{
	u32 val = -ENOENT;
	spin_lock(&foo_lock);
	if (r->foo)
		val = r->foo->val;
	spin_unlock(&foo_lock);
	return val;
}

That's actually fine, it's when packets linger in the system holding
references to the interface they came from that things get tricky.
Hence the networking code tries not to do that.
Cheers,
