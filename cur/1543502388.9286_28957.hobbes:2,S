On Intel CPUs, they don't generate any memory ordering instructions, but they
do tell the compiler that tricky things are going on, and it had better be
careful about how it reorders things.  On non-Intel systems, where the CPU can
reorder memory accesses, they may also generate instructions to explicitly tell
the CPU about what reordering is allowed.
Generally misordering accesses will just produce bad results, but when you're
dealing with reads and writes to memory mapped hardware, pretty much anything
can happen if you do something it doesn't expect.
