[PATCH] I2C: new i2c video decoder calls
Attached patch adds three new calls to the i2c video decoder API.  The changes
were requested by Michael (CC'ed) and approved by Gerd Knorr (v4l maintainer,
CC'ed).
Short explanation:
* INIT is a general initialization call with optional initialization data.
  Reason for this is that several i2c decoders (or general: clients) are being
  used by several adapters (main drivers), and in some cases, one adapter
  simply needs different settings than the other, either because the adapter
  is completely different or because the card was reverse engineered in a way
  that doesn't allow multiple adapters to run using the same original
  initialization data.  Michael faces such a problem right now.  Both he and
  me lack time to properly sit together and work out the exact details or a
  proper way to merge.
* VBI_BYPASS and GPIO set specific pins on the decoder.  This will be used
  in the saa7111 driver.  My driver (zr36067, original user of the saa7111
  driver) doesn't use any of this, but Michael's does.
