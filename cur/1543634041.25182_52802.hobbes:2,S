I have two questions about dynamic timer in Linux:
1. Kernel space: After add_timer is used, where is the
code used to poll the global 'struct timer_list' to
activate the related functions on time? It's not in
sched.c, is it in tasklet/bh?
2. User space: is there a way to set a dynamic timer
in userspace as well, such as create_timer(posix, not
in Linux)? 
TIA
