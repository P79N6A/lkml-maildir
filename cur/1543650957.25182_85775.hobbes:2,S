Give my console diff a try.
http://phoenix.infradead.org/~jsimmons/console.diff.gz
Its against 2.5.45. It has 3 bugs I know of.
1) Switch back to X messes up the screen.
2) I had to disable the beeper. I have to think of a proper solution to
   that problem with Vojtech.
3) Software suspend is broken because the console has moved from the
   global int currcons to private struct vc_data to represent a VC.
   BTW what was the author of that code trying to do any ways?
