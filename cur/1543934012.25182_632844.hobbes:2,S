--> A warning message is OK, but dropping the drive from the array is
excessive IMHO. And anyway, this should be user-configurable, so that it
becomes each user's responsibility to choose if the drive shall be dropped
or not. Currently we don't have any choice.

--> I'll check that out. Does someone know about how this "safe mode delay"
works ?

--> All RAID edition drives are more expensive that their equivalent
"desktop edition" drives (same model on "desktop edition"). Just take a look
at newegg for instance. Besides, trying to find an affordable "RAID edition"
model is not a solution to this technical timeout issue, just a workaraound
(a bad one IMHO). Thanks anyway.
