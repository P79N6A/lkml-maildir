Have you looked at the rt_rcu patch ? Where do you think there
is overhead compared to what route cache alread does ? In my
profiles, rcu routines and kernel mechanisms that it uses
don't show high up. If you have any suggestions, then I can
do an investigation.

I agree that it is better to keep things simple and RCU isn't a
replacement for locking. However the route cache hash table with
refcount is a relatively simpler use of RCU and since it has
benefits, we shouldn't shy away from using it if it is useful.
Thanks
