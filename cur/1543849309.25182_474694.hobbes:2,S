	It's the same bug as before.
	The user is *not* using 2.6.19-rc2-mm1, but 2.6.19-rc2 :
---------------------------------------------------
Linux version 2.6.19-rc2 (root@orion) (gcc version 4.1.1 (Gentoo 4.1.1)) #3 PREEMPT Thu Oct 19 16:04:17 CEST 2006
---------------------------------------------------
	The Orinoco fix is in 2.6.19-rc2-mm1, but it is *not* in
2.6.19-rc2.
	John : the current code is 2.6.19-rc2 is definitely not
releasable. Either we back out WE-21, or we fix it, but doing nothing
at this point is a receipe for disaster.
	I submitted to you 3 patches to fix WE-21 in 2.6.19-rc2 :
		o Orinoco SLAB fix
		o Other driver slab fix
		o WE-20 ESSID backward compatibility
	Those patches were fixing real problems and tested on my side.
	If those patches are not planned to go in 2.6.19-rc2, I ask
again that WE-21 be removed from 2.6.19.
	Thanks in advance...
	Jean
