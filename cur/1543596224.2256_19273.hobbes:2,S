As opposed to passing a cookie (struct resource) and an offset, and letting
the compiler do the addition it'd do anyway or eliminate the cookie directly
on platforms where this is suitable.

Eh? Who said anything about bus number info? Just the information in the
resource structure.
> 	You keep putting it on/off the stack
Why should I want to do that? You've got to keep the base address of your
resource space somewhere anyway, so you could just replace it with a pointer
to the resource struct (which you've already got). Plus, I can pass this in a
register to any behind the scenes function.
In my example code, in the really simple cases (most of them), there were no
pushes and pops.
> 	You keep it in structures
Doesn't everyone? Apart from those that use global variables, I suppose, but
surely they're limited in reusability.
> 	You do complex generic locking for hotplug 'just in case'
Eh? No I wasn't, but under some circumstances one might have to do that
anyway, and so the out-of-line functions may be the best place to do that.
