Hi everybody,
When reading the source, I can see in:
. alloc_skb()
139         size = ((size + 15) & ~15); 
140         data = kmalloc(size + sizeof(atomic_t), gfp_mask);
I understand the size stuff (the sk_buff content is 16-bytes aligned to be
cache-friendly I guess).
But why actually allocating size + the size of an atomic_t, which will
break this alignment?
. dev_alloc_skb() seems to allocate 16 bytes more than needed as head
room. What is the purpose of this? How can I choose which one of
alloc_skb() or dev_alloc_skb() will suit my needs?
Thanks in advance for your answers,
Best regards,
