I guess so.  Doing it on a per-cpuset+per-slab or per-cpuset+per-inode
basis would get a bit complex implementation-wise, I expect.  And a smart
application could roughly implement that itself anyway by turning spreading
on and off as it goes.
One does wonder about the buffer-head slab - it's pretty tightly bound to
pagecache..
