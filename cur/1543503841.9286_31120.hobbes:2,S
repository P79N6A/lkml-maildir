After installing Redhat 6.0 on two brand-new workstations with identical
hardware (single AMD K6-2 450, 6G HDD, 128 MB SDRAM, AOpen 100MHz AGP
ATX motherboard), they both exhibited the same problem when shutting
down the system to move them.  Repeated tests under various BIOS
settings have shown the same error.

...etc.
After restart, the filesystems are checked as if they weren't unmounted
properly.
If they are needed, I have on hand the cut information - I wasn't sure
it was necessary and wanted to save bandwidth.
If anybody can help with this, I thank you very much.
