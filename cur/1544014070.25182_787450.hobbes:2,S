which I have done. Now we're back to demux / not demux...

Think about other IPU interrupts. For now I removed the CSI interrupt, but 
it may well be needed at some point. Or any of overflow interrupts? What 
do we do then? Why shall we build in limitations from the beginning, when 
there is an implementation already there, which doesn't have them? Sorry, 
do not understand.
I know you proposed to dispatch all DMA EOF interrupts to one IRQ number 
and (optionally / as required) others to single IRQs. But I like to see 
single DMA sources as separate entries in /proc/interrupts, even if only 
for debugging.
And no, it is not thanks to Freescals code, that I'm doing that, it's more 
contrary to their code - they do not implement an irq_chip API and instead 
add an API of their own.

If we agree on the rest, I'll submit a v7 - updating mx31.h to its current 
state and fixing Kconfig / NR_IRQS.
Thanks
