Yup, it's not pretty.

Your idea makes code a bit visually longer, but I've no real objection.

Perhaps:
extern char *__EUI48_fmt(char *buf, const unsigned char *addr);
#define EUI48_FMT "%s" /* expands to: "FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF" */
#define DECLARE_EUI48(name) char name[sizeof("FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF")]
#define EUI48(name, addr) __EUI48_fmt(name, (const unsigned char *)addr)
use case:
{
	DECLARE_EUI48(eui48);
	printk("mac: " EUI48_FMT, EUI48(eui48, dev->dev_addr));
}
Here's one with an assumption of an eui48 buffer name.
extern char *__EUI48_fmt(char *buf, const unsigned char *addr);
#define EUI48_FMT "%s" /* expands to: "FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF" */
#define DECLARE_EUI48 char __eui48_buf[sizeof("FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF")]
#define EUI48(addr) __EUI48_fmt(__eui48_buf, (const unsigned char *)addr)
use case:
{
	DECLARE_EUI48;
	printk("mac: " EUI48_FMT, EUI48(dev->dev_addr));
}
Which one do you like more?
