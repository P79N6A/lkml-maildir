Well, /dev/random never was the right interface for most applications, and
this is arguably the real source of the problem.  For most applications,
what you want is something like /dev/urandom (possibly a version that
doesn't deplete all the true randomness available for /dev/random).  Very
few applications need true randomness; for most, cryptographic-quality
pseudorandomness should suffice.
1 bit of true randomness a minute should be more than sufficient for most
real applications.  (That means you can catastrophically reseed with 128
bits once every two hours, which sounds good to me.)
