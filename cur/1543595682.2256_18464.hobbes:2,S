Yup.  IIRC, he said that flushing cache at do_swap_page() (which I've
tried at first) is not good, because it's the hot path and it causes
another performance problem in apache or sendmail, where many
processes share the pages in swap cache.
Then, the fix I sent yesterday is second try.  The flush is moved to
I/O routine, instead of do_swap_page().
Actually, I really wonder why current code causes no problem in other
architectures.
