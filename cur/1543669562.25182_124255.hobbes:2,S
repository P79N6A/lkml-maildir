Subject: [BUG] settimeofday(2) succeeds for microsecond value more than USEC_PER_SEC and for negative value

Settimeofday(2) should return EINVAL in case where tv.tv_usec parameter is more than 
USEC_PER_SEC (more than 10^6 ) or for negative values of tv.tv_usec. 
It returns 0 (success) instead.
Clock_settimeofday(2) (kernel/posix-timers.c) also uses do_sys_settimeofday() and faces the
Same problem.
I think this is a bug. If you confirm, I will send a patch.
