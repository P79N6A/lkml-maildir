Eric,
Welcome to the party......
It looks like it is time to clean house on this issue.
I am in, to resolve and contribute for IDE.  You name came up before in
another discussion about SCSI I had the other day.
I suggested Linux consider the move to a default packet global block
device layer and both SCSI and IDE plug into it.
I checked with T13 and possed the question of moving all of ATA to ATAPI,
the vice chairman explained to me that the translation lay would be to
thick and involved..........I am game to prove them wrong.........
Your thoughts to merge the two major block subsystems into one...

Entirely due to historical reasons, and I agree with you - you might as
well get rid of it, as it doesn't work with modules.
There _are_ ordering issues, but none that I can imagine being
really relevant.
