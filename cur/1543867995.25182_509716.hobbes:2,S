Then the call will have to be CONFIG_X86. I hadn't realised powerpc were
also using lock_vm_area. However I suspect that the x86 issue that those
functions were written doesn't even exist on powerpc, or any other non-x86
architecture.
I guess we should change the name of alloc_vm_area, by the way. Perhaps
alloc_vm_area_sync() or similar, to give some hint of what it's doing and
how it differs from other vmalloc-area functions?
