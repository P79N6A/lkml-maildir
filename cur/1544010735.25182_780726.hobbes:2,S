Thanks for that pointer.
I didn't look at tip/x86/mce up to know. Is this .28 material?
My fix is intended for .28.
I didn't care about the lurking sysfs interface when booted with
"nomce".  It's there and you could enable MCE with changing attributes
but then you are actively fiddling with MCE.
The fix is for the more severe problem that mce_init() is called on
resume and thus will enable MCE (setup cr4 and corresponding MSRs)
which shouldn't happen when booted with "nomce".
Regards,
Andreas
