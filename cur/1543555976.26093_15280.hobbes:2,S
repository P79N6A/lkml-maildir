2.4.0-test11-ac2 still freezes starting up KDE 2.0 when patched
with reiserfs-3.6.18.
2.4.0-test12-pre2 both SMP and UP builds also freeze when starting
up KDE 2.0 on this dual cpu box. Those test12-pre2 kernels are
patched with reiserfs-3.6.19.
I guess I'll have to switch over to using Gnome if I want to continue
using kernels later than 2.4.0-test11-ac1 and ReiserFS on this dual
P-III Dell 420.
Can someone else please see if this is reproducable?  
The ingredients are:
Dual CPU P-III.
2.4.0-test11-ac2 or later (test12-pre2)
SMP build for -acX. (X > 1).
ReiserFS 3.6.18 or 3.6.19.
KDE 2.0
Thanks very much.
Steven
