Generally I never liked parsing stuff like this in the kernel (proc and
devfs both do this).  That being said, I do see the need to make subdirs
like this easier.
But what about cleanups?  If I create an attribute group "foo/baz/x/" and
then remove it, will the subdirectories get cleaned up too?  What about
if I had created a group "foo/baz/y/" after the "x" one?  Or just
"foo/baz"?
thanks,
