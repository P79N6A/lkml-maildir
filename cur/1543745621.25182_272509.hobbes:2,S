Unfortunately I am not an expert here, but wouldn't it be sufficient to
export in sysfs the information needed to distinguish between those two
saa7134-* modules, and then submit a new agent to linux-hotplug-devel? Then
hotplug will take care of loading the correct module (and hotplug is always
called asynchronously).
