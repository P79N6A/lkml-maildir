Greetings;
Since no else seems to be having a problem but me, and I refuse to 
throw out my Hauppauge tv card, which some have said would make 
sensors work, my next Q is:
Is there a utility that can scan the kernel and tell me what has 
actually been builtin?
I ask because there is no trace of the ic2_algobit in /sys, its one of 
the errors sensors reports, and it is (supposedly, thats why I ask 
this question) compiled in.  No errors were noted during any of the 
about 20 or more kernel compiles I've done trying everyones ideas 
out.
Kernel ATM is 2.6.1-rc1-mm2
Also, from a thread earlier today, I assume 2.6.1-rc2 is out, but 
ANAICT no announcement was made here on this list.  Did I miss it, 
and if so can it be reposted?  Everything that falls out of a kmail 
search has  RE: in front of it.
