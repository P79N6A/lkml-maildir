I have done exactly this, which I've used for a few device drivers.  The
Makefile can usually find the kernel source tree for the running kernel
by looking in the sensible places, it knows where to install modules,
and it is even able to get the right $(CFLAGS) from a configured kernel
tree.
The package includes a "compat.h", which rather like other similar files
("kcompat24.h") provides a 2.4-series API that works with all kernels
going back to 2.0, on all platforms I hope.  (I grepped the patches to
find out when each API change that I'm interested in occurred).  This
doesn't include network driver API though, just your basic PCI search
and read/write/ioctl/mmap/get_user interfaces.
The nice result is that, from a single source .tar.gz, "make" builds and
installs a driver module written with (more or less) the 2.4 API on any
kernel from 2.0 to 2.4, and the driver source is not full of ifdefs.
I suppose you're wondering where to get these files.  Mail me and I'll
see if there's much demand.
cheers,
