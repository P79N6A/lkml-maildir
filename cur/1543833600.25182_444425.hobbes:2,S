Hmmm.   Do you really want mprotect() itself?  Or, do you just want to
keep people from writing?  (there is a difference :)
If somebody mmap()s something with write permissions, I would expect
them to expect to see rw in /proc/<pid>/maps.  If you use mprotect() on
that mmap() to remove the write permissions, the permissions will be
reflected in /proc/<pid>/maps.
