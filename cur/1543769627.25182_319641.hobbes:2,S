Boris, I used your config files and it is working for me. I disabled kgdb 
from your first config and enabled serial console output in second config.

Second kernel did not have serial console output enabled in config file. Is
it possible to test it out once again with serial console enabled. May be
disable kgdb in first kernel.
With --console-serial option enabled while loading panic kernel (kexec -p) I 
am expecting at least following message on serial console after Sysrq-c.
"I am in purgatory".
It gives me some indicator whether purgatory code started execution or not.
Thanks
