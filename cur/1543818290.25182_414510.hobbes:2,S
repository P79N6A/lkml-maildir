Ok, so the problem seems to be that inet_init gets called after qeth_init.
Looking at the top level Makefile this seems to be true for all network
drivers in drivers/net/ and drivers/s390/net/ since we have
vmlinux-main := $(core-y) $(libs-y) $(drivers-y) $(net-y)
The patch below works for me... I guess there must be a better way to make
sure that any networking driver's initcall is made before inet_init?
