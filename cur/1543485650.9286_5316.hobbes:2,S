Hmm...I have yet to find the fsync()ing useful...I agree that it
could help log something helpful, but I don't see disabling fsync() as a
kludge, though.  Perhaps you should try remote logging and disabling
fsync() on the remote machine?  If the logging server goes down for
whatever reason, you can enable fsync() again if you want to see if you
can get a better trace of it (it could just be spat to the console
anyhow), but if any other server goes down it should be logged there.
2.2 might help a bit, but I doubt it will do anything significant.
sys_fsync() has changed, but it looks like it just adds some locking.
You might want to try a new init, as version 2.71-2 removed sync() from
the main loop (very helpful).
