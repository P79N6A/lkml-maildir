Well, putting in these two small patches (/always/ invoke send_IPI_single + this one, modified to include flags on the two spin calls), things look better after two runs (without profiling enabled), this was done on the 4-way ia64 box:

Will do a longer set of runs and report out on that. As you had noticed earlier Jens, the make results look good...
