HP/UX and some other systems, have kernel parameters that can be set for
max number of processes, and or threads.  I'm not a big fan of it myself,
since there are instances where it would appear to be a 'fork attack' but
be legitimate threads or forks.
Not to mention it is just tacky...  A better solution is:
Know thy users, .... and thy baseball bat.
