It seems that a better solution to the "how do we write to a file on an
in-use partition" has been suggested, which also handles swap partitions
and swap files, and does not require mounting filesystems, so it seems
that the filesystem issue need not be considered.

It seems that it should be feasible to fix the drivers so that
1. they can be taken from normal state to quiesced state without
   requiring the freezer;
2. they can be taken from normal state to low power state without
   requiring the freezer;
3. they can be taken from quiesced state to low power state without
   requiring the freezer.
In the particular, it seems that it should be possible to do (3) without
needing to schedule tasks.
It seems likely that (2) may in fact be almost exactly the same as, or
at least similar to, (1) followed by (3), at least for many drivers.
(1) is required by the kexec hibernate approach even ignoring suspend to
both or S4.  (2) is required for suspend to ram without the freezer,
which seems to be desired anyway.
