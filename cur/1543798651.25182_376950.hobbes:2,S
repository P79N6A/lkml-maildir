Wrong - because you haven't understood what I'm getting at.  If you're
using "cmpxchg" as the low level generic atomic operation (as in the
atomic_cmpxchg() function) then atomic_cmpxchg _has_ to be implemented
on llsc as:
	load (reserve if you need this detail)
	compare
	store conditional
So, let's illustrate this.  Let's say you want to atomically multiply
a value by N.
	do {
		old = atomic_read(&foo);
		new = old * N;
	} while(atomic_cmpxchg(&foo, old, new) != old);
For an architecture supporting cmpxchg, this becomes:
loop:	load foo => old
	new = old * N
	cmpxchg ret, old, new, foo
	compare ret & old
	if not equal goto loop
And for architectures with llsc, this becomes:
loop:	load foo => old
	new = old * N
loop2:	load locked foo => ret
	compare ret & old
	if equal store conditional new in foo
		if store failed because we lost the lock, goto loop2
	compare ret & old
	if not equal goto loop
Do you now see what I mean?  (yup, ARM is a llsc architecture.)
