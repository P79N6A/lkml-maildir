This sounds like the same sort of problems w/ the b44 driver.
I surmise that both use the same (broken) DMA engine from Broadcom.
Unfortunately, I don't know of any good solution to this.  There are
a few hacks in b44 that deal with the issue.  I don't like them,
although I am the perpetrator of at least one of them.  It might be
worth looking at what was done there?
YMMV...
