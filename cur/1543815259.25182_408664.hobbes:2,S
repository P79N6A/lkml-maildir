Sorry, but thats just silly.  Did you even look at the code
around what you're changing (it has to do more than just wrap
up slab calls)?  So, NACK on this patch - it leaves the code
very confused (half zoney, half slaby), and is just unhelpful
code churn at the end of the day.
For your zalloc patch, you will need to duplicate the logic
in kmem_zone_alloc into kmem_zone_zalloc in order to use that
new zalloc interface you're introducing - which should be fine.
cheers.
