And what's the problem with that?
You *need* this.  You have to have that multiple-completion concept in
the disk layers.  Think about chains of buffer_heads being sent to
disk as a single IO --- you need to know which buffers make it to disk
successfully and which had IO errors.
And no, the IO success is *not* necessarily sequential from the start
of the IO: if you are doing IO to raid0, for example, and the IO gets
striped across two disks, you might find that the first disk gets an
error so the start of the IO fails but the rest completes.  It's the
completion code which notifies the caller of what worked and what did
not.
And for readahead, you want to notify the caller as early as posssible
about completion for the first part of the IO, even if the device
driver is still processing the rest.
Multiple completions are a necessary feature of the current block
device interface.  Removing that would be a step backwards.
Cheers,
 Stephen
