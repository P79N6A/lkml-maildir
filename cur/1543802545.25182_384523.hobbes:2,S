Thanks. Hopefully we can also make them useful ;-)
Have finally got some time to play, and am working on a "push" 
comparison model that'll send you email pro-actively.

OK, fair enough. Can I turn them off somehow to check? it's 10% on 
NUMA-Q. The good news is that it's stayed in -mm for long time, so ...
am praying.
Is cool to have extra debug stuff. It does make it harder to check perf 
though ... if we can do runs both with and without, it'd be ideal, I 
guess. I'd like to be able to spot perf degredations before they hit 
mainline.

Will do. it does all of them.

I'd truncated all -mm info in the filtering before 2.6.14 .. am putting 
it back so we can see clearly ... done. Look again.
Seems to have gone wrong between 2.6.14-rc1-mm1 and 2.6.14-rc2-mm1 ?
See
