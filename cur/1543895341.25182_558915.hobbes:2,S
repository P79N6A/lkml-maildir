Yes please.  I'd rather not break things in this fashion: it causes a storm
of emails which I need to redirect to the appropriate maintainers who then
take an arbitrarily long time to do anything.  Meanwhile lots of testers
get impacted and this reduces the testing level of all the other thousands
of patches in there.

Well I would prefer that we merge as many fixes as poss into -mm before
merging this patch - to reduce the impact on testers.
If these fixes are "wrong" but work then that's fine.  I just keep spamming
the maintainer with the wrong-but-works patch until he wakes up and fixes
it for real.
Also, your changelog sucks:
  This updates scripts/hdrschecks.sh by grepping for asm() constructs and
  rejecting them in favor of __asm__() in exported headers.
well OK.  But for what reason?  We can see a lot of pain in this patch but
no gain.  The changelog should tell us what the benefit is, so we can make
informed tradeoff decisions.
