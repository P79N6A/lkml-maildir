Agreed, but it should be also noted that to be able to do
kernel coding is insufficient to do kernel design.
The same for user space, to be able to write correct C (or .*)
will not stop people to write code with unsane design, organization
and data structures.
You can see it on freshmeat and in many popular kernels every day.
I see it with my code every time I read my last-month source code.
