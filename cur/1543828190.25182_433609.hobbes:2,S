Subject: [PATCH 2.6.17 fix] bcm43xx: workaround init_board vs. IRQ race
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi John,
Please try to push this for 2.6.17, as it is a crash fix.
--
Place the Init-vs-IRQ workaround before any card register
access, because we might not have the wireless core mapped
at all times in init. So this will result in a Machine Check
caused by a bus error.
