Subject: [PATCH] Memory leak in visor.c and ftdi_sio.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/6/4/122

Note that I have not verified any of the below on
hardware associated with drivers/usb/serial/ftdi_sio.c,
only with drivers/usb/serial/visor.c.  If anyone has
hardware for this device, I would appreciate your comments.
A memory leak occurs in both drivers/usb/serial/ftdi_sio.c
and drivers/usb/serial/visor.c when the usb device is
unplugged while data is being written to the device.  This
patch should clear that up.
This was prepared against 2.6.7-rc2.
