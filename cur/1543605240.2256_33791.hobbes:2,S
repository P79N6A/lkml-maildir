unless it specifically has to be gameport, probably the easiest, best,
and cheapest way is to buy a playstation => usb adapter (~20AUD from
http://www.lik-sang.com
) and a playstation controller or two.  psx
dualshock controller costs ~50AUD and gives you 12 buttons, two analog
sticks, and a dpad... (in an imho very comfortable-to-use package)
you could then also use the dualshock to test bugs in the parallel port
psx driver, i believe the adapters are quite cheap to make and have the
added benefit of having the vibration feature supported (whereas it
doesnt seem to work with the usb adapter)
