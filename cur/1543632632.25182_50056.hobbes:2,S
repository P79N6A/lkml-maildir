Linus is doing things in his style. He has chosen a trusted lieutenant
(Kai) who is not a committed "true believer". Kai will work through
kbuild 2.5 and feed it to Linus in small batches. Keith will (should)
work with Kai. Thus a delegation and filtering step so Linus doesn't
have to understand every aspect of the change. Kai has done it before
(ISDN code) and Linus trusts him.
