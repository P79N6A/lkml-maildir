Subject: [PATCH] input / keyboard / Scancode Set 3 support broken
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi everybody!
If somebody uses keyboard scancode set 3 it is necessary to explicitly
program the keyboard to send make/break codes for all keys and to set
autorepeat for all keys. I reported this bug and the suggested fix to
Vojtech Pavlik almost a month ago and he published the enclosed patch.
This patch never made it to the main kernel tree, but it is really critical
for some people. One example is the LK461/46W series of keyboards from Digital 
Equipment Corporations. These are VMS keyboards that are also usable
on a normal PC. 
These keyboards support Scancode Set 2, but for some keys this support is
screwed up -- some function keys (e.g. F18/F20) report the same 
scancode sequence combined with both alt and shift keys.
Scancode Set 3 works perfectly if all keys are programmed to give make/break codes. 
A lot of keyboards manufactured by Cherry only make/break for some (not all!)
modifyer keys in scancode set 3 without this fix.
I believe that this patch is nothing but a very obvious bug fix, please
include it in the linux kernel.
cu,
 Knut Petersen
