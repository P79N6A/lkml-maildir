Is there no way to to get this information out of lspci (eg: lspci -vv)? This 
is particularly annoying since /proc/pci is depreciated. I know a number of 
people who simply don't bother turning it on anymore. If there is information 
in /proc/pci that isn't available through lspci somehow, then I'd call that a 
nasty regression, which needs to be fixed.
Are you sure on this Richard? (No disrespect intended, just want to confirm 
things).
