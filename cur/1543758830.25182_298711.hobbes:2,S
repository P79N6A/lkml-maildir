What I would like to see as an enduser is (dreaming):
 	kernel 2.6.x - last released
 	often released (every 1-2 weeks) kernel 2.6.x.z
 	containing just the answers to the often repeating
 	lkml questions which are answered with "use $this simple patch"
 	kernel 2.6.y-pre/rc/bk - development, working towards 2.6.y
in practice your proposed 2.6.even changes, but these continued until the 
next kernel is released, not stopped after 1-2 weeks with the worst fixes.
(a bit like the -as series, but with the "official blessing")
