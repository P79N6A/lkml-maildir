Good tip, nmi_watchdog=2 worked.  Unlike the previous freezes, after
this one it didn't continue after some minutes.  Don't know if that's
because the NMI oopser changed something, or if this is a slightly
different lockup...
No serial port on this laptop, so screenshot done with digicam:

Here are the transcribed stack traces:
CPU1
process: strace
 _spin_lock
 task_rq_lock
 wait_task_inactive
 ptrace_check_attach
 sys_ptrace
CPU0
process: fusexmp_fh (this is one of several similar threads being straced)
 _spin_lock_irq
 schedule
 ptrace_stop
 ptrace_notify
 syscall_trace
 syscall_trace_enter
 tracesys
Both these seem to be spinning on rq->lock, but who is holding this
lock?
