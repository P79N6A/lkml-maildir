Well, I have to say that I don't particularly like obviously 
architecture-specific stuff in an obviously non-architecture file..
I'd almost prefer to revert the thing that caused the problem, because 
with Adrian's patch, I think the end result may *work*, but it's uglier 
than what we started out with.
However, I think the *cleanest* solution right now may be something like 
the appended. Totally untested, of course. It basically just copies the 
generic kernel/Kconfig.instrumentation file into the arm directory, makes 
arm use its own instead of the generic one, and removes the dependencies 
on ARM in there (including all of the KPROBES entry that apparently isn't 
an issue on ARM anyway). It then adds back the ARM-specific ones.
This follows the sacred rules of good code:
 - generic code is either generic or not. If it's not generic, don't claim 
   it is.
 - don't *force* people to use generic code if it doesn't suit them. Make 
   it available for the cases it makes sense for, but don't shoe-horn it 
   into cases where it doesn't work well.
So it allows the sharing of the common case and *many* architectures end 
up using the generic Kconfig file, but hey, if it doesn't make sense for 
ARM, it doesn't make sense for ARM. It's that simple.
But as mentioned, it's totally untested and I don't have (or really want 
to have) a cross-compiling environment. And I don't care *that* much. I 
just want something we can all live with.
So does something like this work for people?
