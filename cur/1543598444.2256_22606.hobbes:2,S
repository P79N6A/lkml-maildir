It's always a blessing and a curse when people seem to be haveing
problems with the same drivers as you.  I started looking into this
when I user complained about disk access time.  I think this is
related to the running aic7xxx topics.
>From my tests, I got a Dell 4400 who's Adaptec 7899P, according to
bonnie++, was writing slower then some of my my IDE drives on a
different system.  I tried Red Hat's 2.4.3-12smp kernel and got a
little improvement.  I then built 2.4.9 and started running bonnie++
again and my syslog gets filled up with such errors:

With slow access time.  Please request more info if you think it might
help.
