I'm afraid. I still think that it will never be needed even removing
lock_kernel(), because doing that we would need to make atomic the
decreasing of mm->count with current->mm = &init_mm, otherwise we would
not know if we can touch the current->mm of a process at any time. 
It's far from be like the semaphore case where we avoid the spinlock to
not race because we can order our moves differently if we are in down() or
in up(). 
But maybe I am missing something, but it's what I think though.
