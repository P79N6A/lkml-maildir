I don't. The 20Mb is almost all shared across the processes - but it
IS mostly writable. With overcommit, it's fine. Without it, I'd need
to throw an extra Gb or so of swap into the machine, just to overcome
the non-overcommit bug.
Disabling overcommit does NOT prevent ANY problems. It just changes
the nature of a problem, making it much more frequent and a bit more
predictable. A bit like compensating for an occasionally leaking seal
on a submarine by removing the seal entirely.

You don't need to add RAM to overcome overcommit - you'd need to throw
a Gb or so of swap at them to compensate for NOT having it.
