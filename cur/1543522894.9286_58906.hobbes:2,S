Is there a version of the Ext3 Patch that works with the 2.3.x series of
kernels? Preferably 2.3.39... I was running it (EXT3) on 2.2.13 without a
problem... but need some of the drivers from under 2.3.39 (DRI &&
Frame Buffer for V3 amongst others)... or should I
"try" to port the 2.2.13 Ext3 patch to 2.3.39?
