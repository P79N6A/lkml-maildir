Disabling the NMI watchdog for that is out of question. It's a important
debugging device and without it kernel bug reports are much worse.
It increased the quality of x86-64 bug reports over the years
considerably and I'm unwilling to give that up.
I didn't realize oprofile did this so far, but I plan to definitely 
fix this.

TSC also doesn't count cycles in many circumstances (different frequency 
depending on P states or not synchronized over CPUs, even running
at completely different frequencies etc.)

Then you don't use TSC because it's not stable (or conversely
too stable for many performance measurements because it doesn't
follow the P states)

Good debugging infrastructure has priority imho - and NMI watchdog
is important. You will need to live with three counters.
This means there is one alternative - some of the newer chipsets
have external watchdogs that could be also used (using the ACPI WDOG
table).  If someone writes a nice NMI driver for these then on system
with working WDOG it could replace the perfctr based timeout and free
the perfctr. That would need some code to allocate and deallocate
perfctrs though.
The older IOAPIC watchdog is no alternative because it runs too often (at HZ) 
and has too much overhead.
