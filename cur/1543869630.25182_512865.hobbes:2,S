yeah. I'm not surprised. The PDA is not set up in create_async_thread() 
for example.

yep, this is a good first cut. Doing this after the listen() is useful:
        int one = 1;
        ret = setsockopt(listen_sock_fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR,
			 (char *)&one, sizeof(int));
and i'd suggest to do this after every accept()-ed socket:
        int flag = 1;
        setsockopt(sock_fd, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_NODELAY,
                            (char *) &flag, sizeof(int));
Do you have any link where i could check the type of HTTP parsing and 
send transport you are (or will be) using? What type of http client are 
you using to measure, with precisely what options?

single-core CPU i suspect?

mean question: do you promise to post the results even if they are not 
unfavorable to threadlets? ;-)
if i want to test kevents on a v2.6.20 kernel base, do you have an URL 
for me to try?
