Can we not introduce new pio-maps in the device trees? There
were debates regarding this, and if I understood everything
correctly, pio-maps considered as a bad taste. Better
do bunch of par_io_config_pin() in the board file. Better
yet fixup the firmware (u-boot) to set up dedicated pins
correctly.
Thanks,
