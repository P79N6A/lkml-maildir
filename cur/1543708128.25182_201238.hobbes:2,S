I worked around this one in radeonfb by only mapping part of the
framebuffer (see current version in linus tree), but that's sub
optimal. Better is to implement full accel and not map the fb
at all. But good enough for now, the other problems are more
important imho.

Yes. Working on it.

I would appreciate if you did so ;) Please let me know what you find.

I have this problem since the very beginning. The very first
shift-pageup to display things properly from the back buffer, but to not
_erase_ properly, until you do a bit of ping pong (down up down up) so
that your screen end up properly refreshed.

I never use modules for fbdevs

It does. Radeonfb did one step in this direction, but that's not
enough. _BUT_ we still need to differenciate between a full mode 
passed from userland from a mode where we _KNOW_ everything is
bogus but width/height... In the later case, we really want to
find a mode that is just large enough for the passed in width/height
(but not smaller, or just fail if not found) and with the same
hfreq if possible as the current mode. That's really a different
request than a full blown mode coming from userland (like a 'tuning'
tool or whatever...)
The FB_ACTIVATE_FIND is just that. It justs tells the driver to
pick up a mode based on width/height only. We know the rest of
the var is bogus.

Yes, but that's less urgent than the other ones. We really need to fix
those basic behaviour problems before multihead. Multihead will come
later as I will implement dual head support in radeonfb. That leads to
a while bunch of problems with the userland API that need to be improed
too, and that leads to the problem of properly soft booting additional
cards. I have various ideas to address those problems, but that's
definitely less urgent than the list I wrote down.
