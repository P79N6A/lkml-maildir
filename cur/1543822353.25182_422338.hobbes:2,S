I'm a bit curious about how this is true.  There are all sorts of way in
which there could be activity against these pages - interrupt-time
asynchronous network Tx completion, async interrupt-time direct-io
completion, tasklets, schedule_work(), etc, etc.
So...  could we check your homework on this please?  How come only page
reclaim can disturb these pages?
