But of course, you're completely right. And I have to correct my own
statement: not only RH5.x ldd's crash the system. At home it crashed my
machine with the same versions of ldd, glibc as the other at work. The only
major difference was that at home I have an AMDK6-2 and no SCSI drivers in the
kernel. Maybe that's also of some importance.
