That's right, kids.  And furthermore, we had to walk to the computer
center uphill.  Both ways.  In the snow.  Empty out the chad buckets
twice a day.  And crimp backplane wires with our teeth, while the
machine was *on*!

Alas, this is not a solution -- because expanding all the abbrevs would
just get us into the argument over "kilobytes" vs.  "kibibytes".  And,
while I can just barely make myself choke down "KiB" for the sake of
clarity, "kibibytes" is beyond my tolerance.  Aaarrggghhh....

All governments are more or less combinations against the
people. . .and as rulers have no more virtue than the ruled. . .
the power of government can only be kept within its constituted
bounds by the display of a power equal to itself, the collected
sentiment of the people.
