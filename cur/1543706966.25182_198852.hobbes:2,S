(a) The idiot thing was screwed wrt. binutils when the things were
	prefixed with e.g. sparc64-linux-gnu-$PROG; I managed to decipher
	where the paths were and just patch in the names of the crossutils.
(b) The stuff produced broken kernels; I had to resort to native builds
	anyway (which far from ideal, since it target violates host/target
	separation), and lost money getting a second of its kind to repair
	that state of affairs.
