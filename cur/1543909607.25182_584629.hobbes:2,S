So that there would be no hot single file, I cut the
MAINTAINER file into single file segments in maintainers/*
00_descriptions
3c359_network_driver
3c505_network_driver
3c59x_network_driver
3cr990_network_driver
...
zd1211rw_wireless_driver
zf_machz_watchdog
zr36067_video_for_linux_driver
zs_decstation_z85c30_serial_driver
zz_the_rest
611 files.
How could "make" make a single MAINTAINERS?
	"cat [0-9a-z]* > ../MAINTAINERS"?
Would it need to?
Anyone have suggestions for Makefile/Kconfig support?
