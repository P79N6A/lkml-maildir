Sure some properties contain (or _should_ contain!) just
one simple text string.  You can simply "cat" those when
they are binary in the filesystem too FWIW.

But that is just one simple use of the filesystem.  One that
doesn't work at all on PowerPC btw -- at kernel run time,
we don't have access to OF at all anymore.

I never was talking about modifying.  Most things that
most users want to modify aren't normal OF properties
anyway, but configuration variables.  In some/many OF
implementations updating those via the device tree doesn't
work.

If the text representation in the file system was unambiguous,
it wouldn't be useless for scripts anymore, merely very
inconvenient.
