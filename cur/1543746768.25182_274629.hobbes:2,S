Cute idea. So any new definition which is supposed to be used in 
userspace will take at least a year to propagate - well, I know, one can 
always look for the definition in the kernel headers, copy it, ...
Now this is no solution.
And how do you want to deal with the fact that up to now all the 
netfilter headers required for userspace programming live in the kernel 
include tree? Now this has been like this for quite some years. Shall 
one no longer use netfilter?
It is easy to be happy with the status quo and to reject any attempt to 
change things for the better. If you really wanted to fix (g)libc you 
would have taken action long ago. You're around for long enough.
