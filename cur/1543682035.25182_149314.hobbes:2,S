Agreed, it should. However, the last version I pulled had zero support for
probeall, and more importantly for probe, which is somewhat harder to do
cleanly without having to rewrite the config file for each kernel you
boot.
I assume someone will need to write a functional config parser which
handles these features before 2.6 is seriously ready for production.
Giving up the ability to find the working module for a device would be a
step back, and is needed to allow booting with changing configurations,
such as docked or not laptops, PCMCIA cards inserted, various hardware
such as printers and scanners attached, etc.
