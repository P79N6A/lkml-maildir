They only do so because they are on different release cycles.

Sure, that's one of the reasons.  But not the only one by far (I have a
whole list somewhere, I'm sure it's in the archives...)

"pretty low"?  hahahahaha.  As Arjan has said, the time and energy to do
this for a long period of time is huge.  If I were you, I would listen
to the people who have and do maintain these kinds of kernels, it's not
a simple job by any means.
But by all means, if you want to try to do this, please do.  I wish you
good luck.
