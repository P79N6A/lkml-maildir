I fixed that with the old solution-via-changelog:
  Because keventd is a resource which is shared between unrelated parts
  of the kernel it is possible for one person's workqueue handler to
  accidentally call another person's flush_scheduled_work().  thockin
  managed it by calling mntput() from a workqueue handler.  It deadlocks.
  It's simple enough to fix: teach flush_scheduled_work() to go direct
  when it discovers that the calling thread is the one which should be
  running the work.
  Note that this can cause recursion.  The depth of that recursion is
  equal to the number of currently-queued works which themselves want to
  call flush_scheduled_work().  If this ever exceeds three I'll eat my hat.
Really, it's so unlikely it's hardly worth bothering about.

How's this?
Add a debug check for workqueues nested more than three deep via the
direct-run-workqueue() path.
