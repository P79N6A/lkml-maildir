It's easy to reproduce on 2-way x86, however it doesn't look like a kernel
bug.

process 4726 is sleeping at the end of do_exit():
	schedule();		<<- here
	BUG();
	/* Avoid "noreturn function does return".  */
	for (;;) ;
}
So it has completely exitted and is waiting for someone to reap its exit
code and stack slot via wait4().  So what is its parent up to?

The parent is sleeping in select() rather than wait()ing for children.

For 3,000 seconds.
I changed your 3000 to 30 and lo, the script hangs for 30 seconds every now
and then, and then resumes.
