Humm, I'm not sure I'm entirely happy with that choice.  I have an 
FC3RC5 install on an old P-II running at 233mhz, and the udev start 
in the bootup is the slowest single thing to get started by an order 
of magnitude.
Can someone tell me a good reason udev wastes as much time as the post 
does checking 383 megs of memory, which is very nearly a minute even 
just for udev?
If its to be used, its got to speed itself up, a LOT!.
