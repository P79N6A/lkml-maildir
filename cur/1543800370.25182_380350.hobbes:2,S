Its not the hands that swap, its the lists. The hands will lap each
other, like the minute hand will lap the hour hand every ~65 minutes.
Let me try some ascii art.
   ====
  ^---<>---v
       ====
'='	a page
'^---<' hand cold
'>---v' hand hot
now let hand cold move 4 pages:
   
  ^---<>---v
   ========
ie. hand hot and hand cold have the same position.
now if we want to move hand cold one more position this happens:
   =======
  ^---<>---v
          =
see the swap?
