Actually I didn't need to change a single line in do_wp_page because
ptep_clear_flush was already doing everything transparently for
me. This was the memory.c part of my last patch I posted, it only
touches zap_page_range, remap_pfn_range and apply_to_page_range.

In that place the mmap_sem is taken but in readonly mode. I never rely
on the mmap_sem in the mmu notifier methods. Not invoking the notifier
before releasing the PT lock adds quite some uncertainty on the smp
safety of the spte invalidates, because the pte may be unmapped and
remapped by a minor fault before invalidate_range is invoked, but I
didn't figure out a kernel crashing race yet thanks to the pin we take
through get_user_pages (and only thanks to it). The requirement is
that invalidate_range is invoked after the last ptep_clear_flush or it
leaks pins that's why I had to move it at the end.
