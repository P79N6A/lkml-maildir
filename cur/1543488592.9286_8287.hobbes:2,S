1) I'm not on the mailing list -- I'm not *THAT* good at coding/whatnot to
feel like it'd be worth everybody's time :) -- in other words, please CC
any replies to this address (talein@whitestar.soark.net)
2) I noticed while compiling gnome today that my PID's "rolled-over"
several times -- and have always liked keeping track of how high I get
between my mom's reboots to '95 -- so I was wondering it if's possible --
or if anybody's done it -- to increase (I assume it's in the kernel) the
pid -- from short to unsigned short? -- when I'd brought it up on IRC, the
only con anybody had was if any processes used the sign bit -- which seems
unlikely -- I'd even ask about increasing to long or something -- but I
know that'd mess up top and stuff (ok -- it's just cosmetic, but so is my
request) -- so does anybody know how to do this, or know why it
*shouldn't* be done? -- I looked through the kernel tree -- but I've only
been writing C for a few months -- and looking at the kernel src is a bit
... intimidating :)
