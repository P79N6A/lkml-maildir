The fix is definitely in -rc5 (thanks), and without doubt fixed the problem I 
was seeing (thanks Dmitry).  I haven't tested on a vanilla 2.6.12-rc5, but I 
can confirm that 2.6.12-rc4-mm* releases have not had the problem.  The patch 
was of course in -rc4-mm* and possibly earlier?

2.6.12-rc4-mm* releases have been stable, I haven't seen any oopses for a few 
weeks now.
If confirmation is required in -rc5 then I'm happy to attempt this, but I 
don't think it's at all likely given I haven't seen any oopses at all since 
that patch was included in -mm, and the patch is now in upstream.
Btw, I didn't see a lkml-announce message about -rc5-mm1 being released :(  No 
big deal really...
