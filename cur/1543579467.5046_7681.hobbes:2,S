Well, maybe.
Then again, I could easily see those I/O devices go the general embedded  
route, which in a decade or two could well mean they run some sort of  
embedded Linux on the controller.
Which would make some features rather easy to implement.
(Think about it: twenty years from mow, a typical desktop machine may be a  
heterogenous Linux cluster. Didn't someone say something about World  
Domination?)
(Note that I predicted this 2001-01-20T16:35:30. Just in case it actually  
works out that way.)
