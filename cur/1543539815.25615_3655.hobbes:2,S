No. The SCSI generic driver (sg) is a character
device and thus cannot be mounted. Sg also has
no concept of partitions. Its unit of addressing
is a device and its transactions are in terms of
SCSI commands. No censorship other than requiring
read and write permissions on a device. For example
my disk has default (sensible) permissions:
$ cd /dev/scsi/host1/bus0/target0/lun0/
$ ls -l disc generic 
brw-------    1 root     root   8,   0 Dec 31  1969 disc
crw-------    1 root     root  21,   0 Dec 31  1969 generic
Those device filenames aren't really that old.
