Yes. Like said in earlier email we could ignore the slowdown and
duplicate the mm/rmap.c code inside kvm, but that looks a bad layering
violation and it's unnecessary, dirty and suboptimal IMHO.

Another issue is that for things like the page sharing driver, it's
more convenient to be able to know exactly which "sptes" belongs to a
certain userland mapping, and only that userland mapping (not all
others mappings of the physical page). So if the rmap becomes page
based, it'd be nice to still be able to find the "mm" associated with
that certain spte pointer to skip all sptes in the other "mm" during
the invalidate.
