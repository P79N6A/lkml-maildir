It might be quite useful to know it for sure.
Thinking about the whole set of changes, you are right, that the
current check for the first page only is not correct, but I don't see
how your changes make it more correct.
The correct way to fix this is to check, whether all the small pages,
which fit in the range of the large page, which we want to preserve,
have the same resulting pgprot flags.
Thanks,
