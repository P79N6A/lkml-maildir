Thanks to Jerry McBride, I think the problem is this. 
The BIOS reports the CPUs as MP, but the kernel detects them as XP. As Jerry
pointed out you can't run dual XP processors.
I just grabbed the box the CPUs came in. It states the CPUs are MP.
How can I tell if the problem is with the BIOS, CPUs or kernel?
