I guess I need to "leverage" some bits for netperf :)
WRT getting data with links that cannot saturate a system, having
something akin to the netperf service demand measure can help. Nothing
terribly fancy - simply a conversion of the CPU utilization and
throughput to a microseconds of CPU to transfer a KB of data. 
As for CKO and avoiding copies and such, if past experience is any guide
(
ftp://ftp.cup.hp.com/dist/networking/briefs/copyavoid.ps
) you get a
very nice synergistic effect once the last "access" of data is removed.
CKO gets you say 10%, avoiding the copy gets you say 10%, but doing both
at the same time gets you 30%.
