Kosaki-san:  You've tested V3 on '.24.  Do you want to repost the patch
refreshed against .24, adding your "Tested-by:"  [and "Signed-off-by:",
as the folding of the contextualization into mpol_check_policy() is
based on your code--apologies for not adding it myself]?  I'm tied up
with something else for most of this week and won't get to it until
Friday, earliest.

Lee
P.S., As Andrew pointed out, I forgot to run checkpatch and the patch
does include a violation thereof.
