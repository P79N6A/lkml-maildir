Subject: 2.4.15-pre5 conflict between acpi and a.out, affs is implicated

include/asm-*/a.out.h defines STACK_TOP.  So does
drivers/acpi/include/acinterp.h, with a different value.  The conflict
occurs if you compile with acpi and a.out, or with acpi and affs.  For
reasons that are beyond me, include/linux/affs_fs_i.h contains #include
<linux/a.out.h>.
ACPI needs to use a different name.
Why does affs_fs_i.h include a.out.h?
