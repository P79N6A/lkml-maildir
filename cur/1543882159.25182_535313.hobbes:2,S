Hi Andi,
Backing out x86_64-mm-vdso.patch allowed this kernel to build and boot
successful on the machine in question (elm3b6). The backout caused one reject
in Documentation/kernel-parameters but otherwise backed out easily. It's
not super-clear why it fails to build. If you want me to try another patch,
make sure I'm cc'd and I'll give it a spin.
