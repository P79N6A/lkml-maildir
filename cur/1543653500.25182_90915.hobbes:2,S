I have noticed something with the IDE drivers especially with the Seagate
drives. The promise driver (eg 20277) detects the UDMA 5 mode correctly.
This is what it does:
        byte ultra_66           = ((id->dma_ultra & 0x0010) ||
                                   (id->dma_ultra & 0x0008)) ? 1 : 0;
        byte ultra_100          = ((id->dma_ultra & 0x0020) ||
                                   (ultra_66)) ? 1 : 0;
        byte ultra_133          = ((id->dma_ultra & 0x0040) ||
                                   (ultra_100)) ? 1 : 0;
Now, lets take a PIIX driver
	 int ultra100            = ((dev->device ==
PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82801BA_8) ||
                                   (dev->device ==
PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82801BA_9) ||
                                   (dev->device ==
PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82801CA_10)) ? 1 : 0;
        int ultra66             = ((ultra100) ||
                                   (dev->device ==
PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82801AA_1) ||
                                   (dev->device ==
PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82372FB_1)) ? 1 : 0;
        if ((id->dma_ultra & 0x0020) && (udma_66) && (ultra100)) {
                speed = XFER_UDMA_5;
where ultra100 and ultra66 is not or'ed with 0x0010 and 0x0008. The final
check is only with 0x0020. I have found this issues with other IDE drivers
like amd74xx.c, serverworks.c etc. SO, make the above changes in the drivers
and u should see UDMA 5 on those seagate drives on startup ...
Thanks
Manish

If I remember rightly 2.4.19 doesnt have full support for the AMD
760MP/X although
