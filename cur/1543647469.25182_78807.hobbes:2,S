Well, a rmmod could potentially leave the module in "deleted" but not 
"freed" state for a long time. Basically the same thing which happens for 
your solution, where you call the state "cleanup". But I agree, this is 
not desirable at all (nor do I think your cleanup state is). That's why I 
said you should be using the right APIs. And the network layer does things 
correctly, you don't need any MOD_INC_USE_COUNT in your network driver at 
all, just set .owner and the network layer does it all and race-free for 
you.

Well, I don't think I have a general problem with allowing module_exit()  
to fail, though again I don't think it's necessary for drivers which use
safe standard APIs. I'm not sure about your cleanup state, why is that
necessary? Say you do pci_unregister_driver() in your module_exit(). That
means that no users will find your driver on the list of all drivers, so
they have nothing to do try_inc_mod_count() on, which you're trying to
protect against? This is, AFAICS, currently only needed to guarantee
race-free access to the module's use count. Since you're only using that
as a hint right now and leave the final decision to ->exit(), it shouldn't
be necessary.

(This example seems to emphasize what I just said, no checking for state 
cleanup neeeded, at least I don't see it).
You're right, code providing standard APIs to drivers (be it filesystem 
drivers or network card drivers) need to be aware that these drivers can 
be modular, and need to get that case right.
However, the try_inc_mod_count() is only ever used in the slow 
registration paths (in the example e.g. for mounting, but not for accesses 
to a mounted file system), so performance is not an issue. And getting 
APIs exported to drivers right needs thinking, yes, but the module 
locking isn't even the hard part there, I would claim.
What you are doing is basically removing the infrastructure to get the use 
count right in a race-free way, and cope with the race by leaving modules 
in 'cleanup' but not 'freed' state until the users you raced with have 
gone away.
BTW, the patch below also needs changes to each filesystem driver to 
return &fs->refcnt as ->use_count(), I think. And since there's no global 
lock to protect it, as opposed to the unload_lock for the old module use 
count, you have no way to protect the use_count between checking it 
to be zero and calling ->exit(). It can be incremented in between, and you 
cover up for that race by failing ->exit(), leaving the file_system in 
used but not registered state. I just don't like this any better.
