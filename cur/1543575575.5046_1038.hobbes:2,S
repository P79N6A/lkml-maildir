   Really?
   I was thinking about the pcivtophys() alias bus_dvma_to_mem() hackery used
   to retrieve the actual BAR address from the so-called pcidev bar cookies.
Really :-)  This conversation was about drivers making modifications
to PCI config space areas which are being argued to be only modified
by arch-specific PCI support layers.  That is the context in which
I made my statements.
Interpreting physical BAR values is another issue altogether.  Kernel
wide interfaces for this may be easily added to include/asm/pci.h
infrastructure, please just choose some sane name for it and I will
compose a patch ok? :-)
