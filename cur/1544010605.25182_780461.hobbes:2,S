For 1 or 2 lines to set error value before checking condition, that's a clean coding style. But for
more places in one function to set error value this way, I can't say that's perfect.
lookup_bdev() is just in my code review stack, the way to set error value just makes me
uncomfortable. Maybe it is because my threshold (>=3) is lower than others. This patch can not bring
up any *real* faster, but sending it out makes me feel better at least :)
