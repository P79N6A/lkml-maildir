It seems you compiled in support for "PATA", more specifically for:
> 00:09.0 IDE interface: nVidia Corporation nForce2 IDE (rev a2)
"<*> AMD/NVidia PATA support (Experimental)"
in the "Serial ATA (prod) and Parallel ATA (experimental) drivers" menu 
under "Device Drivers". PATA is what is also known as IDE and the PATA 
drivers are a new set of IDE drivers, using the same infrastructure as 
SCSI and SATA (and USB, and ..). Yes, they're newly integrated in 
2.6.20. One of the advatages of these new drivers are better error 
handling than the old IDE driver.
I'm using that same specific driver by the way (on amd756) and it's 
working very nicely for me.
Rene.
