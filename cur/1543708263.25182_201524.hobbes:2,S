Not sure about Christopher's case, but I think it actually might be
easier generally. First, copying rather than initializing ensures
we've already got the algorithm loaded and locked and don't have to
worry particularly whether we're in a difficult context. 
Second, if there are cases (and this may be one, I forget the details
of HMAC) where there's significant per-use setup costs, having a
copying interface saves work. If you've got a copy interface, you
don't really need the second kind of user-managed initialize interface
I proposed earlier.

Ok, I probably spin something like this in the next couple days.
