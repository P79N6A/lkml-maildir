Absolutely.
In fact, the whole "kdev_t" makes no sense if we have proper char_dev and
block_dev pointers.
We have "dev_t" which is what we export to user space. And if we split up
char dev and block dev (which I'm an avid proponent for), kdev_t will be
an anachronism.

Sure. If something like devfs _knows_ the device pointers from the very
beginning, then just do: 
 - increment reference count
 - inode->dev.char = cdev;

No. 
But the pointer is not a 1:1 thing (otherwise we'd just put the whole
request queue _into_ the block device).
The block device should have a pointer to the request queue, along with
the partitioning information. Why? Because that way it becomes very simple
indeed to do request processing: none of the current "look up the proper
queue for each request and do the partition offset magic inside each
driver". Instead, the queuing function becomes:
	bh->index = bdev->index;
	bh->sector += bdev->sector_offset;
	submit_bh(bh, bdev->request_queue);
and you're done. Those three lines did both the queue lookup, the
"index" for the driver, and the partitioning offset. Whoa, nelly.
And THAT is why you want to have the queue pointer in the bdev structure.
