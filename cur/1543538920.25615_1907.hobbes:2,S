Hmmm. Just as well I resisted the temptation to include a handful of...
 #if LINUX_VERSION_CODE < 0x20400
	MOD_INC_USE_COUNT
 #endif
... in the last patch I sent you then :)
But that's for 2.2 / 2.4 compatibility, and to be fair, that really has to 
be considered Someone Else's Problem (mine in this case - bollocks).
