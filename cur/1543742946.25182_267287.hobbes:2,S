Apologies to akpm if you're not getting this directly ... OSDL is spitting

? which global lock are we talking about now? the buddy allocator? mmm,
yes, might well do. OTOH, with hot/cold pages the lock should hardly
be contended at all (512-ways scare me, yes ... but they're broken in
lots of other ways ;-) ... do we have lockmeter data from one?

I think the hotlist was set to refill from the cold list before it refilled
from the buddy ... or it was at one point.

well, it'd only save RAM in theory on SMP systems where the load was
very unevenly distributed across CPUs ... it's out of the reserved pool.

Let's see what it does on the macro-benchmarks ;-)
