Power and cooling should be fine, and I've checked fans etc for correct
functioning - all is ok.  The other thing worth noting is that the problems
with this machine only started once the USB/NTFS HDD started being used.
Before this the machine has been rock solid for 2+ years, and the usage
patterns haven't changed.  Anyway, I'll keep an eye on it and post any
subsequent information as it becomes available.
