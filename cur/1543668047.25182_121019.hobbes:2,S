Old device numbers remain valid, so all changes are completely
transparent.

If you do not use mknod to create device nodes with large device numbers,
then no new utilities are needed. If you really want to use large
device numbers, you need a new glibc; some utilities will require
recompilation because of the use of sysmacros.h.
