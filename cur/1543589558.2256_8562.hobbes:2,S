Don't ask me why, but I think you may find it's Peter's patch to
the women-and-children-first in kernel/fork.c: I'm not yet running
-ac2, but I am trying that patch, fine on UP but hanging right there
(well, I get a "go go go" message too) on SMP.
Try reversing the:
-	p->counter = current->counter;
-	current->counter = 0;
+	p->counter = (current->counter + 1) >> 1;
+	current->counter >>= 1;
+	current->policy |= SCHED_YIELD;
and see if that works for you too.
