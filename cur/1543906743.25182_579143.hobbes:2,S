I respectfully disagree. The power of msleep is that the unit of sleep
time is in the name; so in your proposal it would be hr_msleep or
somesuch. I much rather do the opposite in that case; make the "short"
name be the best implementation of the requested behavior, and have
qualifiers for allowing exceptions to that... least surprise and all
that.
