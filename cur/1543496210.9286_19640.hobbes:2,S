Hi Trevor.
 > Are Cyrix MII-300 [...] known to be major heat sources?
My experience has been that all Cyrix processors generate far
more heat than the equivalent Intel, and these in turn generate
slightly more heat than the equivalent AMD processor, although
there's little to choose between the last two in this regard.
I understand some fan manufacturers have separate fans for Cyrix
and non-Cyrix processors for precicely this reason.
You may wish to check whether your Cyrix processor has a non-Cyrix
fan on it, as that could easily be the cause of your problem.
Best wishes from Riley.
