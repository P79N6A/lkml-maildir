Hi all,
I'm having a hard time figuring out how to use the transparent proxy support 
in Linux.
For exemple, I have here an Apache server configured to do HTTP and FTP 
proxying. When I configure Netscape to use that machine as a proxy, all works 
well. But when I tell Netscape to NOT use a proxy, and configure the firewall 
to redirect all outgoing TCP paquets addressed to port 80, to the proxy's 
port, then it doesn't work. Which seems normal to me since the HTTP request 
Netscape sends is not a valid proxy request.
So how do you guys make it work ? It would really be neat to be able to have 
all the proxy's advantages (save in bandwidth, better end-user response) 
without the hassles (having to configure all the end-user stations)...
thanks!
