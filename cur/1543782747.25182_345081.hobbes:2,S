Subject: [PATCH] mod_devicetable.h fixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

	* ieee1394_device_id has kernel_ulong_t field after an odd number of
__u32 ones.  Since mod_devicetable.h is included both from kernel and from
host build helper, we may be in trouble if we are building on 32bit host for
64bit target - userland sees unsigned long long, kernel sees unsigned long
and while their sizes match, alignments might not.  Fixed by forcing alignment.
Fortunately, almost nobody else needs that - the rest of such fields is
naturally aligned as it is.
	* of_device_id has void * in it.  Host userland helpers need
kernel_ulong_t instead, since their void * might have nothing to do
with the kernel one.  Fixed in the same way it's done for similar problems
in pcmcia_device_id (ifdef __KERNEL__).
	* pcmcia_device_id has the same problem as ieee1394_device_id.
Fixed the same way.
