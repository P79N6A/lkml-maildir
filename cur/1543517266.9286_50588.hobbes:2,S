Excuse me?
What were you trying to do? What Linux Distribution? Version? Architecture?
Hardware? Kernel version? Runing what application? What did the error look
like (exact output)?  What did you do before the error happened?
You'll have to tell us a bit more if you want help. Calling the doctor
telling him "my left toe hurts" will not help you much either.
