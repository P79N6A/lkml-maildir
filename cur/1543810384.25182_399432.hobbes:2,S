hi
i have kernel 2.6.9, with FC2, on an AMD64 Dual Opteron.
[root@btv 28]# cat /proc/interrupts
           CPU0       CPU1
  0:   22249515   39262513    IO-APIC-edge  timer

i was wondering, if IRQ28's (eth0) affinity is set to the default "f"
[root@btv 28]# cat /proc/irq/prof_cpu_mask
f
[root@btv 28]# cat /proc/irq/28/smp_affinity
f
and irqbalance is not running, why aren't the interrupts coming from eth0
balanced between the two processors? at least that's what i understood from the
examples in Documentation/IRQ-affinity.txt. are there any other settings/kernel
parameters/compile option one has to set?
(pls msg me in private, i'm not on the list.)
thanks
