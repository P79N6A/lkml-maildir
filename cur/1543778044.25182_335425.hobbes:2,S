Subject: kernel 2.4.20, 2.4.21, 2.4.22 , ... does not compile with gcc-3.4.X

Dear Developers,
This might be a known issue but it is not known to me!
I tried to compile kernel 2.4.22 under Crux Linux,
and the compilation stopped in sched.c. I do not have
to say much to you because it seems a compiler
problem!
I guess that it would compile nicely with gcc-3.3.X.
The problem is in the following piece of code:
#define FASTCALL(x)     x __attribute__((regparm(3)))
for instance in the following piece of code:
// file inc.h
//------------
#ifndef inc_h
#define inc_h
#define FASTCALL(x)     x __attribute__((regparm(3)))
extern int FASTCALL(wake_up(double a));
#endif
// file inc.c
//------------
#include "inc.h"
inline int wake_up(double a)
{
    return (int) a;
}
root@archon# gcc-3.4.4 inc.c -c 
inc.c:3: error: conflicting types for 'wake_up'
inc.h:5: error: previous declaration of 'wake_up' was
here
inc.c:3: error: conflicting types for 'wake_up'
inc.h:5: error: previous declaration of 'wake_up' was
here
root@archon# gcc-3.3.1 inc.c -c 
root@archon#
so it is indeed a compiler problem!
The question is how do I compile a 2.4.X kernel with 
gcc-3.4.X?
Thanks in advance!
Best Wishes!
Drosos,
