dump(8) doesn't hang when dumping mounted filesystems. You are refering
to a genuine bug which was fixed some time ago.
However, in some rare occasions, dump can save corrupted data when
saving a mounted and generaly highly active filesystem. Even then,
in 99% of the cases it doesn't really matter because the corrupted
files will get saved by the next incremental dump.
Come on, who REALLY expects to have consistent backups without
either unmounting the filesystem or using some snapshot techniques ?
