I might be missing a point, but why do _we_ care that much about x86
compatibility? I see why M$ and others want it will all their closed
source applications but for Linux it is just a matter of recompilation
and that is what people really want to do. You say you care very
little about kernel module binary compatibility, why do you suddenly
care about compatibility of binary only user land applictions?
I do not say we should use one byte order or the other, I just don't
see x86 binaries as a big reason reason for choosing one over the
other.
