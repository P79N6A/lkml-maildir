With the silly nits like that aside, it leaves just the
more serious 'issues' such as those brought up by Willy
earlier.
The whole idea of a seperate mmnommu (or was it nommumm/ ?)

horrible name) I didn't check the code in detail, but
is there really that little that can be shared between
the regular mm/ ?
