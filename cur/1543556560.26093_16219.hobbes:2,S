Alan, what's the approach you'd feel more comfortable with:
- One ioctl that passes a pointer to a known structure in ifr.ifr_data as 
  its argument.
- Several ioctl's, one for each parameter, that pass only the specific 
  parameter new value as the argument.
The former is good because it relies on a _single_ ioctl. However, every
time you change the ioctl structure you may lose backward compatibility.
The latter is good because new implementations / features won't affect
previous working features. However, it'd create a huge list of ioctl's.
Please let me know whatcha think.
Later,
Ivan
