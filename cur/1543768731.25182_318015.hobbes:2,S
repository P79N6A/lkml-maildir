Of course you do.  Think about CTS flow control where the other end
is also busy and has to drain its tty buffers before it can allow
the remote end to proceed.  (And who says its another Linux box
anyway?)
However, if people are using CTS flow control, they want reliable
logging.  Therefore, it's even questionable whether we should even
time out (but we do to keep the system "running".)
