This might be curses "optimalization". mc liked to do something
similar when scrolling: it was both inefficient delete N lines
implementation in kernel (which did it line-by-line) and
[miss-]optimalization by curses.
Don't look at tgafb. This is most probably not tga specific. Look at
output from mutt for "insert N characters" escape sequence.
