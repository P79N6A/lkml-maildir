Subject: [PATCH] Remove needless and non-portable include in mtd
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello David,
The #include <asm/setup.h> in drivers/mtd/cmdlinepart.c does not appear to
provide any definition this file uses, and it quickly breaks builds on
architectures that lack such a header, including ia64 and sparc.
This applies to your CVS and linux-2.5 BK as of 0700 UTC 10/20/2003 and passes
an allyesconfig on (with unrelated exceptions) i386, ia64, and sparc.  I do not
have the hardware to test it further, but I think the change is straightforward.
Please let me know if you need further information.
I will probably send you at least one more MTD compatibility patch.
Thanks,
Noah
