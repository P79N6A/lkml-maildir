This is a single CPU system, not dual.  The kernel is compiled for a
single CPU system as well.
Looking at .config, I notice that Processor family is set to
Pentium-Pro/Celeron/Pentium-II.  I could have *sworn* I changed that
before compiling.  Could that cause the problem I'm seeing?
In any case, I'll try to get some time early next week to try the patch -
this is, unfortunately, a work machine, and as such, needs to work, even
if I go with 2.2.x.  :)
I'll let you know when I can try out the patch.
