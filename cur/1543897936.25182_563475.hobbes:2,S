Why? I'm not questioning the policy, it's just that if HUGE kernel 
versions are kept available forever, a tiny man page tar would not seem 
to be a disk space issue.

Why not just a link with a fixed name (LATEST?) which could be updated? 
I assume installing a new version is automated to create and install the 
tar, any needed links, the push to mirrors, etc. So it would just be a 
single step added to an automated procedure. You could have a link in 
"Old" as requested, and any other links as well.
