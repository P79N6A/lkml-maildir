Please refer to my IDE freeze patch last week:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/25/140
It provides userspace with a method to freeze the queue and park the
head (through sysfs), along with a timeout to unfreeze, and works
quite well. It is in the process of being moved to the block layer
however so that implementation for libata will be simpler.
