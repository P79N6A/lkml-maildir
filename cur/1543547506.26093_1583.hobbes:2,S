No, there are no PCI bus reads.
read/recv block while the NIC DMAs into user space main memory.
(Can't DMA earlier because we don't know the buffer address in advance
when using the standard socket API).
The NIC memory is never accessed directly.  It's a cache of skbuff data
payloads, and the only access is by DMA, in those places where the
kernel stack normally does copy_to_user/copy_from_user.
