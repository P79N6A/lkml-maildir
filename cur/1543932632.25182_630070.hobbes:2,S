I suspect the manufacturers would say "Oh, the sensors?  The BIOS
isn't broken, you're just supposed to use WMI or some (undocumented)
ACPI device to get at those."
I know next to nothing about WMI, and there are probably IP issues
in that area.  But I'd rather spend effort in figuring out the "right"
way to do this.  Until we do it the same way as Windows, we can pile
on hacks till the cows come home, and we'll still have issues.
I added Carlos to the cc: list because he's been doing a lot of
interesting-looking work on WMI.

Windows apparently doesn't reject those resource declarations, so I'm
a bit hesitant to do it in Linux.  That tends to cover up problems,
and then it becomes very difficult to remove the band-aid and figure
out a correct fix in the future.
