Hmm, this invalidated my assumption that write_gdt_entry is always a
write to this cpu's active gdt.  Better fix is not to call it twice
anyway...

Makes sense.

Indeed.

Getting rid of the call in smp_prepare_boot_cpu currently works, but
it's fragile:  __get_cpu_var(x) && per_cpu(x, smp_processor_id()) will
differ, and changes made to __get_cpu_var(x) will vanish...
Fortunately, UP doesn't have to call init_gdt at all, so I think it's
better to place it in smp_prepare_boot_cpu only and then clean up the UP
code.  I'll try now...
