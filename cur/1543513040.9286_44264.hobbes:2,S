There are probably lots of printers that USB
does not yet support well.

I quickly searched for this desc. type and didn't find it.
Does anyone know what it is?
In any case, if we don't recognize it, we need to skip it
gracefully or cause an error, not reference *(5).

Seems to bomb in hub code, not printer code.
Is your printer attached thru an external hub?
If so, would you try it with your printer connected
directly to your PC's USB port(s), and remove the external
hub completely (if you have one).
