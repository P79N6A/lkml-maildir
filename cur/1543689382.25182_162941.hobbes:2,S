I'm looking after a box with EPoX 8K9A2+ board (IIRC), with KT400 chip
set.  Booting with ACPI enabled (i. e. no acpi=off in kernel command
line) makes most interrupts (network, disk) invisible. acpi=off fixes
this. I haven't bothered to report this because it's running some
SuSE-patched 2.4.20 kernel (they did patch newer ACPI, "Subsystem
revision 20030228").
Is testing a newer kernel or ACPI stuff worthwhile or should I wait?
It's a production machine, so "see if this works" is out of the game,
"it should work" can be tested in times of low load but not necessarily
on short notice.
Is this any help?
