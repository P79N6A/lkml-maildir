On the contrary. The above shows that the client is indeed receiving
some data, but for some reason it is not accepting that data as a
valid reply. It looks as if either skb_recv_datagram() or
xprt_lookup_rqst() is failing.
BTW: I'm still not seeing any such trouble with these loopback mounts
on my own machine. Could it be an SMP problem?
Cheers,
