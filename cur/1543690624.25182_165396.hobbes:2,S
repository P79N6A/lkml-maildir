I like this a _lot_, it is something I have thought about doing, and
something we have a need for at MontaVista.
But I think its a lot more useful if we have alternative overcommit
modes to use with it.
An oom_nop might be a good idea.  But some different policies, i.e. ones
with more determinism but less smarts, are interesting.
