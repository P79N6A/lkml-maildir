Developpers need complete sources.  No questions about that.  If they
don't have the complete sources, they'll fuck things up.  So the
developpers have zero use for partial downloadings.
Some users may like to be able to download only the core code and
drivers/filesystems/architectures they use.  Ignoring the obvious
version drift problems that will happen, proposing such a service
requires work and a large amount of bandwidth.  Do you volunteer?
  OG.
