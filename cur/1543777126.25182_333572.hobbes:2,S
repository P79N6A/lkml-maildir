And, conversely, if any one of them makes sense, they all do.  Well,
with the exception that some of them have never, ever been used before,
and that's what we should be aiming for.  No conflicts with existing
programs, then new programs can be written to avoid conflicting with us.

Agreed, but not one to be taken too lightly.

I like using @, though.  Without having to escape it.
That's why we're trying to find something that people won't actually
touch, especially since if we design it right, this will be the last
delimiter introduced at the fs/vfs level.

.....if bugs were seen as such a big deal.
I think it's far easier to get into the kernel with something
ludicrously buggy than something which actually changes fundamental
behavior.  That is, you can put in an FS which actually corrupts data
(such as the old NTFS write support), so long as it doesn't break POSIX,
or cause other weird restrictions like "No files named 'metas'"
Now, if we can decide that we don't care about being in the vanilla
kernel, then we can just call it ".metas" or "lost+found" or whatever
and get to work on bug fixes and other much-needed features such as a
repacker.
