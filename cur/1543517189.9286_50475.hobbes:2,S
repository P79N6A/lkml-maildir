Subject: 2.3.29: hang after "booting", before banner (single K6-200 192M)

When booting 2.3.29, my system hangs after the initial "booting" message, but
before the banner is printed.  It's a single processor K6-200 system w/192M
RAM.  It runs 2.2.10 fine.
Has anyone else seen this or found any clues?  (I've already tried specifying
different mem= values.)
As far as tracking it down, I'm thinking of a binary search through the 2.3
series to find the first rev that breaks.  Is there a better way?
Thanks,
--Mike
