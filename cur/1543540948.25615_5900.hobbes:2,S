Um, I'm pretty sure it's not my posting you read.
The current status of 32-bit uid support is that while much of the
infrastructure is there, the work wasn't completed.  Note that in
arch/i386/config.in, CONFIG_UID16 is hardcoded to "yes".  I haven't been
tracking the 32-bit uid work, so I'm not sure what's still left to be
done on the i386 side.  I've cc'ed the linux-kernel mailing list in case
someone wants to comment.....
I do think it would be a good idea if we could get these interfaces
working before 2.4 shipped; I'm assuming there can't be that much work
left, right?
