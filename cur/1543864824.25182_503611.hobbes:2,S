please do these two changes in at least two separate phases. Like for 
the timer.c code movement i'd not do the big code shuffling just now, 
and even if it's done, it should be a /pure/ movement, with all 
preparatory and post changes done in separate patches. That way the 
individual changes are much more reviewable.
