This looks fine so far except that we don't know if the settings in 
the .config-file match your computers hardware and needs.

This is NOT a kernel error message.
This message is printed by the shellscript /etc/init.d/net.eth0 which is 
started by init.
Maybe there is no module for eth0 loaded? Log in as root and try 
dhcpcd eth0
What happens? What error message do you get? Fix that.

As I said above - this is NOT a kernel error. Maybe there's a missing module, 
but the would depend on your kernel configuration or 
on /etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.4 (load the right modules on startup).
If you have further questions concerning this error and / or gentoo linux look 
at the forums at forums.gentoo.org or contact me directly. Don't bother the 
LKML with this.
Greets,
Manuel
