The question is probably not that much kernel-related, but I couldn't find
anything useful on the net and don't I think the other news groups in the other
news groups this will be more offtopic than in this.
Is there any way to use something like loadlin from linux (don't reply yet, wait
for the details). What I want is to make an install disk, which boots into a
minimal linux, then scans all disks/CD-ROM/(maybe network) for an installable
linux version and then boots this version so that it get installed. This means
that it has to overwrite the kernel because the distribution to install will
maybe contain already a newer kernel. So it has similar things to do loadlin
does when it boots linux by overwriting a running windows.
Another interesting use would be to have a read-only bootimage (maybe on a
floppy) to boot linux, then check all file systems on the disk and if all is
fine overwrite myself by executing the bootsector (e.g. LILO) which then will
continue with booting the real linux. If the disk check fails (root partition
might be corrupt, disk might be damaged...) I could continue the boot process
from the read-only medium and go into a kind of maintance mode (and for instance
initialize a modem, notify a remote admin and wait for him to log in from
outside and try to solve the problem).
