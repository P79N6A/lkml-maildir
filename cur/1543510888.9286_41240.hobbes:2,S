Hello,
I've notived there were some discusions going on about ACLs very
recently but I didn't find the time to catch up. So, in brief:
I've implemented ACLs both at the VFS layer and for Ext2. Those two
pieces are pretty separate.
ACL support is a mount option, once the kernel has been rebuilt
properly. i386 only so far.
Anybody interested, please take a look:

(There's also some documentation.)
Cheers,
Andreas
