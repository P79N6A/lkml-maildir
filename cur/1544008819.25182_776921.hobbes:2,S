It's always been so, predates me. Pretty ugly, I don't think anyone
would mind if that was changed to be per-device when the ioctl is ussed
:-)

Yep, not sure what you want me to say here...

Most of the above are long known issues with not counting
write/non-write/ioctls opens, since it was tricky/impossible to do
because of fcntl().

Hmm weird, you are right. The member was added in 2.6.2, but never used
except here. I guess this just needs to use opened_for_data.
