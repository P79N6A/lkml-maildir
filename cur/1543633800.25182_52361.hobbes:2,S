Yeah, the above explanation of 'lock' is wrong. It merely controls
whether the tray should be locked when someone is using the CD-ROM. If
noone is using it, it will still be unlocked. There _is_ a var that
controls permanent locking, however it isn't exported through proc.
You'll have to use the CDROM_LOCKDOOR ioctl.
