What do you mean "minors"?  Addresses or actual /dev/sdN numbers?
If it's addresses, that would be an an enumeration problem.  Some
recent changes have caused prolems there, 2.6.11-rc3-mm2 ought to
have a patch making it better.  (Well, working around one of the
two problems that'd suggest.)
If it's actual /dev/sdN numbers, that would seem to be an issue
more at the level of usb-storage.  Quite possibly related to the
bugs you didn't exactly detail (below).
