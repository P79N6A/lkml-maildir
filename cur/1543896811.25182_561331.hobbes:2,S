uhm, i dont think Steve needs to 'convince' you. You have been (once 
again ...) given extensive explanations about a really trivial topic, 
but you keep pushing and demanding very agressively without apparently 
reading the answers. If you dont want to or cannot understand it's 
really your problem to solve, not Steve's ...
