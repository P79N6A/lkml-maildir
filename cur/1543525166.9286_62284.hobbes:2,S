I don't believe that the problem described is in devfs.  It was introduced
some time after 2.3.35 in the reworking of the block device interface.
With the patches below, I can boot an initrd/ramdisk system using 2.3.42
with devfs, and it appears to run properly.
PLEASE note the following:
1. There is some kind of recent breakage of ramdisk that this does not
   completely fix.  The symptom is that __sometimes__ files in the page
   cache are not flushed to the ramdisk buffer cache.  Sometimes it works
   correctly.
2. The patch for initrd reading/writing is a hybrid of my earlier version
   and the one from Mike Galbraith, as mine was incomplete.
3. This patch kludges out the effect of the recent "invalidate device
   buffers on the final close" that destroys ramdisks.
4. Since it is 5AM, I can't remember what else I should mention here.
