as a quick workaround, it's more or less safe to fix this up in
user-space, just do this in a root process:
#include <asm/io.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#define HZ 100
#define LATCH  ((CLOCK_TICK_RATE + HZ/2) / HZ)
#define CLOCK_TICK_RATE 1193180
main()
{
	iopl(3);
        /* set the clock to 100 Hz */
        outb(0x34,0x43);
        outb(LATCH & 0xff , 0x40);    /* LSB */
        outb(LATCH >> 8 , 0x40);        /* MSB */
}
(compile it with -O2. i have not actually tested or compiled this)
