I suggest that you may __think__ that there is no router.... But
for instance, I can't talk to my own printer here because
of some configuration changes made by the "Net Naz^M^M^M
Wizards" here. Same network, same wire. It gets "redirected".
Basically, everything on this wire is proxy-arped by the
default-route machine. There are duplicate packets on the
wire and redirections everywhere.
You can look at your ARP table with:
`cat /proc/net/arp`

The `ping -r` working shows that there were is either a bad
ARP table entry or too small a netmask so the device isn't
really on your network.

Just check it out. You'd be surprised what you may find.
Look at the ARP-table entry. Try to ping something that
doesn't respond. Look at the table again. That will tell
you what's happening. It's likely that there is an ARP
table entry from some 'router' that has been set to
proxy-ARP whatever it sees on the wire.
