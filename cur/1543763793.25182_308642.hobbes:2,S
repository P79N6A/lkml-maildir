So, just for clarification, since a S_ISSOCK test is not necessarily
equivalent to an i_sock test (in the case of inodes of socket files in
the filesystem), was removing i_sock truly the right choice?  It may not
be an issue for typical users of i_sock since you can't open a
descriptor to such a socket file, so any code that was acting on an open
file shouldn't have to deal with this ambiguity, but could possibly lead
to an erroneous use of SOCKET_I on the inode of a socket file in other
code (which is what would have happened in SELinux if we had just
changed the i_sock test to an ISSOCK test).  Thanks, just trying to
avoid confusion in the kernel in the future...
