Things are never that simple.  But I was basically talking about a local 
policy to change the (semantics of the) API in certain cases.  It's 
probably a bad idea and would cause all kinds of breakage, but it is 
interesting to think about.

I wasn't aware of the current status.  Ok, that's just where it's at.

That's my particular kind of crazy idea.
