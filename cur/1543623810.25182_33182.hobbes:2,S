The development speed and code quality of -rmap have also gone
up as a consequence of moving over to bitkeeper.
Merging patches up to a new version of the kernel has gone from
tiring (with patch and vi) to almost relaxing (with bitkeeper's
automatic and graphical 2-way merge tools)...
This in turn has allowed me to spend my time and energy on
improving the code, without having to fear large patches and
the maintenance those require.
regards,
Rik
