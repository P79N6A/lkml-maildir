Subject: [PATCH] highres/dyntick: prevent xtime lock contention
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/13/190

While the !highres/!dyntick code assigns the duty of the do_timer() call
to one specific CPU, this was dropped in the highres/dyntick part during
development.
Steven Rostedt discovered the xtime lock contention on highres/dyntick
due to several CPUs trying to update jiffies.
Add the single CPU assignement back. In the dyntick case this needs to
be handled carefully, as the CPU which has the do_timer() duty must drop
the assignement and let it be grabbed by another CPU, which is active.
Otherwise the do_timer() calls would not happen during the long sleep.
