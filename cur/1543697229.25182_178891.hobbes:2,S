I don't have that problem, luckily, but a different one...

Sometimes kernel doesn't want to recognize the SM card in reader, and I
have to reinsert it, sometimes several times.  In 2.4, one `eject
/dev/sda` fixes the problem, in 2.6 not any more.  But reinserting
always helps... obviously, not ideal too, but it works for me.
