That overhead is mostly gone in current glibcs (when using NPTL):
a) e.g. locking is done unconditionally even when libpthread is not present
   (it is just lock cmpxchgl, inlined)
b) things like cancellation aware syscall wrappers for cancellable syscalls
   and various other things are only done after first pthread_create has
   been called, it doesn't matter whether libpthread is loaded or not
