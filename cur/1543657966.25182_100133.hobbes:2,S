A closer look on the patch reveals that the lines causing
trouble for you are in fact new:
http://www.kernel.org/diff/diffview.cgi?css=
%2Fdiff%2Fdiff.css;file=%2Fpub%2Flinux%2Fkernel%2Fv2.5%2Fpatch-2.5.54.gz;z=65
And so are the fields being manipulated:
http://www.kernel.org/diff/diffview.cgi?css=
%2Fdiff%2Fdiff.css;file=%2Fpub%2Flinux%2Fkernel%2Fv2.5%2Fpatch-2.5.54.gz;z=862
Could the compiler somehow be using headers from the
wrong location? (Just a wild guess)
