Allan, disabling EHCI in kernel won't solve it cause the kernel
freezes when linux is setting up pci. This is before any device
specific driver and it is done even without any driver for that
device.
I was going to implement a way to ignore using bus+board+function but
not at this time. BTW, are the parameters name, format and debug
messages adequated to kernel's principels?
