If you look at the numbers that I posted earlier then you will see that 
even the measurements without free were not up to par.

Which one is that?

There is a consistent loss on slab_free it seems. The 16k numbers are 
irrelevant since we do not use slab_alloc/slab_free due to the direct pass 
through patch but call the page allocator directly. That also explains 
that there is no loss there.
The kmalloc numbers look encouraging. I will check to see if I can 
reproduce it once I sort out the patches.
