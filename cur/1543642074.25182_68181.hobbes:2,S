After changing the IP's of two machine the routing of one ethernet goes down.
(Destination host Unreachable)
HOST A                           HOST B
xxx.xxx.xxx.154   <--  hub   --> xxx.xxx.xxx.148
192.168.100.154   <-- switch --> 192.168.100.148
on host A:
rsync -e ssh backup@xxx.xxx.xxx.148 (files) OK no prob
ssh 192.168.100.148 (OK no prob, I can login and do everything)
rsync -e ssh backup@192.168.100.148 (files) Problem.
On the last command I get a respons from the ethernet-card of host A that the network cannot be reached.
It still possible to ping to that ethernet-card (so the card is not down), if I look in the routing (route -C) I see no problem.
Because all the other connections seems fine, I have no idea where to look.
(allready changed all the network-cards, cables, the switch and the hub)
Best regards,
Pascal
