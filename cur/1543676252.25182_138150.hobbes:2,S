In the memset cases, what fixed the panic was that the size of the
raw_mbox automatic was set to 16 and the memset was using
sizeof(mbox_t).  I just increased the size of the raw_mbox so it
wouldn't be overflowed.  It sounds like, from what you are saying, that
the size of raw_mbox should have been left at 16 and the memset changed
to fill 16 bytes and not the sizeof(mbox_t).

This doesn't seem like it would hurt since issue_scb sets mbox->busy
just after the memcpy. and in issue_scb_block, the raw_mbox busy
location is set before the memcpy.
