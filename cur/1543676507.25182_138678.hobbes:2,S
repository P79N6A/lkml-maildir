Thanks, but please avoid doing things like this:

The problem here is that "buf" has the wrong type, and you're hiding it 
with a cast.
That's pointless - yes, it avoids a warning from "check", but the thing 
is, that warning was _correct_, and you just hid the problem.
If "buf" really is a user pointer, then it should have been marked that 
way in the first place.
I understand why you did it the way you did: the tty functions are badly 
designed, and the same function is used for both user and kernel pointers.
And that's something that check does and _should_ warn about. The function 
definition is crap, and I'd rather have the warning there and hope some 
tty layer person comes along and makes the user/kernel case into separate 
functions (they don't share that much code anyway, since most of the 
function is
	if (from_user) {
		user case
	} else {
		kernel case
	}
anyway.
I hate these kinds of "flag" arguments anyway. If a function does two
different things, it should be two different functions. Yeah, I know, the
"gfp_mask" thing for the memory allocators are the same way, and yeah,
that was a design mistake too.
