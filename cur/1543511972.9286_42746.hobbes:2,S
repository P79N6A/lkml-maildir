Just HOW does having devfs in the kernel have an impact on all drivers,
apart from the source? Devfs as implemented now, has threee features for
people who can not accept how it does things.
1.) You don't have to configure it into the kernel at all (no code
compiled in, thus no effect; old-style devices are used)
2.) Devfs support is compiled in, but devfs isn't mounted (old-style
devices are used)
3.) Devfs support is compiled in, and devfs is mounted in backwards-
compatible mode.
You'd probably want option 1, to be sure nothing new pollute your pure 
idea of devices.
Most distributions would probably compile devfs into the kernel, but
default not to mount it and have it an install-option.

Have you had a look at the devfs patch to see how much it really
influences?
