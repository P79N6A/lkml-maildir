Not that I would recommend the binary nvidia driver, but:
You can probably get bttv to work despite this overlay bug by using 
"grabdisplay" mode instead.  There is an option for it in xawtv.  The 
difference is, in overlay mode, the capture card is writing directly to 
videoram.  Using grabdisplay mode eliminates this optimization, and 
would be a decent workaround for you.
Hope this helps,
Michael
