Sorry about I have a little hurry about it.
The original RapidIO driver suppose there is only one mpc85xx RIO
controller
in system. So, some data structures are defined as mpc85xx_rio global,
such as 'regs_win', 'dbell_ring', 'msg_tx_ring'. Now, I changed them to
mport's private members. And you can define multi RIO OF-nodes in dts
file
for multi RapidIO controller in one processor, such as PCI/PCI-Ex host
controllers
in Freescale's silicon. And the mport operation function declaration
should be changed
to know which RapidIO controller is target.
Thanks!
