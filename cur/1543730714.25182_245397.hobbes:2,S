  This last sentence makes me wonder. Where is Linux heading? The idea
  that   a  FS  cannot  contain  features that no other FS has is very
  scary.
  I  am  all  for  uniformity, but not at the expense of shutting down
  advanced progress that Linux is so badly needing.
  This talk about old UNIX seems like people want to still live in the
  70'ies and not look forward. Please wake up!
