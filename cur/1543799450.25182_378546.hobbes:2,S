It is expected that the boot loader provide a flat device tree to the  
kernel.  I'm not aware of anyone working on a wrapper to provide a  
flat device tree.  Do realize there are tools like DTC that will  
produce a device tree blob based on an input file.  This blob can  
than be handed to the kernel.
Take a look at:
http://ozlabs.org/git?p=dtc.git;a=summary
and
Documentation/booting-without-of.txt (in DTC) which talks about what  
arch/powerpc expects from the bootloader.
