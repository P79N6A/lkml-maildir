   Just to pick nits... my example went from 2 or 3 IOs [depending on the 
   presence/absence of a work loop] to 6 IOs.
   
I mean "2 extra PIOs" not "2 total PIOs".
I think it's doable for just about every driver, even tg3 with it's
weird semaphore scheme takes 2 extra PIOs worst case with NAPI.
The semaphore I have to ACK anyways at hw IRQ time anyways, and since
I keep a software copy of the IRQ masking register, mask and unmask
are each one PIO.
