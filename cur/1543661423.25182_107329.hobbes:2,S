Makes a lot of sense.

The compiler has a hard time to identify those loops that affect
performance as opposed to those that are run 2-3 times.
But the developer can usually profile and figure out, where those
loops are. I wonder if the following would be possible.
printf();
__cacheline_aligned_code;
for(;;)
	do_sorting_loop_test();
include/linux/cache.h appears to define such for data structures, but
not for code.
