That will be much appreciated. ACPI is not all that wonderful to say the
least. With enough knowledge of the hardware you can mostly do a better
job (the problem is "enough knowledge", especially on most laptops where
most of the GPIO signals etc are pretty much ad-hoc and not defined by the
chipsets but by the board layout person.. And we can't query the board
revision even if they gave us the information ;)
