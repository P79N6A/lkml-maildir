	Who knows, perhaps there's a public domain interface that wraps linux
kernel function calls into bsd functions, so you can always "successfully"
argue the source code is not only for Linux. However, I think that precompiled
.ko files are _much more_ tied to Linux (in short, supporting your point) plus
a specific architecture.
