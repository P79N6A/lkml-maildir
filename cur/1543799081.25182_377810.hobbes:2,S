Ingo, this is to prevent a kernel hang due to application error.
Basically when an application does a pthread_mutex_lock twice on a
_nonrecursive_ mutex with robust/PI attributes the whole system hangs.
Ofcourse the application clearly should not be doing anything like
that, but it should not end up hanging the system either
