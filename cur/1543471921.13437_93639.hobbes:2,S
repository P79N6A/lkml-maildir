From my very old TASM quick reference:
OR AX,AX -> Sets flags
MOV DI,DI -> Doesn't set flags (ALL MOV's doesn't affect the status)
XCHG AX, AX (opcode 0x90) was used as a synonym of NOP (NOP was/is
accepted as NOP -- at least by TASM and is assembled as XCHG AX,AX)
XCHG doesn't set flags so it's good
BUT, something should be wrong in my manual: XCHG is rated for 3 clock
ticks on a 486 (Pentium weren't invented yet...) but his 'synonym' NOP
is rated for only 1 tick....
