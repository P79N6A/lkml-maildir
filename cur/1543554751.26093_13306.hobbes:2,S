BTW, what do you think of a new PCI style probing for SBUS?
When I hacked on a small sbus driver, I thought it might be a good idea
to have tables like the new PCI interface for all busses.
The interface for SBUS would be:
struct sbus_device_id {
	char *		promname;
	unsigned long	driver_data;
};
struct sbus_driver {
	struct list_head	node;
	char *			name;
	struct sbus_device_id *	id_table;
	int (* probe)(struct sbus_dev * dev, const struct sbus_device_id * id);
	void (* remove)(struct sbus_dev * dev);
};
Would you accept such a change for 2.5?
	Christoph
