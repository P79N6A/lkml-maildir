I've heard of several MTRR issues with 2.6.x, of which this is likely
an instance.
The pattern seemed to involve attempts to cover the final portion of
RAM with numerous fragments decreasing in size with ascending
physical address, and failure to cover the final 4-8MB RAM. Odder
still, the affected systems seemed to only have 1GB RAM, and for some
reason 2.4.x was not affected.
I've walked about 3 or 4 users through manually correcting the MTRR
settings over the past 2 weeks.
