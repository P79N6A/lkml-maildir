Just an update to my situation... I've implemented my idea of clearing the
associated PTE's when I need to free the DMA buffer, then re-filling them in
nopage(). This seems to work fine; if the user process tries anything fishy,
it gets a SIGBUS instead of accessing the old mapping.
I encountered two difficulties with the implementation:
1) zap_page_range(), flush_cache_range(), and flush_tlb_range() are not
exported to drivers. I basically copied the guts of zap_page_range() into my
driver, which seems to work OK on x86, but I know it will have trouble with
architectures that require special treatment of PTE manipulation...
2) the state of mm->mmap_sem is unknown when my file_operations->release()
function is called. If release() is called when the last FD closes, then
mm->mmap_sem is not taken. But if release() is called from do_munmap, then
mmap_sem has already been taken. So, it is risky to mess with vma's inside
of release()...
