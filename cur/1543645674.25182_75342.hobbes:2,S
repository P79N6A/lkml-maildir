Having the working set of one process larger than RAM is
a highly unusual case ...

... page replacement ought to give this process less RAM
because it isn't going to get enough to run anyway. No need
to have a process like qsbench make other processes run
slow, too.

The difference there is that desktops don't have a working
set larger than RAM. They've got a few (dozen?) of processes,
each of which has a working set that easily fits in ram and
a bunch of pages, or whole processes, which aren't currently
in use.
In this situation the VM _can_ keep the whole working set in
RAM, simply by evicting the stuff that's not in the working
set.

As you write above, it's a pretty damn important feature,
though.  One thing I'm experimenting with now for 2.4 rmap
is to ignore the referenced bit and page age if a page is
only in use by processes which haven't run recently, this
should help the desktop (and university) workloads by
swapping out memory from tasks which don't need it anyway
at the moment.
There may be other modifications needed, too...

Rik
