2.4 does not report iowait; all iowait is reported as idle time on 2.4.

Well, it looks like Linus said various things along these lines in
various ways before I finished writing this, but in case hearing it a
second time is any reassurance:
There's a slight problem here in that you're io-bound, not cpu-bound,
so profiles won't actually tell us much about remaining overheads.
One thing here is that since turning off all the debugging options got
you down to about a 15% degradation, things aren't actually
looking anywhere near as problematic as before when you had a near 90%
degradation. One possible explanation is that the extensive padding
done by CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC created significant memory pressure.
If you'd like further speedups, logging the things I suggested earlier
and trying fiddling with swappiness might help.
In fact, you are down to such a small margin of degradation that the
remaining degradation vs. 2.4 may in fact be due to using oprofile,
which has significant, though not overwhelming overhead.
