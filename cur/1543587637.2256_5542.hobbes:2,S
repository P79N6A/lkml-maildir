So it's stable ;))

I never heard about this problem.  What would be helpful is to
send a few minutes' (a full 'load cycle'?) worth of output from
'vmstat 5' and some information about the configuration of the
machine.
It's possible I'll want more information later, but just the
vmstat output would be a good start.
If the data isn't too big, I'd appreciate it if you could also
CC linux-mm@kvack.org.
regards,
Rik
