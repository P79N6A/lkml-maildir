F:	drivers/ata/
There is a SATA-promise maintainer
        PROMISE SATA TX2/TX4 CONTROLLER LIBATA DRIVER
        P:	Mikael Pettersson
        M:	mikpe@it.uu.se
        L:	linux-ide@vger.kernel.org
        S:	Maintained
        F:	drivers/ata/sata_promise.*
maybe there should be an entry to exclude
this maintained driver too?
X:	drivers/ata/sata_promise.*
cheers,  Joe
