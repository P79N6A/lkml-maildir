Pretty much all of it is modules. The base system is openSUSE 10.2, and
SuSE has a long habit of building everything as modules and putting the
drivers needed for accessing the root filesystem into an initrd. I have
fought it for a while but nowadays I'm playing along.
So yes, all of ahci, pata_marvell, aic7xxx, jbd, dm_mod, ext3 are in
fact modules in initrd. Would it help to try a kernel with some or all
of these built in?

In which place? I installed and successfully ran the Xen packages that
came with openSUSE 10.2, so there is a 2.6.18 kernel with SuSE's Xen
patches on the machine. But that shouldn't have any influence on the
kernel.org kernels I build myself, should it?

It has the "+=" variant.

"Before" and "after" meaning with CONFIG_XEN=n and CONFIG_XEN=y, I
suppose. The resulting logs are a bit biggish, so I have put them on
http://www.phnxsoft.com/~ts/linux/
 for download. Let me know if you
prefer having them mailed.
