Yeah ? And then you need to wait for LONG time while committee will be
formed, new protocol will be approved and so on ? And then if can add
new feature (like auto-powersaving) you can not do so before committee
will approve such new feature ? Sorry. Users can not wait (if product is
indeed needed; otherwise they will not buy it). Later when standard will
define standard commands for this features you can change new versions of
products to be compatible with standard. Or you can even ussie firmware
upgrade to make product compatible with standard (think about modems:
28.800 modems existed before V.34 standard, 56.000 modems existed ebfore
V.90 standard and so on).

Sorry. For vendor delivering product is MUCH more important then new
standards development (for linux distributions as well).

This is extreme example but for less extrime example it happens all the time.
libqt can be QT library or Qthreads (library from old Guile releases), pc
can be "Pizza compiler" (from old version of Kaffe) or "Pascal Compiler"
(from old version of GPC) and so on. Samples are countless. Usually with
time consensus is found (libqt from guile is now libqthread, pc from
GPC is now `gpc --standard-pascal' and so on). But if we tried to standartize
evefything first and try to write code only after then then we had only a lot
of papers about "future great GNU system", "future great BSD system" and
other "future great systems" by now and used Windows (due lack of choice).
Even more: when standard is developed it's still typical to produce new
systems not compatible with standard for YEARS (standard place for info pages
is /usr/share/info for FEW YEARS: how many distributions install them there?).
If you REALLY think it's way to go then stop using PC, stop using Linux and
go to develop "perfect system" in your ivory tower. We have no luxury to do
so: we need things to be done HERE AND NOW, not some 10 years later when
all needed standards will be there.

And then go out of business since when standard will be finished your company
will be bancrupt for year or few (or you'll be able to convince everyone to
wait for standard scanners will not be available till 2010 when this standard
will be finished). Great way.

And this is STUPID WAY. IDE and SCSI devices have more memory then my first PC.
It's MORE then enough resources to do all checking in hardware. No need to
teach ATA-* driver, no need to update kernel when you'll plug new hardware.
