Hi,
  I was doing my "compile everything possible as modules" thing
again, and noticed some weird warning..
Turns out that  drivers/block/cpqarray.c  has a typo:
( in /usr/src/linux directory )
$ cc=`find * -name \*.c`
$ egrep CONFIG_PROCFS $cc
drivers/block/cpqarray.c:#ifdef CONFIG_PROCFS
drivers/block/cpqarray.c:#ifdef CONFIG_PROCFS
$ hh=`find * -name \*.h`
$ SS=`find * -name \*.S`
$ egrep CONFIG_PROCFS $hh
$ egrep CONFIG_PROCFS $SS
$
The thing to test is  CONFIG_PROC_FS  ...
As a side note, job for a aspiring kernel hacker:
In the system (for i386) there are now  565  'CONFIG_.*' entries and
TWO 'IDEDMA_.*' entries.  Scanning the system for such defines which
are *NOT* defined in any configuration script file would be worthwhile
job for somebody.   Any takers ?
If somebody makes tools to automate such scan, could they, please, be
published ?
