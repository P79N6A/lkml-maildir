I'm using a Rocket port 8port ISA card with linux kernel version 2.2.5.  I
haven't had any problems with it until the machine it's in was upgraded to
a dual processor and I recompiled 2.2.5 with smp enabled.
Now I am experiencing wierd intermittant problems and before I go chasing
some butterflies, I'm just wondering if I'm shooting myself in the foot by
using an SMP kernel with non-smp drivers..
Thanks!
