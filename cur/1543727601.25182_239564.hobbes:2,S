Well... I did consider that. And not to disbelieve you, since you know 
the kernel way better than I do, But decided I was being silly that a 
1.6GHz Pentium-M processor should use 100% CPU moving a couple of 
MB/second across a CF interface...
Is 100% CPU not excessive? IIRC my PIII-750 used to use less CPU doing 
the same job as quick, or even slightly faster...
And should it not use system CPU rather than user CPU?
TIA
 Hamish.
