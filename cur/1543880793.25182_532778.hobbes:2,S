Agreed - I was talking about a quick way to hack a real filesystem
in to the VM to start exercising the new VM code without needing to
implement compound page support down the whole I/O stack. 
Any sort of hack we do like this will be throwaway code, but we're
going to need something to start with. I'll leave it up to ppl know
know much more about the block layer than I do to decide how to
do this properly.... ;)
Cheers,
