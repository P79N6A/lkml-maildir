A quick round of googling brings up this
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0410.3/0205.html
 where the issue was that binutils were too old to compile the
 newer kernels. More generically, RH9 is now really ancient,
 and you'd probably make your life much easier by upgrading
 to more recent distributions.
If you intend to stay on RH9, please have a look at the
 /usr/src/linux/Documentation/Changes file, it will give you
 a first idea of how much stuff you need to upgrade on RH9.
