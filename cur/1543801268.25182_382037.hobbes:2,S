Not really something we want to do at Oops time and even if the kernel
was in a sane enough state to actually do it you've just increased the
amount of work needing to be done to decode the Oops by everyone
recieving/wanting to read it.
I think a better idea is to try and move things around so the most
useful pieces of information are on the last lines of the Oops output
(most likely to not have scrolled off the screen) and also work to
elliminate lines that are not really useful/helpful and maybe try to
cram more info from multiple short lines into a single line.
