Suspending how ? via signal ?  
Possibly, but having an explicit syscall() call is important since interrupts
are also suspended under that condition, pthread_cond_timedwait(), etc...
It really needs to be suspended in a way that's different than the SIGSOMETHING
mechanism. I was fixing bugs in libc_r, so I know the issues to a certain degree
and bad logic those particular corner cases was screwing me up.
