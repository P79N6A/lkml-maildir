But you are adding the read to a function that is called repeatedly to 
fix an event that happens only once at start-up !
If this read is really needed (I still doubt it...), can't it be 
performed in vortex_up(), by possibly doubling the existing one there ?
vortex_up() is executed only once at start-up, not every 60 seconds.

Hah, a Cisco switch.  Look in Documentation/networking/vortex.txt for 
"portfast".
