your patch does not solve the problem, the situation is more complex. What
happens if the target task is not 'current' and is running on some other
CPU? If we send the migration interrupt then nothing guarantees that the
task will reschedule anytime soon, so the target CPU will keep spinning
indefinitely. There are other problems too, like crossing calls to
set_cpus_allowed(), etc. Right now set_cpus_allowed() can only be used for
the current task, and must be used by kernel code that knows what it does.
i've put a BUG() into set_cpus_allowed() that prevents 'wrong' usage.

for debugging you can export it temporarily. Otherwise i consider it a
feature that no scheduler internals are visible externally in any way.
