I wasn't (yet) able to apply your patch (there were some errors and I'm 
not so firm about patching files manually). I don't have physical access 
to that computer anyway right now. So I'm not able to see any messages 
on it's console. But I applied the 2.6.5rc2-mm4 patch. Still the same 
problem. Linux still crashes after a couple of MBytes have passed the r8169.
Thanks for your effort. Any other idea how to fix that problem (like 
doing things that make r8169 stable while loosing performance)?
TIA
