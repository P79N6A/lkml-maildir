It was more a rhetorical question. If not all drivers can handle it,
serialize at the bus level. But if all drivers can, there's no reason
for the bus to do it. On a bus with a small number of drivers, I
prefer to have the drivers in good shape. (This kind of implies that e.
g. pci needs to serialize, but css/ccw doesn't, and doesn't have to.)

How so? It is possible to do some stuff synchronously. But why
shouldn't other things be done asynchronously?
(And there is a place both for bus-level parallelism and driver-level
parallelism. Just depends on your bus/driver/device.)
