A lot of code was written assuming inline means __always_inline, I'd suggest
keeping that assumption and working on removing inlines that aren't
strictly necessary as there's no way to know what inlines meant 'try to inline'
and what ones really should have been __always_inline.
Not that I feel _that_ strongly about it.
