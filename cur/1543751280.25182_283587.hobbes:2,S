Hello linux-experts,
   I want to find whether a process blocks in a system
call due to the unavailability of the resource that is
accessed in it. For eg, if a semaphore key is not
available to the process while executing the system
calls like read, write etc, it will wait in the
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE state. 
   Now, I don't want the process to simply sleep,
waiting for the semaphore. I want it to be added into
the runqueue again. And also, I want to determine this
in the kernel module. How can I do this? Can anyone
help me regarding this?
 I am intercepting system calls in kernel 2.4.28.
Thanks,
selva
