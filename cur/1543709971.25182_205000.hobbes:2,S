Sounds exactly like ED_UNLINK -- except maybe that it's not
been put onto ed_rm_list (with ED_DEQUEUE set).
Why add another state?
The parts of this patch that came from the one I sent earlier
are obviously correct (what were your test results for that?),
and there's non-worrisome noise (printks etc).
But some parts worry me.  Like changing that code to BUG()
on a driver behavior that's perfectly reasonable; and removing
some of the PCI posting, which makes it easier for the HC
and its driver to disagree about schedule status.

That was my original suspicion, you may recall ... :)
