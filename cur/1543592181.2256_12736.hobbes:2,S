Hi all!
in sk_buff under kernel 2.4.4 there is a struct called skb_shared_info which
lives at the end of the header
data (at skb->end). one of it's fields is : struct sk_buff *frag_list. what
is the purpose for it's existance?
where in the tcp stack can I see the use for it, or where do I fill it? is
there a relation between this field
and the skb_frag_t frags[MAX_SKB_FRAGS] which also belongs to the same
struct and is simply an array
of objects the describe a fragment using page,offset & size?
thanks in advance,
--Alon
