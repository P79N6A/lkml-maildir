I do understand the conditions when the bug happens. Its completely
clear :) Though I do not understand how to trigger it from command line
to test that the problem is resolved. Jeff was not kind enough to give
exact command line :(
The unfortunate thing with this place is that original Eric's code is
also broken here. I was too optimistic working on the original patchset.
In other way, but broken :(
So, I must stop and think...
