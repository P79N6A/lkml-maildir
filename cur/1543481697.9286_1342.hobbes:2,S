I have sysklogd-1.3-26 (that's what the rpm says, though klogd -v says 1.3-3).
It works fine with 2.1.132, but I upgraded a couple of days back to 2.2.0pre9
and now it keeps complaining at boot time. If it is using /proc/kmsg, why the
heck does it seek /dev/kmem? And why can't it find my System.map? It is in
exactly the same place as the 2.1.132 System.map used to be (/usr/src/linux).
My modules are in a nice place, too: /lib/modules/2.2.0-final.
