Finally, some light is shed into one of the most arcane areas of
the kernel ;-) Thanks !

Hmm, given that this description will not only be read by implementers
of atomic functions, but also by users, the "explicit memory barriers"
may be confusing. Who does them, the atomic_* function, or the user ?
In fact, I would call them "implicit", because they're hidden in the
atomic_foo functions :-)

s/smb_/smp/ :-)
Do they also work for atomic_add and atomic_sub, or do we have to
fall back to smb_mb or atomic_add_return (see below) there ?

What happens if the operation could return a value, but the user
ignores it ? E.g. if I don't like smp_mb__*, could I just use
	atomic_inc_and_test(foo);
instead of
	smp_mb__before_atomic_inc();
	atomic_inc(foo);
	smp_mb__after_atomic_dec();
? If yes, is this a good idea ?

Very confusing: the barriers aren't around the routines (that
is something the user would be doing), but around whatever does
the atomic stuff inside them.
