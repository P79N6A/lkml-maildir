Hi all,
In SMACK, some rules are written to a virtual fs file named 
"cipso".
Rule format is
label level[/cat[,cat]]
Under high I/O load we don't recieve the whole rule in one shot.
This means that sometimes the write() operation begins from the 
middle of the rule. Under some conditions, the first rule _letter_
was only recieved while others were recieved in remaining write() 
calls.
Current SMACK versions don't assume fragmented input like above
cases. This means that sometimes bogus rules that does not 
represent users' intent got created.
What is the best way to parse a rule in such hard coditions?
Regards,
