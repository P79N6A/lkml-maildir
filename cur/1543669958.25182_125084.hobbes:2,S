per_cpu data is statically allocated, at compile-time.  And it doesn't work
for modules.
These hashed locks need to be dynamically allocated (one per filesystem) and
they need to work from modules.
And this hashed lock is not a per-cpu thing.  (No locks are!) It just uses
NR_CPUS to decide how big the hash should be.
