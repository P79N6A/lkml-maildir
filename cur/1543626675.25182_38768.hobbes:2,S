IDE is less of a problem normally. In the LinuxBIOS case it may become
measurable, and the initial drive spinup has to occur before the firmware
responds. (If I understand it rightly most of the drive firmware is on
the disk). For the spin up/down the IDE folks put it in the drives which 
makes life much simpler
