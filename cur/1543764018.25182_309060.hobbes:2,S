actually there is a thread about firmware loading rewrite and POST
calling of programs. It must be on LKML or the hotplug mailing list.
However my backlog for the interesting topics of these lists increased
while I was traveling the last 5-6 weeks. I think you should simply
start a new one on LKML.
