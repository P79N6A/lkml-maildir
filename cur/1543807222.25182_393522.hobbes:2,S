OK, it's back.  And this time it's finally in git - tree is on
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/bird.git/
There will be a lot of reordering the patchset (and hopefully flushing
it into mainline) in the next few days, so it's in flux right now.
Composite patch:
ftp://ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/people/viro/patch-2.6.16-rc2-git1-bird1.bz2
URL of splitup: same place, splitup.tar.bz2
A lot of changes - many misc fixes, a lot of endianness annotations,
a couple of new targets added since the last time.  More details when
the things settle down a bit...
