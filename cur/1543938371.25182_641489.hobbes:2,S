Subject: ext4 merge plans for 2.6.25
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The following patches have been in the -mm tree for a while, and I
plan to push them to Linus when the 2.6.25 merge window opens.  With
this patch series, it is expected that ext4 format should be settling
down.  We still have delayed allocation and online defrag which aren't
quite ready to merge, but those shouldn't affect the on-disk format.
I don't expect any other on-disk format changes to show up after this
point, but I've been wrong before....  any such changes would have to
have a Really Good Reason, though.  (No, Abhishek Rai's changes
wouldn't count as an on-disk change, since they change layout choices,
but not anything that e2fsck would actually care about.  We may try
merging those into ext4 and see how they play out in the -mm tree;
we'll see.)

P.S.  Yes, the currently released e2fsprogs won't support all of these
format changes yet; again ext4, shouldn't be deployed to production
systems yet, although we do salute those who are willing to be guinea
pigs and play with this code!  Never fear, I'll be working to get
e2fsprogs caught up Real Soon Now.
