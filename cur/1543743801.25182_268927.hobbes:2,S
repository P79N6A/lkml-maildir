If an in-kernel usage for some of the functions is coming soon simply 
ignore these parts of my patch.
But if there's EXPORT_SYMBOL'ed code since nearly since nearly three 
years in the kernel that has like drivers/acpi/hardware/hwtimer.c 
exactly zero users, the only effect of this code is a code bloat for all 
users of ACPI.
Prehaps #ifdef 0's are the best solution for published but unused 
interfaces?
