Subject: arch/um/sys-i386/setjmp.S: useless #ifdef _REGPARM's?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

arch/um/sys-i386/setjmp.S contains two #ifdef _REGPARM's.
Even if regparm was used in i386 uml (which isn't currently done (why?)),
I don't see _REGPARM being defined anywhere.
Is this a bug waiting for happening when regparm will be used on uml or 
do I miss anything?
