I forgot 2 things: first - it's against 2.6.7 vanillla. Second - there are 
some not-working patches, but the "series" file does not refer to them.
So, 
tar xjf linux-2.6.7.tar.bz2
cd linux-2.6.7
tar xjf uml-patch-2.6.7-01-bb2.tar.bz2
pushpatch 30 (having patch-scripts installed)
is the simplest way to apply it. Without patch-scripts, for each line in 
patch-scripts/series (do grep -v '^#' first to remove comments) apply the 
patch from patch-scripts/patches.
Also, Andrew, why has it not been included in 2.6.7-mm5?
