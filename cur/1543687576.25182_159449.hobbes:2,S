Then one of us screwed up. I've configured everything ACPI I could
find via gconf and there's no sign on CONFIG_ACPI_HT on my .config. I
_do_ have CONFIG_ACPI_BOOT, though, so what to you mean by "mostly"
just an alias.
(And please be gentle, I'm just figuring out ACPI out of necessity
since my new HP ze4400 barely has a BIOS, let alone APM ;)
