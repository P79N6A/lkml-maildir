Indeed - but 49ms is stunning and worthy of investigation. The interesting
thing is that sys_ioctl blankly locks the kernel, even if the systems below
it don't need it. Would be a big change to fix.
In this case, how about adding
	printk(KERN_DEBUG "ioctl cmd=%d\n", cmd);
here in fs/ioctl.c:
	unlock_kernel();
	fput(filp);
out:
		return error;
}
Or something else to instrument ioctl?
