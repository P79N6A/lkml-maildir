Yeah, I can try 2.4.29 later tonight; also, the DVD is not scratched, just 
formatted with Joilet/ISO instead of UDF (which is what should be used on 
DVDs).
However, dd if=/dev/hdh of=file.img
          Even with bs=1 for 1 byte at a time, there seems to be no way to
          get the data off, however...
          With the dd, last time I tried it, it just fails.
          When I use cp to try and copy the file, it freezes the machine.
This is all under 2.6.10 with a Toshiba 16X DVD-ROM (I can get model 
number later.)
