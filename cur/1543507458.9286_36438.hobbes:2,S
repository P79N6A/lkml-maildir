Hi,
I have two probably stupid questions regarding ramdisks:
  1.)  How do I check if a ramdisk is free so I can easily take the first
on which is not allready used by something else.
  2.)  How do I free the memory allocated by a ramdisk.
I've just spend a few secs in the ramdisk code and didn't find any hooks
in the code for this stuff. Is it possible at all?
yours,
 - clifford
