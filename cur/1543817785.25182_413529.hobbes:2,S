That's a shame.

Re verbosity:  do you know that menuconfig search (/) takes regular
expressions?  That could help someone limit the amount of output
from it.
Can you give an example of being too verbose?

The search function of menuconfig (currently) works in the namespace of
CONFIG_ symbols.  It will search for a regex in the symbol tables.
Yes, someone could modify it to search thru the prompt strings of the
symbols.  I don't know if that would help or not.
I have just modified menuconfig search to make displaying the
Selects: and Selected by: output be an option (actually it's a
different search command (\) to not see those lines.
Would that help any regarding verbosity?
The patch is here if you would care to try it:
