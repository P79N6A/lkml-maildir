Me too -- I copied the latest BK tg3.c/tg3.h to my 2.6.8.1 tree and
tried it on my JS20 and it didn't work.  Unfortunately the JS20 blade
only has serial-over-LAN for the console, which also dies as soon as
tg3 gets loaded, so I'm not sure exactly what happened.
    Mike> Is this with or without autonegotiation enabled on the switch?
I believe that the internal ports of the BladeCenter switch are always
locked to full-duplex gigabit operation (ie no autoneg).  In the
switch management GUI, there is a pull-down menu for setting
Speed/Duplex of external ports, but for internal ports to the blades,
there is no menu (just a hard-coded display of 1000/Full).
Thanks,
  Roland
