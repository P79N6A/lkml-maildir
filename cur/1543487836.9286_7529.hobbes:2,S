The kernel has a fixed size stack (8k) regardless of how much physical
memory you have.  Each process has its own kernel mode stack.  Interrupt
contexts use the stack of whatever process is currently running.  This
is one of the major reasons recursion is stricly limited inside the
kernel.  Also you may have a function somewhere allocating large amounts
off the stack.
