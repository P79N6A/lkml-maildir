Your "driver" needs only 6 or so files to work properly, right?  Why not
just create those files under /sys/bus/scsi/ somewhere?  That way you
don't have to create your own fs, and only have to provide read and
write functions for those files, which would be much smaller.
pcihpfs is moving under driverfs soon, once I get some spare cycles.

I'll let the scsi people make that call, I don't know the scsi layer at
