Subject: adjust prefetch in free_one_pgd()

As per an earlier discussion on the lkml, the existing prefetch in
free_one_pgd() is somewhat broken in that it prefetches further than
PREFETCH_STRIDE bytes.  The patch below fixes that.  I'm told that
this also performs better on x86 (it makes little difference on ia64,
but it is also marginally better).
