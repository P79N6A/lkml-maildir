Sorry. The whole thread is about what the kernel does when a process
performs a malloc() (brk() or mmap()). I didn't realize you were talking
of *kernel* allocation.  AFAIK, but haven't checked the Source recently,
you can't page-fault in kernel mode. So every kernel page is valid (mapped
to a page-frame).

Some kernel allocations should succeed even if we're at the low watermark.
That space (page-frames) is "reserved" for kernel use.
I don't think the kernel is interested in using the swap for its own
address space. B-) So no need to reserve some for kernel use.
