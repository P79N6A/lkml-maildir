...You mean like, get them to run './configure' ?[1][2]
...Or installing an RPM with trojanned binaries or install-time scripts,
without checking a signature?[3]
Unfortunately that's all too easy.  Viruses, no.  Malware, you bet.  We
can't get too complacent while laughing at the virus phenomenon.

[2] They don't have to do this as root, either.  If they do it from an
    account that can escalate privileges (i.e. is allowed to su or sudo)
    then it's game over anyway, albeit with more steps.
[3] And of course signatures are useless if the signer was owned first.
    Probably major distros are reasonably safe[4], but not Joe Random who
    produces packages and distributes them...
