Well irq_request is probably a bit late for associating an irq with
a struct device.  And I don't see how to get the device name from that
but making that association wouldn't be a bad thing.

Yes.  But if you can do a good job of wrapping them so a driver
wouldn't need to care at all that could help simplify drivers and
remove one more tidbit of complexity from drivers.
However for a widespread change.  The less you have to think about
it the more quickly you can get it completed.  So I would rather
do several wide spread changes in succession, that I don't have to
think about much to do (i.e.  the change mostly meets the obviously
correct requirement).  Then to do one single change that I have to
think about harder to accomplish.
The more thinking comes into the picture the more you open yourself up
to breaking something by accident because it wasn't clear how the code
should be changed, and the more it slows down the conversion.
Conversions where we have had to think about things are notoriously slow
to complete.  Even if they are a good thing to do.  The examples I can
think of are the kthread API and the DMA api.  Last I checked there
were still a few drivers in the kernel using virt_to_bus...
I don't really get the benefits I'm after unless the conversion can
actually be completed for everything.  So the more I have to think about
any one piece the less I intend to do it.
