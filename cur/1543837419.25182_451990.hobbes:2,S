As creator of the ancient IDE subsystem, I agree --> it is time to get
the next generation code upstream.
This will also allow time for things like "udev" to perhaps think about
an option to someday provide /dev/hd* symlinks for PATA devices when
libata is used instead of IDE (?).  That might be a possible migration
path in the far future.
