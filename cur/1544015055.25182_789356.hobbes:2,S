When I asked last time that was not what I heard. Apparently at least
some --params are considered ready for user consumption these days.

Yes it would basically be a list in the Makefile keyed on compiler
version giving different options and someone would need to do 
the work to do that for each new compiler version.
That would be some work, but it might be less work than going
all over 9.7MLOCs and changing inlines around manually.
Also the advantage is that that you wouldn't need to teach
the rules to hundreds of new driver programmers.
Anyways I'm not very strongly wedded to this idea, but I think
it's an alternative that should be at least considered before
doing anything else drastic.
