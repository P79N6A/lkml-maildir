No.  Kernel programming requires what is essentially assembly language with a 
lot of syntactic sugar, which C provides.  Higher-level languages abstract away 
too much detail to be suitable for the sort of bit-perfect control you need when 
you're directly controlling bare metal.  You can still use object-oriented 
programming techniques in C, and we do this all the time in the kernel, but we 
do so with more fine-grained explicit control than a language like Objective-C 
would give us.  More to the point, if we tried to use Objective-C, we'd find 
ourselves needing to fall back to C-style explicitness so often that it wouldn't 
be worth the trouble.
In other news, I hear Hurd boots again!
