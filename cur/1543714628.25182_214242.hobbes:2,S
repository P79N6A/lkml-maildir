No, that shouldn't be necessary.  With a per-arch huge_pte_offset()
(returning a hugepte_t *) and similar arch functions for establishing
and tearing down huge ptes handle_hugetlb_mm_fault() should be able to
be generic.  More significantly, it should still be possible to make
it generic when adding copy-on-write, which makes it less trivial.
To unify even the non-ppc64 archs we already have to allow for the
hugepage pagetables to have different structure across archs - on i386
and ppc64 the hugePTEs lie in PMD slots, on sparc64 and sh they lie in
(normal) PTE slots and on IA64 they lie in the PTE slots of a special
set of pagetables.  Given that, it seems conceptually logical to me
that we also not assume the hugepage PTEs have the same layout as
normal PTEs.  It makes the handle_mm_fault function not the least more
complicated.
