But dumb multiport boards support sharing just fine:
0: uart:16550A port:3F8 irq:4 baud:1200 tx:6 rx:9587 RTS|CTS|DTR|DSR
1: uart:16550A port:2F8 irq:3 baud:9600 tx:9 rx:2 brk:2 
2: uart:unknown port:3E8 irq:4
3: uart:unknown port:2E8 irq:3
4: uart:16550A port:1A0 irq:5 baud:9600 tx:0 rx:0 CTS
5: uart:16550A port:1A8 irq:5 baud:9600 tx:0 rx:0 
6: uart:16550A port:1B0 irq:5 baud:9600 tx:0 rx:0 
7: uart:16550A port:1B8 irq:5 baud:9600 tx:0 rx:0 
There's more to it than just "it doesn't work." I note that 2.5.70 still
sets the NIC and AHA1540 to the same irq, while 2.4.18 doesn't. I gave up
on that, I can't change the hardware (specialty hardware) so I run 2.4
kernels. Someday I'll fight with it.
