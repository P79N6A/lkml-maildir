So let's keep requiring the "trashes performance" hacks, because they're
not directly in the barriers code? Hey, we nailed one foot to the ground,
and since it's not the nail's fault, let's do the same to the other foot?
It does not matter, since we can't move around right now, so it's a pretty
neat idea, isn't it?

You can just replace barriers with NOPs without too many complications,
because it only matters in cases of system failure. And even then,
it's only the difference between having a filesystem corruption and not
having it ... Who'd care?

No, and seeing the same resubmit logic in more than one place should give
you the clue, even if you don't grasp that intermixing requests which
explicitely MUST NOT be intermixed is wrong.
The sane way is having a software barrier in DM and MD, going back to
sync if the new hardware does not support barriers in hardware. The
filesystems should not even need to know if barriers are supported, 
just use them and they'll DTRT in any case. Any other interface is
worse than useless.
