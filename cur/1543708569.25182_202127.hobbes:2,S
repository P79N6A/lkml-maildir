For a filesystem driver, things are clear: it's the only one writing
to the data on the drive. So when things go wrong: in principle, it's
an internal error. 
It would be nice if you'd always be able to salvage your data by
just mounting the partition, but that's not the case. A specialized
program like ...-repair or fsck will do a better job. 
Now for a logging filesystem, the assumption that it messed up itself
is even stronger than for a classical filesystem. It should be able
to handle whatever happens. 
It's very difficult to check all assumptions about what's on the disk
at every step and still have a reasonable performance. That's why some
errors may only be noticed a bit late and lead to slightly misleading
error messages.
