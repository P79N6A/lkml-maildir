The APIC reduces processing overhead. The APIC bus on the pentium III is
pretty slow (I believe its a serial 4 wire bus or similar). On the
Athlon and Pentium IV it seems to be a lot faster.
In the case of a livelock the problem is probably the cost of handling
the IRQ and poking slowly at the chip. Latency is pretty immaterial here
compared with irq servicing overheads.
