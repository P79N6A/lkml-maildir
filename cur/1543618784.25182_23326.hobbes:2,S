Hi,
last week (17.01.02) I wrote that I had these ext2 
errors with 2.4.17, destroing my data.
After switching back to 2.4.10, fsck'ing and backing up the 
remaining files I recompiled the 2.4.17 and started to rerun the 
system with this kernel. 
Today the error appeared again!!
I shut down the system now, so that it is not destroying 
itself too much.. :-(
Sunday evening I can tell you more about it (if you like to)
because the system is actual about 100 km away.
So, if you need more information, please contact me. I can 
send you any logs, etc. you need..
c.u.
..patrick
