Andy reported 20MB/sec on hdparm. I do not think it is possible to
write faster than that. And that seems about ok for notebooks, X32
(pretty new) has:
root@amd:~# hdparm -t /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  108 MB in  3.01 seconds =  35.85 MB/sec

Unfortunately all these "small things" add up.

Interesting use, but for embedded app, they can just reserve partition
as well. [I have seen some patches doing that.]
