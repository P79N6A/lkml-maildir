It wasn't quite as cooperative today, but after a few attempts I was
able to reproduce it.
     root@glitch[~]# modprobe keyspan
     Warning: /lib/modules/2.4.5/kernel/drivers/usb/serial/usbserial.o symbol for parameter vendor not found
     Segmentation fault
     root@glitch[~]# ps -ef|grep "[m]odprobe"
     root@glitch[~]#
     root@glitch[~]# egrep "usb|key" /proc/modules 
     keyspan                22112 (initializing)
     usbserial              17296   0 [keyspan]
     usb-uhci               21200   0 (unused)
     usbcore                48688   1 [keyspan usbserial usb-uhci]
I browsed the full ps output as well, but I didn't find anything
looking like what you described.
