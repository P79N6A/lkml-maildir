I'm not sure exactly, I didn't run the test.  I *think* it's just over 50% of 
physical memory.

Yes, it does various things on various vms.  On 2.4.9 it stays on the 
inactive list until free memory gets down to rock bottom, then most of it 
moves to the active list and the system reaches a steady state where it can 
operate, though with kswapd grabbing 99% CPU (two processor system), but the 
test does complete.  On the current kernel the it dies.

It's how the google database engine works, and keeps latency down, by mapping 
big database files into memory.  I didn't get more information than that on 
the application.

In the tests I did, it was about 1 gig out of 2.  I'm not sure how much 
memory is mlocked in the 3.5 Gig test the one that's failing, but it's 
certainly not anything like all of memory.  Really, we should be able to 
mlock 90%+ of memory without falling over.
