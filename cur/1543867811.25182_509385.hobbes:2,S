Any comments for this issue?  If my understanding was correct, I think
add some checking to netif_receive_skb() is better then fixing all
poll routines.  Is this patch acceptable?
Subject: fix irq problem with NAPI + NETPOLL
It seems netif_receive_skb() was designed not to call from irq
context, but NAPI + NETPOLL break this rule.  If netif_receive_skb()
was called from irq context, redirect to netif_rx() instead of
processing the skb in that context.
