Not yet, but it will go in as soon as the current shitstorm will settle
down. And with that we couldn't care less for replacement vs. mounting
atop - automounter would mount at that point anyway and you either get
the trap replaced with the real tree (the _unmount_ is replaced with 
"mount the trap here and it will replace the tree") or you get the tree
mounted over trap and umount just exposes the trap again. Both semantics
are equally usable for direct mounts - no problem with that.
