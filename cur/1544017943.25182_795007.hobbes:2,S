can't understand...
Perhaps I missed something, but from the correctness pov it doesn't
matter who does sched_setscheduler/etc (except _nocheck() would be
better). However it does matter from the scalability pov, we should
move as much as possible from create_kthread() because we have a
single process with executes the "create" requests.
OK, please forget. This reminds me kthread.c needs a major rework
anyway, hopefully I'll try to do this soon.
