I'm doing the main i2o code. The main i2o code has lots of problems on non
32bit little endian systems and won't work on 2.5 without a major rework. I'm
doing that work in 2.4 since with 2.4 I at least know that when it dies it
was probably my fault. Until 2.4 is sorted please don't bother with the i2o/*
directory.
The dpt is seperate because it speaks a slightly odd dialect of i2o and the
native driver works nicely. The same is also true for the i2o code hiding
in the Red Creek vpn driver.
