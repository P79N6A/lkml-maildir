And don't forget c) every single bug or problem report about any machine
with that driver will get sent to you - none of the developers and very
few of the others (especially on LKML) will touch it if the problem occurs
while that driver is loaded.
(For references, check the mail archives for issues from people w/ nvidia
cards - you'll see the occasional help request, followed by quite a lot of
"go talk to nvidia about it, its a binary driver so we can't help"...)
