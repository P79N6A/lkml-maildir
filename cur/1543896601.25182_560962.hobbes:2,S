correct, but we are talking about what a confined process can get to 
without assistance from an unconfined process.

AA can be extended to cover these things in the future.
remember 'release early release often'?
how about 'perfect is the enemy of good enoug'?
at this point they're trying to get the initial implementation in so that 
people can start takeing advantage of it. As a side effect the cost of 
maintaining it will decrease, and they can put effort into planning future 
enhancements.
besides, as far as the network communication goes, doesn't netfilter now 
have a way to make rules for specific processes? if they don't then it 
could be added, but the details of the implementation would probably be 
very different from the current AA file controls.
how does delaying the acceptance of the current implementation encourage 
the additional features being added?
but to answer your two comments.
how does mozilla access your mail over the network without first capturing 
your password from somewhere?
as far as IPC goes, unix sockets are unavailable (AA as-is will control 
them), so you must be talking about signals or shared memory as the IPC 
mechanisms that mozilla would use to access your mail.
please explain to me what mail client you are useing that exposes your 
mail via these mechinsms.
