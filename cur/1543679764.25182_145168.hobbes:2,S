it's not write-specific.  you can see below that you're somehow
managing to trigger roughly two interrupts per *either* bi or bo.
for a normal IDE setup, you should see one interrupt per 16-64K
under average use.  it's almost like your sys somehow thinks
that it can only transfer 1 sector per interrupt!

no, it's basically in=2*(bi+bo), as if your system somehow believes
it can only do a single sector per interrupt (PIO and -m1 perhaps?)
it should be more like 32K per interrupt.

have you tried without that?
