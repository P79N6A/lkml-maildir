I forwarded the messages to uce@ftc.gov.  This is the place where the
Federal Trade Commission collects illegal UCE (a.k.a. SPAM).  Forging
a return address on a commercial solicitation and/or not giving a
valid way to be removed from the list is illegal in the United States.
The FTC prosecutes those who violate these laws.
