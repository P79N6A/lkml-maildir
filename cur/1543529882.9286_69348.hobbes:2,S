Greetings, this is my first linux-kernel post, but I'm a longtime Linux
user.
I'm installing Linux on a dual PIII Asus based system. My initial
install was kernel 2.2.12-20smp, the out-of-the-box kernel in RedHat
6.1; my Plextor PX-W8432T IDE CD-R mounts fine in that version.
However, after building and installing kernel 2.2.14, I can't get the
CD-R(OM) to mount. I've got several symptoms:
1. mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom   returns very quickly under
2.2.14, and instead of mounting, it changes the mountpoint to a file
with 0 bytes (?!), e.g.
  before: drwxrwxr-x   2   root  root    4096 Feb 6   1996  cdrom
  after: -r-xr-xr-x  1  root root    0  Dec 31   1969  cdrom
2. Of course, the device is not really mounted, even though a simple
"mount" (no args) shows it to be so.
3. When I try to subsequently umount the CD-ROM, I get the following
errors:
VFS: Disk change detected on device ide1(22,0)
hdc: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hdc: DMA disabled
hdc: drive not ready for command
hdc: ATAPI reset complete
hdc: irq timeout: status=0x80 { Busy }
hdc: ATAPI reset complete
hdc: irq timeout: status=0x80 { Busy }
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:00 (hdc), sector 64
hdc: status timeout: status=0x80 { Busy }
hdc: drive not ready for command
hdc: ATAPI reset complete
hdc: irq timeout: status=0x80 { Busy }
hdc: ATAPI reset complete
hdc: irq timeout: status=0x80 { Busy }
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:00 (hdc), sector 66
hdc: status timeout: status=0x80 { Busy }
hdc: drive not ready for command
hdc: ATAPI reset complete
hdc: irq timeout: status=0x80 { Busy }
hdc: ATAPI reset complete
hdc: irq timeout: status=0x80 { Busy }
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:00 (hdc), sector 0
4. Sometimes the errors occur upon mount rather than umount; in these
cases, the mount fails and the mountpoint remains unchanged.
5. One such attempt yielded an error warning about a "cruft" interface;
the mount still failed.
Again, this works perfectly under 2.2.12-20; I haven't tried anything
other than 2.2.12-20 and 2.2.14. I have both kernels bootable via lilo;
I boot 2.2.12-20, mount the CDROM and all is well, umount and reboot to
2.2.14, try to mount, it fails (either mount or umount), I reboot back
to 2.2.12-20, and it succeeds again. I don't have any patches applied to
either kernel.
Does anyone have any ideas? Although I am subscribed to
linux-kernel-digest, I would appreciated a CC: on any replies.
Best regards,
Brad
