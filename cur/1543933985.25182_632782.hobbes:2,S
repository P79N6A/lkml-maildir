Subject: [PATCH] Hibernation: Document __save_processor_state() on x86-64 (rev. 2)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/30/230

From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@sisk.pl>
Document the fact that __save_processor_state() has to save all CPU
registers referred to by the kernel in case a different kernel is
used to load and restore a hibernation image containing it.
