find a libpcap using CONFIG_PACKET_MMAP, and you will probably forget about
drops IMHO
if you do find it, please let me now
I'm currently using pandora's monitor modified libpcap.... GREAT
I think that Linux is the only OS that provides user space buffers to packet
capture... am I wrong?
Maybe this is an offtopic on this mailing list...
