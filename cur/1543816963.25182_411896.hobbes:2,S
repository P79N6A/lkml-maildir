 OK, I know the I2C protocol, and I can imagine a hardware board which does
 not have a way to detect its own presence - or the presence of its own ISA bus.
 What I dislike the most is that, after the driver has taken more than 20
 seconds to probe something it did not find, it did not display anything to
 say "either there is a hardware problem, or you should disable me".
 Are you sure that there isn't any distribution around trying to insert
 _all_ the modules to do hardware detection?
 Note that most I2C driver detect abscence of the hardware in a lot less than
 a second: most of the I2C system is fine.
 Regards,
 Etienne.
