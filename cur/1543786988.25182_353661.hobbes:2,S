Thanks.  Can't say I'm surprised at that info.

"nosmp" (currently) means 1 CPU and no LAPICs/no IOAPICs.
It doesn't have to be that way, but yes, I suspect that it's
mostly historical, plus a method of getting to a lowest common
hardware boot sequence, which is sometimes nice for debugging
or installation.
Nevertheless, there is a problem here.  What do you suggest
to solve it?  Just making PCI_MSI depend on Local APIC support,
or something else?
[Kernel is assigning MSI interrupts, but then they are "lost."
Using "irqpoll" will find them, but that's a performance penalty.]
