Hello,
I've got an ATA hard disk with bad sectors. I want to read the good
sectors quickly, replacing the others with zeroes. However, when I'm
trying to read it sector by sector, reading each bad sector takes 20-150
s. Before diving into the code, I'd like to ask whether there is an
interface (like ioctl or /proc) to disable bus resets and re-reading
attempts if the first read operation fails.
Please cc to me, I'm not subscribed.
Thanks in advance,
Baurjan.
