Hello,
Current system: DELL Optiplex G1 - P2-350Mhz/64mb Ram/IDE/3COM Vortex, RH6.0 with latest updates.
I get the following errors while compiling 2.3.9 using "make bzlilo 2>make.error"
piix.c: In function `piix_dmaproc':
piix.c:280: warning: implicit declaration of function `ide_dmaproc'
mtrr.c:295: warning: `main_lock' defined but not used
fault.c: In function `do_page_fault':
fault.c:114: warning: `sem' might be used uninitialized in this function
drivers/block/block.a(piix.o): In function `piix_dmaproc':
piix.o(.text+0x633): undefined reference to `ide_dmaproc'
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
However if I disable mtrr I get:
fault.c: In function `do_page_fault':
fault.c:114: warning: `sem' might be used uninitialized in this function
.config (with mtrr) is:
