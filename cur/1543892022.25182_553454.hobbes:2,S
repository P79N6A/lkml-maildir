Note that tsc_setup in i386 at least has:
static int __init tsc_setup(char *str)
{
        printk(KERN_WARNING "notsc: Kernel compiled with CONFIG_X86_TSC,"
                                "cannot disable TSC.\n");
        return 1;
}
If TSC isn't actually a compile-time feature then we should allow it to
be disabled on the command line!
This is what I have for i386:
#ifndef CONFIG_MATH_EMULATION
# define NEED_FPU       (1<<(X86_FEATURE_FPU & 31))
#else
# define NEED_FPU       0
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_TSC
# define NEED_TSC       (1<<(X86_FEATURE_TSC & 31))
#else
# define NEED_TSC       0
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_PAE
# define NEED_PAE       (1<<(X86_FEATURE_PAE & 31))
#else
# define NEED_PAE       0
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_CMOV
# define NEED_CMOV      (1<<(X86_FEATURE_CMOV & 31))
#else
# define NEED_CMOV      0
#endif
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_CMPXCHG64
# define NEED_CX8       (1<<(X86_FEATURE_CX8 & 31))
#else
# define NEED_CX8       0
#endif
#define REQUIRED_MASK0  (NEED_FPU|NEED_TSC|NEED_PAE|NEED_CMOV|NEED_CX8)
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_USE_3DNOW
# define NEED_3DNOW     (1<<(X86_FEATURE_3DNOW & 31))
#else
# define NEED_3DNOW     0
#endif
#define REQUIRED_MASK1  (NEED_3DNOW)
And for x86-64:
/* x86-64 baseline features */
#define NEED_FPU        (1<<(X86_FEATURE_FPU & 31))
#define NEED_PSE        (1<<(X86_FEATURE_PSE & 31))
#define NEED_TSC        (1<<(X86_FEATURE_TSC & 31))
#define NEED_MSR        (1<<(X86_FEATURE_MSR & 31))
#define NEED_PAE        (1<<(X86_FEATURE_PAE & 31))
#define NEED_CX8        (1<<(X86_FEATURE_CX8 & 31))
#define NEED_PGE        (1<<(X86_FEATURE_PGE & 31))
#define NEED_FXSR       (1<<(X86_FEATURE_FXSR & 31))
#define NEED_CMOV       (1<<(X86_FEATURE_CMOV & 31))
#define NEED_XMM        (1<<(X86_FEATURE_XMM & 31))
#define NEED_XMM2       (1<<(X86_FEATURE_XMM2 & 31))
#define REQUIRED_MASK0  (NEED_FPU|NEED_PSE|NEED_TSC|NEED_MSR|NEED_PAE|\
                         NEED_CX8|NEED_PGE|NEED_FXSR|NEED_CMOV|\
                         NEED_XMM|NEED_XMM2)
#define SSE_MASK        (NEED_XMM|NEED_XMM2)
/* x86-64 baseline features */
#define NEED_LM         (1<<(X86_FEATURE_LM & 31))
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_USE_3DNOW
# define NEED_3DNOW     (1<<(X86_FEATURE_3DNOW & 31))
#else
# define NEED_3DNOW     0
#endif
#define REQUIRED_MASK1  (NEED_LM|NEED_3DNOW)
