Init should never get killed. Killing init can be compared to destroy the TCP
stack. Some app can keep to run right for some minute until they run socket()
and then they will hang. Same with init, some task may still run right for
some time but the machine will die eventually. We simply must not pass the
point of not return or we're buggy and after the bug triggered we have to force
the user to reboot the machine as only way to recover.
