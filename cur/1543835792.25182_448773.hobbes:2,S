Actually, the best thing to do might be to designate a symbol (say &, 
like in automount) as "insert the boot loader command line here."
That way you can specify things in the builtin command line that are 
both prepended and appended to the boot loader command, and if you wish, 
you can emit it completely.
The default would be just "&".
