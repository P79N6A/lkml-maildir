I have both an Athlon and a broken network link (in case folks were
thinking 'gee its quiet in here'). I'm currently running 2.2.12 final 3
on it plus some MMX accelerations for memcpy/copy_page/clear_page. On
the list next is doing MMX copy*user. On the Athlon using MMX is important
with MMX and 3DNow prefetch I can copy data 40% faster than the string 
instruction method. 
I've not been able to test UDMA. Straight DMA works but with the drive in
the box right now a member of the UDMA blacklist I dont wish to experiment
on the UDMA side.
