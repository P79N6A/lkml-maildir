Yeah, thats what I meant. In the html doc shipped with version 0.1.7,
it says "all functions in libusb v0.1 are synchronous, meaning the
functions block and wait for the operation to finish or timeout before
returning execution to the calling application. Asynchronous operation
will be supported in v1.0, but not v0.1."...

Well, I would have liked a lib-function like 
find_device(int vend_id,int prod_id);
but thats really not a big deal.

Thanks for that hint, I'll have a look at it. I only need 1 val per
file, i.e. a "firmware" file, which I learned is best done with the
firmware_class.
