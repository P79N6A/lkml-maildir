I'm getting a repeatable BUG in sched.c:564 when accessing
/dev/ttyUSB[01] which are provided by ftdi_sio.o.
I've tried both 2.4.21-pre5-ac3 as well as vanilla 2.4.20 and the
results are the same.
The USB hardware in question is an EasySync dual port RS485 to USB
converter (USB-2COMi).
I understand that ftdi_sio.o was intended for single port converters,
and wonder whether the fact that this hardware is dual port is causing
the problem, however both ports appear to be detected and set up OK
(/dev/ttyUSB0 and /dev/ttyUSB1) and we've had minicom sessions on two
boxes talking to each other.
However it is easy to cause the BUG by simply:
bash # echo "Some string" >/dev/ttyUSB0
The decoded Oops, output from dmesg and my .config are all attached.
Any help in this matter would be much appreciated,
Thankyou.
