I'll send substantive comments later, but meanwhile note
that the *CURRENT* version was posted last Friday:
  
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=119463810905330&w=2
  
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=119463811005344&w=2
  
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=119463811105352&w=2
Plus the appended tweak.  It's more useful to send patches
against current code, so applying them doesn't provide a
small avalanche of rejects.  :)
With respect to this patch adding gpio_is_onchip(), I
don't see a point.  The "gpio >= chip->base" check
is basically "are the data structures corrupted?" and
so it should only be done if "extra_checks" is defined.
(And IMO, not then ...)  And combining the other two tests
that way doesn't make anything more clear to me.  That's
somewhat of a style issue, I guess, unless you're like
me and don't much trust GCC to avoid extra instructions.
