So create /sdev and fill it with all the device nodes that you deem
static and worthy of chowning. As far as sound goes, /dev/dsp and
/dev/snd/* is made writable by something called resmgr+hal+hal_resmgr
(yes, more clutter!). I have not worried about device permissions
in a long time. The only exception is vmware, but that is its very
own problem.

If yours does, then that is bad luck. Mine (again) does not.
That is what a distro is supposed to bring: a system that does not
break ("as much", if you like the extra) on an upgrade as if you
did upgrade software and such by hand.

If you dislike udev so much, why don't you just add
	chmod 666 /dev/*
to /etc/init.d/boot.local...

ISTR that most Windows programs do not even have a configuration
file, but store their bits and pieces in the *even more cryptic*
thing they call Registry. Do you prefer _that_?

You just did not use the right distribution yet.
