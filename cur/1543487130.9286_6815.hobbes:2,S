An important safety tip, since I always forget, if you want your
.config, copy it somewhere, and note that copying to .config* or
config.old don't work. D'oh, I *hate* it when I do that... Of course,
you should probably re-run make config whenever you make mrproper, but
it's often nice to have your old config around as a reference...
