just to clarify: we are talking about SCHED_FIFO processes only:
there is no timeslice concept here
from the manpage:
----
 SCHED_FIFO
       is a simple scheduling algorithm without time slicing. For
       processes  scheduled under the SCHED_FIFO policy, the following
       rules are applied: A SCHED_FIFO  process  that  has
       been  preempted by another process of higher priority will
       stay at the head of the list for  its  priority  and  will
       resume execution as soon as all processes of higher priority
       are blocked again. When a SCHED_FIFO  process  becomes
       runnable,  it  will be inserted at the end of the list for
       its priority.
----
So how does the SCHED_FIFO approach fit within multimedia applications
which are running simultaneously:
quite simple: assuming that the scheduler works reasonably ,
then just use higher SCHED_FIFO priorities (static) using the "earliest
deadline first" approach.
For example: a video player playing a video at 30FPS needs 30ms latencies,
an audio app with 5ms audio fragment size needs to be woken up every 5ms.
Simply run the audio app with higher SCHED_FIFO priority than the video app
(Beos does it in a similar way)
That means as soon an audio interrupt occurs , the audio app will be woken up
regardless if the video player was just rendering a frame.
At this point as soon as the audio app wrote the next fragment (which will
happen every 5ms), it will sleep, and control will go back to the video player.
In fact the video player will be interrrupted several times within the time it
takes to render a frame, but both will run perfectly happy as long as the total
CPU usage of the two apps will not exceed 100%.
If you invert the priority (video player higher than audio player), then
the video player will run ok, but the audio player will experience audio
dropouts.
Even when using RTLinux for these multimedia tasks, you have to meet
these priority conditions or it will simply not work, since you do not
reschedule during an RT task.
 
about:  "ll you need to do is load up the machine until
there are enough processes that want CPU, and fair timesharing
cheduling will put a significant delay between all of their timeslices"
BTW: you can loadup ingo's kernel with 200 SCHED_OTHER threads
all burining up CPU, but the latencies doesn't increase,
since the SCHED_FIFO task is alway the first in the scheduler queue.
So Steve, before talking about "have a gap in understanding" , you
should do a more deeper research on this topic.
Benno.
