Well, uio_dummy was created during development to have something to
test with. It calls uio_event_notify() from a timer routine to 
simulate interrupts without having a real hardware device.
Besides that, uio_dummy has no real use. It might or might not be
useful to put it in mainline. IMHO, we should include it because
it shows ow UIO works and gives developers the possibility to test
at least parts of their userspace code without having the real hardware
(e.g. on their laptop).

I'm afraid the doc too much emphasizes that timer. The reason was probably
that I worked with uio_dummy at the time I wrote the doc. Fact is that you
will rarely use a timer to generate interrupts. The only application I can
think of is something where you want to poll a device, say, every 10msec.
Then it might sometimes be the simplest solution to do it that way. But even
then there are probably userspace-only solutions most of the time.
But in general you're right, if a device doesn't generate hardware 
interrupts, you don't need UIO.

It works like any other driver that handles interrupts. If you want to
support shared interrupts, your handler needs to be able to find out 
whether its device caused the interrupt or something else. You return
IRQ_HANDLED in the first case and IRQ_NONE in the second. If an interrupt
occurs and there's no driver that handles it, then the kernel has every
right to complain. Whoever enabled the interrupt must also be able to
handle it. That's one of the reasons why we need a kernel module to
handle interrupts, you can't do that from userspace.

Introducing new ioctls is ugly.

I see your point. But we need to make some information available for
userspace, in a standardized way. It was a design decision, and I still
find it quite good.
Thanks,
