Subject: Really BAD granularity example in BKCVS output
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I've locally downloaded and installed the GIT version of the BitKeeper tree 
(the first existing upload - have been away for a while, don't know if there 
are others), and while browsing the history for some work, I found this 
commit:
http://localhost/~paolo/git/?p=old-2.6-bkcvs/.git;a=commit;h=b035f9332ce7e205af43f7cfdf4e1cf3625f7ad5
(the hashes work on the kernel.org copy of that repository, assuming it wasn't 
re-exported).
Well, that is *awfully* big (543 files touched)! Isn't there anything which 
can be done about that? What is worse, the commit message is truncated!
And yes, sorry if this is a stupid question.
