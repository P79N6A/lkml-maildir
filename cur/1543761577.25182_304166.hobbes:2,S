I'm not able to test that right now (not on the right system), but did 
you try the exact code I submitted? It would be *very* helpful if 
someone could verify that it leads to a crash, before I go any further.
I also have this feeling that an arbitrary change to the code might make 
the module work without really resolving the problem.

I think pci_find* are used because the code is supposed to be compatible 
with Linux 2.4 as well. Or did pci_get* exist there, too?
Like I said, most of the code was actually written by someone else...
