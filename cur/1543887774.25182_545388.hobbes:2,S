Yes, and needs fixing.  This is almost right, see below.

This test ...

... and this one must not assume that the relevant buffer
is always NULL when the tx_dma has been set up.  Keep the
test against INVALID_DMA_ADDRESS, but fetch the address
from the spi_transfer.
It's legit to set up cpu-virtual (for PIO) and dma addresses
for each buffer, since the upper layer driver has no way to
know if the underlying controller driver is DMA-capable, or
for that matter PIO-capable.
