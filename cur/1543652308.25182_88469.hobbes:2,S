I would model this after user space. (Which does strange things:
--- cut ---
#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
  char *scan = "-100";
  unsigned int foo;
  int bar;
  int res = sscanf(scan, "%ud", &foo);
  printf("%s = %ud = %d\n", scan, foo, res);
  res = sscanf(scan, "%ud", &bar);
  printf("%s = %d = %d\n", scan, bar, res);
}
--- cut ---
% gcc -o xxx xxx.c
./xxx 
-100 = 4294967196d = 1
-100 = -100 = 1
Hm, so I guess, yes, a warning message would be nice IMHO. Returning an
error code would IMHO moot, because noone is checking these codes
anyway.
