Subject: arp.c duplicate assignment of skb->dev ("cosmetic")

hi,
this is rather cosmetical than functional, but in arp.c,
in arp_send(), on line 489
	skb->dev=dev;
is assigned. in line 563, still in the same routine, it is
assigned again without skb or skb->dev being changed. so I guess
this second assignment is not neccessary. I can't see where
skb->dev is changed within the 80  lines. so, we could remove
the second assignment.
