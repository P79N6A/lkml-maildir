I'm not certain I see the difference. I just replaced the comparison
of one label with another.  There may have been more beauty in one or
the other but it really should not have made a difference maintenance
wise.  Perhaps I'm just short some cdrom context here to understand
your problem.
Regardless.  Looking at the code I think we can do something straightforward
and even more stupid without needing any comparisons.
Alan does this look a little better?
static int cdrom_sysctl_handler(struct ctl_table *ctl, int write, struct file * filp,
				void __user *buffer, size_t *lenp, loff_t *ppos)
{
	int *valp = ctl->data;
	int val = *valp;
	int ret;
	
	ret = proc_dointvec(ctl, write, filp, buffer, lenp, ppos);
	if (write) {
	
		/* we only care for 1 or 0. */
		autoclose        = !!cdrom_sysctl_settings.autoclose;
		autoeject        = !!cdrom_sysctl_settings.autoeject;
		debug	         = !!cdrom_sysctl_settings.debug;
		lockdoor         = !!cdrom_sysctl_settings.lock;
		check_media_type = !!cdrom_sysctl_settings.check;
		/* update the option flags according to the changes. we
		   don't have per device options through sysctl yet,
		   but we will have and then this will disappear. */
		cdrom_update_settings();
	}
        return ret;
}
