While I agree that (block_device *) would be a good thing to address
the target block device, the inode *  is consistent with other
operations in this vector: open, release, & ioctl use the same scheme.
The reason for inode * here is that the caller has no easy way to get
to the block_device *. How would the filesystem do that?
