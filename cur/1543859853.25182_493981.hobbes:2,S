Ingo,
We did some benchmarking on 2.6.19-rt14, compared it with 2.6.19 
kernel and noticed several slowdowns.  The test machine is a 2 socket
woodcrest machine with your default configuration.
Netperf TCP Streaming was slower by 40% ( 1 server and 1 client 
each bound to separate cpu cores on different socket, network
loopback mode was used).  
Volanomark was slower by 80% (Server and Clients communicate with 
network loopback mode. Idle time goes from 1% to 60%)
Re-Aim7 was slower by 40% (idle time goes from 0% to 20%)
Wonder if you have any suggestions on what could cause the slowdown.  
We've tried disabling CONFIG_NO_HZ and it didn't help much.
Thanks.
Tim
