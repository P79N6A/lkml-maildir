I think something that a lot of computer pundits haven't figured out yet
is that what they see in the Open Source community is equivalent to being
on all the executive mailing lists at Microsoft *plus* attending all the
product engineering meetings.  They might, however, have been clued in by
that "build 1361" or whatever that pops up on the NT boot screen.  Linux
2.2 has gone through one tenth the number of developmental versions that
NT 4.0 did to reach release, not thirty times as many.  Over a thousand
attempts were so unsatisfactory that they never saw the light of day.
Ask yourselves, O pundits, what your chances would be of ever seeing Build
1 of Windows 2000 -- and what such a glimpse would be worth to you.
Beats me why anybody trusts these people.

just one more silly change to cope with.
