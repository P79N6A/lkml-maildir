Linus I seen you have not included my get_xtime()-s/xtime/__xtime/ patch. 
Am I missing something and the patch was not needed? I think that without
that patch some place of kernel could use a not consistent xtime value
because they are reading xtime without any lock (there could be a bh
handler or a syscall that is modifying xtime running at the same time on
the other CPU). I know the window is very small though...
