well I'm not Rusty by a long shot, but I do see a problem with this, or
at least a subtlety that needs taking into account: the pcmcia subsystem
(I include cardmgr in that) has an internal declaration of the module
name inside the module, and the filename of the module *HAS* to match
that or things just won't work. ide-cs is the one at risk here; I've had
to debug what turned out to be a mismatch during 2.4.2-era on this one
and believe me, that's not funny.
