Yes, i386 defines HPAGE_SHIFT always.

I think this change will cause a compile warning in mm/memory.c:
			if (unlikely(is_vm_hugetlb_page(vma))) {
				unmap_hugepage_range(vma, start, end);
				zap_work -= (end - start) /
						(HPAGE_SIZE / PAGE_SIZE);
This code will be removed by the compiler.  But before that happens, we're
doing a divide by zero and the compiler will whine.
So I'd suggest that you set the !CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE value of HPAGE_SHIFT
to PAGE_SHIFT, not to zero.  I'll make that change locally..
