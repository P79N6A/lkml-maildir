Also just fixed a high latency problem due to partial PCI DMA
implementation.  This is now fixed in 2.3.99-pre1-pre5, with two small
buglets caught by Alexey headed to Linus very soon.

Should be fixed, in pre1-pre5, please let me know differently.
via-rhine needs more stuff from becker's driver merged, maybe I have
convinced Urban Widmark(sp?) to do it, I merge and fix if not...

Mainly cleanups needed at this stage.  Some of my initial logic still
needs cleaning up

also on my hitlist are the remaining pcibios_xxx calls, which are
implementing with a very slooooow compat function (calls pci_find_slot
for each call)
