We had another similar post a few weeks ago. *Two* Linux kernel Forth
interpreters in one year -- what are the odds? :)
Seriously, though, a Forth that could be accessed inside the kernel has
profound (in)security implications. I'm not sure I like the thought of
something as powerful as Forth available with kernel privileges. It
would make an interesting debugging / diagnostic tool if "kgdb", etc.
didn't exist, but given that there *are* some debug tools already, I'm
not sure what I'd do with it.
Now a *user-space* full-featured Forth -- something like Tom Zimmer's
Windows32 Forth or Forth, Inc.'s SwiftForth -- with GUIs and all the
other goodies -- now *that* I'd love to have. But a tiny Forth in the
kernel? Nope.
