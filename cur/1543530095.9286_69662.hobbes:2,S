Subject: Aiee[...] - ISDN with AVM Fritz/PCI and any kernel...

Hi,
  I've got a problem with the ISDN card mentioned in the subject and any
kernel I tried (2.2.14, 2.2.15pre14, 2.3.51). The machine is supposed to act
as a mail gateway for a small LAN with a dial-up ISDN connection on SyncPPP,
so it's quite small - 16MB RAM, 18MB swap, small HDD, Pentium 233MHz, 
D-Link 500TX NIC, AVP card detected as shown below (output from 2.3.51):
HiSax: AVM PCI driver Rev. 1.15
AVM PCI: stat 0x3020a
AVM PCI: Class A Rev 2
HiSax: AVM Fritz!PCI config irq:12 base:0xE800
AVM PCI: ISAC version (0): 2086/2186 V1.1
AVM Fritz PnP/PCI: IRQ 12 count 0
AVM Fritz PnP/PCI: IRQ 12 count 3
ippp0 device is up, no default route:

The routable IP address is temporary, so that I can access the machine from
the lab LAN.
The machine isn't connected to the ISDN line yet, as I'm testing it in a lab
before shiping it to our customer. After issuing the 'isdnctrl dial ippp0'
nothing's happening for a while and after a moment I get the Aiee oops
(process swapper, pid 0, oops 0002) and the machine locks hard. No trace in the logs, 
hardware reset is necessary. If there's a need I'll copy the backtrack data by 
hand - just let me know (right now I include only the Code: fragment).
The machine runs a Debian/potato system with isdnutils v3.0 installed.
The config is attached. Kernel was compiled with gcc 2.7.2.3. 
Oops code: c6 40 30 10 8b 43 04 ff b3 8c 00 00 00 68 60 03 00 00 50 8b
thanks in advance,
marek
