This is useful when say a NUMA node is being removed. With new multi-core
CPUs comming up, considering a 2 core with HT, we could have up to 4 logical
per socket. On NUMA node with 4 sockets, a node removal will mean we 
do 16 single cpu offlines. Each time the process and interrupts could
end up on a CPU that might be removed just immediatly.
The same is also useful for SMP Suspend/resume cases since the logical offline
is same here as well.
Even thought the code changes seem a lot, most of it is just preparation of
functions ready to accept a cpumask_t instead of a single cpu like earlier.
The reason we split them to smaller chunks so the scope of change is well
understood with each patch.
The major changes are
 - stop machine to run cpu offline functions on each cpu going offline
 - prepare offline functions in offline path to take cpumask_t
 - Some task migrate dead lock removal consideration that we ran into
    during stress test.
I know Shaohua ran tests for more than 20+ hrs with the patch, both on i386 
and x86_64.
once we get some time deltas on a bigger machine it will help a lot. 
Iam also trying to check with some OEM';s who have such large machines for
some data.. keep posted.
