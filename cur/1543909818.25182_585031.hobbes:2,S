SMM/SMI is more likely to be what bumps you 224usec or more.

Go for it. The other architectures generally inherit it by inheriting
similar bridge chips or in more modern times the RTC macrocell. It should
also be possible to debug by putting in an optional sanity check
initially which checks the read made sense compared to a few more
