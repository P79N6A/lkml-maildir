I use menuconfig almost excludively, there are already quite a few cases where 
the menuconfig is used, so you already need to watch out for the '--->' when you 
turn it on.
I haven't applied this patch series, but I definantly like the concept. I spend 
a _lot_ of time with a new kernel going through and entering menus for the sole 
purpose of disabling everything in them, being able to do so from the level 
above would be nice.
that being said, I also won't object to anything that makes these more obvious, 
but it's not a new problem for people useing menuconfig.
