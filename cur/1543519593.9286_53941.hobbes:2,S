Look at get_wchan, which traverses the frame list to find the first PC
that's not in a scheduling function.
Check also __builtin_frame_address(N) and __builtin_return_address(N) in
the GCC info.  They do exactly what you want if they work, but I
understand that only N == 0 works on some processors.  If that's the
case for your Alpha, __builtin_frame_address(0) is still a clean way to
get the first frame.
Don't ask me for any more clues as I don't have an Alpha!
have a nice day,
