A bit late, since they're already in, but, ACK.  (I'm on East Coast 
Vampire time, apparently)
Now that this is resolved, please allow me a bit of grumbling.  I always 
thought the original course -- 2.6.29 -- was best for these patches.  I 
had even queued them for 2.6.29, when they found their way into 2.6.28 
anyway.  Without /any/ testing by libata maintainers or linux-next. 
Without even being tested on non-NCQ setups, apparently.
The process broke down completely with this patchset :(
I still want to see this stuff in 2.6.29 though; it is the right way to 
go: following the theme of using block rather than SCSI bits in libata 
generic code [when those bits are, themselves, generic rather than 
SCSI-specific].
