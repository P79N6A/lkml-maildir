Here, on an Asus P2L97 (LX chipset), on 2.3.48:
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.30
PIIX4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 21
PIIX4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
hda: Maxtor 87000D8, ATA DISK drive
hdb: SAMSUNG WU32165A (2.1GB), ATA DISK drive
hdc: Hewlett-Packard CD-Writer Plus 8100, ATAPI CDROM drive
hdd: , ATAPI CDROM drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
hda: Maxtor 87000D8, 6679MB w/256kB Cache, CHS=851/255/63
hdb: SAMSUNG WU32165A (2.1GB), 2060MB w/109kB Cache, CHS=4186/16/63
(hdd is a no-brand cdrom)
I've disabled DMA because otherwise it works for a while... then stops
with a DMA timeout (and disable it). If I remove hdb, then all works
fine (maybe some flat cable problem or similar. If I put ANYTHING on
hdb, DMA stop working :(
