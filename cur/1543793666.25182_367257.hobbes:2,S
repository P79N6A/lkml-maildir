Nope, all the changes would be constrained to the definition of struct
page, and struct page is special.
struct page {
	...
#if __GNUC__ > 2
	union {
		spinlock_t ptl;
		struct {
			unsigned long private;
			struct address_space *mapping;
		}
	}
#else
	union {
		unsigned long private;
		spinlock_t ptl;
	} u;
	struct address_space *mapping;
#endif
and
#if __GNUC__ > 2
#define page_private(page)		((page)->private)
#define set_page_private(page, v)	((page)->private = (v))
#else
#define page_private(page)		((page)->u.private)
#define set_page_private(page, v)	((page)->u.private = (v))
#endif
Of course, adding "u." and "u.s." all over the place would be a sane
solution, but we can do that later - I'm sure we'll be changing struct page
again.
View the above as "a space optimisation made possible by gcc-3.x".
