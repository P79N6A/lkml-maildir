It's not Atmel whose permission you need to do this, it's the other
kernel developers whose permission you need.  By releasing their code
under the GPL, the people who hold copyright on all the other kernel
code have essentially given you permission to modify and redistribute
their code as long as you make source available for the resulting work.
The question is whether adding this binary blob to the linux kernel
violates the license that the kernel developers gave you.  I can't see
how Amtel saying it's OK would make it so.
