     * 3.2 Turning off the CPU bus disconnect in the BIOS? (verify) 
(drawback: causes cpu to run significantly hotter)
Inprecice: CPU runs as hot as without disconnect, only without load, cpu 
disconnect lets the cpu cool down.
With athcool you can alsao turn it off, or there is a quirk-patch 
available from Bart.
     * 3.3 Apply patches cooked up by Ross Dickson, possibly in 
conjunction with 3.2? (verify)
           o 3.3.1 Seems to work for Craig Bradney (hardware unknown, 
some Asus board?) and Prakash K. Cheemplavam (Abit NF7-S)
I have Rev2 (2.0) board and d22 (or 2.2 ? Abit has a strange way of 
numbering.) Bios. I only applied first patch. I already use an 
equivalent to the second one.
