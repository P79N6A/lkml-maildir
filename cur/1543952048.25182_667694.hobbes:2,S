You get 8-16MB per disk with most drives today. Different firmware will 
do different things about how aggressively they push the data out to 
platter.

Most people don't see power outages too often - maybe once a year? When 
you travel with a laptop, we are always effectively on a UPS so that 
will also tend to mask this issue.
The ingest rate at the time of a power hit makes a huge difference as 
well - basically, pulling the power cord when a box is idle is normally 
not harmful. Try that when you are really pounding on the disks and you 
will see corruptions a plenty without barriers ;-)
One note - the barrier hit for apps that use fsync() is just half an 
order of magnitude (say 35 files/sec instead of 120 files/sec). If you 
don't fsync() each file, the impact is lower still.
Still expensive, but might be reasonable for home users on a box with 
family photos, etc.
