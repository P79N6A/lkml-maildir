Hmmm.  There aren't _that_ many of those cases, right?  Are there any
that absolutely need raw access to the buddy allocator?  I'm pretty sure
that pagetables can be moved over to a slab, as long as we bump up the
alignment.
It does seem a wee bit silly to have the pointer in _all_ of the struct
pages, even the ones for which we will never do any accounting (and even
on kernels that never need it).  But, a hashing scheme sounds like a
fine idea.
