On my windows xp box, I just ran the following three experiments,
all inside a window brought up by running Start->Run "cmd":
 C:\ copy con foo
 blah blah blah
 ^Z
 C:\ copy con aux
 blah blah blah
 C:\ copy con aux.h
 blah blah blah
The first experiment above created a file named 'foo',
containing 'blah blah blah'
The second and third experiments both returned to the
command prompt when I pressed "Enter" at the end of the
"blah blah blah", after first complaining:
   The system cannot find the file specified.
           0 file(s) copied.
This is on a fairly vanilla and uptodate Windows XP SP2.
