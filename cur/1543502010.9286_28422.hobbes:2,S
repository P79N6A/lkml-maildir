Take a look into arch/XXX/kernel/smp.c at the function
smp_send_reschedule.
This (and the similar IPI functions) allows CPU X to send IPI interrupts
to CPU Y.  As a warmup, write some code that instruments the IPI
interrupts.  You will find that in 2.3.9 you have quite some number of 
smp_send_reschedule. Notice the use of smp_send_reschedule in the
wake_up
routines.
Tips, add your own variables to the task struct (sched.h) to mark your
processes, then write code that only deals with your processes.  In this
way
you will at least get a system that boots and works until you enable
your "hacks" (using what ever means you choose to control your hacks).
