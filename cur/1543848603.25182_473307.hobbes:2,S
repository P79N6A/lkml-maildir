There is something else that writes, however, that I have gotten complaints about.
(But I have not investigated.)
People doing forensics take a copy of a disk and want to preserve
that copy as-is, never changing a single bit, only looking at it.
But it is reported that also when a partition is mounted read-only,
the journaling code of ext3 will write to the journal.
