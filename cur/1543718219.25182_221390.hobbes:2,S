Yes, that's the goal I have.  Although, the above scenario, they've
already been limited (IOW, if nothing's been touched, all behaves the
same).  Starting with limited inheritable (as say uid 500), execute
a non-root, setuid (say uid 99) program, is this expected to change
effective set?  Currently it's a transition for 0 caps to 0 caps, not
very interesting.  Given they are both unprivelged uids, I kept
the (limited) effective.

Yeah, digs hole deeper though.

The caps in the newly exec'd process.  IOW, effective aren't dropped,
but as you'd expect inheritable provides limit.

This does change the current notion of layering.  I see your point though, 
likening it to say reading inode and finding S_ISUID bit.

Yup, I see.  This works in my patch as well.  I'll add this test.  Also
added test to check disabling priv escalation during ptrace of setuid
app.

This does break all those caps aware apps (yeah, tongue-in-cheek ;-)
that actually have the idea to widen the effective set, yet limit the
inheriable set.  Seriously, I don't know how much this matters.
