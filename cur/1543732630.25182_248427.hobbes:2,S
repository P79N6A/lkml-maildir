But it is supposed to according to the docs.
Support multiple filesystem types
    Support multiple filesystem types transparently, plus a useful explicit 
blocklist notation. The currently supported filesystem types are BSD FFS, DOS 
FAT16 and FAT32, Minix fs, Linux ext2fs, ReiserFS, JFS, XFS, and VSTa fs. See 
Filesystem, for more information. 
Cheers,
