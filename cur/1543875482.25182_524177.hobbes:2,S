Finally, this was a userspace problem (hal):
http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/hal/2007-March/007545.html
What I don't understand is this: I supposed that udev (and so udevmonitor)
is independent of hal, more or less hal monitors udev events and does things,
like looking the disc label and so on.
But I do not get any events in udevmonitor if I'm not logged in gnome.
How's this ?
TIA
