Ok, my driver is for a specific cPCI biard which we have developed here. I
want the Linux Kernel to tell me when this board is inserted and/or removed.
I am running on a 700Mhz PIII with a 2.4.18-3 Kernel (Red Hat 7.3) My driver
is written with a call to pci_module_init in the init routine wherein I
specify a probe and remove routine. According to Linux Device Drivers 2nd
edition (pages 489 - 493), As long as the HW supports hot swap, I should get
called automatically whenevr one of the devices (vendor ID device ID) which
I specified in my table gets inserted or ejected. Am I totaly wrong about
this? I am not trying to write a driver for a hotplug controller but for a
device.
Thanks in advance.

Cced back to lkml as I hate taking things off-line unless it's
necessary, archives are your friend.

No, that's enough to register your driver as a PCI driver.  I'm guessing
your pci hotplug controller looks like a PCI device?

See drivers/hotplug/pci_hotplug.h for the interface that a pci hotplug
controller driver needs to interface with (specifcly the
pci_hp_register() and pci_hp_unregister() functions are what you need).

I'm confused, are you talking about a normal PCI card driver, or a PCI
Hotplug controller driver?  What exactly does your driver do?  Does it
talk to a specific PCI card, or does it control power to PCI slots?
thanks,
