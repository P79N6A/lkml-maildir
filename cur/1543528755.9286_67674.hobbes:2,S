This make no sense IMHO. Why don't you also update the rest? Without
updating the rest only updating such two fields is useless. You lose
synchrony with the fields updating them in different places.
head_active drivers could have no knowledge at all about merging an
end_request could do all the work as it does when there's an error.

No, if there's an error you don't skip the rest of segment because
end_that_request_first returns zero if there are more bhs to process in
the request. This also make sense since if there's a defective sector it
doesn't mean the following sector is defective too.

That is a special implementation case of loop. Normal headactive devices
left the req into the queue. Smart devices like scsi removes it forever
and never reinserts it.

That problem has anything to do with plugging logic. If the request_fn
blocks dropping the lock even if you avoid plugging you can have merged
requests in the queue.
If we want to provide backwards compatibility we must add a
"merging" field in the blk_dev_struct and skip the merging path if it's
set to zero.

It's very insane IMHO (see first paragraph).
