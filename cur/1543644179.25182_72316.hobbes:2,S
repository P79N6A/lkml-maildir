10AM is relatively early in the morning for me. =)

Basically, the big ones get laggy, and laggier with more cpus. This fixed
a decent amount of that.
Another thing to note is that the max bandwidth of these disks is 40MB/s,
so we're running pretty close to peak anyway. I need to either get an FC
cable or something to see larger bandwidth gains.
