For those of you interested in this:
 1. According to the bible, Jesus was born when Herod Agrippa
    was ruling in Judea. Herod Agrippa is documented has having
    died in 4 BC.
 2. According to the bible, Joseph and Mary had gone to the
    city of Bethlehem because of the first Great Roman Census.
    History records that these censii were held every 14 years
    with the second being in AD 7 and the third in AD 21.
These two facts imply that the second millenium ended on 31st December
1993, and we have been in the third millenium for nearly six years
now.
To the flamers: This is my ONLY post on this subject, and any replies
will be filed in /dev/null unread.
Best wishes from Riley.
