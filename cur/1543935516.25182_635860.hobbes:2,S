Thanks for these experiments. sched_mc_power_savings is mainly for
the reasonably long(which can be caught by periodic load balance) running
light load(when number of tasks < number of logical cpus).  This tunable
will minimize the number of packages carrying load, enabling the other
completely idle packages to go to the available deepest P and C states.

Not really. Ideally sched_mc_power_savings re-distributes the load(in
the scenarios mentioned above) to different logical cpus in the system, so
as to minimize the busy packages in the system.

In your setup, CPU0 and 3 are the core siblings? If so, this is probably
expected. Previously there was some load distribution happening between
packages. With sched_mc_power_savings, load is now getting distributed
between cores in the same package. But on my systems, typically CPU0 and 2
are core siblings. I will let you confirm your system topology, before we
come to conclusions.

I would have expected similar results like in experiment-1. CPU3 data
seems almost same with and without sched_mc_power_savings. Atleast the
data is not significantly different as in other cases like CPU2 for ex.

While we should see a no change or a simple redistribution(to minimize 
busy packages) in your experiments, for evaluating sched_mc_power_savings,
we can also use some lightly loaded system (like kernel-compilation or
specjbb with 2 threads on  a DP with dual-core, for example and see how the
load is distributed with and without MC power savings.)
Similarly it will be interesting to see how this data varies with and without
tickless.
For some loads which can't be caught by periodic load balancer, we may
not see any difference. But atleast we should not see any scheduling
anomalies.
