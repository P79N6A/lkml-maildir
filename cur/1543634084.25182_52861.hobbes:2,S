I'm fully aware of that. But we have the problem that we need C2'ish 
audit trails and logging facilities. It's a requirement in the company I 
work for. Linux unfortunately isn't quite there yet but with the LSM 
framework it would be possible. I know that SGI at a certain point had 
put a lot of effort into getting something like that into the LSM 
framework. I simply can't wait (for that specific NFS requirement) until 
it is part of the official kernel tree so I hacked that patch together. 
It's easier to forward port my simple patch than to have LSM and a patch.
[Besides all that my boss thinks we can handle the amount of overhead 
and the logged data and he pays my check, so I do it. :)]

Can't do that, company policy and I doubt this would be more efficient 
since you need a damn intelligent parser to get the same information 
from a packet dump.
But thanks for your input. Maybe you or someone else would be able to 
give me a response to my other questions too, if possible. I'd really 
appreciate it.
Best regards and thanks for your effort,
Roberto Nibali, ratz
