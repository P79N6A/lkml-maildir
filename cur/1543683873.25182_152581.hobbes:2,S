           Summary: Startup hangs with SiI 3112 driver compiled in for some
                    time
    Kernel Version: 2.6.0-test2
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: bzolnier@elka.pw.edu.pl
         Submitter: felix.seeger@gmx.de
Distribution: Debian unstable 
Hardware Environment: Asus A7N8X Deluxe (Nforce2) with SiI 3112 
Software Environment: plain 2.6.0-test2, gcc 3.3.1 
Problem Description: 
The driver for my SATA chip need some minutes at bootup because I don't have any devices 
connected to it. It probes for disks with an timeout 3 times per disk (if I am right) 
It takes way to long to startup with an SiI 3112 driver enabled kernel, but without disks 
connected to it. 
Steps to reproduce: 
Build the SiI 3112 driver into the kernel 
Remove both disks from the controller 
Startup and wait
