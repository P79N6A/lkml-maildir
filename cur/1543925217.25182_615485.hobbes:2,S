For example, with a Quadro FX4500 on the H8DCE with the memory hole enabled, 4GB memory will show up as 3728MB in BIOS and 3.64GB in Windows. For some low-end PCI-e VGA cards, it may show up as 4048MB in BIOS.

Seems odd if they can't just map memory as:
2GB at 0
512MB at 2GB
1GB at 4GB
512MB at 5GB
Or for that matter:
2GB at 0
2GB at 4GB
Why can't they do things as simple as that?  If you have a 64bit OS that
would be perfectly fine.
It appears they have 
2GB at 0
512MB at 2GB
1GB at 4GB
64MB at 5GB
32MB at 5GB+64MB
16MB at 5GB+64MB+32MB
Where did they map the rest of the ram?  All I can think there is that
they messed up.  Of course some think that having as much ram for XP
32bit as possible is more important than sane systems, so they will map
more in the first 4GB where XP32 can use it, and then due to alignments
and rounding of the mapping they can't get all the remaining ram mapped
above 4GB.
