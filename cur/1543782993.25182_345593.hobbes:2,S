See the comment at the end of the mail. I tried to send the mail twice
already, and with the URLs in, it wasn't delivered. Probably some spam
filter at kernel.org ate it.

These seem to have an entirely different architecture. The DSL's are
Texas Instrument MIPS, while the Libertas is an Marvell ARM.

The web interface is likely the only part done by D-Link. In the
DWL-G730AP, the rest (board design, etc) was done by Marvell and Global
Sun Technology. The PCB name is "WL AP 2454 NM1 VER:1.1".
