Your proposed check avoids splitting writes if the
size of the write is an even multiple of 8K. Writes
larger than 8K will still be split if not an even multiple
of 8K.
The intent of the original patch (with the flag) is to 
prevent *any* splitting of the write, such that the
line discipline can process the entire write at once.
Also, when the flag is not set, I want the behavior
to be exactly the same as before : the write will
*always* be split when larger than 8K.
Thanks,
Paul
