I use qmail here.
It appears to be a manifestation at least at the surface, 90%+ are
140-160KB emails w/microsoft stuff only, I have not noticed any weird
things in the qmail logs recently.
One has to wonder though why such intense targetting happens, 10-15
e-mails to my address only two hours after I sent an e-mail to LKML.
The previous day, I only had received about 3-4 of them.
It would seem like it would be a lot of work for people to constantly hit
archives of LKML to get e-mail addresses to spam, I wonder if there are
malicious people on the list scurrying e-mail addresses for spam targets.
