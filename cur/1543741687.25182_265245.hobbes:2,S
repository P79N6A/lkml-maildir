mango:~# cat /proc/sys/kernel/kernel_preemption

[all the other VP tunables are not available anymore]
mango:~# cat /proc/sys/kernel/voluntary_preemption
cat: /proc/sys/kernel/voluntary_preemption: No such file or directory
mango:~# cat /proc/sys/kernel/hardirq_preemption
cat: /proc/sys/kernel/hardirq_preemption: No such file or directory
mango:~# cat /proc/sys/kernel/softirq_preemption
