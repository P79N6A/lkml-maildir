If we consider everything that shows up in sysfs as API, we cannot go
ahead and change it without risking userspace breakage. The hierarchy
of objects may very well be an "implementation detail". Otherwise, we
would need to lay out for every user of the kobject infrastructure
which information userspace can rely on (like it is documented for the
driver model).

Yes, non-automatic symlink handling is a large source of pain and
errors. They should probably be tied to sysfs_dirents instead of
kobjects.

That's what I tried to say as well :)
