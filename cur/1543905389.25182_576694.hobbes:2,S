Hi Ingo,
I don't remember the exact details, I can try to find the thread. But I
remember someone was having their system lock up strangly. We later found
that they had softirqs as normal softirqs and interrupts as threads.  I
think there was some driver that didn't expect the softirq to preempt the
irq handler.  Perhaps the softirq was using spin_lock_irq while the irq
thread was just using spin_lock, which I can see as being something
normal.
The standard Linux does not expect an interrupt to be preempted by a
softirq, and with interrupts as threads but not softirqs, I can see that
happening a lot.
