i've released the latest exec-shield patch:
   
http://redhat.com/~mingo/exec-shield/exec-shield-nx-2.6.9-A1
this is a merge of the exec-shield patches used in FC2/FC3 to mainline.
(The patch is smaller than earlier exec-shield patches or the 2.4 patch
because a sub-functionality related to exec-shield (flexmmap) got merged
to 2.6.9.)
This version of exec-shield makes use of NX too, if available (and PAE),
and falls back to the segment-limit method on CPUs that have no NX.
