No, we didn't agree on this. Linus asked me to, but I didn't agree (Andi
seemed to tend towards Linus' opinion), based on my intentions of rather
(mid to long term) removing all this a priori knowledge of what stacks may
be switched from/to. Also, I think a filter like you suggest can far too
easily get out of sync with reality (as an example, on i386 I had long ago
submitted a patch to enhance the double fault handling, which hadn't
been rejected with a reason but also wasn't picked up - in that light I
would immediately question whether the double fault stack, in anticipation
of the double fault handler hopefully calling the unwinder rather sooner
than later to get out information, if possible, on what lead to the double
fault, should be treated positively by that filter, and whether, once that
stack finally gets converted to a per-CPU ones, it would be remembered
to update the filter accordingly).
Basically, as I stated before, I wouldn't try to veto a change that does
that (especially under the impression that my opinion here doesn't seem
to count), but I would neither put me as Signed-off-by or Acked-by
under it.
