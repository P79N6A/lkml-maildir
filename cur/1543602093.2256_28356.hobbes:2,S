The hook is only needed for x86-like architectures, as all of the risc like 
cpus perform the dirty state modification in the page fault handler while 
holding the page_table_lock.

mmu_gather is the hook.  ia64 for instance can create a gather that uses 
the hardware tlb flush instruction to shootdown the entry across all cpus 
and eliminates the race.
