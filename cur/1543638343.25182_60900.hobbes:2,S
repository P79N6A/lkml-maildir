Hi Matthew,

They are messy. Some are certainly required, for exmaple
to support the mmnommu directory. Some simplify cross compilation
(like the ARCH and CROSS_COMPILE changes). Some are just pedantic,
creating a binary named linux since this not a vmlinux system.
I'll look at simplify that.

Looking at it I think it could.

Yep, looks like the whole thing should be merged/moved into
drivers/video.

The include of linux/mm.h is too get some missing includes
(this is probably due to slightly different includes in something
in include/asm-m68knommu, but I haven't tracked it down yet).
The other change is too work around a compiler bug. Unfortunately
this just appeared in 2.5.30. Gcc is generating incorrect addressing
modes for the ColdFire arhcitecture. This is a short term fix until
the compiler is fixed right.

Yes, same as above. I wouldn't expect anyone would want these
changes other than those specifically using ColdFire targets.

Yep, I am looking at that now. That will take me a little
effort and time to put together.

Thanks for the tips.
