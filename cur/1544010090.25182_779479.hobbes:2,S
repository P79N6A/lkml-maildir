Subject: [RFC PATCH v5 7/7] sched: idle_balance() does not call load_balance_newidle()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/11/185

load_balance_newidle() does not get called if SD_BALANCE_NEWIDLE
is set at higher level domain (3-CPU) and not in low level domain
(2-MC).
pulled_task is initialised to -1 and checked for non-zero which
is always true if the lowest level sched_domain does not have
SD_BALANCE_NEWIDLE flag set.
Trivial fix to initialise pulled_task to zero.
