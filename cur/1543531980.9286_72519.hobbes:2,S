	Maybe there need to be memory quotas.  Dunno.  But referring to the
file system.  It is the file doing the write that returns with an error
code.  Not another random process that happened to be using disk space.  Also,
reserving 5% (for root) isn't considered to be a horrible kludge to allow
for recovery from such situations.
