Okay, I got it.  Heh, it turns out SCSI and/or block layer is not
ready for rq->data_len != sum(sg).  When adjusted command completes,
SCSI midlayer completes the command with rq->data_len for PC commands
which eventually ends up in __end_that_request_first().  As there are
extra sg area left after completing rq->data_len, blk layer says so to
SCSI layer and SCSI layer retries the command only with the appended
area.
The following patch gets the writing going.  I really think it's a
serious mistake to break rq->data_len == sum(sg).  If we break
rq->data_len == requested size, the worst bugs are giving wrong size
when issuing commands to application layer of devices which is
relatively easy to spot and not all that command anyway.  Breaking
rq->data_len == sum(sg), bugs will be in internal mechanics, DMA
engine programming and transport layer.  Oh well...
