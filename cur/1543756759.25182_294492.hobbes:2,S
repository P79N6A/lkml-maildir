Hi,
I posted this to the linux-arm mailing list, and Russell King referred
me to the main list.
I'm running an AT91RM9200DK-based board with the 2.6.10 kernel.  I'm
trying to use TmpFS for my root so I don't have a hard-coded ramdisk
size.  My /linuxrc script looks something like this:
mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /mnt/tmp
mkdir /mnt/tmp/initrd
[ copy files from / to /mnt/tmp ]
mount -t devfs devfs /mnt/tmp/dev
echo "Changing mount points..."
cd /mnt/tmp
pivot_root . initrd
cd /
mount -t proc proc /proc
exec chroot . /sbin/init <dev/console >dev/console 2>&1
Init then kicks off a "sysinit" script that immediately does this:
echo "Unmounting old root..."
umount /initrd
echo "Freeing initrd..."
freeramdisk /dev/rd/0
This actually works fine.  The system boots properly, my memory usage
looks good, etc.  But this is what prints to the screen, and it's pretty
scary looking:
Unmounting old root...
VFS: Busy inodes after unmount. Self-destruct in 5 seconds.  Have a nice
day...
Freeing initrd...
Although things seem to work [consistently - it does it every time
during boot], this message frightens me.  Is it safe to ignore, or is my
embedded device about to self-destruct?  :)  Thanks for the help
