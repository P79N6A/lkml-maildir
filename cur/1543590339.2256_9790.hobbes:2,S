No, I broke it when copying the ncpfs dircache code.
That code will reuse an old inode if it already exists (and thus also any
pages attached to it), which is what I wanted and should be fine except
that it needs to invalidate_inode_pages() if something changed.
Xuan and James, you have both seen this bug with smbfs not properly
handling changes made on the server. Could you please test this patch vs
2.4.4 and let me know if it helps or not.
