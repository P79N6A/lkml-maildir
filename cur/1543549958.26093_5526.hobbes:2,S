I addressed that issue in the 2.4pre code so I'm probably a good
person to comment.  The code looks OK except for one thinko which I
will point out below.

I think that it is common courtesy to reply to the author and cc to
the list if that seem appropriately.
It might be worth your while joining linux-raid@vger.kernel.org 
It is very low volume compared to linux-kernel, and would be of
interest if you are using md.

The line
>    md_blocksizes[minor] <<= FACTOR_SHIFT(FACTOR((md_dev+minor)));
doesn't make any sense to me at all.
   FACTOR_SHIFT(FACTOR((md_dev+minor)))
give the shift to get from kilobytes to the RAID cluster size.
Why you would shift up the block size by this amount I cannot imagine.
I'm glad that it is being kept inside CONFIG_ARCH_S390!!

The above line should go OUTSIDE the loop (if at all), not inside.
