Basically.  I copy the attached script into each repo, customize the 
script for the upload destination.
When I publish the tree, I just cd to the toplevel dir on my local 
workstation, and run "./push"

Not quite sure what you're asking, but I'll attempt to answer anyway :)
When I prepare a submission for Linus, I will pull several branches into 
a single 'for-linus' conglomeration branch.  I do this with the 
following incantation, for each branch I am pushing upstream:
git-resolve-script $(cat .git/HEAD) $(cat .git/refs/heads/$branch) \
	`pwd` $branch
(Note that I modified my git-resolve-script to take an additional $4 
argument, which causes the string " branch $4" to be added to the merge 
cset's commit msg)
After I take care of all the merge conflicts[1] from the 
git-resolve-script run, I give the big pile of mush a final build and 
test, and then run "./push".
For the "please pull" email, I use diffstat, git-diff-tree, 
git-changes-script and the newly written git-shortlog.

[1] I'm still scared of conflicts in the merge process.  Simple and 
automatic merging works just fine, like it did under BitKeeper.  But if 
there are conflicts that cause git-pull-script/git-resolve-script to 
bail, then I bail as well:  I export a patch, run patch(1), and then 
handle the merge the Old Fashioned Way(tm) by looking at .rej files.
I really wish somebody would write a merge helper for git that places 
the conflicts side-by-side in the code [in the working dir].  BitKeeper 
and CVS both presented conflicts to you in this manner.
The "I resolved this conflict, now let's continue where we left off" 
process is still quite raw in git.  I suppose this is something that is 
left for others to script, above the plumbing, but hey...
