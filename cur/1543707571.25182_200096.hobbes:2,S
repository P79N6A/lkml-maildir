Hi,
Bart, since you're doing IDE cleanups now, please take some time
to update Documentation/ide.txt
I tried to sync ide.txt with comments in ide.c & friends.
I remember also that Alan suggested removing some of the comments
that actually were not true or the features did not exist or even cause
serious problems.
It would be nice to have it up2date while doing the cleanup.
Regards,
Maciej
