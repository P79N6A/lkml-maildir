Ah... right.  I forgot about that.  Scrap my analysis.  What happens is
really weird tho.

Yeap, reporting is probably a good idea.  libdvdread ppl would be
interested too.  MMC is SCSI command set standard for ODDs and can be
found at t10.org.
I don't think we can proceed with kernel debugging before gathering more
info about this problem.  Feel free to cc me when you ask people about
this problem.  I really like the dvd writer and would love to see the
problem ironed out.
Thanks.
