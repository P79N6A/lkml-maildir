This is meant to instrument scheduling latency, it doesn't improve
anything directly. It likely introduces a fair amount of overhead.
In the event a poor preempt_thresh= parameter is chosen, it may render
systems effectively unusable due to endless printk()'ing (which I should
fix via printk_ratelimit() shortly).
I recommend applying and/or enabling this only for diagnostic purposes.
