It absolutely doesn't work, I tried this, see my other reply.
The issue is add_preferred_console() is __init, driver probe calls are
__devinit which are either __init or not __init.
So even with the FOO_CONSOLE ifdef (or something similar like the
patch I posted) we'll still get section mismatch warnings.

Just removing the __init tag from add_preferred_console() (and
subsequently sunserial_console_match()) is probably the easiest way to
fix all of this.
