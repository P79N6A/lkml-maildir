As usual you explain nothing, so I still don't know why a complete rewrite 
was necessary. The old implementation did work fine within limits and 
already has support for all architectures, so why should I just throw it 
away? Why was it not possible to first fix the problems of the old system?

So far you explained nothing and if you would just read and try to 
understand that damned mail(*), you would know, that I already said that 
the complexity is "exactly the same as before". I'm comparing it to other 
solutions, which you obviously haven't understood.

Thanks for another detailed explaination. :(

Well, if you don't even try to understand, what Al is trying to tell you, 
I'm afraid I can't help you either.

I seriously consider to take over modules maintainership, but I have 
neither the energy nor the time to do this alone, so I can only wish 
everyone much fun with modules during 2.6.
