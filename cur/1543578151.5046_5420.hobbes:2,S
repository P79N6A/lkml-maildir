thats what TUX 2.0 does. (it does async reads at the moment.)

well - if you think it's trivial (ie. no process context, no helper thread
will be needed), more power to you. How are you going to assure that the
issuing process does not block during the bmap()? [without extensive
lowlevel-FS changes that is.]

(i'm using it for reads only.)
