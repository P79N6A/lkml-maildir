This is only because of the terms of GPL. Morally, as many here have
pointed out this should fall into the same category.

Atleast we try and report genuine bugs and submit patches when
necessary. We get abuse however because it is not clear what the terms
of GPL are WRT loadable modules. If this were written in black and
white and we knew what we were fighting against, this would not be an
issue. We only get crap because no one here yet knows how to interpret
proprietary modules loaded into the kernel.
