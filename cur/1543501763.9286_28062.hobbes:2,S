IMHO, we need re-writes and tighter organization of most sections of
what is available online, in the sources and in the LDP --- and we
just obtained approval for a new book project on kernel programming.
If anyone here is of the same mind and would like to take on a short
contract to write (or edit) tech tutorials for the 2.2/2.3 kernel
internals, vm and networking code (and retain rights to donate your
work back into the LDP) please let me know asap.
