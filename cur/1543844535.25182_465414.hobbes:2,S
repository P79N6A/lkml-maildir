Subject: [BUGFIX][PATCH] cpu to node relationship fixup take2 [1/2] acpi_map_cpu2node
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I rewrote the whoe patch..
Problem description:
We have additional_cpus= option for allocating possible_cpus. But nid for
possible cpus are not fixed at boot time. cpus which is offlined at boot 
or cpus which is not on SRAT is not tied to its node.
This will cause panic at cpu onlining.
Changelog V1 -> V2
- divded patch into 2 pathces.
- move cpu_to_node relationship fixup before cpu onlining.
Tested on ia64/NUMA system, which has *physical* node-hot-add function.
Future work:  node-hot-add by cpu-hot-add.
-Kame
==
In usual, pxm_to_nid() mapping is fixed at boot time by SRAT.
But, unfortunatelly, some system (my system!) do not include
full SRAT table for possible cpus. (Then, I use additiona_cpus= option.)
For such possible cpus, pxm<->nid should be fixed at hot-add.
We now have acpi_map_pxm_to_node() which is also used at boot. It's suitable
here.
