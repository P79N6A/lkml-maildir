Hello!
This is yet another update of the RCU priority-boosting patch
(see 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/24/294
 for the previous version).
This series contains the RCU-boost patch itself and rcutorture
modifications to test it more thoroughly.  This version incorporates
feedback from Josh Triplett and applies cleanly to 2.6.20-rc6-rt6.
						Thanx, Paul
