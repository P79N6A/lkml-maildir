EVERY assertion you make is a complete falsehood,
and you know it. Spreading FUD, no more. I just
can't believe you're really that dumb.

Big fat complete lie.

Big fat complete lie.

Big fat complete lie.

Big fat complete lie.

Big fat complete lie.

MAKEDEV is a hack, with no gaurantee of being right from kernel to kernel.

Big fat complete lie.
