Yes.

Well, pdflush appears to be doing very little on both 2.6.18 and
2.6.20-rc3. In both cases kswapd is consuming 10-20% of a CPU and
all of the pdflush threads combined (I've seen up to 7 active at
once) use maybe 1-2% of cpu time. This occurs regardless of the
dirty_ratio setting.
Cheers,
Dave.
