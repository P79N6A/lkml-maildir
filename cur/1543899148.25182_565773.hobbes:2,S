    That's exactly what I meant! People don't write good autotools
scripts because it's difficult to learn autoconf and automake and it's
almost impossible to master. It's more or less easy to write an autoconf
script, but it's not so easy to make it right, powerful and to honor
every configure switch, etc...

    Me too. I've learned a bit of CMake because I have my own building
system ("configure" compatible from the point of view of the packager),
but instead of adding new features I think I'm going to switch to CMake
fully.
