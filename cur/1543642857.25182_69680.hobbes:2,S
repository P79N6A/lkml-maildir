Actually, its a result of new bind9 behaviour.  Previous versions of
bind used the glue records from the upper level DNS servers.  bind9
no longer trusts this glue information and will go looking for the
records in the right zone.
I've been bitten by this when trying to mail someone (their domain
had the NS records but not the corresponding A records for their name
servers.)  BTinternet have also been bitten by this when they upgraded
to bind9.  Welcome to bind9. 8)
And the annoying thing is that people running the domains with the
problems will normally point you at some web based DNS checker that
only tests for half the things it should do, and they completely
believe its output as being 100% correct.  The typical response you
get is "It passes www.xyz.com's DNS tests, its your problem."
Its in the same problem space as getting everyone to accept ICMP
fragmentation needed messages, or getting ECN to work.
