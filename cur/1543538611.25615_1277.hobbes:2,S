	Bingo!
	ID 6 (The CD-RW drive) had disconnect disabled and synchronous
negotiation disabled.  All the other targets had them both enabled.  It's
not something I ever tinkered with, so it's always been that way and I was
burning CD's under 2.2.x just fine (I haven't used any of the 2.2.17pre
series).
	Setting disconnect to enabled seems to have solved both problems.
Nice shooting.  I've had this card for a couple of years but I think I
inherited it when another system was upgraded to 16 bit drives.  Guess
I should have checked the card settings.  I've got another system at the
office doing the exact same thing (burns CD's under 2.2.16 and bombs
consistantly with 2.3.* 2.4.*) and that's a Philips 4200 CDR drive.
Guess I'll check that out tomorrow.
	Many thanks!
