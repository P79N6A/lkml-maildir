Hi,
At work I have the pleasure ;) of working with a 2.1.125 Linux box.
(Don't ask.) It has got two 130MB swap partitions and locked hard
(after some time of heavy swapping) when I ran your 'OutOfMem test
program'. I waited for about half an hour to see if the machine would
get out of the trap, but, alas, I had to find the reset button. (This
machine has never crashed on me before.)
-Looks like a DoS-attack problem.
-Does not seem to be very new. (2.1.125)
