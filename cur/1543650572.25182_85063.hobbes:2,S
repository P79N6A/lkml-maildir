Yes, the patch stubs out inter_module_*, in favor of get_symbol() &
put_symbol().
This breaks the three users: one in drivers/mtd/ and two in
drivers/char/drm/.  I have a patch which fixes them (untested), or I
can simply put the inter_module_* code back in.

It's been around for a while.  Geert, Russell?

Haven't looked at it.

It's fairly old, but Peter Chubb said there was some vendor interest
for v. large devices.  Peter?

SAMBA needs them, which is why serious Samba boxes use XFS.  Tridge,

The controls are in driverfs etc, and that's always been in flux. 8(
The rest is v. small, basically extending ksoftirqd, workqueues and
migration threads to disable them.  Then it's all arch-specific.

They have, IIRC.  Interestingly, it was less invasive (existing source
touched) than the LVM2/DM patch you merged.

Good.  The big payoff is moving stuff out of the kernel, which can't
really be done in a stable series.
