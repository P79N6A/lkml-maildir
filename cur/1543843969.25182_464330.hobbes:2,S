I would guess that we might notice, for example, that the CPU supports 
FXSR (fxsave/fxrestor) through looking at cpuid, and then we have, for 
example:
    arch/i386/kernel/cpu/common.c: cpu_init() ->
	arch/i386/kernel/i387.c: mxcsr_feature_mask_init() ->
        if (cpu_has_fxsr) {
                memset(&current->thread.i387.fxsave, 0, sizeof(struct i387_fxsave_struct));
                asm volatile("fxsave %0" : : "m" (current->thread.i387.fxsave));
		...
ie we will do one of the fancy new instructions from kernel space (very 
early), because this path at no point even bothers to check whether it is 
supposed to even use hw FP at all.
You can try booting with "no387 nofxsr" to get rid of at least _that_ 
particular issue, but there might be other cases like that in the MMX 
code, for example ("nofxsr" should disable both the FXSR and XMM 
capabilities as far as the kernel is concerned).
If that works (or gets you further), we should just make "no387" disable 
FXSR by itself. 
Worth testing, and you can do it without even recompiling the kernel, 
since we already have that kernel command line flag.
