I have added a routine to "struct tty_driver" for restarting 
the RX interrupt after TTY_DONT_FLIP bit is cleared in 
read_chan().

        clear_bit(TTY_DONT_FLIP, &tty->flags);

               tty->driver.restart_rx(tty);

and in the interrupt routine I have disabled the RX interrupt, 
if TTY_DONT_FLIP is set.

            if (tty->flip.count >= TTY_FLIPBUF_SIZE)
            {
                info->IER &= ~UART_IER_RDI;
                serial_outp(info, UART_IER, info->IER);
                return;     // if TTY_DONT_FLIP is set
            }

and tty->driver.restart_rx() is:

static void rs_restart_rx(struct tty_struct *tty)
{
    struct async_struct *info = (struct async_struct

    unsigned long flags;
    if (serial_paranoia_check(info, tty->device, 
"rs_restart_rx"))
        return;
    save_flags(flags); cli();
    if (!(info->IER & UART_IER_RDI)) {
        info->IER |= UART_IER_RDI;
        serial_out(info, UART_IER, info->IER);
    }
    restore_flags(flags);

It seems to take to long time in read_chan(). Do you now what 
is the exact reason of locking the filp buffer with the 
TTY_DONT_FLIP flag? For a short look I would say the buffers 
are safe locked by the spinlock tty->read_lock.
