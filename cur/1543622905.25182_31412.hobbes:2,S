Hello,
Ok it seems with your patch against 2.4.19-pre1 I don't get those "state
D" processes, but my printer didn't print anything either, maybe is just
something setup related, I'll try to figure it out. I shall repeat some
more tests with rmap12g also. Btw I had the USB compiled as module and got
the printer up with "modprobe printer".
