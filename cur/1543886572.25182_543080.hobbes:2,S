It is an option. I had the gfp flags passed in to kmem_cache_create() in
mind for determining this but SLUB creates slabs differently and different
flags could be passed into kmem_cache_alloc() of course.

That would be an immediate solution.
Another alternative is that anti-frag used to also group high-order
allocations together and make it hard to fallback to those areas
for non-atomic allocations. It is currently backed out by the
patch dont-group-high-order-atomic-allocations.patch because
it was intended for rare high-order short-lived allocations
such as e1000 that are currently dealt with by MIGRATE_RESERVE
(bias-the-location-of-pages-freed-for-min_free_kbytes-in-the-same-max_order_nr_pages-blocks.patch)
. The high-order atomic groupings may help here because the high-order
allocations are long-lived and would claim contiguous areas.
The last alternative I think I mentioned already is to have the minimum
order kswapd reclaims as the same order SLUB uses instead of 0 so that
min_free_kbytes is kept at higher orders than current.
