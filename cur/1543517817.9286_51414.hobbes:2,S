Release v0.6 of the built-in Kernel Debugger for linux (kdb)
is now available on

This release is against the 2.2.13 kernel tree.  I'm currently
backporting it to 2.2.5 for folks using the redhat 6.0 
release kernel distribution, it should be available soon.
This is the last scheduled release of kdb for the 2.2 kernel series.
The next release of kdb, hopefully sometime in December, will be 
version v1.0, and will be restructured to support multiple architectures
with initial support for ia32, mips and ia64 (ia64 code is subject to 
NDA restrictions at this time).
Please address comments, bug-fixes and enhancment requests to 
the kdb mailing list (kdb@oss.sgi.com).
Release v0.6 supports the following new features and bugfixes. 
    Much better support for SMP systems, including use of NMI to force
    all processors into the kernel debugger independent of the interrupt
    state of the processor.   Once all processors have stopped, no 
    interrupts are necessary to switch the kernel debugger between
    processors.
    Better breakpoint handling on multiprocessor systems.  Simultaneous
    breakpoints (e.g. bpa schedule) on multiple processors will 
    be handled serially by the kernel debugger.
    Pentium and PentiumPRO machine check exception handling. 
    Invoke KDB upon NMI (for systems with NMI button, allows 
    debugging systems when all interrupts are disabled).  
    Somewhat better keyboard handling.   I haven't encountered the 
    keyboard hang with this release, but I don't guarantee it has
    been fixed.   The garbage characters leftover have been fixed, however.
    New 'sr' command to call MAGIC_SYSRQ functions (Thanks Adegawa Masahiro).
    Handle symbols with MODVERSIONS tags (Thanks Adegawa Masahiro).
    Under some circumstances, spurious breakpoints would occur. This should
    be fixed.
    New loadable module commands to examine SCSI mid-layer data 
    structures (Scsi_Cmnd, Scsi_Disk, Scsi_Host) and to examine
    a struct file. 
    rm command can be used to alter debug register contents.
    Enhanced ps command to print process state and to show 
    current process as well as active processes on other processors.
    Space is no longer allocated in the kernel image for the symbol
    table when CONFIG_KDB=N, and the space requirement is computed
    dynamically when CONFIG_KDB=Y based upon the maximum number of
    symbols configured with make *config.
    General bugfixes.
