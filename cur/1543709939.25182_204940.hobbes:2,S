Hi Andrew,
	I had considered preemption and had thought using just
smp_processor_id() should be safe, since anyway the per-cpu kevent
thread is bound to its cpu alone.
Patch below is booted/tested against 2.6.4-rc2-mm1 on a 4-way x86 SMP box.
For testing, I basically called call_usermodehelper from inside a 
work function (activated using schedule_work) and checked that 
current_is_keventd() macro was returning true.
