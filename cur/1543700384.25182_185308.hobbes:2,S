Thanks Greg, that's what I figured.  Although the hotplug subsystem
could create the device nodes and then have kmod load the actual
drivers on open, I'm not convinced it's worth it for dynamic devices.
It's been argued that kmod should place a request with the hotplug
subsystem, rather than call modprobe, but that's a little too radical
for me just yet.
Cheers,
Rusty.
