In other email, Matt Mackall suggested a slightly different
integration with the kernel that would allow more general usage of the
CRC32C.  His suggestion was to put the implementation under /lib, next
to the crc32 routines, and make the crypto routine a wrapper that calls
it.  Selecting the CRYPTO_CRC32C module would SELECT the lib CRC32C
module, in other words.
The benefit of this would be to allow easy usage by other routines
(with no premption side-affects, a concern Matt has) while still being
there for routines that process scatterlist.  And the table/code is
still in one place.
Patch to follow in a day or two, after I can test it.  Implementation
was simple.
