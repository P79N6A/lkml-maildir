That is most likely udev related, which doesn't really like module names 
and default interface names changing for a known MAC address, depending on 
your distribution (the following example assumes debian sid, udev 0.114-2) 
you might have something like /etc/udev/rules.d/z25_persistent-net.rules 
(which lists MAC addresses and the associated persistent interface name), 
removing the corresponding stanza for your Broadcom wireless card (or 
removing the whole file alltogether and letting udev (or rather 
z45_persistent-net-generator.rules) recreate it during the next boot will 
most likely fix it. 
This issue is in no way b43 related, it happens with "every" networking 
devices with changing module names (at least for every legacy wireless 
module being replaced by a new mac80211 based driver).
