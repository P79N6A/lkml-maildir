the specific reason is that kernel 2.4 is in a maintainance mode and 
such changes are not considered being worth the risk of breaking 
anything anywhere with any of the supported gcc versions.
In kernel 2.6, this is already handled the way you expect it.

Users are not expected to manually set any CFLAGS.
It might work in your case, but unless you _really_ know what you are 
doing you always risk some breakage.
