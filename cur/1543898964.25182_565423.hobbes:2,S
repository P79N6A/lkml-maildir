Some distros (Debian and SuSE I think) split the e2fsprogs libraries
into separate packages so that you are not depending on "e2fsprogs",
but rather "libuuid" and/or "libblkid".

In fact, Eric Sandeen and I discussed splitting the xfsprogs "libdisk"
(or similar, it detects RAID geometry for DM/MD/etc) into a standalone
library so that e2fsprogs could use it.  The only issue is the increased
maintenance and packaging of separate libraries.
