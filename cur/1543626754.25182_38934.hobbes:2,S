OTOH, we might be better off taking ->i_sem in all callers of notify_change().
There's only 10 of them, so it's not too much work and that would have a
benefit of allowing to do things like suid removal on write(2) in a right way.
Hmm...  While we are at it, why don't we remove suid/sgid on truncate(2)?
