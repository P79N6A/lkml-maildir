Every scsi harddisk? I do not think *all* of them have upgradable
firmware.
Every PC bios? I believe many manufacturers are clever enough to
require jumper.
If hardware is so crappy it is possible to kill it ... well ... I
believe it is at least bugtraq topic.

They were the first where breaking hardware by software is so easy
that it happens by accident. That's looks like good enough reason to
pick on them.
