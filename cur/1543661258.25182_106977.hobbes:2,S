Hi
there's a race condition in filesystem
let's have a two inodes that are placed in the same buffer.
call fsync on inode 1
it goes down to ext2_update_inode [update == 1]
it calls ll_rw_block at the end
ll_rw_block starts to write buffer
ext2_update_inode waits on buffer
while the buffer is writing, another process calls fsync on inode 2
it goes again to ext2_update_inode
it calls ll_rw_block
ll_rw_block sees buffer locked and exits immediatelly
ext2_update_inode waits for buffer
the first write finished, ext2_update_inode exits and changes made by
second proces to inode 2 ARE NOT WRITTEN TO DISK.
This bug causes that when you simultaneously fsync two inodes in the same
buffer, only the first will be really written to disk.
