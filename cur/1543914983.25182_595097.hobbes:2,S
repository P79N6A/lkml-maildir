Subject: [PATCH 092/104] KVM: VMX: Fix exit qualification width on i386
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: He, Qing <qing.he@intel.com>
According to Intel Software Developer's Manual, Vol. 3B, Appendix H.4.2,
exit qualification should be of natural width. However, current code
uses u64 as the data type for this register, which occasionally
introduces invalid value to VMExit handling logics. This patch fixes
this bug.
I have tested Windows and Linux guest on i386 host, and they can boot
successfully with this patch.
