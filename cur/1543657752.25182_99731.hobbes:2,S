It's never been part of the standard kernel distribution. Your distribution
probably has an extra patch compiled in in order to provide this.
It's IMO not very usefull: each distribution of a compiled kernel should
just include a seperate file containing the .config, just like it contains
seperate modules. The prefered name is $IMAGENAME.config, where $IMAGENAME
is the name of the installed kernel image. No need to bloat the kernel with
this information, IMHO.
I'd love to see a patch which copies the .config to /vmlinuz.config on a
standard make {zlilo|bzlilo|install} though.
(yes, I know that the .config won't be available on a bootfloppy without a
fs. Then again, on a bootfloppy /with/ fs, there won't be space for a
.config...)
