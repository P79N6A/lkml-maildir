I got to the flame war late and only saw your comment that stable API should
be discouraged.  That kind of thinking pisses me off because it assumes all
modules out of the tree are that way because the authors want them out of the
tree.  I also understand that sometimes API needs to change, but please don't
encourage change just to punish other authors, be they proprietary or otherwise.
As for what type of EXPORT macro to use I surely don't have anything to
say that hasn't been said multiple times before.
