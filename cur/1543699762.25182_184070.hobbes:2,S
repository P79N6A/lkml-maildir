Good news : )  it's not test11 that fails...
Sorry to say: This have been some sort of false alarm - 
although the problem still exists.
When I wrote "the disk is readed perfectly with kernel 2.4.x" I referred to 
tests on another machine that is running with kernel 2.4.23.
This other machine reads the disk perfectly even with test11 - 
so this is not a fd-problem of test11...
...it's a problem related to my hardware.
The "problem-machine" - with a mainboard ASUS A7V600 - does show the same 
disk-problems with kernel 2.4.x - probably because there is no support for 
the VIA KT600 chipset used on the board yet. I have experienced also problems 
with the serial port of the board that might or might not be related to the 
lack of support for the chipset.
I have attached the output of lspci (only the lines that are directly related 
to the mainboard itself)
