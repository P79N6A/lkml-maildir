Hi,
Attached is a very experimental driver for a Ricoh SD Card reader that can be 
found in some notebooks like the Samsung P35.
Whenever a sd card is inserted into one of these notebooks, a virtual pcmcia 
card will show up:
Socket 0:
  product info: "RICOH", "Bay1Controller", "", ""
  manfid: 0x0000, 0x0000
In order to write this driver I hacked qemu to have access to the cardbus 
bridge containing this card. I then logged the register accesses of the 
windows xp driver and tryed to analyse them.
As the meanings of most of the register are still unknown to me, I consider 
this driver very experimental. It is possible that this driver might destroy 
your data or your hardware. Use at your own risk! 
Other problems:
- I only implemented reading support
- I only tested with a 128 MB SD card, no idea what would be needed to support
  other card types
- irqs are not supported
- dma is not supported
- it is very slow
- the registers can be found on the cardbus bridge and not on the virtual 
  pcmcia card. The cardbus bridge is already claimed by yenta_socket. 
  Therefore the driver currently uses pci_find_device to find the cardbus
  bridge containing the sd card reader registers.
- it will probably crash when you remove the sd card without unmounting first
- the ios stuff is not really understood
- there are a bunch of extra MMC_APP_CMDs inside the driver
- only tested with kernel 2.6.18
apart from all these problems reading an image from my sd card seems to have 
worked ;) 
If you are still brave enough to try it out make at least a backup of the data 
on your sd card.
Feedback is highly appreciated.
Regards
Sascha
