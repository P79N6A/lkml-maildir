Subject: [RFC patch] firewire: add Kconfig help on building both stacks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/25/260

Alas that won't work so good, because nobody reads help texts.
I thought about adding some crude multiple choice selection (build the
old stack, build the new stack, build both stacks).  It's possible, but
it would introduce awkward dummy config variables.

+	  This is the "Juju" FireWire stack, a new alternative implementation
 	  designed for robustness and simplicity.  You can build either this
