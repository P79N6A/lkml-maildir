I tryed your test program and got correct results, a file with bytes 11-16385 being zero.
I will try to give a description of my problems:
after a reboot inn is 're-using' existing messages to store new
messages. It seems that after a renumber command the active file 
is correced again. I have not checked to see if the active file
was corrutped before. 
I am using a plain stock kernel, no other patches what so ever,
but am using LVM. 
The blocksize the ext2 filesystem is using is 1024.
