The usual problem with "no overcommit" is that it is grossly wasting
swap space.  The typical example is system(3) which does a fork+exec(/bin/sh):
if you call it from a 500MB process, you temporarily need another 500MB
of swap even though it will never really be needed (since it's cow-shared).
Of course, swap space is cheap, so it's not necessarily such a big issue,
but on the other hand, the cases where a half-clever OOM-killer doesn't
cut the mustard are rather far and few apart.
