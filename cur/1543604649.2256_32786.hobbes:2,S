Better static (less overhead in size and at runtime), initialized at build
time (you could compute it then). In case of _dire_ kernel size problems, it
can be left out anyway. AFAIU, there are now a _lot_ of copies of this
around, so you'll win overall in any case.

KISS: Keep It Simple, Stupid. Unless it won't cut it, that is.
