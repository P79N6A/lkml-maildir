Hi.
POSIX states that the credentials (uid, gid, capabilities, etc.) are
process-wide. So when one thread within the process changes some part
of the credentials, all threads see the change.
But, the credentials are per-task in Linux, so it's possible to have
two tasks in a process running under different UIDs.
It may have problems when we change UID/GID in one task within the
thread group.
How to deal with it? Will Linux kernel move credentials into a shared
structure?
Thank you.
