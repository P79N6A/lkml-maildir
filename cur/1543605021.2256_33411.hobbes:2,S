Previous message sent too soon.
The patch makes two attempts at dumping registers, one for the original
oops and one if die() fails, then it gives up.  The second attempt is
useful for diagnosing why die() is failing, without that data it is
difficult to fix die() itself.
I was aiming to improve error handling in the rare case that die()
failed so we could get better diagnostics in the long term, by fixing
the problems that make die() fail.  If you think that this would scroll
away useful data then we can compromise.
	if (++die_lock_owner_depth < 2+(CONFIG_DIAGNOSE_RECURSIVE_DIE+0)) {
CONFIG_DIAGNOSE_RECURSIVE_DIE
  If this variable is selected then the kernel will attempt to provide
  extra diagnostics in the rare cases when the kernel die() routine
  itself dies.  This may cause useful information from the first
  failure to be lost.  Unless you want to diagnose the die() and
  show_regs() code in the kernel, say N here.
Acceptable?
