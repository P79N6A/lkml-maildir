It didn't work either way. 
Last night I did a couple more of experiments. They definitely show that
something weird was with egcs shipping with RH60.
I booted 2.2.7 kernel compiled earlier under RH5.2 (gcc 2.7.2.3), ide-cd
as a module--no problem. ide-cd.c hasn't changed since 2.2.7, it's the
same in 2.2.9 as in 2.2.7. Then I noticed that ide-cd.o compiled under
RH60 had different (bigger) size than that one from 2.2.7. 
I was already thinking of falling back to gcc 2.7.2.3 and then gave it one
more try with egcs shipped in RH60. To make my experiment cleaner I did
'make mrproper', compiled the kernel and for some mysterious reason the
problem with loading ide-cd.o disappeared. I also noticed that the size of
ide-cd.o changed. It is still bigger than when compiled with gcc 2.7.2.3
but less than that of ide-cd.o failing to load.
