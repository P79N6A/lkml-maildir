Quite true.  But once again, a well-written DDX will attempt to minimize 
any busy-waiting it does.  I can't remember if I'm thinking of the 
Matrox or Radeon drivers in XFree86, but they have code to do DMA, so 
all they do is fill up a buffer and go to sleep waiting on an ioctl. 
(I'm making an inference here, but isn't this what the DRM drivers are 
all about?)  The only time this doesn't work is when the drawing engine 
doesn't support the particular operation being done (or the DDX doesn't 
support it), and it's counter-productive to try to have mi reduce it to 
spans, or the drawing engine doesn't support DMA or interrupts.
