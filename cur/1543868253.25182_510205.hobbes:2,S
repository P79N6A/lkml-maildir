Hi Paul,
I could benefit from knowing which driver and display device you are
considering to be applicable.
I was thinking the method used in hecubafb would only be useful to
devices with very slow update paths, where "losing" some of the
display activity is not an issue since the device would not have been
able to update fast enough to show that activity anyway.
What you described with chained DMA sounds different to this. I
suppose one could use this technique to coalesce framebuffer IO to get
better performance/utilization even for fast display devices. Sounds
interesting to try. Did I understand you correctly?
Thanks,
jaya
