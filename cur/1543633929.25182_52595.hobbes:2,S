It would not be impossibly difficult to remove the recursion altogether.
As far as I can see, the cycle essentially is
link_path_walk -> do_follow_link -> page_follow_link -> vfs_follow_link ->.
Now page_follow_link does very little after the vfs_follow_link call,
and the same holds for all other filesystem types.
Either foo_follow_link ends in
	return vfs_follow_link(..);
or it does
	err = vfs_follow_link(..);
	if (something_to_free)
		free_it;
	return err;
With a little bit of polishing we could cut off all foo_follow_link
routines just before the vfs_follow_link call and make foo_follow_link
return the arguments it was going to call vfs_follow_link with.
Then of course the something_to_free must be freed by the caller.
What is it?
page_follow_link and nfs_follow_link have
        if (page) {
                kunmap(page);
                page_cache_release(page);
        }
jffs2_follow_link has
	kfree(buf);
If that is done, there is no stack frame for foo_follow_link,
and in principle the three of link_path_walk, do_follow_link,
vfs_follow_link could be single routine. Today do_follow_link
is already inline.
Now symlink resolution can be entirely iterative.
The routine that does this works on a linked list of things
still to consider, and always works on the tail of the list.
Quite a lot of restructuring would be required to produce
a readable source in this style, but it doesn't look too difficult.
The result might even be more efficient.
