How about mount for nfs-root, a shell and a shell script to supply the
correct parameters to mount so it doesn't go and try to mount the
nfs-root with locking enabled - oh, and a few programs like sed and
so forth to pull the mount parameters out of the dhcp client output,
if there is such an output.
ipconfig.c does more than just configure networking.  It's a far smaller
solution to NFS-root than any userspace implementation could ever hope
to be.
