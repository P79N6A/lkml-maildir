I did not follow the ext3 development recently, how did you solve
the "read-only mount(2) (optionally on write protected media)" issue ?
Does the mount fail, or does the code virtually replays (without writing)
only ?
I think any other action (only replaying on rw mount and presenting
a broken filesystem on ro) is quite fatal, at least if I think of
a replay on -remount,rw :)
Also, an unconditional hidden replay even if "ro" is specified is not nice.
This is especially critical on root filesystem, because there is IMHO
no way to specify mount arguments to the "/" mount, except ro/rw.
