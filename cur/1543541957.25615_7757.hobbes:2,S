It's done to have all drivers that use the new input layer in one place.

The configuration problems were only a side-effect of having the input stuff
spread around in the tree.

It could be done. But having related drivers in one place is the
cleaner solution (IMHO).

Having the usb storage stuff in drivers/scsi seems not too ugly to me.
The general problem is (and it is already discussed in this thread) having
a proper scheme for drivers/. Currently there is no scheme.
IMHO there are three appronpinquate shemes:
  1. Group drivers by the subsystem they belong to:
	drivers/usb
	drivers/scsi
	drivers/ide
  2. Group drivers by their interface and function. Examples:
	drivers/input
	drivers/sound
	drivers/video
  2. Group drivers by the bus they are on. Examples::
	drivers/scsi	(the real scsi drivers, not the scsi controller)
	drivers/i2c	(the i2c clients only)
and additionally:
	driver/pci	for pci drivers (not the pci subsystem!)
	drivers/isa	for isa drivers
	drivers/ic	for bus independend drivers
	drivers/pseudo	for pseudo devices
In my opinion 3.) is the best solution. But following at least one
of this alternatives strictly would make the tree a lot cleaner.
