Ummm. this might be silly, but shouldn't those announcements come from
the lieutenants?
Linus has announced who he accepts patches frin, and who will be doing the 2.0,
2.2, and 2.4 maintenance. It would seem logical to have those lieutenants
announce their maintainers.
How would Linus actually know who, (after his lieutenants) SHOULD send mail
to the lieutenants?
That is the problem in the first place...
It would help to have the information in the MAINTAINERS file though. As well
as the auxilary mailing lists supporting that activity. That way, users
who find a bug/create a patch/whatever would have an easier time locating
where to send the patch. Especially when it doesn't directly affect the
core kernel.
