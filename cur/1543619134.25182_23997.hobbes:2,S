Ah, didn't know that.

Yes.  This feature might be useful to grab back a few cycles at the expense 
of some extra complexity.  It is not however, a fundamental change to my 
algorithm, just a decoration of it.  It's also possible that the cost of the 
resulting extra fault will wipe out the (small) saving of setting pte entries 
RO in the average case.
It's likely there are architectures where this won't work, and just not doing 
this optimization is the correct approach.
