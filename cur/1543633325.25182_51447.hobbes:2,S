Hi,

Yes, there is and it is attached to the SCSI layer via the sbp2 driver. 
You need following set of modules to get it working:
scsi_mod, sd_mod, ohci1394, raw1394, ieee1394, sbp2
I know that you will find out which options you need to enable in the 
kernel config ;).
You might want to check out the CVS version of the ieee1394 drivers but 
I don't think it is necessary. It works perfectly back here with a 
Maxtor 160GB. Funny enough I had 158GB with the VFAT on it and 152GB 
with ext2/ext3.
The speed results were also quite interessing:
VFAT writing     : 12.8 Mbyte/s
ext2/ext3 writing: 19.2 Mbyte/s
I simply like that disk and it's a nice extension for a laptop :).
Cheers,
Roberto Nibali, ratz
