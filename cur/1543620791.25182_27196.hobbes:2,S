I don't have a fix for this directly, but the slow speed can be fixed on
many Promise controllers with hdparm. Testing the transfer rate of some of
my mature (ATA/66) drives, I find that raising the transfer rate from 3MB
to 14MB is often possible after setting the options.
NOTE: wrong options will hose your data! WHich is why I don't tell you
what to use, just look at -m -c (I use 3), -d and -X34. Again, it may bite
you, have backups.
