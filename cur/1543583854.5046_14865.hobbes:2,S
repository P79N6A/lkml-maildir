Do large numbers of entries hurt? I have an application that when
running for a while ends up with over 2000 entries in /proc/$$/maps
because of the way it works... that is paging is more efficient that
the application swapping data out; so it continually grows until it
can no longer at which point it falls back to using it's own poor
LRU, typically means you get a single process of around 2.9GB.
Everything appears to work... but it does seem a bit clunky that
there are so many vma chunks.
Perhaps the argument here is that glibc or the application should be
fixed?
