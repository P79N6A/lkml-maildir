Do you know ulimits are a *process* property, not uid property?
That is, if, in some process of a giving user, you set ulimit value,
it does NOT affect other processes of the same user already running
at the same time, but only new processes forked off of this process
where you've set the limit.  Limits are inheritable from parent to
child, but not the reverse and especially they don't "migrate" to
"brothers" or "brothers-in-law".

It's because of the way ulimit works - on Linux and on other systems.
When you set limit of number of processes in some session, you can't
fork more processes *in this session* if total number of processes of
this user is >= the limit value you set.  Other sessions are unaffected.
It's unclear what did you mean by ``i have set "ulimit -u 100"''.
Where did you set it?
Note also that when you log in (on a terminal, or over ssh, or using su
command), the limits are usually set to whatever specified for that user
in /etc/security/limits.conf - so for example, if you set a limit and
use su to change uid, your limit is reset.
