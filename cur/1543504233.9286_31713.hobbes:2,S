Yeah, I understand. Actually, my development OS options are Linux and DOS
(where I know I could just handle interrupts from userspace, because
everything is userspace :). Guess which one I chose ... ;)

Yes. How to clear the interrupt is a especially interesting one, because:
- each device has its own way of clearing it (how would you define the
  driver interface so that the application is able to tell, from
  userspace, how to clear the interrupt, and it's general enough to work
  with _any_ device??).
- you would have to clear it _before_ you actually service it, otherwise
  you'll be stuck on the driver intr. handler and, thus, it'll be
  impossible to service it from userspace. But since you haven't serviced
  it, the interrupt would probably happen again, and then ... :)

Let's say we have this driver. How should the application and the driver
interface ?? You've mentioned a blocking call. Could you give an example
of that for this particular (hypothetic) case ?? I've also heard of using
a task queue for that. Do you know anything about how to use it ?!?!
Thanks much for your comments so far.
