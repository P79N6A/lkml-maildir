Adding a few more fixmap slots wouldn't hurt anyone.  But if you want an
arbitrarily large number of them then no, we cannot do that.
Taking more than one sleeping kmap at a time within the same process is
deadlocky, btw.  You can end up with N such tasks all holding one kmap and
waiting for someone else to release one.
Possibly one could arrange for the pages to not be in highmem at all.
