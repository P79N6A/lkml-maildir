| 
| Hi
| Edited lilo.conf so I can boot either kernel-2.6.0-test2
| (default) or kernel-2.4.21, using hda1.
| 
| lpr a small file, no print. ctrl-alt-del and rebooted using
| 2.4.21, file printed. Checked the two config files and could
| not find any difference in this area.
| 
| Printer is a Panasonic dot-matrix running in text mode.
| Also using patch bk5.
Is "Parallel Printer support" built into your kernel or built as a
module?  If built as a module, are you sure that the module is
loaded?  If modular, please provide contents of /proc/modules
when you try to print.
