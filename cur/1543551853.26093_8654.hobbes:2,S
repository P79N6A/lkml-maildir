Ok, so it claims that we're doing IO on an unmapped buffer. So far so
good..

[ etc ]
and the above is a perfectly fine backtrace, makes tons of sense, looks
good.
HOWEVER. What doesn't make any sense at all is that bread() calls getblk()
to find the buffer, which in turn certainly makes sure that the buffer it
tries to read is mapped. In fact, there are two paths to the read: one
finds the buffer off the hash queue, and the other creates it. The one
that creates the buffer explicitly marks it BH_Mapped, so the only
apparent source of problems would be the hash queue.
Except for the fact that the only thing that adds buffers to the hash
queue is __insert_into_queues(), and the only thing that calls THAT is
getblk() itself - again after having marked the buffer mapped.
In short, the debug trace looks fine, but it also looks completely
incomprehensible. The only thing that would strike me is
 - memory corruption
 - somebody calls "unmap_buffer()" in a buffer that is hashed. Which we
   used to have as a bug, but we definitely don't do that any more.
 - we have buffer head list corruption going on.
Now, I don't see any recent code that has touched anything like this,
which obviously doesn't mean anything at all. It might be a very old bug
that just hasn't reared its head before now.
Al, do you see anything wrong?
Udo, any idea what you are doing differently than anybody else to see
this thing? Any special usage patterns that seem to bring on the trouble?
