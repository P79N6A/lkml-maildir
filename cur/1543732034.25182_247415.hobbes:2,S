Granted, we have some free wiggle room in page->flags right now, but
using another bit effectively shifts the entire benefit of your patch. 
Instead of getting rid of the buddy bitmaps, you simply consume a
page->flag instead.  While you don't have to allocate anything (because
of the page->flags use), the number of bits consumed in the operation is
still the same as before.  And the patch is getting more complex by the
minute.
Something ate your patch:
