No, I think it's the module ordering again.

I wish users stopped this filtering, it's a very bad idea.
As it is, there's no message showing when ehci_hcd was loaded.
We can try piece together the picture:

was ehci here? We don't know but I bet it was, because:

This one seems far shorter. The EHCI comes online late here as well,
but not as late as in the "regression" case. I am wondering if we
