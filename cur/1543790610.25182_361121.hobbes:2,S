As of 2.6.14-git-current ipw2200 would not bind to a ethX name.
In other words, ieee80211-1.0.7 and ipw2200-1.0.8 are making and 
installing perfectly, also ipw2200 module is getting loaded but nothing 
will come up for wireless under iwconfig nor under ifconfig -a.
dmesg looked perfectly normal. Maybe this has anything to do with the 
Greg KH changes?
(2.6.14-rc5 and I have heard 2.6.14 work perfectly)
Also, how can I debug or check what could be occuring? or should I just 
wait because there are too many things going in?
