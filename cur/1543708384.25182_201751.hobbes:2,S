I wonder about X though. It uses mmio for accels (in the non fbdev case
though) and needs to map the memory area for fallback case, like the non
supported bressenham lines on permedia 2/3 for example. Altough it is
possible that the fact that X does its own mapping, and anyway, has very
little interaction with fbcon and fbdev anyway.
