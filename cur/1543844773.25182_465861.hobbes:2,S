Subject: [-mm PATCH] RCU: various patches
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patchset consists of various merge candidates that would
do well to have some testing in -mm. This patchset breaks
out RCU implementation from its APIs to allow multiple
implementations, gives RCU its own softirq and finally
lines up preemptible RCU from -rt tree as a configurable
RCU implementation for mainline. Published earlier and
re-diffed against -mm.
They have been tested lightly using combinations of
rcutorture, dbench, kernbench and ltp (both CONFIG_CLASSIC_RCU=y and 
CONFIG_RCU_PREEMPT=y) on x86 and ppc64.
Thanks
Dipankar
