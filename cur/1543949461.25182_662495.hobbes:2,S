The fact that powertop says that it has an average residency of 200 ms in C2 tells me that those should have been spent in C3.
I like the patch in principle, although I think the threshold should
be configurable, not hard coded.
I haven't checked in detail if that is the case, but you need to make
sure that you only reference jiffies on idle exit after the clock
source has caught up with lost jiffies after idle. That might be 
the cause of your problem.
