The fix worked for me.  But as I noted, the lspci output changed and
going back I see the PCI-X bridge went AWOL, though the the SCSI
controller (part of that bug) is PCI-X non-bridge anyway.  Also I tested
this with the SLES kernel which IIRC has mmconfig off by default.  So
Jeff, I am interested to hear how your testing goes.
