Sure.  First I wonder whether it would be possible to kill nr_free_pages()
and nr_free_highpages() (or infact all of the nr_free*page() functions)
in favour of the per-node ones, externalizing the for loop.  Or if there
are to many users at least make them use the per-node version.
Second I wonder whether nr_free_pages_node() and nr_free_highpages_node()
should take a pgdat instead of a node id as the caller has it around anyway.
Also I think the per-node info should be in /proc/meminfo even for UMA
machines, it doesn't hurt but makes it more consistant.
