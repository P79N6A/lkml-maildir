Hmm.  You don't even need to do a 'find'.  When my server goes down, the
client becomes completely hosed.  I can't login, run a bloody thing, nor
perform a normal shutdown.  All it does is periodically scroll messages
about "..Can't get a request slot.." on the console until terminated and
rebooted via sysreq.  
The server is mounted as "hard, intr", but damned if I can actually
interrupt the failed RPC call.
