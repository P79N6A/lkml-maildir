Are you using RedHat 5.2?  If so then you should consider moving over to kernel
2.2.x.  I currently use kernel 2.2.3 on a RedHat 5.2 system and am able to
reliable write data to and receive data from my IDE tape drive using SCSI
emulation.  However, I don't use SCSI emulation for the other EIDE devices. 
Things like my hard drives and cdroms I use the EIDE drivers.  
Put a tape in the drive and then issue the command:
$mt -f /dev/st0 reten
That should retension the tape and test the communications between the drive
and the driver.  Post any messages you get.
