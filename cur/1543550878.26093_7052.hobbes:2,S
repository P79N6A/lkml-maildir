Hi,
I reported this problem before but didn't get any answers so I'm posting
again.
After starting 2 processes that scan a lot of files (diff, find,
slocate, ...) it's impossible to run any other processes that touch 
the disk, they will stall until one of the first two stop. Could this be
a sign of starvation in the elevator code?
This is a UP machine, 64 Mb, IDE disks, kernel 2.4.0-test9 (final). If I
can help with further details just ask.
Rui Sousa
