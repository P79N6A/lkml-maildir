I knew you were waiting for this, so I just wanted to let you know that 
the kstrdup function is already available in Linus tree 2.6.13-rc1. It 
is declared linux/string.h and implemented in mm/slab.c.
It is not implemented in lib/string.c because some architectures use lib 
functions in their bootloading code where the allocation functions are 
not available, and the linking stage then fails because of the kmalloc 
reference :P
