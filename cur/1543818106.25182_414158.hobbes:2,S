Well, > 32 busses or just one busid value >= 32.

I think that the kernel init code should detect and prevent the
data corruption.  Here's a patch to do that, by ignoring busses
whose busid value is too large.

Prevent possible table overflow and unknown data corruption.
Code is in an __init section so it will be discarded after init.
