     (This is for IPv4, someone would have to check IPv6 as well).
     The socket flag O_NONBLOCK is _NOT_ properly inherited through an
     accept(2) call, in spite of what socket(7) documents. This is a bug.
     accept(2) must copy the file descriptor's flag of the socket.
The socket(7) manpage is buggy, not the kernel.
This has been this way forever, it is thus an API and it is not
changing.  Changing it would break existing programs.  End of story.
Later,
