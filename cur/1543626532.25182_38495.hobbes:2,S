Subject: [PATCH 2.5.8-pre1] nbd compile fixes...
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

In 2.5.8-pre1 include/linux/nbd.h a struct member name was changed
from 'queue_lock' to 'tx_lock', with the comment "nbd compile fix"
from Dave Jones.
In fact, since nbd.c still reference 'queue_lock' I suspect that
the actual modifications to nbd.c were lost somewhere in etherspace
between Dave and Linus.
Either provide the right fix for nbd.c or apply the attached patch,
which reverts the patch to nbd.h.
In other words, the attached patch provides a "nbd compile fix" by
reverting the previous "nbd compile fix" :-)
Stelian.
