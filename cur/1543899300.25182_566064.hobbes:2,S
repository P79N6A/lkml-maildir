==================== Changes in man-pages-2.61 ====================
Changes to individual pages
---------------------------
intro.2
    mtk
       Rewrite to reflect the fact that the _syscallN
       macros are no longer available.
select.2
    mtk
        Noted that 'timeout' can also be changed if select() is
        interrupted by a signal.
swapon.2
    Ivana Varekova  / mtk
        Update text for EPERM error describing the maximum number of
        swap files.  (From downstream Fedora patch.)
write.2
    mtk
        Added details about seekable files and file offset.
        Noted that write() may write less than 'count' bytes, and
        gave some examples of why this might occur.
        Noted what happens if write() is interrupted by a signal.
