I agree with you that it ought to be configureable. But if you set it to
something like 100 it is _not_ deterministic in practise. I.e. during your
tests you have a really hard time making 100 readers at the critical
point. Most likely you only have a handfull. Then when you deploy the
system where you might have a webserver presenting data read under a
rw-lock is overloaded spawns 100 worker tasks. Bang! Your RT application
doesn't run!
It doesn't help you to have something bounded if the bound is insanely
high such you never reach it in tests. And if you try to calculate the
worst case scenarious for such a system you would find it doesn't
schedule. I.e. you have to buy a bigger CPU or do some other drastic
thing!
A limit like 1 reader per CPU on the other hand behaves like a
normal mutex priority inheritance wrt. determinism. And it scales like the
stock Linux rw-lock which in practise is also limited to 1 task per CPU as
preemption is switched off :-)

Well, these kind of things isn't something you want to combine with 3d
graphics right away anyway!
I have even had problems with crashing on 2.4.xx with a NVidia and
hyperthreading on a machine I helped install :-( 
I am afraid NVidia cards and preempt realtime is far in the future :-(
