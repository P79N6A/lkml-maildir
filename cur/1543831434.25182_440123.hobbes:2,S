[I think the following discussion is about ams_show_xyz, not
ams_mouse_show_mouse.]

I don't know what a software will be doing with it, but "displacement"
(and its time derivatives "velocity", "acceleration", "jerk") is a
vector. Why not write the component-wise representation of the vector
into a single sysfs attribute? Especially if this keeps the kernel code
simple and small. I suppose even userspace code which evaluates the
attribute is in many cases simpler (and more precise anyway) if only a
single attribute is used.
