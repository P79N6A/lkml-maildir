Still, many drivers still need the compat hash lookup to work
properly, and these still require -ENOIOCTLCMD to work properly.
So is it worth it wasting CPU cycles working around only part of the problem?
How about:
1. Adding a comment in fs.h
2. Changing unlocked_ioctl to behave in the same way as compat_ioctl
 (this will help since unlocked_ioctl will be well tested),
 something along the lines of my old patch below [its against 2.6.11-rc1-bk5].
As a bonus, I expect a small speedup in code using unlocked_ioctl
(as well as compat_ioctl) for datapath things like usb transfers.
Andy, if this sounds convincing, let me know and I'll build a real patch.
