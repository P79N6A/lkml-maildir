This wasn't my patch :)   But anyway, 2.4.x series is actually ahead of
2.5.x in terms of e100 bugfixes, owing to Linus's vacation.  If you use
 BitKeeper, you can obtain the latest by issuing
	bk pull 
http://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.4
or wait another day or so for Marcelo to release 2.4.21-pre4 :)
The 2.5 and 2.4 versions of e100 are kept in sync, so it is trivial to
take 2.4's e100 and use it in 2.5 [and vice versa].
