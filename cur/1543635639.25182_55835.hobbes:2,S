Why would you want that? AFAICS there are two kinds of "never
sleeping" functions: 1. those that don't sleep but don't care
about it and 2. those that must not sleep because a lock is
held.
For 1. no point marking it because it might change without
being a bug. You also don't want to mark every function
in the kernel SLEEPS() or NEVER_SLEEPS().
For 2. we already have MUST_HOLD(foo) or similar, which implicitly 
means it can never sleep. The same is true for functions
with spinlocks or preempt_disable around their body.
