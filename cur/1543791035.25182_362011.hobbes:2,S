It would have been helpful if you quoted the patch.
+#ifndef INITDATA
+#define INITDATA
+#endif
...
-static const u16 cplens[] = {
+static INITDATA u16 cplens[] = {
        3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 23, 27, 31,
        35, 43, 51, 59, 67, 83, 99, 115, 131, 163, 195, 227, 258, 0, 0
 };
etc..
I think for ARM, we can simply do -DINITDATA=const, yes?
