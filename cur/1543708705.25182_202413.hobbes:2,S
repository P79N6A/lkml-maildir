Isn't there a no joke in maintainers policy? Should be.

Bought by SBE. And the first cool action they placed on the
market was to substitute all occurrences of LMC in the driver
by SBE and make some other incompatible changes to make sure
that the old tools wouldn't work with the "new" driver and
vice versa. Surprisingly the kernel maintainers did not like
this very much so the drivers in the latest kernels are
somewhat old and conflicting with the "real" drivers.
What's more, their driver version 3.2 doesn't compile with
2.4.21 and up, so unless they've eventually released their
highquality patch/driver/tool/utilities/extras + telnet
and more bundle in version 4.0 version which will probably
only work up to 2.4.24 anyway (due to the latest HDLC
changes), one has to stick to an old version of the driver,
which works somewhat but given the extraordinary code quality
I would be very surprised if that's a synonym for a nice
uptime.
There's something about WAN card manufacturers that seems to
say: If you hate us for the sad driver quality, check back
with our competition and then come back later...
Who's up next: Sangoma?
