What's your modutils version ?  -> lsmod -V
You must use modutils and not modules-utils under 2.4, and I suspect
that if you jumped back from 2.6 to 2.4, you might not have the right
package. Note that modules-utils contains a wrapper to call the right
modutils when you are running 2.4, so you should really do lsmod -V
when running 2.4.
