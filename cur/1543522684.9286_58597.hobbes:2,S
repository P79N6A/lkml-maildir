Hi David,
my patch has great performance ( 80% with 300 tasks ) with a lot of tasks
and low overhead ( 1.5% with 2 tasks ).
And my patch has 0.00 optimizations about CPU fetches and Co.
IMVHO 1-1.5 % of overhead is a price the we can afford given the performace
with many tasks.
My patch equals the current implementation with 8 tasks.
Cheers,
    Davide.
