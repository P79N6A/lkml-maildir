Sorry, I could have picked a clearer example. You are correct - it doesn't
make sense to wake up more waiters than you can satify if you know this at
the time. As Paul mentioned, the idea here is that we may have freed
multiple buffers, and so we wake all the consumers and let them fight it out.
At least in DYNIX/ptx, semaphores are exclusively FIFO. This gives wake-one
semantics by default, and prevents starvation.

One general rule to remember is that if you need to take multiple locks, then
you need to always take them in the same order to avoid deadlocks. One
simple, if crude way of doing this if they're not two fixed locks is to
always take the lock with the lower address first. I don't know if this
will help in this case, but it looks like you probably have to play with
the rw locks for the wait queues to make this atomic.
