If possible, can you remove the hard disc from the promise and attach it on
the VIA-Controller and test if the problem still occurs? (prepare a bootdisc
if you cannot boot. Propably, you have to pass a new root-partition to the
kernel)
I hardly believe that the promise controller has some problems with the new
VIA setup introduced in 2.4.3-ac7. Using the promise ports of the A7V133 is
the only correlation I see again and again...
