It's not specifically important for virtualization.  It's a Linux kernel
feature, and right now it doesn't work very well when kvm is enabled,
and that should be fixed.

CPU hotplug is used by suspend/resume (basically, suspend hot-unplugs
all cpus except one an then suspends the machine.  Resume hotplugs the
cpus back after restarting the devices).
