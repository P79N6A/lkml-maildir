I don't know exactly how to interpret the numbers you gave, but
they look like they might be a (HZ quantised) delay coming from
block layer plugging.
O_DIRECT bypasses caching, but not (all) buffering.
Not sure whether the block layer can handle an unplug_delay set
to 0, but that might be something to try (see block/ll_rw_blk.c).
