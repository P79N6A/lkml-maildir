As far as I can see, frames sent on an ethernet network using a
PF_PACKET are not seen by the originating host itself: for example I can
send an ARP request and get an answer from another host on the network,
but I can not get an answer from my own host.
Is there a way to turn such a loopback on?
I already had the suggestion to use a tun/tap device and copy all frames
to/from the real ethernet interface, but I would rather use a lighter
solution if there is one.
