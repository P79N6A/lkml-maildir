Only if the lowest level is encoded in a time linear manner. If you are
using NRZ, NRZI etc at the bottom level then you may still be out...

The other problem I see with this code is it is very tightly tied to ATM
cell sizes, not to solving the generic question of packetisation. I'm
not sure if that matters but for modern processors I'm also sceptical
that the clever computation is actually any faster than just doing the
maths, especially if something cache intensive is also running.
