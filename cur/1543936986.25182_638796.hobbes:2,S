i dont think a revert at this stage is a good idea and i'm not sure 
pushing it back into -mm would really expose more of these bugs. And 
these are real bugs in filesystems - bugs which we want to see fixed 
anyway. You are also tracking down those bugs very fast.
[ perhaps, if it's possible technically (and if it is clean enough), you
  might want to offer a runtime debug tunable that can be used to switch
  off the new aspects of your code. That would speed up testing, in case
  anyone suspects the new writeback code. ]
