This is true, but it forces a lot of logic from the kernel to be run in
userspace to figure out what is going on.  Looking at mainline today:
#define PG_reclaim              17      /* To be reclaimed asap */
...
#define PG_readahead            PG_reclaim /* Reminder to do async read-ahead */
All of a sudden, to figure out which flag it actually is, we need to
have all of the logic that the kernel does.  
Does this establish a fixed user<->kernel ABI that will keep us from
doing this in the future:
-#define PG_slab                  7      /* slab debug (Suparna wants this) */
+#define PG_slab                  14      /* slab debug (Suparna wants this) */
Or, even something like this:
-#define PageSlab(page)          test_bit(PG_slab, &(page)->flags)
+#define PageSlab(page)          (!PageLRU(page) && !PageHighmem(page))
If we actually had several (or even still one file) that exposed this
state, independent of the actual content of page->flags, I think we'd be
better off.  I think that's the difference between a fun, super-useful
debugging feature and one that can stay in mainline and have
applications stay using it (without breaking) for a long time.
The flags you listed are things that I would imagine will always exist,
logically.  But, we might not always have a specific page flag for pages
under writeback or in the buddy list for that matter.  PG_buddy isn't
that old.  Perhaps that would be better abstracted to something like
page_in_main_allocator().
