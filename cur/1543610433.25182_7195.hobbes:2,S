Subject: [bug] broken loopback fs in 2.4.15-ish kernels?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

just noticed that rpm -i kernel-2.4.9-13.i386.rpm does not work anymore
because a corrupted initrd gets created by mkinitrd. It smelled like
pagecache corruption so i did not experiment much. This was with
2.4.15-pre9. Once i booted back into a 2.4.13-based kernel and re-did the
rpm -i, the initrd was created correctly.
things are pretty recent:
 [root@mars root]# rpm -q mkinitrd
 mkinitrd-3.2.6-1
 [root@mars root]# rpm -q rpm
 rpm-4.0.3-1.03
anyone seeing anything similar?
