We already have zone reclaim that can take care of smaller units but why 
would we start writeback if only one zone is full of dirty pages and there
are lots of other zones (nodes) that are free?

The bigger the system the larger the problem because the ratio of dirty
pages is calculated is currently based on the percentage of dirty pages
in the system as a whole. The less percentage of a system a cpuset 
contains the less effective the dirty_ratio and background_dirty_ratio 
become.

I can separate that one out.
