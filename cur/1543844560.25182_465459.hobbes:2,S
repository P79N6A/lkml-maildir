I suspect "extensively" may be a little bit of an overstatement, though
it sure would take some doing.  With some work, it may be possible to
write an alternative implementation of bind() that creates a Unix domain
socket, forks, execs a copy of the setuid-root program, recieves a copy
of the newly opened fd passed over the Unix domain socket, and returns
that to the caller of bind().  In this way, it might be possible to
build a solution that requires only minimal modifications to the app
(just change how it is linked).  It'd be messy and thoroughly unportable
(because it would only work on systems where that setuid program was
installed), but maybe doable.

Ok.  Understandable.  I leave it to others to comment further.  I'm not
advocating anything either way.
