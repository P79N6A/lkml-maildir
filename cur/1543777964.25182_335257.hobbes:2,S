Hi,
I need to explain background information more. My descriptions tends
to be depend on some knowledge about current xvfat for 2.4 kernel.
I'm not a author of xvfat fo 2.4 kernel, but can explain little more.
Current xvfat for 2.4 is designed to some specific flash memory card
controller which can guarantee atomicity of operation on ERASE-BLOCK size
unit. Xvfat for 2.4 try to merge operations on same ERASE-BLOCK under
some ordering constrain.
And xvfat for 2.4 uses own version of transaction control using 
in-core memory, not storage device like HDD nor flash ram,
to accomplish the above goal, with minimal changes on existing
FAT implementation. And this transaction control let FAT operations
came from different threads to fee from mixed up, where potentially
operation ordering problems would be caused.
We'll start with HDD, however later we'll cover memory devices.
For memory devices we may prepare another elevator functions,
depending on property of devices or lower layer. E.g. NAND/AND 
flash have  different operation units for read/write and erase,
and have some translation layer.

I agree. Even not removable media, this situation will be occurred.
Suppose that device like audio player which acts as USB client and provide
USB Mass class target class. Embedded storage may be handled through by
USB Host side, like Win PC or Mac.

As other messages said, some developers suggest "SoftUpdate" to be used.
I need to consider about situation where memory devices are used, not HDD.
