Where "multi-drive" == open-drain.  You're saying it should also be
used on SDA too ... OK, I was focussing on clock stretching but it
applies there too.

I see your point -- it does answer my question -- but you seem to have
overlooked a highly relevant one of mine.  :)
Regardless, those nuances should be captured in comments in that
driver:  that for GPIOs that don't support open drain output (only
push/pull drivers), that it's faked by otherwise-unnecessary
tweaking of GPIO direction.
