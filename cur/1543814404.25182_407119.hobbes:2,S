Hi everybody,
I want to compile the last stable version of the Linux Kernel
(2.6.15.6) but i want to add my own module in the kernel.
Firstly, is it a good idea to do this? Or it's more simple to add this
module after the compilation and add it to the modules which are
automicaly laoded?
But, if i want to add this module in the kernel source, what do i have
to do for this operation?
Thank you.
PS : sorry for my not fluent english.
