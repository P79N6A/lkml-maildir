What do you do when a charset doesn't contain a char that another one
does?
Compare the two very similar charsets ISO-8859-1 and ISO-8859-15 and
have the Euro-sign using ISO-8859-15. Then try to make that into
something sane.
Not knocking you or anything, you just have to think about these
pitfalls.
