Purpose of this patch is of course not to fill in the datablocks with zeroes.
The purpose (as applied to reiserfs) is to fill indirect data pointers (that is - pointers to real data blocks)
with zeroes (and to organize proper in-tree data structure for such pointers).
As of now such organization and zero-filling is done on a lazy manner at disk-flushing time.
Unfortunatelly this leads to races in the code.
I do not know why parts of this code can be needed by other filesystem and why Al Viro put it in generic VFS
code. (but he can comment on it, I think)
Bye,
