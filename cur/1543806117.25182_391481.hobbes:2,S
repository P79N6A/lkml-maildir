Yes.

No, not really (it's not different).  The pages are mapped, and brought
in via page faults.  There is read-ahead code, so if you start hitting
sequential pages, it'll read more than is immediately necessary in the
hope of keeping up.

Well, the easy way to disable on-demand loading is munmap().
Then the data won't be loaded and you'll get SIGSEGV.
However, I don't think that's what you mean.
If you want to keep code in memory, so it can't suffer a page
fault, either on initial load or by being swapped out to make
room for something else, use mlock() or mlockall().
If you just want to encourage (but not *insist*) code to be in memory,
I think Linux implements madvise(MADV_WILLNEED) sensibly.
