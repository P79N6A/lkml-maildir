first: Thanks for clearing this up for me. 
So, there are in fact some more "states" a swap-page can be in:
	-(0) free
	-(1) allocated, not in mem. 
	-(2) on swap, valid copy of memory. 
	-(3) on swap: invalid copy, allocated for fragmentation, can 
		be freed on demand if we are close to running out of swap.
If we running low on (0) swap-pages we can first start to reap the (3)
pages, and if that runs out, we can start reaping the (2)
pages. Right?
