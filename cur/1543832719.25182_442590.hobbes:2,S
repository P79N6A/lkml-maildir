Maybe - what if userspace is looking up /dev/tty0 in /proc/tty/drivers
and happens to know that it's called /dev/vc/0, because it's working
around this known idiosyncrasy of the kernel ?  If you change tty/drivers
to be the more correct /dev/tty0, such a program would needlessly break.

How can you be certain - I think that's Alan's point (if it isn't,
that's my point.)  The answer is you can't, so in order to maintain
ABI compatibility (and yes, this *IS* part of the kernel ABI) it
must be left exactly as-is.

That "terminally broken stuff" might just happen to work with today's
kernels.  Even so, that's no reason to pile in additional user-visible
changes which could potentially have adverse effects.
