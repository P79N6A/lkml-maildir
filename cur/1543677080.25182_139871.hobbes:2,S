I'm using 3.2. But I don't think it's a compiler issue:

There is a file missing: sound/version.h
I have fetched the file from ALSA CVS. It says
- ------------------------------------------------------------
/* include/version.h.  Generated by configure.  */
#define CONFIG_SND_VERSION "0.9.4"
#define CONFIG_SND_DATE ""
- ------------------------------------------------------------
The comment states, this file is generated by configure. Does that mean
"make (x|menu|old)config"? I doubt it because there was no such file.
I have built my source tree that way. Maybe that matters:
tar xvfj linux-2.4.20.tar.bz2
cd linux-2.4.20
bzcat ../patch-2.4.21-rc6.bz2 | patch -p1
bzcat ../2.4.21-rc6-dis3-final.diff.bz2 | patch -p1
Have I missed an extra ALSA configuration step?
Anyway, with the file from ALSA CVS it compiles without errors.
