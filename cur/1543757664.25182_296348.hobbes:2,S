Thats what I was afraid of, which makes using it for a motion detected 
burgular alarm source considerably less than practical since the 
machine must be able to do other things too.  Darn.  And its usb1.1 
even when plugged into a 2.0 capable port.
One could probably use the FIR output of an EagleEye (X10 stuff) to 
start & stop a capture, but the lag inherent in that is less than 
'optimum' IMO.
Thank you Oliver.
