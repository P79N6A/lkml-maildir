  For what it's worth, there's an awful lot of spam that makes it past
vger's filters to me that also then goes on to not get caught by my
(very well trained) bogofilter.  In other words, I'm not sure how much
this would add.
  Of course if it's instead of some of the current vger filtering it
will almost certainly be worthwhile.
