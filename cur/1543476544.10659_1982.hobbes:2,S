Yep.  I had this working for swap a long time ago via a separate kswiod
thread for swap IO, but it didn't make a lot of difference at the time
(we weren't swapping very intelligently in those days, though).  It's
something I have thought of resurrecting, mainly because I'm nervous
that if kswapd spends too much time swapping asynchronously then we can
be left starved of real free pages on the free lists for interrupts.
