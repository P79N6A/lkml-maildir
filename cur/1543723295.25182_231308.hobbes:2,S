On x86 and x86-64 with NX, is a fault due to non-exec permission
distinguishable from a fault due to lack of read/write permissions?
I.e. does the flags word have a different bit set?
If so, the solution is simple: don't just return if it's a non-exec fault.
(It's possible that won't work if the CPU is very speculative and
generates data faults from prefetches despite them being in non-exec
area -- i.e. if the buggy data fault gets precedence over the non-exec
fault or segment.  But I'd hope that's not the case).
