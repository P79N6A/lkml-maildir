So now it takes two users to gang up and do the same thing.  We should
either exempt root from the global check or simply remove the global limit
altogether.
Is it possible for a process to do setuid() with outstanding signals?  If
so, they may end up with a negative current->user->signal_pending?
You need to initialise ->signal_pending in alloc_uid().
What are you doing for testing of this?
Thanks.
