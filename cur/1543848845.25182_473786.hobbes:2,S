In my humble opinion, you should first write a 'real application', to show how 
the mmap buffer and kevent syscalls would be used (fast path and 
slow/recovery paths). I am sure it would be easier for everybody to agree on 
the API *before* you start coding a *lot* of hard (kernel) stuff : It would 
certainly save your mental CPU cycles (and ours too :) )
This 'real application' could be  the event loop of a simple HTTP server, or a 
basic 'echo all' server. Adding the bits about timers events and signals 
should be done too.
