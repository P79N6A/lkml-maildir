Hmm.  I didn't propose.  Sounds cool.  But that would have to happen
at the compiler's loader level, not the dynamic linker side of things,
which makes it less likely.  Someone once proposed a mega-library where
the big/key shared objects were linked together which would make this
somewhat more practical.
But even wasting a bit of space for a few key libraries, even if they
are smaller than 4 MB (or 2 MB) on ia32 (ia32 PAE) might be worth a
bit of TLB & general overhead (e.g. like the kernel text pages).  And,
if shared, even a bigger win.

Yep - that would be ideal - like the old sticky flag on binaries.
As a patch, that would make it easy to compare performance diffs as
well.  Probably good for things like Oracle or DB2 as well.
