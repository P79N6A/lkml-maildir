well, the most important thing would be to fix qemu to:
 - not use a 1024 /dev/rtc stream of signals as its clock emulation 
   source
i hacked that out of qemu, only to find out that qemu then uses periodic 
itimers. Instead of that it should use one-shot itimers, driven by the 
expiry time of the next clock. I.e. this code in vl.c, in 
host_alarm_handler():
    if (qemu_timer_expired(active_timers[QEMU_TIMER_VIRTUAL],
                           qemu_get_clock(vm_clock)) ||
        qemu_timer_expired(active_timers[QEMU_TIMER_REALTIME],
                           qemu_get_clock(rt_clock))) {
should start an itimer with an expiry time of:
 active_timers[QEMU_TIMER_VIRTUAL]->expire_time - qemu_get_clock(vm_clock)
or:
 active_timers[QEMU_TIMER_REALTIME]->expire_time - qemu_get_clock(rt_clock)
whichever is smaller. Furthermore, whenever timer->expire_time is 
changed in qemu_mod_timer(), this set-the-next-itimer-expiry-time code 
needs to be called. Would anyone like to try that?
this will reduce the host Qemu wakeup rate from 1000-1100/sec to the 
guest's 4-5/sec wakeup rate - resulting in 0.01% CPU overhead from a 
single idle guest. Current unmodified Qemu causes 10-20% CPU overhead 
from a single idle guest.
