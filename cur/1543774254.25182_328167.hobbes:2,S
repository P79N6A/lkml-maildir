1) Your email client mangled the TAB characters and spacing
   in the patch.
2) Networking patches should be sent to netdev@vger.kernel.org
   and usually with the maintainer of the code you're touching
   CC:'d.  In this case it would be (from linux/MAINTAINERS):
	BONDING DRIVER
	P:   Chad Tindel
	M:   ctindel@users.sourceforge.net
	P:   Jay Vosburgh
	M:   fubar@us.ibm.com
	L:   bonding-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
	W:   
http://sourceforge.net/projects/bonding/
	S:   Supported
Thanks.
