i disagree, you make it sound like it takes weeks of effort to find out
which stuff works on linux, and that basically you have to be lucky to
find it at all...
basically the only thing that doesent work (i dont count binary-only
solutions working) is nvidia and ati.
other mainstream stuff just works.. i never have to look for hardware
when i buy, it simply works (whereas the few times i have put together a
system that should run windows hardware has often not worked very well..
if at all)
i have also converted a fair share of windows users to linux, where they
have simply gone to the store and bought their pc, and it has never
given problems (granted, there i have installed nvidia driver even
though its closed source stuff.)
as it is today, the end user doesent really have much of a problem.

i agree, stupid vendors which ignores linux drivers should be pointed
out, and vendors which either give specs, develop drivers or help doing
so should also be pointed out.
