i dont really like the static splitup of 'normal' vs. 'HRT' timers -
there might in fact be separate priority requirements between HRT timers
too.
i think one possible solution would be to introduce some notion of
'timer priority', and to expire each timer priority level in a separate
timer expiry thread. Priority 0 (lowest) would be expired in ksoftirqd,
and there would be 3 separate threads for say priorities 1-3. Or
something like this. Potentially exposed to user-space as well, via new
APIs. Hm?
To push this even further: in theory timers could inherit the priority
of the task that starts them, and they would be expired in that priority
order - but this probably needs a pretty clever (and most likely
complex) data-structure ...
