You are quite right.  Compilations should be SILENT.  How else do you
know nothing's wrong?  I would rewrite (refactor?) the code above as:
  if( something1 )
  {
    if( something2 ) { do_2(); }
  }
  else
  {
    do_not_1();
  }
and yes I use two spaces, not tabs, to indent, so I don't fall off the
page; and yes, I always use the braces, even in a one-liner; and yes,
I put the braces there and not like K&R, so I can see the buggers.
Also I NULL all my pointers immediately after declaring them AND after
using them, and I check they're not NULL before using them, which
prevents loads of segfault type errors when I screw up and...
But in trying to change the world, you're wasting time (and bandwidth :).
73,
Ged.
