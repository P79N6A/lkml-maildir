If it's a real problem, yes I agree. If it's just hand waving, then no.
The fact that 2.4 and 2.6 has been using 256 for ages really tells me
that no one has been affected by this. The SUSE bugzilla certainly
hasn't seen any entries on it either.

Heh, good question. Given that the limit is so high, we might as well
just use 65535. It's not nearly as sensitive as the lba28 case.
