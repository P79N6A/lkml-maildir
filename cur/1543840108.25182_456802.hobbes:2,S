Using the top-level cpuset itself is something that I don't think the
patches support yet. Shouldnt be hard to make it work, except usage of
tasks in the top-level cpuset need to be accounted/controlled. I am working on 
this now and as well some changes wrt timeslice management. Will send out some
patches soon!
