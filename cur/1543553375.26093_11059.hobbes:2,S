A grand example I should have included. Thanx! Last I knew the status
was that SGI had built the kernel with thier compiler, by adding gcc
syntax into it, but had not reached the point where the kernel would
run. Perhaps they have gotten past this. Since I'm no longer involved in
the Trillian (read ia64 Linux Project) mailing lists or weekly phone
calls I have been out of this loop for a month or so.
