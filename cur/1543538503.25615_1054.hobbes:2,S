The problem is that this behavior is also evident on unmounted partitions,
and it can bite unsuspecting people working with such raw devices for
legitimate purposes, such as setting them up.
If /dev/hda1 isn't to be accessed from /dev/hda, maybe the kernel should
enforce that, or this should be clearly documented somewhere (which is hard).
Otherwise, the cache isn't coherent, which is not fun.
To reproduce (with 2.2.14) -
/dev/hda is a completely idle, unmounted and unaccessed IDE device on my
system, with a single primary partition spanning the entire disk.
  dd if=/dev/hda1 skip=100 bs=512 count=1 of=hda1.sector.original
  dd if=/dev/hda  skip=163 bs=512 count=1 of=hda.sector.original
  dd if=junk.sector of=/dev/hda1 conv=notrunc seek=100 bs=512 count=1
  dd if=/dev/hda1 skip=100 bs=512 count=1 of=hda1.sector
  dd if=/dev/hda  skip=163 bs=512 count=1 of=hda.sector
hda1.sector and hda.sector wouldn't be equal, at this point.
After clearing the cache ('dd if=/dev/hdb of=/dev/null ...') and rereading
the sectors, the two would be identical.
(Obviously, I'm assuming my personal disk geometry here. As presented above,
data-loss would occur. Don't try this at home!).
