It's intentional. The current CONFIG_IDE_MAX_HWIFS is a hidden
variable that sets a per architecture maximum. To the best of my
knowledge, there's no way to do, say:
   default 4 if ARCH_FOO
   default 1 if ARCH_BAR
..so I'm stuck with using two config symbols anyway.
I've thought about it, this is the best I could come up with. If you
can come up with something cleaner, I'm all ears.
