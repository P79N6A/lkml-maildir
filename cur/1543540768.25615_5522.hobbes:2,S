I agree that this approach is cleaner / better... No doubt about that.
The patch I made had the goal to be as minimal as possible....

If Linus keeps rejecting it, I hope the "not optimal but simple" patch I
made can be accepted, as it at least fixes the problem (with a bandaid);
2.5 should have the /drivers/input stuff.
If it were up to me, 2.4 should as well, but that is Linus' call.
