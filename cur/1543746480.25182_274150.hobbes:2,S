Hi everyone.
I know that I still have work to do on suspend2, but thought it was high
time I got around to properly submitting the code for review, so here
goes.
I have it split up into 51 patches, of which most are less than 20k,
although there are three 50k patches. Changes to the rest of the kernel
tree come first, then the core. The full tree can be found at
http://suspend2.bkbits.net:8080/merge-tree
Regards,
Nigel
