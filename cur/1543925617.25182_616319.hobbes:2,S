I got a bug in this patch. In kprobes_64.c, Since this added __kprobes
to kretprobe_trampoline_holder(), the arch_init_kprobes() failed to
insert a kprobe into that function, and the initialization was failed.
This means that kprobe_exceptions_notify() was not registered to
die_notifier_chain. So, it caused a kernel crash.

On i386, I introduced kretprobe-booster, which did not need to insert
a kprobe. Thus, I also added __kprobes to kretprobe_trampoline_holder()
on i386.
I think we can remove __kprobes from kretprobe_trampoline_holder()
in kprobes_32.c if you'd like to make the both same. However, it
is not safe. So we need a comment on top explaining why it does not
have that annotation and users must take care of it.
By the way, I'm porting boosters to x86-64 (and ia64). Since some parts
of that will be covered by this patch, I'd like to know your unification
plan.
Best regards,
