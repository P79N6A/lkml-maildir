Then if disabling that code which enables the SMI doesn't work,
you have only one real option other than telling your BIOS not
to support USB keyboards/mice/disks:  replace your BIOS.
The reason it prints the BIOS handoff message is because you
completely disabled the handoff, so your BIOS still thinks it
owns that controller.  Commenting out that line is not good.
