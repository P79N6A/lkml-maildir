Because the one in the namesys tree is almost unreadable.  It is
intermixed with 16 other changes (in a single changeset) then modified
by incremental fixes and merge sets.  The bug fix is complex enough as
it is, the namesys version is very difficult to verify.
Please let Oleg and I work out an actual coherent group of changesets
instead of this mess.
