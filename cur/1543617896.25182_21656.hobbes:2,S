actually works.
"Even Better(tm)" would be if
ln /proc/<id>/fd/<nr> whatever
or
ln <Inode> whatever (lsof delivers the needed Inode-nr)
would work.
Otherwise you have a problem to recover files when you have insufficent
disc space. Imagine a file that is 1GB in size and you have 512MB left
on the hdd. Currently i don't see a chance to recover such a file
without problems.
