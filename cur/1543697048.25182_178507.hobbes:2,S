Hi all...
Anybody has any idea about why this fails:
    fd = open("/lib/libnss_files.so.2", O_RDONLY);
    res = read(fd,buf,512);
/lib is NFS mounted:
192.168.0.1:/lib on /lib type nfs (ro,noatime,nfsvers=3,nolock,addr=192.168.0.1)
and the read fails.
The original code does a getprotobyname("tcp") (netpipe), that fails when it
tries to read the same lib.
The node boots via PXE, with a version of libnss_files.so.2 on the /lib present
in the initrd, which is replaced by the mounted one.
TIA
