At least that suggests it's not fallout from the INTC changes in -rc1, so
that helps to narrow it down a bit. Since you have a known good and bad,
it would be nice if you could bisect this to figure out what exactly
caused the regression. There weren't any SH-specific changes between rc6
and rc8/rc9 at least.
