yes. And for thread groups this can only happen for the thread group
leader if all 'child' threads have exited. So it can never happen that we
somehow get to a 'middle' thread, walk the chain and get to a task that is
invalid. The only possibility is that the starting point is stale itself -
and the pid_alive() test checks that.
the thread group leader being 'zombie' does not mean it's unhashed. Thread
group leaders are never detached threads, they have a parent that waits
for them. So these zombies just hang around until the last thread goes
away, and then the leader is released, unhashed from the PID space (and
thus next_thread() stops being valid) and the parent is notified.
