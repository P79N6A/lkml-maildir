Agreed moving the compat_ioctl to mtdchar now that it is possible
sounds good.
I can see that argument with respect to mtdblock.  But why would
removal of mtdchar be a good thing?  It is a simple raw access
interface.   For those whose flash parts are too small for a filesystem
or when you are doing things that you can't do with a filesystem
like making or checking it you need something like mtd char.  For
embedded folks who don't care you can just compile it out.
