So here they are. This machine is a P4 2.80C@3.366GHz, HT enabled on a
Asus P4P800 mobo, Intel 82801EB onboard sound device (snd-intel8x0).
                                   2.6.9smp   RT-V0.6.9smp
                                 ------------ ------------
 XRUN Rate   . . . . . . . . . :       0            0      /hour

 Average Context-Switch Rate . :   10082        15793      /sec
As you can see, the results here aren't so disparate as on my UP laptop.
I guess that I can stress this out and lower the period size on jackd -R,
to -p64. And even increase the workload with more client instances (from 9
to 18 ?) to let the RT show it's potential, if that makes sense at all.
Bye now.
