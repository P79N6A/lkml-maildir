As you mention md_compatible.h does not exist, it was introduced in 2.5.2
patch only in drivers/md/xor.c. But in at least pre5 all structures were
correctly defined in various md_{p,u,k}.h files. I've tried to find others
undefined symbols, but cann't. So i suggest you to upgrade a bit to pre6
or pre5 kernel ;), apply my litle patch and remove mention of
md_compatible.h in drivers/md/xor.c. And feel free to write all others
erorrs, if they will appear again.
