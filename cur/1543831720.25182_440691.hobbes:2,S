it's way too much pain for little gain.

that seems quite unlikely to happen. I think you are missing the biggest 
issue: for RT, if the priority inheritance mechanism does not extend to 
a given scheduling pattern it causes longer latencies, but no harm is 
done otherwise. But for SCHED_BGND we'd have to make sure _every_ place 
is priority-inversions safe - otherwise we risk a potential local DoS if 
a task with a critical resource is backgrounded! That's plain impossible 
to achieve.
