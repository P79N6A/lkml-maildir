Subject: 2.6.0-test1 ACPI minor? proc problems.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

While beating on 2.6.0-test1, the only issue I've seen so far is:
cd /proc/
while true
do
find [^0-9k]* -exec wc \{} \; &
sleep 1
done
Causes some ACPI proc errors to be logged in syslog.
(bogus dates)

Hmm, maybe it's not so trivial, when I went to copy the .config over from the
affected machine onto this one, to post, nfs locked up. (may of course
be unrelated)
If the .config / /proc/acpi/* is needed, then I'll send that on request.
