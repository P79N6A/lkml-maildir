I haven't had a chance to look at this yet, never mind try it out, but
there's one thing I'd be interested in knowing: How does it handle
dual-mode CD's (those with a combination of data and audio tracks) ???
I'd like to see it handle those by one of the following, but have no
idea if either is possible:
 1. "mount /dev/cdrom" results in a separate directory called /audio
    appearing with the relevant files within it.
 2. "mount /dev/cdrom" can be used twice, once each with iso9660 and
    audiofs as the mount type, with different mount points.
Comments?
Best wishes from Riley.
