  Pretty much every charset other than Unicode does not NEED encoding
because it was already designed to work with existing system. The decision
to make the basic representation of charset full of zero bytes was the
reason that created the need for UTF-8. People who use other charsets may
not have planned for multilingual environments like they should've done,
but they aren't stupid enough to require someone to "bless" them with a
variable-length encoding.
