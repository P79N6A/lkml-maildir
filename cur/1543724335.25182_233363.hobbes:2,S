we are dealing here with about half a cycle or so overhead. (an extra
jump back to the 'likely' section) Often the BTB can even totally
eliminate the overhead. Worst-case we've got a slightly larger icache
footprint. But all in one it's not really an issue, and if you compile
for embedded it wont be done by the compiler anyway.
