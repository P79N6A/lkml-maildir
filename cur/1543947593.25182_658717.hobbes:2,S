Hm, maybe my fault and I don't know the english language enough, but these
do not count as personal insults here where I live in Germany. Especially
the second one is in no way an insult here. It merely tells you that the
number of people having this issue is very low.
I'm sorry if that sounded like insults. That wasn't my intention.
