I wanted to change the ownership on a unix domain socket in a program (running 
as root) I was writing and I was wondering if "fchown" worked on the socket 
descriptor (after I'd run "bind" of course).
It doesn't, you have to use "chown" on the path name - however "fchown" 
silently does nothing, it doesn't report an error.
I don't mind it not working but I think it should report an error. This is on 
2.6.3 kernel.
I tried it on HP/UX 11 and it gave EINVAL (which the HP manual page doesn't 
document) and on Solaris 9 which likewise silently did nothing.
