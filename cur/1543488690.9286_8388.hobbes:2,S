The out_of_order_queue check is bogus because the fast path should be never
entered when there are ooo packets. Also you just introduced a costly
additional function call with useless checking (sk!=NULL etc.) to an
important fast path. Why should we go through all the hazzles of header
prediction, if all benefits are later destroyed by lazy coding like this?
I also don't see what you're trying to archieve with this change.
