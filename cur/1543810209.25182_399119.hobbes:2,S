[SCSI command timeout in sbp2 after resume; no nodemgr updates after resume]

AFAICT the reason is that the host adapter drivers (1394 low-level 
drivers) ohci1394 and pcilynx lack proper .suspend and .resume hooks. 
Such functionality seems only be present for Powermacs with Uninorth 
chipset.
OHCI 1.1 table A-11 says (surprise!) that host adapters loose PCI 
configuration and 1394 configuration when going into D3 state. We don't 
backup and restore it yet. I could perhaps look into it in late spring 
or summer.
