ISTR looking at this in some detail a few years back, and
concluding that it wouldn't quite work.  That was before
started to hear back from people that the pxa27x hardware
didn't really match its documentation, too ...

That would involve *multiple* such fake calls.  Not the most
elegant of solutions, but ISTR using it in some other context.
But again, that presumes sane hardware, or at least hardware
that matches the docs.  And people who've looked at this in
more pain than I have are consistent in telling me that pxa27x
endpoint configuration has problems that the docs and errata
do not describe.  (If it were just one person, rather than four
different developers, I'd be somewhat skeptical.)  Hence my
eventual conclusion (and advice) to just stop trying to use
that misfeature.

Has someone actually signed up to develop and maintain such a
controller driver?  If so, that would be a Fine Thing, but not
one I've heard rumored before.  I've assumed that the best we'd
have is someone (Rodolfo?!) finally cleaning up a pxa27x version
so it could be merged.
