So, in this scenario (where trampoline code is mapped by non global
page), we will not hit this issue.

This is not a recommended solution.

Our analysis has shown that this is E80 issue.  In this 4G-4G kernel
context, we are safe to use non-global mapping as a workaround for this
issue. (Or we can use any of the other recommendations given in the spec
update except rdtsc with global pages).
We have also seen that inserting rdtsc instruction is not a workaround.
We will update the spec update with this information.
On a little different note, while running the 4G-4G kernel on our
machine, we saw occasional hangs.  Those are root caused to the fact
that this kernel was first chaging the stack pointer from virtual stack
to kernel and then changing the CR3 to that of kernel.  Any interrupt
between these two instructions will result in those hangs as the
interruption handler will execute with user's CR3(as the kernel thinks
that it is already in kernel because of the value of esp).  Swapping the
order, first loading the CR3 with kernel and then switching the stack to
kernel fixes this issue.  Venki will generate that patch and send to
lkml.
Thanks, rohit
