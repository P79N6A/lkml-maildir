I have a T41p with: Multimedia audio controller: Intel Corp.
82801DB/DBL/DBM (ICH4/ICH4-L/ICH4-M) AC'97 Audio Controller (rev 01),
which looks to the be the same as Ulisses' device.
It works fine for me in 2.6.11-rc4 (has worked fine for a while, as
well). I have both a "Headphone Jack Sense" and "Line Jack Sense"
(both set to off) mixer entry in alsamixer. I'm not sure why you're
not seeing these entries...
Thanks,
Nish
