Well,
	If any one has an alpha system availble, Iprobe has been ported to 
FreeBSD and Alpha/Linux.  They would be able to do a more indepth analysis than
the following:
+---------------------------------+

    * One sample = 65536 events *
Begin            End                                    Sample Image Total

FFFFFC0000300000-00000000FFFFFFFF vmlinux                 2232         6.0
FFFFFC0000315E40-FFFFFC0000315F7F   do_entInt              768  34.4   2.1
(I asked Iprobe to only show me functions where >1% of the time was being
spent)
We can see that time is not being spent in any libraries.
We can get a breakdown by PC, but that isn't particularly useful unless
someone really wants to take time to look at it. 
Iprobe should only add a small amount of noise to the system.  (5%)
