That's true for some, but not others.  For example, I'd say that
things like getreg() and setreg() are pretty intuitive.

Assembly output != GCC asm statements.  There are lots of
assembly-savy folks that have no clue how to read/interpret the GCC
asm syntax.  Those folks have the option of either generating an
assembly file or disassembling the resulting object file.  Both
approaches would let them read the resulting code without having to
know exactly how the asm statement (or intrinsic) works.

Agreed.
