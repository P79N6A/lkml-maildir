There was a design choice at swap_cgroup.
At rmdir, there may be used swap entry in memcg. (mem->memsw.usage can be > 0)
  1. update all records in swap cgroup
  2. just ignore account from swap, we can treat then at swap-in.
I implemented "2" by refcnt.
To do "1", we have to scan all used swap_cgroup but I don't want to scan all
swap_cgroup entry at rmdir. It's heavy job.
(*) To reduce memory usage by swap_cgroup, swap_cgroup just have a pointer to memcg
(**) I implemented swap_cgroup as statically allocated array because I don't want
    any dynamic memory allocation at swap-out and want to avoid unnecessary memory
    usage.
