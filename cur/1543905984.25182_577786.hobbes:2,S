I also have the same error, which I didn't have in 2.6.22:
FATAL: drivers/acpi/ac: sizeof(struct acpi_device_id)=20 is not a
modulo of the size of section __mod_acpi_device_table=48.
Fix definition of struct acpi_device_id in mod_devicetable.h
make[1]: *** [__modpost] Error 1
Build system is x86_64. I'm not cross-compiling, as the target machine
(not the build machine) is also x86_64.
