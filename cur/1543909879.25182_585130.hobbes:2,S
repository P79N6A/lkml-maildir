"b = (volatile int)a;" doesn't help us because a cast to a qualified type
has the same effect as a cast to an unqualified version of that type, as
mentioned in 6.5.4:4 (footnote 86) of the standard. Note that "volatile"
is a type-qualifier, not a type itself, so a cast of the _object_ itself
to a qualified-type i.e. (volatile int) would not make the access itself
volatile-qualified.
To serve our purposes, it is necessary for us to take the address of this
(non-volatile) object, cast the resulting _pointer_ to the corresponding
volatile-qualified pointer-type, and then dereference it. This makes that
particular _access_ be volatile-qualified, without the object itself being
such. Also note that the (dereferenced) result is also a valid lvalue and
hence can be used in "*(volatile int *)&a = b;" kind of construction
(which we use for the atomic_set case).
