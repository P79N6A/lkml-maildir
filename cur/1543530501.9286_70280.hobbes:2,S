Just my $0.02:
Donald, you have created a lot of drivers which I use on a daily
basis. And I am grateful for that.
The only thing is, I neer saw you on linux-kernel. People talked
a lot on linux-kernel and the eepro100 lists about transmit
timeouts etc - yet never a word from you.
So, now that I am finally seeing you on linux-kernel, I really
hope it stays this way. Please - keep subscribed to this list,
work with Linus and the rest on the current kernel. I really
think your insights are valuable. Don't unsubsribe.
Thanks
Mike.
