Andi, if people are trying to find an optimal tuning then in many cases 
a reboot is out. There are two reasons for this:
- a production server, can't just reboot!
- it's sometimes hard to recreate the load which is causing problems,
   and far easier to get a working config by diddling and watching.
At least those are the reasons why I would feel able to tune the 
machines which most need it.
