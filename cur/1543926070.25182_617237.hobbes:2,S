1) Please send separate patches for separate problems.
2) Your patch is white space damaged and does not apply. Please run it
   through scripts/checkpatch.pl before submitting, maybe send it to
   yourself first and verify that it applies correctly.

Good catch.

Also put the detailed description into the patch comment, please.

Care to resend ?
