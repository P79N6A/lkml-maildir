I used to have an Amiga (well I still have it actually, my brother still
plays my old games on it). What I wonder about is what hardware the new
Amiga's will have. My 500 had a 7.xx Mhz Motorola 68000 but it still wiped
the floor with a PC. It did (kind of) multitasking and was 32-bit. But
what made the computer by itself so great was the extra chips the thing
had. The special DMA, Video, Sound, ... chips did a lot of neat stuff.
E.g. chip-RAM was shared between CPU and that big DMA-chip (can't remember
his name :) ) makeing it so that a lot of stuff could be handled without
the CPU haveing to come into the picture.
So I think I'd like to know what hardware they'll use before I'd start
makeing a fuss. If I gave you a DSP that did mp3-decoding (costs near to
nothing BTW) your CPU would need to do nearly nothing to play an mp3 (a
286 would be enough). For many other things this goes too. It shouldn't be
too hard to put in some DSP's that do some neat tricks and make everything
a lot easier to handle. AFAIK short latency is interesting because you
want to make small blocks of data so you have instant changes in your
output. But if you'd move a big part of that functionality to a DSP you'd
have a lot less worries.
Another thing for your tests:
- I know you've tested more recent kernels but did you remember to remove
update in your rc-scripts? You should check in pstree wether you only see
kflushd or both kflushd and update. update shouldn't be there as update
works somewhat differently than kflushd and will disturb eachother because
they are both there for te same task: getting buffered data to disk.
