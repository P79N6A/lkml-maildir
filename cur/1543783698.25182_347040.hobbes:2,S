Calls to external functions whose address is not known at compile time
look like this (using 'objdump -d' on my 2.6.10 kernel:)
    19fd:       e8 fc ff ff ff          call   19fe <filp_close+0x4e>
e8 is call relative with 32-bit displacement from start of next instruction.
The displacement points right back at itself (fffffffc == -4)

eax is f88ad500 and your illegal access was at f88ad52c
Looks like filp->fops points to unallocated memory and it dies while
trying to access filp->fops->flush here:
        if (filp->f_op && filp->f_op->flush) {
