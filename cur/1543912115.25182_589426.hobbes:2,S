Subject: [35/36] Large blocksize support for ext2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This adds support for a block size of up to 64k on any platform.
It enables the mounting filesystems that have a larger blocksize
than the page size.
F.e. the following is possible on x86_64 and i386 that have only a 4k page
size:
mke2fs -b 16384 /dev/hdd2	<Ignore warning about too large block size>
mount /dev/hdd2 /media
ls -l /media
.... Do more things with the volume that uses a 16k page cache size on
a 4k page sized platform..
Hmmm... Actually there is nothing additional to be done after the earlier
cleanup of the macros. So just modify copyright.
