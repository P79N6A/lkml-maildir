I tried struct path; in terms of code size it doesn't seem worth it. We could 
get identical code out of it as if we were passing the dentry and vfsmount 
individually, with somewhat slimmer looking interfaces, but then we'd have to 
create temporary struct path objects in a few places, and accessing either 
object would become a bit more verbose (path.dentry instead of dentry, etc.)
See the following thread on linux-kernel, Message-ID 
200702031425.38054.agruen@suse.de:
  [RFC] Pack the vfsmount and dentry in nameidata into a struct path
Thanks,
Andreas
