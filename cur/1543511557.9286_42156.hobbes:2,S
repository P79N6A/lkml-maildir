   David, I respect your opinion, however you are mistaken about
   something and may have spoken too soon by accident.  If so, no
   biggie - we've all done so...
I stand corrected, and publicly apologize.
I was under the impression that the wrapper layer for their
kernel module was the only portion for which source was
distributed, and that the main portion of the kernel module
was binary-only.
Anyways, my apologies.
Later,
David S. Miller
