What queue depth is the AIC setting?
SCSI in 2.5.x no longer copies the request, so if you have a queue
depth larger than the allocated requests there might not be
any free requests left for the blk layer to play with.
AIC default queue depth is 253 (with 2.5.46 queue depth can be set to 1
if scsi is all in kernel, or no upper drivers are available when the 
host adapter is intialized), it should auto lock it to the right depth,
but right now it does not notify the upper layer of the queue depth
change (no call to scsi_adjust_queue_depth when locking in the new
queue depth). You can modify .config, or pass boot/module options to
lower it.
