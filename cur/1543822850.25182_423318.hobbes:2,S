Subject: [PATCH] Add dependency on kernel.release to the package targets
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Add dependency on kernel.release to the package targets
The binrpm-pkg target uses KERNELRELEASE when generated its .spec
file.  When binrpm-pkg was the first build target run in a tree it
generated the .spec before kernel.release so the Version: tag
in the .spec was empty.
I don't know if this is the best fix, but binrpm-pkg works when we
explicitly build kernel.release before descending into package-dir.
