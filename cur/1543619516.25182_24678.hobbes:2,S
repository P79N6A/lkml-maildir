Ah, I see. 
So, you're getting this error:
core.c:179: parse error before `device_init_root'
core.c:180: warning: return-type defaults to `int'
core.c:185: parse error before `device_driver_init'
core.c:186: warning: return-type defaults to `int'
If you add 
#include <linux/init.h>
does it compile?
