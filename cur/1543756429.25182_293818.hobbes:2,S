In fact, the patch is completely wrong for M1533 south bridge, it will 
work only with M1543.
M1533 has different PCI config. register layout - the bit 2 of 0x5F 
register is not used for enabling/disabling M7101 but for "on-chip 
arbiter control". M7101 can be enabled/disabled using bit 6 of 0x5D 
register... M1533 has also different M7101 registers.
The best thing about this is that these two M7101s have the same PCI 
device IDs (0x7101).
The south bridges have the same PCI IDs too (0x1533 used by both M1533 
and M1543). But according to the datasheet, M1543 should have revision 
number at least 0xC0.
