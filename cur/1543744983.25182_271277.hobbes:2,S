I understand your frustration. 
While there are a great number of systems that can use the TSC, cpufreq
scaling laptops, and a number of SMP and NUMA systems cannot use it as a
time source. Additinoally its difficult to detect when its wrong as
there are a reasonable number of systems that frequently miss timer
ticks. Although it is much slower, ACPI PM is just more reliable across
the broad spectrum of systems. 
With your patch, ACPI PM would never be selected (as TSC always wins
when available, and it will be available on all ACPI enabled i386
systems). So its just the same as disabling CONFIG_X86_PM_TIMER, so why
not just do that?
Do note, using the "clock=tsc" boot option, you can easily force the
system to use the TSC.

Well, the lost-ticks/pit fallback code isn't all that robust. We have
two unreliable time sources where we try to sort out which one is wrong
by using the other. I worry we'd have to implement something like NTP in
the kernel in order to correctly choose the best working time source.
I would however, support a patch that selected the TSC over the ACPI PM
time source when CONFIG_CPUFREQ and CONFIG_SMP were N. That's fairly
safe.
