ACK but do we really need to benchmark this if we *know* we are
creating unnecessary branches? How about Jeff's suggestion of
introducing pci_mmio_map() ? This way we leave the current
documenation as it is and just introduce this for MMIO-only devices.
No benchmarks are necessary then, and no need to confuse people with
the old API.
