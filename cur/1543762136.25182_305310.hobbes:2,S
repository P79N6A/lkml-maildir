Well, seek(fd, 0, SEEK_END) could be used to flush a pipe's buffers.
0>> +static loff_t kmsg_seek(struct file *filp, loff_t offset, int origin) {
0>> +    if(origin != 2 /* SEEK_END */ || offset < 0) { return -ESPIPE; }
3> "Allow" seeking past the end of the buffer?
Well, what does lseek(fd, >0, SEEK_END) do on normal files?
