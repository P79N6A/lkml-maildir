Subject: PATCH: Adjust PCI rom code to handle more broken ROMs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

There are ROMs reporting that their size exceeds their PCI ROM
resource window. This patch returns the minimum of the resource window
size or the size in the ROM.  An example of this breakage is the XGI
Volari Z7.

Patch is in an attachment since gmail will mangle the tabs.
