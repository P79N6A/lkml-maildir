Greetings;
Motherboard is a biostar with nforce2 chipset, 2800xp cpu, gig of ram.
I've recently made the observation that while I can view 30fps video 
from my firewire equipt movie camera with a minimal cpu hit of 2-3%, 
but viewing the video from a webcam on a usb 1.1 circuit takes 30-40% 
of the cpu, at half the frame rate.
Do I have something fubar in the usb?  Or is this just the nature of 
the beast?
