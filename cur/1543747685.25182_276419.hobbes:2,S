As Herbert points out, hpet_time_init() and time_init() and who knows what
else do:
	wall_to_monotonic.tv_sec = -xtime.tv_sec;
	xtime.tv_nsec = (INITIAL_JIFFIES % HZ) * (NSEC_PER_SEC / HZ);
	wall_to_monotonic.tv_nsec = -xtime.tv_nsec;
And this:
 * The current time 
 * wall_to_monotonic is what we need to add to xtime (or xtime corrected 
 * for sub jiffie times) to get to monotonic time.  Monotonic is pegged at zero
 * at zero at system boot time, so wall_to_monotonic will be negative,
 * however, we will ALWAYS keep the tv_nsec part positive so we can use
 * the usual normalization.
So I assume the bug is that time_init() is failing to normalise
wall_to_monotonic?
