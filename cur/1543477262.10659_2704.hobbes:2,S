Ow.
I applied the patch and rebooted.  wdm started.  mouse would not move.
Log in from another machine.  su.  killall wdm.  dpkg -r wdm.  (didn't
want it anyway).  Back to my machine, on tty1.  Hit Alt-F2, there's
garbage after the login prompt.  Hit backspace many times, Enter.  OOPS!
Alt-SysReq-B.  Wait for disk check.  
I don't think I like pre-7.  It seems like it's running right now, but I'm
guessing that it's not going to be very stable.  I didn't record the OOPS
info, sorry.  I will if it happens again and I can see it.
This didn't happen last time (when dpkg installed wdm).
regards,
Christopher (still not on the list).
