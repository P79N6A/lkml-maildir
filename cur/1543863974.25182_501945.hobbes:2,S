My apologies, I was unclear.
This check is racy, the condition could be changed right after the check.
It is unneeded, it is ok to do send_sigqueue(tsk) if if that task is already
dead. (we hold the reference to task_struct).
Now suppose that the main thread (->group_leader) already exited. This is
normal, the thread group is still alive, it should be ok to send a signal to
it via send_group_sigqueue(). But we can't: without SIGEV_THREAD_ID in
->sigev_notify good_event() returns ->group_leader, and it has PF_EXITING.
Yes, kernel/posix-timers.c needs a cleanup too. But please note that it does
this check for another reason (according to the comment). This reason is not
valid now, the callsite for exit_itimers() was moved from __exit_signal() to
do_exit().

I personally think it is better to export __sigqueue_free() even if sigqueue_free()
happens to work. It is to fragile imho to reference current->sighand. At least
we need a fat comment.

Hmm... now I don't understand you. Of course, the aio error path should use
__sigqueue_free() if we don't use SIGQUEUE_PREALLOC (and imho we should not).
And the signal delivery path uses __sigqueue_free() too.

Ok, I see, thanks.
