-mm consists of the sum of
a) the ~80 subsytem maintainers trees (git and quilt)
b) the ~100 subsytem trees which are hosted only in -mm.
linux-next consists of only a)
Soon I shall remove a) from -mm and will replace it with linux-next (this
should be a no-op).
Later, I shall start feeding those 100 random subsystems into linux-next
as well (somehow).

yes.  85% of the code which goes into Linux goes via the ~80 subsystem
maintainers' trees and is (or should be) in linux-next.  The other 15%
is the hosted-in-mm work.

No, please test the sum-of-all-trees in linux-next.  If you hit problems
then, as part of the problem resolving process a developer _might_ ask you
to test one tree specifically, but that would be a pretty unusual
circumstance.
