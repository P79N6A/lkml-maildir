I did that and got this in 'make modules':
   CC [M]  drivers/input/joydev.o
   CC [M]  drivers/input/evdev.o
drivers/input/evdev.c: In function 'evdev_do_ioctl':
drivers/input/evdev.c:749: error: 'struct input_dev' has no member named 
'event_lock'
drivers/input/evdev.c:757: error: 'struct input_dev' has no member named 
'event_lock'
make[2]: *** [drivers/input/evdev.o] Fehler 1
make[1]: *** [drivers/input] Fehler 2
make: *** [drivers] Fehler 2
The next piece of the puzzle:
No oops with 2.6.24-rc6 vanilla and the same kernel patched with 
TuxOnIce 3.0-rc3 for kernel 2.6.24-rc3. A minor nit was that I had to 
rebuild the xorg driver for the tablet to get it working.
