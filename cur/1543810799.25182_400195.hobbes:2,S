Yes, as they have no "bus" to attach too.  That's why they are there,
they are for devices with no bus, but are merely "raw" memory mapped
devices.

I guess I look at your FPGA as a PCI "bridge" chip, that bridges between
the PCI bus, and your "kumar" bus (for lack of a better name).  Your
devices hang off of that bus, which is attached to the FPGA, which is
attached to the pci bridge, and so on.  If you use the platform bus, you
break that link.
Does that make sense?
Russell probably has other thoughts about this.
