No, you can do this from within an LSM and the kernel hackers don't have to deal
with it....
(tech note - don't call register_sysctl_table() from within a security_initcall().
Use a separate __initcall() that gets called later - security_initcall() happens
before the kernel has the sysctl infrastructure in place.  Guess how I know that? ;)
