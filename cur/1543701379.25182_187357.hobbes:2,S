I like the direction of your patch:  the driver informs us ahead of time 
what it wants (even though this isn't necessarily true with PCI_DAC_EN, 
which falls back instead of fails).
However, the one big failing of your version is that the driver _must_ 
know if PCI DAC succeeded or not.  Therefore, two pieces of information 
must be returned (error value, DAC flag(s)), which lends itself more to 
leaving my version as-is ;-)

That was intentional in my patch, as it's a warning not an error in my 
pci_set_dac.  In your version I would agree.
