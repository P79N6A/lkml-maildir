Yeah OK. I don't want to turn this into an argument, but the difference
is AFAIK, that many of them are made *for* running Linux (or at least as
a supported configuration). While the xbox requires you to circumvent
the hardware.
But on the other hand, "why not?" :)
As I said, so long as Linus or Andrew is happy with it, I don't care.
