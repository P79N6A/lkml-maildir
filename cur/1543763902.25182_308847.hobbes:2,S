That design sounds bad.
Anyway, I guess the error you are getting might have some thing to do with
the "." and ".." entry. Your current directory need to in the same
format as well. That is the price you pay for breaking the compatibility.

In the same directory, if there are 2 files stored by different users, their inodes will be encrypted with different keys. If user1 is doing "ls" on that directory, the inode of the other file - which is encrypted by user2, will be decrypted by using user1's key, resulting into garbage. To avoid this, I am trying to store the uid in the directry entry, so that  I can match it with current->fsuid and skip decrypting the inode if the file doesn't belong to the current user. (assuming user1 doesnt want to share that file and different users can store different files under same directory.)
