   Hi
   This is my first post here, bear with me if I'm not providing enough 
detail.
   I have found what seems to be a problem with the ieee1394 (Firewire) driver 
in 2.6.0-test2. The driver works (for me) only if compiled as a module, not 
compiled statically into the kernel. When compiled statically, it aborts 
loading complaining that it cannot find the module. This module is of course 
not around, since the driver is compiled in.
   The problem has been there since I started toying around with 2.5.3X. 
    My computer is a generic Athlon XP 1800+, with a very generic (read: 
cheapo) Firewire controller. 
   Have fun!
