But you are reference counting a static object, right?  Which isn't the
nicest thing to have done.  Why not just dynamically create it?

No, if you have that .owner field in your driver, you get a symlink in
sysfs that points from your driver to the module that controls it.  You
just removed that symlink, which is not what I think you wanted to have
happen :(
I also think you don't get the module reference counting for your
driver's and devices sysfs files but haven't looked deep enough to see
if this is true for your code or not.  Should be easy for you to test,
just open a sysfs file for your device and see if the module reference
is incremented or not.
thanks,
