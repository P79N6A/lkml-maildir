I encountered several errors in 2.6.0-test4-bk8 and bk9 relating to the 
PPC architecture.
Please do not CC back any of the comments.
I run gentoo linux (all programes are upto date) on my ibook.
1. Doing the correct kernel config needed for my ibook i ran make and 
found this.
arch/ppc/platforms/pmac_cpufreq.c: In function `pmac_cpufreq_cpu_init':
arch/ppc/platforms/pmac_cpufreq.c:260: `CPUFREQ_DEFAULT_GOVERNOR' 
undeclared (first use in this function)
arch/ppc/platforms/pmac_cpufreq.c:260: (Each undeclared identifier is 
reported only once
arch/ppc/platforms/pmac_cpufreq.c:260: for each function it appears in.)
2. After i preformed a make allyesconfig and a make i found this.
