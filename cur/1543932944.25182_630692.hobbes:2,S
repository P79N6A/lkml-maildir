if i were reading the above for the first time, i would have no idea
what was being embedded where.  "embeds a kobject" where?  what's
being embedded in what?  that sentence doesn't make it clear.  what's
the current definition for a "struct kobject"?

and if it does, whose responsibility is it to provide one?  mine?
that's not clear.

i doubt that.   i wouldn't say that the ktype "controls" what happens,
i would say that it "defines" what happens.  to control suggests
active participation.
