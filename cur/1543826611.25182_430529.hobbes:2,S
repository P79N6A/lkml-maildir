Hi,
I am trying to check how many slabs are used for inode_cache, but
found that all slabs are added to slabs_full list, and slabs_partial
is always empty. Even if the active object number does not exactly
occupy all slabs.
Does that mean Linux 2.6 remove the use of slabs_partial?
Another question, the constructor transfered to the
kmem_cache_create() function is called for every object in a slab when
it is created. Is this true? Is there any way to call back a function
_only once_ when a new slab is allocated?
Thanks,
Xin
