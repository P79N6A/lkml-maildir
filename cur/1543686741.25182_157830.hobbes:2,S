Yes, I understand that, but that is wrong for GFP_DMA imho. Also, 
SLAB_MUST_HWCACHE_ALIGN just disables redzoning, which is not smart,
I'd rather allocate more and keep both redzoning and cache alignement,
that would help catch some of those subtle problems when a chip DMA
engine plays funny tricks

Of course it should, but it doesn't yet. And other drivers haven't been
ported yet neither though that is slowly happening. Still, I think the
point that a GFP_DMA should be cache aligned still stands, don't you
think ?
