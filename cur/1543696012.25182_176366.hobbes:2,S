I enabled ACPI, and the interrupts are now assigned correctly,
and in the range of 48-51:
           CPU0       CPU1       
 48:        878        389   IO-APIC-level  piraq
 49:        923        336   IO-APIC-level  piraq
 50:      17239        838   IO-APIC-level  ioc2, piraq
 51:        879        404   IO-APIC-level  piraq
They are now getting handled properly, i.e. I am receiveing 
interrupts from the boards located in the backplane extender. 
This is with 2.4.22.
I didn't realize that ACPI is related to interrupt management 
as well as power control. Is there any downside to using ACPI?
Thanks,
Charlie
