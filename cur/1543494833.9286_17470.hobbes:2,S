The relevant code in linux/fs/open.c concurs.  get_unused_fd()
includes this bit (at least in 2.2.7-ac1):
        if (fd >= current->rlim[RLIMIT_NOFILE].rlim_cur)
                goto out;
At that point error is set to -EMFILE and out: will just return error;.
EMFILE is of course too many open files.
So, if RLIMIT_NOFILE is 0, new files cannot be opened.
The question still remains.  Should reducing either of:
        current->rlim[RLIMIT_NOFILE].rlim_cur
        current->rlim[RLIMIT_NOFILE].rlim_max
close all fds above the new limit?  Probably not for rlim_cur, but
what about rlim_max?  And even if not in the general case, what about
the special case of setting both to zero?
An alternative, of course, whould be a syscall that returns an array
of all the currently open fds.
Another would be a flag for all of the syscalls that deal w/ fds that
says apply this to every open fd.  That would allow an efficient way
of setting the close on exec bit for each open fd.
In any case, ther *must* be an elegant, efficient, lean solution out
there, hiding out there in someone's (sub)conscience....  :)
