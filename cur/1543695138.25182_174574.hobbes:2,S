I have sent the attached patches sometimes to the list/Marcelo, and they
have been rejected to the moment because:
- gcc can spit some new instructions, reorganize code and other things when
  you jump from i686 to pentium3, for example.
- There can be bugs both in gcc and in the kernel that can be triggered by
  >i686 optimizations/code.
- This is not safe for a stable kernel, it was done in 2.5, bugs appeared,
  were corrected, and so on, 'cause this was a development kernel.
BTW, I use this regularly, and have not found any bugs, but I admit it is
unsafe. I also advocate for a pII split (I use a dual PII ;).
There are some other specific code that could be used in the kernel,
for example mb() and so on can be implemented with {m,s,l}fence in p3/p4
processors, instead of the old 'lock; insn' (attached also).
