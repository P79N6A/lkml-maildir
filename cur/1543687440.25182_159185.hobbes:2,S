The reserve IRQ feature in your BIOS should not effect the linux kernel.
It is strictly internal to your BIOS.  Therefore if linux assigns
resources it probably won't reserve irq 5.  This problem may be the
result of a change in the way linux assigns resources.

In what kernel version did you first see this problem?

I'd imagine this is the result of the resource conflict, presumably with
your ide controller.  More information would be needed.  I'd like to see
/proc/interrupts, dmesg, and lspci -vv (when the sb driver is not loaded).
Also, are you using acpi?  If so, try the kernel parameter pci=noacpi and
also try disabling acpi completely.
Thanks,
Adam
