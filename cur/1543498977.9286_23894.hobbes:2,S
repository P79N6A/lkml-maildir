Subject: netlink broken in 2.3.6
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I enabled all the netlink stuff, would not compile,
turned all the netlink stuff (and ip6 stuff) off
worked fine...
attached is my current .config, (after I turned off netlink and ipv6)
and below is the compiler error stuff...
