It's a grey area.
debian-legal did pick one of the possible opinions on this matter.
The similarities between the GFDL and the firmware discussion can be 
described with the following two questions:
Is it true, that the removal of much of the documentation in Debian is 
scheduled soon because it's covered by the GFDL, that this is called an 
"editorial change", and that Debian doesn't actually care that this will 
e.g. remove all documentation about available options of the standard C 
compiler used by and shipped with Debian?
Is it true, that Debian will leave users with hardware affected by the 
firmware problem without a working installer in Debian 3.1?
The point is simply, that Debian does more and more look dogmatic at 
it's definition of "free software" without caring about the effects to 
it's users.
As a contrast, read the discussion between Christoph and Arjan in a part 
of this thread how to move firmware out of kernel drivers without 
problems for the users. This might not happen today, but it's better for 
the users.
