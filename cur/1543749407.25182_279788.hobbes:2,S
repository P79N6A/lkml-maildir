You were able to get the NVidia driver to work? Most of my machines have
the NVidia card (yes evil, but I like them) and I haven't been able to
get them to work on the rc3-mm1 (and a few earlier). Grant you, I didn't
try hard, but I did try a little on V0.7.33-0, and gave up later. 
How did you get by the...
1) pgd_offset_k_is_obsolete (not too hard, just a few patches for me)
2) class_simple_create and friends going to GPL (I just removed the GPL
from my code)
3) for Ingo's patches only, the might_sleep in the os_interface section.
having interrupts turned off. (here's where mine failed, I tried saving
and restoring them, turning them on that is, backwards from the normal
local_irq_save, and it would just be unstable here).
Do you have it working for the 2.6.10-rc3-mm1 without Ingo's patches?
Thanks,
