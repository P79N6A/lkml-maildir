I'm aware of that. But look at the trouble we have even with the 
cooperative vendors. I'm sure they had a Windows driver from day zero.

As others pointed out, rev-eng of programmable 3D hardware will be 
difficult. There will be a perpetual (and long) lag between the 
introduction of hardware and Linux support. The effort has to repeat for 
new revisions of the hardware. And a rev-eng driver can still not be 
trusted: who knows whether the register you just wrote into doesn't have 
some subtle side-effect.

I want some too.
I don't think Windows drivers are the best, or even a good solution. But 
that may be the only realistic one. And I believe quite doable.
