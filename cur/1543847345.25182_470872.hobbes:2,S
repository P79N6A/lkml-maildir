Subject: [PATCH 1/3] i386/x86_64: FIX pci_enable_irq to set dev->irq to the irq number
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

In commit: ace80ab796ae30d2c9ee8a84ab6f608a61f8b87b  I removed
the weird logic that used the vector number as the irq number
when MSI was defined.  However pci_enable_irq was using a different test
in the io_apic_assign_irqs path and I missed it :(
This patch removes the wrong code so no one hits this problem.
This code is only active when a specific set of boot command line
parameters is specified which likely explains why no one has
notices this earlier.
