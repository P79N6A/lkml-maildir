It is not implicit. "This instruction can be used with the lock prefix";
"In order to simplify interface to the processor's bus, the destination
operand receives a write cycle without regard to the result of the
comparison. DEST is writtem back back if the comparison fails, and SRC
is written into the destination otherwise. (The processor never produces
a locked read without also producing a locked write)". pp 26-63 Intel's
'486 rag.
Note that, without locking, the destination receiving the first write-
cycle, i.e., a copy of the source, may receive the wrong value if
either source or destination changes. Therefore you need the lock
prefix for atomic operations.
