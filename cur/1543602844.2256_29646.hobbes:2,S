yes, acenic.c (and the card itself) supports irq-rate limitation and
work-coalescing. Almost all gigabit cards do. Check out the tx_coal_tick,
rx_coal_tick, max_tx_dsc, max_rx_desc tunables that can be set at insmod
time. Note that this does not decrease the amount of work generated, but
it will reduce the irq-processing overhead significantly.
The eepro100 card does not provide such ways - there the only way to stop
future interrupts from happening is to stop the receiver, or to not refill
the rx-skb queue. (or disable the interrupt, which is a pretty crude and
inaccurate method.)
