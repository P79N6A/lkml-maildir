Sorry complex situation. Andrew wants the warnings, Linus wants the 
ZERO_SIZE_PTR. Not sure where we are going here.

Well so far we agreed to keep the warnings in at least till release data 
and I have not heard differently yet.

Heheheh.... Mind boogling isnt it? Patch duplicity....
Seriously: Andrew/Linus could you make up your mind which way we are 
going here? 
I'd say lets drop the DEVELKERNEL stuff and the warnings and go with 
ZERO_SIZE_PTR. The DEVELKERNEL patch has the danger that subtle changes 
occur at release time that we have not anticipated.
