As far as I can tell, vmware-mount should be re-implemented as a
little perl script around "dmsetup" and/or "losetup", possibly with
"dm-userspace" patched into the kernel to allow you to handle
non-mapped blocks in your userspace daemon when somebody tries to
access them.  If you don't need that ability then straight dm-loop and
dm-linear will work.
