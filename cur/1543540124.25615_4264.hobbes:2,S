I read that document, but the actual source doesn't match this
definition:
Just check atomic_read() and atomic_set(): they don't act as memory
barrier's, not even on i386. s390 is the only architecture that contains
a memory barrier within atomic_read().

Or check the simple test_bit() macro: it isn't a memory barrier on i386.

IMHO we should define the restriction, and then modify <asm-*/atomic.h>
and <asm-*/bitops.h> accordingly.
And an unconditional memory barrier in every atomic operation would be
very expensive.
