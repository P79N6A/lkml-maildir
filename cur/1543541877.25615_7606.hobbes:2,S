Just to elaborate on this a bit:
1. Many of the examples rely on ISA MMIO memory not requiring ioremap() -
readb(0xC0000)-style accesses are invalid now, either use isa_readb or
ioremap.
2. The statements about bus addresses are mostly outdated.  Since most
drivers care about PCI DMA only and we have a new API for that, those
sections should just be removed.

As far as I understand, the architecture in question has the following setup:
both MMIO and memory are accessed using the same bus.  The PCI bridge
translates memory bus addresses 0x80000000 ... to PCI bus addresses starting
with 0;  other I/O on the memory bus (flash) has its MMIO range starting at
0x40000000.
The current setup is that the addresses in struct pci_dev (which are passed
to ioremap() by PCI drivers) start at 0 (and ioremap() fixes them up so they
actually end up as memory bus addresses starting at 0x80000000), and there
is no easy way to remap the other I/O at memory bus addresses 0x40000000
(Russell, wouldn't passing 0xC0000000 to ioremap() work ?)).
I proposed to Russell to change ioremap()'s address argument to be the memory
bus address (so starting at 0x80000000 for PCI devices) and handle the offset
in architecture-specific pcibios_* functions.
As I understand the current API, both setups would be correct (i.e. should
work with portable PCI device drivers).  The only real difference is how it
handles devices not behind the PCI bridge, and there don't seem to be that
many of those.
