If Promise has changed their policy and went off from i2o "standard" it's 
the good idea, but unfortunatelly I'm c/c++ newbie :-(. I can offer 
you access to my test machine with SX6000 installed. I even have to two 
SX 6000 so you want you can test new and old version of firmware in the 
same time.
