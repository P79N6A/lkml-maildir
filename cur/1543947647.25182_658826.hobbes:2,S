I missed it the first time you posted it, so thanks for resending.

Does using this patch reduce the safety of the kernel build at all? i.e.
is it more likely to build different parts of the kernel with
incompatible options with this patch, compared to if the options were
specified in the Makefile?

I'm currently cleaning up the Kconfig help descriptions to try to help
the second group of people. Also I think there's a spectrum of
capabilities involved. I'd like kernel building to be a fun and useful
activity for a wider group of people :-)

Heh, that includes me too.

I've just started using StGit and it makes it a lot easier to make, send
and manage patches. You should take a look at it.

Sorry, but I don't think we need shouting. There are a few options
already which have bad results if you unknowingly choose the wrong option,
like enabling EMBEDDED and turning off the BLOCK layer, yet the help
description doesn't shout.
Can I suggest:
	help
	  You can use this to easily set custom gcc CFLAGS to be used
	  for the entire kernel build process (including modules).
	  Compiler flags can be used for increasing or reducing
	  optimisation, enabling debugging, cross compilation
	  and so on.
	  If unsure, leave blank.
The boilerplate "If unsure, leave blank" covers (or is meant to cover)
the situation where the user does not know what they are doing. It says
"If you don't know what you are doing, just leave this field blank,
and everything will be OK" ... except it is put in a non-threatening,
non-demeaning way.
The paragraph in the middle enhances the "help" component of the help
description, by saying why you might want to use that option.

Similar comments apply.
