Adrian,
according to a quick test I made right now it is a regression post 2.6.20.
# modprobe ohci1394   # wait a bit, eth1394 is auto-loaded
# modprobe -r eth1394
# modprobe -r ohci1394
works.
# modprobe ohci1394   # wait a bit, eth1394 is auto-loaded
# modprobe -r ohci1394
oopses with the same trace as Ismael posted. And indeed, looking at his
trace once more I now also spot eth1394 among his linked-in modules.
Ismail, if you have the opportunity, the next thing you could test would
be to unload eth1394 explicitly before ohci1394 on 2.6.21-rc3. This
would _not_ oops according to my observation.
Thanks to Ismail's link to the similar report on 2.6.19-rc5-mm2 we
already have a hot candidate to be the trigger (not necessarily to be
the actual bug):
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=43cb76d91ee85f579a69d42bc8efc08bac560278
"Network: convert network devices to use struct device instead of
class_device"
Alas I didn't remember that older 2.6.19-rc5-mm2 discussion when I saw
Greg's pull request with this conversion patch (February 7) and didn't
react and test Linus' newest.
Advice would be appreciated...
