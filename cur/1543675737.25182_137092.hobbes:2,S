no, here it's more than "a single klick will write 5-10 chars". it is 
_not_ repeated to the infinite. and no, both kbds are OK (2.4.20-rc3 works)

on X and console.

no, i don't think it's appliation related. to actuallay _use_ my system 
i have to login. and to do that, i will write my username / password. 
and to do that, i have to unplug/replug my keyboard.
since i have other module issues right now i'm on 2.4.20rc3 again. what 
i have done yesterday in the evening was this:
- i compiled 2.5.70 again, input/usb support statically include but with 
a modular  CONFIG_USB_KBD (usbkbd) and a modular CONFIG_KEYBOARD_ATKBD 
(atkbd). then i rebooted, logged in via remote console where i was able 
to load "atkbd" and "usbkbd". then both kbds were up *in a sane way* !!
so this would be the workaround for me.
i wonder when the problem will diesappear as it did on linux/alpha :-)
Thanks for comments,
Christian.
