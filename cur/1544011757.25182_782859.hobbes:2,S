Could someone kindly explain why I see these warnings:
warning: passing argument X of 'SOME_TYPE_HERE' discards qualifiers from
pointer target type.
I know *what* is causing the error - it's a cast removing a const
e.g.  
void foo(const my_type *a)
{
	bar( (my_type*)a );
}
What I don't understand is that it only seems to be emitted when I
compile on my 32 bit machine.  Compiling on my 64bit machine does not
generate this warning
Thank you,
Jack
