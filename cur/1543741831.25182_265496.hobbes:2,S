Well, it depends on your perspective :)
Each scatterlist entry is supposed to map to a physical segment to be
passed to h/w.  Hardware S/G tables just want to see a addr/len pair,
and don't care about machine page size.  scatterlist follows a similar
model.
dma_map_sg() and other helpers create a favorable situation, where >90%
of the drivers don't have to care about the VM-size details.
Unfortunately those drivers that need need to do their own data transfer
(like ATA's PIO, instead of DMA) need direct access to each member of an
s/g list.
