I think we should just remove it.
It's broken.
Nobody cares.
If people want to do concurrent stuff at bootup, it should be the _other_ 
buses (like USB, IDE or SCSI or anything like that, that actually has 
operations that can delay) that end up asynchronous. And I think we could 
have some generic functionality for the drivers themselves to do their 
probing in parallel. But I think the PCI one was just a mistake.
