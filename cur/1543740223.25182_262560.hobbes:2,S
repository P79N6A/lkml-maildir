Hmm...  It misses a bunch of easy stuff, actually (tons of casts to void *
from what used to be unsigned long and is void __iomem * with your patch).
I don't see where you handle PIO stuff, though - no ioport_map() _or_
pci_iomap() in sight.  Note that ioport_map() is not equivalent to a cast -
we add a constant there.  How does ioread/iowrite work on the results?
