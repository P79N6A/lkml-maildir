Oh, I agree that BK makes things possible that didn't happen before.
The only downside is that now Linus _assumes_ you can see what he's
doing - because that makes less work for him - which is fair enough

Anyway, I am mostly satisfied with the hourly patch link that Andrew
Morton pointed me to.
Thanks,
