Cool, thanks.

Oh, I notice that I have been dumb here. Of course `make kernelrelease`
should not depend on `make .kernelrelease` or alter .kernelrelease in any
way.

But then - for this I would use `cat .kernelrelease` ?

Yes, these may be different, and both are interesting:
1. What name would I get if I started building now.
2. Assuming I did not modify anything since the last build, what was it
named?

Right. Only I get this also with `cat .kernelrelease`.
That's why my intuition said, `make kernelrelease` probably prints the
string
that *would* be appended, based on all the knowledge in the Makefile.
After all, this is interesting, since that composition is not trivial,
and the
logic is inside the Makefile.
Maybe this could be made another target?
`make upcomingrelease` (-;
