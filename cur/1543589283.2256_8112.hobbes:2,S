Whatever happened to that hack that was discussed a year or two ago?
The one where (also on IA32) a magic page was set up by the kernel
containing code for fast system calls, and the kernel would write
calibation information to that magic page. The code written there
would use the TSC in conjunction with that calibration data.
There was much discussion about this idea, even Linus was keen on
it. But IIRC, nothing ever happened.
