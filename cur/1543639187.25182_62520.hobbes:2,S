at least, the kernel and patches you are talking about are *announced*
here, so that people have a clue about changes between versions.

do you remember one of these vendors announcing their kernels with their
changelog here ? I think that could be a good idea anyway, because that
would tell us what set of patches they found to be stable, but unfortunately,
they don't at the moment. So nobody knows what's in without pulling regularly
their new packages from their respective sites.

If you want to help, ask these vendors to post their errata here, associated
with the bug reports, so that anyone can benefit from it.
Cheers,
