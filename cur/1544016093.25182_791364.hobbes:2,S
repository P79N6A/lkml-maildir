Hi,
I don't have Lenovo T61 but I seem to experience similar resume problem
with Fujitsu Siemens E series notebook except for auto-resume issue
which I have never experienced.

This patch reverted helped to get my machine back up (if I suspend from X)
from s2r but screen is blank until I try to get to text console and
back. 
I have tried to run the test suggested by Rafael, but I am not able to
resume (see attached suspend&resume log with Sysrq+T at the end).  
I can see the following BUG during resume:
[...]

I am not able to resume from the text console (e.g. with init=/bin/sh
results in the blanks screen) but when I resume from X and try to change
to a text console I cannot see anything (X seems to work correctly).
