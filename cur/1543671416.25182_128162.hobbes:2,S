You aren't any better(tm).
I guess there was SCM Software before Bitkeeper, so your are "cloning"
other people concepts yourself. (At least in the beginning.)
When you count every lego-brick in the software, how many of them are
"original" (=100% invented by Bitmover. Including the ideas. Excluding
the ones that you only weren't aware of existing)?
0.01%?

Real Programmers consider "what you see is what you get" to be just as 
bad a concept in Text Editors as it is in women. No, the Real Programmer
wants a "you asked for it, you got it" text editor -- complicated, 
cryptic, powerful, unforgiving, dangerous.
