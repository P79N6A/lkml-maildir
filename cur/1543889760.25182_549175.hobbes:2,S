Exactly.
And the freezing of user land has _nothing_ to do with that.  The fact is
the user land is not reliable while device drivers are being suspended,
regardless of whether it's frozen at that point or not.
BTW, we are going (or at least I'm going) to untangle the hibernation and
suspend code paths, but I have limited time for that and I just _can't_ do this
any faster.  In the meantime, we have bugs like this one that need to be fixed
_within_ the current limitations, because we just _can't_ remove these
limitations overnight..
Greetings,
