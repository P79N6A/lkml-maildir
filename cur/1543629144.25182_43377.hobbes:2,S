I must control the serial port at kernel level, because I have to make several measurements of one-way delay between a source and a destination host, so while I set the DTR on the source host when I send the UDP packet, the destination host must be able to set by itself the RTS when it receives the packet.
I'm quite a beginner in Linux-kernel, so may you help me more?
Thanks again
Antonello
