Hi,
thank you for your extensive review, I will fix and resubmitt. Anyway
I learned an important lesson: checkpatch.pl will be my best friend.
Sorry I haven't read about it earlier.
Just a question:

It's used in the machine definition file for platform devices that
cannot be autoprobed. Anyway where is the best place to put such
struct definition / include files? And what is the best way to
document them (if not inline)? For example I put in my machine
definition file (let's say arch/arm/mach-s3c2410/mach-smdk2410.c):
static struct plat_max3100 max3100_plat_data = {
        .loopback = 0,
        .crystal = 0,
        .only_edge_irq = 0,
};
static struct spi_board_info spi_board_info[] = {
        {
                .modalias       = "max3100",
                .platform_data  = &max3100_plat_data,
                .irq            = IRQ_EINT12,
                .max_speed_hz   = 5*1000*1000,
                .chip_select    = 0,
        },
};
...
   spi_register_board_info(spi_board_info, ARRAY_SIZE(spi_board_info));
