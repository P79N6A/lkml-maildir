I think this is where more details on a design will help.  What I'm
thinking is each address_space to have a container pointer.  In this
case, pages belonging to a file will charge against one single container
(irrespective of how many processes are touching those pages).

Sure that some resources it wouldn't make sense to move (or find out at
which is the real owner).  And I'm not saying that we have to bind them
hard to a process either...but to a single container if they belong to a
same file (for example).
