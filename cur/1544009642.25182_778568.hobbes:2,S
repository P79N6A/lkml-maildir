Hi Ingo,
  I was able to reproduce your first error (in the previous mail) by
turning off CONFIG_SMP.  I have folded your fix into my series and got
past it.  However, I was not able to reproduce these two new errors.  I
was thinking that perhaps something merged improperly between my (older)
tip/master and the merge point in cpus4096.  So I rebased the series on
your latest tip/master as of this morning, but it still builds fine for
me.  Could you send me the .config that causes this to blow up?  I will
get it straightened out for you ASAP.  Sorry for the inconvenience.
Thanks,
-Greg
