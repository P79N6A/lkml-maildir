The only that this does that is not done pretty much equivalently
by pageattr-test.c (it just checks G instead of W) is testing the kernel 
text mapping on 64bit. On 32bit it is fully redundant I believe.
Testing the kernel mapping might be a good idea, but I would
suggest adding it to pageattr-test.c
Yes I'm sure these basic facts will not stop it from being 
applied anyways; just wanted to point it out for the benefit
of the list readers.
