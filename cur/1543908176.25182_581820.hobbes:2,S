Hi.
I installed Ubuntu 7.04 and then upgraded to the future 7.10 on my
system based on an Asus Pundit barebone with 512 mb RAM and 120 Gb IDE
hard disk.
The system works without any problem, but when I try to shutdown or
restart the system, after a while during the shutdown process, the
system hangs and I see this error:
[87.935473] BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual
address 6d207972
[...........] printing eip:

snd_emux_synth snd_seq_virmidi snd_seq_midi_emul  [....] etc.
I'm using the kernel 2.6.22.
I'm omitting the rest of the error because it is very very long and I
have to rewrite it because I can't copy&paste it. If you need some
other information please ask. :-)
Could you help me, please? What could be the problem?
Thank you very much!
Bye.
