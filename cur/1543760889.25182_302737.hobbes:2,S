Unfortunately, I have not much time for it now, so I can't expect
release of 0.9.3 version, which is going to have the patch, earlier than
in May. But I'm ready to publish 0.9.3-pre1 as well as some bugfixes in
the Qlogic driver in the nearest future, as soon as I settle down some
untechnical stuff. If somebody is interested, I can send him a copy
privately. As before, it still has ZERO modifications of the kernel, so
it could live perfectly outside the tree.
Also, everybody who think that he/she can help in testing,
developing, bugfixing or just commenting/suggesting are welcome.
