   You may give a try at this my patch I've done now (the first part is a
   jiffy wrap fix I catched today and is unrelated). 
Andrea, I've applied your jiffies fix, that is correct.
I'm curious about the other part.  Changing prune_queue()'s behavior
is not such a good idea, if the effect we want to change is in the
caller.
For example, if we change tcp_data() to do the wakeup even if
prune_queue() returns < 0 solve the select problem here?
If so just send me a patch which introduces a local variable 'ret' for
the return value, and a goto to the wakeup code if prune_queue() says
to toss the packet, and I'll put it in as this seems to be a safe
change.
Later,
