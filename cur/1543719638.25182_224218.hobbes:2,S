My keyboard has a separate key for SysRq (as much as 
'separate' makes sense for laptop keyboards; it's a Fn-
activated key).
If you want to go the route you're going, all laptop keyboards 
should have the numeric keypad produce the same emulated 
scancodes as some alphanumeric keys. This does sound a little, 
uhm, ridiculous to me.
