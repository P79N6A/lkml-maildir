I'd recommend the following dependencies:
Rule 1:
If SiS DRM is selected, SiS framebuffer *MUST* be selected as well
Rule 2:
If SiS framebuffer is a MODULE, SiS DRM *MUST* be a MODULE, too
Rule 3:
If SiS DRM is compiled into the kernel (which I don't recommend), sisfb
*MUST* be compiled into the kernel, too.
(SiS framebuffer can be inside the kernel, in this case DRM can be a
module)
