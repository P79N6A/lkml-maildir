I think that's more than just that.
when you have a problem you want to be able to quickly have a netbootable
kernel not spend time making initrd images.
One could argue that you should have ready emergency disks ahead of time,
but in my experience by time you need a boot disk something changes and
they are not what you expect them be. for example I have there this box
with 460+ days of uptime... the sources for the kernel I used to compile
it are long gone, heck I even don't remember what ethernet card it has
anymore (dmesg output is long gone, an I'm too lazy to open the box up,
but for sure it is not a pci card.. )
Another issue is development of new machines. when you port to a new 
machine, it come out handy be to able to simply netboot it. 
perhaps it would be a good idea to instead putting everything into
initrd, to follow the patch netbsd took and simply make two stage
boot loader. I think it might be more flexible than initrd is. 
I haven't looked at it for a while, but IIRC the first stage would 
do basic booting (bootp?) then load the proper kernel and pass 
ip options to it.
