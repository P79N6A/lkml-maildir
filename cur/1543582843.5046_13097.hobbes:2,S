Well, you are quite convincing.  I am keen to see if I can measure a
performance difference for ext2/raid5, but unfortuantely I don't have
any 4-way boxed (only duals).
If you progress with this can create any patches that do more
interesting things than just drop the lock (e.g. protect the export
table or the read-ahead cache properly), let me know and I will
certainly take them.  Meanwhile I will try to find time to have a look
myself.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
