Yes. it is this I was trying to say :)

I don't have any saa7146 board, but, on bttv, most boards don't have its
own PCI ID.

This seems to be an interesting idea: to make stradis just probe the
recognized IDs and the generic one. It won't solve, however, the probing
intersection for dpc7146f, hexium_orion, mxb, and stradis when no
subvendor ID is specified on the board.
