And how do you do the invalidate the other way, pray tell?
What happens if you create a buffer cache entry? Does that invalidate the
page cache one? Or do you just allow invalidates one way, and not the
other? And why=

Ehh.. And then you'll be unhappy _again_, when we early in 2.5.x start
using the page cache for block device accesses. Which we _have_ to do if
we want to be able to mmap block devices. Which we _do_ want to do (hint:
DVD's etc).
Face it. What you ask for is stupid and fundamentally unworkable. 
Tell me WHY you are completely ignoring my arguments, when I (a) tell you
why your way is bad and stupid (and when you ignore the arguments, don't
complain when I call you stupid) and (b) I give you alternate ways to do
the same thing, except my suggestion is _faster_ and has none of the
downside yours has.
WHY?
