  ??? If the current value is 10, and supports 10 interfaces, and I
believe that is the case, why should he need a value of 15 to get 14?
Doesn't the off by one error happen on smaller values, or what?
  I am NOT disagreeing with you, I just don't see how to code an off by
one and have it work some of the time and not others.

  I thought devfs was supposed to eliminate all this stuff and replace
names with long hierarchical names. In hindsight it probably would have
been better to call drives something like hdNNX, where NN is the interface
and X is m or s. Hum, I wonder how hard that would be as a retrofit?

  Right. I would be interested in this one myself, but I don't have a good
way of getting that many drives attached. I have a pile of old Promise
ATA33 cards, and I could come up with a hundred 400-500MB drives, but the
case and cabling is a serious issue.
  Anyway, if you have a moment to hint why an off by one error is not
biting us on ten drives I'd be interested.
