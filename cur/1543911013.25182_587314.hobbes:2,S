Arg, don't make me dig out my spec, I don't have it handy...

Well, the Altix hw by itself won't honor device hints (I'm not even sure if 
there are devices that honor order hints like you outline above).  However, 
Altix could track per-device ordering as long as arch code was called from 
such a hook.

I think it would have to be the latter, since otherwise it would be hard to 
setup just completion queue requests to be ordered.
