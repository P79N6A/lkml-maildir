NO, I have the death of one disk on my wall of shame because of VIA and
mistimed.  I will not have another dead disk added to a once spotless
wall.  This is foolish.  You do not drive 60MPH through a school zone just
because you do not see kids.  There will allows be a lose soccer ball
popping into the road followed by a child.  As there will be systems that
are U66 fully capable but the ribbon is not present.
Yeah, this make no sense but neither does defaulting to U66.
