Subject: mouse problem on 2.6.0-test9-bk9

I recently patched 2.6.0-test9 to 2.6.0-test9-bk9.  Hard disk cache read
timings on /dev/hda went from 13 to 24 MB/sec, and on /dev/hdb from 24
to 28 MB/sec.  The problem is that my mouse became slow.  It was very
fast in 2.6.0-test9, but with bk9 it became very slow (4 edge-to-edge
drags across the mouse pad to go across the screen).  "xset m 9 1"
works, but I am at times unable to resize windows (the mouse is skipping
over the edge of the window).  Option "Resolution" "250" in Section
"InputDevice" of XF86Config and restarting the X server does not work
either (nor does substituting for 250 : 15, 100, 500, 2000, 15000). 
It's a minor thing, but it would be nice to change the mouse speed
again.
Thanks in advance.
