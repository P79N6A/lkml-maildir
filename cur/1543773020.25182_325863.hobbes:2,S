Yes, and as I suggested, this is best done via out-of-band
notification system, such as hotplug or dbus.

We could try to add some complicated exception system into system
calls, but it's not productive in my opnion.  First of all, backwards
compatibility is an absolute and unconditional requirement (we can't
break POSIX compatibility, and more importantly, we don't want to
change the number of applications that Linux can run from being
Linux-like to being BeOS-like).  This adds enough of a constraint that
I doubt trying to add changes to the system call error handling
mechanism is likely to work well.  
Secondly, if the goal is to have a pop-up show when there is some
major hardware problem, changing the system call error handling
doesn't really help us unless we want to require every single
application in existence to be modified to use this new exception
handling system.  Having seen how well this BeOS-like approach has
worked for BeOS, I believe this is a Really Bad Idea.  It's better to
have a separate, out-of-band notification scheme --- it's what dbus is
really designed to be for.

We put these policy options as options in the superblock, but there
are some advantages in being able to override them at mount-time with
mount options.  For example, one such advantage is that we can
standardize them across different filesystems.
However, even if we do have standardized mount options, it is a real
pain to have to type a very long mount option when doing manual
mounts.  So having defaults that can be stored in the superblock seems
to be a good idea, in my opinion.
