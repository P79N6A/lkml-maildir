Hello Everyone;
On my embedded system having 64MB of RAM and no swap,
I see the  following information on opening
/proc/meminfo:
       total:    used:    free:  shared: buffers: 
cached:
Mem:  62894080 47947776 14946304        0  4964352
23674880
Swap:        0        0        0

MemFree:         14596 kB

As I see the total memory belonging to page cache is 
23MB and the anonymous list is 10MB. But if I count
the RSS values for all the processes running on the
system, it hardly comes to 15MB. Where is the rest of
the 18MB? If I understand the "cached:" = (pages in
the page cache - buffer cache). Even if I am doing
lots of file activity; I cannot imagine the file
system reads and writes holding up 18MB of the page 
cache. Am I missing something here?
Thanks in advance
Editya
