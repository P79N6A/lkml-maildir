Wrong.  We have a fix that has been under serious testing for a long time.

Wrong, too.  We have a patch that will be coming SOON (trust me, I am
pushing hard for the author to publish it).  With this patch applied you
should never see the TSC go backwards.  Period.  It should be monotonic
(to userspace, kernel rdtsc calls can still be wrong).  CPUs should stay
very nearly in sync (again, to userspace).  The overhead of this patch is
pretty minimal and costs nothing unless you actually read the TSC.
The catch is that, while it is monotonic, it is not guaranteed to be
perfectly linear.  For many applications, this will be good enough.  Time
will always move forward, and you won't be subject to the weird HZ
granularity gettimeofday that unsynced TSCs can show.
I'm BCCing the author to poke him more publicly.
