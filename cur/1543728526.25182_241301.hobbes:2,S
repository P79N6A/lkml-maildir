Normally BIOS and windows drivers doing their raid. It isn't entirely
that simple. The 3ware is hardware raid as are some of the other high
end devices (eg aacraid sata boards). There are also some low end
devices with part of the raid logic in hardware (some promise) although
I don't believe we use that to the full yet.
I'm currently trying to fix up the IT8212 which is an older PATA board
which does have real h/w raid 0/1
