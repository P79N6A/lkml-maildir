I have a dual processor PII 350.  I have been running it for a while with
no trouble.  Today however it locked up solid.  This is something I have
never seen in Linux.  I have always gotten some error message or
something.  What I would like to know is what I can do to attempt to get
usefull debugging info if this ever happens again.
