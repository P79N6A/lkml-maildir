I'm inclined to agree that given a good compiler, C++ should be a good
choice for kernel development - except I seem to recall in that operating
system thread we had a couple weeks ago, the EROS people saying they
regretted choosing C++ and planned to reimplement in C.
That statement has been on my mind a lot since then; perhaps one of the EROS
folk would be willing to provide some details?
