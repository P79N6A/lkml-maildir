Only in 2.4.19rc1aa2: 000_e100-2.0.30-k1.gz
Only in 2.4.19rc1aa2: 000_e1000-4.2.17-k1.gz
Only in 2.4.19rc1aa1: 07_e100-1.8.38.gz
Only in 2.4.19rc1aa1: 08_e100-includes-1
Only in 2.4.19rc1aa1: 09_e100-compilehack-1
	New patch.
Only in 2.4.19rc1aa2: 00_drop-broken-flock-account-1
	per-task flock accounting was broken across tasks sharing the same
	files. Removed temporarly. This should fix sendmail. If somebody
	wanted to bypass the rlimit he needed simply to use fcntl instead
	so it's not going to make much difference for 2.4. Fix from
	Matthew Wilcox.
Only in 2.4.19rc1aa1: 00_o_direct-open-check-1
Only in 2.4.19rc1aa2: 10_o_direct-open-check-2
	Rediffed and changed some check for ->mapping that didn't made much
	sense (if either mapping or a_ops are missing we shouldn't let O_DIRECT
	to succeed either).
Only in 2.4.19rc1aa2: 00_parport_pc-compile-1
	Compile parport_pc from Eyal Lebedinsky.
Only in 2.4.19rc1aa2: 00_poll-speedup-1
	This allocates some hundred bytes from the stack to handle most
	poll common cases, with a small number of fd. At least the stack hungry
	places aren't going to be stacked one on top of the other (i.e. poll
	cannot run under follow_link etc..). Patch from Andi Kleen.
Only in 2.4.19rc1aa2: 00_setfl-race-fix-1
	Fix race with ->fasync and O_DIRECT fcntl F_SETFL. O_DIRECT
	problem noticed by Matthew Wilcox, fasync problem noticed by
	Marcus Alanen.
Only in 2.4.19rc1aa2: 10_o1-sched-updates-A4-3
Only in 2.4.19rc1aa1: 20_o1-sched-updates-A4-2
	Rediffed before rcu_poll.
Only in 2.4.19rc1aa1: 10_rcu-poll-6
Only in 2.4.19rc1aa2: 20_rcu-poll-7
	Fixed potential starvation if idle task was scheduled by the time
	force_cpu_reschedule was executed. Also the original o1
	force_cpu_reschedule implementation for 2.5 was not correct. This new
	corrected one is getting merged soon into the rcu-poll for 2.5 too.
Only in 2.4.19rc1aa2: 50_uml-patch-2.4.18-36.gz
	New update from Jeff.
Only in 2.4.19rc1aa1: 90_acpi-2.5.24-1.gz
	Dropped, my laptop had an hardware problem so I'm not going to test it
	soon. Also it needed the backport of the pci-irq enable callbacks, it
	was very near to be finished. If my future laptop will deadlock at boot
	again with the 2.4 ACPI I will be willing to finish it :).  If somebody
	wants to contine on its own I've an unreleased -2 revision that was a
	bit more uptodate than the above one too.
Only in 2.4.19rc1aa1: 90_init-survive-threaded-race-3
Only in 2.4.19rc1aa2: 90_init-survive-threaded-race-4
	Fixed merging error, good spotting by by Sami Farin.
Only in 2.4.19rc1aa1: 93_NUMAQ-3
Only in 2.4.19rc1aa2: 93_NUMAQ-4
	Rediffed.
Only in 2.4.19rc1aa1: 94_numaq-tsc-2
Only in 2.4.19rc1aa2: 94_numaq-tsc-3
	s/==/=/. Apparently menuconfig understand the C like "==" syntax too,
	because it worked as expected until somebody tried xconfig.  Fix from
	J.A. Magallon. (I use menuconfig so I could hardly notice it :)
