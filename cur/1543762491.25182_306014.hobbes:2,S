ksymoops seems to remove lines from the kernel output that it doesn't
like.  I've seen this many times on ARM, and each time I see an oops
from a 2.6 kernel which has been ksymoopsed, I always ask the submitter
to send the original non-ksymoopsed version.
Users need to be re-educated _not_ to use ksymoops.
