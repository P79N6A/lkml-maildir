I started doing similar a while back, and I hadn't come across any
actual bugs either.  However, there's 2 aspects to this:
1) The cleanup cases that Jesper is doing (which are pretty similar
to what I was doing) are mostly "function prototypes in .h files use
a variable name that collides with another global variable" ('up' for
example). (My nominee for patch 10/9:
include/net/tcp.h:469: warning: declaration of '__x' shadows a previous local
include/net/tcp.h:469: warning: shadowed declaration is here
2) The actual *bugs* are most probably in the "variable in .c file
shadows a global".
As Jesper notes, it's hard to see the latter when there's 38,000+ noise
warnings....
To get a good estimate of the *actual* bug rate, grep for how many *.c files
trigger the warning when built with -Wshadow - there's 695 of *those* in
my current config.
When I did a bunch of cleanups a while ago to make -Wundef work, I think
I scared up exactly one actual bug - but it was a subtle one in the NFS
code that wouldn't have been easu to find otherwise...
