I have some suspicions on what could be causing this.
The most obvious suspect is get_scan_ratio() continuing to return
100 file reclaim, 0 anon reclaim when the file LRUs have already
been reduced to something very small, because reclaiming up to that
point was easy.
I plan to add some code to automatically set the anon reclaim to
100% if (free + file_active + file_inactive <= zone->pages_high),
meaning that reclaiming just file pages will not be able to free
enough pages.
