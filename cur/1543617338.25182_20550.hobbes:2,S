Giacomo will probably answer definitively, but I believe he is already
generating all of the PCI, PNP, and module probes by script.  We're planning
to ship the probe table generator with a future CML2 version.

Which is why the "standalone" mode of the autoconfigurator turns all that
stuff modular.  The autoprobe doesn't, it's intended to generate a facilities
report that can be used to tune by hand.
