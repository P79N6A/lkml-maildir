i've been thinking about it on and off. If you would/could try it that
would certainly help. RT for Linux is a dance of many small steps.
the two projects are obviously complementary and i have no intention to
reinvent the wheel in any way. Best would be to bring hires timers up to
upstream-mergable state (independently of the -RT patch) and ask Andrew
to include it in -mm, then i'd port -RT to it automatically.
