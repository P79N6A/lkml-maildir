I concur with Paul. I had to delete the message I was composing because
it said exactly the same thing.
I do think that we need to put some thought into what a secid
really is and what a secctx ought to look like what with multiple
user cropping up for them. To date audit is the only out-of-LSM
user of the secctx, and assumes it's a printable text string, but
if cacheing is going to be using it as well we're approaching the
secctx being a "general" interface, and hence a part of the LSM
proper. Probably makes sense to include something in the LSM
documentation. With luck, someone who spells better than I will
beat me to it, but such an update is on my todo list.
