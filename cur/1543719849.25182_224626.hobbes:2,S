Subject: [PATCH] get_user_pages vs. try_to_unmap
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Andrea Arcangeli's fix to an ironic weakness with get_user_pages.
try_to_unmap_one must check page_count against page->mapcount before
unmapping a swapcache page: because the raised pagecount by which
get_user_pages ensures the page cannot be freed, will cause any write
fault to see that page as not exclusively owned, and therefore a copy
page will be substituted for it - the reverse of what's intended.
rmap.c was entirely free of such page_count heuristics before, I tried
hard to avoid putting this in.  But Andrea's fix rarely gives a false
positive; and although it might be nicer to change exclusive_swap_page
etc. to rely on page->mapcount instead, it seems likely that we'll want
to get rid of page->mapcount later, so better not to entrench its use.
