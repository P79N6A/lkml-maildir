In my opinion, the code structure is different between both functions. In
tcp_recvmsg(), we test for it if (copied > 0), where copied is the sum of
all data which have been processed since the entry in the function. If we
removed the test here, we could not break out of the loop once we have
copied something. In tcp_splice_read(), the test is still present in the
(!ret) code path, where ret is the last number of bytes processed, so the
test is still performed regardless of what has been previously transferred.
So in summary, in tcp_splice_read without this test, we get back to the
top of the loop, and if __tcp_splice_read() returns 0, then we break out
of the loop.
I don't know if my explanation is clear or not, it's easier to follow the
loops in front of the code :-/
