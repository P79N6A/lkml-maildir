As far as I'm concerned, these falls in the "curiosity" category, not
the "brown paper bag" category, but...
 1. If I compile a 2.2.0-pre9 kernel with "make bzImage", the
    resulting kernel does NOT boot up on my Toshiba laptop - it just
    reports "Out of memory, system halted". Compiling a 2.0.36 kernel
    with "make bzImage" results in one that DOES boot up, and runs
    quite happily...
    I will add that BOTH of these kernels boot quite happily on my
    desktop system and, in addition, 2.2.0-pre9 compiled with "make
    zImage" (once I got enough stripped out for that to work) boots
    fine on the said laptop, so this looks like whatever the bug is,
    it's in the bzImage routines...
    In case it helps, the laptop is a Toshiba T2110 (i486dx4/75, 12M
    RAM, 800M Hard drive, PCMCIA NE2000 network adapter) with RedHat
    5.2 NFS-installed direct from the SunSITE-UK mirror site, and
    nothing other than the kernel upgraded. Compilation was done on
    my desktop system, a P166 with 128M of RAM and 6.4G of hard drive
    space, and running RedHat 5.1, but with "make menuconfig" set for
    the relevant options for the notebook...
 2. I gather that the "NFS server support" option (which results in
    the creation of the nfsd.o module) is only expected to work if
    the knfsd userland daemon is currently running? Otherwise, it
    reports an "undefined symbol" error.
 3. I gather that "The IPX protocol" is also only intended to work
    with some userland daemon for the same reason?
 4. Finally, I note that "modprobe ipv6" produces 73 different
    "undefined symbol" errors, so make a similar assumption...
Best wishes from Riley.
