The aim is to be able to recover from a memory parity error in the NIC.
Such errors happen sometimes, especially when a cosmic ray comes by. To
recover, we restore the state that we saved at the end of the
initialization. As saving currently disables MSI, we currently have to
restore the state right after saving it at the end of the initialization
(see the end of
myri10ge_probe in 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/23/24
).
I just tried, the patch fixes our problem (no need to restore right
after saving to reenable MSI).
