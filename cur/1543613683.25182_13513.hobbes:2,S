That's a big function, unfortunately.   Could you please
do the following?
In the top-level makefile, add the line:
CFLAGS += -g
right at the end.    Then rebuild the kernel, recreate the
crash, then run:
gdb vmlinux
(gdb) l *0xc0264050
(Assuming that this is still the NIP address after you've rebuilt).
This should point us at the source code where the problem is
occurring.
Thanks.
