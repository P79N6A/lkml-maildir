The problem the diff below fixes is a BIOS issue - the _STA control method
should always be returning a value, but in this case it doesn't. The
approach we're taking is "get everything working and THEN worry about broken
ACPI implementations" and hopefully in the meantime, people will release
fixed BIOSs ;-).

This is a temporary interface, just to see if we're returning values
properly. Your points below are well taken. People really care about
minutes/percentage remaining. In your opinion should we just report that
through /proc or should we keep the data low-level like it is now, and have
a user app do the math, or what?

*info corresponds with the _BIF control method, and *status with _BST. I
thought _BIF stuff is static - is it not?
