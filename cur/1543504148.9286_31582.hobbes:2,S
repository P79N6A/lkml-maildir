Group,
        I started a private thread and figured that I could
        take it back to the beginning and see what the
        community "thinks" of this.
        Reference : The Magic Garden Explained : page 249 - 252.
        The Internals of UNIX System V Release 4
        An Open Systems Design
        Simply, this is a System V Release 4 (SVR4) type of struct
        and would this idea be good to impliment within Linux?
        Are there other SVR4.0 items in missing in Linux that should
        be coded within Linux? The logic behind this idea is why
        re-invent the wheel, when a perfectly good one exists?
        And before I get flamed, I do need a tan :), I am not
        proposing this change, I am just curious what others think.
