Hi All,
It is not possible anymore from dos with loadlin and from a floppy which
contains a kernel image written with dd, It used to work for some years.
My system is arch i386. gcc-3.2 glibc-3.2.1
What happens is:
Uncompressing Linux ...
ran out of input data
  --System halted  
Any clues?
-- 
Groeten / Regards, Rene J. Blokland
