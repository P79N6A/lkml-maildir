This patch doesn't really look bad at all, but...
I am worried that what might seem nice and clean right now will slowly
get worse.  This implements an interface on top of another interface
(char device on top of a filesystem).  What is the next hugetlbfs
function that will need a boolean switch to handle a character device
special case?
Am I just worrying too much here?  Although my pagetable_operations
patches aren't the most popular right now, they do have at least one
advantage IMO: they enable side-by-side implementation of the interfaces
as opposed to stacking them.  Keeping them separate removes the need for
if ((vm_flags & VM_HUGETLB) && (is_hugetlbfs_chardev())) checking.
