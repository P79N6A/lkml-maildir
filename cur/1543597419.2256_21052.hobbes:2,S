This is like what the hard drive and BIOS industry has been doing.
First we had the 528 MB limit. Then the 2 GB limit. Then the 4 GB limit.
Then the 8.3 GB limit. Then the 33 GB limit. Then the 127 GB limit.
All along the way, users are cursing the damn limits.
An extra 4 bits buys us 6 years maybe. Nice, except that we
already have people complaining. Maybe somebody remembers when
the complaining started.
