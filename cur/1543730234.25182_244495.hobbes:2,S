I don't think that is assumed anywhere.
The pkt_rbtree_find() function returns the first node with a sector
number >= s, even if there are multiple bios with bi_sector == s. Note
that the code branches to the left if s == tmp->bio->bi_sector.
The pkt_rbtree_insert() function is careful to insert a bio after any
already existing bios with the same sector number. Note that it
branches to the right if s == tmp->bio->bi_sector.
The tree rotations done internally in rbtree.c also can't mess things
up, because tree rotations don't change the inorder traversal order of
a tree.
