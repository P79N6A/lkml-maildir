Only when there are more instructions to execute. But device
driver code often does a following read e.g. to check if it can submit
another request to the hardware.
My claim is basically:
Change everybody who currently does
#ifdef CONFIG_MMIO
	writel(... )
	readl(...)
#else
	outl( ... ) 
	inl ( ...) 
#endif
to 
	if (dev->mmio) { 
		writel(); 
		real();
	} else { 
		outl();
		inl();
	} 
and you will have a hard time to benchmark the difference on any non ancient system
in actual driver operation.
