   I may get some time to work on this topic, but what do you mean by kill
   it ?
It means removing all of the "RFC1122 Status" comments from net/ipv4/*.c
   Is it the removal of RFC 1122 evaluation in modules' headers ? By
   the way, is RFC 1122 still accurate ?
It should be unless some later RFC specifies something which
supercedes a statement made in RFC1122, I believe there are not
many such cases if any.
Later,
