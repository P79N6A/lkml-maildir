In LinuxBIOS, We can allocate 64 bit region ( 0xfc0000000....) to the
mellanox Infiniband card. Some range above 4G.  So the mmio below 4G
is some smaller only 128M, Otherwise need 512M. If 4 IB cards are
used, the mmio will be 2G. For new opteron E stepping, We could use
hareware memhole support. But if the CPU is before opteron E, We only
can use SW mem mapping ( will lose some performance) or lose (2G RAM).
at such case We need 64bit pref mem. We only lose 128M even four IB
card are installed.
yesterday, someone add pci_restore_bars...., that will call
pci_update_resource, and it will overwirte upper 32 bit of BAR2 and
BAR4 of IB card.
So the patch make pci_restore_resource
1. don't touch BAR3, and BAR5, if BAR2, and BAR4 are 64 bit MEM IO
2. not assume BAR2 and BAR4 upper 32bit is 0 if if BAR2, and BAR4 are
64 bit MEM IO
