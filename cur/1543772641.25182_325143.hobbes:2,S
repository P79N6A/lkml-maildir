Linux does not always run on a $500+ PC. People also use Linux on
_embedded_ devices costing only a small fraction of a $500+ PC. But I do
agree it is kind of silly to use the OS for this example. 
Assuming you do not put any "highlevel" calculations in a IRQ handler,
the only usefull place to have fast IRQ handlers, as far as I can see,
without having fast preemption is with cheap hardware without a lot of 
buffering. 
I can come up with CAN controllers, which only have very little
bufferspace (because they are cheap as they are sold in large volumes).
Worst case you will have to empty it every 100-200 us or so to avoid
having an overrun and loosing packages. The interpretation of the packets
should ofcourse be deferred to a task. The tolerated latency of that task
ofcourse depend on what you want to use the data for....
