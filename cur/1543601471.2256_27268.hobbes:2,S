The real question is why can't we just open 2.5 and only fix the VM to
start with?  Leave the kernel at 2.4.10-pre10, and possibly use the -ac
VM code (which has diverged from mainline), and leave people (Alan, Ben,
Marcello, et. al.) who want to tinker with it in small increments and
do the drastic stuff in 2.5.
Make it clear that 2.5 is still ONLY for VM and other bug fixes at this
point, and not all of the long-awaited 2.5 rework YET.  If it turns
out that the VM fixes are done quickly, then they can be back-ported
to 2.4.  If it takes longer than expected you can open 2.5 up to general
development.
With the right "management" it will be not much different than the current
situation, except that people won't have fits about such huge changes
going into 2.4.  I think this is your subconcious telling you that you
really wanted to start 2.5 a month ago.
Cheers, Andreas
