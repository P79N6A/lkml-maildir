There may be several ways to 'fix' this.  Perhaps it would be worth 
discussing what
we want the end result to be at least?
Should we always pass the vlan header up to raw sockets as part of the
data payload?
Or, maybe pass it in an auxiliary message such as how timestamps may be 
passed?
The first option seems cleaner, but maybe there are performance problems 
with this
approach?
We should also define what a NIC should do with VLANs it doesn't 
explicitly know
about.   I think it should pass them up the stack with VLAN tag intact, 
but again, perhaps
there are reasons not to do that?
DaveM did the HW Accel for VLANs if I remember correctly...perhaps he 
has some input?
Thanks,
Ben
