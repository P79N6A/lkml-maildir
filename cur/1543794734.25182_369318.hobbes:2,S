They are not the only ones doing closed source Linux drivers by far.
They just seem to be the most "visible" these days.  It's the other
companies, the ones that know better (or at least have legal departments
that know better) that are doing this for various different/odd hardware
pieces that are the most upsetting to me.
And yes, I do understand the patent issue with the video players these
days.  But what about the hardware OEM companies like IBM and HP that
bundle those graphic adapters in their system, and go off and support
and maintain the systems, running Linux, for big-named customers.
That's a timebomb waiting to go off, as there is some real money behind
those contracts.  They are the people in the position to change things
today, yet they are not :(
We are the people to change things for tomorrow, and we are...
thanks,
