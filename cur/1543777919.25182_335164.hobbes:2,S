Hmm. While second_overflow() has been integrated into ntp_advance, we
are not actually running that code every tick. Instead we keep an
internal interval counter that runs the equivalent second_overflow()
code only once a second. Maybe I'm not understanding specifically which
you're talking about?

Well, with the exception of the last two patches, these changes should
just be cleanups. If you notice a change in behavior in the first 10
patches, please let me know.

In a sense that's what I'm trying to provide, the NTP state machine will
provide the adjustment that you can either apply completely at tick time
or continually w/ a timesource.
I really don't think the NTP changes I've mailed is very complex.
Please, be specific and point to something you think is an issue and
I'll do my best to fix it.

Again, I'm not be doing larger NTP state machine changes every tick.
Thanks again for the feedback, I really do appreciate the review.
thanks
