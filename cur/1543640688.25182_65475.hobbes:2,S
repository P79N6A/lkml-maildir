Hi everyone
I've come across a BUG() in buffer.c, line 2497. I'm running 2.4.19 on a 
Pentium III, with no other problems. I'd finished making a backup of an 
IRIX installation CD, was mounting the freshly burnt CD, and was greeted 
with a hung 'mount' and the following in dmesg:
EFS: 1.0a -

Line 2497 of buffer.c is in grow_buffers, and the code is as follows:
   2495:       /* Size must be multiple of hard sectorsize */
   2496:        if (size & (get_hardsect_size(dev)-1))
   2497:                BUG();
This is the first time its happened. Can anybody confirm that this is, 
as I suspect, a problem with the CD-ROM and not with the kernel? Do I 
need to provide any more information to help somebody with troubleshooting?
