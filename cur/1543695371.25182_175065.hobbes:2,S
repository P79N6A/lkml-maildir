Hi All,
I've recently setup a dual Opteron system on a Tyan 2880 (K8S
tested with both the most recent stable and beta bioses) and am
experiencing hard system hangs (the system is completely
inaccessible, no kernel oops, no logging, nothing on the
console) when my 3ware 8506 (8 port) card goes into heavy use.
In particular, a RAID resynch is a sure bet for calamity --
using _either_ software RAID5 or the hardware RAID5).
This happens consistently with a very up-to-date system (Debian
Unstable) and kernels 2.4.22, 2.4.23-pre7 and 2.6.0-test8-bk3.
Each of these kernels and all of the system binaries are 32bit
-- there are other issues in 64bit mode, but I'll save those
for later. I am using the most recent v7.6.4 3ware bios for the
card as well (although the same hangs occurred using the
earlier bios).
Note that the system seems to hang _only_ during heavy 3ware
usage.  Heavy CPU, memory, and/or disk thrashing when the 3ware
module is not loaded causes no problems.
Any ideas of things I can try in order to get more (i.e.
useful) information on the problem?
Scott
