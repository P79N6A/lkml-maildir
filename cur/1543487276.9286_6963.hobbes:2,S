Hi,
Does anyone know what the purpose of the GET_CURRENT() is in the code
block starting with ret_from_intr:? I looked at what I believe are all
possible entries into that code block, and in all cases, a GET_CURRENT
has already been done before, and I can't see how ebx would loose its
value. Am I missing something obvious?
Please CC me on the answer since I am not part of the mailing list.
Thanks for any input.
Kanoj
