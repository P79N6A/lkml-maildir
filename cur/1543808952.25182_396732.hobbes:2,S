Yes, this isn't a "regression" but has been there for a while.  It can
also only be triggered by a root user, so it's severity is much lower.

I have a patch for this, which will be going to Linus later tonight.

This has been the case for a long time.  I don't really think there is a
rush to get this fixed, but I really like James's proposed patch.  It's
up to him if he feels it is ready for 2.6.16 or not.

He never reported back, and one other person who reported this, figured
out that it was bad ram in the system.  Replacing that fixed the issue.
I've also printed a lot of stuff here (tax time...) and had no problems.

Fixed by the previously mentioned EHCI quirk/handoff patch that will be
going to Linus.
So, that's it for the USB stuff, thankfully.
