Hi,
Andre and I did indeed have a nice conversation on the phone. Thank you
again for taking the time to talk with me and offering your assistance. As I
stated on the phone, we are making a large commitment of resources to
supporting Linux by releasing drivers and utilities for our products,
including the FastTrak. I know we have plans to release source for our Ultra
and SuperTrak series cards, but at this point I'm not sure that the way we
are going to be supporting FastTrak is what you would like to see. As I
said, while I cannot guarantee anything that I don't have the authority to
deliver, I will pass on your requests. I will try to be an advocate for
Promise in the Linux community, and an advocate for the Linux community to
Promise. If the company has concerns, I will let you know what they are, and
then maybe you can tell us if we are off-base with those concerns or not.
I would invite anybody to contact me if you have any suggestions, any
requests, whatever. As I told Andre, I won't promise something I can't
personally deliver, but I will do whatever I can to help out. I'm also
trying to get a technical point of contact so that you don't have to deal
with a marketing weenie who doesn't understand half of what you're saying
;).
Regards,
Craig

Greetings Craig,
I would like to publicly thank you for coming to the table of GNU/GPL with
an open perspective.  After 90 minutes on the phone, of which 45 minutes
were me pointing out issues promblems and complaints w/ 20 minutes on ways
to work on solutions in the near and distant future and the listening to
your concerns and questions between my moments of interruption.
The next conversion will not have the burst-in moments because it will be
in person or my cell battery will be fully charged.
Since you have stated "I will not make promise, I can not keep" this is a
good thing and it will go a fair way to clean up messes from the past on
both sides.
I look forward to Promise working with Linux in meaningful and productive
ways.
Please reply and correct anything that is mistated by me or verify the
correctness.  This will show an action of good-faith before all those
watching here.
Respectfully,
Andre Hedrick
Linux ATA Development
