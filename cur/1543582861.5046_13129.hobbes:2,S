Subject: Buglet: Mount iso-9660 always have exec bit set (755)

	For a while I'm annoyed by a buglet:
When trying to mount an ordinary CD like (as root):
mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom -o ro,noexec
it works, but all files have the execute attribute set for all users,
and that is annoying in 
MidnightCommander and other filemanagers that try execute the file as a
program instead of opening it based on file asociation set.
Mount version is: mount-2.10o 
kernel2.4.1ac10 but see the same behaviour on all 2.4.x kernels.
	Is that something that I miss or is a small buglet in mounting isofs
???
		Thank you 
		Mircea C.
P.S: That problem didn't arise when using 2.2.x.
