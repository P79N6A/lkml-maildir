I got a cheap Digi Acceleport C2 card - and according to the box it
should support up to 460 Kbp because of it's 16C650 uarts. Web searches
regarding these uarts have shown up one source in linux-68k. Does
anybody know anything about this in 'normal' Linux? I don't even know
the meaning of the dip-switches, since I got no documentation but the
box, and Digi says it's a Legacy product - no support.
Any tips would be appreciated,
Jurriaan
