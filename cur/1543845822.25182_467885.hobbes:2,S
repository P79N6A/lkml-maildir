Yes, that is the question. The whole invocation path is
sys_settimeofday() -> do_sys_settimeofday()
I do not find a lock embracing do_sys_settimeofday().
Moreover, seems neither write operations nor read operations on sys_tz
is protected by any locks, in sys_gettimeofday() and
sys_settimeofday() respectively.
