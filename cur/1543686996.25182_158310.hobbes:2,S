Hi,
I've written a file that provides wrappers for kernel mode file operations (using existing filp_xx and supporting operations).
This provides support for opening/closing/reading/writing/seeking/formatting etc operations. This should help kernel mode developers with fs operations in their kernel drivers/modules.
It helps simplify kernel mode file operations and takes care of various issues (which one can forget at times) like handling the FS registers , uid and gid. It exposes kernel mode file operations in a way that are very similar to user mode operations like fopen, fclose, fseek etc.
I have tested it on a few systems and it appears to be working great.
Hope this finds it's way into the linux kernel :)
Ramit.
