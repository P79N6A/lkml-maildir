There is one kernel stack for every user process, and it is mapped in
kernel memory (above PAGE_OFFSET).  Note that even in an interrupt
context, the kernel stack of whatever user process was running is used.
> 2- Which is the size of the kernel stack ??
It is fixed at 8k - sizeof (struct task_struct).  This is the reason
recursion in the kernel should be avoided.

No.  Normally when in user mode the kernel stack should be empty.
