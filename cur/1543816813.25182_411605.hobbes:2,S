It doesn't matter.  The proof that Xen has more overhead is trivial
Xen does more, and Xen clients don't share resources well.
Nor is this about Xen vs what we are doing.  These are different
non conflicting approaches that operating in completely different
ways and solve a different set of problems.
Xen is about multiple kernels.
The alternative is a supped of chroot.
