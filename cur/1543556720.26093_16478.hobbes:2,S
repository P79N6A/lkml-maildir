Hi,
How about TSC? I know this has disadvantages such as:
a) not all machines have TSC
b) not all machines that claim to have TSC have a usable one.
c) on SMP the kernel makes a best effort to synchronize TSC but this may
or may not be guaranteed
d) you still need a userspace implementation to correctly map TSC cycles
to (micro)seconds using various MHz-specific ratios/whatever. I think
someone I know has already done this work but will let him speak if he
wants to release this to public or not.
other than the above, TSC (rdtsc instruction) is perfectly available to
userspace applications without special privileges. And it is 64bit so it
won't easily wrap around...
regards,
Tigran.
