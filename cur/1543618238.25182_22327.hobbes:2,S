I think he is referring to software RAID. And yes, it is indeed a problem
that the RedHat installer cannot create nested RAIDs (at least, I too was
unable to do that, so either it's impossible, or I'm equally blind).

Also, GRUB/LILO only support booting from RAID-1 (or no RAID).

Yes it does.  If you have persistent superblocks on all arrays, they
*should* autostart.
If you boot from the 4G disk, does the array start properly ?  Does
it start properly even if you remove your /etc/raidtab ?
Please check that you have the correct RAID levels either compiled
into your kernel, or on an initrd.

A performance improvement went into 2.4 at some stage - all newer 2.4 kernels
will schedule reads to the mirror which has it's head nearest to where the
read should occur.  This works very well in my experience.
