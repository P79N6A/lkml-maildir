Not unusual, as I said, its done in a ton of net drivers.
That said, I suppose its OK to do
	#define ata_msg_foo() 0
for wacky embedded situations.  But the default will be enabled for all 
users, not just debug kernels.

Not useless at all:  It documents the model that is being implemented 
quite well.  libata will use the same method of bitmasks, same method of 
increasing verbosity as set by debug level, same method of masking the 
more verbose messages by default, but always compiling the messages into 
the driver.  Its highly similar.
