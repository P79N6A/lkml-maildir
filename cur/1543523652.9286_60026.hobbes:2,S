Hi,
i try to compile 2.3.40 on a Sgi 320 bi-processor pII 450 (probably the
first type of this workstation).
I receive errors for sgi configuration that, as i see, has problem with
sgi_apic. This isn't true with generic_apic for pc.
I think that sgi code isn't recently. It's true?
Someone work on the tuning of Linux over Sgi Intel-based workstation?
Let's me know about. Thank.
Daniele Medri
