It's hardly a "crippled" clock chip. It's just the way it was
designed.  Crippled implies that it was previously better.
The year goes from 00 to 99 in BCD (currently) although, if you
muck up everything you can set it to 0 to 255 in binary
but you have to rewrite the BIOS <grin>...
Also, the century byte is in BCD too. That makes the end of
the world as we know it on 9999 some 7,996 years from now.
Before then, the MC146818A chip emulation will be replaced
with a 16,384-bit virtual device so don't worry.
Cheers,
