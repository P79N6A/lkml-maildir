Subject: [ANNOUNCE] New high resolution time patch for 2.6.5 kernel

The High Resolution Timers patch for the 2.6.5 kernel has just been posted on 
sourceforge.
This patch provides an extension to the POSIX clocks and timers to define two 
new high resolution clocks (CLOCK_REALTIME_HR and CLOCK_MONOTONIC_HR).  The 
resolution of these clocks can be set at CONFIGURE time, with the default being 
10 micro seconds.  The high res clocks can be used with clock_nanosleep() as 
well as with the POSIX timers.
This version uses apic timers to obtain much better accuracy and simplicity.
