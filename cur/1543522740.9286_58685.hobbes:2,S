You could use NeTraMet (Network Traffic Meter) which is a mature user
mode solution that uses libpcap to snoop traffic and record traffic
summariess using a simple packet matching rule language. You could
easily configure it to record a summary of traffic on gateway's interior
interface between say <internal RFC1918 address> and <public addresses>
aggregated by internal address.

The software scales up to OC3 speed realtime traffic accounting and can
even listen to NetFlow accounting records from a CISCO router
(NetFlowMet). I use it at an ISP environment for doing destination based
(global/national/local) traffic reporting per network.
