It is most likely caused by nfs neglecting to drop a lock when it exits
- it is not a problem.  The error message is there to catch cases where
a task's preempt_count (consider it a task's eligibility to be
preempted) is nonzero when it exists.  It should always be zero.
In this case it is probably harmless since the count isn't off until the
task exits.  This test may not be worth it with these false positives...
