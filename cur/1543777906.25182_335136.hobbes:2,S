As Kerin pointed out, gcc 4.0 supports auto-vectorization, so in
theory, these options might provide better performance on some
compilers. Apparently SSE is not enabled by default any more for P4
because of a known bug w/ some compilers. People using gcc > 4.0 can
obviously override it.
Really, w/out the presence of auto-vectorization support in the
compiler none of the vector extensions are necessary. The only things
that really matter are -mcpu and -mtune: what instruction set your CPU
supports and the optimum instruction scheduling characteristics for
your CPU, respectively.
