Subject: [PATCH] ioremap_cached()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

We currently have three ways for getting access to device memory --
ioremap(), ioremap_nocache() and pci_iomap().  99% of the callers of
ioremap() are doing it to access device registers, and really, really
want to use ioremap_nocache() instead.  I presume nobody notices on PCs
because they have write-through caches, but it ought to trip up people
trying to flush writes.
pci_iomap() gets this right -- it calls ioremap() if the resource is
tagged with IORESOURCE_CACHEABLE and ioremap_nocache() if it isn't.
Unfortunately, the only resources tagged with IORESOURCE_CACHEABLE
are PCI ROM resources, so even frame buffers and similar that could be
cached aren't.
It seems clear to me that ioremap() and ioremap_nocache() are the
wrong way around.  The default needs to be uncached -- and the obvious
(rare) alternative becomes ioremap_cached().
So here's a patch for i386 to add ioremap_cached() and make ioremap()
uncached.  ioremap_nocache() remains as an alias for ioremap() so we
don't needlessly break old drivers.  Architecture maintainers will need
to fix up their ports if this patch is accepted.
