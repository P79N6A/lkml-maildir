Good. I'll push it out for review then.

No, too magic. I dislike adding knobs to workaround issues that
really should be fixed by having sane default behaviour.  Further
down the track as we correct know issues with the AIL push code
we'll be able to increase this idle timeout or even make it purely
wakeup driven once we get back to an idle state. However, right now
it still needs that once a second wakeup to work around a nasty
corner case that can hang the filesystem....
Cheers,
Dave.
