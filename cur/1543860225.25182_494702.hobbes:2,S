After being up for ten days, I have now encountered the file
corruption of pkgcache.bin for the first time again. The 256 MB i386
box is like 26M in swap, is under very moderate load.
I am running plain vanilla 2.6.19.1. Is there a patch that I should
apply against 2.6.19.1 that would help in debugging?
Greetings
Marc
