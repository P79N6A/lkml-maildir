Then properly initialize the thing.

Again, don't test an explicit enumerated type against "0", that's just
foolish.  Why have the explicit type if you are going to do that?  Does
sparse complain about it?  It should if it doesn't...

Initialize the state in the probe.  Then check against the enumerated
type, not an integer value.  Sparse should complain if you try to do
that.
Or, if you really want to test against integers, rip out those types,
otherwise they are useless as you keep trying to go around them...
