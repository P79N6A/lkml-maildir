But they are not required for that :-)
I would suggest to use an irq-safe spinlock for the hardware access
and a status indicator (ready for command), if this is really just a command register. 
If the status indicator is updated (in IRQ) and read under spinlock, that is safe.
If that command sending is speed critical, please try a FIFO and batch that stuff.
Timeout based locking mechanisms are flawed, because they introduce the hard to find
timing sensitive bugs.
Please try sth. different (e.g. like suggested above).
Semaphores aren't good "busy/ready flags", as you might have already noticed.
Many Thanks and Best Regards
Ingo Oeser, the down{_interruptible,}_timeout() implementation of Linux :-)
