Gotos aren't the root of code evil.  Poor design style is and poor 
preparation is the root of spaghetti code.  Use the right tool for the 
job which includes 'goto'.  Every teacher that I've met who has an 
objection to the use of gotos has been quite naive, often recommends 
avoiding pointers, frequently suggests you restrict your strings to 255 
characters or less, etc, etc.  The oddball extras vary from teacher to 
teacher, but the overall impression of the teacher makes me want to 
avoid them even with that 10 foot pole.
It's not the fault of the student for being taught wrong, but it is the 
fault of the student for ignoring possibile variances of others.  
Particularly the "worldly wise"; people who actually write code for the 
real world v.s. lectures.
