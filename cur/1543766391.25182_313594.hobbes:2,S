Subject: [PATCH] FUSE: nfsd with direct_io fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch fixes an Oops which happens when a filesystem mounted with
the "direct_io" mount option is exported through NFS.  The problem is
that nfsd passes a kernel buffer with the "set_fs(KERNEL_DS)" method
to read and write, but get_user_pages() won't work on such a buffer.
The current fix is "don't do that then".  Long term solution will be
to implement nfs serving in userspace.  Bug spotted by David Shaw.
