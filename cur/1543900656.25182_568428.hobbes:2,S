i think this breaks PPC (which has no asm-offsets.h file). In any case i 
saw this build breakage too and the fix is in -rt2.

ok. Make sure you check rt2 as well - and note that it's not fully 
bisectable with PREEMPT_RT enabled (but should probably be fully 
bisectable with PREEMPT_RT disabled). So check out first whether the 
problem still persists with PREEMPT_RT disabled.
