A Cautionary Tale for Silly People
----------------------------------
For the past year now, I've had "ping" problems.
It pauses when it runs, and always returns warnings like so:
"Warning: time of day goes back, taking countermeasures"
I looked _everywhere_ on the net trying to find the problem.
I upgraded the kernel many times.
I upgraded glibc a few times.
I upgraded iputils a few times as well.
Nothing helped.
The clock was sync'd with an atomic clock every night.
Still, I kept getting the problem.
Then while moving log files around today, I noticed that the clock 'second'
didn't move.  Weird.
So I ran this:
  
  while :
  do
    date "+%H:%M:%S"
  done
I got interesting results:
17:05:24
17:05:24
17:05:24
17:05:33
17:05:33
17:05:25
17:05:25
17:05:33
17:05:25
17:05:25
Nice huh!
 Why?  
I looked inside the box and found a Pentium II 400, and a Pentium II 450.
Oddly enough they run together as a 266.
