Good point, the questions already for the "Runs on Linux" (have not seen 
any answers to them yet):
* is all drivers going to be runnable for all series and if not, how is 
that going to show?
* do the logo mean "only guarantied with the latest version (in the 
serie)"? some sort of time stamp on the logo?
The reason for my "suggestion" is:
* is there no risk to scare off people not interested in Linux?
* more likely it would get help from other OS-users too.
* is this about open drivers or the OS? (possible idea is to not 
verbally say Linux but having Tux on the logo) (think there is to much 
focus on the OS, ex: have seen "run on all Windows versions" for 
IDE->SATA-converters).

True! I hope I did not do so by suggesting/writing this.

Thank you, for answering.

PS
Don't get me wrong! If I see a "Runs on Linux"-logo in the future, I 
will be thrilled. No doubt about that!
