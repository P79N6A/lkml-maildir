I believe that the various read and write system calls impose a 32 bit limit
on the size of the i/o request, so you may need to look at that too.
Increasing the size of b_size would address a bug which exists when trying
to read more than 4GB from a block device which is greater than 4GB in size.
Currently, that bug is masked because the maximum system call size is
arbitrarily limited.
    Thanx...
