hm, well.  I'd suggest that we do what makes most sense, rather than
warping things to try to obey the letter of posix.

Sure.  And it'd be a bit rude to return 128 from the read() but to only
have written to a few bytes of the user's memory.
otoh, only-writing-a-few-bytes will be usefully quicker than zapping the
whole 128b, particularly on small-cacheline CPUs.
