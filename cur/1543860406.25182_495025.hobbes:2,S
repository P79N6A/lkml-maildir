IMHO this kind of "magic side effect" is a misuse of sysfs. and would
make proper locking
impossible. How do you deal with the dangling reference to the
netconsole object?
f= open (... netconsole/port1/remove")
write(f, "", 1)
sleep(2)
write(f, "", 1) .... this probably would crash...
Maybe having a state variable/sysfs file so you could setup the port and
turn it on/off with write.

Please don't use dev_name, instead use a a symlink. You see if the
device is renamed,
the dev_name will be wrong, but the symlink to the net_device kobject
should be okay.
