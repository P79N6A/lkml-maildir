Actually, I used a separate temperature sensor to come up with proper values
for lm_sensors to read the CPU temperature on my A7V (ver 1.01). After
testing lowest and highest temperatures, this what I came up with:
  compute    temp2     28.2+((@-18)*2), ((@-28.2)/2)+18
I know it looks weird, but it makes the "sensors" value for CPU temperate
match (within .5 degrees C) across the entire range I can test (which is
from full load on a 1GHz Thunderbird down to idle and using the old "lvcool"
patch).
