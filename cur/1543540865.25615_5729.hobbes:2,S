Uhm, I disagree.  "Am I holding this lock" is always true on UP.  "Is
someone else holding this lock" is always false.  "Am I holding this lock"
also isn't the same as spin_is_locked on SMP since you want to look at
who's holding it when debugging is enabled.  Same goes for "Is someone
else holding this lock".

You're right.  But no-one actually cares about whether a lock is held -
they care about whether they're holding it or someone else is holding it
or no-one's holding it.
