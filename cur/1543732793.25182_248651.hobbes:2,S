I have never heard of a program called "udef".  Any pointers to it?  :)
If it's such a big mistake, then don't use it.  No one is forcing you
to.

It's not a daemon (although to make things a bit easier on itself, it
does provide one by default, but some distros don't use it.)  It just
creates device nodes when the kernel finds a new device, with a name
that you pick.  Which is something that an in-kernel devfs can not do.

Well, until you do that, baseless criticism and trolling like this will
be ignored.
