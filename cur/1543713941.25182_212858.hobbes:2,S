I guess using vm_private_data for nonlinear is not a problem because
we use list i_mmap_nonlinear for nonlinear vmas.
As you have found out vm_private_data is only used if vm_file != NULL
or VM_RESERVED or VM_DONTEXPAND is set. I think we can revert back to
i_mmap{_shared} list for such special cases and use prio_tree for
others. I maybe missing something. Please teach me.
If anonmm is merged then I plan to seriously consider removing that
8 extra bytes for prio_tree. If anon_vma is merged, then I can easily
point my finger at 12 more bytes added by anon_vma and be happy :)
I still think removing the 8 extra bytes used by prio_tree from
vm_area_struct is possible.

Yeap. If Andrew didn't write his rmap-test.c and Ingo didn't write his
test-mmap3.c, I wouldn't even have considered developing prio_tree.
