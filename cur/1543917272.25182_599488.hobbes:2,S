Hard to say. It didn't happen as long as I used -22, but it didn't
happen for a long time (since I run -rc6), and it is not reproducible.
What I did at this time is a:
	tar -cjf foo.tar.bz2 a-big-dir-with-more-than-800Mb
I retried it again with -rc6 and it succeeded. So hard to say.
Best wishes
Norbert
