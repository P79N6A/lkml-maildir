OK, let me respond to this (again...) from the perspective of cpus.
This should to some extend also cover Andrew's request as well as
Paul's earlier message.
I see cpumem sets to be orthogonal to CKRM cpu share allocations.
AGAIN.
I see cpumem sets to be orthogonal to CKRM cpu share allocations.
In its essense, "cpumem sets" is a hierarchical mechanism of sucessively 
tighter constraints on the affinity mask of tasks.
The O(1) scheduler today does not know about cpumem sets. It operates
on the level of affinity masks to adhere to the constraints specified 
based on cpu masks.
The CKRM cpu scheduler also adheres to affinity mask constraints and 
frankly does not care how they are set.
So I do not see what at the scheduler level the problem will be.
If you want system isolation you deploy cpumem sets. If you want overall 
  share enforcement you choose ckrm classes.
In addition you can use both with the understanding that cpumem sets can 
and will not be violated even if that means that shares are not maintained.
Since you want orthogonality, cpumem sets could be implemented as a
different "classtype". They would not belong to the taskclass and thus 
are independent from what we consider the task class.
The tricky stuff comes in from the fact that CKRM assumes a system wide 
definition of a class and a system wide "calculation" of shares.

Alternatively to what is described above, if you want to do cpumemsets 
purely through the current implementation, I'd approach it as follows:
- Start with the current cpumemset implementation.
- Write the CKRM controller that simply replaces the API of the
   cpumemset.
- Now you have the object hierarchy through /rcfs/taskclass
- Change the memsets through the generic attributes (discussed in
   earlier emails to extend the static fixed shares notation)
- DO NOT USE CPU shares (always specify DONTCARE).
I am not saying that this is the most elegant solution, but neither
is trying to achieve proportional shares through cpumemsets.
