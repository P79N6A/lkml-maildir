Not much progress so far?

| Sorry, no pointers.  See if you can find a linux-usb-devel or
| linux-usb-users archive.  You're searching for something that introduces a
| "delay" (good keyword) in the boot process.
There have been 2 such patches that I know of.
a. One is from Eric Lammerts (subj: Using USB floppy drive for root floppy)
on Dec. 23, 2001 (on the linux-kernel mailing list).
<http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=100912381726661&w=2>
b. 2001-10-26: Booting a USB disk:
<http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-usb-users&m=100408963708374&w=2>
Neither of these patches will apply cleanly to 2.4.1[89].
I am working with 'a.'.
It now applies and builds cleanly, so I'm trying to test it.
My turn for a question:
What files do I need to copy to a USB boot disk to be able to
successfully boot a Linux kenrel?
I'm already building the kernel with usb-storage support and all of
the required SCSI support in the kernel.
Won't I need to put the kernel as the primary boot image,
i.e., don't use a boot loader on the USB storage device,
since the boot loader won't have USB storage I/O capabilities?
Does anyone know of a HOWTO for this?
I'm currently trying to use the zip-install and/or install-from-zip
mini-howtos.
