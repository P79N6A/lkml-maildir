Or "choose not to use".  One does not say, "eschew that bear."

And the whole thing ("eschew obfuscation") is a stock expression in
English, meaning "don't use unfamiliar words when familiar words will
express what you mean."  There's an implied self-reference:  "eschew
obfuscation" is a very obscure way of saying "keep it simple".  It's
mildly funny.
