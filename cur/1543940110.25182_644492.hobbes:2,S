Oh, I think I've gotten what misleads you.
The .kprobes.text section is a KPROBES-FREE zone. There may be
breakpoints owned by other debuggers and hand-coded breakpoints
(like as jprobe_return).

IMO, one of advantages of current logic is that you can add another break_handler-based
probe as an module without any patches. Even if someone makes fooprobe which is
not a jprobe variant, current logic can treat it correctly.
(Another advantage is the performance. Current logic checks only if there is a
 running kprobe and there is no kprobes related to the trapped address, instead of
 checking address section every time when each breakpoint is hit.)

Yes, I mentioned it above.

They cannot lie kprobes in the .kprobes.text section, but can put
breakpoints by hand. this is the reason why kprobes provides break_handler.
Thanks,
