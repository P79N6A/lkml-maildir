I am doing all this at home on a personal level, so I am somewhat restricted. 
My normal CDRW machine is an Athlon 2100+ running on an Elite K7S5A 
motherboard.
I have a server running Celeron 1.7G and PlatiniX (Intel 845 Chipset) 
motherboard.  I moved the CDRW over to it and tried it. I didn't have time to 
build a special version of the system for it, and its running debian sarge 
with 2.6.8.1.  It failed to work, the symptoms were similar but slightly 
different.
