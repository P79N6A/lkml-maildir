Yeah. The driver did something very odd (I suspect it of wrapping around
below 0 when maintaining byte-counters for devices) when operating on
low-bandwidth links. It worked quite well if you had more than 64K of
bandwidth, but became marginal and starvation prone at lower
rates...also, if you had modem error correction enabled it's values were
wrong in the event of a line hit.
I eventually hacked the code to do round-robin scheduling to try to even
things out. Not perfect, but good enough.
