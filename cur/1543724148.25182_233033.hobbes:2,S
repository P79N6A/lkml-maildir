Yes - I would. If you can define a digestible framework for testing then I
would be more than happy to work through it - digestible for mere mortals,
that is ;). I have three machines on which I currently have the
opportunity to conduct such tests:
* PIII (733MHz), 384Mb RAM, VIA Apollo MVP3 chipset
* Compaq Presario, P4 2GHz, 256Mb RAM, Brookdale-G chipset
* Compaq Proliant ML370 G3 server, P4 Xeon 3.06GHz (HT), 1Gb RAM
All machines have similar software characteristics - identical toolchain,
same versions of core GNU tools and so forth. By all means, let me know if
there is anything I can do to help.
