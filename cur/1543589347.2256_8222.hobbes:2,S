Oops just a typo, it should be <= 5. The patch is correct.

I've learned it the hard way, I have two types : Compaq DL360 (rev 5) and a
Tyan S2510 (rev 6). On the compaq machine I constantly get data corruption on
the last double word (4 bytes) in a 64 byte PCI burst when I use write
combining on the CPU. On the Tyan however the transfer is always ok.
