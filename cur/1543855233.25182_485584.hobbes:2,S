It's quite possible to have:
IRQ	chip
0	irqchip_0
1	irqchip_0
2	irqchip_1
3	irqchip_0
4	irqchip_0
5	irqchip_1
6	irqchip_2
7	irqchip_2
8	irqchip_2
9	irqchip_1
Where do you start '0' for each irqchip?  How do you split the irq_desc
array between the irqchips?
(and yes there are platforms merged which do this.)
