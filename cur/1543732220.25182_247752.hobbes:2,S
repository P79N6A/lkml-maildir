Ok.  However, I'm still wondering at the scrolling speed, it's a bit slower
than what I would expect (I get < 1 second with vesafb which is completely
unaccelerated).  
Did you set info->flags = FBINFO_DEFAULT | FBINFO_HWACCEL_YPAN?
Do you use the 'nopan' boot option?   
Because if you answer yes to the first question and no to the second, that
means that tdfxfb_pan_display() is probably broken.
BTW, what does fbset -i say, and what's your hardware setup?

tdfxfb_cursor() is broken, so I disabled that.  It's the reason your machine
hangs at boot time if CONFIG_FB_3DFX_ACCEL is set to y.
