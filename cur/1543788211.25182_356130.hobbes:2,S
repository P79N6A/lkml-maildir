You're confusing concepts. In Unix unlinking a file is not the same as 
deleting it. As has already been said, to remove content from a file, 
you truncate it, which, no surprise, requires that you have write 
access to a file. Even in DOS deleting a file, unless you use a 
secure delete program, doesn't delete the file - it merely changes 
the name slightly and marks the chain of FAT cluster entries as 
usable. 
I've had the displeasure of having to fix a netware system that had 
been so fsked up by an admin that had been fired that it was easier 
for me to remove the volume and restore it from a backup. The problem 
was that he made a large number of files with the administrative 
account removed from the ACL's... And the same problem plagues 
(plagued? I haven't checked up on this in a while) NTFS. It is all to 
possible to create a bunch of files with "Administrator" and all 
other "Administrator" class users form the ACL's and then kill that 
user.

So provide a filesystem and a set of tools for that filesystem. Nobody 
is standing in your way and the Linux filesystem and block device 
layers are open enough that this is an easy (though not simple) task.

Oh, so that explains it. You got used to one paradigm and haven't been 
able to adjust to another. Well, as I have previously said, go ahead 
and provide us with the work.

Time to fix Unix? I doubt something seriously borked would have 
outlasted every other OS on the market. Unix was around before 
Netware and, IMHO, will be around a long time after the last 
adherents of NetWare are gone. (and with MS doing it's level best to 
kill NetWare with it's own shared filesystems and built-in networking 
this cannot be that far off. After all, Netware was developed to fill 
a vacancy in the MS world.)
