My measurements of factors of 3-4 on more than one hw arch don't
mean anything then? BTW: Ingo Molnar has a response that did find 
my comp.arch posts. As I indicated to him, I've done a lot of code
tuning to get better performance even in the presence of tlb issues.
This factor is what is left. Starting from an untuned code, the factor
can be up to an order of magnitude larger. As in 30-60. Yes, I've
measured that too, though these detailed measurments were only on
mips/origins.
It is true that I have never had the opportunity to test these
issues on x86 and its relatives. Perhaps it would be better there.
The relative insensitivity of the results I have already to hw 
arch, indicate otherwise though.
Re maintainability: Fine. I like maintainable code too. Coding
standards are great. Language standards are even better.
These are motherhood statements. Your simple rejections
("NO, HELL NO!!") even of any attempts to make these sorts
of improvements seems to make that issue pretty moot anyway.
