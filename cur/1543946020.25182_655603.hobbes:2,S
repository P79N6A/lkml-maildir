The intention is the latter.  I hope to help people sort out some of the
conflicts and cross subsystem issues before we get into the merge window
and the code gets into Linus' tree.
Andrew Morton also hopes that the linux-next tree may get more testing
that the -mm tree did if we can stop it having to many regressions by
only including the less experimental code that is destined for the next
kernel release.
