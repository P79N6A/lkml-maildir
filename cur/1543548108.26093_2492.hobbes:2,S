Well, what I'm trying to do is raise the issue.  If it seems like I'm
trying to make it overly important there's probably some miscommunication
going on.

I think I understand the design focus as well.  Like you said a bit later
its focused on creating a very solid underlying structure.  Maybe you're
right that in the long-run Linux will win the race by having the solid
structure with all the features layered properly on top of it.  OTOH if
Linux doesn't deliver the features soon, perhaps interest will go
elsewhere so something which doesn't have a perfect platform but is more
usable for those who need those features.  Like I said, its an interesting
experiment, we'll see who is right in the end...

I never stated that I believed that Linus wanted to do that.  Lots of
people seem to think that he's doing this though.  I'm just pointing out
that he's not.

Actually yours wasn't at all.  Some of the e-mail I'm getting privately
hasn't quite been as polite though, and I was still doing a bit of a slow
burn...
