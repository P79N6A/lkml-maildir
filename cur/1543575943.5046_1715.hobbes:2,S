I really dropped it because I was getting too many patches, and I don't
realistically think it's a 2.4.0 issue (neither do you, I bet), so I
decided that it's not worth it.
By "I'd love for other architectures to synch up" I really only meant the
Makefile issue - but the hppa thing is pretty much moot as not all of the
code has made it into the kernel yet, so even if the Makefiles were
updated it still wouldn't be "ready".
(Looking at the parisc makefiles the changes to update them to new-style
looks rather small. Not a big issue).
