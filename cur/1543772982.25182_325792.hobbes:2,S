It would be useful to test with a different filesystem (ext3 mounted with
data=writeback is close to equivalent).  That'll help us identify the bug.

Again, if you can temporarily eliminate dm-crypt as well it will help
narrow it down.

Yes.

OK.  sync()+umount() shouldn't take any longer than a bare umount() (which
has to do a sync too).  Unless you have multiple disks, in which case
there's no point in syncing the disks which aren't being umounted.  But
then, I have a feeling that standard util-linux umount(8) does a global
sync anyway.
