What's the best way for a driver running in process context to get a 
middle-length delay, say around 250 microseconds?  By "best", I mean:
	(A) Minimum processor utilization;
	(B) Minimum latency (additional delay beyond the amount 
	    requested).
I realize that these criteria are in conflict and some balance needs to be 
found.  Perhaps the best answer for (A) is msleep(1) or the equivalent, 
while the best answer for (B) is udelay(250).  Are there other 
possibilities that might work out better?
