I've lost my recent archives for this list, so I don't know the backgound to
this :( but I thought a while back there was discussion about an enhanced
smbmount that launched a daemon to manage this sort of thing. There was also
a debate as to where the latest version of smbmount, smbfs, etc. could be
found. Have you looked in one of the archives for this discussion? It might
help, it might not. I hope the former :)
