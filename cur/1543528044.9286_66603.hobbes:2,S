The problem is that "mystring" is a null-terminated ASCII string and char str[12]
is an array of 12 chars, not an ASCII string.  One of the arguable aspects of C
is that _all_ elements get initialized in an array.  It is similar to
{	
	int zeros[10]={ 0 };
	struct { 
		int foo;
		int bar;
	}x = { 1 };
}
In both cases, the entire array or structure has to be cleared.  As Richard
said above, "the problem is bad 'C' code."  Personally, I think that
auto-initialization of auto variables is a nasty feature, and I try to
avoid using it in my own code in cases where it is inequivalent to
initialization of global variables.
