Ian, can you look at this I think you are the best person (maybe
Keithw) to tell whether this stuff breaks compat in any direction,.
Egbert you may not want to lobby for it but all I personally want to
know is what it might potentially break in terms of backwards
compatiblity.... from SuSEs point of view as long as a distro is
consistent then you are okay, for us the whole keeping DRIs built
against older kernels working with newer kernels is the only real
issue...
Hopefully Ian can look at the patch and decide on it....
Dave.
Dave.
