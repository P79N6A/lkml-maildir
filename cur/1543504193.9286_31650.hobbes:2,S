I've tried to apply this patch to 2.3.11.  There were some rejects
not related to framebuffer, though.  I also fixed sevral typos in the
source and generated a new patch against 2.3.11 that applies without 
rejects and doesn't contain these typos.  But this driver sets
improper video mode on my card, it seems that it installs too high
vertical refresh frequency -- my monitor supports videomodes up to
1024x768x60Hz.  
If anyone interested, I put this clean patch on
ftp://lucifer.dorms.spbu.ru/pub/Linux/2.3.11-fb-19990728.patch.gz,
 maybe
it'll work for someone...
