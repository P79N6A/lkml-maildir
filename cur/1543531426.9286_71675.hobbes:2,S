Folks,
  I am one of people supporting these mailinglists, and acting as
  one of assisting postmasters.
  Quite often I see things like what this summary report tells:
FAILED:
  <smtp cedar-republic.com edmond@cedar-republic.com 60000>: ...\
        <<- RCPT To:<edmond@cedar-republic.com>
        ->> 550 <edmond@cedar-republic.com>... we do not relay
  Feeding this address to a page at URL:
	
http://www.zmailer.org/mxverify.html
  Yields information that ONE of their backup MX servers refuses
  to send email thru to them.  Thus whenever all other servers
  fail to be reachable, that one ruins their email connectivity.
  Do make sure YOU don't have this very problem!
