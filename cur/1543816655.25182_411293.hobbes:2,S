Subject: [PATCH] x86_64: extra NODES_SHIFT definition
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/3/27/114

The generic linux/numa.h file defines NODES_SHIFT to 0 in case
the architecture did not.
Every architecture which has a NUMA config option defines
NODES_SHIFT in its asm-$ARCH headers, but only if NUMA is
enabled, except for x86_64.
This should make it like all the rest.
