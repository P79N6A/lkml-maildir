   6/	Deallocates all the buffers by running down the linked-list.
 ...
   If the program deallocates all the buffers, as in (6) above, it will
   take even up to 1 whole minute!! At this time, there is an enormous
   amount of swap-file activity going on.
How exactly are these buffers allocated/deallocated?  Are you
absolutely certain that the deallocation process does not make loads
from or stores into the buffers as a free(3) implementation would?
That would cause the pages to be sucked back from swap space.
