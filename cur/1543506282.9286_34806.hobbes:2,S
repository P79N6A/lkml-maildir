Subject: 2.3.13/14 no boot on i486 cause identified

fyi:  My i486 fails to boot 2.3.13/14 (last boot was pre-2.3.13-1)
I have a bad design 486 board which goes to slow operation 
above 32M ram (have 36M, 4M soldered on board and 32M SIMM in the
single slot) so use lilo mem=32M directive.  On a hunch I removed
the mem=32M directive and pre-2.3.14-2 successfully boots (course
the performance is degraded by a factor of 4 due to the extra
memory).
In short, I assume that lilo and the kernel are not on the same
sheet of music (LILO version 21).
