First look for the (platform-specific) definition of HZ in
include/asm/param.h. This is how many timer interrups you get per second (eg
on i386 it's 100). Then look at include/linux/sched.h for the definition of
DEF_COUNTER. This is the number of timer interrupts between mandatory
schedules. By default it's HZ/10, meaning that the time-slice is 100ms (10
schedules/sec). (of course the interval could be longer if kernel code is
hogging the CPU; the scheduler won't run until the process leaves the kernel
or sleeps explicitly...)
Experts, please correct me if I'm wrong.
Regards,
Dan
