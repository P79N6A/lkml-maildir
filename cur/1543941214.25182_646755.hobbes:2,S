If we dereference NULL then the kernel will display basically the same
information as would a BUG, and it takes the same action.  So adding a
BUG_ON here really doesn't gain us anything.
Also, I think vma->vm_mm == 0 is not a valid state, so this just shouldn't
happen - the code is OK to assume that a particular invariant is being
honoured.
