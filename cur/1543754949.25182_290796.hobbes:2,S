The loop checking takes place in userspace.

Please try what is going to be released as iptables 1.3.0
You can get the latest snapshot here:
ftp://ftp.netfilter.org/pub/iptables/snapshot/iptables-1.3.0-20050127.tar.bz2
Read the file called INSTALL to see how to compile and install it. (and
make sure you are actually using the new version after it's installed,
either by using the absolute patch, /usr/local/sbin/iptables or by
uninstalling the iptables rpm)
It contains a rewrite of libiptc which is the library that performs the
ruleset modifications, it's much faster now.
I hope it improves your situation.
