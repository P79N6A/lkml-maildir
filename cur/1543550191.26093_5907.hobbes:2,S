I can't test it right now, but I had a question or two ...
Is it really necessary to use one of the event counters ? this means those
of us using event counters from modules can't use this oopser at
the same time, which is a pity. 
Can you not set up the actual APIC timer on a local APIC to deliver NMIs
? (Sorry, been a while since I read the intel docs) 
Vincent Oberle has an apic timer module which uses these (link from
kernelnewbies.org for anyone interested).
On the other hand it's good to see that us module event counter users
don't have to do that ugly fixmap thing to get back real access to the
local APIC, now that the zero-page thing is gone :)
thanks
