Well, it is not this simple. What about "group" permissions? 
I do intend to add a "group"-identifier to resolve this, but until then:
when in doubt -> let userspace handle it. In this case, let the
userspace-daemon tell the user that it is forbidden.

Currently, it does not. But it _does_ parse the "Host:" tag so I don't
think adding virtual hosting will be that big a deal. It is just that
other things are more important right now.
