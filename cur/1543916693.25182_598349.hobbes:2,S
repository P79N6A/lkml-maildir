make[2]: *** [drivers/net/pasemi_mac.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [drivers/net] Error 2
make: *** [drivers] Error 2
In the function
static int __devinit
pasemi_mac_probe(struct pci_dev *pdev, const struct pci_device_id *ent)
{
<snip>
struct pasemi_mac *mac;
int err;
DECLARE_MAC_BUF(mac);
introduction of mac as var [18] triggers the build failure, so in the
below patch
renaming mac as mac_buf is done, because it is used to print the mac
address using
the newly introduced print_mac function.
