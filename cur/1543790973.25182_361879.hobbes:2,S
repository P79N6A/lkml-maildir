actually i don't have any more 2.4 kernels due to some problems with
other devices.
however i remember i checked that and it was pretty the same
i know i gave you all few infos, but, ask me and i'll try more.
i have an intel bx440 chipset, udma33.
kernel is perfectly tuned.
i notice that with dma disabled it works much better.
problem happens with hda/hdc, so both ide channels.
hdparm -i /dev/hda
