Ptrace has several ugly things. And I'm thinking those needs
user-visible change more or less to improve, like this.
(->parent/wait4/child_list, PTRACE_SYSCALL/PTRACE_SINGLESTEP ...)
Should we also clean up and improve those with user-visible change?
Those should be thought as separate issue?
I think we should be improved with new interface... (after it, we
can deprecate ptrace)
