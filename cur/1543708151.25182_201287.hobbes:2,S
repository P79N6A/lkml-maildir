If I make it a habit to write portable code, then over the years, I
cause fewer problems for myself and others.  More things "just work". 
I've got scripts that I use that are 10 or 20 years old, and have been
used on all manner of evironments that could not have been anticipated
when the script was first written.
Also my habits need not change - the more things I can do without
thinking, the more thinking I have left over to do something useful.
Somedays, boring beats fine tuning.
