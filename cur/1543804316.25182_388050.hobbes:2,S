If you still have the logs from those, please do send me.  But nobody
else has reported any such tmpfs crashes for two or three years - though
I bet just the saying of that will help someone to remind me I'm wrong ;)
While it's easy to imagine some nasty interaction between swap prefetch
and shmem_writepage's peculiar use of swap, a quick glance at that patch
didn't ring any alarm bells for me, and it's not obvious how a problem
there would result in your particular "BUG_ON(entry->val);" - which could
as well come from random corruption (and GregKH has pointed out that your
kernel is P Tainted).
I've not been testing tmpfs on -ck, but the swap prefetch patch was in
-mm for a while, and I didn't see any such problem when testing there.
Please let me know if you see more such, or can unearth earlier logs.
Hugh
