Subject: [patch 0/7] Add IRQF_IRQPOLL_IRQ flag to allow irqpoll
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

irqpoll is broken on some architectures that don't use the IRQ 0 for the timer
interrupt like IA64. This patch adds a IRQF_IRQPOLL_IRQ flag.
Each architecture is handled in a separate pach. As I left the irq == 0 as
condition, this should not break existing architectures that use timer_irq == 0
and that I did't address with that patch (because I don't know).
