I can't apply this patch ... apparently the email is dual text and
html ... we really need text only for patch application.  Plus, it looks
like your email tool has converted all the tabs in the diff to spaces.
Could you resend.  If you can't get the mailer to comply, just attaching
the diff file usually works.
