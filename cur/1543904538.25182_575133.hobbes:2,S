Sure - makes much more sense

Not necessarily.
Y is the loop counter which counts up to PMUX_LUT_ENTRIES.
I preferably use 16bit variables for loop counters in case I know they
would never overflow.
Reason why I'm doing this is because, Blackfin features zero overhead
hardware loops. Unfortunately the loop counter register is only 16-bit.
Gcc will turn this into slightly better code.

Just a number on top of my head (one page of memory), that fits current
and future needs. I guess we should better turn this into a define.

Sure - much nicer to read.
