Hi Jose,
I completely agree that there is a crying need for standardisation there. The
reason why I propose the LTTng infrastructure as a tracing core in the Linux
kernel is this : the fundamental problem I have found with kernel tracers so
far is that they perturb the system too much or do not offer enough fine
grained protection against reentrancy. Ingo's post about tracing statement
breaking the kernel all the time seems to me like a sufficient proof that this
is a real problem.
My goal with LTTng is to provide a reentrant data serialisation mechanism that
can be called from anywhere in the kernel (ok, the vmalloc path of the page
fault handler is _the_ exception) that does not use any lock and can therefore
trace code paths like NMI handlers.
I also implemented code that would serialize any type of data structure I could
think of. If it is too much, well, we can use part of it.
LTTng trace format is explained there. Your comments on it are very welcome.
