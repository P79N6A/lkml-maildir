I'm not sure that GKHI exposes any more interfaces than embedding a patch
directly into the kernel would.
It has the potential to to make patches easier to re-work for different
kernel versions, and to enable development maintence and fixing of the
patch to be done independently of a kernel build. And it also has the
potential of helping with co-existence. If for example the RAS community
could agree on a number of hooks (I'm thinking here of crash dump, trace,
dprobes and maybe KDB as well) then you'd probably find a good may on them
using then same hooks. The modifications to the kernel would be minimal and
the user would be left an easy means of installing a co-existing subset of
the offerings supported by hooks.
An example: DProbes is down to three hooks - that's three lines of code in
the kernel + three lines in ksyms.c
Patching DProbes onto any custom kernel is a doddle.
