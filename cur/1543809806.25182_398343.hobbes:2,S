uhhh.... did i forget to run Lindent..? Or was it that i just
selected-middle clicked them into thunderbird?
what's the recommended procedure oh how to append patches to
mails? (Documentation just says included not attached...)

I'm not sure what you are talking about. I didn't see any PHY switching
code in the driver... And the specs specifically say that when more than
one PHY is connected control should revert to software.

maxphy is supposed to be how many PHYs are actually connected to the chip.
I didn't want to introduce a generic PHY scanner (which is possible)
because that would have haa impact on all cards not only cards that actually
have more than one phy.
I really tried to put this into pcnet32_open. But i just didn't work...
