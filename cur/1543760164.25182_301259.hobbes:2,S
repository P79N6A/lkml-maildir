It's just a guideline to scope the work.  But a fixed size is probably
less meaningful than your wording.

This can violate the principle of keeping fixes simple for -stable tree.
And Linus/Andrew don't want to litter mainline with patch series that
do simple fix followed by complete fix meant for developement branch.

I agree, it's a good rule, but these should be small, temporal diffs
from mainline.  For example, -ac tree will sometimes do the simpler fix,
whereas mainline does proper complete fix.

Good point.

Agreed.

They don't, the security patches should still be reviewed by subsystem
maintainer.  Point here is, sometimes there's disclosure coordination
happening as well.
