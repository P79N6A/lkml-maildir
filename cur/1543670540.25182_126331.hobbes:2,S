Unfortunetly, I am as swamped as many other here. (I don't have any 
non-Intel platform available to me even if I did have the time, except 
perhaps a 68000 Amiga 500, which may or may not still be in working 
order, but defenitely has no networking). I am saying that cvsup IN 
ADDITION to the rsync will be nice. If the site administrators can't 
maintain it, rsync is preferable for the obvious portability reasons..
Not trying to cause anyone any extra work. Sorry for the noise.
