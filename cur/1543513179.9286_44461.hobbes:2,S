I think it's one for each close of /dev/dsp.  I tried sending a few bytes to
it to see, but I couldn't get it to say it.  The machine that I have this
card in is diskless and I only have mpg123 installed.  I haven't tried
playing multiple files, but my guess is it closes and reopens for each file
it plays.  es1370 does not have this problem (on 2.2.7).  The kernel on the
machine with the es1371 is running 2.2.13pre15.  I don't believe sound has
changed between pre15 to pre17 (or 18 if it's out)
