I have the same problem (keyboard stops working) on 2.2 too. Keyboard is
serial (or what's the non-ps/2 thing called?), mouse is ps/2, happens when I
switch consoles. (in most cases X vs text, but not always, happened to me
once right after reboot too, when switching between 2 text consoles).
I can still ssh into the box and reboot it thou
