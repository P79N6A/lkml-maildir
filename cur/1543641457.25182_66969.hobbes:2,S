While running 2.4.19-pre7-ac2 my system was happily buzzing away.
I upgraded to 2.4.19 and my /dev/hda became /dev/hde which caused
various boot problems, which I worked around.
It seems clear that upon booting 2.4.19, the newer kernel recognized
the "other" IDE controller on the MB, which 2.4.19-pre7-ac2 had not.
The manual that came with the MB said to use the IDE slots marked
IDE0 / IDE1 if I wasn't going to use RAID.
If I wanted to use RAID use the slots marked RAID0/RAID1.
I was just wondering how linux decides which controller is first
(hda-hdd) and which is second (hde-hdh).
Here is what I see from dmesg:
