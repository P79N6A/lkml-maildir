hi,
how takes care about the lp driver ? i saw some changes in the 2.4 but found no maintainer.
to the maintainer:
LPGETSTATS is strange. first you set LP_STAT then you delete it. maybe a EACCES (Permission denied) would do it ?
problem:
calling the ioctl( LPSETIRQ ) the driver returns EINVAL (Invalid argument)instead of ENOSYS.
Fix : return ENOSYS (Function not implemented)
NOTE:
if EINVAL is correct, you can delete the entiere entry, EINVAL in default.
