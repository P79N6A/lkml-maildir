Sure :)  Though I didn't write it... see this collection of bash scripts:
http://people.redhat.com/esandeen/testcases/orphan-repro.tar.bz2
I didn't write it, but it exposed the bug for me.  The VAR file contains 
variables to specify mountpoint and a device, which the script starts by 
mkfs'ing, so be warned.
It spawns -many- threads, and on my 4 CPU opteron I can hit it in a 
reasonable amount of time.  It would probably be nice to have a more 
targeted testcase but it did the trick for me.
Thanks,
