It's all cool, but I'm not entirely convinced why it must be a BUG macro. 
I'd rather have something said via printk here. If whatever we did was 
bad, it will show up with a BUG() just too soon.
I'd describe a macro.
#define list_assert(cond)				\
	if (cond) printk(KERN_ERR "%s failed!\n", #cond)
Or the like. BTW, I'd define LIST_HEAD_DEBUGGING as 1.
