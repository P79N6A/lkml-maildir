Ahem.
I didn't imply that text files are good, only that having a directory 
which contains the /etc/services entries isn't exactly a cool idea either
(neither is a text file, BTW).
It's really a database. So use one -- glibc supports DB or NIS or 
whatever else you want to implement.
I don't think the semantics for correctly updating /etc/services should
be in the kernel. Where does it stop? Next you'll want /etc/smb.conf, or
/etc/XF86Config. Surprise, I want it too, but not that way please.
