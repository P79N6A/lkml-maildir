Hi,
it's not matter of .config. It's matter of compiler. I can't reproduce it on my
own, I just know, that Dave had problems with inline prototypes and using of the
function they declare before the body itself was available with some gcc 3.4.6.
Dave, don't you remember where did you get the compiler from and what was the
platform?
