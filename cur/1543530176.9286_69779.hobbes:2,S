Hello,
I have noticed that I do have an 'immortal' connection on my box. The client does
connect over dialup with secure pop3, which is locally wrapped to insecure pop3. However,
the connection still remains open a long time after the client has disconnected.
( read - terminated connection, the mail client disconnects after exitting ) I tried to
watch communication between the remote host and my box, but there is no active packet exchange
at all. I would rather suspect the is some -timeout- mechanism that would terminate the connection,
transparently...
Is this normal ? I'm using 2.2.15pre14, but I have observed this quite some time ago with
older pre releases, but on connection comming ONLY from dialups. Is there anything that I may 
look for ?
Netstat report: ( this connection is about 9 hrs old )
tcp       37      0 mail.scssoft.com:4301   mail.scssoft.com:pop-3  CLOSE_WAIT  off (0.00/0/0)
tcp        0      0 mail.scssoft.com:spop3  datelc-164.vol.cz:1036  ESTABLISHED off (0.00/0/0)
