i agree with the hack part - but the performance aspect has been blown
out of proportion. 4:4 has the same cost on kernel compiles as highpte.
There are also real workloads where it actually helps performance.
also, the 4:4 overhead is really a hardware problem - and there are
x86-compatible CPUs (amd64) where the TLB flush problem has already been
solved: on amd64 the 4:4 feature has no noticeable overhead. So as long
as people opt for a 32-bit OS (even on a 64-bit CPU, for whatever weird
compatibility reason), 4:4 can be useful. For the other workloads i as
much hope as everyone else that people switch to a 64-bit OS on x86-64
ASAP!
also, while a quick transition to x86-64 will most likely happen, the
large installed base of big x86 boxes is a matter of fact too - and they
wont vanish into thin air. Also, there will always be specific user
workloads where lowmem grows to large values. Not to mention the fact
that 4:4 is a nice debugging/security tool as you cannot dereference
user pointers ;) - it has caught countless bugs already. Plus there are
specific workloads that want 4GB of userspace (and no, 3.5 GB wont do).
So 4:4 will have its niches where it will live on. We could argue on and
on how quickly 'x86 with more than 4GB of RAM' and 'x86 with 4GB of a
userspace' will become a niche, hopefully it happens fast but we've got
to keep our options open.
