I think you mean the tty layer here - the tty layer is where most of
the serialisation problems remain, and the locking in the serial
layer is mostly there to work around the tty layers deficiencies.
I would have liked to have rewritten the tty layer along the lines
that Ted was suggesting, but that would've been far too much work
for me to do alone.
