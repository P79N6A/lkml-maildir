I'm sorry, I thought it's already in mainline, but that bit is still
missing from the sysfs support in input. It'll get there soon.

In that case, you'll likely want something like io0200/input0, where
0x200 would be the io address of the device. On the other hand, if it's
really embedded and there can't be two pinpads in the system, it's not a
problem to use basically any string there, since it only needs to be
system-unique.
