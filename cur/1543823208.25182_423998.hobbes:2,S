I don't think the if and the else block is doing the same thing. In the if
block, the p->sleep_avg is unconditionally boosted to ceiling for all tasks,
though it will not reduce sleep_avg for tasks that already exceed the ceiling.
Bumping up sleep_avg will then translate into priority boost of MAX_BONUS-1,
which potentially can be too high.
But that's fine if it is the intent. At minimum, the comment in the source
code should say so instead of fooling people who don't actually read the code.
[patch] sched: update comments in priority calculation w.r.t. implementation.
