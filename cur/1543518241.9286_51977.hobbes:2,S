The bash shell ignores the CS8 parm as well as the ~ISTRIP parm when you
call tcsetattr.  In fact, it does absolutely nothing and the terminal
still outputs 7 bit characters.  Someone at Caldera told me there was a
TTY ioctl I needed to call to turn it on in "true" 8 bit mode, but I
think this may have been incorrect.  If it's a driver issue it belongs
here, so I asked -- it that ok?  Alan Cox actually has already cleared
this up, so you were a little late to the party, but thanks anyhow.
