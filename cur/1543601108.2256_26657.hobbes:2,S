  Actually that delayed printing of quota messages isn't even in regular
2.4 - it's just in ac-patches. Regular 2.4 has just print_warning()
function which works rather the same way as printing in 2.2.
  Currently I think that just increasing the buffer size is enough. If
someone really wanted the port from 2.4 I can make it but I'm really not sure
it's 2.2 thing and I'm not sure it's worth the work...
