Provided when the two are about the same part of a file.  If not, and if
the file is "divided" on a proper boundary (sector/page/whatever-aligned),
there's no issues, at least not if all the blocks of a file has been allocated
(no gaps, that is).
What I was referring to in my last email - and said it's a corner case - is:
mmap() start of a file, say, first megabyte of it, where some index/bitmap is
located, and use direct-io on the rest.  So the two aren't overlap.
Still problematic?

I do understand this.  And this is, too, solved right now in userspace.
For example, when oracle allocates a file for its data, or when it extends
the file, it writes something to every block of new space (using O_DIRECT
while at it, but that's a different story).  The thing is: while it is doing
that, no process tries to do anything with that (part of a) file (not counting
some external processes run by evil hackers ;)  So there's still no races
or fundamental brokeness *in usage*.
It uses ftruncate() to create or extend a file, *and* does O_DIRECT writes
to force block allocations.  That's probably not right, and that alone is
probably difficult to implement in kernel (I just don't know; what I know
for sure is that this way is very slow on ext3).  Maybe because there's no
way to tell kernel something like "set the file size to this and actually
*allocate* space for it" (if it doesn't write some structure to the file).
What I dislike very much is - half-solutions.  And current O_DIRECT indeed
looks like half-a-solution, because sometimes it works, and sometimes, in
*wrong* usage scenario, it doesn't, or racy, etc, and kernel *allows* such
a wrong scenario.  A software should either work correctly, or disallow
a usage where it can't guarantee correctness.  Currently, kernel allows
incorrect usage, and that, plus all the ugly things in code done in attempt
to fix that, suxx.
But the whole thing is not (fundamentally) broken.
