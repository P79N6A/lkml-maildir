Uh, no, this just wraps band-aid around the problem. First of all, not all
cpufreq drivers like to be left and re-initialized. Secondly, the timing
code might still not adapt to the new CPU frequency. And thirdly, we can
solve these issues if we call

	cpufreq_update_policy();
here instead. (untested, but should work)
