In theory, I think yes, if all IRQs on the system run in threads except
the saw interrupt, and the RT task that controls the saw runs at a
higher priority than all the IRQ threads.  You can guarantee that other
interrupts won't delay the saw, because the saw irq is the only thing on
the system that runs in interrupt context.  With the current VP
implementation you are still bounded by the longest non-preemptible code
path in the kernel AKA the longest time that a spinlock is held. 
Replacing most spinlocks with mutexes reduces this to less than 20 code
paths according to Mvista, which then can be individually audited for
RT-safeness. 
That being said, no way would I put my hand under the saw with the
current implementation.  But, unless I am missing something, it seems
like this kind of determinism is possible with the Mvista design.

I will check that out, I have not looked at RTAI in over a year.
