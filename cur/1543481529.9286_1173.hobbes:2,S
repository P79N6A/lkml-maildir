i'm curious about this as well.
i've set alignment on PPro and K6 machines i use to 64 bytes, since the
cache lines on the K6 are 32 bytes each, and are burst loaded from RAM
two-at-a-time. i assume the PPro caches work the same way, but haven't
checked the spec sheet.
perhaps a more reasonable alignment might be 64 bytes for functions, and 8
or 16 bytes for loops and jumps.
the results have been inconclusive, but certainly not dangerous to
performance or stability.
