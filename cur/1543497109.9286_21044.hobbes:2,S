Hello,
I have made available 2 SYM53C8XX driver versions that I would want to be
tested on production(like) systems, so that they will be candidate for the
kernel mainstream: 
Version 1.5b
------------
It is the latest one and has been heavily augmented and hopefully improved.
The 1.5 driver series will be candidate for 2.3 kernels.
Version 1.3f
------------
It only contains fixes against current driver of 2.2 kernels. This one will 
be candidate for 2.2 (and may-be 2.0 kernels if some will be released).

If you have time and hardware for giving these drivers a try, and let me
know if you encountered problems using them, this will help. 
I only have P5/PII machines, and unless somebody else tested these drivers
on non-Intel-like hardware, they never booted on real machines;-). So, you
must be careful if you intend to evaluate these drivers on non-Intel-like
machines. Driver 1.3f should work for Alpha since I have incorporated a
fix that I received a couple of weeks ago. 
Patches are available at 
ftp://ftp.tux.org/pub/roudier/
Here is a brief description of the files available at this location:
1. Incremental patches for common kernel versions:
	./drivers/linux/sym53c8xx/
		README
		<files of the pattern patch-53c8xx-vvv-sss-kkk.gz>
	The README file is here to help you.
2. Latest driver version diffs against the latest kernels we have had time 
   to have a look at.
	./drivers/linux/experimental/
		patch-53c8xx-1.5b-2.0.36.gz
		patch-53c8xx-1.5b-2.0.37-pre12.gz
		patch-53c8xx-1.5b-2.2.9.gz	(for 2.2.9 up to 2.3.3 kernels)
3. Diffs for driver versions assumed stable.
	./drivers/linux/stable/
		patch-53c8xx-1.4-2.0.36.gz
		patch-53c8xx-1.4-2.0.36-pristine.gz
		patch-53c8xx-1.3f-2.2.5.gz
		patch-53c8xx-1.3f-2.2.7.gz	(for 2.2.7 up to 2.2.9 kernels)
No need to use incremental patches. The patches in 'experimental' and
'stable' directories should fit.
Enjoy and thanks for testing new driver versions.
Gérard.
