Presuming normal cacheable memory here...
Processor Ordering is the same as strong ordering except you just may not
see all the stores from the other processors yet.  There is no violation
of program ordering with respect to other processors, and those you do
see guarantee you have seen any one earlier in the store sequence.  So,
in general, I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish with a read
memory barrier on IA32 for cacheable memory.
For the unlock, the use of any store will guarantee that all prior
instructions are committed before the results of the store are externally
observable.
For the following case:
	spin_lock(X);
	READ Y;
...*regardless* of speculation, the value gotten by "READ Y" will be
consistent with anything observed by the processor in "spin_lock", else
it violates the program order, and normal programs would not work very
well.  It's perfectly OK to hoist "READ Y" above "spin_lock"
speculatively...  for example, consider the following sequence:
  --  processor A:  "READ Y" is speculatively executed, now waiting
	to be committed to state.
  --  processor A:  "spin_lock(X)" is spinning in it's loop...
  --  processor B:  executes "STORE Y", then executes "spin_unlock(X)"
Now NOTE:
  --  processor A:  to observe X for the "spin_lock(X)" to succeed, it
	*must* observe "STORE Y" first.
  --  processor A:  observing "STORE Y" requires it to throw away the
	speculative "READ Y" with the possibly wrong value.  It may
	attempt to reexecute "READ Y" at this time with the correct
	value.
  --  processor A:  now "spin_lock(X)" can see the new value of X and
	finish.
If there was no dependency on the spinlock variables, then it's irrelevant
if "READ Y" was executed before "spin_lock(X)", since you have no idea
when the other processor executed "STORE Y".  No dependencies are violated.
