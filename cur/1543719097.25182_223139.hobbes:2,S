The kernel already spits out this information, it's up to userspace
tools to recognize it and create such a dialog if needed.  See the HAL
project for one such tool that is activly working on this.
The hotplug package already will automatically load drivers for new
devices, so that portion of what you are looking for is completed.

See all of the different companies that today submit their info to the
pci sf.net site you linked to for that kind of information.
Remember, an id by itself is pointless.  We need specs and drivers that
work for those specs.  You should concentrate on that goal instead of
worrying about ids.

As we are going to rip the pci.ids file out of the 2.7 kernel tree,
pretty much so :)
