My apologies, it is already there in 2.4.21, however I have been monitoring
the change logs, and I can't see it mentioned there anywhere.
Thanks very much for pointing this out.
Kevin

Hi,
The patch for the generic HDLC layer was included on the kernel 2.4.21. Thus
this layer is already on the main tree (unless, of course, someone has
removed it, I havent checked 2.4.22 yet). This layer provides data link
protocol (ppp, hdlc, raw-hdlc, x25, frame-relay, cisco-hdlc) for the kernel.
It's mainly used by synchronous cards drivers (Cyclades, Moxa, SDL, Farsite,
etc, etc, etc). regards Henrique
