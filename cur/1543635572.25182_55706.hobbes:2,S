There has also been some work done by Michael Olsen (cmolsen@us.ibm.com)
regarding noperiodic jiffie updates. This was in the context of embedded 
handheld devices, in particular IBM's LinuxWatch. Similar problem
arise in such devices where the timer tick can be a significant source of 
battery drainage.
There are/were some settled differences between Michael and Martin approach, 
which I won't be able to adequately describe. 
I believe Michael has a publication on this, I let him respond.
