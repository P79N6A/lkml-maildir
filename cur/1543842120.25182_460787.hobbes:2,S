Very nice piece of work ! Thanks for taking this up :)
I have looked through all the patches and the completion path unification
logic looks sound to me (btw, the explanations and comments are very good too).
Not the usual bandaids that we often end up with, but a real cleanup that
should go some way in making at least the most errorprone part of the DIO
code more maintainable (I hope/wish we could also do something similar with
simplifying the locking as well).
Of course with this code, we have to await rigorous testing
... and more reviews, but please consider this as my ack for the approach.
