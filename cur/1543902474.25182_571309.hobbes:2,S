Hmm. I started wondering about this. 
Sure, ide-disk doesn't like non-fs requests, but I'm wondering why the 
error apparently keeps repeating? We should error out once, and that 
should be it.
So I'm wondering whether the
	ide_end_request(drive, 0, 0);
	return ide_stopped;
is the real bug.
The thing is, non-fs requests won't have nr_sectors set, so the 0 will 
stay as a zero (the IDE layer has some "turn zero into current sector 
number", but that doesn't work for commands that aren't sector-based!), 
and as a result, we'll "complete" zero bytes, and the bio will stay 
active!
So the code should probably at the _least_ say that it's finished one 
whole sector, and it would probably be much better to make it be based on 
"rq->data_len", which should be reliable.
Of course, since the "ide_end_request()" takes the data in sectors, but 
the request layer does it in bytes, we have to round the thing up and the 
ide_end_request() thing will turn it into too many bytes, but that's ok - 
"end_that_request_first()" doesn't care if we complete "too many" bytes.
So a diff something like this is, I think, the right thing to do, and 
should make the IDE disk driver handle non-fs requests gracefully (it will 
*fail* them, of course, but that's another issue).
Bartlomiej? Am I missing soemthing?
