it modulates the clock so the CPU isn't always availble for doing work.

it reduces the amount of heat generated, by making jobs
take longer to finish. This comes at a cost of the CPU not
being able to enter lower C states for longer periods of time,
so you may end up actually using *more* power.

The CPU was always at 2.4GHz, even if it said '200MHz'.
It was just only doing work once in every 12 clocks.
