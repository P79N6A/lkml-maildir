No. Remapping a valid number to something else means remapping at
runtime for all things that manipulate an irq : issuing it,
enable/disable callbacks, etc...
"Fixing" the definition of "no irq" on x86 means only changing the boot
code that sets up irq numbers, whatever it is.
Thus what solution is technically superior can be argued based on the
fact that your solution introduce overhead to code path that are hot
during normal kernel operations.
