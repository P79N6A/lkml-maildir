Ok, from the sysrq-T stuff it _looks_ like X is just busy-looping in user 
space. So it's probably some disagreement between radeonfb and X.org
The fact that everything was ok in -rc5 would imply that it's likely one 
of the radeon aperture size issue patches.

I'm cc'ing BenH and DaveA, but in the meantime, while waiting for the 
professionals, can you try to revert the two attachments (revert "diff-1" 
first, try that, and revert "diff-2" after that if it didn't start 
working after the first revert).
Thanks,

    [PATCH] radeon drm: fix agp aperture map offset
    
    This finally fixes the radeon memory mapping bug that was incorrectly
    fixed by the previous patch.  This time, we use the actual vram size as
    the size to calculate how far to move the AGP aperture from the
    framebuffer in card's memory space.
    
    If there are still issues with this patch, they are due to bugs in the X
    driver that I'm working on fixing too.

    [drm] fix radeon aperture issue
    
    Ben noticed that on certain cards we've landed the AGP space on top of
    the second aperture instead of after it..  Which messes things up a lot
    on those machines.
    
    This just moves the gart further out, a more correct fix is in the works
    from Ben for after 2.6.15.
