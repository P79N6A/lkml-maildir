We are using our own user space loader now, but a kernel space loader is 
  neither portable or practical.
The Wine project is used by many people and companies for both comercial 
and non-comercial purposes.  In the spirit of cooperation, it would be 
nice if somebody let us know when they're going to make a change that is 
going to break Wine, and provide a way for us to workaround that change, 
or even better maintain real binary compatability...
It seems Linus's kernel does that quite well, but some vendors seem not 
to care too much about breaking Wine.
