Process groups are also pids, and there are direct relationships
between pids and process group ids and session ids.  I agree keeping
the focus tight make sense but not so tight that you miss pieces.

A very common comment on the thread up to now is that people haven't
seen the big picture so they can't comment.

You can also make the kernel functions that take a pidspace argument
and you will have instant compile failures :)

So only very special pids can generate a pidspace.  That will
tend to reduce the generality of the solution.  What do you do
if I am running your code in a vserver?
There enough possibilities to the solution space a few extra
constraints I think would help in this case.

I can see the desire.  But top is already strongly challenged if
you are talking hpc computing.  It only works on one node.  Anything
that teaches proc about multiple node mounts ought to work just
as well for an internal checkpoint restart implementation.

Look at siginfo_t si_pid....

This is of course the definition.  But how you implement those cases
is interesting.

I think you will ultimately want a new filesystem namespace
not just a chroot, so you can ``virtualize'' your filesystem namespace
as well.

I wonder if you could hook up with the linux vserver project.  The
requirements are strongly similar, and making a solution that
would work for everyone has a better chance of getting in.
