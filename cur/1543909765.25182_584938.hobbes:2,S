I think so.
And you would be able to add yourself even if you're merely
interested in something, not a maintainer.
However I think the mailing lists could do better. Duplicate

And they could eventually supersede the subsystem mailing lists
we use today. Just use net@kernel.org or drivers.net@kernel.org.
