BTW. Why does your OOM killer in 2.4 try to kill process that mmaped most
memory? mmap is hamrless. mmap on files can't eat memory and swap.
Imagine a case: you have database server that mmaps the whole 2G file but
doesn't have too much anonymous memory. You have an offending process that
does while (1) malloc(1000) and fills up 512M swap. Your OOM killer would
kill the server first...
