Linux uses an interrupt gate (int $0x80).  The code that handles the
entry to kernel mode is in arch/i386/kernel/entry.S

The stack segment is a flat segment just like the code and data
segments.  The stack size is fixed and is allocated to be two pages (8k
on x86).  There is no mechanism in place to enforce the stack boundaries
other than a possible page fault.  The task structure is located at the
bottom of the stack space so it would get overwritten before any fault
would occur anyways.
