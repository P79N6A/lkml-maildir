For starters, the output of 'uname -a', the architecture/hardware you're
running on, and if your dmesg has any hints about which time source it's
using. On my Dell laptop, I see:
Dec 26 19:11:22 turing-police kernel: PID hash table entries: 1024 (order: 10, 16384 bytes)
Dec 26 19:11:22 turing-police kernel: Detected 1595.344 MHz processor.
Dec 26 19:11:22 turing-police kernel: Using pmtmr for high-res timesource
Dec 26 19:11:22 turing-police kernel: Console: colour dummy device 80x25
Dec 26 19:11:22 turing-police kernel: Dentry cache hash table entries: 65536 (order: 6, 262144 bytes)
Dec 26 19:11:22 turing-police kernel: Inode-cache hash table entries: 32768 (order: 5, 131072 bytes)
Most x86 systems should have a similar note of the timesource right
around that point of the dmesg.
