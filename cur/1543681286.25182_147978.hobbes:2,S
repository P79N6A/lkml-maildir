Quite frankly, for Xbox support I want it to become a lot more commonly 
used before I actually put it into the standard kernel. 
Why? Simply because for now it's still a fairly specialized thing, and as
such I have to weigh the benefits of including it in the standard kernel
against the negatives of just being a bit politically "hot potato".
Don't get me wrong: I think doing an Xbox port is fine. It's just that 
putting it in the standard tree is not likely a good idea. I can well 
imagine a number of Linux distributors who do not feel like they need the 
aggravation ;)
