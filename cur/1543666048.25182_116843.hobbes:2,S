There is a "fixed" (I hope) linux-2.4 tree up.  We're still converting the
2.5 tree, ETA is about 6 hours (the fix substantially slowed down the 
coversion process, did I mention that this stuff is a pain?).  I'm going 
out for a while but I'll send out mail when the 2.5 tree is up.
If you have worked on files in 2.4 please go poke at them at 
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@kernel.bkbits.net:/home/cvs rlog linux-2.4/<your file>
and see if you think that is accurate.  Let me know either way.  Thanks.
