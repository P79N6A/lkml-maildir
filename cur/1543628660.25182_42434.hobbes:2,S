why is exact match of floating point not possible ?
what i understand is if you  do a  " x/y " (where x and y are two integers ) 
division in hardware then you should always get the same value , then why 
can't we compare floating point "==" operation ?
   I understand that in case of inrrational number it will not give a exact 
value ......but division like 1/.2 is not irrational ! and it should always 
come to 5 !
