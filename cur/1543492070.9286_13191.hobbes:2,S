hmm.  1-2% can be a huge difference over time.  being that we aim to run
servers for years between downtime, this is a very significant figure.  in
varying environments and over time an object could could be the base of a
time slew.  if the original figure is modified by such a percentage over
time then the impact can certainly be "worthy".
consider a server that pumps out 4million hits a day.  what's one percent of
that worth?  perhaps you're benching.  another 40K hits is a fair addition. 
at 2%, 80K is quite significant.
now take a dozen tweeks at 1-2% of benefit.  every little bit helps.
640K out to be enough for anyone.  oh, another few k isn't a big
deal...don't bother about being efficient.
we(i) use linux because it's built to higher standards.  i very much enjoy
tweeking code for a tiny bit of performance and/or efficiency gain.
