Very well said Linus.  And of course I have no problem understanding 
the reasons behind the reasoning.  However, that doesn't help us pour 
schmucks out here in la-la land trying to make the most recent nvidia 
module work with the latest kernel on our now elderly gforce2's.  I'd 
like to have some OpenGL support for instance, but for everything 
else, nv is probably 100x more stable than the nvidia binary.  So we 
run nv.  Maybe someday nvidia will get baptised, but *I'm* not 
counting on it.
Its not your emails (as Linus) to nvidia that will fix that, but a 
concerted effort, emailing them for a resolution from everyone who 
owns one of their products _might_ eventually make a difference.
OTOH, they're going to listen to their IP lawyers & not us. so...
