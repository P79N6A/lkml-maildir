Yes.  The review I've gotten so far has been of the "it works for me,
thanks" variety.
(The only issue reported to me is that NO_HZ on AT91 seems to make the
DBGU lose characters sometimes ... that one-byte "fifo" makes trouble
whenever there's the slightest delay in IRQ handling, and NO_HZ can
easily add such delays as part of ensuring that "jiffies" is current
before invoking handlers.)

This is part of the system timer code, and it should never be a
preemption point.  Plus I didn't want to waste any instruction
cycles in code that runs before e.g. the DBGU IRQ handler would
get called... observably, such extra cycles *do* hurt.

I take that back about late review being better than none.  ;)

I can't know that some other platform won't have a better system
timer solution, and didn't want to assume that only that single
venerable chip had such a solution ... it's kind of puzzling to
me (software guy) that none of the newest Atmel SOCs have better
timer infrastructure than they do.  ;)

No, ONESHOT means "stop after the IRQ I asked for".  And when
tc_next_event() is asked to trigger that IRQ, it's relative to
the instant it's requested, not relative to the last one that
was requested (which may not have triggered yet, or may have
been quite some time ago).

That could be done, yes ... and using request_irq()/free_irq()
would also let this be linked as a module, not just statically.
On the other hand, doing it this way doesn't hurt either does it?
Unless a modular build is important.

On current chips, that's how it works.

Nothing much, except that I took the more concise path.  Got patch?

That could work too, but if it goes that way then there's no
point in changes to support a modular build (e.g. the irqaction
thing you noted above).

Well, "force" seems the wrong approach to me.  That should be a
board-specific choice.  The ap700x power budget may not be the
most important system design consideration, so making such a
decision at the platform ("ap700x") level seems wrong.
Suppose someone has to build an AVR32 based system that uses both
TCB modules to hook up to external hardware, so that neither one
is available for use as a "system timer"?
