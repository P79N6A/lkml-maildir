I see. While this can be worked around by adding flag set up after inode
initialization, this would become ugly shortly.

->read_inode2 is a hack. And especially so is having both ->read_inode
and ->read_inode2. iget() interface was based on the assumption that
inodes can be located (and identified) by inode number. It is not so at
least for the reiserfs and ->read_inode2 works around this by passing
"cookie" with information sufficient for file system to locate inode.
I am concerned that (ab)using this cookie and ->read_inode2 to bypass
rigid iget() is not right way to go. What about VFS exporting function
that checks hash table, creates new inode if not there and returns it
still locked? This way each file system would be able to locate and load
inodes in a way it likes without encoding/decoding information in the
cookie.
