Ok, thanks for clearing that up.  My reasoning for wanting this is because a CD
I had mounted with cdfs was screwed up in the mount (file sizes were
misreported, etc), and I couldn't umount it, even tho I could eject it with
cdrecord -eject.  The umount process then went to sleep (with teh 'D' showing
in ps/top), and I couldn't use that drive again until after a reboot.  That's
when I got the idea that I should be able to destroy the process completely,
annihilating everything with it, destroying any connections it has with the
kernel, etc.  I guess it's a bad idea, given your statement :P
Anyway, thanks for the reply,
Justin
