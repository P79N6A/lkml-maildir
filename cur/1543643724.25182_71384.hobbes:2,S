By and large I've been using existing tools, for instance, multiple
tiobench instances to obtain a large task count. The test cases I've
had to construct by hand are generally meant to trigger pagetable OOM,
which I've been assigned to do something about. In general, I attempt
to simulate the VM and I/O characteristics of databases. Sometimes I
have to get a bit inventive, e.g. recent 2*dbench 512 on tmpfs test.
Thanks,
Bill
