feel free to extend the "excludemem=" mechanism to support the full 
range of "badram=" configuration methods. As long as you are able to 
feed it into an e820 table (which is not trivial at all), it's the right 
thing to do and it would be mainstream acceptable.
and i wouldnt mind the "badmem=" option either - because you already 
have users of that facility and it's intuitively named as well - as long 
as it's cleanly fed into the e820 space. I.e. it would all look and 
behave the same way towards users as the BadMem patch does - with a 
different internal approach.
