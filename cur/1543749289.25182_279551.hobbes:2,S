Just so. The compiler will check some or all of the cases first, and 
then take the default case. If you look at the code with and without 
optimization (use -S) you will see that it behaves the same way 
regardless of the placement of the default case. There is one exception, 
that is the one where control falls through from one case to another, 
and the default case is not last and lacks a break, such that the 
default winds up executing the code from the case(s) following.
Do I have to say that the code doing stuff like that is hard to read?
