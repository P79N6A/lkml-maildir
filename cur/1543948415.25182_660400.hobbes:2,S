When bluez tried to connect SCO channel with HCI_OP_SETUP_SYNC_CONN(ESCO_LINK), 
a real connection may be connected with SCO_LINK instead of ESCO_LINK when 
peer device doesn't support eSCO.  however bluez try to find connection handle 
by event's link type(SCO_LINK in above case) and the valid connection handle 
for this event is waiting for ESCO_LINK. so bluez can't find connection handle 
and discarded the event. 
This patch is to handle different type of synchronous link is estabilished 
with its request. 
If bluez can't find connection handle, it try to find with different 
link type again. (For the above case, if bluez can't find connection 
handle with SCO_LINK, it try to find connection handle with ESCO_LINK again.)
and update link type of this connection handle with event's link type.
