Well hold on a sec. We don't need to use the hugepages pool for this,
do we? This is the same as using huge page mappings for the whole of
kernel space on ia32. As long as it's a kernel mapping, and 16MB aligned
and contig, we get it for free, surely?

Yes, that'd bork it. But I thought that they had a large sheaf of
mapping sizes to chose from on ia64?

For the general case I'd agree. But this is a setup-time only tweak
of the static kernel mapping, isn't it?
I'm not saying it needs doing now. But it's an interesting future
enhancement.
