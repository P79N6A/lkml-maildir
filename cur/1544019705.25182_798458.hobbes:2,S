Some explanation of the test program. 
./schedulerissue 1 4096 8 2000
1 producer and 1 consumer
buffer size of 4096 doubles * 8byte 
8 buffer (256kB total buffer)
2000 messages
./schedulerissue 2 4096 8 2000
2 producer and 2 consumer
buffer size of 4096 doubles * 8byte 
8 buffer (256kB total buffer)
2000 messages
It was not 512KB bytes in the test before, but 4MB.
But there is the same problem with a total buffer size of 48kB and 4
threads (./schedulerissue 2 2048 3 20000).
