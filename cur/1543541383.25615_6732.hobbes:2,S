Hello,
Is there somewhere a document describing the POSIX implementation choices
done in the kernel ? Specifically, what are the relations-ship between
POSIX threads and the kernel threads ? What is the contention scope
of the pthread implementation, etc. ?
If necessary, I can be more specific :-)
A+,
