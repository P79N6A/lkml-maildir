serial_close is safe because serial_disconnect lowers the refcount
by one. usb_serial_probe() and usb_serial_open() both increment
the refcount; the former implicitly.

The data structure to protect is serial_table. Everything else is
protected by refcounts. Therefore the interesting race is between
open and disconnect. Open is called with BKL (fs/char_dev.c::chrdev_open)
Now, regarding disconnect. It used to be called with BKL held. I haven't been
able to verify that this is still the case. If not, then there's a race.
In addition usb_serial_probe() uses get_free_serial() early in the process
before the device is ready. Without BKL, this too, races with open.
People, do we take BKL in khubd?
