O_STREAMING is an interesting idea (I talked with stefan traby about
the problem and we came to a similar conclusion - fadvise instead of
madvise, and per-file characteristics as opposed to blockdevices or global
settings).
Anyway, so far it really looks as if this is the case - there is some
limit (around 700 conns) where the available memory doesn't suffice for
read-ahead.
