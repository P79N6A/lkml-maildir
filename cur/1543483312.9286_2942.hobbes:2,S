Subject: 802.1Q VLAN code (Pre-Alpha) is up on my web page.

This code should give you the ability to set up up to 4096 VLAN devices
on __each__ ethernet device.  I have also added code to allow layer-two
switching between devices (untested as well!). There is more,
but please see my web page for information and code to download:

This code is very raw, I haven't done any real testing yet,
but it doesn't seem to crash the box to mess with the devices at least!!
:)
Comments are welcome, especially any ideas or syntax on how to create
patches against several files in different directories.
Enjoy,
