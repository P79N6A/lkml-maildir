Thanks Ingo, I didn't know about this. I'll look into it further when I
have more time, and maybe my tools already implement things that need to
be done in here, and I can port them (if they're interested).  I first
wrote this back in 1998 or 1999 and have added on since then. So it is
pretty mature. Unfortunately I still had to clean it up for the post. It
was only for my personal use till someone mentioned to me that I should
share it.
Also, I'm almost done adding the pending owner work against .41-11. I
see you now have 41-13, and if you already implemented it, let me know.
I've been fighting your deadlock detection to make sure it works with
the changes. Then finally I found a race condition that I'm solving.
To have a task take back the ownership, I had the stealer call
task_blocks_on_lock on the task that it stole it from. To get this to
work, when a task is given the pending ownership, it doesn't NULL the
blocked_on at that point (although the waiter->task is set to NULL). But
this gives the race condition in pi_setprio where it checks for
p->blocked_on still exists. Reason is that I don't want the waking up of
a process to call any more locks. To solve this, I had to (and this is
what I don't like right now) add another flag for the process called
PF_BLOCKED. So that this can tell the pi_setprio when to stop. This flag
is set in task_blocks_on_lock and cleared in pick_new_owner where the
setting of blocked_on to NULL use to be.
Unless you already implemented this, I'll have a patch for you to look
at later today, and you can then (if you want) critique it :-)
