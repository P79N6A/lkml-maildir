Bryan Sparks says no to open sourcing this code in Linux. Sorry -- I 
asked. I am allowed to open source any modifications
to public kernel sources like dev.c since we have an obligation to do 
so. I will provide source code enhancements for the kernel
for anyone who purchases our Linux based appliances and asks for the 
source code (so says Bryan Sparks). You can issue a purchase
request to Bryan Sparks (bryan@devicelogics.com) if you want any source 
code changes for the Linux kernel.

There are about four pages of listings of open source tools and scripts 
that do this -- we support all of them.

I agree. I have also noticed that CISCO routers are not even able to 
withstand these rates with 64 byte packets without dropping them,
so I agree this is not real world. It is useful testing howevr, to 
determine the limits and bottlenecks of where things break.

I can sustain full line rate gigabit on two adapters at the tsame time 
with a 12 CLK interpacket gap time and 0 dropped packets at 64
byte sizes from a Smartbits to Linux provided the adapter ring buffer is 
loaded with static addresses. This demonstrates that it is
possible to sustain 64 byte packet rates at full line rate with current 
DMA architectures on 400 Mhz buses with Linux.
(which means it will handle any network loading scenario). The 
bottleneck from my measurements appears to be the
overhead of serializing writes to the adapter ring buffer IO memory. The 
current drivers also perform interrupt
coalescing very well with Linux. What's needed is a method for 
submission of ring buffer entries that can be sent in large
scatter gather listings rather than one at a time. Ring buffers exhibit 
sequential behavior so this method should work well
to support 1Gbe and 10Gbe at full line rate with small packet sizes.
