Subject: [PATCH] don't waste swap on locked pages
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

try_to_unmap always fails on a page found in a VM_LOCKED vma (unless
migrating), and recycles it back to the active list.  But if it's an
anonymous page, we've already allocated swap to it: just wasting swap.
Spot locked pages in page_referenced_one and treat them as referenced.
