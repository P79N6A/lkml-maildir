The hisax driver already has a MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE entry for it's pci
devices, and this data shows up in the modules.pcimap table in the
modules directory.
Russell, when /sbin/hotplug is part of the initramfs in 2.5, the driver
will automatically be loaded for your new card, IF you have all the
different modules already built.  You will not need autoconfigure, just
a good vendor kernel :)
Giacomo, please, please, please, just use the info in the
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE entries for your autoconfigure program.  Don't try
to keep all of this data up to date by hand, just use the info that is
already in the kernel.  It is a battle you will always loose.  Automate
this process (David Brownell has made a proposal that will work for
you), and you will never have to generate those PCI and USB tables by
hand again.
One other autoconfigure problem that I don't think anyone has mentioned,
USB devices that only show up when they want to transfer data to/from
the host.  Like all of the Palm based devices.  They don't stay
connected long enough for a "probe all the busses" tool like
you are currently developing to detect.
thanks,
