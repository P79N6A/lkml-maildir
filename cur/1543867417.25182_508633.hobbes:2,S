Hi,
I'm sorry that I couldn't reply you sooner.

I considered for a while, and then I decided not to use the
above-stated interfaces. Instead, I'll create just one proc entry
to access to one core dump flag:
  /proc/<pid>/coredump_omit_anonymous_shared
I think it is simple enough.
Would you think it is still ugly?

Yes, using ulimit will be simpler and faster, but less flexible.
The core dump flags can be changed only before running the program.
If the user modifies the program, the user will be able to change the
flags anytime. But the user can't always modify the program.
I need the ability to change the core dump flags anytime.
