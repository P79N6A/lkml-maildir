What is (long)(a-b) ? I have tried to look it up in the C99 standeard but 
I can't find it. Maybe it is in the referred LIA-1 standeard, which I 
can't find with google.
I think the best would be to use "a-b > ULONG_MAX/2" when you mean "a<b" 
as that should be completely portable.
According to C99 Appendix H2.2 
(
http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf
) an 
implementation can choose to do modulo signed integers as it is 
mandatory for unsigned integers. If an implementation have choosen 
to do that it must be a bug to to do the "a-b < 0" -> "a<b" optimization.
I have never experienced a compiler/architecture combination _not_ doing 
wrapped signed integers.
