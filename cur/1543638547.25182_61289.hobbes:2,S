Actually I'm quite fond of my data so I'd prefer to leave them present.
2.4.19 knows about the onboard video corner case which 2.4.18 didnt.
The tdfx one I can't help on. Although if its X that is making a mess
probably there is an interaction between XFree86 and the kernel driver
that wants looking at by both parties to see what code is forgetting to 
restore what values
