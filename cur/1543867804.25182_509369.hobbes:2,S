Yeah. Given TS_USEDFPU set, before move_user_context():
CPU  => FPUc
NTSK => FPUn
OTSK => FPUo
After move_user_context():
CPU  => FPUc
NTSK => FPUo
OTSK => FPUn
After the incoming __unlazy_fpu() in __switch_to():
CPU  => FPUc
NTSK => FPUo
OTSK => FPUc
After the first fault in NTSK:
CPU  => FPUo
NTSK => FPUo
OTSK => FPUc
So NTSK loads a non up2date FPUo, instead of the FPUc that was the "dirty" 
context to migrate (since TS_USEDFPU was set).
I think you need an early __unlazy_fpu() in that case.
