I'm hoping this is just a "let's see if the behavior changes" patch, not 
something that you think should be applied if it fixes something?
This patch looks like it is trying to paper over (rather than fix) some 
possible bug in the "->disable" logic. Makes sense as a "let's see if it's 
that" kind of thing, but not as a "let's fix it".
Or am I missing something?
