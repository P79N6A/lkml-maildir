Actually with Coda we've got 2 inodes that have an identical i_mapping.
The Coda inode's i_mapping is set to point to the hosting inode's
i_data. Hmm, I should probably set it to the i_mapping of the host
inode that way I can run Coda over a Coda(-like) filesystem.

But Coda has 2 inodes, which one are you connecting to whose superblock.
My guess is that it would be correct to add inode->i_mapping->host to
inode->i_mapping->host->i_sb, which will be the underlying inode in
Coda's case, but host isn't guaranteed to be an inode, it just happens
to be an inode in all existing situations.

Coda's inodes don't have to get dirtied because we never write them out,
although the associated dirty pages do need to hit the disk eventually :)
