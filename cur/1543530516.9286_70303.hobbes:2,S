Just for the record, cathedral style of development is indeed
open-source. There's nothing in the open-source definition that says
you can't do cathedral style development. Indeed, in The Cathedral and
The Bazaar ESR characterizes the FSF's development practices as
cathedral style development, and while he's critical of their
practices, he doesn't even begin to suggest they aren't doing
open-source development.

It's not like you can say someone's "development" is not open source and
the end result is not open source. Reread the open-source
definition. It's very clear that one is not required to publish all
development, merely that software can't be distributed without the
source. Donald, and many other open-source developers, does not
release his software until he's ready, and that's fine. As I said
before, most FSF software has followed this development cycle.
If you read The Cathedral and The Bazaar more carefully, you'll see
that ESR specifically suggests it's a good idea not to release
software until it's reached the stage of "plausible promise". From the
sounds of it, this is exactly what Donald has done. He's sat down,
thought about a design, and when he's got it ironed out enough that he
knows it's a good idea, he releases it. When he releases stuff, it's
not a fait accompli, I'm sure he expects people to find bugs in what
he's doing (I sure would ;-). However, if he were to release software
before he'd ironed out in his own mind how the software worked, he's
not likely to get a lot of interest/support.
Sometimes, it's useful to have good architecture. Certainly, in the
area of network drivers, Linux's history has been spotty. The design
of the networking layer has, in whole or in part, had to be redone a
few times. This should suggest that if someone wants to do the design
right, it might take them a while before they've thought it out enough
that it's ready to be released to the outside world. I don't begrudge
Donald one bit for doing so.
There does come a time when things need to be rewritten from scratch,
and when that happens, sending small patch files just isn't
possible. (Indeed, if small patch files were possible I'm sure by now
someone would have taken Donald's posted code, broken it up into
patches, and sent them to Linus.) I can understand why Linus might not
want to throw in a huge update into the kernel all of a sudden, but I
think it's unfortunate that some of the 100's of eyeballs out there
don't take a look at Donald's designs and try to understand them
before they prematurely dump them and come up with a quick hack.
