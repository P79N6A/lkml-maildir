Right.  I think device addition/removal is infrequent enough that 
either SRCU or and rwsem could be used, without any significant 
slowdown.

But an rwsem _doesn't_ obtain the same effect.  The major difference is
that holding all the device semaphores blocks binding of drivers, which
we need to prevent during suspend.  A minor difference is that it won't
prevent adding a new device, since you don't need to hold any existing
semaphores before calling device_add().

That was the idea: First acquire the rwsem write lock so that all
existing calls to device_add will have finished and new ones will fail,
and then acquire all the semaphores.
The purpose of holding all the semaphores is not to prevent device
addition.  More like the other way around: In order to be sure of
holding _all_ the semaphores, we have to prevent new devices from being
added.

No it won't.  If it calls device_add from within its suspend method,
the down_read_trylock will fail and the call will return immediately.  
With a WARN_ON to let people know which driver tried to do device_add
at an illegal time.

That's why we need the rwsem.

For USB devices, writes to the /sys/.../bConfigurationValue node will
call usb_set_configuration(), which registers child devices.  We don't
want these calls to fail because a suspend is underway, since suspends 
are supposed to be transparent to userspace.  So they need to block 
until the suspend is over.
Access (either read or write) to any sysfs node which actually touches 
the device hardware will fail while the device is suspended.  Again, 
for transparency such accesses should block.

It isn't necessary if the callbacks aren't needed (i.e., if we give
methods a way to unregister their attribute directly).  But if we do
keep the callbacks, then for safety's sake their workqueue should be
freezable.
