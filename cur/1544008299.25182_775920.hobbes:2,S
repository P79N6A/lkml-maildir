I agree, this can be shown with:
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
	unsigned int i, count = 10;
	printf ("The original loop:\n");
        for (i = count-1; i >= 0; i--) {
		printf ("%u, ", i);
		if (i == -1) {
			printf ("which is wrong.\n");
			break;
		}
	}
        printf ("As suggested by Bill:\n");
	for (i = count; i--; )
		printf ("%u, ", i);
	printf ("...After the loop i=%u\n");
	printf ("Your suggestion:\n");
	i = count;
	while (i--)
		printf ("%u, ", i);
	printf ("...After the loop i=%u\n");
	return 0;
}

Ok, with me. As also shown this will give the same results:
