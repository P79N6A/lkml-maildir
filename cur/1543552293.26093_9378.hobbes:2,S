The AmigaOS (as I remember it from my past days) was fast because it
had no memory protection between user and kernel space at all. So you
could simply pass around message pointers without copying any data
from kernel to user space.
Yeah. Cool. Fast. Crashed like hell all the time you made one false
move. 
Please, go and play with the other CS undergrads on Hurd. Or climb a
tree.
