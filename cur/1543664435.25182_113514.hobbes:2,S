It's looking pretty good Ingo.
- The "tbench starves everything else" problem is fixed.
- The mm_struct leak is fixed
- As far as I can tell, the scheduler update no longer causes the
  large "contest io_load" changes, wherein the streaming write made
  lots more progress at the expense of the kernel compile.
- The longstanding problem wherein a kernel build makes my X desktop
  unusable is 90% fixed - it is still possible to trigger stalls, but
  they are less severe, and you actually have to work at it a bit to
  make them happen.
Thanks.
