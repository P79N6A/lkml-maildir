Nope.

__BASE_FILE__ is not useful.
Remember: when we have a BUG in a header file, we need to get the HEADER
file, not the base file.
__BASE_FILE__ only works for .c files.
And .c files aren't the problem anyway (ie if we didn't have BUG()
statements in header files, we wouldn't have problems anyway).
