USB serial drivers could be implemented in userspace given a 2.6 version
of Rogier Wolff's userspace serial patch:
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0303.1/att-1075/01-patch-2.4.20.trueport-12-mrt
We currently have a lot of USB drivers in the kernel that could be 
implemented in userspace. I'm thinking of drivers/usb/image, misc, and
serial particularly. If there was a userspace API to do for video
capture what SANE does for scanners, drivers/usb/media would be mostly
unneeded as well.
If vendors noticed that this was possible, we'd probably get more binary
userspace drivers for USB devices. I pass no judgement here as to
whether this would be good or bad.
