I think Andrea was thinking more of the case of the anonymous IO
generator, and having the "controller" program thgat keeps the socket
always in CORK mode, but uses SIOCPUSH when it doesn't know what teh
future access patterns will be. 
Basically, it could use SIOCPUSH whenever its request queue is empty,
instead of uncorking (and re-corking when the next request comes in).
Again, the actual data _senders_ may not be aware of the network issues.
They are the worker bees, and they may not know or care that they are
pushing out data to the network. 
Ingo, you should realize that people actually _want_ to use things like
stdio. Not everything is a Tux web-server. There are specialized servers
out there, and there are tons of people who prefer to use "fprintf()"
and letting the library handle buffering etc.
Very few people want to use send() directly.
Mantra: "everything is a stream of bytes". Repeat until enlightened.
