I just re-read Edgar Toernig's comment... oh yeah.
Contemplate BOTH parts of the utmp quote:
: char ut_id[4];     /* init id or abbrev. ttyname */
: ...
: xterm(1) and other terminal emulators directly create
: a USER_PROCESS record and generate the ut_id by using
: the last two letters of /dev/ttyp%c or by using p%d
: for /dev/pts/%d. If they find a DEAD_PROCESS for this
: id, they recycle it, otherwise they create a new entry.
The utmp or utmpx record is about 1/2 a kilobyte.
The records get added to a file. They only get
recycled when the tty is recycled.
So that's a 20 bit minor, 9 bits of utmpx record size...
and thus a file that grows to half a gigabyte.
The reasons are adding up quickly:
1. half-gigabyte utmp,wtmp,wtmpx,utmpx file
2. breaks ut_id, even if 1000 ptys not used
3. a pain to type ("ps -t 1018493")
4. screws up column widths (ps, w, top...)
5. breaks old dev_t, even if 256 ttys not used
