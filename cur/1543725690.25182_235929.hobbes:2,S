The 2.4.18 kernel source in Debian stable in has at about 300kB patches 
applied (gzip'ed 60kB), and many of them fix security bugs that were 
reported since 2.4.18 was released.

OTOH, distributions might have to ship more kernel versions and provide 
security updates for more kernels if features in newer 2.6 kernels break 
architectures or subarchitectures they support.
