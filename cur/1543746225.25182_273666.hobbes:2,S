	I think you're right.  I did have a problem with the
test that you suggested.  I think I may be able to accomodate
the problem though.
	I had not realized that file->f_dentry will keep the dentry
around even after the file has been removed, at which point
file->f_dentry->d_fsdata will point to garbage rather than a
valid sysfs_direntry.  This is a problem in fs/sysfs/file.c
where sysfs_read_file calls fill_read_buffer, which calls to_attr,
which tries to read sysfs_direnty->s_element.
	I believe I can avoid the need for any of the IO routines
to access sysfs_direntry->s_element by having create_file()
put a copy in inode->u.generic_ip.  If it works, I will send
you an updated patch.  However, it may be a day before I can
do it.

	I believe that, with the patch I posted, the sysfs_dirent
is still removed from the list of the parent directory's children
at exactly the same times as before.

	No need.  I hope to have an updated patch for you soon though.
Thanks for the quick and detailed response.
