Nasty.
But why does i386/UP work?

Better would be to undo the cpumask_t changes in io_apic.c
and go back to unsigned long masks there again.
Obviously a cpu mask is not the right data structure to manage APICs
Another way would be to do whatever i386 does to avoid the problem.
The IO-APIC code is unfortunately quite out of date/unsynced compared to i386,
maybe it just needs some bug fix ported over. I will check that later.
