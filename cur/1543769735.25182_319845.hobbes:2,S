Hnngh! Missing dependencies (do the package format support it at all?), 
no splitting (why should I need apache2 for the portability library 
libapr?), odd things like needing sunfreeware gzip instead of the 
solaris one in some packages (something that you don't notice until its 
too late)... its like going way back in time to slackware.
