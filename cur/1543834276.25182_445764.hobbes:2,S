Thanks, but it doesn't work. I tried this reboot patch - nothing changed.
Also grepping in dmesg searching "machine_reset" after applying debug
patch gave no results.
This bug is about acpi, but as I said my problem exists even when I
compile kernel without acpi. Maybe I should post my own bug on bugzilla? 
I don't have any idea what to check next.
