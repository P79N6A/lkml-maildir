	No, pthreads changed that, from my understanding.  linuxthreads did
it all in one thing w/o ever actually calling the kernel 'clone'.  pthreads
properly calles 'clone' and therefore each thread gets it's own PID and as
such can be scheduled on any CPU.  (Well, that's not the direct reason, but
you know what I mean).

	Solaris implemented it kernel-level to begin with.  The first
threading in Linux was done all in user-space, IIRC.  Which meant that it
couldn't because a single process (to the kernel) won't get multiple CPUs.
