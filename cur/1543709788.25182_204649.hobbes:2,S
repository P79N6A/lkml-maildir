I don't want to have us start talking in circles.  As someone else pointed out
there's the time issues along with the uid/gid.  Both are admittedly only
broken in corner cases not typically seen in the average server.

The 'last' tool seems to have, at a minimum, some formatting issues.  I don't
think anyone would have noticed since most distros seem to use the one bundled
with sysvinit, instead.  The dump-utmp utility seems to share the problem in
that it doesn't print out completely useable/parseable output.

Gotcha.  I'll shut up, now.  ;-)

I'm just being pendantic.  I completely agree that a field with no predefined
range has to be capped.  However, as a sys-admin I would say that I would
still find such long windows useful if someone was complaining about an
outtage for a service that basically only gets stopped/restarted during system
reboots.  You could easily see what the history of interruptions would be for
those services.

I'll wait as well. I'm very eager to see (at least) the uid issue resolved so
I don't have to keep hacking up kernel/glibc headers on new deployments.
