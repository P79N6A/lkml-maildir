The problem I see with this whole maturity levels idea is that you've
missed that 'EXPERIMENTAL' is largely a complete failure because
everyone ends up enabling it due to needing something dependant on it.
People just don't care about how mature an option is if they need
a driver/feature.  *No-one* is going to come across options and think 
"Oh, the driver for my network card isn't stable. Guess I'll not enable it".
And the idea of hiding the options behind multiple levels of
maturity options sounds completely batshit.
Introducing multiple levels of EXPERIMENTAL is just introducing
more symbols of zero value because everyone will end up enabling
them just to get things done.
