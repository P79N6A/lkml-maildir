This is becoming a FAQ... see net/core/dev.c, line 907 on 2.5:
    /* skb->nh should be correctly
       set by sender, so that the second statement is
       just protection against buggy protocols.
     */
    skb2->mac.raw = skb2->data;
    if (skb2->nh.raw < skb2->data || skb2->nh.raw > skb2->tail) {
            if (net_ratelimit())
                    printk(KERN_DEBUG "protocol %04x is buggy, dev %s\n",
			   skb2->protocol, dev->name);
            skb2->nh.raw = skb2->data;
    }
