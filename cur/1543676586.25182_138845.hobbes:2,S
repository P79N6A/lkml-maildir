Wow, thanks for the pointer!  I just visited the Buffalo site 
    
http://www.buffalo-technology.com/
and I could not find any source code.  And not only are they
distributing the linux kernel and BusyBox, their rom is
_remarkably_ similar to the Linksys one in many respects.
Perhaps they share an upstream vendor that did not make them
aware of their responsibilities?
Here is a script I just whipped up to open up their firmware...
    #!/bin/sh
    wget 
http://www.buffalo-technology.com/download/firmware/wbr-113b.exe
    # Next I used wine (20030408) to extract the content
    wine wbr-113b.exe
    # Move into the directory into which the firmware was extracted
    cd Wbr_1.13b
    # I noticed a GZIP signature for a file named "piggy" at offset
    # 62 bytes from the start, suggesting we have a compressed Linux
    # kernel
    dd if=wbrbg-113b bs=62 skip=1 | zcat > kernel
    # Noticed there was a cramfs magic signature at offset 786466
    dd if=wbrbg-113b of=cramfs.image bs=786466 skip=1
    file cramfs.image
    sudo mount -o loop,ro -t cramfs ./cramfs.image /mnt 
    ls -la /mnt/bin
    file /mnt/bin/busybox
    strings /mnt/bin/busybox | grep BusyBox
    /usr/i386-linux-uclibc/bin/i386-uclibc-ldd /mnt/bin/busybox
It seems my Dad will have another letter to mail out in the
morning!
