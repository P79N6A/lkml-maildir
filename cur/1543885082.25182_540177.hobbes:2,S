Sure. I meant that linux/screen_info.h should already be safe.

Interesting. I missed that one.

Yep, a real pain.
At this point it looks like a bug in kexec to me, and the bzImage loader
which is the primary way to boot linux doesn't have this problem.  Yea.

And now you understand why I am surveying these things and want to get
the 32bit entry point well documented.  So the situation doesn't get worse.
Frankly while I consider what we are doing pretty sane I have always considered
the 32bit entry point at least partly experimental.  But we have enough users
of it now and enough reasons to have users of it, that it looks like we need to
do things a little more methodically.

True.  For small little extensions we have room.  For big things probably
not.
