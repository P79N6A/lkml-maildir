Hi 
I'm using the preemptible kernel patch since 2.4.10 
(no 2.4.11). And it makes a big difference on 486 with
12Megs of ram. 
I can't send you benchmarks (i don't have time for
this but if you really want one ... it can be arranged
:-)). 
But:
When I run a configure script I can actually see it
running (without this patch it is very slow).
The coolest thing was that I could run Gnome and KDE
(with loadavg of 4 and waiting 2 to 4 minutes for an
application to start (because of ram I think))
something not possible without the preemtible kernel.
I don't swear after them anyway.( I prefer fvwm)
Compilation is much faster (i'll make a benchmark
compiling linux kernel -- i promise :-)) ).
The system is stable with high system loads.
Now is kernel 2.4.12 and no problems at all.
Any chance to be in the main stable kernel ?
Bye
