Yeah, I even remade the file systems on both drives and got the same
result.  
After moving the drives around on the Promise controller and moving 1
drive back to the MB IDE port, it looks like all drives are running at
high speed.  I dunno - it's weird.  I wouldn't be surprised if one of
the drives arbitrarily reverts back to the slower speed at some point
or after a future reboot, though it hasn't yet.
I was thinking maybe burst mode was not getting turned on, not working,
or getting turned off on some of the Promise ports for some reason.
vmstat reports KB/sec.
