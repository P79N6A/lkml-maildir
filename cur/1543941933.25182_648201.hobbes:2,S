I could reproduce the slow-down by a loop of socat commands. The dump you 
sent looks exactly like the traces I got at dumping the traffic generated by 
socat and that is good.
Actively closed connections are not handled properly, i.e. the initiator 
of the active close should not be taken into account. So could you give a 
try to the patch below? Does it just suppress the 'invalid packed ignored' 
and all other kernel messages or both suppresses them and produces normal 
printing speed?

    Handle active close for both sides, it is not restricted
    to one side alone.
