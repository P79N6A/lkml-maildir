please don't. These kind of abbreviations make my brain tilt. For the
directory name you basically should use the full name. In this case it
will be drivers/ieee1394/ or drivers/firewire/. Nothing else is really
acceptable and if you look at other subsystems, you will see that they
always use the long name.
For the exported public functions you might wanna use abbreviations, but
in general I don't recommend it. And normally we only talk about a
limited functions that are needed to be exposed via EXPORT_SYMBOL.
Regards
Marcel
