I believe it does a lot worse things.  It actually reads a picture file 
for example, then resizes the picture down to an icon sized one and then 
displays the icon, then on to the next file and for text files it 
displays the beginning of the text file in the icon, etc...  Totally 
unnecessary and brings total slowdown.  But of course as with Windows 
Explorer this is configurable and you can just use list view without 
icons...
