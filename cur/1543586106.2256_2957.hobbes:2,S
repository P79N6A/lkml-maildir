Notice that this is not 100% solution. APM is async, and you might already
did few wrong delays by the time apm event is delivered to you.
Also notice that at least my toshiba goes low speed (150MHz) on
*) batteries going low
*) overheat
It goes back to 300MHz at ac power. Another crazy thing: it goes down to
35MHz on extreme overheat -- that's factor of 10 change.
