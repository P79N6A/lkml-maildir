Actually, in 2.4 we have one big VM balancing problem left.
We have no way to auto-balance between refill_inactive_scan()
and swap_out(), so we can (and probably do) still end up paging
out the wrong pages lots of times ... this is alleviated somewhat
by having a 1-second inactive list, but still...
Another problem is a lack of smarter IO clustering, when we get
that better I'm sure we can increase performance even more.
regards,
Rik
