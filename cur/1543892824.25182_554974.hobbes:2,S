Hi Trent,

Tracking the flexcop, I've arrived on a similar patch to yours, but this
approach will duplicate some debug macros. This is somewhat ugly. Since
we need this fix for a late -rc, I think that the better for now is to
use an optional code on Makefile that will add flexcop-dma to
b2c2-flexcop only if flexcop pci support is selected. The end result is
very simple, and will solve the issue.
The final patch is this one:

Cheers,
Mauro
