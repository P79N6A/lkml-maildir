I don't know. Right now no part of the kernel knows about SO_ORIGINAL_DST;
it is a feature of the NAT part of Rusty's netfilter package, which is
seperately distributed. Unless the intent is to distribute that package
along with the kernel, putting the #define into kernel headers seems wrong.
On the other hand, if SO_ORIGINAL_DST were declared an integral part of
the kernel IP implementation, that would be OK. In that case, what about
making the SOL_IP handling code provide a standard implementation returning
the same thing as getsockname(), and allowing the netfilter getsockopt
handling to override that handler? i.e. make the netfilter option registration
code aware of a 'DECLINE' return value, call the nf_sockopt() code before the
switch in ip_getsockopt(), and run the standard options (now including
SO_ORIGINAL_DST) if the nf handler returned e.g. -ENOPROTOPT.
I'll cook up a patch for that way to run things. If it proves acceptable,
we might want to extract the "register another sockopt" stuff out of
netfilter into a more generic location.
While we're here: right now, SO_ORIGINAL_DST is implemented in the NAT
part of the netfilter code, using information stored in the (supposedly)
seperate ip_conntrack module. Furthermore, a special check is made
for the protocol being TCP. I think it would be more intuitive if the
ip_conntrack module itself were the implementor of SO_ORIGINAL_DST,
and it would implement it regardless of protocol. Is that feasible?

Huh? Could you explain that, maybe in private email? I was under the
impression that with the old transproxy stuff, an ordinary getsockopt()
would return "the right thing".
