I've been experiencing mysterious lockups since upgrading to kernel
2.4.17.  Looking in the /var/log/messages I hadn't seen anything
suspicious until now.  I guess the machine hasn't had time to write this
to disk except every now and then.  The message
Feb 19 11:29:55 butler kernel: st0: Block limits 1 - 16777215 bytes.
I notice this after rebooting after the crash.  So I tried manually
doing a tar to the tape drive and was able to successfully lock the
machine up.  Can someone help me understand this and if it is simply a
limit problem, why would the machine lock up?
Thank you.
