My alpha is running 2.4.4aa3 under very high load (apache beaten from ab
in loop via 100mbit switched network [tulip on the alpha] plus cerberus)
and I didn't had any problem so far (it only deadlocked with OOM after
one day of day of tux [instead of apache] + cerberus regression testing
but that's only because of a memleak in tux that I reproduced on x86 too
it seems)
I'm going to release soon a 2.4.5pre1aa1 that will compile with modules
as well. The only annoying thing is that UP kernel compiles seems not to
boot but I hope that will be fixed soon too.
So I doubt the problem is the tcp stack, it may not be the driver but it
shouldn't be a generic bug in vanilla 2.4.4 at least.
