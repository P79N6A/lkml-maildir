Actually, I guess we could define this to be the same point
where we'd end up freeing memory in order to satisfy our
allocation.
This would result in __GFP_FAIL meaning "give me memory if
it's available, but don't waste time freeing memory if we
don't have enough free memory now".
Space-wise these semantics could change (say, pages_low
vs. pages_min), but they'll stay the same when you look at
"how hard to try" or "how much effort to spend".
regards,
Rik
