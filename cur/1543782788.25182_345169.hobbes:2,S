I don't see why the above change was necessary?  Why not stick with the
current more flexible sizing option?
Note that the RADIX_TREE_MAP_FULL trick can still be used.  It just has to
be put inside a `for (idx = 0; idx < RADIX_TREE_TAG_LONGS; idx++)' loop,
which will vanish if RADIX_TREE_TAG_LONGS==1.
