    Actually I had another thought.  There is an even easier way of doing
things now.   When I cleaned up the queueing code, a lot of the similar code
between sd and sr got moved into scsi_lib.c.   Thus teaching sr.c to handle
writes would be quite trivial.  Mainly adjusting sr_init_command() to
generate a WRITE_10 if the command is a write and the device has the
writable flag set.
    There are a couple of places where it tries to ensure that access is
read-only (possibly in sr_open)  These would need to be modified so that
they check the writable flag first.
