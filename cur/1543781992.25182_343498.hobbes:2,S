Introducing another device-specific IOCTL because the other device-specific
request turned out to be wrong is likely to be wrong, too.

The parameter value should IMHO be a pointer to a struct {
 unsigned long long maxspeed; // (with 0 being the magic max. value?)
 int facility; /* 0=general speed, 2=general read, 4=read data,
                  6=read audio, 8=read raw ... whatever is supported
                  n+1 = s/read/write/ */
}
That will work for any device and speed you can expect in the near future.

EINVAL?
