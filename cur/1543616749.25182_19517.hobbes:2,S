Ok, everyone agrees that mlockall() should not grow VM_GROWSDOWN
segments to their maximum size.
Should the page fault handler fill the hole created by
void * grow_stack(void)
{
	char data[100000];
	data[0] = '0';
	return data;
}
The principle of least surprise would mean filling holes, but OTHO sane
apps would use memset(data,0,sizeof(data)).
