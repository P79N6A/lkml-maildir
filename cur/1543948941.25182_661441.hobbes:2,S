Hi all,
I have created today's linux-next tree at
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sfr/linux-next.git.
You can see which trees have been included by looking in the Next/Trees
file in the source.  There are also quilt-import.log and merge.log files
in the Next directory.  Between each merge, the tree was built with
allmodconfig for both powerpc and x86_64.
There were only two merge problems - notifications have been sent.
We are up to 39 trees, more are welcome (even if they are currently
empty).
Status of my local build tests is at
http://kisskb.ellerman.id.au/kisskb/branch/9/.
  If maintainers want to
give advice about cross compilers/configs that work, we are always open
to add more builds.
Also, the linux-next tree is being build/boot tested by the guys at
test.kernel.org.  Thanks to them.
This tree include Willy's semaphore updates.
