Let me guess: you're a lawyer? :-)
This is a very strange definition: if someone makes a change such that
their machine can no longer communicate with existing systems, I would say
the person making the incompatible change is the one who broke it.

pouring water over them causes problems, even if the standards say the
socket should be waterproof!
