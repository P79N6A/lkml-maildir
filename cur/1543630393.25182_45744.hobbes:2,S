An alternative way to think about the ia64 model is that it provides
"ordering" variables.  Accesses to those variables won't be reordered
by the compiler or the CPU and also order other (normally unordered
accesses).  One way to support this is have an ORDERING attribute for
variables (which would expand into "volatile" on ia64).  This would
have to be complemented by a set of barrier routines which will
achieve the desired ordering on machines that don't have the
acquire/release model of ia64 (and on ia64, they would expand into
nothing).
