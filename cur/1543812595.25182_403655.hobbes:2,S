Hmm, in my tree sd.o has no switch in the init function. But that does
not change your point which is valid indeed.

For the same reason references to .init.text from .rodata are not warned
upon - there are simply too many compielr generated false positives.
Following is the original comment from reference_init.pl:
* Unfortunately references to read only data that referenced .init
* sections had to be excluded. Almost all of these are false
* positives, they are created by gcc. The downside of excluding rodata
* is that there really are some user references from rodata to
* init code, e.g. drivers/video/vgacon.c:
*
* const struct consw vga_con = {
*        con_startup:            vgacon_startup,
*
* where vgacon_startup is __init.  If you want to wade through
* the false
* positives, take out the check for rodata.
And this is unfortunate since we cannot do a full check, but we do a
better job than before and warn for many of the trivial cases.
Judging the amount of warnings already generated this is worth checking.
