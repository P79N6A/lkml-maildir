It does.  Any 32-bit process trying to run a signal handler when it had
used the FPU, would clobber "current" with FP bits.  The observed failure
mode was shortly after this in the signal handler setup code, when it
crashed due to current->mm being zero (current->pid also being zero, and
the whole first 512 bytes of the task_struct being garbage).
Thanks,
Roland
