No. No flags. That's the mistake SCSI did, and it is a fundamental
mistake. It makes it basically impossible to "shift out" old code.
I'd much rather have two separate functions for this - sure, they can
share most of the code by using common inline functions and what not, but
I'd be a lot happier with drivers just using the function that they are
most comfortable with directly.
Anyway, this is not a change I'd like to have at this point. This is
definitely a 2.5.x thing.

Yes. But like rd_make_request(), it only does so from the CPU, not from
any real device (obviously). So it doesn't actually need to create a
_physical_ bounce-buffer the way a real device needs to that does DMA etc.
It can just use the same "kmap()" functionality that all the other generic
kernel code uses. 
Real devices are special. We don't know what they will end up doing, and
some (many) of them actually care deeply about the physical address as
opposed to just wanting to have the CPU able to touch the page.

I agree with that notion. I don't think your patch was a bad one. I just
think that it would make it a more straightforward operation later when we
_do_ start to make it aware of clever devices to not do it the way you
did.
