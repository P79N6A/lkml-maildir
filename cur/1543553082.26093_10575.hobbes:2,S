The fact power management even handling is completely broken and crashes
on unfortunately timed module unloads doesnt count ?
More importantly has the bug when you can use the proc/self/mem trick with read
to crash machines as any user via svgalib stuff been fixed ?
Questions:
	Has the O_SYNC stuff been fixed so that more than ext2 honours this
	flag ?
	What about the fact anyone can crash a box using ioctls on net
	devices and waiting for an unload - was this fixed ?
Less Critical:
	Does autofs4 work yet
	Why haven't you merged irda changes people have been sending for months 	which mean irda in 2.4test doesnt work ?
	Making ramfs work seems to not be merged
Ok so Im always on the more conservative side but the large collection of
'fixe exists isnt merged' and those 4 or 5 other issues to me count as at the
very least alarm bells.
But I have to admit it seems close to 2.4.0. Its stayed up a lot better than
I expected under load once I fixed the scsi one
