I already gave you my opinion on such code. There is no need for it. If 
your servers are loaded, in the same way you bump NFILES (and likely 
even other default configs), you bump up max_user_instances:
$ echo NN > /proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_instances
It requires no extra crud in the kernel, and it works pretty darn good.
