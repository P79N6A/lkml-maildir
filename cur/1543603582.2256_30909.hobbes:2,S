Are you otherwise interested in machines seeing this problem? I have a 
candidate. I'm running a SuperMicro 370DL3 with a Seagate ST320423A. For the 
sake of simplicity I turned off DMA and filled the whole drive full of 
zeroes. I see data corruption (non-zero data) on an otherwise inactive 
machine just reading the drive back with "od", if I have DMA on with some 
settings (udma2 in particular fails). Currently I'm using just kernel 2.4.9, 
but if it would be useful I could run tests with kernels of your choosing.
