This may not be needed.  If I understand things correctly, the system
won't suspsend until all tasks have returned from system calls and end
up in the refrigerator.  So if a memory migration is  running when
someone tries to suspend the system, the suspend won't
occur until the memory migration system call returns.
Is that correct?
What happens if a system call calls schedule() (or otherwise gets blocked,
e. g. by trying to obtain a semaphore?)
