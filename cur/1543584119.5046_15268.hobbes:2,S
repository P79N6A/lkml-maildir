For this (but not for other "proper thread support" things you mention)
would it be enough to have /proc publish some token that represent unique
->fs, ->mm, etc pointers?  (The kernel-space address of each would work,
though that might be leaking too much info; the least userspace must treat
such values as opaque canary tokens.)  This does not give you the most
efficient "ps --threads 231" but it does let ps, top, (fuser?), etc group
processes with the same vm, files, etc, no?  ...I'm kinda surprised such a
thing doesn't already exist actually.  Unless of course, it does exist, but
is not enough :-P
