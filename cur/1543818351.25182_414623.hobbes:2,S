Subject: [PATCH] Staircase cpu scheduler v15 for 2.6.17-rc1*
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Patches for the current staircase cpu scheduler (v15) for 2.6.17-rc1 are here:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/ck/patches/staircase/2.6.17-rc1/2.6.17-rc1-staircase-15.patch
and for mm2 here:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/ck/patches/staircase/2.6.17-rc1/2.6.17-rc1-mm2/2.6.17-rc1-mm2-staircase-15.patch
Martin Bligh was kind enough to put the current version of staircase on 
2.6.17-rc1 for testing on 
http://test.kernel.org/
Performance more or less parallels mainline 2.6.17-rc1 (apart from 
interactivity as shown here previously where staircase mostly trumps 
mainline).
Jens Axboe was also kind enough to do a kernbench run on 4xIA64 which also 
showed no performance difference. See 
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.ck/5472
 (the 2nd run is staircase 
and the attachments seem to be listed twice by gmane)
Just as a reminder of how much less code than the ever increasing complexity 
mainline scheduler staircase is, here is a diffstat of the patch for 
2.6.17-rc1-mm2:
 fs/proc/array.c       |    4 
 include/linux/sched.h |   20 -
 kernel/exit.c         |    1 
 kernel/sched.c        |  987
