    I have an IBM deskstar IDE 25gb HD.
    I get nothing but trouble when trying to install it.
    What to do?
When asking such questions on the kernel list, always give
kernel version, kernel boot messages involving the disk
(dmesg | grep hdd) and the output of both hdparm -i and hdparm -I.
    I should report in hdparm (CHS) 16383,16,63 but i only get
    4096,16,63 ~= 2gb. When i force the 16383,16,63 setup (which
    the label states)
Maybe you misunderstand something. A disk that is larger than 8.4 GB
must according to ATA specs report its geometry as 16383/16/63.
This is not something you have to do.
Indeed, the only thing you could achieve is that you force the
disk to 8.4 GB, which is probably not what you want.
The less you say about the geometry the better chances are that
all is fine.
    i get
    Sep  8 19:25:58 ey kernel: end_request: I/O error, dev 16:41 (hdd), sector
    4129228
    when i format the drive with mke2fs -c /dev/hdd.
    The largedisk howto states that it has to report 16383,16,63 for
    the kernel to recognize that it's bigger than the 8gb BIOS limit...
No, that is not what the largedisk howto says.
    When i give the geometry as bootparam it still doesn't work.
Start by giving the kernel boot messages, they tell clearly what is
happening.
In case you know the model, say DJNA-352500, then we probably know
the actual size, say 25590620160 bytes, which is 49585/16/63.
THe kernel boot messages will also tell you the size (but in "binary"
megabytes and gigabytes, beware!)
