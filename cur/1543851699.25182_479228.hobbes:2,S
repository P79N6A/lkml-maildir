I was thinking about this a bit, and it would seem that not having get/set
function pretty much kills the reson to have generic pointer structures at
all.
Would it make sense to change filesystems like ecryptfs to open-code all
these things instead of using _their own_ get/set functions (e.g.,
ecryptfs_inode_to_lower)?
Other posibility is to move the lower pointers into generic VFS objects in
some clever way (not to waste memory on regular filesystems) - this way, the
stackable filesystems can still share some parts.
