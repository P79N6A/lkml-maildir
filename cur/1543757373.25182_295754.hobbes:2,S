In many cases, you might have added the resume= line to every kernel
that's booted (eg, LILO's global append= parameter, or Debian GRUB's
magic kopts gear). Alternately (or additionally), you could examine
the signature when sys_swapon is called on a swap partition (though
the code couldn't be __init then).
These together I want to claim would catch many of these cases, and
any effort to avoid severe filesystem corruption is a good thing.
Bernard.
