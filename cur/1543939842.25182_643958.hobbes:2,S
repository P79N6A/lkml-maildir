Hi Bart,
after a lot of hammering ide-tape got pimped pretty considerably (ca. 600 lines
shorter and slicker :)). I'm sure there's more to be done like, e.g. replacing
the BKL in idetape_write_release() with finer-grained locking etc, probably also
some pipeline improvements, removal of OnStream support, etc. but that'll come
later.
