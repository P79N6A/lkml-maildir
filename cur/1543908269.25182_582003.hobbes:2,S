I think this problem is caused by the lirc_serial module, because if I
try to modprobe the lirc_serial module I get this error:
kobject_add failed for lirc_serial.0 with -EEXIST, don't try to
register things whith the same name in the same directory.
kobject_shadow_add
kobject_set_name
device_add
platform_device_add
init_module
sys_init_module
prio_tree_insert
sysenter_past_esp
But I don't understand why it happens...
Have you any idea?
Thank you very much! :-)
