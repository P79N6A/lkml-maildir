I think two things are missing:
1) We should make sure there are not PF_NOFREEZE tasks running when a CPU
is removed (when one is added probably too).  For this purpose we can add a
parameter to freeze_processes() that will tell it to ignore PF_NOFREEZE, but
at the same time we'll have to change all kernel threads that set PF_NOFREEZE
to call try_to_freeze() anyway.  I can do that, but it will take me a couple of
days.
2) We have to change the PM code to stop using CPU hotplug for disabling
nonboot CPUs. ;-)
Greetings,
Rafael
