All modern devices implement word53 and the above code probably never 
runs in your case.

This seems more like a hardware problem to me.

There have been a series of read errors on LBA 0x20cbc about five hours 
before the smart log was dumped.  The error status as seen by the drive 
is uncorrectable media error at LBA 0x20cbc.  The failing command is 
READ for LBA 0x20c2f, so the drive could read some sectors but not all 
of them.  Maybe the command times out while the drive keeps retrying read.
Hmmm.. errors in smart log and dmesg don't have matching LBAs.  So, it's 
possible that those failed read and the command timeouts are unrelated. 
  Please keep watching and report.  We need more info to determine 
what's going on.
