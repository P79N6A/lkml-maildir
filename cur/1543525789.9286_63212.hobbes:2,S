I think Larry's description (below) about how STP works is pretty
much accurate modulo 'various levels of details / mechanisms' but
hey, thats what protocol spec's are for :-)
http://www.hippi.org/cST.html
The STP Long Message Transfer stuff is realized to be useful for
network enabled storage - may it be through higher performance
solutions in the upper layer - NFS/BDS etc., or via the lower layers
like SCSI over STP.
What I'd like to add is, that STP also specifies persistent (longer
duration - spanning multiple messages) mappings and pinning down of
memory which is useful for low latency communications a'la clustering
applications. Again, what STP offers here is an open, media-independent
and scalable protocol.
Are there any other applications that people can forsee?
thanks,
