isdn4k-utils-3.0beta1's ipppd (Or ANY ipppd) needs a short patch to
allow for the extra-version in 2.2.0-pre?. It chokes on the pre?, and
defaults to 2.0.x. Look into sys-linux.c in the ipppd source and comment
out the following code in the decode_version function:
     if (*buf != '\0')
      {
        *version      =
        *modification =
        *patch        = 0;
      }
This will allow you to dial in. This is NOT a problem with the kernel ISDN
code, but a buggy version decoding.
(I'm currently using an unpatched 2.2.0-pre9 with a modified isdn4k-utils
to dial in, so it definately does work)

I really thank Microsoft(TM) for encouraging manufacturers to label their
