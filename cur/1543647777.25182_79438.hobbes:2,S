It is not OK if the function is run by a different process.  Then one
process will have a preempt_count one larger than it should and one
would have a preempt_count one smaller.
The task with the one smaller preempt_count will probably cause a crash
when it preemptively reschedules erroneously.
In other words, you have:
	Process A		Process B
	preempt_count++
				preempt_count--
When both of those routines need to be done by the same process.
Also, you cannot use spin_lock_irqsave() in different functions at all
on sparc as it contains stack information.
