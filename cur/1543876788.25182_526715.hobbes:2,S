That's probably debatable, but ok.
I would be opposed for adding another page per process at least
because the per process memory footprint in Linux is imho already
too large.

But how would that mix with the OpenMP use case where you have
thread pools that normally don't make decisions afer startup, but 
just stay around? I think for those you would need events of some sort
to start or remove threads as needed. 
Asking the kernel every time you submit some work to the threads
would probably not fly.

If there's a good use case fine for me. However I suspect it's
either "slow is ok" or "want it very fast" where even a syscall
would hurt.
