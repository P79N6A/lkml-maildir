generally it's easier to just go "back in time" and re-try the last 
known "good" and last-known "bad" commit IDs to establish that they are 
indeed correctly identified. if they are not then step back one more in 
the bisection log. No need to spend another 4 days on this, if most of 
the bisection is OK. You can replay a corrected git bisection log 
quickly, by doing:
  git-bisect reset
  git-bisect < bisect.log
