Who does this?  I'm assuming that a is the "top" layer.  Aren't union
mounts typically about sharing lower layers and having a separate rw
layer for each union mount?

That's exactly what I would expect.
If I were to:
$ echo "this is new" > /u1/foo
I would expect:
$ cat /u2/foo
this is new
So why should rm behave differently?
I haven't really been tuned into union mounts, so maybe I'm missing out
on something basic here.
Thanks,
