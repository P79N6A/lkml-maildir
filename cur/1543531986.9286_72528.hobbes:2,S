You'll need additional thread as it's now. Just for emergency cases.

Control thread will do it.

Of course. That's why you'll need control thread as well: in case of SEGFAULT
this thread will kill other threads. Since it's not normal system behaviour
(normal program should not end up with SEGFAULT now and then) this code can
safely live in userspace. Creation of new thread can be done without context
switches, though... Or I'm missing something ?
