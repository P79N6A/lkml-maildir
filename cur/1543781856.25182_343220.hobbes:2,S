One other point: Another problems is that we quiesce all shost IO before
waking up the eh. 
I was changing it to wakeup the eh even while other IO is outstanding, so
the eh can wakeup and cancel individual commands while other IO is still
using the HBA.

So, for EH_NOT_HANDLED, do you add the scmd to a LLDD list in your
eh_timed_out, then wait for the eh to run?
Or maybe your host can_queue is 1 :)

I don't see it ... hence my question above.
