I guess I am just lucky, because that hasn't failed me in years. I think
I can live with that for now.

Looking at the (lack of) answers to my question, I gather there is no
clear-cut answer, or rather that the answer is "you don't".

Is everyone aware of these issues?
And, just wondering -- if loop-AES works so much better, why hasn't it
been included in the kernel?
