At some point we should stop tossing out patches and replacing them in this
manner.
Because doing so makes it hard for people to see what has changed.  
It makes it hard for people to see that changes in the above patches
haven't been simply lost.
And the fact that you were probably working against some kernel other than
-mm gives little confidence that the kdump development team have been
testing the patches which are presently in -mm.  And that is what they are
there for.
