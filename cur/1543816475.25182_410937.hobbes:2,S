Well, when is this code called?  It would be at boot time, in which case
the allocations will succeed (if not, the boot fails) or at cpu/node
hot-add, in which case the appropriate response is to fail to bring up the
new cpu/node.
It's better to send the administrator back to work out why we ran out of
memory than to appear to have brought the new cpu/node online, only to have
it run funny.
I think?

umm, it's probably best to not bother.  I think Ashok is looking into all
the memory we're presently wasting on non-cpu_hotplug builds.  There's
quite a lot in there.
