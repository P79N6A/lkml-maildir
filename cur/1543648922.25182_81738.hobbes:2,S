This change is problematic, the FIB etc. lookup engine internal
structure must be entirely private to the implementation.
That allows it to be changed arbitrarily and the rest of the
kernel will not notice.
You should probably move the seq_file handling here directly back into
the routing code.
Really, we should not be exporting all of these lookup tables merely
for the sake of ip_proc.c, in fact move all this seq_file stuff back
into the arp/udp/fib/etc. places they came from.  Exporting these
tables just for this makes no sense the more I think about it.
