Pot. Kettle. Black.  You are one who tries to tell other people what
can be done with their code.  With all my personal dislike of GPL
(I use it if the project I'm working on does, but I won't use it
for anything else), Dave _has_ right to choose the license he likes
and you'd bloody better respect that.  Author has absolute right
to set the conditions for using his thing.  If they are unacceptable
for you - nobody forces you to use it.  Any whining about that places
you on the level of Napster wankers.  Now, bugger off - go play with
"social hackers" or something...
