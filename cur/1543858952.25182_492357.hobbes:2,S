When dv1394 is loaded, the use count of ohci1394 is incremented because
dv1394 uses symbols of ohci1394. Likewise, when dv1394 is removed,
ohci1394's use count is decremented which may render ohci1394 "unused".
It will then be removed too. This is of course not desired in many cases.

raw1394 does not mark FireWire hosts as in use. I think we should add
try_module_get(host->driver->owner) and module_put(host->driver->owner)
either to initiation and release of requests, or to the raw1394_open()
and raw1394_release() hooks for all hosts which are present when the
file is opened, or simply to raw1394's add_host() and remove_host() hooks.
I'll make a note on bugzilla.kernel.org and try to find a proper fix
some time.

That's what was necessary after you removed dv1394.

This is, how should I put it, not good. Maybe raw1394 still held
resources on behalf of kino which related to the host that first
vanished, then reappeared as a new one. Anyway; raw1394 is supposed to
handle life addition and removal of hosts, but we obviously missed
something.

What if you prevent dv1394 from ever being loaded, or don't build it in
the first place? CONFIG_IEEE1394_DV1394=n
