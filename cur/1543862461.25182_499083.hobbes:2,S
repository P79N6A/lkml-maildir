What I was thinking about was something like the following.
* ops
	unsigned int (*determine_xfer_mask)(struct ata_device *dev);
	int (*set_specific_mode)(struct ata_device *dev,
				unsigned int xfer_mode);
* during init and EH
	if (init) {
		ap->xfer_mask &= ops->determine_xfer_mask(dev);
		DETERMINE best_mode;
	}
	if (ap->ehi.target_mode && valid)
		mode = ap->ehi.target_mode;
	else
		mode = best_mode;
	rc = ops->set_specific_mode(dev, mode);
* when the user issues SET_XFERMODE, in the issue path
	if (command is SET_XFERMODE) {
		if (mode is invalid)
			fail;
		ap->ehi.target_mode = user_specified_mode;
		ata_port_schedule_eh(ap);
		done;
	}
To sum up,
1. separate supported mode detection and mode programming such that we
can use the same programming path for both init and handling user-issued
SET_XFERMODE.
2. group all mode programming callbacks (->set_piomode, ->set_dmamode
and ->post_set_mode into ->set_specific_mode) into ->set_specific_mode
to allow more flexibility and replace ->set_mode.
3. make sure all xfer mode programming is done in EH.  this will ease
support for weird controllers (e.g. cross-port synchronization).
Thanks.
