The sb driver is fine

some of the sound stuff uses very short fragments to get accurate 
audio/video synchronization. Some apps also do it gratuitously when they
should be using other API's. Its also used sensibly for things like
gnome-meeting where its worth trading CPU for latency because 1K of
buffering starts giving you earth<->moon type conversations

Not really - the app asked for an event every 32 bytes. This is an app not
kernel problem.

With a few exceptions the applications tend to use 4K or larger DMA chunks
anyway. Very few need tiny chunks.
