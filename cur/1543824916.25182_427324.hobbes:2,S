I don't see anything particularly bad in that dmesg output,
apart from all of the debug output --> did you enable that,
or was it "on" by default?
It finds one SATA drive, with no *known* partition table format.
Can you access the disk?  Eg.  hexdump -C /dev/sda
Meanwhile, I just booted 2.6.17-rc5-git1 (latest kernel.org) on my Mac G3
box here, and sata_mv seems to be behaving for me (thus far).
Cheers
