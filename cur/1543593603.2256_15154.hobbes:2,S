I believe that Netfilter will do this for you.  Look at:
Owner match support (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_OWNER
  Packet owner matching allows you to match locally-generated packets
  based on who created them: the user, group, process or session.
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.
