    Capacity:
    Capacity is the amount of data that the drive can store, after
    formatting. Most disc drive companies, including Seagate, calculate disc
    capacity based on the assumption that 1 megabyte = 1000 kilobytes and 1
    gigabyte=1000 megabytes.
Disks have a natural measurement of capacity based on an integral number
of 512byte blocks. So kilobytes (1024) makes sense for them. 
The only marketing wizardry is to use the smaller of:
	1 megabyte = 1000 kilobytes
instead of:
	1 megabyte = 1024 kilobytes
There are valid arguements for both interpretations.
