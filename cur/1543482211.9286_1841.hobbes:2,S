I posted a newbie possible kernel or kernel config error
where I was getting:
Sound: DMA (output) timed out - IRQ/DRQ config error?
...with the same config as 2.0.36 (which sound is PERFECT).
I haven't narrowed down the problem other than _not_ selecting
plug-n-play and/or trying to fire up sndconfig in RH 5.2 to get
my ducks in order _before_ I post!  Yes, I have a ESS1688
also...
