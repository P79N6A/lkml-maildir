Hi.
Can anyone tll me what address the following will branch to?
I've looked at 6ba4, 6ba4>>1, 6ba4<<1, 6ba4<<2 and PC+6ba4, but none of
them seem to make sense. (yes, I know there will be thumb code there).
   a08bc:       e59fc000        ldr     ip, [pc, #0]    ; a08c4
<_binary_bin_16_size+0x1e0>
   a08c0:       e12fff1c        bx      ip
   a08c4:       00006ba5        andeq   r6, r0, r5, lsr #23
Thanks for any help :)
