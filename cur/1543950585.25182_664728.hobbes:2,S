The problem is that libata EH and other stuff aren't ready to let go of
the SCSI host up until the last moment and that last moment can't be
moved before SCSI host destruction because shutdown sequence (flush and
spindown) requires live EH.  I think this can be solved by shooting down
individual sdev's instead of destroying the scsi_host.
Thanks.
