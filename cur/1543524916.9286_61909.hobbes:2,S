The kernel supports up to 3GB of address space per process.
The first 900MB can be allocated by brk() and the rest can
be allocated by mmap().
Problem is that libc malloc() appears to use brk() only, so
it is limited to 900MB. You can fix that by doing the brk()
and malloc() yourself, but I think that in the long run the
glibc people may want to change their malloc implementation
so that it automatically supports the full 3GB...

Rik
