The specification is complete for everything that it covers. Right now,
there are some things that can't be handled by UDI that will be added in
future versions of the specification.
Your question is about like asking "Why do we need a UNIX98 specification
when we have POSIX?"
In my opinion, the group came out with a very workable specification. It
doesn't cover everything right now, but it does cover the dominate devices
such as disk and network interface cards. They had to get it out there so
more people could start implementing with it.

The UDI implementation does the locking, not the device driver. The device
driver just uses the regions. If for some brain-damaged reason a UDI
implementation decides to only have a single lock for every device, that
isn't because of anything in the UDI specification. It would just be a bad
implementation of UDI.
The current bugs with SMP drivers changing the current state would be fixed
in the UDI implementation software, not each UDI driver using it. Fix it in
one source file, not each driver that comes out.
