I think I missed this on linux-scsi.  However, there have been some fairly 
major scsi fixes which necessitated changes to your driver (among others) so 
it could be that the patches now reject.  Could you rebase to 2.5.44 and 
resend to linux-scsi (or just post a URL, if that's easier)?
Thanks,
James
