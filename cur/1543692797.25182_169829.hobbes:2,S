Just a helpful hint for the future: Do no jump to conclusions so easily. 
  You originally stated there's a bug in linux.  This probably rubbed 
people the wrong way, people here work hard on linux, some are grumpy, 
and for someone to come in here and tell them "here's a big fat bug in 
linux" when in fact it isn't a bug, well, many good people could become 
not so friendly.  If you would have said "Clarification needed, is this 
a bug?" or something, I think you would have gotten less hostile replies.
Then again, maybe you're on to something, I've been very nice, 
unassuming and cordial about my filesystem cache question, maybe I need 
to post a message with the subject "Bug in vm/filesystem cache" so I can 
get a response. :(
Sincerely,
Brett
