is what I think was intended.  Also, I'm not sure <pid> is the best
meta-syntax - anybody got a better idea?

What happens if you try to remove a container that still has active tasks? Are
you relying on the VFS to catch the 'non-empty directory'? (of course, 'rm -r'
has predictable semantics here).
I see support for "add a task" and "remove a task", but none for listing
the current tasks in the container?
