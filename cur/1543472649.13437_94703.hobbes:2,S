"Specially designed hardware" != "not shelf hardware" :-) BTW hardware part is
more flexible here then software part ...

Of course. There are database as core of the system. *nix is not designed this
way. Both designs has benefits but analogy: both swiss roll and stockfish
are nice food while swiss roll with stockfish is ...

Exactly. And raw devices support makes kernel unnecessary complex and (even more
important!) much more flexible. "And complexity kills software" :-)) And since
this is not needed by 99% (more like 99.99% :-) of users mainstream kernel will
not include raw devices support :-))

Create module for raw access. Create special filesystem (better way IMO). Do not
pollute mainstream kernel with stuff needed by only 1% (more like 0.01%) of
users just as "temporary solution". Linux is not Solaris or HP-UX: it could be
tweacked as needed and when needed.
