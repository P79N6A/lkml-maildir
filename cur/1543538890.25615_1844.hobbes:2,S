But Jeff, this kills our best chance of ever locating the bug! We need
to get one decent ksymoops trace to nail this.
As a compromise you could add
#ifdef CONFIG_X86
	show_stack(0);
#endif
However that's a weak compromise because ksymoops doesn't understand
show_stack() output.
Why not leave it in and fix the root cause?
