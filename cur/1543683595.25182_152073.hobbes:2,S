           Summary: cu -l /dev/ttyS0 got a signal hangup in 2.5 kernel
    Kernel Version: 2.5.75
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: rmk@arm.linux.org.uk

Hardware Environment:NetVista 6579-A4U Pentium III - 866 MHz 256MB RAM 
Software Environment:2.5.75 kernel 
Problem Description: cu session fails to log into the other machine which is connected with a 
null modem serial cable between serial ports. 
It works fine in 2.4.19 4GB kernel 
Steps to reproduce: 
  1. connecting two systems with a null modem serial cable between serial ports. 
  2. On one machine, do : cu -l /dev/ttyS0 
      On other system, have /sbin/agetty -L 9600 ttyS0 vt100  running. 
      and ttyS0 has been defined in /etc/securetty 
  3. cu session connected and showed you the login prompt. 
  4. Got a hangup signal and disconnected after typing "root" or any user ID. 
      It supposes to prompt you "password:" to let you type the password of the other machine 
      to login to that system.
