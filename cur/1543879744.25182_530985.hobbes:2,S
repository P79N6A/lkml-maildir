On x86_64 hardware using ata_piix I was unable to boot kernels
based on the current 2.6.20.x either.  Regardless of extra kernel
parameters used I was getting consistently 'hdc: lost interrupt',
and/or similar and after something like that the whole machine
was dead.  The only differences were if I could still reboot
from a keyboard or if I really have to pull a plug.
A kernel derived from 2.6.21-rc6-git1 (2.6.20-1.3053.fc7.x86_64 from
Fedora "rawhide" to be more precise) did boot on the hardware in
question, though; but only when I gave it 'acpi=off'.  Without that
parameter it was getting stuck apparently when starting hotplug.
In that kernel case disks were accessed using pata_atiixp driver.
