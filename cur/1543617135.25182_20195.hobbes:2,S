We know that :)  Here, "RT" means "Linux-RT": something which is non-SCHED_OTHER,
and which we'd prefer didn't completely suck.

Well, that's my point.  A well-designed DVD player would have two processes.
One which tangles with the sockets, pipes, disks, etc, and which feeds data into
and out of the SCHED_FIFO task via a shared, mlocked memory region.
What I'm trying to develop here is a set of guidelines which will allow
application developers to design these programs with a reasonable
degree of success.
