Subject: Bug in "select" dependency checking?

Hello,
I think the dependency check in scripts/kconfig/symbol.c has a bug
related to "select", but possibly it's only a misunderstanding what
select is supposed to do. I have the following symbols and dependencies
(simplified):
  config NFS_ACL_SUPPORT
	tristate
  config NFSD
	tristate "..."
	select NFS_ACL_SUPPORT if NFSD_ACL	
  config NFSD_V3
	bool "..."
	depends on NFSD
  config NFSD_ACL
	bool "..."
	depends on NFSD_V3
  config NFS_FS
	tristate "..."
	select NFS_ACL_SUPPORT if NFS_ACL
  config NFS_V3
	bool "..."
	depends on NFS_FS
  config NFS_ACL
	bool "..."
	depends on NFS_V3
The intention of this is as follows: NFS_ACL_SUPPORT is a symbol without
menu entry. It activates an object which is either a module or linked
into the kernel. It is needed if NFSD_ACL is y or NFS_ACL is y. When it
is needed, it should have max(NFSD,NFS_FS).
With this configuration, menuconf gives me this message (among others):
  Warning! Found recursive dependency: NFSD_V3 NFSD_ACL NFSD NFSD_V3
In my understanding, the select statement does not cause a dependency of
NFSD on NFSD_ACL. I can write the same thing without selects as follows:
  config NFS_ACL_SUPPORT
        tristate
        default y if (NFSD=y || NFS_FS=y) && (NFSD_ACL || NFS_ACL)
        default m if (NFSD!=y && NFS_FS!=y) && (NFSD=m || NFS_FS=m) &&
		     (NFSD_ACL || NFS_ACL)
Any thoughts?
Cheers,
