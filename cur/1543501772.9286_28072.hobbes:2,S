Hi,
  Yes, I still want to control my IDE rack :) (is this the actual name in
English? Dunno... A "case" containing an IDE HD)
  I've been browsing through the 2.2.10 code a little (drivers/block/ide.c) in
order to find what ioctls I could use. What I want to do is: invalidate one
peirpheral (namely, hdc), revalidate it and possibly identify it in a unique
way, and here's the relevant ioctls I could find (and BTW WTH aren't they
documented somewhere? :( ide.txt tells nothing):
HDIO_GETGEO (argument: struct hd_geometry *): returns the drive geometry;
HDIO_GETIDENTITY (argument: char[142]): returns the drive name;
BLKRRPART (argument: none): rereads the partition table
HDIO_SCAN_HWIF (argument: int[3]={data_port, ctl_port, irq} - which one is data,
which one is ctl? Not mentioned in comments at the top of the file): scans the
IDE interface at data_port (interface_wise, unfortunately :( )
HDIO_UNREGISTER_HWIF (argument: unsigned int n): invalidates IDE interface # n
(interface-wise too :( )
That's all I could find for now. Are there any others I could find of interest
to me, knowing what I want to do? In perticular are there ioctls allowing
invalidation/revalidation peripheral-wise and not interface-wise?
