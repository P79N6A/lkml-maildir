Your code looks generally good.  I have some comments.
You can't do this, even though you want to:
-EXPORT_SYMBOL(paravirt_ops);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(paravirt_ops);
The problem is it makes all modules GPL - or at least all modules that 
use any kind of locking, pull in the basic definitions to enable and 
disable interrupts, thus the paravirt_ops symbol, so basically all modules.
What you really want is more like EXPORT_SYMBOL_READABLE_GPL(paravirt_ops);
But I'm not sure that is technically feasible yet.
The kvm code should probably go in kvm.c instead of paravirt.c.

Is this a bug that might happen under other virtualizations as well, not 
just kvm? Perhaps it deserves a disable feature instead of a kvm 
specific check.
Which also gets rid of the need for this unusually placed extern:
