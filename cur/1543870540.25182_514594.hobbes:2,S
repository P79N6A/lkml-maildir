What sort of numbers do you have for these controllers that aren't
very good at doing sg?
Isn't the issue was something like your IO controllers have only a
limited number of sg entries, which is fine with 16K pages, but with
4K pages that doesn't give enough data to cover your RAID stripe?
We're never going to do a variable sized pagecache just because of that.
