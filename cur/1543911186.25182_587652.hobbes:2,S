Hello, Gautham,
We could do something similar.  If there was a global rcu_boost_data
variable that held the sums of the fields of the rcu_boost_data
structures for all offline CPUs, and if we used a new lock to protect
that global rcu_boost data variable (both when reading and when
CPU hotplugging), then we could indeed scan only the online CPUs'
rcu_boost_data elements.
We would also have to maintain a cpumask_t for this purpose, and
we would need to add a CPU's contribution when it went offline and
subtract it when that CPU came back online.
The lock should not be a problem even on very large systems because
of the low frequency of statistics printing -- and of hotplug operations,
for that matter.
						Thanx, Paul
