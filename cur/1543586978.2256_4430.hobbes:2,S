Hi,
OOPS! I sent a wrong mail earlier under the same subject.
Linux kernel source level debugger, kgdb for linux kernel 2.4.3
is available from 
http://kgdb.sourceforge.net/
This version has following improvements over kgdb for 2.4.2 kernels:
1. Changed #ifdef __SMP__ statements to #ifdef CONFIG_SMP. 
2. Removed EXTRAVERSION=-kgdb line from the Makefile. This had
caused change in the name of the kernel. It was inconvenient in some
setups. If name of the kernel was already changed, the patch would fail
at this line.
Regards.
