	In 2.2.17pre20 I started running into *really* annoying issues w/ an
eepro100, I'm going to go back to 2.2.16 and see if they clear up.  Basically
things were constantly seeming to stall for me.  Not everything though, it
seemed like larger things would whereas smaller things wouldn't, but only
sometimes. :)
	Examples:
	dmesg consistantly would stall
	ps awux had no real issues (small process list)
	top worked okay
	switching between windows under screen quickly would stall it
	grabbing kernel source wasn't a problem
	scp'ing a couple >1M files wasn't an issue
		Very odd.  Never had any problems w/ eepro100's under 2.2.16
	or earlier.
