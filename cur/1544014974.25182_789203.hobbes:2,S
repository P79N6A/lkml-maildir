I have ever considered this method too. This one is simpler, but the
drawbacks are as follow:
- cryptd thread is not per-CPU, so I think there will be some
unnecessary cache inter-CPU migration. Why not use a dedicate workqueue
or just system events workqueue?
- with cryptd(__*-aes-aesni), we need 4 internal tfms for each external
tfm allocation request. For example, for one external cbc(aes) tfm
allocation request, we need one cbc(aes) ablkcipher tfm, one
cryptd(cbc-aes-aesni) tfm, and two cbc-aes-aesni tfm. Do we use too much
memory? And we need to call aesni_set_key() twice.

Yes. This is really a simple method.
