Okay, looking at tcp_sendmsg a little more, it looks like it lets go of the
sock lock in wait_for_tcp_memory before re-acquiring it, which is probably
where the interleaving gets in. I'm not sure if TCP should be handling this
or NFSD. From what little I know, TCP should serialize requests it gets and
atomically write them out, preventing interleaving, and it looks like it
doesn't do that.
