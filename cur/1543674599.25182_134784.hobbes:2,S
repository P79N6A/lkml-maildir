    oops.  That's due to me "don't call vmtruncate if i_size didn't change"
    speedup.  It was a pretty good speedup too.
    Does this look sane?
Well, before this 2.5.66 patch vmtruncate() was called, which called
foofs->truncate(), which probably did
	inode->i_mtime = inode->i_ctime = CURRENT_TIME;
and it looks like you do the same now. So, yes.
[Why is this in foofs->truncate() and not in vfs code?]
[It looks like the only way ATTR_SIZE can be set is from the
do_truncate, so maybe your patch is equivalent to changing open.c:
88c88
<       newattrs.ia_valid = ATTR_SIZE | ATTR_CTIME;
---
>       newattrs.ia_valid = ATTR_SIZE | ATTR_CTIME | ATTR_MTIME;
("It looks like" means: nfs does unspeakable things,
intermezzo has izo_do_truncate(), a copy of do_truncate(),
hpfs_unlink() tries a truncate if there is no space for a delete,
ncp_notify_change() may have ATTR_SIZE without ATTR_MTIME.)]
On the other hand, my question was really a different one:
do we want to follow POSIX, also in the silly requirement
that truncate only sets mtime when the size changes, while
O_TRUNC and ftruncate always set mtime.
If so, we have to uglify do_truncate().
