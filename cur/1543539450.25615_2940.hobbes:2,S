Let me try to understand what you're saying...
It is established that a system's interface allows programs to
physically destroy a disk drive, without providing any benefit
whatsoever.  However, since it's possible to fry other hardware,
too, why bother with this problem???
The fact of the matter is, that it is wrong for a program to
destroy hardware.  It is the kernel's job to ensure that it
can't.  It is pure laziness to ignore the issue.
My feeling is that we should try to avoid all possible ways of
accidentally or maliciously breaking parts.  We can start out
by fixing the IDE subsystem, and then go on to others.  Just
because other stuff is broken, too, doesn't mean that we should
give up.
