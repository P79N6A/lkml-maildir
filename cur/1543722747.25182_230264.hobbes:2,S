But... there's no reasonable way to do this in userspace.
Two pieces of kernel support are needed:
1) some way to indicate "this file is elastic" (okay perhaps xattrs
can do this already)
and either
2a) file selection/deletion in kernel
or
2b) assume that disk does not fill up faster than 1GB/sec, allways
keep 1GB free, make "deleting" daemon poll each second [ugly,
unreliable]
or
2c) just before returning -ENOSPC, synchronously tell userspace to
free space, and retry the operation.
BTW 2c) would be also usefull for undelete. Unfortunately 2c looks
very complex, too; it might be easier to do 2a than 2c.
