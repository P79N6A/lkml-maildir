I actually much prefer the "read_can_lock()" suggestion by Peter.
Also, why this:
	+#define rwlock_read_locked(x) (atomic_read((atomic_t *)&(x)->lock) <= 0)
what the _heck_ is that "atomic_read((atomic_t *)&(x)->lock)", and why is 
it not just a "(int)(x)->lock" instead?
So I think it would be much better as
	#define read_can_lock(x) ((int)(x)->lock > 0)
which seems simple and straightforward.
And it probably should be in <asm-i386/rwlock.h>, since that is where the 
actual implementation is, and <asm-i386/spinlock.h> doesn't really have 
any clue what the rules are, and shouldn't act like it has.
