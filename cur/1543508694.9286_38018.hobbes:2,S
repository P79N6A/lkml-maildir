Had this problem for a long time on a Toshiba 7020CT in 2.2.x. I solve the
problem by booting straight into X. Also, doesn't seem to be a problem
when booting to single user mode. Haven't noticed the problem in 2.3.x,
but 2.3.17 doesn't compile for me; problems with toshoboe driver and
usb. I think I'll wait for 2.3.18...
