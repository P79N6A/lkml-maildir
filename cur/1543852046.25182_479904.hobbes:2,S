Yes, this is an issue which I documented in my patch. It's not a hang,
but a long delay if you have many cpus. Other drivers with firmware
request have the same issue if they are built-in. Maybe we should fix
the firmware request mechanism itself. I hope no distribution has
microcode driver built-in.
