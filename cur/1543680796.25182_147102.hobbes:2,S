Hi all,
at the link below you can find rmap15j + all BK fixes/adds for 2.4.22-pre4. 
I've done this because rmap is my favorite VM and I want to support it where 
I can, and this is just a "Tons of users want to use bleeding edge -pre's so 
give them a very good VM" ;)
Have fun.
P.S.: The only part I was unsure about is the s390x init.c stuff.
      I've also included .22-BK mainline cset 1.1086 which is a showstopper.
      I've not attached the patch to this mail because it's kinda large.
Compiles, boots, works [tm] on my x86 machine :)
