I think there is a qualitative difference.
2.6.x is the end of a line that 2.6.x-rc* leads up to.  There is a
clear end.  "I will test when it gets to the end".
2.6.x.y doesn't.  If the releases are quick (daily if there is
anything to release) then there is no clear end to the list, just a
beginning.  There may never be a 2.6.x.1 for some values of x, so
people won't be able to wait for the .1 or the .2 release.  They will
have to just take what is available when they want to upgrade.
If we want to stop people from waiting for a final release before they
test, we need to make sure there isn't a (recognisable in advance)
final release.
