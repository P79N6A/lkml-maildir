Besides what was already mentioned in this thread, let me add some 
points:
- most Linux applications already support ALSA
- kernel 2.6.0 with ALSA as default sound system was released in 2003
- the ALSA developers provide an in-kernel OSS emulation
- the ALSA developers provide an alternative user space OSS emulation
- there are many new soundcards without any OSS driver at all [1]
Compatibility is important, and it's nearly always working
(e.g. "aoss audacity" works for me perfectly).
There are only few exotic cornercases like ALSA #1735 where a subset of 
the OSS functionality is not working in the OSS emulation - and I doubt 
it would be worth putting much effort into fixing such cornercases.
