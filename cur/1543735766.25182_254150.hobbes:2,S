Well, I verified that it works before this merge
torvalds@ppc970.osdl.org|ChangeSet|20040916140404|15905
and doesn't with it (this was Linus pulling in your input tree).

Yes, disabling EHCI in the config allows boot.
This is what lspci says about the USB controller:
0000:a0:01.0 USB Controller: NEC Corporation USB (rev 41) (prog-if 10
[OHCI])
        Subsystem: NEC Corporation USB
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 128, IRQ 57
        Memory at 00000000d0022000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=4K]
        Capabilities: [40] Power Management version 2
0000:a0:01.1 USB Controller: NEC Corporation USB (rev 41) (prog-if 10
[OHCI])
        Subsystem: NEC Corporation USB
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 128, IRQ 58
        Memory at 00000000d0021000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=4K]
        Capabilities: [40] Power Management version 2
0000:a0:01.2 USB Controller: NEC Corporation USB 2.0 (rev 02) (prog-if
20 [EHCI])
        Subsystem: NEC Corporation USB 2.0
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 128, IRQ 59
        Memory at 00000000d0020000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=256]
        Capabilities: [40] Power Management version 2
So it looks like ACPI is routing the IRQ's corectly.  Just to confirm,
here's the ACPI routing probe from boot:
ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:a0:01.0[A] -> GSI 38 (level, low) -> IRQ 57
GSI 39 (level, low) -> CPU 0 (0x0000) vector 58
ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:a0:01.1[B] -> GSI 39 (level, low) -> IRQ 58
GSI 40 (level, low) -> CPU 0 (0x0000) vector 59
ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:a0:01.2[C] -> GSI 40 (level, low) -> IRQ 59
Anything else you need?
