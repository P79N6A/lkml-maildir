That was something that irritated me too while writing the patch, but the functions I 
am interested in with this  are referenced from arch/x86/power/cpu.c and that is
obj-$(CONFIG_PM)                += cpu.o
So you would need to fix that first. Would be fine for me, but is out of scope for
my patch.
