Right. Follow the same argument for renames, as well. ("Well, what did
it *used* be to named?") Short of caching the entire contents, there's
no way to know if all that's returned is an inode.

In the case of a directory that's being monitored going away, userspace
has already asked for tracking events for that directory explicitly, and
has to keep track of the cookie ("watch descriptor") to directory name
mapping (or some context, at least) already. That's the only way it
knows the correct context for the events.
For example, I ask for monitoring of two different directories on my
system, both with a final path component of "etc". Since the kernel
can't pass back the full path (cf. mount --bind, or consider an
watch/chdir/watch sequence, if you believe the kernel should cache the
full path passed to it from userspace), it instead needs to pass back
something unique for that directory. The name isn't, and the full
pathname isn't available to the kernel. So, the watch descriptor, being
an arbitrary but unique cookie, steps in.

<Nod> That's actually a stronger argument with me than the micro-
optimization. Orthogonal interfaces allow for more uses. However, I can
find no way to clean up the interface any more than what's been
suggested so far.

Fair enough.

Agreed.

It would bring inotify almost down to the level of usefulness of
dnotify, which would be painful.
