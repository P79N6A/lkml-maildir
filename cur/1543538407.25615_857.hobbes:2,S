Jeff, Anton
I am currently running 2.2.17. Are these fixmes the same for the 2.4 test
kernel. By the way, I have been doing some test with the current
2.2.17 ntfs implementation. "It sort of needs work" I hope you don't
mind when me saying that. Somehow it manages to over heat my hard disk, 
no permanent damage.
I will grab ntfs docs I can find and start working on this. Do you
mind given me pointers to the ntfs docs you know of.
Thanks.
