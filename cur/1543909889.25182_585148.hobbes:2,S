Note that I said these are the cases _where one might want to allow
caching_, so of course adding volatile doesn't help _these_ cases.
There are of course other cases where one definitely doesn't want to
allow the compiler to cache the value, such as when polling an atomic
variable waiting for another CPU to change it, and from my inspection
so far these cases seem to be the majority.
The reasons for having "volatile" behaviour of atomic_read (whether or
not that is achieved by use of the "volatile" C keyword) are
- It matches the normal expectation based on the name "atomic_read"
- It matches the behaviour of the other atomic_* primitives
- It avoids bugs in the cases where "volatile" behaviour is required
To my mind these outweigh the small benefit for some code of the
non-volatile (caching-allowed) behaviour.  In fact it's pretty minor
either way, and since x86[-64] has this behaviour, one can expect the
potential bugs in generic code to have mostly been found, although
perhaps not all of them since x86[-64] has less aggressive reordering
of memory accesses and fewer registers in which to cache things than
some other architectures.
