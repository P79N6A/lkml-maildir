Unfortunately a lot of existing applications require it.  "cp" and "tar", 
for example: if you use a "cp -a" or a tar over hard links, it is the 
unique (filesystem, inode number) identifier for the file which allows
hard links to be identified.
If you abandon the existence of such an identifier, then how can tar 
maintain the current behaviour?
