LVM or device mapper seems to be broken in -mm. I've only tried the 
following kernels so far: 
2.5.64 - works 
2.5.65-mm2 - doesn't work 
2.5.66 - works 
2.5.66-mm1 - doesn't work
Just another data point. LVM in -mm stopped working for me at
2.5.65-mm2, it did work in 2.5.65-mm1. 2.5.65-mm[234] did not work
either.
Regards,
Shane
