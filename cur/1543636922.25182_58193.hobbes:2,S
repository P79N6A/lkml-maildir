Thanks, Bill.  Yup, I'm playing with pte_chain_mempool at present.

OK.  But we're adding non-trivial amounts of new code simply
to get the reverse mapping working as robustly as the virtual
scan.  And we'll always have rmap's additional storage requirements.
At some point we need to make a decision as to whether it's all
worth it.  Right now we do not even have the information on the
pluses side to do this.  That's worrisome.
