My collection is primarily of original kernel tarballs and patches
(all the patches are originals, but some of the tarballs are ones I've
recreated from a previous tarball plus one or more original patches).
I see my site as being a base reference for people producing
CVS/RCS/whatever based master trees, and can see the place for
both. In fact, I'm willing to provide copies of the CD sets to anybody
interested, and that includes those developing rival products. All of
the stuff on the CD's is GPL'd or under equivalent licences, and I've
no interest in fighting that - I don't believe in it anyway.
Best wishes from Riley.
