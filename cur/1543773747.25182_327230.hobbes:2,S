It depends on what you mean by allocate and deallocate.  If the second
process is attaching the same shared memory segment as the first process
had attached, then yes, its buffer will contain those very pages which
the driver erroneously failed to release.

No.  That was a bug peculiar to anonymous memory,
whereas shared memory is treated like file cache.
