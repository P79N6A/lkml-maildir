Engineering assumption.  Your hardware and/or software always contains
at least one bug.  Therefore even in hard real time you must design
and code for the failure case.  Hard real time is just doing
everything humanly possible to meet it's deadlines. 
The difference with soft real time, is that something that is humanly
possible to do was left off.
Despite the strong relationship to mathematics there are no absolutes
in computer science.  Especially hard real time.
