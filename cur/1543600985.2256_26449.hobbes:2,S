I found out I can boot it after little games with mars netware
emulator. However I have problems booting anything else than
freedos. Trying to boot zImage directly results in crc errors or in
errors in compressed data. Too much failures and too repeatable
(althrough ram seems flakey) for me to believe its hw.
