Ok, reproduced error at ./net/ipv4/fib_semantics.c
  line 436 changed label:
                   errout -> err_inval
then it builds fine!
started with linux-2.4.34
then patched
     patch-2.4.34.1
     patch-2.4.34.2
     patch-2.4.34.3
     patch-2.4.34.4
     patch-2.4.34.5
     patch-2.4.35.pre5
I used a make oldconfig on a .config that builds in 2.4.34
Hope that helps
