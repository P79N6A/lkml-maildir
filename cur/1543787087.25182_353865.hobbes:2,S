Luben,
The fact that your responses are constantly filled with non-technical 
paranoia does not help the inclusion of aic94xx at all.
Maybe you need to write your driver as a block driver, and completely 
skip the SCSI core, if it bothers you so much?  That would get everybody 
else out of the loop, and free you to write the driver as you see fit.
As it stands now, you're making an end run around the SCSI core, rather 
than fixing it up.  SCSI needs to be modified for SAS, not just 
complained about.
