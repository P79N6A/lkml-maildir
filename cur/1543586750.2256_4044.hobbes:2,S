OK for now.

The 2.2.XX-preY pre kernels are basically pre-releases, which means getting 
fairly close (except for a few bugs) to the 2.2.XX kernel. Of course, the 
highest the Y the closest to the release, and this applies to other 
branches, such as 2.4.
The 2.2.XX-acY are the "Alan Cox releases". All the patches submitted to 
this list are merged by Alan, then released as patches (you can get them 
from ftp.KK.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/alan/2.2 or 2.4, where KK if 
your country code {uk|de|fr|whatever}). They can be considered as some sort 
of intermediate steps between two releases, although some of the patches 
may not be included in the next release, for different reasons. The current 
one for the 2.4 branch is the 2.4.3-ac2.
