Changelog extract
	* Fix regex for ia64 'Bank nn' message.
	* Strip leading '+' from lines.
Some people have reported problems building ksymoops, with unresolved
references in libbfd (htab_create, htab_find_slot_with_hash).  Try
http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/linux/linux-kernel/2002-13/0196.html
 first,
if that does not work, contact the binutils maintainers.  This is not a
ksymoops problem, ksymoops only uses libbfd.  Any unresolved references
from libbfd are a binutils problem.
