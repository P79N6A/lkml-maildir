Greg, I still don't see this upstream; I think it should be merged
expeditiously, since it makes some boxes panic on boot.  (One can
generally recover by using dev=<major:minor> instead of dev=/dev/foo/bar
but I still think having tester's boxes panic on boot because of a known
fixed bug is not ideal)
