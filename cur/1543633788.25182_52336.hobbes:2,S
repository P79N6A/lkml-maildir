Nick,

Read about the JUNK hardware base you are working with.
This is one of the reasons people avoid VIA.
OIC, it worked perfectly in wonder kernel but not in the latest.
Did you check to see if there were other changes in the kernel which could
effect the behavior and operations?
A real simple test is to undo the changes to the Promise code and does
the problem still exist?  If it does then it is not the driver it self.
However the other changes in conjuntion could cause problems, that is a
fair point to be made.
So how about including which kernel was the last working version.
For kicks I would back port the driver to prove it is not the driver, or
allow you to prove it is.
Cheers,
