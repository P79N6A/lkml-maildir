OK, I guess it's just thrashing.  Having 64MB of RAM with
250 Apache processes will give you about 256kB per Apache
process ... minus page table, TCP, etc... overhead.
That sounds like the machine just gets a working set
larger than the amount of available memory. It should
work better with eg. 96, 128 or more MBs of memory.
