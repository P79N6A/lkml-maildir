Hi, Andrew -
These patches bring the ipath driver up to date with a number of bug fixes,
performance improvements, and better PowerPC support.  There are a few
whitespace and formatting patches in the series, but they're all self-
contained.  The patches have been tested internally, and shouldn't contain
anything controversial.
My hope is that they'll sit in -mm for a little bit, and make it into
an early 2.6.18 -rc kernel.
Thanks,
	<b
