I didn't fiddle with it too much, but I added a printk to sg_detect and
verified it was not getting called at all.  I notice now, however, that I
don't even have a /proc/scsi/sg.  Does that mean it's not getting
initialized at all?  CONFIG_CHR_DEV_SG=y, assuming that's what needs to
be set (config didn't change between kernel versions).
At one point before I followed some of the debug/logging commands listed
at the top of sg.c and got an Oops as well...
