OK, thanks.  I assume the machine's working OK?
From my reading, you have CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU enabled and the machine has an
APIC.  I'd expect that lots of people would hit that warning but for some
reason they don't - possibly because most APICs don't have sufficiently
high version numbers?
Anyway, various people cc'ed.  I _think_ it's harmless, although the way in
which def_to_bigsmp propagates into the DMI and APIC code might be a
problem, depending upon config options.
Certainly the warning is incorrect, but I'm not sure what is the best thing
to do about it?
