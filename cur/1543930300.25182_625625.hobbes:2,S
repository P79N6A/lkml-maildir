Subject: [PATCH 2.6.24-rc4] proc: Remove/Fix proc generic d_revalidate
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Ultimately to implement /proc perfectly we need an implementation
of d_revalidate because files and directories can be removed behind
the back of the VFS, and d_revalidate is the only way we can let
the VFS know that this has happened.
Unfortunately the linux VFS can not cope with anything in the path
to a mount point going away.  So a proper d_revalidate method that
calls d_drop also needs to call have_submounts which is moderately
expensive, so you really don't want a d_revalidate method that
unconditionally calls it, but instead only calls it when the
backing object has really gone away.
proc generic entries only disappear on module_unload (when
not counting the fledgling network namespace) so it is quite rare
that we actually encounter that case and has not actually caused
us real world trouble yet.
So until we get a proper test for keeping dentries in the dcache
fix the current d_revalidate method by completely removing it.  This
returns us to the current status quo.
So with CONFIG_NETNS=n things should look as they have always looked.
For CONFIG_NETNS=y things work most of the time but there are a few
rare corner cases that don't behave properly.  As the network namespace
is barely present in 2.6.24 this should not be a problem.
