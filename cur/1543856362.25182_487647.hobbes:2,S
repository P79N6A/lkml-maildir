Subject: Confusing stream of atkbd messages after failed boot

On upgrading to 2.6.19, I didn't bother reading the release notes, did
a "make oldconfig", and rebooted. The boot failed (since the SATA
.config options had been moved) and I was presented with a continous
stream of error messages:
atkbd.c: Spurious ACK on isa0060/serio
  Some program might be trying to access hardware directly.
These seem to be as a result of the keyboard LEDs being flashed.
They cause the real error message:
Cannot open root device
and the preceding kernel messages which show a lack of detection of
the SATA hard drive to be rapidly scrolled off screen.
The atkbd message should at the very least be rate limited.
