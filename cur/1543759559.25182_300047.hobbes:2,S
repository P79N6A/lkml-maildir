I have seen exactly the same thing and concluded that S4bios is broken.
Since it is tricky to set up (you usually need a special hibernation
partition or a special file in a FAT partition) and probably slow as
hell (at least if it has anything to do with the APM BIOS suspend to
disk routines, and i assume it does), i'd shed no tears if it would go
away ;-)
