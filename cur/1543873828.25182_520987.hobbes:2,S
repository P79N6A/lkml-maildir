That's an interesting idea.  Have you or anyone else looked at what it
would take to code up?
For this case, I guess you'd walk the relocs looking for references into
the paravirt_ops structure.  You'd need to check that was a reference
from an indirect jump or call instruction, which would identify a
patchable callsite.  The offset into the pv_ops structure would identify
which operation is involved.  That would be enough to use the existing
paravirt_ops patch machinery to insert a patch, though it doesn't
provide quite as much information as the current scheme.  The current
scheme also tells us how much space is available for patching over, and
what registers the patched-in code can use/clobber.
What are the netdev requirements?
