Lap complete :) Theory? uh erm it's rather involved but basically instead of 
working off the accumulated sleeping ticks gathered in ten seconds it works 
on the accumulated sleeping ticks gathered till it wakes up. It has non 
linear semantics to cope with the fact that you cant accumulate 10 seconds 
worth of ticks (for example) if only 10 seconds has passed (likewise for less 
time). Also idle tasks are no longer considered fully interactive but idle 
and receive no boost or penalty. Finally they all start with some sleep ticks 
inherited by their parent as though they have been running for 1 second at 
least.

I have (at least) one more trick up my sleeve which might help this, but this 
time I really do want some time to pass and more people test it (in -mm) 
before making another change.
