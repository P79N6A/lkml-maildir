While I 100% agree with you on this, I'd like to note that I don't agree
with the following statement :
> also explains why you see better results is writeout starts earlier.
The results should be better when writeout starts later since most of
the transfer will have been performed at RAM speed. That's what happens
with the user above with 2 GB RAM. But in case of the VAIO with 512 MB,
there's really something strange IMHO. I suspect it has two RAM areas,
one fast and one slow (probably one two large non-cacheable area for a
shared video or such a crap, which can be avoided when reducing the
cache size).
Best regards,
Willy
