Thanks for the reminder Thomas, you're correct that pci=noacpi is
broken, see 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1219
Note that pci=noacpi is a bug workaround.
It is a bug when a platform requires it.  The bug should be filed, root
caused, and fixed.  If you know of such platforms, please be encouraged
to file bugs with the details so we can get to the bottom of it.
thanks,
