Ah yes indeed. I'm unable to keep up with all the new developments. :-(
However, if my understanding of this code is correct, it seems that the
page fault is only done for shared writable VMAs, so you still can't
rely on set_page_dirty() always being called by the process that
dirtied the page in the first place.
Am I wrong?
