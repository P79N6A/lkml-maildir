There are two behaviours to handle. One is the standard dup2() one, where 
you pass a "newfd" by saying that you want "oldfd" exactly on top of 
"newfd". With the new sys_dup2() you can pass an fd inside the 
unsequential area, and have the same behviour of the legacy dup2().
The other one, unique to unsequential fds, is asking the kernel to just 
allocate a free one from the unsequential map, whatever it is.
So we need a flag, that is "far enough" from the unsequential map 
allocation space. I was actually thinking of moving FD_UNSEQ_BASE down to
(1 << 27) or (1 << 26), and leave some more space for flags.
128M or 64M of descriptors should be enough for the legacy, sequential fd 
allocator ;)

Will do today.

Makes sense for me, since sys_socket() is the primary source of fds 
wherever you have fd-crowded applications. And those definitely aren't 
using select() ;)
I seem to remember, that either you or Uli, talked about task-private fds, 
although I do not remember the context. A close-on-fork flag?
