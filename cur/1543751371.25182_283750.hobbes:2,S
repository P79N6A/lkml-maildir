This is a known problem with -mm1 and the ALSA people already fixed it.
The change log for -mm2 indicates it should be in that version.
A work around is to ENABLE power management. Another possible solution
is to apply the patch I already provided in a lkml email message. See
http://groups-beta.google.com/group/linux.kernel/attach/4fc6393590a2fa25/ac97-fix-nopm.patch?part=2
for the patch or
http://groups-beta.google.com/group/linux.kernel/browse_frm/thread/191dcbdb2db8683a/10b2db7bba380ae4#10b2db7bba380ae4
for the context of the email exchange. This is NOT the same fix the ALSA
people provided - but it worked for me.
