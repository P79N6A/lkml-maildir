Does just fine include unambiguously?  Sure, standards-conforming
UTF-8 is unambiguous, but you've already said time and again that that
doesn't happen in the real world.  I just don't agree on the UTF-8 can
store UCS-4 characters just fine thing _at all_.

At the end of the day, I just don't see how your suggestion of leaving
UTF-8 undecoded unless you're presenting it to the user is ever going
to be practical, which brings us back to my first point, that UTF-8
can't, in the real world, represent UCS-4 characters acceptably,
(I.E. unambiguously).

I don't particularly like UCS-4, I do care about backwards
compatibility, and addressed it right from the begining.
..and I totally don't get the bit about "non-normalised" UTF-8 being
what allows backwards compatibility.  Compatibility with what!?
Existing broken implementations?  Real, standards compliant UTF-8 is
fully backwards compatible with 7-bit ASCII, which is really just
about all any standard which wants to get accepted as a universal
standard can hope to be compatible with.
