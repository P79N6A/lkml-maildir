Subject: [-mm patch] i386: enable REGPARM by default

This patch should _not_ go into Linus' tree.
At some time in the future, we want to unconditionally enable REGPARM on 
i386.
Let's give it a bit broader testing coverage among -mm users.
This patch:
- removes the dependency of REGPARM on EXPERIMENTAL
- let REGPARM default to y
This patch assumes that people who use -mm are willing to test some more 
experimental features.
After this patch, REGPARM is still a config option users can disable.

 	Compile the kernel with -mregparm=3. This uses a different ABI
