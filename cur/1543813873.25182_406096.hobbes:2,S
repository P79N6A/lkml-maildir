Your point is well noted.  I'm not arguing that it would be smart to 
test with just one hypervisor (or worse, yet, test only on native 
hardware), and proudly declare your kernel virtualization compatible.  
There are some things you can do (instrument a torture test verification 
module in a native VMI ROM) to help with that test load.
But in the end, having a single binary reduces the complexity and work 
that goes into a certification, which does simplify the process - even 
if you still have to validate against the list of all supported vendors 
/ hardware.
