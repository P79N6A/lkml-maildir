There is a utility (name escapes me) which allows binding of a NIC to a 
name by MAC address, it would be nice to be able to bind by serial 
number for IDE/SCSI/USB devices. However, until you do that, a simple 
script to create a few symlinks after discovery will solve your problem. 
Doesn't bug me enough to bother, but that's how.
