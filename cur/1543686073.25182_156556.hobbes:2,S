It's a bad choice of name.  X_to_Y() normally implies that X and Y are
basically different representations of the same thing (e.g., a page
pointer vs. a virtual address).  However, virt_to_pageoff() is a
one-way translation, so it's misleading.  In my opinion, it should be
called page_offset() or something like that.
