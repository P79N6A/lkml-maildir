Hi!
Hauke Steenbock (steenbo@informatik.uni-bremen.de) and me (punk@informatik.uni-bremen.de)
are working on ACLs for ext2 for a universitary project (LiVE). 
We started with the (ongoing AFAIK) work from Remy Card, fixed some bug, 
and returned it to Remy Card.
We almost finished adaption to POSIX 1003.6 Draft 17 and are planning
to add some nice features perhaps. But time is short because the
end of our universitary project is near (about midst to third quarter this year).
For more information see

P.S:
Non-authoritative answer, Remy Card is authoritative for ext2.
