I'll calm down and work on my magicpoint slides for now.

Of course IANAL but it seems to me, the more similar things we find the
better.  I think you have to find essentially all the key ideas
pre-existing in one piece of work to have a good piece of prior art,
it's my understanding.  Now of course that sucks, and the whole patent
system sucks, but that's how the game is played.  Of course, we have
other options in this case.  Naturally, I intend to show exactly what my
prior work was, but I'm waiting to hear words from the lawyer first.
I'm also waiting to hear from NetApp management, publicly or privately. 
I know they're aware of this, and have been for some time.  We've
already heard from one right-thinking NetApp employee as I'm sure you're
aware.  I don't think I should contact NetApp privately, not before I've
had legal advice.
