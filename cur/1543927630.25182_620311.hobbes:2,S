I think that is pretty insightful, and indeed, is probably the only
reason we would ever consider using a virtio based driver.
But is this really a virtualization problem, and is virtio the right
place to solve it?  Doesn't I/O hotplug with multipathing or NIC teaming
provide the same infrastructure in a way that is useful in more than
just a virtualization context?
