Ya, I looked at it and its looking very good tool to tracing block I/O
layer, but this tracing requires recompilation of the kernel and have
to use on kernel directly from kernel.org but its not a big deal, I
hope it will get into the main kernel soon ....
By the way my approach about creating wrapper and getting the device
requests without modification into the kernel and can be easily used
on any block device ...... ;)
