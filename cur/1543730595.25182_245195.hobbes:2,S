Oh thanks that helps to understand what happened.
(BTW, regarding the atomicity in that discussion: could the code like
 rtc.c (assuming it has also SA_SHIRQ) really cause deadlock?)
Anyway, suppressing the unnecessary call of add_interrupt_randomness()
should be still valid.  The reduced patch is below.
