Thats correct - in raid mode the controller emulates an IDE controller
but is doing all the work (its actually hardware raid) and it doesn't
support multisector PIO stuff (not that this matters for DMA). The -u1
and -d1 are the two that matter

fix up the IT8212 misreporting of DMA a little too late for the generic
code to decide to turn DMA on.
