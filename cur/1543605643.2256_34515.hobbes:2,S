Hi
(I am sorry if this question has been asked and answered before)
How do you increase the number of system call parameters, and how many
can you at most have?
Would up to 12 parameters be possible, and how?
I have looked at asm-i386/unistd, but it does not seem as intuitive as for
some other processors (and I am still soon going to learn x86...).
Are changes other places needed?
