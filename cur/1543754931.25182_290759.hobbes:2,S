I've defined this function.  I'm not sure if it really works, but it 
looks good.
#include <linux/pagemap.h>
void put_user_pages(int len, struct page **pages)
{
         int i;
         for (i=0; i<len; i++) {
                 if (!PageReserved(pages[i])) {
                         SetPageDirty(pages[i]);
                 }
                 page_cache_release(pages[i]);
         }
}
