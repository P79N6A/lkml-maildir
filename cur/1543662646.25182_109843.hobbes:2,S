Several people have said that, and it's completely NOT TRUE.
The thing about sigfd() has _nothing_ to do with sending packets, and 
everything to do with the fact that you _associate_ signals with the thing 
that you get the packets from.
Sure, the code could associate signals with a netlink fd instead. But 
netlink is not actually a very good abstraction in my opinion - it has 
another layer of code (the network layer) between it and the user, which 
dos not add any value.

We'd need the same new system call - the one to associate signals of this 
process with the netlink thing.
(Yeah, the "system call" could be an ioctl entry, but quite frankly, 
that's much WORSE than adding a system call. It's just system calls 
without type checking).
