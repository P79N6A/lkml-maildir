Interesting question. I also thought about that one. However,
regarding X, the machine sometimes crashes before the X Server
screensaver (nothing special there, just the built in one that turns
the screen black) is clearing the screen and sometimes afterwards. If
it crashes afterwards, I can of course not see when it crashed, since
I don't see the clock on the screen anymore.
And there's nothing else which I could think of. I have resetted the
spinout time for the harddisks to "never" (for different reasons) and
I don't think that there's any power saving stuff enabled in BIOS
setup. I'll check that. However, I'm afraid there really isn't any
screensaver or powersaving thing within my system, of course for the
standard X screensaver, which doesn't seem related to it.
Regards,
Julien
