Provided the executable remains unmodified (security model in OS this was
implemented on was quite different; no access to raw devices or filesystem
change times) the security info is cached.  One method I see is attaching
watchdogs to privledged files to trap modifications or just flat out
prevent (+i) modifications to a privledged executable to make caching more
effective.  But how many executables are you going to have with elevated
permissions anyway?
