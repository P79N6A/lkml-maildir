Hello all,
Building the fglrx module against the current Linux kernel (2.6.20.7 as 
of this e-mail) I'm getting an error:
FATAL: modpost: GPL-incompatible module fglrx.ko uses GPL-only symbol 
'paravirt_ops'
which looks like someone (ATI?) might be doing something funny.  I'm 
just curious what the error means.. paravirt_ops is bit of the new 
virtualization code, correct?
Anyway, I'm curious if it's interesting or "nothing to see here, move 
along". I'm not looking for any kind of "fix" as the module itself not 
building isn't a kernel dev issue (currently having trouble with the 
Xorg Radeon drivers, but that's another story).
It just seemed like it might be interesting and I couldn't find anything 
to shed light on the error itself in the mailing list logs, and I'm 
curious at what's happening.
Thanks,
-- Chris
