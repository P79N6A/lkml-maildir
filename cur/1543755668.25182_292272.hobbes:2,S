I don't think this will be a problem.  The separation between code
and the rest of the book is clear, and the book isn't directly 
executable. :-)
Even a book that mainly list source and merely offer some short explanations
should be easy to get right - the _code_ is GPL so it is okay for people to
photocopy it off the pages (who in their right mind would, though) but
the rest of the book is printed under ordinary terms.
