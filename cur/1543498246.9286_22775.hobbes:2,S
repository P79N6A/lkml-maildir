Yes, and Apache 2.0 will no doubt be more optimized for this kind of
benchmark.
On the other hand, these benchmarks aren't meaningless.  Each
bottleneck they run into might be a real-world bottleneck for
some application.  In fact, all of the improvements I list
in 
http://www.kegel.com/mindcraft_redux.html
 appear to
have been made in the course of normal Linux development.
Improving Apache+Linux's performance on these silly benchmarks
has thus been a side effect of useful stuff.
