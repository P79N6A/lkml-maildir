I figured it out! I thought you might be interested --- the reason is the 
mismatch between the default mount options stored in the superblock on 
disk and the filesystem features compiled into the kernel.
Namely, dumpe2fs on the offending filesystems showed the following default 
mount options:
user_xattr acl
but on good filesystems it showed "(none)". So, I used "tune2fs -o ^acl"
(and ^user_xattr) to clear these in the superblock and mounted the 
filesystem --- and now mkdir system call works as expected, i.e. 
honours the umask.
Maybe the ext3 filesystem should automatically detect this (the mismatch) 
and printk a warning so the user is told that his filesystem is mounted in 
extremely insecure way, i.e. making directories as root will result in 
lots of 0777 places (e.g. try "make modules_install" --- this will create 
lots of security holes in /lib/modules).
I cc'd linux-kernel as someone may wish to fix this. (see below for the 
actual report).
Kind regards
Tigran
