I have ALSA working under 2.4.21-rc1 using Erik's kernel patch, but I 
cannot get it to work under 2.5.69. I don't know what's wrong. I get 
Audio from my CD-ROM since it is connected to my sound card, but I get 
no sound from the Arts sound server in KDE. I get no errors and no warnings.
I don't understand how it can't work. I'm thinking that the OSS 
emulation is broken. The ALSA version I have for 2.4 is 0.9.2. 0.9.3a is 
in 2.5.69, right? Have any bugs been reported to the ALSA people?

David
