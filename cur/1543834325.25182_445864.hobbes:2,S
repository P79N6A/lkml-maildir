The Linux kernel sometimes looses developers.
That seems to unavoidable, there are there are always problems like:
- Some developers leave the projects if their code was rejected because 
  it didn't match the standards and policies of the project.
- Some developers leave the project if other people's code that didn't 
  match the standards and policies of the project was accepted.
