i updated my simple rlimit patch.  it displays "unlimited" in the proper
cases, and the code is reorganized.
my latest buffer cache instrumentation patch is also available.  it turns
off my changes to the buffer algorithms by default, so applying it just
gives the instrumentation.  i encourage large systems admins to apply this
patch and reply to me with statistics you get.  simply tail
/var/log/messages and use the magic <alt>-<sysrq>-M key sequence.
you can find them here:
