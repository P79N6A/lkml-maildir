Minor nit: please put such forward declarations right at the top of the
header file.
Otherwise someone might come along later and require task_struct at line
100.  They'll then add another forward-declaration at line 95 and so on. 
This has happened in the past.
I updated the patch to do this.
diff -puN include/linux/lockdep.h~lockdep-forward-declare-struct-trask_struct include/linux/lockdep.h
--- a/include/linux/lockdep.h~lockdep-forward-declare-struct-trask_struct
+++ a/include/linux/lockdep.h

 #ifndef __LINUX_LOCKDEP_H
 #define __LINUX_LOCKDEP_H
 
+struct task_struct;

 #ifdef CONFIG_LOCKDEP
 
 #include <linux/linkage.h>

Note that it's outside CONFIG_LOCKDEP, to avoid possible
hey-my-build-broke-when-i-turned-off-lockdep problems.
