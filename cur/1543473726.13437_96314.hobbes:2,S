Subject: 2.2.0pre1-ac3 how do I enable bootpd/dhcpd agent support?

I'm trying to run dhcpd on 2.2.0pre1-ac3, and can't find how to enable the
bootp-agent support.  The dhcpd docs say to "echo 1 >
/proc/net/ipv4/ip_bootpd_agent" (or something like that).
However, I can't find "ip_bootp_agent" anywhere in /proc.  Actually, all I
can find is bootp_relay flags in the conf/[eth0|pppd0|lo0] directories.
Is this something that is enabled in "make config" in the networking
options?
