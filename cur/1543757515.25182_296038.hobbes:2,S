In theory, it should mean that even with the PS/2 spec. But it only
works so in the other direction - when the PC doesn't get the bytes
right.
The devices use this error code for any problem, and this of course
would lead to infinite loops if the system did always resend.

And did it actually help? Did the touchscreen ever respond with a 0xfa
"ACK, OK" response to these commands?
