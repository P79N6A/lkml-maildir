Hi there!
I am very new to Linux kernel and if this is a question which is not for
this mailing list, please let me know.
I am trying to debug the kernel 2.6.11.2 with KGDB. I was able to
successfully debug linux kernel 2.6.7 on two machines (a P3, running as
a development machine, and the other is a dual Xeon 32-bit running as a
test machine) but I'm not able to configure 2.6.11.2 to enable KGDB.
There are no options available to enable KGDB (as opposed to 2.6.7) when
I run 'make menuconfig'. The kgdb.sourceforge.net site has kgdb patch
for 2.6.7 and not for later versions. Are there any patches or hooks
available to enable KGDB for linux-2.6.11.2? 
I would really appreciate if someone could guide on the above query?
Thanks for your help,
Sameer
