If and only if letting them do so is zero cost to us.  Otherwise what you
are asking is that we spend money and not take in money.  Doesn't make 
sense.  And I don't think the BK docs are good enough that it would cost
us zero dollars to roll out a new customer.

When you cross the 25 developer line, if tar+diff are working for you
then there is no price where BK makes sense for you.
