I've been running kernel du jour straight from git on my SPARC Ultra 1 for
some time now on Aurora Corona (Fedora relative, development branch). For a
few days now 2.6.19 panics on boot, it can't mount /. 2.6.19 worked fine,
as does 2.6.19.1 (Aurora changed gcc, mkinitrd, ... in between, so I had to
rebuild a kernel to check if the problem lay elsewhere). Unpacking the
initrds for 2.6.19 and 2.6.19.1 shows the same (nash script) /init and the
same modules in both (ext3 + jbd, scsi_mod, sd_mod, esp, others).
I'm stumped. Any clue?
