Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Fix some return value truncation problems on file writes.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

During some testing, it was noted that writing more than 2GB using
fwrite() to a file on tmpfs would continue to retry the write()
syscall until the entire filesystem was full.  I was then encouraged
to verify XFS, ext2, ext3, reiserfs, and pipe.  The only other
problem noted was from reiserfs with direct I/O.  I did not test
the direct I/O code change.
Thanks,
Robin Holt
