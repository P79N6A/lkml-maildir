Thanks for all of your responses.  They have helped alot.  The best
solution i've found is to allow hard links and charge the quotas of all
the parent directories.  I originally thought of this as a bad idea,
simply because the total sum of the quotas isn't really allocated (part
of the point of hard links is to compress the amount of on-disk data),
but it does seem to be the only solution so far that makes any sense.
I would also only charge the parent directory once if two links were in
the same directory, since that would still allow the use of hard links
as compression.
I will also be posting the website for the filesystem (charon) within
the next couple weeks, so if anyone is interested please let me know and
I'll send the URL as soon as it's up!
    Mike
