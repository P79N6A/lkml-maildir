Some slab change, perhaps? There's nothing special about the init_bio()
slab call:
        bio_slab = kmem_cache_create("bio", sizeof(struct bio), 0,
                            SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN|SLAB_PANIC, NULL, NULL);
Hmm, this looks strange. That bug happens if:
        if ((!name) ||
                in_interrupt() ||
                (size < BYTES_PER_WORD) ||
                (size > (1<<MAX_OBJ_ORDER)*PAGE_SIZE) ||
                (dtor && !ctor)) {
                        printk(KERN_ERR "%s: Early error in slab %s\n",
                                        __FUNCTION__, name);
                        BUG();
                }
It must be in_interrupt() triggering, perhaps something change in the
boot sequence?
