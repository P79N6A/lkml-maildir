That's what I strongly suspected.

They just hacked "usbnet".  There are huge chunks of code, and comments,
that are clearly identical.  At least half of the "moschip" driver.

"M Subrahmanya Srihdar" didn't "accidentally" copy the bulk of usbnet, remove all
the attributions, and replace them ... not possible.  There were certainly a few
chip-specific additions of course, right where "usbnet" expects them, but the
core driver is obviously all "usbnet" code.
