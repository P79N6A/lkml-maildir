Sorry for jumping in late... there is basically no way to know whether 
you are on AC or DC, unless you have a *really smart* power supply. 
Embedded or near-embedded devices usually have a "12V DC" connector on 
the mainboard. "Home" use usually requires a small PSU as are common for 
laptops to transform from 230V to whatever is needed. So the mainboard 
technically is always on 12VDC (what could be called "DC"), even if you 
power it up with using the 230VAC->12VDC PSU (what people call "AC").
