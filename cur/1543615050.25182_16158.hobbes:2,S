It might be because you didn't do a 'make mrproper' on a kernel tree
you've used before for a non-preempt build.  As I understand it the
preempt patch effectively makes your kernel SMP - this changes the
architecture of the kernel so you need a 'make mrproper'.
make mrproper deletes your .config file so save that first if you
wanted it ;-)
Also you need a seperate modules directory - the preempt modules
aren't compatible with non-preempt.  Edit the top level makefile and
put a suffix in.
BTW The preempt patch is working fine here too!
