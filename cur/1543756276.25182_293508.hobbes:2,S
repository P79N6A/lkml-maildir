Hi Randy,
thanks for the reply.
My apologies for not including the kernel version ( that's what you get 
when you try to go too fast ;)
You were right, i'm running 2.4.29 !
I don't know about the resources assignments needed by this timer. I 
tried to get the spec sheets for the chipset from the via site but i was 
not able to find it ( i did not spend hours looking tough ).
I was wondering if someone had the info out there !
Right now i'm just not taking into account the failure of the 
request_region and everything works fine. But i wanted to make it clean 
so ... i'll have to dig deeper into this i guess !
