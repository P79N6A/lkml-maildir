How true.
# pwd
/usr/src2/uClibc-0.9.26
# grep -r X11R6 .
./ldso/ldso/readelflib1.c:                      UCLIBC_RUNTIME_PREFIX "usr/X11R6/lib:"
./utils/ldd.c:  path =  UCLIBC_RUNTIME_PREFIX "usr/X11R6/lib:"
./utils/ldconfig.c:         scan_dir(UCLIBC_RUNTIME_PREFIX "/usr/X11R6/lib");
./libpthread/linuxthreads/README.Xfree3.2:This file describes how to make a threaded X11R6.
./libpthread/linuxthreads/README.Xfree3.2:You need the source-code of XFree-3.2. I used the sources of X11R6.1
./libpthread/linuxthreads/README.Xfree3.2:cp XF3.2/xc/lib/*/*.so.?.? /usr/X11R6/lib/
./libpthread/linuxthreads/README.Xfree3.2:cd /usr/X11R6/lib/
./Changelog:    o Made the lib loader also support libs in /usr/X11R6/lib by default
This should be removed.
cd /usr/lib; ln -s /usr/X11R6/* .
	or
echo /usr/X11R6/lib >>/etc/ld.so.conf
are the better ways to handle this
(I use first one)
