The completion is currently used to return an error code for errors that 
happen during initialization in the threads (open socket, allocate 
memory). We could move the setup code out of the threads and have them 
only run an error-safe loop.

Thanks, now using schedule_timeout with wake_up_process.

When the setup code has been moved out of the threads, the code gets much 
simpler.

Thanks.
