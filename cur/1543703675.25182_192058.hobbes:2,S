Hello,
Last week I tried to get aacraid working under 2.6.1, which failed.  In
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/must-fix/must-fix-7.txt
 it
says:
	o ideraid hasn't been ported to 2.5 at all yet.
	  We need to understand whether the proposed BIO split code will suffice
	  for this.
So that explains the non-working part in 2.6. In 2.4.24 is worked out of the
box, so I'm running that now.
My question: is there _any_ ETA on when this stuff is going to work in 2.6?
Could you please CC me on answers? I'm only reading the digest. Thanks,
grtz
      Miek
