Well "date" won't hang but you won't actually see any output for it on the
XTerm.
But I'm unclear how switching to VT1 is going to work since that requires that
X capture the VT keypress. If X is hung and not responding to keyboard and
mouse inputs it's not going to see that keypress either and isn't going to
switch.
I think the best way to test in this situation is to SSH in from another
machine and run commands like this over SSH. Even better would be a serial
console.
