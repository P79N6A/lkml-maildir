Hi all...
New announcement of the -jam patches. While we all await for a real
-aa1 from Andrea, here goes an -jam0 (ie, not -jam1), with -aa
patch ported. It runs fine on my box.
Additions since last release (see README for credits...):
- reverted the fast-pte part of -aa. Still have to try again
  to see if it is more stable now.
- force-inline patch.
- 4M queue size for block writes
- P4 prefetching
- Orlov inode allocator for 2.4
- BProc 3.2.3
(btw, I have bee looking for orlov for ext2 - it exists ? -
 and htree for ext2/3. Any pointers ? )
As always, get it at:
