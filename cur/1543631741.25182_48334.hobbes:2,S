Good luck making that stick in court.  First of all, the RTAI guys have
admitted over and over that RTAI is a fork of the RTLinux source base.
Your claims that that isn't true are countered by principles from both
parties in question.  Second of all, both source bases have evolved 
since the fork.  Whether your script catches the common heritage or 
not has no meaning, the fact remains that one is derived from the
other, and as such has to be GPLed.
