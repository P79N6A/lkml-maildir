That's quite debatable.  'all' does do the right thing on ppc32.

True.  A patch to add that bit 'o help to the archhelp target would
happily be reviewed.

What I don't see is why:
'znetboot - Build a zImage and put into /tftpboot/
 uImage - Build an image for U-Boot
 rom.img - Build an image to live on ROM
 srec - Build an SREC image'
etc, isn't sufficient, in the archhelp.  Especially with a note added to
the boards for the corner cases where all isn't correct (foo-board only
supports U-Boot, so you should use uImage to get things working
directly).

Without stepping too much into the what belongs in the kernel debate,
you've already got lots of board-specific things to handle, so if it's
already documented.

Which gets back to one of Russells points.  You can document the formats
all you want, but that won't help the user pick one, unless they already
know enough to not need this information to start with.
Or, you restrict their choices to what would work, which is a horrible
mess.  And you may need to restrict the choices, otherwise we'll get
'allyesconfig' doesn't build type messages again (yes, I've already had
to re-arrange things once for allyesconfig on ppc32).

<nit>'correct' is such an odd word here.  Especially in the case where
all of them are valid targets.</nit>
