I agree with you.  I hate files being modified without mtime changing,
and the mmap(2) man page is so surprisingly specific about those times
that I bet the text comes directly from one of the standards.
It's not something I'm rushing to fix; but I've made a note to
look at it later (days not hours) if nobody else gets there first.
It may turn out to be too difficult to get right - mmap and [amc]time
don't fit well together; but that text you've noticed at least gives
something to aim for - thanks.
Hugh
