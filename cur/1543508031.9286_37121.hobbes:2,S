Dear Folks,
	Running a 2.2.11 kernel configured with every sound
thing either as yes or module I expected the sound card
problems to disappear. Fat (slim?) chance. My speakers still
whistle continually. Not loud, but nasty high pitched in the
background. I get noises that settle down to this whining
whistle as the PCMCIA and scsi are probed and the Philips
Omniwriter 26 is recognized during boot.
	Below is the only SB specific data from dmesg.
> 
> Soundblaster audio driver Copyright (C) by Hannu Savolainen 1993-1996
> SB 4.16 detected OK (220)
> SB16: Bad or missing 16 bit DMA channel
> AWE32: not detected
> 
	I e-mailed this to umb because I get to the net via
ISP and netscape which is doing wierd mail things right now.
	Are there some specific kernel drivers that will
recognize a SB AWE64 sound card? Are there tweaks for the
driver listed above that will allow the stuff being looked for
to appear to the kernel at boot? Is there some missing config
that will stop the feed through from the Philips Omniwriter 26?
	I know this is the source because it disappears when I
power off the Omniwriter and it reappears, changed, when I
power it on again. It then settles down to the same whining
whistle.
	Shalom,
	John B. Brown.
