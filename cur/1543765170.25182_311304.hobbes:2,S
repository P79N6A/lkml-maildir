A kernel feature may require a different (bigger, slower, ...) internal data
structure, which isn't desired unless you use that feature. Or it will
change the semantics of some functions, e.g. functions being a noop (and
optimized away) for uniprocessor with no highmem will do some important
task on a SMP machine with 4 GB.
