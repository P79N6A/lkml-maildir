That is odd, I usually find the quality of output to be much
better plugging directly in to the drive. Bad drive ;)

Yes, they do vary a lot.

In that case it does not fail, the drive just does not honor the
specifications. More below.

Ah, I see what you mean.

Well, that depends on whether the drive internally keeps the volume
either at 0/0xff or the value we sent it. The one case I saw set the
volume to 0xff for any volume setting, so in that case we can
detect whether it honors the volume setting or not.
