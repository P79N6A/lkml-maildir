First, sorry if you replied to my other mail. I forgot to activate the
e-mail address, should work now.
I run some of my programs on 2.6.0-test3 this morning, before my coffee
..., anyhow seems dnotify isn't working any more. I compiled the example
from <linux-2.6.0-test3>/Documentation/dnotify.txt this also doesn't
work anymore.
SMP <2 PIII> system.
As usual CC me, if possible :-).
