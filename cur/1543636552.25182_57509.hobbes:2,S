You check printf() and fprintf() then? Like this?
///////////////////////////////////////////
void err_print(int err){
  const char *msg;
  int rc;
  msg = strerror(err);
  if(!msg) err_print(errno);
  do{
    rc = fprintf(stderr,"Problem: %s\n",msg);
  }while(rc<0 && errno==EINTR);
  if(rc<0) err_print(errno);
}
