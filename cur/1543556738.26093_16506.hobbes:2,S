is it clear to you? it is not clear to me, or rather the opposite seems
clear. This is what the code looks like (in 2.4):
struct file * get_empty_filp(void)
{
        static int old_max = 0;
        struct file * f;
        file_list_lock();
        if (files_stat.nr_free_files > NR_RESERVED_FILES) {
        used_one:
                f = list_entry(free_list.next, struct file, f_list);
                list_del(&f->f_list);
                files_stat.nr_free_files--;
so, a normal user is only allowed to allocate from the freelist when the
number of elements on the freelist is > NR_RESERVED_FILES. I do not see
how you are able to take elements from the freelist when the number is <
NR_RESERVED_FILES unless you are a super-user, i.e. current->euid == 0.
Btw, while you are there (in 2.2 kernel) you may want to fix the
/proc/sys/fs/file-nr -- it is broken because it assumes that nr_files,
nr_free_files, max_files are allocated by the compiler at consecutive
addresses. I have fixed this for 2.4 ages ago but couldn't be bothered
with 2.2.x...
