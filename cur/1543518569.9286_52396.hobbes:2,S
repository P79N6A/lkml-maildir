gcc has an handy extension to handle that.
struct foobar_op my_ops {
		open: my_open,
		close: my_close,
		nopage: my_nopage
};
The rest is simply filled with NULL.
 
If you look closely it is already used successfully in lots of kernel modules.
C99 has a similar extension, unfortunately incompatible	( .field = instead of
field: ). I guess adopting the gcc syntax that was in the field for years
would have been too easy.
Sometimes we want to break the source though. When the semantics of
the interface change then a human should look at it. A lot of people
didn't get this e.g. from 2.0 -> 2.2, mindlessly doing a global
search-replace from memcpy_fromfs to copy_from_user, although this was
not correct because it needed to be fixed to check for the return 
value too.
