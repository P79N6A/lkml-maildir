Yes, it is one of the reason we should evaluate _STA before evaluating
_STA. Maybe you're referring '1023' as a _STA value on Fujitsu server,
but it is _SUN value. If a driver evaluate _SUN even if its corresponding
_STA is 0, Fujitsu firmware returns '1023' as a _SUN value. The reason why
Fujitsu firmware is doing so is because ACPI doesn't provide a way to
return errors in this situation.

Yes. I thought it's a goot idea too. But it doesn't work because ACPI2.0
based HP's machines also want Alex's driver to ignore _STA.
