OK, thanks.  That's important work.  After all, this patch is a performance
optimisation.

kswapd uses an old API.

kthread_bind() should be able to do this.  From a quick read it appears to
have shortcomings in this department (it expects to be bound to a single
CPU).
We should fix kthread_bind() so that it can accomodate the kscrub/kswapd
requirement.  That's one of the _reasons_ for using the provided
infrastructure rather than open-coding around it.
