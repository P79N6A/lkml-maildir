Yes, I know about the problem. I wasn't able to pin it down yet, though.
It looks like the keyboard might just 'forget' to send a key release.
This is not a problem on 2.4, since 2.4 uses the keyboard hardware
autorepeat. 2.5 does autorepeat in software and if the keyboard doesn't
send the release, well ...
But it might be a software problem, too. If you want to help, you can
run with I8042_DEBUG_IO enabled all the time and send me the log from
around the point in time when it happened.
