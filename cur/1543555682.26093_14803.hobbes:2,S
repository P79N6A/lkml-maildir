We agree that the "thread" is valid, trust that point.
There was a quick pointed question that present, "Is it an IDE disk?" to
paraphase the statement.

What may be even more helpful is when I get arround to making an option, 
for some outstanding patches for 2.5, that would allow for user-space
pattern pushing through the driver that gets properly inserted in to the
list/buffer-head to make it pass through the block layer.  This kind of
testing will allow for nibble level tracing through everything, I hope.
