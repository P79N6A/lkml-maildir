Well, not quite.  The problem is still there.  I have checked it a
little more closely though, and noticed that it isn't always there. 
Some virtual consoles have the problem and some don't.  It seems like
before I log in on a console, there's no problem.  And sometimes even
after logging in it is OK, but usually after I log in the green and
orange framebuffer mousepointer starts.
This is Red Hat 8.0, by the way.  I think it does something to the
console when I log in, the screen usually blanks for a second after I
enter the login password and before the bash prompt appears.

I found the sisfb web page and it is:
video=sisfb:mode:1024x768x24
and that works, but only at 60 HZ.  I haven't tried putting a "@75" on
the end yet...
Thanks again!
