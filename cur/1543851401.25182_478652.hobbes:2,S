You applied a nice lameness filter, by secretly making sure that -dyntick1
is unavailable and a new -dyntick2 took its place, right? ;)

Attached (went the extra mile and made sure to reply this night already).
It seems we have C2 APIC issues here, from a cursory glance at the log...
Note that it stalls directly after the
input: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard as /class/input/input0
line (from that point on it needs additional "support" via keyboard press).
Don't tell me my chipset is so awfully buggy that the best thing would be
to swap mainboards immediately...
Thanks!!
(especially for your nice dynticks work)
