It is one type of resource control. It is of course not a complete
solution like ckrm, but on machines with more than one node (or a
regular PC with numa emulation) it is possible to create partitions
using CPUSETS and then use this patch to control the amount of memory
that should be dedicated for say mapped pages on each node.
CKRM and CPUSETS are the ways to provide resource control today.
CPUSETS is coarse-grained, but CKRM aims for finer granularity. None
of them have a way to control the ratio between mapped and unmapped
pages, excluding this patch.
I'd like to see CKRM merged, but I'm not the one calling the shots
(probably fortunate enough for everyone). I think CKRM has the same
properties as the ClockPRO work - it would be nice to have it included
in mainline, but these patches modify lots of crital code and
therefore has problems getting accepted that easily.
So this patch is YASSITRD. (Yet Another Small Step In The Right Direction)
Thank you!
