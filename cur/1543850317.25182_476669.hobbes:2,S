Well, if the data is being copied to where userspace can get at it, and if MAC
is disabled, then it doesn't matter: root can always gain access if it wants
to, no matter what the DAC-related attributes are.
I'm quite happy to attach security data to the files in the cache, and use MAC
if it's available, but most of the time, it can't be the MAC-related attributes
of the process in who's context we're running.
