What is the recommended way for two drivers to share common code ?
Our device has two PCI functions and hence two drivers -  NIC and 
SCSI driver.   The source code for these dirvers will fit under 
drivers/net and drivers/scsi.  But both drivers share some common 
code.  If possible, I would like to avoid duplicating the common 
code under the two driver directories.   Is there any recommened 
way to organize such common  code ?  Thanks.
Subbu
