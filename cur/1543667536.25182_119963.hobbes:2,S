	The default agp speed  in X's radeon driver is 1(cvs from serveral
days) , and seems that X sets that mode. I may have a BIOS problem too
after boot agp speed is undefined, when set to 4 in bios, but in  Option
"AGPMode" "4" changes this, radeon 9000 , kt133 all ok, haven't digged furter.
I've looked at agp changes and this message was added soon there, so this 1x 
may be there from a long time. You can check what the mode is with lspci -vv
too, i've not tested with 2.4, but suspect that you'll see 1x there too.
