Could you elaborate a bit? This code is for pci-pc.c, it is platform 
specific.
Are there surprises on pc platform? What is visible behavour in this case?

I should be missing something here. You have 256M of physical address 
space at 0xe0000000 occupied.
You can do nothing with it, it is simply present. Then, ioremap maps it 
somewhere in high memory.
It should not conflict with kernel RAM, for which trivial mapping (+3G) 
used.

I am not expert here. I know that PCI-E bridge completes its transaction 
before data actually get to memory. Each intermediate bridge may do its 
own buffering. Besides read, I know nothing that will make you sure data 
reaches final destination. I'd appreciate if someone who knows better 
will step in. Config write is not very often procedure, I don't think 
extra read will make  any difference. I'll look for qualified person 
around, to consult on this issue.
