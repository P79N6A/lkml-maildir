I have an identical problem with my All-In-Wonder-Pro PCI 8MB.
If I follow the framebuffer instructions to the letter I get a black
screen, if I do what I do to make vesafb work properly (which it does) I
get a garbled screen. I've seent his problem in a minimum of 2.2.5,
2.2.11, 2.2.12 and 2.3.12. I haven't tried any more recent 2.3.x kernels
than that. But as said, vesafb works fine.
