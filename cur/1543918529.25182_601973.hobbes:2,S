How about a boot/module parameter to turn it on or off?
I don't see any point in having a sysctl for something like this: either
you have legacy applications or you don't. It is not something that you
switch off as you go off to lunch.
A compile parameter, OTOH, would be too restrictive since it would force
distros to choose just one behaviour (which would mean they would have
to choose the most conservative).
