Then as now you have not yet expalined what you are trying to do.
Nevertheless I look forward for a minmal set of patches that improve
whatever you are working with.
As for Kconfig the low hanging fruits are not in the tools but in the
structure of the Kconfig files. There are a lot that can be improved
with a decent effort but nobody has stepped up doing so.
The tools could be better too but if the root problem is the structure
of the Kconfig files this is where we should focus and not on the tools.
For Kbuild I fail to see anything that demand a rewrite from a structure
view of the Kbuild files.
The Kbuild internal stuff is antoehr story - here a rewrite to a saner
language then GNU make syntax could improve hackability a lot.
