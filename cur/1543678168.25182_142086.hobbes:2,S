I bought a DVD burner, that seems reasonably cost effective today, and I'm
hoping that hot swap IDE drives will be mature in a year or so. I've
swapped them by turning the whole cable off with hdparm, but it is *not* a
supported operation.
Maybe firewire/USB2.0 drives, the actual drives are reasonably cheap now.
Glad to see the fix, I have 4mm and 8mm tape.
