As Alan mentions in another thread, what is needed is true hotplug support, 
which is difficult with some controllers for which we have poor (or no) 
documentation. I wouldn't hold your breath.
As for pass-thru standby/sleep commands, as long as the pass-thru patch got 
into mainline, try a very recent version of hdparm which should understand 
sending the ATA commands over SCSI (libata).
