That is only in the poll_napi case, where netpoll tries to push pending
frames. The default caller for dev->poll() is net_rx_action.
We only ever get into this particular code branch in poll_napi when
the RX_SCHED bit is already set, ie someone put the device on the NAPI
poll_list and raised the softirq. poll_napi is just doing manually what
net_rx_action would do anyway once the softirq is serviced.

Sorry, I may be sitting on my brain this morning, but I don't understand
how skipping netif_rx_complete would affect ACKing of interrupts.
