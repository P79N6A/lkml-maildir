Several people are reporting long delays when shutting down and using
usb-storage.  My guess is that the control thread is getting killed during
the shutdown process, and when the SCSI layer decides to send a final
command to the device, it's never completed because the thread is dead.
So, how do I make a kernel thread immune from being killed during a
shutdown?

I don't have a left mouse button.  I only have one mouse and it's on my right.
