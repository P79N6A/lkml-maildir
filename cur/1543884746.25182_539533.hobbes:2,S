Sorry Manu,
incorrect link!
Why?
If you download the thing as tar.bz2 you get a zero file down.
However, if you download the thing as tar.gz you will succeed in getting it.
I'll sit down this evening, try to make changes to imply it into the actual mercurial tree, produce necessary patches and give you a bug report as far as the compilation errors are concerned.
I am really looking forward to see this fantastic thing finished....
It's worth it for a thousands of very good reasons, not only RAM optimization, but also stability and many many others...
So gimme some time, and perhaps please supply a tar.bz2 version if you can, or fix the download error (zero file) if there is any other reason that I cannot see.
OKIDOK so far?
Uwe
