This looks good. I have a few of comments:
- add read_lock_rcu() / read_unlock_rcu() around the loop in
  notifier_call_chain() to be preempt-safe.
- I would suggest using struct list_head in the notifier_block
  and use the RCU list routines from include/linux/list.h
  instead of spreading subtle RCU memory-barrier black magic.
- Even though RCU list reading is lockless, premption needs to
  be disabled while reading as mentioned above. So, we do
  need an __notifier_call_chain() version for those handlers
  that could sleep inside the handler: they will have to
  handle the required locking themselves.
