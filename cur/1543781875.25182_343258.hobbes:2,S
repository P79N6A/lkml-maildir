Hi Patrick,
If you want to call any kind of eh, *without* stalling IO to the host, you have
to know the context: LU or Domain Device or Domain,  in order to stall IO
to the context object only.

But remember, eh_timed_out and eh_strategy_handler point to
functions in the driver, so they can do more or less, depending.
BTW, you may be able to implement an _instantaneous_ canceling of
a command in the LLDD from any context, but this would bloat the
LLDD so much, that is is not a viable solution, plus it _cannot_
always be done (physically).
This is why eh_timed_out + eh_strategy_handler is a best current bet
for transport LLDD. (Given the current SCSI Core infrastructure.)
As far as the upper layers are concerned:
	- the command is either finished with status,
	- or the LU or the Device or the Domain had problems.
The above list is exhaustive, because if the task was never
able to be sent via the service delivery subsystem you'd
get a response, but the task will not "sit" in the LLDD.
Most importantly to remember is that a timed out command _cannot_
be returned instantaneously to SCSI Core, unless it is "complete"
in the SAM sense of the meaning.  If the task is out on the domain,
the respective eh needs to be invoked.

True, but this will bloat LLDD very much, and all you want of a
transport LLDD is access to the delivery subsystem as described in SAM.

Think of eh_timed_out as a replacement of the transport timeout
plus some delta.  Even if you had implemented it internally,
which you don't need to, you'd still get a timer to fire off
and you'd be in interrupt context.
As I mentioned earlier, if you've properly set the timeout value at
slave_configure, you shouldn't be getting SCSI Core calling your
eh_timed_out _unless_ the transport time out has kicked in, which
*you* set at slave configure time.
If, OTOH, SCSI Core _did_ call your eh_timed_out routine, this means
that the timeout which *you* set has kicked in and action needs
to be taken.  At that time, as per protocol, your task is either
complete or you need to go and find it and take the appropriate
action.

Yes, you can do this.  But in order to do this you'll need to know
_why_ the command failed.  Is it the LU or is it the Device or
is it the Domain.
The only one who can tell you this is the LLDD who talks to the
transport.
*Unless*, the LLDD exports SAM TMFs and SCSI Core knows what to call
and how, which is currently not the case.

Yes, you're completely right, the SCSI Core eh infrastructure is
incomplete. (I never mentioned I was gaining anything, I was merely
working around the current infrastructure. ;-) )
With the current infrastructure you cannot fine grain stalling
IO to the different storage objects, simply because SCSI Core
has _no representation for them_.
