	I don't think so.  Look again.  I deleted the declaration and
the assignment and replaced it with a declare and assign all at once.
The other pieces were like that and that one being inconsisent

	If you want to test it, get the version I posted later
in this thread.  It has some fixes like declaring some functions

mailed to you, let me know.
	Let me know how it works.
