Yeah yeah not the best place...if you know a better one, pass this along.
There was some dicussion about linux 2.2, libc2.1 and how staroffice needed
libc 2.0.7 awhile ago. I never remember a good solution to this coming out.
If there still isn't something better, I've come up with this:
sed s/libc.6.so/libc-star/g 
On all the staroffice libs and binaries. (Or possibly just a few offending
ones??) libc-star is a renamed libc-2.0.7.so, and get's dumped in
/usr/local/lib. This also needs to be done for any other conflicting parts.
(ld-linux.so.2 ??) Remember the name of the replacment lib
MUST be the SAME length as the original or the bin will get FUBARed.
Someone with the desire could whip up a script to automate this pretty quickly.
This should also work for anyother apps that made the same mistake as SO.
