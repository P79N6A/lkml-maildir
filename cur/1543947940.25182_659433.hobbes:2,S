Hi Andrew - would you add this to your -mm patchset?  It fixes a
possible panic.
(I based it on 2.6.25-rc2 + 2.6.25-rc2-mm1 + my patches from broken-out-0223
as I could not get 2.6.25-rc2 + all of broken-out-0223 to apply.)
Thanks, Mike

Built and tested: (x86_64) defconfig, nonum, nosmp (*).
Built: (x86_64) all{yes,mod}config,
       (i386) defconfig, all{yes,mod}config, nonum, nosmp.
* - I add to disable ACPI to build the non-smp version of x86_64.
