FYI:
Just got 2.3.48 compiled...on boot, unable to mount /dev/hdc1 or /dev/hdd1
which are my second ide controller disks.  Complains about a bad major or
minor number.  All works fine 2.3.47 and earlier.  
This box does not have a pci bus and none is configured, so I'm guessing
a bug in the works maybe.
