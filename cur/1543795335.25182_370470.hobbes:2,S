Hi,
I am facing problems while compiling the Linux kernel(version 2.6.13.2) 
for XTENSA. I am using xtensa-elf- toolchain of following versions -
binutils - 2.12.1
gcc - 3.0.4
The toolchain was built from the sources as per the instruction given 
with the patches that came along with XTENSA configuration
The configuration used for kernel compilation is --- 
arch/xtensa/configs/iss_defconfig.
The compilation seems to go fine except towards the end where I get the 
following error during linking ---
  LD      init/built-in.o
    LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
    arch/xtensa/kernel/built-in.o: In function `__down':
    arch/xtensa/kernel/built-in.o(.sched.text+0x11):dangerous 
relocation: l32r: literal placed after use: .sched.text.literal
    arch/xtensa/kernel/built-in.o(.sched.text+0x23):dangerous

....... many more such messages follow
Would be greatful if somebody could provide information in this regard
