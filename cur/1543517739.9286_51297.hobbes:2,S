Hello,
I have found quite a number of these errors in the /var/log/messages
file of our kNFS v2 servers :
> EXT2-fs warning (device sd(8,17)): ext2_free_blocks: bit already cleared for block 11347573
> EXT2-fs warning (device sd(8,17)): ext2_free_inode: bit already cleared for inode 2836616
Kernel : 2.2.12-20 / knfsd-1.4.7-7 (RH 6.1).
HW : P133 -         48 Mo - Tekram 390F (UW).
     SMP BII 450 - 128 Mo - Tekram 390F (UW).
On each machine, I have also observed things like :
> Nov 23 14:52:00 willy kernel: lookup_by_inode: ino 1976459 not found in LINUX2_2
> Nov 23 14:52:00 willy kernel: find_fh_dentry: 08:11, 2037855/1976459 not found -- need full search! 
Should I worry ?
A+,
