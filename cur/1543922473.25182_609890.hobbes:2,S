There are a number of indicators that need to be kept in sync, depending
on the usage.  The number of entries is set when it is allocated and is
currently needed to free it up (note that in the sgtable "sketch" James
proposed we saved the sg pool index in the sgtable header and used it to
free each chunk to the right pool).  The number of entries is then used in
many places to scan the list, however, after the sg list is dma mapped, the
dma mapping may be shorter than the original sg list when multiple pages are
coalesced and there we need to defer to use the dma_length (plus the number
of entries) to determine the end of the list.
IMO I think that the byte count can be used authoritatively to scan
the contents of the sg list either before or after dma mapping
while the number of entries is relevant to walking the list in a context free
manner (i.e. to go over all the entries that were allocated)
