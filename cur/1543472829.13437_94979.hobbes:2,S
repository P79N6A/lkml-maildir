It's the approach of making free software which also guarantees for its high
quality. Just one important point (out of many others) you missed.

 There is  something  frustrating  about  the quality  and  speed  of  Linux
 development.  I.e. the quality  is too high  and the speed  is too high, in
 other words,  I  can implement  this XXXX feature,  but I bet  someone else
 has already done it and is just about to release his patch to Linus soon...
    [From a posting of Tigran Aivazian to linux-kernel, XXXX = disk stat]
