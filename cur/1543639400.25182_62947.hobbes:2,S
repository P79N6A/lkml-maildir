No no no.
It cannot happen on another CPU, since even if we take a page fault, we 
will all be inside a preempt-safe region (the first thing kmap_atomic() 
does is to increment the preempt count, the last thing the kunmap does is 
to decrement it).
There's nothing that sleeps anywhere, there's nothing that can cause a 
schedule. Exactly because the page fault handler will _see_ that we're in 
a critical region, and will do the "fixup()" thing for us.

I actually suspect that most reads are fairly small, and the page already
exists. But who knows.. pre-loading is certainly easy (a single
instruction).

The thing is, we can _notice_ when the bad case happens (same page), and 
we can for that special case do special logic.
We couldn't do that before, simply because we can't afford to do the page
table walk all the time. But we _can_ afford to do it for the rare cases
that would trap (the deadlock being one of them).
