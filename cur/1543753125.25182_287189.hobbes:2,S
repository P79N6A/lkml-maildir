I'm running Debian Woody - the xfs_check/xfs_repair there didn't seem to
find anything last I tried. I have not re-checked for this last problem

I figured I might need to run the CVS version of xfs tools, and, well,
me being busy and all, I thought I'd just leave the 'delete_me'
directory hanging until some time I got more time on my hands  ;)
