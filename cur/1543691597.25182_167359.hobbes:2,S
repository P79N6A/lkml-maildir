hm, yes, i could disable the ServeRaid module. gotta find out how to 
disable the builtin IDE / Symbios other than recompile the kernel...
can i do this by giving "ide0=noprobe ide1=noprobe ..." on the 
boot-prompt? my rootdisk used to be on hda, will see if i can do something.

the worst thing on this machine is the pre-booting process, where all 
the controllers are "Initializing..."  and "Checking...", and even the 
ServRaid controller wants to have 3 minutes sometimes to settle :-)

even it is "ECC" RAM, i'll give it a try.
Thank your for the quick reply, i'll try these things out, will take 
some time, so maybe i'm back in the evening.
