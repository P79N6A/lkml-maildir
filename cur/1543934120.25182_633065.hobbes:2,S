Trying to compile the v850 port brings you many compile errors, one of 
them exists since at least kernel 2.6.19.
Are there any patches in some external tree that should be merged?
Or will anyone work on getting this port back into a usable state in the 
forseeable future?
Otherwise the only reasonable option would be to remove this port from 
the kernel sources since it is dead code.
