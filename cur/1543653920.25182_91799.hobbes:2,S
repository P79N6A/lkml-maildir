   	From Roman Zippel.  Don't assume that physical memory starts at
   	physical address zero.
   
 Which would be a nice improvement, however:
   -	free_area_init_node(0, &contig_page_data, NULL, zones_size, 0, NULL);
   +	free_area_init_node(0, &contig_page_data, NULL, zones_size,
   +			__pa(PAGE_OFFSET) >> PAGE_SHIFT, NULL);
__pa(PAGE_OFFSET) is not necessarily the first physical address in
the system either.
I've never seen this even implied to be the case :-)
In any event, it isn't well defined and we should make it
so.
