I am not forgetting, but I don't like this idea of 'force' -- it instantly 
raises the question 'force what' and then you're in the quagmire again.
Better to tell the kernel what you want and let the kernel worry about how to 
make it happen.
So the "pdc_ide2=jbod"  would be scanned and interpreted as a request to 
activate ('force') the drive into IDE mode and not enable any ataraid (jbod 
==> just disks),
while "pdc_ide3=promise" would let the drive state be, and make the kernel do 
a "modprobe promise-ft" (or whatever it's called) to load the rest of the 
driver, as is done for 'scsi-hostadapter'. [Would you ever have to force a 
promise chip into promise-raid mode?].
Do you see what I mean?
If you prefer, the string could be "pdc=ide2:ide, ide3:ataraid".

I was using jbod as just that, not as meaning raid-0 or similar. Perhaps I 
should have been clearer. So you've a choice of (just IDE), (RAID via 
ataraid) and (RAID via Promise)

Hint understood and I'll look, but I'm no kernel guru.

pdcraid == ataraid module for PDC?? Haven't looked at the src yet.
