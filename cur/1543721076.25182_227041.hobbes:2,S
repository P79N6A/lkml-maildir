Indeed, this version:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
int main(void)
{
	int fd;
	unsigned char data;
	printf("Disabling WiFi whitelist check.\n");
	fd = open("/dev/nvram", O_RDWR);
	lseek(fd, 0x5c, SEEK_SET);
	read(fd, &data, 1);
	printf("CMOS address 0x5c: %02x->", data);
	data |= 0x80;
	printf("%02x\n", data);
	lseek(fd, 0x5c, SEEK_SET);
	write(fd, &data, 1);
	close(fd);
	printf("Done.\n");
}
worked just fine, and the notebook no longer complains about an
unsupported WiFi card! Now if I only can get the card to enable the
transmitter/receiver. It's a Compaq Atheros card inside an X31 notebook.
