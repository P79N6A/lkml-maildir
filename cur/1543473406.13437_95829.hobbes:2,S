Well, yes it is needed.............find me a pci-config space that gives
you the direct reported ioport addresses and it will report ::
printk("%s: 100%% native mode on irq %d\n", d->name, pciirq);
Until that time it is needed, otherwise making grand assumptions will get
you improperly IRQ probes and crashes.  It is that simple, newer
mainboards do have the option of re-assigning the default interrupt if
standard is used by something else.
Does this explain it ?? :-]
