I'm more familiar with the serial consoles and how PDC interacts with them.
From HP, both Alex Williamson and Bjorn Helgaas know more about
VGA support. I've cc'd both.

parisc serial consoles don't need interrupts enabled. The serial device
does need it's MMIO and/or IO Port range enabled (I forgot which).
ISTR most serial consoles don't do DMA and thus don't need BusMaster
enabled in the PCI command register either.
