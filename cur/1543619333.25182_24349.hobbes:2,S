All,
Sistina is pleased to announce that the LVM2 software is ready for
beta testing.
This is a complete reimplementation of the existing LVM system, both
driver and userland tools.
We encourage you to give it a try and feed back your test results,
bug-fixes, enhancement requests etc. through the normal lists
linux-lvm@sistina.com and lvm-devel@sistina.com.
The new kernel driver (known as "device-mapper") supports volume
management in general and is no longer Linux LVM specific.
As such it is a separate package from LVM2 which you will need
to download and install before building LVM2.
 
ftp://ftp.sistina.com/pub/LVM2/device-mapper/device-mapper-beta1.tgz
The userland tools are available from here:
 
ftp://ftp.sistina.com/pub/LVM2/tools/LVM2.0-beta1.tgz
This release does not support snapshots or pvmove.  These features
will go into a subsequent beta release, hopefully within the next
fortnight.
This is Beta software which is *not* meant to be running on your
production systems.  If necessary, keep backups of your data and LVM
metadata (/etc/lvmconf/*).
We look forward to your feedback.
The Sistina LVM team:
      Patrick Caulfield,
      Alasdair Kergon,
      Heinz Mauelshagen,
      Joe Thornber
