Interesting theory, but no go here.
I just remembered one other thing that may have an impact. I have a
IBM-DTLA-307045 (~45 GB i think) hanging off the same channel as slave.
The thing with that one is that if I try to do a lot of i/o on the
disk..my machine locks up. Hard. alt-sysReq doesn't even work.
I'll try disconnecting that drive when I get a chance but I welcome any
feedback/theories before I get home to do this.
