Thanks for your explanation. Not that I was able to understand, nfs is a
black magic to me :)
But. nfs4_renew_state() checks list_empty(&clp->cl_superblocks) under
clp->cl_sem? So, if it is possible that clp->cl_renewd was scheduled
at the time when nfs4_kill_renewd(), we can deadlock, no? Because
nfs4_renew_state() needs clp->cl_sem to complete, but nfs4_kill_renewd()
holds this sem, and waits for nfs4_renew_state() completion.

Yes, thanks. I missed "goto out" in nfs4_renew_state().
