1. Newer kernels do not boot on 386
2. I use linux successfully since 1997. A year ago I've tried to use
linux on an AMD 5x86, and I realized that newer kernels (>2.4.13) do not
boot. It starts: "loading linux........" and then after a while it
reboots the computer, before "Ok, booting the kernel". I found the same
problem on a Cyrix 486SLC2 too. I tried compile kernels by myself, but
they did the same too, except for 2.4.13. The official Debian
kernel-images failed too. I use lilo-2.2, with debian 3.0 stable
(woody).
3. Kernel 
4. Kernel version: >  2.4.13
5. No Oops..
6.  No shell script
7. AMD 5x86, Cyrix 486SLC2 -  4MB RAM 800MB ide hd, 200MB swap, no PCI,
no SCSI, 2 isa eexpress network adapters, 1 serial, 1 parallel ports,
lilo-2.2. boot loader, debian 3.0 stable woody linux
 
thanks for helping, regards
