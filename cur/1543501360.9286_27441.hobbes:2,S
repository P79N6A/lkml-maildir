Hi,
I've started looking at what damage a user can cause with ioctl() - a
disgusting sprawling kernel interface if ever I saw one :-)
My first "find" is FIBMAP, an ioctl available on regular files. FIBMAP
will happily pass out of range blocks to lower level filesystems. In the
case of ext2, a user can easily get the kernel to emit copious
ext2_warning messages. Hardly an ideal situation. As a rule kernel printk
warnings should be used for ASSERT events not "any user can cause at will"
events.
I didn't audit how other filesystems behave when passed random block
indexes but I guarantee some of them won't be happy.
In fact, the program below, operating on a 0 length file, rendered my
machine useless as a non-root user. Note however that this is kernel
2.2.5, so the actual crash could well have been due to the sheer volume of
printk()'s triggering a race in printk() and/or the console driver. Takes
30s or so to get going :-)
Is FIBMAP used by anything? It would seem to me to be offering users
read access to internal filesystem structures - and as such should be
restricted to root (CAP_SYS_ADMIN or something).
Cheers
Chris
