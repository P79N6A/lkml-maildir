Great news. I pulled your socket branch and am currently trying to
find my way through one of the two hardware drivers available there
and abstract away from the PCI card specific parts.
Is there a design document available? Or will there be some non-PCI
driver soon, perhaps even one for a USB device? That would be
immensely helpful.
Thanks,
Tilman
