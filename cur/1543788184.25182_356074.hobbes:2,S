When I finally got the IRQ threads priorities straight and the softirqd 
priorities
matched to be right underneath the IRQ priorities the system would run
any benchmark I could throw at it with no problems,   modulo the strange
app that wanted to run at priority 99 and depended on itimers or 
sigarlm . . .
For that case I had to match the softirq timer thread to that of the 
app before
it would run with no problems.
