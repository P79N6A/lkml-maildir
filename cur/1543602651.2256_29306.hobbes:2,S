it's enough. The pages you allocate through the Linux page allocator are
private, no additional locking is necessery

so you are using two __get_free_pages(order==9) calls to get two chunks of
2 MB physical areas, and you use them as a single 4 MB area? This is
perfectly legal - but there is no guarantee you will succeed getting two
nearby 2 MB pages. You will get it if your driver initializes during
bootup - but if it's loaded/unloaded via kmod while the system is up and
running and using its RAM, chances are very low that you'll get a single 2
MB page - let alone two that are adjacent.

have you perpahs freed that page? printk every occasion of
allocating/freeing a 2 MB buffer and i'm sure you'll see the problem.
(Perhaps it's the close() implicitly done by exit() that frees the
buffer?)

it appears you freed the page. send the relevant parts of the driver code
for details.
