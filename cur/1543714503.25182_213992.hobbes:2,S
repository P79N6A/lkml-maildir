hi,
I have a general question.
If a process is executing a system call, and an interrupt is invoked,
the process blocks. Now since interrupt handlers cannot block, the time
for which the IH runs is taken out of the process's time-slice ( Is this
right ?).
What if the IH takes up all of the process's time-slice, does the
process gets knocked off the current list and thrown into the expired
list or is there something more to it?
thanks for your time
