"You dirty cracker! A renice +19, that'll teach you!"  :-)
Seriously though, the same is true today, it's just a bit more
cumbersome. Restart the task and you're back to 0. If the sysadmin
wants to stop that, he'll renice your shell. In which case you login
again. And so on.
My point is that this is a problem (annoying user) which has better
solutions (ranging from a polite e-mail to deluser) because renice
won't stop him.
And it's not a *security* concern, as long as the lower values are
still reserved.
I would say the benefit is very small (I mean: who has ever relied on
it?) compared to the difficulties created for users.
