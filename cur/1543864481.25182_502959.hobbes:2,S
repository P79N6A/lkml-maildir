Not quite, the rationale for it being dropped was here:
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/485831
However, it has since been reposted:
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/485833
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/485834
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/485835
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/485837
