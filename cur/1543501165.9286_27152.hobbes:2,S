You are right that the storage layer and the semantic layers should be
separate as layers.  Our current storage layer had to be built first,
because no storage layer would support the semantics I wanted.  Now we
have a storage layer, and I can start work on the semantics.  The need
for new semantics was always what drove reiserfs.
