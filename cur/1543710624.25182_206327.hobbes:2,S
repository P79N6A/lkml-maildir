I installed the recommended kernel GCC as per the docs:
[root@Linux233 linux-2.6.1]# gcc -v
Reading specs from /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/i586-pc-linux-
gnu/2.95.3/specs
gcc version 2.95.3 20010315 (release)
OK, after some research it is a GCC problem - but I need to ask why 
this is now become a problem.
Googling, Andrew Morton pulled this up in the lkml found here:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/7/7/225
Now, I am a bit worried if the lower case version `z' is to be used, 
that it will be a bit of a problem if there are lots of files using 
it.
Also, although GCC reports this as a warning, it also seems to say "I 
don't know what this is, so am ignoring it" sort of thing?
Or am I PARANOIA...
Thanks,
Nick
