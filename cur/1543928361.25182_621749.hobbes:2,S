Hello All,
I am a linux application programmer and kernel newbie.
I would like to use splice() / tee() to do some packet forwarding.
I think these two systems calls are there in 2.6.18 kernel.
My company is deciding to use either 2.6.21 or 2.6.22 kernel in our product.
My question is : Is splice() stable in 2.6.21 / 2.6.22 ?
I found this link where it says
 
http://lwn.net/Articles/251707/
 (search splice)
Jens Axboe (2):
 splice: fix direct splice error handling
 Fix race with shared tag queue maps
Looks like there were some issues with splice that has been fixed in
2.6.22.9 kernel.
I am not sure how critical is that problem . Can I still use the
2.6.21/2.6.22 kernel for splice without any major issues ?
If not, which kernel version would give me a stable splice() .
Please note that I am not subscribed to this list , so please CC me (a
reply-all would do) in your reply.
Thanks in advance.
