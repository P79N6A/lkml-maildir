I'm afraid I don't quite understand what you'd like us to do. Should we
resubmit the whole driver as a single patch? If so, how do we get it
past the lkml size limit, and how do we indicate that this replaces,
instead of going on top of, our 11 Feb 2006 submission in the -mm tree?
Alternatively, would it suffice to make sure that part 1 goes into the
tree after all the others? If so, how would we achieve that?
Also, I'm a bit unsure how this comment relates to the one by Andrew
Morton dated 12 Feb 2006 02:29:21 -0800 in which he writes:

That seems to indicate that the problem is already being taken care of,
and if so, I'd certainly not want to interfere with that.
As to your other comments, they are well taken, and we are preparing a
patch against 2.6.16-rc3-mm1 which we'll submit as soon as the present
issue is sorted out.

Tilman
