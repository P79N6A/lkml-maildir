Negative.  Things have been queued.  The deadlock will only go away if the
very next message processed is the named local message.  And then it would
have to process a few more local messages so it wouldn't stall again so soon.

Please do.  That will reduce the ammount of traffic to the name server.

It's in the syslogd and syslog.conf man page (sysklogd-1.3.31-16):
(syslog.conf)
   Regular File
       Typically  messages are logged to real files. The file has
       to be specified with full pathname, beginning with a slash
       ``/''.
       You  may  prefix  each  entry with the minus ``-'' sign to
       omit syncing the file after every logging. Note  that  you
       might  lose information if the system crashes right behind
       a write attempt. Nevertheless this  might  give  you  back
       some  performance, especially if you run programs that use
       logging in a very verbose manner.

PS: as a side note, you can/will lose information even if sync is enabled.
    (fsync() will not flush metadata so the file is truncated on restart.)
