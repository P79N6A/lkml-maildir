Intel's p3/4 prefetch instructions are hints only. They are only executed
asynchronously, and depend heavily on the other load on the processor at
the time. They are not required to prefetch, *and* they are not required
to be executed when you think they should in the flow of the program. You
can serialize them by using an MFENCE instruction, but they still aren't
guaranteed to run.
Check the p4 manuals. In fact, I'm not sure prefetch was implemented in
p3. I could be wrong, check the manual.
