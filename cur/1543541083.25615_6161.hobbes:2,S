It isn't correct, but after looking a bit at what the kernel does, I
suspect it's not a bug in XFree86 either.
The fact is, that we should only set the palette after we've switched to a
new console, and only if that console is in text mode. That part of the
code is right. Your patch messes that logic up, and sets the palette even
in graphics mode and before doing the switch).
However, that also misses a corner case: let's say that we switch modes
(not VC's) on an existing console that _used_ to be in graphics mode (so
we didn't set the palette when we switched to it) into text mode. We
should now set the palette on that graphics->textmode switch because it
was inhibited before by the graphics mode.
Which this patch does. 
Does this patch work for you?
