Tasklets are startet by a softirq, so there is no current process (there 
is, but is random.) I'm not sure that softirq's alwarys run in 
interrupttime.
Do thins of tasklets like BH's that are much more fair to others (not 
blocking all other processes.)
To add a new sorftirq, yes you need to patch kernel source and therfore 
not reccomended (I believe that there are max. 16 softirq's, so its a 
sparse resource.)
