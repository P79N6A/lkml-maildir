Hmm.  Odd. 
When skimming through the code I thought that reboot_thru_bios was the
default. 
So the code is currently trying a reset through the keyboard controller
and a triple fault and neither work.
If you can't track this down we can at least dig up your board DMI ID
and put it in the list of systems that need to go through the BIOS to reboot.
