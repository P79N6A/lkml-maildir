This has partially been addressed by Takashi's patch for fs-blocksize
i_blocks, and there was also a patch to use either i_frag|i_fsize or
i_faddr as the high bits of this value.  If we think that 2^48 * blocksize
is enough for a file (2^60 bytes for 4kB blocks, 2^64 bytes for 64kB blocks)
then it would be prudent to use (i_frag|i_fsize) as i_blocks_high.  AFAIK,
those fields have never, ever been used, and adding such a change along
with Takashi's patch makes a lot of sense.

This needs another 32 bits for sure.  We might concievably also fix up the
EA code to improve the external-block EA format (e.g. allow pointing at an
extent index block or another inode to allow storing larger EAs).

This is i_size_high for regular files, and I propose that it also become
i_size_high for directories as well, because CFS at least is hitting
limits of 2GB directories already (that's around 25M files).  It also
doesn't take into account that we need to increase the dirent size to
accomodate larger inode numbers and possibly some other attribute data,
which I propose we flag with the high 5 bits of the d_type field.

CFS has a patch that has been working for ages that changes the i_links_count
handling to be the same as reiserfs - namely, if we overflow 65000 links
the directory i_nlinks becomes 1 (disables "find" heuristic to only recurse
into i_nlinks subdirectories), and ext3_dir_empty() is trusted to tell us
when the directory is empty (which it does already, i_nlinks only used
to print out a warning in any case).  Even an unpatched e2fsck and kernel
handle this gracefully.

At the same time, if we reserve too much space, it hurts EAs fitting
into the large inode space (which is at least CFS's and Samba's primary
requirement for large inodes).

I'd rather return success and truncate the timestamp.

In the end, I don't think we can ever have "enough" space reserved for
all needs, so the code will have to have a graceful fallback strategy
in any case.

Like Ted said, and I had said when the large inode patch was first proposed,
if there is something added in the large inode space that is absolutely
mandatory, then it can be covered by an appropriate *COMPAT flag.  I don't
think that the inode timestamps even warrant that protection.

The concept of "reserving" space in i_extra_isize wasn't considered.  Instead
the design was that i_extra_isize would be large enough to cover the valid
fields, and if more space is needed, i_extra_isize would be grown to cover
this space, as applicable.
As Ted says, we could just initialize unused fields to zero and depend on
that.  It works for the timestamps and e.g. checksum at least, and new
code can be made to live with this also.

I thought of this also, though plain "reservation" fails in two regards:
- if the older kernel doesn't understand "s_extra_isize_min", it may still
  consume that space if the filesystem is mounted there
- if all fields in i_extra_isize are not used (e.g. i_checksum is disabled,
  but a later i_dac is enabled), we still need a way to know if the field
  is in use
