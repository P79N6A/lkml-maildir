great. Daniel, would you mind to merge your patchkit against the
following base:
	-mm3, minus lockmeter, plus the -T3 patch
? To make this easier i've uploaded a combined undo-lockmeter patch to:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/undo-lockmeter-2.6.9-rc3-mm3-A1
which you should apply to vanilla -mm3, then apply the -T3 patch:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.9-rc3-mm3-T3
this will apply cleanly with some minor fuzz. The resulting kernel
builds & boots fine with my .config.
