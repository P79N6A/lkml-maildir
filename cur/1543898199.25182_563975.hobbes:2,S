Jörg - I see no attack. What I do see is a quite friendly notification that 
your mail program appears to be omitting those headers in certain mails and 
that such action is in violation of a published standard.
Your response was inflammatory, rude and very trollish. And when the person 
calmly restated himself and the reason he made the original comment you again 
responded in an extremely unpleasant manner.
When notified that your behavior was incorrect you pointed fingers and 
yelled "He started it!" - something that *CHILDREN* do.
Since it appears that you act like a child its time to add you to my killfile 
again.
