I know several people using them, and for some ioctl operations they are
required. In fact without taskfile ioctl stuff I can't make my laptop resume
correctly for example. (it needs proper drive please wake up sequences to
go the ibm microdrive)
At this point I think you've overstepped the mark. The taskfile stuff is
rather important. If you don't understand why please read the ATA6 standard
and look at the sequence of phases. Think of it as a scsi sequencer in 
kernel space because the hardware isnt bright enough to do it.
