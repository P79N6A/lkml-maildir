Not just crazy, but wrong - this *can* happen on pre-Montecito.  Even though
L1D is write-through and L2 was mixed I/D, the L1 I-cache could contain
stale instrutions if there are missing flushes. I think the only reason this
has never been observed is that the L1I is so small (32K) that it's likely
that any stale data has been displaced.
