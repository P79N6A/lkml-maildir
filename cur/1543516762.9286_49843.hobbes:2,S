I can generally go from make oldconfig to having the reboot up in well under
10 minutes.  That's on a 550.  I've never actually timed it, but it's fast
enough I don't avoid a recompile/relink/reboot sequence.

Would a 500 MHz K7 do? I'm expecting delivery of one shortly. I can't
compare with Celeron myself, because I don't have one, but I can post
the kernel .config I use.
