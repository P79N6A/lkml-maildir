Andrew has already sent a revert patch to Linus and it's in -rc6. The 
commit is below.

    [PATCH] remove protection of LANANA-reserved majors
    
    Revert all this.  It can cause device-mapper to receive a different major from
    earlier kernels and it turns out that the Amanda backup program (via GNU tar,
    apparently) checks major numbers on files when performing incremental backups.
    
    Which is a bit broken of Amanda (or tar), but this feature isn't important
    enough to justify the churn.
