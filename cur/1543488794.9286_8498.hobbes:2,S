I found a bad problem today. I launched a cdparanoia rip  of a
cd while i was online on a ppp link. ppp hung and it began to report frame errors
then i stopped the cdparanoia session and everything came back to normal :
I t seems that when i access the ide bus heavily, ppp suffers a lot and starts giving errors.
I tried to set umaskirq on all drives, but that did not help.
my configuration is a P200mmx, with ide drives, HX chipset,
(DMA is enabled by default ) , kernel 2.2.2ac7.
has anyone a clue about the whole thing ?
(i did not try vanilla 2.2.2)
On the 2.0.x kernels i used a program called irqtune,
but it doesnt work anymore on 2.2.
ciao
enrico
