Thanks for this Christoph!
These patches are great: the early experiments are obviously over, and so this 
consolidation is overdue.
Have you considered moving x86-64's setup_per_cpu_areas into generic code?  
It's a bit messier because some archs might not have set up NUMA stuff yet, 
but it's logically generic...
Thanks!
Rusty.
