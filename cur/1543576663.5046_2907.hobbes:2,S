    testing was that I was testing the new VM stuff under heavy VM
    load - to shake out any bugs.
Does this mean anyone using test13-pre4 should also expect to see
data not being flushed on shutdown? 
I'm not seeing data loss (or it's not obvious if I am) but wonder if
I should make a application to run before halt to allocate and walk
all available memory as an interim?
