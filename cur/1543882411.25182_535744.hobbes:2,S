Right, and there are also RAID devices that really want a 2 MiB I/O
size.  Even if we could use 512 s/g entries (which would take two
pages), the other big problem is that many I/O chips/cards are limited
in the amount of space they have for s/g lists.  So, you'd face the
possibility that you could do a 2MiB I/O request with 512 s/g entries,
but then you couldn't start a second request on that host until the
first one finished.
