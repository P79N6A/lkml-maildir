Its a performance fix but also a correctness issue with multiple pid
namespaces. Here is the modified patch with the simplified changelog and
comment removed.

Not sure I fully understand this. A process, and by extension its 'struct
pid' is visible in multiple namespaces and we maintain this list of
namespaces in each 'struct pid'.
Are you suggesting having a pid_namespace with a list of all 'struct pids'
that are visible in it ?

| Sukadev, could you cc me if you do that kind of changes?
Sure - I will.

From: Sukadev Bhattiprolu <sukadev@us.ibm.com>
Use task_pid() to get leader's 'struct pid' and avoid the find_pid().
