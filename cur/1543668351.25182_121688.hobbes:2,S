I've put the updated HDLC patch (against 2.4.21pre6) in:
ftp://ftp.pm.waw.pl/pub/linux/hdlc/current/hdlc-2.4.21pre6.patch.gz
against 2.4.21-pre5-ac3:
ftp://ftp.pm.waw.pl/pub/linux/hdlc/current/hdlc-2.4.21pre5-ac3.patch.gz
against 2.5.66 (this is, of course, a little different):
ftp://ftp.pm.waw.pl/pub/linux/hdlc/current/hdlc-2.5.66.patch.gz
Tested on all hardware I've access to (C101 and N2) on 2.4 and 2.5 kernels.
No much changes from previous release (the one in Alan's 2.4 tree): my (low
level) drivers have now smaller TX packet rings to decrease TX latency for
high priority packets (LMI etc), and there is only one RAM-sizing routine
for both cards (as well as for drivers not included in the official tree).
The code has been cleaned a bit.
kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL) in interrupt context has been fixed.
Some __init etc fixes.
No ABI/API changes.
Marcelo, please apply to 2.4.21-pre6,
Alan, please apply to 2.4.21-pre5-ac3,
Linus, please apply to 2.5.66.
Thanks.
