Hi,
(Sorry for the previous empty mail, I was a bit too fast with sending and
couldn't stop it completly.)

Disclaimer: I know that the following doesn't match the current
implementation, it's just how I would intuitively would do it:
- get dentry foo
- get dentry baz
- lock inode foo
- mark dentry foo as deleted
- getblk file header foo
- mark file header foo as deleted
- getblk file header baz
- update file header baz from file header foo
- brelse file header baz
- update inode foo
- unlock inode foo
- put dentry baz
- lock foo's parent
- getblk and update dir header parent
- getblk file headers from foo's chain until file header of predecessor of
  foo found
- update predecessor to point to successor of foo
- brelse everything
- unlock foo's parent
- put and invalidate dentry foo
- last user of foo frees file header foo in bitmap
I probably forgot something, but you will surely tell me. Two things I
want to mention anyway. First, I only lock something when needed, that of
course breaks with current conventions. Second (and most important), I use
the dentry to block a possible lookup of an inode, so noone can open or
create foo or do anything else with it. A rename would work similiar only
that the new dentry would be marked as not complete yet.

Please post it, I know there are some interesting examples, but I don't
have them at hand. Although I wanted to keep that flamewar for later, but
if we're already in it...

To be fair it shoud be mentioned, that links were added later to affs.
