sound support is hard... The folks at 4-front have the benefit of a
liscense from the vendor for their intelectual property property used in
the driver... That has two implications, The code is proprietary, and the
vendor must be paid... I don't imagine they're getting rich in the
business but if you have a card that has a chipset that is supported well
by them and poorly by the various other sound initiatives, you have to
decide wether it's worth it or not.
In any case your card is fairly well supported by the alsa-project... so
I'd recomend trying the alsa drivers
