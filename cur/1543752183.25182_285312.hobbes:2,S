I understand your concern and appreciate it.
I dont expect anyone to be using v2.4 mainline on S390 (you need external 
patches to get it to work anyway) either :)
But the stack growth patches are also useful for other architectures I assume, 
its pretty hard to get them wrong (ie you're simple changing stack to 
kmalloc()'ed memory, the code is essentially the same). 
No?
