remember, this is being done inside the kernel. the kernel can do things like 
saving off the scheduler queue to prevent any userspace from running during the 
snapshot, it could then move selected pids over to a new queue to selectivly 
'unfreeze' whatever you need (like the X processes for example) and then proceed 
normally (allowing processes to be spawned, forked, etc without activiating the 
rest of userspace becouse the rest just won't be available to be scheduled) and 
userspace can tell the kernel the list of pids to unfreeze so the kernel doesn't 
need to try and guess.
