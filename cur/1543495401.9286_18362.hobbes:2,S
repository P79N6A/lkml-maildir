Really I would like to consider it as the not common case.
It completly depends on what you are doing. If you are doing a fast
two-task ping-pong over a pipe the common case is _not_ "prev runnable".
But I'd like to consider the "prev running" case as the "common" case
because I like to optimze the scheduler for high CPU loads. But this again
is not an issue for the reschedule_idle in schedule_tail thing, that make
sense anyway.
Here I am talking about the goto still_running you put in the scheduler
proper. And it's obviously only a minor issue ;).
