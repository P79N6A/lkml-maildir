No no - not disable exclusive cpusets - disable using them to try
to define sched domains.
That is, I hope you mean that Dinakar's patch that uses cpu_exclusive
cpusets to define sched domains should be disabled for 2.6.13.  For
what they were worth (not a whole lot, granted), cpu_exclusive cpusets
have been in the kernel since 2.6.12.  They just didn't have any affect
in the placement of sched domains.  So long as they continue to do not
a whole lot, I see more risk than gain in disabling them for 2.6.13.
So long as the cpuset code stops making any calls to partition_sched_domains()
whatsoever, then we should be back where we were in 2.6.12, so far as the
scheduler is concerned - right?
I hope that the following (untested, unbuilt) patch, that I suggested
in my "Mon, 22 Aug 2005 13:38:23 -0700" message best meets you
suggestion above ... and I quote:
==========
The safest, mind numbingly simple thing to do that would avoid the oops
that Hawkes reported is to simply not have the cpuset code call the
code to setup a dynamic sched domain.  This is choice (2) above, and
could be done at the last hour with relative safety.
Here is an untested patch that does (2):
