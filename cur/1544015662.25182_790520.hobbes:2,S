Right, so I totally lost this thread in my inbox -- sorry for that.

Not quite so, you can avoid starvation with deadline schedulers, just
limit their budget.

Well, that's not my problem is it ;-), just batter them with a
clue-stick, no need to fudge the kernel for that.

Right, which is where deadline scheduling would be nice. Once you start
running into the budget throttle you know you've got to start dropping
frames in order to keep up.
The proposal is for it to start sending SIGXCPU once it starts
throttling tasks in order to notify them of missed deadlines etc.

Like said, deadline schedulers can help here. You can even dynamically
adjust the parameters -- eg. fall back to half frame rate but double
budget or something.
