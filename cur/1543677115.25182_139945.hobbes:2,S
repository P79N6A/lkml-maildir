Because we no longer hold the dcache_lock while doing a d_lookup().
With the dentry still around (RCU wouldn't happen until all CPUs
do a context switch or execute user-level code), lookup can continue
to traverse the hash list while another CPU deletes the currrent
dentry. Once RCU happens, it is guranteed that no other CPU
could be in that dentry during hash list traversal. That is why
we have _rcu versions of the list deletion macros.
Lockfree d_lookup() gives us significant benefits in larger
SMP machines.
Does my patch meet the requirements that you had for __d_drop() ?
Thanks
