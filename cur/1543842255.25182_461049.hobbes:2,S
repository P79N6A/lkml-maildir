Yep.  That would do it.  And of course having written the
code it was very hard for me to step back far enough to see that.
The other two failure modes still don't make sense to me but
they may have been a side effect of this.
And it would have taken a thread being the highest pid in the
system that exits while we are calling filldir to trigger this.
Wow.  That was a good stress test.
