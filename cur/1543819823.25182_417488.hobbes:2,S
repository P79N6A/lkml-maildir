Paul,
Please apply and forward upstream.  And a question: once 
upon a time, the arch PCI subsystem was inited after mem init 
was done; currently, it seems to be happening before mem init. 
Is this intentional?

[PATCH] powerpc/pseries: avoid crash in PCI code if mem system not up.
The powerpc code is currently performing PCI setup before
memory initialization. PCI setup touches PCI config space
registers. If the PCI card is bad, this will evoke an error,
which currrently can't be handled, as the PCI error recovery 
code expects kmalloc() to be functional.  This patch will
cause the system to punt instead of crashing with
cpu 0x0: Vector: 300 (Data Access) at [c0000000004434d0]
    pc: c0000000000c06b4: .kmem_cache_alloc+0x8c/0xf4
    lr: c00000000004ad6c: .eeh_send_failure_event+0x48/0xfc
This patch Will also print name of the offending pci device.
