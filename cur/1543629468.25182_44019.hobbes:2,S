  Hi,
I've recently bought an agp graphic card, so I would like to use the
agpgart.o module, but it doesn't seems to work with my mother board:
coruscant:~# modprobe agpgart
Linux agpgart interface v0.99 (c) Jeff Hartmann
agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 203M
/lib/modules/2.5.13/kernel/drivers/char/agp/agpgart.o: init_module: No such device
Hint: insmod errors can be caused by incorrect module parameters, including invalid IO or IRQ parameters
/lib/modules/2.5.13/kernel/drivers/char/agp/agpgart.o: insmod
/lib/modules/2.5.13/kernel/drivers/char/agp/agpgart.o failed
/lib/modules/2.5.13/kernel/drivers/char/agp/agpgart.o: insmod agpgart failed
As you can see, I'm using the 2.5.13 kernel, but I had the same error
with 2.4.17.
My mother board is an MSI K7T266 Pro2.
  Any ideas? Is this a known problem? Is this due to some wrong setting
in my bios?
  I can test any patch, if needed.
          Thanks,
                  DindinX
