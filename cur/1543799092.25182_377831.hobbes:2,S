I'm really looking forward to seeing your patch.
It will e.g. be interesting to measure whether there'll be any 
performance impact.
And since after this patch driver authors might become more sloppy with 
stack usage since there's no longer a hard limit, it will be especially 
interesting to see how you'll implement ensuring that there are no 
additional stack usages > 1 kB between two invocations of you check 
function, because otherwise your patch won't work reliable.
