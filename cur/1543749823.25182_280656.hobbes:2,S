Since the Cobalt systems are single-processor, there's no functional difference 
between disabling global and local interrupts.

True, but it would requre making struct lcd_display a global variable, and involve 
reworking just about the whole driver, since it is declared as a local variable in 
individual ioctl case statements, and others use the variable defined at the top 
of the ioctl function.  OTOH, it would reduce stack usage...
I was trying to minimize any mucking about with the functional parts of the 
driver, since I don't have the hardware to test it.
Since ioctls are still protected by the BKL right now (and this thing is pretty 
much nothing but an ioctl interface), I don't see too much of a problem with this 
driver.  More complete drivers, however, would definitely benefit from it, and is 
something I'll keep in mind.
