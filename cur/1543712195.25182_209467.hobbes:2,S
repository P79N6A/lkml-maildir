Shipped - yes, but how is it modified (ie edited) ?
Using a special program? That's fine then. Using a hex editor? That's
also fine. Using a VHDL compiler ? Then they need to give out the VHDL
code to it I believe. But hell, what do I know, when moving over to
hardware it's uncertain how the GPL would apply, at least to me,
and of course IANAL.
