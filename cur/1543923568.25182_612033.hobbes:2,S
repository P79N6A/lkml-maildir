As about read_urb_finished probably it's OK. But we shouldn't decrease open_count in the case of error as then we return normal exit value.
Here is what we had before:
				 dev->interrupt_in_endpoint->bInterval);
		dev->read_urb_finished = 0;
		retval = usb_submit_urb(dev->interrupt_in_urb, GFP_KERNEL);
		if (retval) {
			dev->read_urb_finished = 1;
			--dev->open_count;
		}
So I can left it but w/o this line:
--dev->open_count;
What is more critical is that I added:
	/* initialize out direction */
	dev->out_urb_finished = 1;
Without this we'll always have write timeouts.
