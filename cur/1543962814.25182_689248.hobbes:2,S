I assume it's one or both of these loops in arch/x86/xen/time.c 
do_stolen_accounting() that are being optimized into a divide which 
generates a libgcc call:
	while (stolen >= NS_PER_TICK) {
		ticks++;
		stolen -= NS_PER_TICK;
	}
or
	while (blocked >= NS_PER_TICK) {
		ticks++;
		blocked -= NS_PER_TICK;
	}
I seem to recall in one previous case we added some dummy assembly code 
to stop gcc from doing this. Not sure if that is a sustainable fix, though..
