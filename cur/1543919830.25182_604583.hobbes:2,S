What protects smk_cipso_written?  BTW, its use on the read side is an
atrocity...
smk_write_doi() - WTF would NUL-terminate temp[]?  You run sscanf on
it...
smk_write_direct() - ditto
smk_write_ambient() - ditto
smk_read_ambient() - who said that you won't get write between strlen()
and simple_read_from_buffer()?
