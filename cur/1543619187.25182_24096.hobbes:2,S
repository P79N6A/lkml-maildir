Then you'd need to somehow ensure that "hot" objects get into pages with
other "hot" objects... an LRU list (as was proposed here), but not just for
cleaning but also for considering as places for new objects? Keep a/this
list (somewhat) sorted by fullness, so that you preferently place new
objects in fullish pages, not in emptyish ones (perhaps slab is doing this
already)?
