This has been the case for a long time already (so long that I can't
remember
if/when it started:), so how did this change recently ? It didn't...
And vendors who supply binary only modules know already that they get to
do 
all the support as rules of the game. That didn't change either.
It's just that it's now easier for the people who get to handle
bugreports
to ask "which modules do you use" as first question if the tainted flag
is set,
instead of spending hours investigating a weird oops. 
Greetings,

   (and yes, I do get a fair share of bugreports and really like to know
which 
    reports I should be suspicious of and ask for module lists etc)
