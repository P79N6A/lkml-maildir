Quoting r. Shirley Ma <xma@us.ibm.com>:
> According to some results from different resouces, NAPI only gives 3%-10% performance improvement on single CQ.
When you say performance you mean bandwidth.
But I think it should improve the CPU utilization on RX side significantly.
If it does, that an important metric as well.
> I am trying a simple NAPI patch on splitting CQ now to see how much performance there.
What are you using for a benchmark?
