Hi List,
I do have some nice problem.
I got a new Omnibook XE3/1066, and wanted to install Linux.
Problems are growing big :)
All information regards to kernel 2.5.0.
One of my Problems is: I cannot read battery-level trough either acpi
nor apm.
On acpi kernel tells me on cat /proc/acpi/battery/1/info:
Present:		yes
Design Capacity:	5400 mAh
Last Full Capacity:	5400 mAh
...
Model Number:		LIP9071
...
Battery Type:		LiON
OEM Info:		HP
so far so good.
cat /proc/acpi/battery/1/status:
Present:		yes
Error reading battery status (_BST)
ouch.
best thing - next cat /proc/acpi/battery/1/info:
Present:		yes
Error reading battery information (_BIF)
double ouch.
Using APM results are more or less the same.
any hints?
thanks
	Lars Duesing
