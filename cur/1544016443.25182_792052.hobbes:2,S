As they are one-liners for the most part I am fine with you handling
them in a eparate branch.
It is far better than I queue them up for at least two weeks before I
can give the kernel a bit of attention again.
Obviously it would be better if the Maintainers took them but history
tells us we cannot rely on that for all areas.
