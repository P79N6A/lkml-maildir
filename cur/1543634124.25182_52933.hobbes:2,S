Hmmm, I've skimmed your patch before, but really only just for the
lowest common features bit. I didn't quite grasp it last time, but I
really like what you're doing there. TSC overflow can be almost
eliminated if we use the full 64bits, but if we can round robin the
interrupts, that would help compensate for any skew in the clocks.
Thanks for the pointer!
