I'm having the same exact problem with a Plextor PX-8432T CD-RW drive that 
another person reported back in March (see copy of message by person 
identified as "c o r e" below):
Vendor: PLEXTOR  Model: CD-R   PX-W8432T Rev: 1.07
Type:   CD-ROM                 ANSI SCSI revision: 02  
This is an IDE CD-RW drive on /dev/hdc, configured as a SCSI using ide-scsi 
emulation.  It shows up on my system as /dev/sr0 and /dev/scd0 (I don't know 
what the difference is between the two device files, they seem to function 
the same).
I cannot mount it! However, somehow (I have no idea how) I did manage to get 
it to mount once but after rebooting it would not mount again.  Even though I 
can't mount it, I can write audio cds with it (and likely data cds too but I 
have not tried that yet).  When the drive is configured as an IDE drive on 
/dev/hdc, I can mount it without any problem as long as I give mount -t 
iso9660.  Without the -t iso9660 it fails to mount.  Its very strange that I 
can write cds and play cd music off the drive, but if I try to mount it, it 
fails just like "c o r e" experienced below.  Is there any fix for this yet? 
I'm using Linux kernel 2.2.16.  Any help greatly appreciated.

I've been having some intermittent problems with a brand new plextor IDE 
CD-RW drive under linux. I haven't had any problems reading or writing to 
the drive under winDOS 95, nor have I had problems writing to the drive 
using cdrecord, but I've had tons of problems reading from the drive (e.g. 
mounting a CD). I'm accessing the drive via ide-scsi emulation. 
I'm running 2.2.14 and have tried the latest IDE patch (ide20000124) to 
see if that would help, but I still have problems. 
Here's what happens when I try to mount a CD: 
[root@manteador ~]$ mount -t iso9660 -o ro /dev/scd0 /mnt/cdrom 
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/scd0, 
       or too many mounted file systems 
[root@manteador ~]$ 
Relevant errors from 'dmesg' caused by the mount attempt: 
scsi0 : SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices 
scsi : 1 host.

Unable to identify CD-ROM format. 
/etc/conf.modules relevant contents: 
# kernel 2.2.x ATAPI SCSI emulation 
options ide-cd ignore=hdc # if /dev/hdc is your CD-writer 
post-install sr_mod /sbin/modprobe ide-scsi # auto probe module 
alias scd0 sr_mod # load sr_mod upon access of scd0 
alias scsi_hostadaptor ide-scsi # SCSI host adaptor emulation 
I need some assistance in determining if this is a hardware problem or a 
linux problem so that I can RMA the drive or linux ;-) 
If I try to mount the CD using straight ATAPI mode it works just fine 
(i.e. /dev/hdc without scsi modules). 
Now oddly that I've re-enabled the ide-scsi modules, I can mount cdroms 
with no problem. This doesn't always work. 
Perhaps I should enable verbose scsi error reporting... I'll wait to hear 
back from you fine folks first. Please CC me on replies since I'm not 
subscribed. Tx!
