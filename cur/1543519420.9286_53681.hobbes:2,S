I can't tell from the credits or maintainers file who is handling the memory
initialization changes in arch/i386/kernel/setup.c, so I'm "asking the
list".
1) Of all of the various max_pfn test/setup code seems to tacitly assume
that memory from 1G on is in one big block.  i.e.
	if (max_low_pfn > MAXMEM_PFN) {
		max_low_pfn = MAXMEM_PFN;
...
But there is no particular reason to believe this is the case.  If we want
our communications to the user to be accurate, in the above case, should we
not re-scan the memory map to find the actual maximum low pfn of available
ram?
BTW, the current scan looks to me particularly ugly.  I think the whole map
should be converted to pfns BEFORE trying to find the max, and that a
boundary map is a much cleaner way to implement things at this point.
Yes, I'm banging out the patch...
