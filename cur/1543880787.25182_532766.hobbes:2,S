yes, that's exactly the main idea behind CFS, and thanks for the 
compliment :)
Under this concept the scheduler never really has to guess: every 
scheduler decision derives straight from the relatively simple 
one-sentence (!) scheduling concept outlined above. Everything that 
tasks 'get' is something they 'earned' before and all the scheduler does 
are micro-decisions based on math with the nanosec-granularity values. 
Both the rbtree and nanosec accounting are a straight consequence of 
this too: they are the tools that allow the implementation of this 
concept in the highest-quality way. It's certainly a very exciting 
experiment to me and the feedback 'from the field' is very promising so 
far.

yes. rq->nr_running is really just a first-level approximation of 
rq->raw_weighted_load. I concentrated on the 'nice 0' case initially.

hm. So far i tried to not do any statistical approach anywhere: the 
p->wait_runtime metric (which drives the task ordering) is in essence an 
absolutely precise 'integral' of the 'expected runtimes' that the task 
observes and hence is a precise "load-average as observed by the task" 
in itself. Every time we base some metric on an average value we 
introduce noise into the system.
i definitely agree with your suggestion that CFS should use a 
nice-scaled metric for 'load' instead of the current rq->nr_running, but 
regarding the basic calculations i'd rather lean towards using 
rq->raw_weighted_load. Hm?
your suggestion concentrates on the following scenario: if a task 
happens to schedule in an 'unlucky' way and happens to hit a busy period 
while there are many idle periods. Unless i misunderstood your 
suggestion, that is the main intention behind it, correct?
