Did you benchmark the code?
I assume that polling > 16300 fds will be slow anyway, I'm not sure that
you'll notice the vmalloc().

No. IMHO we should avoid allocating more that 4 kB contiguous memory
during regular sys-calls. kmalloc()'s for more than 4 kB should only
happen during system initialization.
