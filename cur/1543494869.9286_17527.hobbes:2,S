Alt. Alpha uses HZ at 1024 so you get a scheduling rate by default 10
times higher than in all other archs.

I think what we should do is to reschedule _only_ if a different process
will be scheduled. What I consider oversheduling is to schedule() and then
not switch to another task. Could you apply the patch below and run vmstat
1 again and see the rate of the overscheduling?

If the rate is low there is no overscheduling and you should simply
decrease HZ to spend less time in the scheduler.
