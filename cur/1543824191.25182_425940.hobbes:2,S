I say it is a firefox problem because other apps don't have this delay!
So clearly, firefox is doing something stupid here that other apps
doesn't do.  Waiting 3 seconds isn't that painful.
I haven't tried with a java app - I don't think I have any of those.
Are they special in any way?

It all depends on what latency and bandwith you have.
5-6 Mbps is enough to have a decent experience, except for
some stupid apps.  Firefox is certainly slow in starting, and
somewhat slow later too.  But one doesn't have to run firefox,
there are other browsers.  And usually, the webbrowser is
something you _can_ run locally.  At least if you're simply
trying to read webpages.

60 sessions - sure.  The more users, the more resources you need .  .  .
