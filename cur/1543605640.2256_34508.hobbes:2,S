The crypto stuff is compiled as modules and they were not used nor loaded at
that time.
An init 3 now on my box, disconnected my ssh-session ??? sorry, so I can
only tell you later when I'm at home to check what happened this time....
sorry. (uptime so far was 21 hours, the mysterious thing is that it happened
almost the same minute ~15:02:00 same as yesterday, I have to check that.)

But can you tell me what is this memory area coming from ? c000000 should be
free ?
RAM goes here:
00000000-0009fbff : System RAM
0009fc00-0009ffff : reserved
000a0000-000bffff : Video RAM area
000c0000-000c7fff : Video ROM
000f0000-000fffff : System ROM
00100000-0ffeffff : System RAM
Framebuffer here:
d0000000-d7ffffff : PCI Bus #01
other PCI stuff follows...
thx,
Andy.
