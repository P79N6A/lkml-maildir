Hello all,
again, news on this topic. Today I plugged in an additional:
01:03.0 Unknown mass storage controller: Promise Technology, Inc. 20268 (rev
01)
and connected my ATAPI cdwriter to it. And _now_ everything works! ide-scsi is
just fine, I can mount CDs again. So I state that the ide-driver for 
00:0f.1 IDE interface: ServerWorks CSB5 IDE Controller (rev 93)
is in fact broken, at least regarding use of ide-scsi. If anyone has patches or
the like, please submit, I can test.
I tested all available -ac and they all do not work. 2.4.20 does not work
either.
