No, but all the people I've taught to drive have suddenly "got it" after
a gentle introduction as to how the clutch clutch and engine speed work
together in the transmission to accellerate/decellerate the car...

not the "push that pedal towards the floor and pop the other one out!".
But... everyone learns differently...
