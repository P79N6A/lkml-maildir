I don't recall any request queueing problems, it's pretty straight
forward to lock the queue down and prevent any new requests from
entering. sysfs problems is the only issue, and before Al does his magic
on that stuff, the patch just doesn't make sense. So it hasn't been
posted publically. With the sysfs disabled, I can switch io schedulers
on the fly quite easily.

Depends. If the sysfs stuff doesn't get fixed, then no it wont happen.
