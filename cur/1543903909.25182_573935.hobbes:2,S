For what it's worth; put me down as supporting the merger of swap
prefetch. I've found it useful in the past, Con has maintained it
nicely and cleaned up everything that people have pointed out - it's
mature, does no harm - let's just get it merged.  It's too late for
2.6.23-rc1 now, but let's try and get this in by -rc2 - it's long
overdue...
