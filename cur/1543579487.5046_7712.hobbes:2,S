I am curious about another style issue.  In particular _inline_ in ".h" 
files.  The "style" for this as practiced today is about to run into a 
brick wall.  Try, for example, referring to "current->need_resched" 
within the spin_lock() macro.  I don't think you can get this to work 
with the current kernel, and if you can, a) let me know how, and b) it 
is much too hard.  Imho it is time to rethink how (or where) we put 
_inline_ code.
I think the problem could be fixed by a convention in the compiler that 
says something like "_inline_" code will be compiled when a reference to 
it is encountered, but this is outside the standard (i.e. the standard 
allows it to be as it is and does not disallow my proposed convention, 
as I understand the standard).
