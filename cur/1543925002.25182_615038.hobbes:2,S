Yes, and this was the old behaviour. The mentioned patch changed it -
("do mce_create_device in CPU_UP_PREPARE instead of CPU_ONLINE").
Thinking twice about the problem it seems obvious that this part
of the patch should just be reverted.
Attached is a new fix (diff against 2.6.24-rc2).

Andreas

[PATCH] x86: fix cpu hotplug regression (don't call mce_create_device on CPU_UP_PREPARE)
Fix regression introduced with d435d862baca3e25e5eec236762a43251b1e7ffc
("cpu hotplug: mce: fix cpu hotplug error handling").
For CPUs not brought up during boot (using maxcpus and additional_cpus
parameters) we don't know whether mce is supported or not at "CPU_UP_PREPARE"-time.
Thus mce_cpu_callback should be called after the CPU is online.
