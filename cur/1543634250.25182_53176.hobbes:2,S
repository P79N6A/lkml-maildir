<shrug> for ext2 a limited form of "shrinking" is easy to implement.
ext2_delete_entry() can easily notice that it's about to create an
empty entry spanning entire last block.  In that case it should
just walk back and check beginnings of previous blocks, as long
as they are empty (inode = 0, len = block size).  Then it's vmtruncate()
time - all IO on directories is protected by i_sem, so we are safe.
IOW, making sure that empty blocks in the end of directory get freed
is a matter of 10-20 lines.  If you want such patch - just tell, it's
half an hour of work...
