They're impossible to capture because they're only visible
on the VGA screen for like 0.2 seconds before the machine
reboots and the screen is blanked; they don't show up on
the serial console.
They look like paths to the vmlinuz and initrd surrounded
by [ ] brackets, so I guess they come from grub.
