Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here are some USB fixes and new device ids against 2.6.21-rc4.
These patches contain a fix for a regression that is on Adrian's list
with regards to usb-serial drivers oopsing, and they also add a number
of different device ids and other minor updates.
All of these have been in the -mm releases.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/usb-2.6.git/
The full patches will be sent to the linux-usb-devel mailing list, if
anyone wants to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
