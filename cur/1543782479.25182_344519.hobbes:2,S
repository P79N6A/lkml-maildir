This time I think I agree with you.  ;-)
Let's just pass zero for the "above" parameter in idr_get_new_above(),
which is I believe the behavior of the other interface, and see if the
1024-multiple problem goes away.  We definitely did not have that
before.
If it does, and we don't have another solution, let's run with that for
2.6.13.  I don't want this bug released.
