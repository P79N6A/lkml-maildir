You perhaps mean WAN dependency, don't you? I was under impression
that the "menu" patches have already been merged so the WAN
dependency would be automatic.
Anything other than that? Sure, I can see now. I can only say,
in my defense, that I was (and still am) very tired. I'm going to
get some coffee.
There is still a very good reason for the select.
CONFIG_HDLC _is_ a simple library, though probably not the most
simple one. I really feel it's an improvement.
Attaching two patches, hopefully the double check is enough.
