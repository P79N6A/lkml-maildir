Well i was more curious as to where in the patchset the 
switch_ipi_to_APIC_timer is used;
zwane@montezuma linux-2.6-hg-x86_64 {0:1} grep switch_ipi_to_APIC_timer /tmp/patch[1234]
/tmp/patch2:+void switch_ipi_to_APIC_timer(void *cpumask);
/tmp/patch2:+void switch_ipi_to_APIC_timer(void *cpumask)
/tmp/patch2:+EXPORT_SYMBOL(switch_ipi_to_APIC_timer);
/tmp/patch4:+void switch_ipi_to_APIC_timer(void *cpumask)
/tmp/patch4:+EXPORT_SYMBOL(switch_ipi_to_APIC_timer);
/tmp/patch4:+void switch_ipi_to_APIC_timer(void *cpumask);
Or will it only be used in future?
