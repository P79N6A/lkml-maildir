Problem:
Total lockup, not even sysrq worked, when trying 
to mount cdroms. Sometimes kernel message "lost interrupt".
I started to switch all the defs/undefs in ide-cd.c
(SLOW_IO ...)
I finally got my broken cdroms to work with 2.2.9
disabling dma for the drives using hdparm. Now:
1. 
Kernel config help says about "enabling dma by default"
only sth about a controller i dont own. Perhaps
the documentation should be extended to "this controller
and any flakey hardware"?
2.
What reasons exist for a "lost interrupt"? How about
inserting a list about this into Documentation/ide.txt,
perhaps:
problem: lost interrupt
possible solutions: disable dma
