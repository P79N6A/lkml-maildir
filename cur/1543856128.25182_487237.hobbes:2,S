Ok, I understand that. I was not expecting more
resolution. I expected only that I would get more
precise 10ms delays. What confuses me is that the
delays roughly doubled.

It is good to know that the problem is not the arm
architecture itself. Thanks to you for that.
The problem must be in the lh7a40x specific code or my
configuration. I am not yet convinced enough that high
resolution timer implementation would solve the
problem. I don't need timing resolution finer than
10ms providing that FB doesn't blow it up to 60ms.
Could you or someone please give a hint where to look
next or give an explanation why the lack of high
resolution timer would behave like that.
