I just did that, and it really improved the response :-)
But as you said below, it eventually loses the interrupt call and stays
sleeping until "^C" (using an cat /dev/chaos).

Yes, I guess that I will need something like the queue.
I was thinking of something like:
while (queue == 0){ schedue(); }
And wait for the interrupt to change "queue".  But, isn't it a BAD
implemantation?
But if keep using cli()  I will miss an interrupt eventually, right?
how do I avoid that (using cli)?
