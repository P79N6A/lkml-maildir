Same here, but then with Mauelschagens LVM. An mkfs -t ext2 for the
first time (after bootup) on a striped LV will trigger the "Got LVM
request, not good" message (and accompanied by some "trying to ...
beyond end of device" messages). The second attempt will not generate
these messages.
I'm sorry, but I still have the strong belief that this isn't hardware
nor RAID (only) related. There must be some bug lurking, we have to
stamp out before we can take 2.4 seriously.

Ok. Does SMP be the common denominator in your test? Almost all reports
are with SMP machines.
