...Hmmm... On the other hand, despite misleading dependency chain on
this report, lockdep seems to be right: dev->queue_lock and
dev->ingress_lock are really taken in a different order from
qdisc_lock_tree() and while using act_mirred! Now I wonder why this
warning is so rare?
So, let's give a break to lockdep maintainers and linux-kernel, and
try to figure it out more in netdev...
