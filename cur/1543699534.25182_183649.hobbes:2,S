Greg can speak to this better than I, but udev is most certainly 
intended to completely replace /dev.  The thing is that not everything 
exports the required information in /sys just yet.
If you start up udev and then run the script that comes with it that 
parses all the pre-existing /sys entries, it will build a pretty decent 
set of device nodes.  Eventually it is intended that this will be 
mounted at /dev, which could be an on-disk filesystem or else a 
tmpfs-based one.
Once all the information is in /sys, then static /dev will go away 
forever.  (Which is good, since device numbers will be random in 2.7.)
