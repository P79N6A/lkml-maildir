That's an issue for FreeS/WAN (hhtp://www.freeswan.org) and other
crypto applications, especially on servers, on any architecture.
This, and other questions about /dev/random, were extensively
discussed on the FreeS/WAN list and a couple of other crypto lists
about a year back. Most of that is archived at:
http://www.openpgp.net/random/index.html
My impression is that he stopped archiving before the discussion
ended, but there is some good stuff there.
