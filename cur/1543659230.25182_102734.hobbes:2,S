Hi Jeff,
	We may yet want such a primitive, but I've been resisting it
for the moment.
	Firstly, because it's a very specialized and rare case which
lends itself to being abused, and secondly because if I "rmmod --wait"
the module, then such operations which try to hold the module in place
*should* fail.  Not doing so is impolite, at least.
	Sure, it's a fairly strange corner case, but that argument
cuts both ways.
I prefer this patch (-EBUSY is a little unusual, but as clear as any).
Thoughts?
Rusty.
