  Passing the -j option to make either (a) starts N processes at the
initial level and implies -j1 for submakes, (b) starts N processes at base
level each of which get the -jN and use it, or (c) -jN means run a total
of N processes shared between everything running. The [abc] depends on the
make you run, BSD, xmake, old GNU, new GNU, etc.
  No that doesn't clarify things, the correct answer is "it depends." I
have always used the environment variable with older GNU make, havent
rethought it on very recent systems. I suggest that N be Nproc+1 for best
results, but I've never had more than four CPUs with a build large enough
to measure.

  I general -pipe is a bad thing for uni, non-win for SMP (for any -j)
although I have often thought that making the pipe buffer larger might
change that.
