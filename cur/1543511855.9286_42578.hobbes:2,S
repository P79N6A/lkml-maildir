Hi,
I'm currently using 2.2.12 with nfs (client side) connected to a sun
server.
We've noticed the following messages in the log and are wondering
what they mean exactly and if they are a cause for worry:
Oct  7 09:30:46 flush kernel: nfs_rmdir: DblR2/help inode busy?? i_count=3, i
_nlink=4 
Oct  7 12:24:23 flush kernel: __nfs_fhget: killing port/images filehandle 
Oct  7 12:24:23 flush kernel: nfs_dentry_delete: IMAGES/BUTTONS: ino=810386, count=2, nlink=2 
Oct  7 12:24:23 flush kernel: __nfs_fhget: inode 804200 still busy, i_count=2 
Oct  7 12:26:06 flush kernel: nfs_lookup: cd32/.term ino=4012777 in use, count=2, nlink=2
