> [TG3]: Fix suspend/resume problem.
> 
> Joachim Deguara <joachim.deguara@amd.com> reported that tg3 devices
> would not resume properly if the device was shutdown before the system
> was suspended.  In such scenario where the netif_running state is 0,
> tg3_suspend() would not save the PCI state and so the memory enable bit
> and bus master enable bit would be lost.
> 
> We fix this by always saving and restoring the PCI state in
> tg3_suspend() and tg3_resume() regardless of netif_running() state.
