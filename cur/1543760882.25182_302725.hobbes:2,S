Yeah, I use the startup output all the time for stuff like that, no question 
it's useful.

Ok, and for the development kernel that makes a lot of sense.  But as we've 
seen from this thread, leaving in old printks that were once useful but no 
longer are tends to clutter things up and hide real errors.  I'd like to see 
us get better about that--reporting real errors better and keeping the junk 
to a minimum.
