Which immediately collided with 'static struct bus_type {...}'
hidden in drivers/net/tulip/de4x5.c and, as result, the later does
not compile anymore.  These two "bus_types" are quite dissimilar. :-)
An obvious and trivial fix was to globally replace "bus_type"
in de4x5.c with "de4x5_bus_type" (or this should be done in some
other manner).
