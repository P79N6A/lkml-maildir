With this patch applied I've had three total system lockups with
the usual workload.  No diagnostics, no interrupts, NMI watchdog
doesn't catch it.  Nice.   This is not related to networking; I
wasn't able to do much network stress testing because the
darn APIC bug kept biting me.  Grumble.
I'll try -pre9.
