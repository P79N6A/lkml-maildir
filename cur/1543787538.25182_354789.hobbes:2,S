I booted FreeBSD 6.0 and it seemed to reconize the card and attached
hard drive ok.  In the dmesg for freebsd, it mentioned 372N, if that
means anything.  There is a patch, I discovered, which disables the
driver from marking a 372A chipset from being detected as a 372N chip.
When I applied the patch, it finally detected the sata driver ok and my
new sata drive as well.  So my current hpt366 driver is as patched
below.  I added a check for a NULL drvdata to prevent the driver from
seg faulting when it failed to detect my chip, and I disabled a check
for the 372N chipset.

I sense much NT in you.
NT leads to Bluescreen.
Bluescreen leads to downtime.
Downtime leads to suffering.
NT is the path to the darkside.
Powerful Unix is.
