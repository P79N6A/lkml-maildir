The badness in local_bh_enable part is well-known (but I don't know
whether anybody fixed it in -mm already). It was (is?) must-fix bug
#1 on Andrew's list.
(What happens is that do_tty_hangup() does
	local_irq_save(flags); // FIXME: is this safe?
	*flush_buffer(tty);
where the flush buffer ends up calling ppp_async_push(), which does
	spin_lock_bh ... spin_unlock_bh
and spin_unlock_bh() calls local_bh_enable() which does
	WARN_ON(irqs_disabled());
So, we know that it happens, and why it happens, and can trivially
remove the symptom with an ostrich head-in-sand patch.)
This happens when pppd dies. I don't know why your pppd has problems.
