What about SD controllers on SPI bus? I did work with 2. ;-)

I didn't claim that scatterlist is to be used. We use 'hardware-driven' 
structures for sg lists.

That won't work in some cases, as SPI might generate additional clock 
cycles after each transfer which won't happen un case of real sg transfer.

It's possible in some cases but won't work in other. See above.

I'm afraid that copying may be implicit.

As for our core implementation it's totally agnostic about what kind of 
addresses is used and what way it should be handled in; it's all left 
for controller driver to decide. I still think it's far better approach 
than lotsa pointers and flags.
