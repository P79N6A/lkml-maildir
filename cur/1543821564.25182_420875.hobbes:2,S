Are you talking about me perchance?  I don't really care about precision
_that_ much, though I certainly do want to tighten timeslice accounting.
Given that most people are going to end up using the pm_timer anyway, I
don't see the point of even having a sched_clock().  If it's jiffy
resolution, it's useless.  If it's wildly inaccurate (as it is in the
SMP case, monotonicity issues aside) it's more than useless.
