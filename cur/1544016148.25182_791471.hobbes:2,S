This commit breaks mapping any RAM page through /dev/mem, as the
reserve_memtype() was not initializing the return attribute type and as such
corrupting the PTE entry that was setup with the return attribute type.
Because of this bug, application mapping this RAM page through /dev/mem
will die with "Corrupted page table at address xxxx" message in the kernel
log and also the kernel identity mapping which maps the underlying RAM
page gets converted to UC.
Fix this by initializing the return attribute type before calling
reserve_ram_pages_type()
