This doesn't work on highmem machines - doing the conversion from "<struct
page, offset>" to "page_address(page)+offset" is simply not legal (not
even for pure hashing purposes - page_address() changes as you kmap it).
You need to keep the <struct page,offset> tuple in that format, and no
other. And when you actually touch the page, you need to do the
kmap()/kunmap() (and you must not keep it mapped while you sleep, because
that might trivially make the kernel run out of virtual mappings).
