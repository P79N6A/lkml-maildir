Realizing that this is a bit of a headache for the kernel maintainers, but
why isn't anyone else suggesting options in the kernel config?  I believe
that the compatibility patches should be included in the kernel by
default, but could be deselected during a custom kernel config.  The
patches could be bundled by platform, so ifdef SUN_PATCH, then all Sun
related patches get included. 
Our site uses FTP Software's PC/TCP suite, and until the problems in that
suite were fixed, I always compiled in the compatibility option included
in the kernel.
I believe that separating the patches from the kernel source is a bad idea
as the kernel should maintain maximum compatability by default without
forcing users to search for patches, but I do agree with jamal that giving
the sysadmin the option to leave out unused compatibility code is
desirable.  It also lets the kernel config documentation point out broken
implementations.
