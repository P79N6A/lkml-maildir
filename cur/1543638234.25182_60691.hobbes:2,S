Sure, but I guess the kernel is supposed to use virtual 86 mode
to emulate real mode. If it really is true that AC is honoured
in virtual 86 mode but ignored in real mode, then the kernel
should be changed to not enable that flag en virtual 86 mode.
The flag itself should still be simulated using other means.
This would be similar to the use of the use of the VIF flag to
emulate the IF flag. This flag has actually got me wondering:
AFAIR the flag is mentioned in Intel specs, but it looks like
in Linux the flag is implemented 100% in software with no help
from the CPU. Is that correct, or did I miss something?
