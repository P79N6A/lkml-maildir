I too need to decide whether to base my little sg.c,st.c patchset
on top of Kai's (as I see in 2.6.15-rc3-mm1, I presume) or on top
of 2.6.15-rc4.

I'm assuming from this that I'd best base on 2.6.15-rc4;
but by all means overrule me if you've changed your mind.

What I see in 2.6.15-rc3-mm1 looks like three patches.
One to do with resetting sg_segs to 0 at various points:
I've no appreciation of that patch at all.  If it would help you for
me to add that into my little set, please send me a comment for it.
One to add an "is_read" argument to release_buffering.  Yes, that's
a part of my set too, though in my case called "dirtied" (and I believe
that the call at the end of st_read can say 0, because that's just for
an error path: when it's really dirtied user memory, it'll be read_tape
that does the release_buffering).  sg.c was always saying dirtied, even
when writing from memory; st.c was always saying not dirtied, even when
reading into memory.  Usually the latter is okay, get_user_pages has
said dirty in advance; but under pressure there's a window whereby it's
not good enough.  And SetPageDirty can be counter-productive these days,
so your patch is incomplete in that regard: I'll explain more in mine.
One to move around where release_buffering is called from:
that's the part you've decided was wrong, or at least unnecessary.

I didn't understand that bit, but I probably don't need to.
