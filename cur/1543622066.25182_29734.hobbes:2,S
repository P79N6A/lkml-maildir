Or, you can put the console on the second tty, and then you will not see the
messages unless you want to. 
Compile in support for console on virtual terminal, and also VGA text console
or one of the framebuffer consoles.
Then use append="console=/dev/tty2 CONSOLE=/dev/tty2", and you won't
see anything on the boot screen except the linux logo (if you choose a 
framebuffer console).  But, you can type "Alt-F2" to bring up the second 
console with the boot messages on it.  This is useful when things go wrong.
If you want a prettier boot logo, check out www.arnor.net/linuxlogo for some
patches that let you build in any logo you want at kernel compile time.
