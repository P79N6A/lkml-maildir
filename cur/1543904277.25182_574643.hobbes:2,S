It generates frame pointers, but that's not that bad.  I'm not 
aware of any other bad side effects. Ok the compiler will limit
your goto usage, but that's more a good thing.
But since you always have to strictly limit the array in kernel code anyways
you could as well just allocate the fixed limit.
