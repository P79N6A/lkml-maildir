That's not the only point.
There are many cases you have to handle correctly. As a simple example,
CONFIG_W1=y, CONFIG_NET=m or CONFIG_W1=m, CONFIG_NET=m should compile as 
expected.
But hey, it's open source and much is possible. If you think this would 
be important send a patch and we have a basis for a discussion. 
Discussions about probable patches tend to become extremely fruitless.
