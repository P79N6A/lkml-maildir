Paul, I'm having second thoughts regarding a cpusets merge.  Having gone
back and re-read the cpusets-vs-CKRM thread from mid-August, I am quite
unconvinced that we should proceed with two orthogonal resource
management/partitioning schemes.
And CKRM is much more general than the cpu/memsets code, and hence it
should be possible to realize your end-users requirements using an
appropriately modified CKRM, and a suitable controller.
I'd view the difficulty of implementing this as a test of the wisdom of
CKRM's design, actually.
The clearest statement of the end-user cpu and memory partitioning
requirement is this, from Paul:

Now, even that is not a very good end-user requirement because it does
prejudge the way in which the requirement's solution should be implemented.
 Users don't require that their NUMA machines "model a hierarchy of
'virtual computers'".  Users require that their NUMA machines implement
some particular behaviour for their work mix.  What is that behaviour?
For example, I am unable to determine from the above whether the users
would be 90% satisfied with some close-enough ruleset which was implemented
with even the existing CKRM cpu and memory governors.
So anyway, I want to reopen this discussion, and throw a huge spanner in
your works, sorry.
I would ask the CKRM team to tell us whether there has been any progress in
this area, whether they feel that they have a good understanding of the end
user requirement, and to sketch out a design with which CKRM could satisfy
that requirement.
Thanks.
