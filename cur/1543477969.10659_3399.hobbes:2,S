	OK, built a UP version of pre6 and tried for 2 hours last
evening, worked OK. This morning it was alive, but receive channel of
etho in ifconfig had accumulated about 4000 errors. About an hour later
the net died with same symptoms.
	Probably unrelated: Tried building pre7, both UP and SMP. No
problem with build, but unusable. At boot i get:
Loading pre7............
Uncompressing Linux...
Out of memory
-- System halted
and there it sits. With 64MB usable, I suspect the error message is
inexact. Haven't had that problem for literally years, and I can't
recall what the problem was then. Backing out the pre7 patches builds a
"good" pre6 kernel as before, and the failure reproduces both SMP and
UP. Looks like it's my week/month for troubles, after several months of
clear sailing.
