The current usage of select in the kernel covers many select's of 
symbols that actually have a prompt.
I assume Sam thinks in the direction to let a symbol inherit the 
dependencies off all symbols it selects.
E.g. in
config A
	depends on B
config C
	select A
C should be treated as if it would depend on B.
