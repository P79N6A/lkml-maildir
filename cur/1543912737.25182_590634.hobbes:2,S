but this is deviating from the basic principle that these things are
not regular Kconfig "config" settings -- they are a new beast
entirely, and need a new infrastructure to support them.
put another way, they are not a normal kernel feature to be selected
or deselected.  they are, rather, *attributes* that can be *applied*
to kernel features, in the same way as is done with "bool" or
"string".  making these things regular config directives defeats the
whole purpose.
