The problem is that in many options required to make that happen in the 
o/s, hardware, and application are going to kill performance. And even 
if you can control order of write, unless you can get write to final 
non-volatile media control you can get a sane database but still lose 
transactions.
If there was a way for the o/s to know when a physical write was done 
other than using flushes to force completion, then overall performance 
could be higher, but individual transaction might have greater latency. 
And the app could use fsync to force order of write as needed. In many 
cases groups of writes can be done in any order as long as they are all 
done before the next logical step takes place.
This would change the meaning of fsync from "force out the data" to 
"wait for the data to be written" in some implementations.
