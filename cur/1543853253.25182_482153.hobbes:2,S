mmc_queue_thread() will empty the thread when MMC_QUEUE_EXIT is set. The
problem is that we do not set that bit until the last person closes the
device. In order to avoid problems we need to empty the queue before
mmc_blk_remove() exits (after which the card structure is no longer valid).

Ok, that's one less problem for me to worry about. :)

I do:
del_gendisk();
(wait for queue to become empty, i.e. elv_next_request() == NULL)
blk_cleanup_queue();
and then assume that the request function will no longer be called for
this queue.
