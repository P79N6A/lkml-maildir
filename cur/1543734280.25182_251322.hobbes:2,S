Alan, if you will commit Redhat to implementing all of the features
referenced in this message:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/8/2/111
then I'll back off and go work on the X server.
Use whatever mechanism you want, but implement all of the features. 
There are two main goals:
#1) Get mesa-solo running with superbuffers, this means memory
allocation and mode setting have to be fixed. This will be the base
platform for X on GL.
#2) Support independent users logged into each head. One using the
console with fbdev and the other X and a 3D game.
