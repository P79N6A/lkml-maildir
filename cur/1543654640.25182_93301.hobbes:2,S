It's a practical limit.  The mem_map array alone would consume 720 megabytes,
so you have no normal-zone memory left.
At 16G, mem_map[] consumes 180 megabytes and there's 540ish megabytes
of normal zone left for general use.
Even at this 20:1 highmem:lowmem ratio, the system will be struggling.
Any time you have normal-zone data structures which are pinned by
pages, the maths gets you in the end.
buffer_heads, pagetable pages, radix-tree nodes, pte_chains and inodes
are normal-zone data structures which, depending on the kernel version,
may be pinned into the normal zone by highmem pages.
In 2.5, with ext2's no-buffer-head option, shared pagetables, highpte,
with your fingers crossed and the wind in the south east, 32G might
be practical.
