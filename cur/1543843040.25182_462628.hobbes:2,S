Hmmm... Beancounters can provide this after trivial changes.
We may schedule them in current set of "pending" features
(
http://wiki.openvz.org/UBC_discussion
)
But this can create a kind of DoS within an application:
  A thread continuously touches new and new pages to it's BC and
these pages are get touched by other threads also. Sooner or later
this BC will hit it's limit and reclaiming this set of pages would affect
all the other threads.
Also such accounting reveals you NOTHING about real memory usage.
E.g. 100Mb charged for one BC can mean "this BC ate 100Mb of
memory" as well as "this BC uses one page really, but all the others
are just used by other threads" and anything between these two
corner cases.
Well. We've digressed from our main thread - discussing (dis)advantages
of current BC implemenation.
