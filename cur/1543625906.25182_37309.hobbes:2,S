Hello,
Is blockdev --flushbufs supposed to work on /dev/ram0 if it was loaded as
initrd ramdisk? I unmount it and try to free the memory but hit this
EBUSY in drivers/block/rd.c:rd_ioctl():
                        /* special: we want to release the ramdisk memory,
                           it's not like with the other blockdevices where
                           this ioctl only flushes away the buffer cache. */
                        if ((atomic_read(&inode->i_bdev->bd_openers) > 2))
                                return -EBUSY;
The kernel is 2.4.9 but this code is almost the same in 2.4.18. So, who is
this opener that keeps the inode->i_bdev->bd_openers too high?
Regards,
Tigran
