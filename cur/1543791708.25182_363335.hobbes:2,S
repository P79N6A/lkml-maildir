Similarly, that SGI patch which was rejected 6-12 months ago to kill off
processes once they started swapping.  We thought that it could be done
from userspace, but we need a way for userspace to detect when a task is
being swapped on a per-task basis.
I'm thinking a few numbers in the mm_struct, incremented in the pageout
code, reported via /proc/stat.
