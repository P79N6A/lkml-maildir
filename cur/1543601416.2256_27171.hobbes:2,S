Umm...  Linus, had you actually read through the fs/block_device.c part
of that?  It's not just ugly as hell, it's (AFAICS) not hard to oops
if you have several inodes sharing major:minor.  ->bd_inode and its
treatment are bogus.  Please, read it through and consider reverting -
in its current state code is an ugly mess.
