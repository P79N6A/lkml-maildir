Old IDE -> /dev/hd*
LibATA -> /dev/sd*
so if you build both sets of modules it depends who gets loaded first.

32bit I/O and multi-sector I/O are PIO specific features - they have no
effect on DMA performance. 32bit is on my todo list but very low priority
as for most systems it makes almost no difference.
