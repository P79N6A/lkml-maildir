Looks like Andrea found the real culprit.

| Now that I understand better the math around scanned and lru_pages I

| "nr" is because they pass 0 to shrink all slabs entries. As said in the
| previous email they lockup when invoking the slab shrinking with the
| toss-cache feature.  They should have passed "tossed" as third parameter
| too, not 0.
| 
| 			int tossed = atomic_read(&npgs_tossed);
| 			shrink_slab(tossed, GFP_KERNEL, 0 /* shrink max */);
| 			atomic_set(&npgs_tossed, 0);
| 
| The zero as thrid parameter means nr will be "max_pass * scanned", so if
| both the page-lru is huge and the icache is huge, that can lead to an
| huge value.
| 
| They should also add a WARN_ON to be sure that "tossed" is never
| negative just in case: when the "tossed" gets sign zero extended during
| the int2unsigned-long conversion, that could generate the huge number if
| tossed was negative.
| 
| So the caller has to be fixed too, even if now it would be ok to pass 0
| without risking huge nr values (after fixing the unrelated __GFP_IO bug).
| 
| So hopefully the "0" as third parameter is good enough to explain the
| (other) real bug and we won't be hiding more bugs with this fix.

| Agreed.

CC'ed some of the folks who debugged this, in case they have anything to
add.
