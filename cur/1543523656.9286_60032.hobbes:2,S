I get the following in my log file:
colombia kernel: gfp called by non-running (1) task from c0118ab2! 
[c0118a98 t do_wp_page]
colombia kernel: gfp called by non-running (1) task from c0118e96! 
[c0118e68 t do_anonymous_page]
colombia kernel: gfp called by non-running (1) task from c012058a! 
[c0120558 T read_swap_cache_async]
The do_anonymous_page one seems to be fairly reliably reproduced by
performing cvs updates over NFS. The other two I have not been able to
associate with any particular activity.
Cheers,
Chris.
