Hi Ingo,
This series does more unification of pgalloc, and creates a unified
mm/pgtable.c for common pagetable functions.  Ends up removing
pgalloc_32/64.h in favour of pgalloc.h.
[ I thought I'd mailed this earlier, but I don't see it on lkml.
Maybe I created the mbox without sending it.  Anyway, this should go
before the set I just mailed. ]
Thanks,
	J
