Because the use of:
        case SCSI_IOCTL_GET_IDLUN:
        case SCSI_IOCTL_GET_BUS_NUMBER:
At first, I thought the solution should be make
cciss dependent on CONFIG_SCSI.  Then James Bottomley
convinced me otherwise, and my first instinct was just
to comment out those cases above, since they fall through
to a default case anyway.  Then Christoph Hellwig commented
that with CONFIG_SCSI, we picked up scsi/scsi.h which made
it compile, but only accidentally.  So then I thought to 
include scsi/scsi.h unconditionally.  If it would be preferable
to just comment out those cases and let the default case
handle it, that's fine be me too.
