Hmm....  Oh, lovely - so we have that non-zero if set, 0 if it's i386 or
amd64 and not set and not defined if it's ia64 and not set.
Sigh...  It should be left as #if, of course, but I suspect that cleaner way to
deal with that would be (in Kconfig)
config ACPI_BLACKLIST_YEAR
        int "Disable ACPI for systems before Jan 1st this year" if X86
        default 0
