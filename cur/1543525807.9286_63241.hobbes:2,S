In my view H.323 is something that can live in user space perfectly
well. It's also extremly complex, and you wouldn't want something
like that in your kernel.

Please join the projects that are already on the way:
The H.323 stack is at 
http://www.openh323.org
,
a gatekeeper is at 
http://www.willamowius.de/openh323gk.html
and an ISDN gateway is at 
http://www.telos.de/linux/H323.
Cheers,
