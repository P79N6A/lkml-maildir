Well, if you mean by this the while-loop below, the original code offloads
the pipeline gradually, stage-wise, until allocation succeeds, in contrast to
idetape_wait_for_pipeline() which iterates over all pending stages and flushes
them all in one go.
At a certain in point in time, however, the driver might land at the unlikely
state of still having some stages left in the pipeline while queueing all
incoming requests on the rq queue. Therefore, i'd prefer to make sure the
pipeline is empty before queueing. What is more, it is flushed only once, if
ever, so idetape_wait_for_pipeline() simply returns in subsequent calls and no
considerable performance penalties are imposed here.

I did this simply to keep behavior changes at minimum - after removing the
pipeline code completely this'll be simplified too.
