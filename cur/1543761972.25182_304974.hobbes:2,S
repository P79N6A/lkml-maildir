You wont catch RCU read-sides already entered - see below.

In fact I am working on clean 2.6.12-rc1 right now. I figured this is
orthorgonal to the rest RT patch and can probably go upstream immediately.
Seemed to work. I'll try to make into a clean patch soonish and also try
it on -40-04. 
I am trying to make a boosting mechanism in the scheduler such that RCU
readers are boosted to MAX_RT_PRIO when preempted. I have to take it out
first.
Any specific tests I have to run? I am considering making an RCU test
device.

A nice 19 task, A, enter an RCU region and is preempted. A lot of other
tasks starts running. Then task A might starved for _minuttes_ such that
there is no RCU-grace periods in all that time.
