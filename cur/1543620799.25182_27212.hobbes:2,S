Try to do this. Open drivers/sound/Config.in, and find YMFPCI
tristate, then delete $CONFIG_SOUND_OSS from that line.
Edit .config, and remove CONFIG_SOUND_OSS. Rerun make oldconfig,
when prompted for CONFIG_SOUND_OSS, say N. This should work.
I use monolithic kernels on 2.4, but on 2.5 it is officially
discouraged, so I gave up on it.
I do not see ANYTHING in 2.5.4 Makefiles that depended on
CONFIG_SOUND_GAMEPORT. This option only works to restric
some configurations choices, but it does not control any
compilations. Seems like a deadwood to me. Just kill it too.
