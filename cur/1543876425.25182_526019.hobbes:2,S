I think this can be solved by having the network auto-configure itself 
and make the startup scripts responsible for bringing up the interface 
and starting dhcp server on that interface. This is simple and does not 
require changes to the images. (it takes care of dns, ntp, smb, etc..)

That would certainly complicate things quite a bit.

I reckon that one critical thing which could drastically increase the 
user base would be to have a working virtual framebuffer implementation.
