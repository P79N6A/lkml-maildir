Subject: [PATCH] libertas: select WIRELESS_EXT
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/30/250

Ensure that libertas selects WIRELESS_EXT, since selecting other stuff
that should depend on WEXT, like IEEE80211, doesn't seem to drag that in
for us.
For 2.6.24 and later.
