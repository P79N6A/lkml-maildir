The only thing I received was a 'this patch has been dropped from

You have basically done a couple of (functionally) totally pointless
changes, like
	- not using iterator-style array traversals, but indexed ones
          instead
	- doing the calculation to determine the endpoint type in
          three different places instead of in one place, because the
          somewhat silly endpoint classification interfaces enforces
          this
	- not using a single switch-statement but an if-else-cascade,
          again due to limitations of that interface
	- replacing the while-loop with an identical for-loop
The net effect of these changes is that an optimizing compiler will
have to work somewhat more to remove all the redundant stuff that
was added. As for 'proper coding style', the code conforms to what is
documented as 'proper kernel coding style'. If this assumption of mine
is incorrect, I'd be happy to hear about reasons why this would be so,
to take them into account for eventual future patches.

I think I'll just resend the working one in this case. But the logic
appears to be identical, so I do not so a reason why it shouldn't.
