I believe that is what Christoph is proposing. It does simplify certain
things, not least preventing someone from moving the .gfs2_admin directory
to somewhere other than the root directory of the filesystem or even
removing it completely which would otherwise need to be added as special
cases.
On the otherhand, its not clear to me at the moment, exactly how to
implement this bearing in mind that both the "normal" filesystem and
the metadata filesystem are really one and the same as far as journaling
and locking are concerned. Perhaps what's needed is one fs with two
different roots. I'm still looking into the best way to do this,
Steve.
