nod.  It's probably even simpler than that.  By merely updating
'last_empty_jifs" when we decide to create the next pdflush thread, we
could easily account for _most_ of the races without adding significant
overhead.  
I say most because the assumption would be that we will be successful in
creating the new thread.  Not that bad an assumption I think.  Besides,
the consequences of a miss are not harmful.

Could be...  However bear in mind that we traverse *filesystems*, not
block devs with background_writeout() (the pdflush work function). 
But even if we did block devices, consider that we still don't know the
speed of those devices (consider SSD v. raid v. disk) and consequently,
we don't know how many threads to throw at the device before it becomes
congested and we're merely spinning our wheels.  I mean, an SSD at
500MB/s (or greater) certainly could handle more pages being thrown at
it than an IDE drive... 
And this ties back to MAX_WRITEBACK_PAGES (currently 1k) which is the
chunk that we write out in one pass.   In order to not "hold the inode
lock too long", this is the chunk we attempt to write out.  
What is the right magic number for the various types of block devs?  1k
for all?  for all time?  :-)
Anyway, back to the traversal of filesystems.  In writeback_inodes(), we
currently traverse the super block list in reverse.  I don't quite
understand why we do this, but <shrug>.  
What this does mean is that unfairly penalize certain file systems when
attempting to clean dirty pages.  If I have 5 filesystems, all getting
hit on, then the last one in will always be the 'cleanest'.   Not sure
that makes sense.  
I was thinking about a patch that would go both directions - forward and
reverse depending upon, say, a bit in jiffies...  Certainly not perfect,
but a bit more fair.  
Actually, it seems to me that we need to look at a radically different
approach.  What about making background writes a property of the super
block? (which implies the file system)  Has that been discussed before?
Best,
