CONFIG_LBD is on. GCC is 'Gentoo 3.3.5.20050130-r1', if it matters.
FWIW, the machine is running 32-bit, although the cpus appear to support
EM64T. The filesystem's size is 138410144 1k-blocks; ext3 is using 4k
blocks/inodes.
This was not a problem on the previous kernel which was 2.6.13-rc3 with
the assert on net/ipv4/tcp_output.c:918 disabled (from memory, even the
line number ;-) ).
