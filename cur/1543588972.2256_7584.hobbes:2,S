Hi: Been battling w. my new Gravis joystick [kernel 2.4.3-ac5] - the
driver wouldn't recognise it through the gameport, but would through the
USB port [the stick came with a converter]. I did have one problem though:
I had to apply the following one line patch to get the joystick hat to
work correctly: Don't know if this is generally correct, as I only have
one USB joystick with which to test it.
