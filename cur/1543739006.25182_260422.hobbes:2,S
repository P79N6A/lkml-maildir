Actually, linked lists are mostly  used in structure sets, which means
that one  pointer more or less  doesn't hurt too much,  compared to an
O(N)  overhead  in  certain  edit  actions on  the  list  (prepending,
deleting, moving).
Seems that  you can  only write  small *or* fast  code. But  that's no
news.
