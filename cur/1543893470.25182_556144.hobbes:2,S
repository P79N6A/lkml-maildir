Hi.
Wouldn't it be much more useful if it was unconditionally compiled in
and controlled instead by a sysfs entry? That way it will be far more
useful to $user who doesn't know or want to know how to compile and
install a kernel, but wants to do what they can to get provide helpful
debugging info and perhaps even get it going.
Yes, Pavel, I'll supply a patch if you (plural) agree.
Regards,
Nigel
