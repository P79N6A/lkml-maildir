I would prefer users have the ability to put one or two truly critical RT
tasks above keventd & family.  Such tasks would have to follow certain rules
.. run & sleep quick .. limited or no device IO ..  most communication to
other tasks through shared memory .. possibly others.
There are those willing to follow whatever rules necessary & split up their
application into tasks any which way in order to get high responsiveness to a
critical but small part of their application.  If you follow the rules, you
should be allowed to put a carefully crafted task above the system daemons
(with the possible exception of the migration daemon).
