I am working on a new framebuffer driver for an LCD controller that's
custom to the PowerPC embedded world.  As such, it's architecture
dependent.  Where should I place the driver in the tree, and how should I
set up the proper Configure options?  Where do I put checks for #ifdef
CONFIGURE_blah_blah_blah?
Yours truly,
David Eger
