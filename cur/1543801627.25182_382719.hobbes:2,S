I'll upload the delay accounting patches to a newly created lse-tech package.

I don't expect the lock contention to be high. The lock is held for a
very short time (across two additions/increments). Moreover, it gets
contended only when the stats are being read (either through /proc or connectors).
Since the reading of stats won't be that frequent (the utility of these
numbers is to influence the I/O priority/rss limit etc. which won't be done
at a very small granularity anyway), I wouldn't expect a problem.
But its better to take some measurements anyway. Any suggestions on a
benchmark ?

Please do. If this accounting can fit into some other framework, thats fine too.
