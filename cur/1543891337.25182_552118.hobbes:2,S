Sure.  My primary point was to document this, and get things moving if
possible to fix it.  This patch is 2.6.23 at the earliest, so there is
some time to work on it even on the most optimistic merge schedule.
I just don't want to be complacent and let this problem sit undetected
in back corner any more.
