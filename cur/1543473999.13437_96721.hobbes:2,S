I have two PPro SMP systems with 3c905 NICs which exhibit this problem
("Socket Destroy Delayed" messages in syslogd kern).  It started with
2.2.0pre1 and is still there with 2.2.0pre3.  I didn't even try
2.2.0pre2.  One motherboard is a SuperMicro and the other is Tyan.  Both
kernels are static (not modular) with the minimum amount of goodies. 
Anyone else seeing these errors?  Try syslogging kern.* to
/var/log/kernel and take a look.  Thanks!
