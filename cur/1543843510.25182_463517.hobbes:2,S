And who should pay here? The people who want the tracepoints or the

You have obviously never tried to maintain a codebase for a long
time. Even if the code is not activated, you make a change and
something breaks and people come running and screaming, or the thing
is in the way for the structural code change you want to make.
Not to mention that some of the classical places people wish to add
those static tracepoints are in performance sensitive codepaths,
syscalls for example.

You can do pretty much everything you want to do with dynamic
tracepoints, it's just a matter of whether you want to dump the burden
of maintenance on someone else. Been there done that, had to show
people in the past how to do with dynamic points what they insisted
had to be done with static points.

So you maintain the tracepoints in the kernel and you are offering to
take over maintenance of all code that now contain these tracepoints?
You add your static tracepoints, next week someone else wants some
very similar but slightly different points, the following week it's
someone else. Thanks, but no thanks.

Some evidence would be useful here, so far you haven't provided any.
