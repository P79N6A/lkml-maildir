That wouldn't have helped me in this case at all.
I had 4 firmware patches to apply, each one had to add entries
to the same file.
The first patch had to be skipped.
So the second one, which is the first one I added (which is the acenic
bogon with the missed delete), is the one GIT wouldn't take but patch
would.
GIT blobs wouldn't give me any help here, but I suppose the fuzz stuff
might have.
I really just want stupid 'patch' behavior.  I'll check the result
carefully, so just apply the thing instead of making me jump through
hoops. :-)
