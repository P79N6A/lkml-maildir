I tried that in 2.6.5-rc1-mm1, restarted sane, but it still fails. 
scanimage -L does not find the scanner, sane-find-scanner finds it, but 
says I have scsi modules loaded, even though I've rmmod them. I'm using 
a recent CVS libusb and sane.
I found an article on linuxtoday.com that pointed me to vuescan where I 
downloaded their initial linux release and the scanner (Epson USB 610) 
works fine using it. It uses the libusb-0.1.so.4.4.1 I have installed, 
so that points back to a problem with sane which I have added to their 
bug list.
Regards
Sid.
