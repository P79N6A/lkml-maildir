Arjan seems right:
22:07 ichi:/dev/shm > cat test.c
#include <stdio.h>
static const char *x[] = {"0", "1", NULL};
int main(void) {
    int i;
    for(i = 0; i < 3; ++i)
        printf("%s\n", x[i]);
    return 0;
}
22:07 ichi:/dev/shm > cc test.c -c && nm test.o | grep x
00000000 d x
22:07 ichi:/dev/shm > cc test.c -c -O2 && nm test.o | grep x
00000000 r x
>(even if gcc does this perfect I'm still in favor of the explicit const,
