Happily, all that code just got deleted:
    Also the new poll() interface to /proc/mounts is a nicer way to
    notify about changes than sending events through the core.
    The uevents should only be used for driver core related requests to
    userspace now.
I dunno how this removal works with forward- and backward- compatible
userspace.   Maybe it doesn't.

Maybe.  We've got in trouble in the past with making mounts try to get
exclusive access.  I can't immediately remember what the problem was.

Sounds reasonable.

The printk in kobject_register() will oops if kobj->name is null, so yes,
it seems reasonable to make kobject_register() fail up-front if there's no
->name.   Greg agree?
Helge, it would be good if you could try the same trick on 2.6.15-git9 or
-git10, see if it behaves correctly.
