It won't be dropped on the floor indefinitely.
"I do plan to look at this" means that I'd currently estimate this being 
2.6.19 stuff.
Yes that's one year from now, but we need it properly analyzed and 
tested before getting it into Linus' tree, and I do really want it 
untangled from and therefore after 4k stacks.

The problem with the stack is that average stack usage is relatively 
uninteresting - what matters is the worst case stack usage. And I'd 
expect the stack footprint improvements you see with less inlining in 
different places than the deteriorations with unit-at-a-time.
