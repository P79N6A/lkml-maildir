Hi!
I'm trying to install kernel 2.6.1 on a freshly installed Debian woody.
Well I got it working but ...
On 2.4.x I used to (soft) link
  /usr/src/linux-2.4.x/include/linux to /usr/include/linux
and
  /usr/src/linux-2.4.x/include/asm to /usr/include/asm
Well on 2.6.x .../include/linux is there, but .../include/asm is not.
I tried to link .../include/asm-i386 to .../include/asm (I've got an Intel
PC) ... but this doesn't let start the configuration run
(oldconfig/menuconfig).  Also some userlevel programms don't compile
correctly. - It seems that 2.6.x depends on the links in /usr/include ...
What I did now was to use my "old" asm (from 2.4.x) include directory
  ln -s /usr/src/linux-2.4.x/include/asm /usr/include/
and the "new" linux (from 2.6.x) include directory
  ln -s /usr/src/linux-2.6.x/include/linux /usr/include/
Which is probably not the correct way :( - What am I missing?
Help!
Thanx/Regards
