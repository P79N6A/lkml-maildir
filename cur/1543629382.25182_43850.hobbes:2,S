Hi,
I have a very similar problem... when I ping the box with the sis900 ethernet adapter everything wents fine except ~3 % of the pings. This pings need 10 times longer to get back to me than the other (eg. 72 ms <-> 1004 ms)
There is no other network activity on the network
And sometimes I get corrupted echo replies when there is traffic over the sis900...
I hope this helps somehow...
