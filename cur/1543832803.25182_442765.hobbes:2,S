Let me restate this a third time in another way. What I suggest is a 
system call, NOT NAMED CLOSE, which does a close and touch. This was all 
blue sky discussion, new system calls are as valid as nanosecond 
resolution and syncronization between servers. Since this is a new call 
it is not specified by POSIX.
And Linus has already suggested that he would accept something similar, 
when I proposed something like "noatime" mounts, which only updated 
atime and mtime on open and close, to keep metadata relevant but not 
have the overhead of constant updates.
Actually, now that I have more free time I may revisit that idea.
