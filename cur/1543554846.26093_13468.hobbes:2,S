Yes.
However, it definitely is an issue of making trade-offs. Most 64-bit MMU
models tend to have some flexibility in how you set up the page tables,
and it may be possible to just move bits around too (ie making both the
pmd and the pgd twice as large, and getting the expansion of 4 by doing
two expand-by-two's, for example, if the hardware has support for doing
things like that).
