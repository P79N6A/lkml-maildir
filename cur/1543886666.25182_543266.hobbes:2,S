"stupid legacy" were Linus' words.

How about this:
"The jiffies variable is a special case because there are too
many places in the kernel which would have to be changed and reviewed
if the volatile would be removed from jiffies. However, the
use of volatile qualifier for jiffies is just as wrong as
it is elsewhere. Don't use jiffies as an excuse to use volatile
in your code."
