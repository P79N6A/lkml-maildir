Ingo et al...
Since a lot of things have started tying into the NMI handler (oprofile, 
nmi watchdog, memory errors, bus error, now the IPMI watchdog), I think 
it better to use a request/release mechanism for the NMI handlers. 
 Plus, I think the current NMI code is actually not correct, it's 
theoretically possible to miss NMIs if two occur at the same time.  So 
I'm proposing the patch at 
http://home.attbi.com/~minyard/linux-nmi-v8.diff,
 relative to current 
2.5.  This has been posted on lkml, and reviewed by John Levon and others.
Thanks,
-Corey
