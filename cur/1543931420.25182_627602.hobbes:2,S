Early quirk seemed like the right thing to do to me.  Starting from boot up,
this (mis)configuration by the bios can mean that come cpus just don't get
interrupts.  I could imagine situations like serial console not working if the
serial port interrupt was routed to a cpu that used extended APIC id.  I've
never actually observed it happening, but making sure that all cpus were
eligible to get interrupts early in the boot process made sense to me.
