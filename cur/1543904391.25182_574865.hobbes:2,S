Well. I claim that the system is not running when cpu is in hlt.
...and on some weird machines (openmoko, olpc) they have hardware capable of
suspending most of machine between keypresses. Now, PCs are not there
yet, but sooner or later we will sleep/suspend between keypresses.
It is not worth changing now, but at least runtime suspend should
be accounted as 'running'.
