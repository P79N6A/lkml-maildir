The switch is possible. You could try the latest development LFS LiveCD 
(
http://ums.usu.ru/~patrakov/test/lfslivecd-x86-6.3-pre2-r1897.iso
) and see 
if it works for you (be sure to CC: me if you post any feedback). It will 
automatically configure the console using a simple menu-driven interface. 
Some interesting programs to try there: mutt, tin, lynx, finch.

Yes.

screen, jfbterm, iterm (jfbterm and iterm are not on my CD, but you can 
build them from source there - the filesystem on the CD can be written to). 
Note that jfbterm and iterm expect X fonts (or unifont) to be available, and 
the CD doesn't have these fonts (fully switched to Xft).
