Who changed it so that context was no longer allowed to sleep???
That's a very recent change ... I've done a fair amount of testing
in previous kernels and _never_ got that message on that path.
Why was that changed?  Are you sure it's not just a bug higher up
in the call stack?  Classically(*), both suspend() and resume()
methods are called in contexts that can sleep, so that's a big
change I'd expect to impact other drivers too.  In fact that'd
explain a lot of other messages I saw reported on the list...
