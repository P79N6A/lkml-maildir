Subject: net/sunrpc/clnt.c compilation error: tk_pid field

With linux-2.6.0-test7, I get compilation errors like:
     CC      net/sunrpc/clnt.o
   net/sunrpc/clnt.c:965: structure has no member named `tk_pid'
   net/sunrpc/clnt.c:970: structure has no member named `tk_pid'
   net/sunrpc/clnt.c:976: structure has no member named `tk_pid'
   make[2]: *** [net/sunrpc/clnt.o] Error 1
The reason seems to be that the tk_pid field is only included in
`struct rpc_task' (defined in include/linux/sunrpc/sched.h) if
DEBUG_RPC is defined, and DEBUG_RPC is only defined if CONFIG_SYSCTL
is defined (include/linux/sunrpc/debug.h).  I've enabled NFS, but not
CONFIG_SYSCTL:
   $ egrep '(SYSCTL|NFS|RPC)' .config
   # CONFIG_SYSCTL is not set
   CONFIG_NFS_FS=y
   CONFIG_NFS_V3=y
   CONFIG_NFS_V4=y
   # CONFIG_NFSD is not set
   CONFIG_SUNRPC=y
   CONFIG_SUNRPC_GSS=y
Most code in net/sunrpc only references the tk_pid field inside of calls
to `dprintk', which is a macro that does nothing unless DEBUG_RPC is
defined; however the three lines mentioned in the error messages above
use ordinary printks, and so don't compile unless DEBUG_RPC is defined.
Perhaps these three lines should also use dprintk.
