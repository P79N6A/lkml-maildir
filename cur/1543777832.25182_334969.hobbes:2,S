Hi,
Are there any caveats of sigwait (on RT signals) in
multithreaded application?
As suggested in the man page, i call 
# define SIG35 35
# define SIG36 36
sigaddset (&set, SIG36) ;
pthread_sigmask (SIG_BLOCK, &set, NULL);
at the beginning of the program (in main) before I
create any threads.
Then i register a signal handler for SIG35. The signal
handler i call sigwait for SIG36 as
    sigaddset (&set, SIG36) ; 
    pthread_sigmask (SIG_BLOCK, &set, NULL) ;      
    sigwait (&set, &signum) ; 
    if (signum == SIG_TASKRESUME)
    {
        printf ("Task is received SIG36\n") ;
    }
Is this usage right? I see that some times if run
strace on the particular thread that is currently in
sigwait and then kill strace with Ctrl+C, the threads
starts hogging CPU? Why should Ctrl+C wake up sigwait
on SIG36??
Am I missing something?  (Linux 9, 2.4 kernel)
Regards,
Pav.
