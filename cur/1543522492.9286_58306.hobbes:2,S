Perhaps we could have it sysctl/proc controlled. The cluster ID thing is
almost certainly best done by the user. Perhaps some variables like:
pid_mask (like the earlier proposed max_pid)
pid_or (set this to bitwise-or bits onto a pid, eg cluster ID)
       (yes, this value gets masked before being applied)
and maybe
tid_shift (how many bits to shift a thread id by before ORing it in)
tid_mask (more of the same)
...with defaults to make it work like it does now.
Though I think the thread id is kindof bogus - why would we want a thread
id space smaller than the process space, especially when it makes more
sense to have fifty zillion threads rather than processes? And threads are
just a narrow case of clone anyway.
