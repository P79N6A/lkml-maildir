Hello.
I was able to grab an open source driver from
supermicro's ftp while it was there. I made a few
modification to make it work with 2.6.x kernels and it
works very nice with 6 maxtor sata drives (I have a
supermicro card with 88sx5088 chip, but the driver may
fit the 608x too).
I'm willing to share it. The license says "Marvell",
but when I talked with the Marvell people who wrote it
they failed to answer clearly if it can be
redistributed.
Anyway, if someone needs it, I'll send it to him.
