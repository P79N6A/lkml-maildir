Hi Mr Johnson,
    Thanks for the mail. Actually I see that there is no fpu_control.h
in my src.
Thanks and Regards

First, to see if it's an access violation (#GP) or an actual FPE, set
the FPU unit to ignore /0 errors. You do it like this:
---------------
/*
 *  Note FPU control only exists per process. Therefore, you have
 *  to set up the FPU before you use it in any program.
 */
#include <i386/fpu_control.h>
#define FPU_MASK (_FPU_MASK_IM |\
                  _FPU_MASK_DM |\
                  _FPU_MASK_ZM |\
                  _FPU_MASK_OM |\
                  _FPU_MASK_UM |\
                  _FPU_MASK_PM)
void fpu()
{
//    __setfpucw(_FPU_DEFAULT & ~FPU_MASK);
    __setfpucw(_FPU_DEFAULT);
}
main() {
   double zero=0.0;
   double one=1.0;
   fpu();
   one /=zero;
}
--------------
With the above code, you can divide by zero with no problem. If you
unmask, using the FPU_MASK, you get the divide by zero error.
If your program now "functions", you have a real divide by zero error
that may be related to "real-world" data, that was not caught during
your initial testing.
If your program still fails, the error is really caused by the FPU
attempting to access memory you don't own. Note that all floating-pount
numbers exist as memory oprands in Intel stuff. So you could have an
out-of-bounds access or, perhaps, a stack- overflow.
Cheers,
