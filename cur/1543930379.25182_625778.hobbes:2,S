Its not a bug, its a feature! :-)

I have a good idea on how to annotate this, but not yet the time to do
so. Aside from the nesting problems, the dev->sem has other problems as
well. Converting this is rather non-trivial.
I'd not put it as harshly as you put it though, lockdep makes some
assumptions which can lead to false positives - otoh these assumptions
often end up pointing out 'curious' locking coupled to 'curious' data
structures. And fixing up these things often leads to better and simpler
code.
The emphasis is on often, this is one of the cases where this is not so.
So while it does restain the creativity of locking it often ends up
being for the better.
And while you might not see it in-tree anymore, lockdep does help out
tremendously while developing new code. I'm sure that without it the
locking would be in a much worse state than it is today.
