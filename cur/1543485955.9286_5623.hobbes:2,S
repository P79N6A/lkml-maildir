Just because this is vaguely interesting, and I hope on topic, it's
a good idea for your replacement init process to do a few things as
it boots. Such as mounting disks, firing up bdflush if necessary.
And you'll need a bunch of /dev entries, of course.
I recently built an embedded system using Linux for the kernel. You
got the specs dead on: modified LILO booted the kernel which ran my
custom statically linked /sbin/init replacement.
It made for an extremely quick boot process!
It'd be very interesting to get a minimal shell into the kernel. It
needn't be fancy, perhaps similar in usability to the open firmware
on powermacs or the boot bios on sparc gear.
Though I'm already hearing shouts of "user space"...
