I prefer to give a single response to points emerged in this thread.

Larry say :

I really like that guys that having read the last Intel ( or Digital. etc
... ) data sheet,
thinks to be God in earth, at a point to judge the knowledge of other guys.
I really like them.
My Mother taught me two basic things :
1) Have always respect of people that have respect of other people dignity
2) Always go in deep when analyzing things, and never stop at a superficial
view
Even if condition 1) has been repeatedly violated during this thread I'll
continue
to use educated and respective tones in my responses.
The first data sheet I've studied was the Intel 8088 one in fall 1984, and
I've continued until now since electronics and computer science is my
passion
as long as my work.
I don't want to bore other guys with cache lines architectures, computers
layouts, etc ...,
as long as I don't see this list as a way to recite data sheets to show
others own knowledge.
Reading data sheets don't makes You a guru, but simply a reader.
Using the gray material that You've inside that sphere that You've upon Your
shoulders,
this makes You a guru.
Anyway I've just placed an order to Amazon for "In search of clusters" and
"Computer Architecture, A Quantitative Approach".
These books will go to enrich my collection of readed and meditated books,
but I hope that the reading of these don't makes me another "reader guru",
that misses respect of other guys dignity.
It seems that this list has enough of them.
Horst say :

Another thing that I'll like is that people that want to speak about cache
misses
of my patch, should take a read to it before ( it's few lines of code ).

And also I'll like that my responses being readed.
The 3% is not on my vantage ( mine !?!? ) but It's a perf loose emerging
at 759000 switch / sec.
And is not random, as I've said in another message :
"They are a lower limit of a 16 test set", as Larry taught me.
Horst say :

How many switch / sec will do a system with RQ << 1 ?
Stay big say 500 ( keep this number in mind ).
Jamie say :

Take out another cache miss into the scheduler, multiply the time a cache
miss
takes for the number above ( 500 ), and weight it in one second.
What is Your improvement percent ?
<UNDERLINE>
More, the actual implementation, due to the fact that linearly scan RQ, have
a number
of "distant" memory loads that are directly proportional to the number of
processes in RQ.
DL = |p - p->next_run| >> Cache load cluster
While the patch :
1) Has a less number of process memory loads ( p = p->next_run ) given by
the fact
    that does not linear scan RQ, and that have "typically" 1 task / cluster
2) The "distance" of loads it makes to traverse clusters is 8 ( two
pointers ), so
    a single cache load can store more than one cluster ( depending on
architecture ).
    More again, typically a single cluster is accessed.
So if You optimize a cache miss with RQ < 1 You don't get, due to the low
switch / sec,
a relevant improvement.
If You want to give the cache miss optimization a relevant weight, You must
shift to
higher switch / sec, that are given by higher RQ, that will make You loosing
the
cache miss gain due to the linear scan.
</UNDERLINE>
The data cache cost of the patch with RQ < "Cluster scheduler boot point" is
a variabile
onto the stack ( 4 bytes ), that thinking on about, I can even remove.
The code cache cost of the patch with RQ < "Cluster scheduler boot point" is
0,
due to the fact that the code is the same of the previous scheduler.
There is the block of code of the cluster scheduler that can be moved out of
fast path,
but I think that It'll be better to keep it on fast path since we need it
faster under
high workloads not with RQ < 2.
But all of this topics would be clear if that guys that shoot over my patch
cache misses,
would have readed it.
[New coding]
I've moved some code to better optimize branch prediction ( with RQ <
boot_limit ),
and more important I've found a constant redundant loop ( with RQ >
boot_limit ) that
in SMP ( and only in SMP version ) makes the patch have longer times than
the patch
itself can give.
PS:
Tonight I'll try :
for size in 0 2 4 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32
do lat_ctx -s $size 2 2 2 2 2 2
done
but I think to get the same results given the low cache overhead,
and the high noise figure that lat_ctx have when we've to measure
so closer performances.
With respect,
Davide.
