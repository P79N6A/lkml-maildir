I have to agree with Kai and Milton Miller on this (bad) naming.
__required and __optional don't generate the corrent connotations
of what is being attempted here.
Milton suggesting spelling __attribute_used__ as __keep or
__needed.  I prefer __attribute_used__, but something like
__mark_as_used__ would be OK too.
And what uses __optional, however it is spelled?
Thanks,
