I'm currently bisecting on two machines (sata_mv and sata_nv).  sata_mv 
suddenly started spewing errors in recent kernels, but kernels from ~48 
hours ago are just fine.  AMD64 sata_nv machine will simply lock up if I 
push it too hard.  Again, reproducible, and kernels from ~48 hours ago 
are fine.
AHCI machine so far seems fine (kernel ~24 hours ago), storage-wise, but 
the hda_intel audio decided to stop working :)
I'm quite happy to test patches, but I never run with DEBUG_PAGEALLOC so 
that shouldn't be causing the problems here.
