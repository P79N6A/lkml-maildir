Now that hugetlbfs is merged, can we remove the hugetlb syscalls? 
 Pretty please?  ;-)
What I've heard in the background is that all the Big Users(tm) of 
hugetlbs greatly prefer the existing syscalls (a.k.a. hugetlbfs) to 
adding support to new ones in the various userland portability layers in 
use...
