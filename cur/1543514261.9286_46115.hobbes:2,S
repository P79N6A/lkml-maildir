Hi,
	I'm new to linux and am currently in the process of trying to
	understand the kernel source (file system code specifically). i have the
	following question, the VFS inode structure has a union (shown below)
	that is a union of the "private data" of all those file systems that are
	currently supported on linux. Is there any specific reason why this
	union is maintained within the inode structure itself. i mean the
	structure is kind of not-specific to any particular file system and is
	also defined as part of the VFS layer on linux.
	---------------------------------------------
	struct inode {
		........
	    union {
		struct pipe_inode_info   pipe_i;
		struct minix_inode_info  minix_i;
		struct ext_inode_info    ext_i;
		struct ext2_inode_info   ext2_i;
		struct hpfs_inode_info   hpfs_i;
		struct msdos_inode_info  msdos_i;
		struct umsdos_inode_info umsdos_i;
		struct iso_inode_info    isofs_i;
		struct nfs_inode_info    nfs_i;
		struct xiafs_inode_info  xiafs_i;
		struct sysv_inode_info   sysv_i;
		struct affs_inode_info   affs_i;
		struct ufs_inode_info    ufs_i;
		struct socket            socket_i;
		void                     *generic_ip;
	    } u;
	}
	---------------------------------------------
	Being thus generic why is the file system specific data kept within 
	this structure ?? Would it not be better to instead keep a pointer in
	the inode structure, that is made to point to file system specific data
	by respective file systems when a VFS inode is initialized for a file
	system object (on a initial lookup of a file for example).
	Possibly that way the size of the VFS inode structure would be less
	(and consequently less space used overall by any VFS inodes allocated
	in the system) than what it is today and file system specific inode data
	would be created and destroyed as needed by individual file systems. It
	also avoids having to update the VFS inode structure each time a new
	filesystem is supported on linux.
	Any clarification on the above will be most helpful. Please reply to
	this email as i'm not subscribed to this list.
