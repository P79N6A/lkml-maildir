The history of Linux shows that auto-tuning while not always perfect
is much more effective than manual tuning.  How are you envisioning
using this information? 
I find it really easy to see how topology information can be used
to manually tune a system.  I don't currently see how it can be used
to automatically tune a system.
My fear is that we will end up making things brittle with user space
over specifying things.
I have another related concern about what rules need to be in place
so I can upgrade the kernel vdso while a user space program is running.
That make me seriously wonder how sane the vdso concept is, but that
is a completely different issue.
