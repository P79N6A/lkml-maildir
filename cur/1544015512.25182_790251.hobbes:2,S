I've built two custom .deb packages for kernels:
- 2.6.28
- 2.6.27.10
The reason why I built the second one is due to this:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=123074869611409&w=4
It scared me a bit!
Now the dilemma is: which kernel to choose? 2.6.28 should be better but if
the former bug report is confirmed....... Kernel 2.6.28 have several r8169
patches merged; this could be good... or not... who knows... In the other
side, 2.6.27.10 is perhaps newer enough, and it's reported to work ok
(well, not exactly: former bug report said "r8169 worked fine in 2.6.27.8",
and since there are no changes in r8169 from 2.6.27.7 to 2.6.27.10, it
should be safe).
I'll probably go for 2.6.27.10. If you think I'm not right, please, correct
me :-)

If I have to go towards the PITA of maintaining my own .deb kernel package
I prefer to use latest kernels (2.6.18 is pretty older) so at least I'll
have the benefits of better hardware support (drivers) and (hopefully) more
fixes applied :)

Yes, but Debian has also reasons to keep doing this so "stable" release
continues being called "stable" :-) Anyway, I don't want to enter a
flamewar here.
I'll try to install one of the new kernels tomorrow evening...
