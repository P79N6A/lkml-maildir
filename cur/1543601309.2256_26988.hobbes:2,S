Hello,
I tried my usual test setup today with 2.4.10-pre10 and experienced the
following:
- cpu load goes pretty high (11-12 according to xosview)during several
occasions, upto the point where you cannot even move the mouse. Compared to an
once tested ac-version it is not _that_ nice. I have some problems cat'ing
/proc/meminfo, too. I takes sometimes pretty long (minutes).
- the meminfo shows me great difference to former versions in the balancing of
inact_dirty and active. This pre10 tends to have a _lot_ more inact_dirty pages
than active (compared to pre9 and before) in my test. I guess this is intended
by this (used-once) patch. So take this as a hint, that your work performs as
expected.
- of course the alloc problems itself stayed the same.
Regards,
Stephan
