You may wish to take this up with Peter. As I've made very clear right
from the start, I only have access to the 0.4 version of e2comp, so
will NOT be doing anything concerned with the 0.3 version. If somebody
wishes to write a tool to convert between the two, there's no point in
asking me as I've no information with which to help them.
Best wishes from Riley.
