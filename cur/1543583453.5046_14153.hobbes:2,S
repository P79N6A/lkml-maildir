No. 
The "tail conversion" fix was sent to Alan.
It is already included into 2.4.2-ac6.
All fixes are in one combined patch:
ftp://ftp.namesys.com/pub/reiserfs-for-2.4/linux-2.4.2-reiserfs-20010301-full.patch.gz
Tail conversion fix is available as separate patch at namesys.com ftp site:
ftp://ftp.namesys.com/pub/reiserfs-for-2.4/another-null.diff
