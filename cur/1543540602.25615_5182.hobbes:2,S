No, it didn't fix it. I'm still getting "eth0: card reports no resources"
from my Intel express card and then system hang when I ran SPEC SFS with
high IOPS request rate, like 4000 IOPS. Is this guess not tight enough? It
seems that the number needs to be calculated based on the processor speed
and the underlying disk subsystem speed, and the total amount of memory...
Ying
The attached patch should alleviate the situation quite a
lot. It guesstimates that 1/3rd of the cache is "freeable"
and old data and takes only that amount into account. The
30% should be about right in heavy write situations because
if we never fill that much cache memory with our writes there
would be no need to do write throttling.
regards,
Rik
