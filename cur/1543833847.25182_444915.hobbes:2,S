What exactly is it that you want? Limit an RT process, but not limit
it???

If I need something that requires RT I simply set it to be RT.  That is
not what you are asking.  You want something to be RT but limited.  This
_is_ a rare case AFAIC.

People want their RT apps to have a CPU limit?

It could just be me. I'm not into audio, and the RT apps that I use are
in a controlled environment.  So please educate me and tell me what
exactly is it that you want and why?  And not just a buggy RT app that
takes down the system.  That is expected behavior.  And it is possible
to control that in user space.
