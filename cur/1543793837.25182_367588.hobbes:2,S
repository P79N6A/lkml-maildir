I'd say that _usually_ you're better off using chroot() than mounting over 
"/".

Yes. Literally. Everything else stays the same, including any open files 
(and cwd).
It's a "flaw" in chroot if you consider it a jail, but it's used for so 
much more than that.  In fact, you shouldn't consider it jail: it's really 
just a small _part_ of the notion of limiting somebody to a specific area.
(The smallest part, in fact. And you should be aware that root can always 
get out of a chdir() if he just has enough tools - and the tools aren't 
even very big. "mknod" + "mount" will do it even in the absense of a way 
to add binaries, as will /proc access).
Note that the most common use of chroot isn't actually the "jail" kind of 
usage, but building and installation environments (ie a lot of package 
building stuff end up using chroot as a way to create the "target 
environment").

Indeed. The issue ends up being ".." and "getcwd()", which both want to 
know what your root is in order to know where to stop.
