Thats bacause the kabi subdir is broken by design.
Any approach that does not take into account the existing userbase is
broken by design and should be avoided.
The only sensible solution is to move out the kernel internal headers
from include/* to somewhere else.
And then slowly but steady let include/linux and include/asm-* be the
KABI.
In this way we avoid breaking a lot of current users. And new users will
continue to just work.
