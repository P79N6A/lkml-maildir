Hi Riley,

I did compile a LOT (over 2000) of more or less random configurations for the
2.2.14 kernel. I also fixed all but 3 problems. Sergey Kubushin is just trying
to be an ass because he quotes me wrongly. I wrote on l-k that all _BUT THREE_
configurations were supposed to work. I even named all three of the problem 
cases. Now, in the same thread, he puts the words in my mouth as if I said 
that 100% would compile, and gives one of the exceptions I gave him as proof 
that I am a liar.  
That doesn't mean I like the hfmodem-bug (or the other two bugs), it just
means that the right fix just isn't found yet. Before I take Sergey serious
again, I expect him to send Alan a decent fix for the hfmodem problem....
