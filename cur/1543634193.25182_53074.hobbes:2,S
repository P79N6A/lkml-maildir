Well the problem seems to be an inconsistancy I reported to 'the list'
some time ago. As I recall, Ingo replied that I should use usleep(0) and
the problem I reported would "go away". It did go away. However, if
you run this on a single-processor machine, 'top' will show that
each task gets 99+ percent of the CPU, which of course can't be correct.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main(int c, char *argv[])
{
    if(!fork())
    {
        strcpy(argv[0], "Child");
        for(;;)
            ;
    } 
    strcpy(argv[0], "Parent");
    for(;;)
        sched_yield();
   return c;
}
So, it seems that the guy that's yielding the CPU gets 'charged' for
the CPU time he gave away. Fair enough, I guess. As I see it,
sched_yield() will give the CPU to any single computible task once.
After this, the caller gets the CPU back whether or not he wants it.

No. I did not mention or imply "equivalent", only that you can use it
instead, in many, perhaps most, instances.
