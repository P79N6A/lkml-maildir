More testing done to find the breaking point. Running the folding client and 
blender:
2.6.8.1-bk2 is the last kernel without _any_ swapping problem (no screen freezes 
etc)

| 2.6.9-rc1 and three -bk forward have oopses and loss of keyboard in X. 
Can't test them.

2.6.9-rc1-bk4 is the first functional kernel where the freezes show up.
So it is a real regression.
