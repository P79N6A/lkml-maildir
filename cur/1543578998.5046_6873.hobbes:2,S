Venkatesh,
It has been partially addressed in the new lk 2.4 series with
the "scsihosts" parameter. Here is a line from /etc/lilo.conf
in my system:
       append="scsihosts=imm:advansys:advansys:aha1542"
The scsi host numbers will be allocated to the HBAs in 
the order shown starting at 0. This method does not
distinguish between the two advansys controllers, luckily
swapping their positions on the PCI bus does.
In my experience, changing the SCSI BIOS settings only
affects which disk's boot track is accessed to find
the kernel image. It is the kernel's initialization that
detects and orders scsi controllers. This is were
"scsihosts" helps.
