Indeed I don't want or need HIDBP with full HID, which is the reason I said
"so this might not matter".  Also I don't know if anyone still needs HIDBP
or not, which is the reason I said "I have memories of needing HIDBP a few
years ago".
Surely if anyone does still need HIDBP then it should be added to gconfig?
Surely if no one needs HIDBP any more then it should be deleted entirely?
Or maybe I'm 75% blind, maybe I it really is in gconfig and I couldn't see
it.  But no one has said that this is the case.
