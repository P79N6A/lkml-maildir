More or less random comments/questions:
1) Is ext2_bread() vs. bread() separation in fs/ext2/* a first step to
that? (I.e. data blocks vs. inode/bitmap/indirect ones)
2) Sometime ago there was a pretty impressive patch excluding large part
of ext2_find_entry() (it caches the offset into dentry and invalidates it
if needed) and I have a code for cyclic lookups in a directory (cheap
hack, but it really speeds the things up for ls -l and friends). Both
would go nicely into this scheme.
3) We ought to switch from (bh+pointer) to (page+pointer) in namei.c.
4) I still think that indirect blocks may go into the page cache - that
would further simplify truncate(). OTOH the method used by BSD (indirect
block covering addresses from n to n+block_size*pointers_per_block gets
an address -n, double indirect block covering the area from n to n+...
gets -n-block_size, triple indirect - -n-2*block size) will be wasteful
for situations when block size is smaller than page.
5) Who works on that? I would try to do the thing, but if there already is
some code I'ld like to look at it, indeed.
