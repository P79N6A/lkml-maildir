Well... only things that care about __FD_SETSIZE :)
    Why can you safely increase the value in Squid then ?
Because it has been tested and works. I assume libc doesn't care is
this value is increased, not sure about other libraries.
Using libc5 and linux 2.1.9x + scts large-fd patch (which got merged
in later kernels), I manged to work with 100K FDs without too many
problems.
The defintion of 'fd_set' changes with __FD_SETSIZE, so anything
makes these kind of assumptions might break.
For example, if you have some code which assumes this is 1024 and you
try to copy a value into a preallocated array of structure it
defined, then it will break.
So will precompiled code such as:
struct cookie {
	int	type;
	fd_set	chocolate_feeds;
	int	cc_count;
}monster;
sort of thing; because fd_set's size will be wrong.
    Yes, but still, why 1024 ?
Because thats what is has been for a very long time, a safe default.
If your application knows better, it can change it.
    No, squid takes the lowest of both (FD_SETSIZE and SQUID_MAXFD)
    in main.c.  And the Squid configure gets the FD_SETSIZE value
    from linux/posix_types.h ;(
Really? I though for the last couple of years squid would use poll
over select anyhow?
    
    I'm still not convinced that something might break, since everybody
    advices to increase __FD_SETSIZE before compiling Squid.
So do it then.
    
    And if linux/posix_types.h defines the limit of open file
    descriptors of the system, 1024 is (IMO) a wrong number. But then
    again, nobody bothered to change it...
Because 1024 works everywhere, a large or smaller value might not.
