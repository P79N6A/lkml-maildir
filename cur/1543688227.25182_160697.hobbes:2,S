The kernel spends _very_ little time in the disk elevator actually. The
2.4 elevator can send very suboptimal orderings of requests to the disk
when reads and writes are going to the disk at the same time. That might
be happening here. The VM might also be doing more work if you have other
things in RAM as well, although its unlikely to cause such a big
difference.
