I only first heard about idr in last weeks LWN, I thought they might be
useful.

Yep, we could toss everything in to a structure and only have a pointer
to it from the inode.

We need a timer to wake up any processes blocking on a read() call. The
reason it has to be a timer is because the code paths that get run when
an event is queued are not safe places to wake up blocked processes (But
