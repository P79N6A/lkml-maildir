Most of the time the timeout is a "can't happen" - blk_congestion_wait() is
terminated by completion of writeout.  The timeout is mainly there to
prevent hangs if weird and rare races happen.  Otherwise we'd need lots
more locking.
I don't think we want to be calling it at all if reclaim is working well. 
Something like this.
