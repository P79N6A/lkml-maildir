Subject: [PATCH] Fix computation of SKB size for quota messages

  Hello,
  attached patch fixes computation of buffer size needed for quota netlink
messages. Otherwise we were getting errors on some architectures. Andrew,
please apply. Thanks.

Fix computation of size of skb needed for quota message. We should use
netlink provided functions and not just an ad-hoc number. Also don't
print the return value from nla_put_foo() as it is always -1.
