You use GMail, right? Beside the `Search the Web' button at the top of 
your Inbox, you should see a small link: `Create a filter'. Click it.
In the `Subject' box, write `[patch]'. You can then click `Next step'. 
You can move it to a different folder, star it, apply a label, delete 
it, etc.
Then, repeat for `[patch', to catch things like `[patch 0/12]', and so on.
Hope this helps,
    Arlen.
