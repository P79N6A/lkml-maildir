I'm not talking about kernel headers that have to worry about
eventually being included in user space headers.  Those nearly
all live in include/asm.  I'm talking about the kernel headers
that define how userspace is supposed to interface with
particular kernel drivers or hardware.  Headers such as
linux/cdrom.h and linux/loop.h and linux/fb.h.
