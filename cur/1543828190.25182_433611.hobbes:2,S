When compiling 2.6.17-rc6-mm2 (which contains this patch) my gcc 4.0.3 (Ubuntu 
4.0.3-1ubuntu5) complains about "int len;" being used uninitialized in 
print_vma(). AFAICS len is not initialized and then passed to 
pad_len_spaces(int len), which uses it for some calculations.
I also noticed that similar code is used in fs/proc/task_mmu.c, where 
show_map_internal() passes an uninitialised int len; to pad_len_spaces(struct 
seq_file *m, int len).
