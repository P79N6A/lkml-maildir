You need to think about bus mastering devices as well. With re-ordering
enabled you may confuse bus master hardware by writing fields in the
wrong order (as the PCI device sees it).
This is not a big problem. On the winchip we avoid this by using locked
operations at the end of each of the PCI DMA mapping functions.  I think
all that is needed is to also define CONFIG_X86_OOSTORE for a Geode
target. The kernel will then generate
		lock; addl $0, 0(%%esp)
to force write ordering where it might be essential, and if OOSTORE is
defined we can safely turn on the speed up.
