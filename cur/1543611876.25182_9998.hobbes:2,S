  Arjan> Hi, The patch below (against 2.4.16) makes the ia64 port no

How soon will Jens' patch make it into the official tree?  I think
that would be a pre-requisite before switching to a highmem based
implementation.
Another concern I have is that, fundamentally, I dislike the idea of
penalizing all IA-64 platforms due to one chipset that is, shall we
say, "lacking" (i.e., doesn't have an I/O TLB).
Could someone comment on whether the 870 will have I/O TLB support
(private mail is fine, if you don't feel comfortable sending mail to
all the lists...).
Thanks,
