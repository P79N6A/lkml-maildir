No.  An assignment expression has the value of the value
assigned.  This allows expressions like a = b = c ('=' is
right-associative).  It will be true if the assigned value is
true (nonzero), and false if the assigned value is false (zero).
However, it is generally more clear and less error prone to make
such tests explicit (i.e. (a = b) != 0).
