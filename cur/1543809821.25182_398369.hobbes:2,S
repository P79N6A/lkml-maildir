I have a compaq ra4100 RAID rack mount enclosure with 6 18.2 GB 7200 rpm
drives, a compaq 64-bit pci 66 MHz fibre channel card, and a fibre
channel cable. These work with NT, but sadly are not supported in recent
2.4 kernels (older than 2.4.19 apparently works, but I've not used that
old a kernel) or 2.6 kernel.  The driver that hp made open source is
called cpqfc, but fails to work.
I'd like to support kernel development, and I don't know anything about
driver programming in linux, or the fibre channel protocol, and while I
feel confident I could learn the necessary skills to update the driver
(or preferably split the driver up so the ra4100 could be used with
fibre channel cards other than the compaq one), I have other projects
that are higher priority for me.  Therefore, if you mail me off-list,
and can provide some verifiable bona fides, and indicate that you will
work on making this hardware work with a modern kernel, I will ship the
hardware to you for free (to most of Canada, and continental US; the
beast is *heavy* and that will be expensive enough).
I do require some sort of proof that you're not just planning on taking
the drives.  An email saying 'please send the drives, I will work on a
driver' is therefore insufficient; include references please.
I am not subscribed, so any mail on this subject should be sent directly
to me, or at least cc'd.
Thanks,
Daniel
