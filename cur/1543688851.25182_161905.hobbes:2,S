You're talking about 32-bit sparc, on sparc64 it's a constant
16K.
For sparc 32-bit, just use 4MB, that's the largest possible value.
And you have to check this with uname() results, not with ifdefs
as 32-bit Sparc binaries run on sparc64 systems just fine.
I also would not object at all to a kernel patch that exported the
SHMLBA value via some sysctl value.
