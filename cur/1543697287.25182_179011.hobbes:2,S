akpm wants us not to barf when ->nopage() methods not updated to the
new signature are used, so we're either setting the initial value of
ret in do_no_page() to something that won't get barfed on by
do_page_fault() or teaching all the fault handlers to ignore invalid
return values. As far as fixing the warning, the #ifdef is still needed.
I'm going to ruminate on non-fatal methods of complaining loudly.
