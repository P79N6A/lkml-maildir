Perhaps, but why did it occur? S.m.a.r.t. doesn't tell me anything suspicious.

Yup. I fscked it after reboot and fixed them all...
[went to gather some info from e2fsprogs sources what kind of errors it was (I 
didn't note it and can't remember)]
block differences, incorrect block counts, orphaned entries, some (gnome-vfs2 
stuff which has been updated) went to lost+found.
I unfotunately can't post more accurate info, because I am a... chump? Bite me 
and shame on me...
