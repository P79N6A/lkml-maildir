Sorry, I thought I saw a + somewhere there at the beggining of the line,
my fault.

Why do you need the classdevice?  I'm really not too eager about adding
tons of new misdevices now that we can route directly to individual majors
with cdev_add & stuff.  Especially when you're actually relying on class
device you should have your own one instead of relying on an onsolete
layer.

They're bound to use distro kernels unfortunaly..  These people is anyone
doing big-scale fileserving at least.

Arguments two and three are still redudant.
Actually, you fixed that in read_write.c, just compat.c is still missing.
Looks like you forget to fix that one and didn't have a chance to compile-test
the 32bit compat layer?
