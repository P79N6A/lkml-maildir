Can you provide me
1.	The lspci -v info for your box (chip revision etc)
2.	Details ont he updated windows drivers (eg URL for)
3.	The USB devices

Directly, I don't believe so. However they do provide contact points for
some of us and have provided workarounds for other bugs. We now have a 
mechanism in place for making such requests.
Firstly however I'd like the USB folks to look at the debug and traces to be
sure this isnt a VIA chip bug. If it is I'll take it up with VIA
