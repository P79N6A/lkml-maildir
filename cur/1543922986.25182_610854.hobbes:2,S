For x86-only code it's not really a problem - i.e. if we pull it into
uml build at all, checks for BITS_PER_LONG/__i386__/CONFIG_64BIT/etc.
are all the same.  For arch-dependent drivers... we have very good
reasons not pull them into uml builds anyway.  And arch-independent
code shouldn't care at all, so we are left with random bits of arch-dependent
code ifdefed in generic one _and_ not handled via asm/*.h.  I.e. with very
few odd cases - it's not that we wanted to add and keep such places anyway,
uml or no uml.
I'd say that raid6 is the only legitimate current case and even that is
somewhat dubious - we might e.g. not bother with x86-only parts of
raid456-objs on other targets and handle that on Kconfig/Makefile level.
