Agreed. IIRC my toshiba PDAs *dont* provide a delay. OTOH they also 
provide *two* ways of detecting card presence...

Well I *know* I never saw the specs from the SD forum. I hacve never 
reverse engineered a SDHC core driver either (I have reverse engineered 
a chip driver but it contained no SD *protocol* information.
as such my code should be 100% safe to commit to the kernel.
PS. Richard - I am here - hope you receive this!
