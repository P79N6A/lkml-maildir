They do, but I could never find them.  At least, not that made sense to me.  
The mvSata_Linux drivers were the GPL'ed, and then "extended" versions, IIRC.  
It's been a while since I've researched that.

I do too.  However, I was trying to use a Supermicro P4SCi motherboard and it 
*would not boot* with two SX8 cards and more than 8 SATA drives hooked up, 
regardless of configuration (7 on one card, 2 on the other, etc). So, I had 
to find another eight port card.  And besides, the MV8's are about half the 
price of the SX8's. :)  So I went with what worked.
