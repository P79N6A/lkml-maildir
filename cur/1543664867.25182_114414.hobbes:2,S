I would think that SWAP would belong with PREEMPT, since they are both
global characteristics of the o/s. Those who care can argue where that
should be.
I could believe that SMP would belong in the same place, since it's a
global option not specific to a single architecture. Any of these could be
greyed out or undisplayed for the few architechtures which don't support
them.
There are arguably others.
