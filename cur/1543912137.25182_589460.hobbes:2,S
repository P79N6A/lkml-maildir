I do not have platform. => cat /sys/power/disk
test testproc [shutdown] reboot 
Now are 14 days gone and my uptime is 14 days.
Many suspend/resume cycles were made (is there any counter you could see

I tried everything with 2.6.23-rc3 to reproduce this but I could not. I 
will reboot in to 2.6.23-rc4 now.
