Subject: get_empty_filp() is not SMP safe. [f_version problem]

I noticed that get_empty_filp() is not smpsafe:
    the line "f->f_version = ++event" can race.
Actually, it seems that f_version is completely broken:
* it's only read during read_dir.
* it's only set in get_empty_filp() and during file read/write operations,
ie. it seems that for directories, it is never updated.
I think it can be completely removed, because i_sem prevents parallel
accesses.
Additionally, I noticed several minor points:
* sys_pread()/sys_pwrite(), sys_readv()/sys_writev()
    acquire the kernel lock, but they don't need it.
* [sparc64] has special versions of sys32_readv etc. in
    sys_sparc32.c. They still contain the "old", i.e.
    lock_kernel() synchonization. This should be changed
    before 2.4
* mandantory file locks must be synchonized with pending
    read/write calls.
* if f_version is removed, then sys_lseek() with default_lseek()
    doesn't need the big kernel lock.
I've attached an [untested] patch which removes the superflous lock_kernel()
calls.
Btw, drivers/char/tty_io.c currently calls down(inode->i_sem) during
do_tty_write(). If you acquire i_sem in sys_write(), then you must delete
this line [should avoid one reboot :>)
