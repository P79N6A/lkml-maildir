I also had this problem.  Ended up using the nopage entry point
to map the pages.  Works fine on 2.0 and 2.2 kernels.
eg:
    mmap:
        calls get_free_page() repeatedly (my dma engine does not
           need contiguous physmem: hurray!) saving the addresses
        return 0
    nopage:
        looks up the appropriate page in my saved info
        returns phys addr of that page        
I think I got this technique from Rubini's book
