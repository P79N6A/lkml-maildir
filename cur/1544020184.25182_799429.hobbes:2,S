Hmm, I thought about using the parent-child relationship and fairly normal
wait() semantics, but this looks simpler.

Mildly prefer bool in new code.

This needs a comment.  Especially since to_xxx(yyy) is usually simply a
container_of(yyy, xxx, member).  This one is special.

I don't think this works.  How does do_exit() preserve a stack var, other
than for a few cycles longer?  Sure, the vfork_done will be OK, but this code
here will not be.  I think you'd need a get_task_struct(current) before the
do_exit(ret) (the case where the kthread fn calls do_exit() is fine: you're
not allowed to call kthread stop on such threads).
In which case using vfork_done is really just a convenience pointer inside
struct task_struct to stash the struct kthread.  And that's horribly ugly, which is why I stuck with a simple global.  Changing to a linked-list of things to stop would avoid the deadlock you mentioned where a kthread stops another kthread.
Thanks,
Rusty.
