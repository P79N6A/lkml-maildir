That's impractical -- you would need to patch the process or call
it from a special program, which is not nice.
rlimits are useful to set a limit during log in. For that the
children can be all kinds of different processes and possibly use
different settings.

You set the classes once per rlimit (e.g. in a pam module)
Then the processes set different scheduling priorities by themselves
(standard programs do that). Then that priority would map to a different
class.
