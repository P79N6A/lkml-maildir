Ok, after some testing I have a test case that hits a severe starvation case.
I have the courier-imap server running on my box, and when mozilla gets
messages with junk filtering turned on, it has to download each message to
scan it, almost all of the processing is in mozilla, and the mouse is smooth
as you'd see on windows, but I can't get anything else to run.
My kde taskbar won't switch desktops, though gkrellm keeps running smoothly
reporting 100% processor usage.
I'm not using sound on this machine ATM, so I have nothing to say about
XMMS...
