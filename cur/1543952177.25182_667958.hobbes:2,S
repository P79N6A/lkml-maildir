[Adding Bryce to cc list, he may have a copy of intel_reg_dumper already built 
for Ubuntu.  Bryce, please see below for a few more questions, thanks.]

This usually means you don't have the xorg autoconf macros installed.  Your 
distro probably has some sort of xserver-devel package that may include it.

No problem, building X still isn't quite as easy as it should be, but it's 
only slightly more complicated than the typical './configure;make;make 
install' due to the dependencies between packages.  You can check out the X 
wiki (wiki.x.org), there are some hints on building things there.

Hm, I haven't looked at the Ubuntu scripts before.  I know they're using 
upstart, but if they haven't divered too much from the old style init, you 
may be able to modify rc.sysinit to get the boot time register dump.
For the splash screen dump, you'd just have to add the intel_reg_dumper 
command to one of the other init scripts that runs while the splash screen is 
up (maybe the HAL daemon script or something).
Once your screen is blank, it's probably easiest to ssh into your machine and 
capture the dump that way.
Hope that helps, maybe Bryce can give you some more hints on Ubuntu specifics.

Probably, though the messages in your log from your Univ. connection may be 
enough for the networking guys to figure things out.  It's probably best to 
track the wireless thing as a separate issue though, I'd recommend mailing 
linux-wireless@vger.kernel.org with the problem.
Thanks,
