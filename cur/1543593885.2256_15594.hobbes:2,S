Dear Linus, Alan and Jeff,
thank you very much for your replies. I though it is
best, if I respond with one email so we have all in one
place.

dump_irq returns the following:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
No PCI interrupt routing table was found.
Interrupt router at 00:07.0: AcerLabs Aladdin M1533
PCI-to-ISA bridge
  INT1 (link 1): irq 11
  INT2 (link 2): unrouted
  INT3 (link 3): unrouted
  INT4 (link 4): unrouted
  INT5 (link 5): unrouted
  INT6 (link 6): unrouted
  INT7 (link 7): unrouted
  INT8 (link 8): unrouted
  Serial IRQ: [enabled] [continuous] [frame=21]
[pulse=8]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The output of lspci -vvvxx is a bit longer, so I
have put it in:
http://launchers.tripod.com/linux/lspci_vvvxx.txt

Yes, I tried 'pci=biosirq' as well as
'pci=irqmask=0xfff8', but unfortunately I couldn't see
any change.

The putput of lspci -vvvxxx is in:
http://launchers.tripod.com/linux/lspci_vvvxxx.txt

OK, I recompiled the kernel with this change and the
output of 'dmesg' is in 
http://launchers.tripod.com/linux/dmesg.wDEBUG1.txt
Hope this helps to trace back my problem!
Thank you very much again for your help!
