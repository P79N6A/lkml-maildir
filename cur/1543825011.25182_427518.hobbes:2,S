We would have to patch if we knew that disabling was required. But these
drivers that do not call pci_disable_device (for instance tg3 and bnx2)
were already working before pci_save_msi_state was added by Shaohua in
2.6.17-rc:
http://kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=41017f0cac925e4a6bcf3359b75e5538112d4216
So they were working without any PCI core function disabling MSI for
them during suspend.
For these drivers, it might be a regression against 2.6.17-rc, but not
against 2.6.16. I'd say it's fine.
