I'm unsure if it's a good idea it's broken only on broken HW, people
wanting stable box try to buy sane HW and don't enable CONFIG_BROKEN
so they will never see if their HW are starting to be out of spec.
Perhaps rewording the option help and the error message to say it's
known to report false positive...
