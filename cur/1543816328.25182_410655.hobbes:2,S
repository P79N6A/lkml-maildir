I seem to recall that the Stanford Metacompilation group (Dawson Engler)
already wrote such a tool.  Not sure what sort of access there is for the
tool, whether public funding would grant access to the public, or if they
are at least willing to make an online interface available (the group has
spun out into "Coverity", and it seems unlikely it will be completely OSS).
Cheers, Andreas
