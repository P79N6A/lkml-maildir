Is there some way to tell the NTP code how much the time_interpolator time 
deviates from xtime?
If the NTP code would use getnstimeofday or 
do_gettimeofday then it would already get interpolated time.
The curious issue in the current arrangement is that the interpolator 
knows much more accurately how much time has passed between interrupts 
than the timer interrupt but it has no time to make that information 
available to the NTP code.
