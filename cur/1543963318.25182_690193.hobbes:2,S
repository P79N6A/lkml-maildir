Yeah, but making the caller need to know about the internal 
implementation details of the callee (ie, whether it needs to allocate 
memory or not) leads to pretty warty interfaces.  In this case, you 
could push the gfp_t up to the call_usermodehelper_setup() level, but 
pushing it any higher wouldn't make much sense.
Not that I have a better answer.
