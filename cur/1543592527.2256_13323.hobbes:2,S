It is very easy for me to see any leak which I can trigger.  I'm using
a tool which tracks each any every allocation in the kernel. (a 1/32
scale model of physical memory with 'who allocated it, and when' tags)

Exactly.  Nothing but ram and it's mostly unfreeable.  That makes
life pretty tough for the vm.
Does it hang if you are doing other things than creating/destroying
tiny files (with unique names) as rapidly as possible?.. ie did you
start doing that to troubleshoot because it was hanging over a long
period of time?
You snipped my suggestion.. did you try it?  If not, please do.  In
fact, go a bit further.  Make unconditional calls to kmem_cache_reap()
and shrink_icache_memory() as well.. prior to calling page_launder().
It's a long shot, but it might help.  If it does help, that will
tell developers what they need to know.  It costs you five minutes.
Another option is to build 2.4.5-pre6 and add the patch Rik posted.
If my thinker is working right, that _will_ help (if not cure).
Another option which virtually guarantees successful identification
of the problem (but costs more than five minutes) is for you to grab
a copy of IKD from your favorite kernel mirror and give memleak a try
locally.  It can be found in /pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/ikd. If
you choose this option and have any trouble, drop me a note offline.
