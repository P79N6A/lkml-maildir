According to the specifications, vmalloc is limited only by the amount of
physical memory on your machine.  However, Arjan VanDeVen has a point.
Other process are already using physical memory (like the kernel process),
and those process count against the physical memory available.
TIP: It's always nice to leave at least 20% of the physical memory free for
other critical processes, especially those that can't be swapped out.
