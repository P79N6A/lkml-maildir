Just to clarify, LKCD is NOT block based dumping, OR net based
dumping, or anything.  It's an infrastructure for dumping that
lets you, the user, the distributor, the customer, whatever,
make the decision for what's right for you.  Yes, we provide
disk based dumping now, and are including the net dump code
very soon, as well as some of these other smaller dump methods.
Has ANYONE other than Christoph and Stephen H. done a full review of
the LKCD patch set before commenting?  Or are people just making
this stuff up as they go along?  A ton of things have changed
over the past year just because people complained about only doing
disk dumping.  And then to hear this ...

Please read the patches and decide again.  If you want the latest
net dump patch, let me know.
