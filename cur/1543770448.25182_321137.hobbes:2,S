been there, done that. A couple of years ago i started out with a 
somewhat similar opinion to yours, which could be summed up as: "this 
cannot be that hard, just break up the code, damnit". Wrote tools to see 
where the latencies come from, and started sticking cond_resched()s in.  
A few years down the road and after multiple restarts (lowlatency patch, 
the first preempt prototype patch, -VP patchset, etc.) i ended up with 
the -RT patch and with two new preemption models (PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY and 
PREEMPT_RT) in addition to PREEMPT_NONE and PREEMPT. (With the extra 
twist that when i started then the kernel was only 2 million lines big, 
now it's 6+ million lines of code.)
