They are class devices called ttyS0, ttyS1, ttyS2 so you can say
they're uniquely named.
The problem is that Matthew wants to add a symlink from the device
device to the class device to complement the class device to device
symlink, since we end up with multiple symlinks in the devices subdir
all called the same.
This causes serial a problem because we have multiple class devices
per device.
