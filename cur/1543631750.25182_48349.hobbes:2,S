Well you suspected wrong. And even before you made that statement
several developers explained that they make money in a other way than
via RTAI, and others like myself told you they just code RTAI in their
spare time. So the statement is pure FUD, especialy since the whole RTAI
sources are available on the website, and helll you can even follow
every little change in the CVS, no critical chunks missing.

When things don't apply to one self in person it doesn't mean you should
not care about them. RTAI is free software under the GPL, but that does
not mean we want to force the users of RTAI to also use the GPL, and
with the binary module exception of the kernel and the LXRT for
userspace we gave them the freedom to choose a license of their own. The
patent takes this freedom away, as patents always take freedoms away.

Maybe you should try it some time, you know what they say about ppl that
dare to admit they are wrong.
