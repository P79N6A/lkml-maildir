That is exactly it.  The relevant section of the debug info is
PCI: Bridge 0000:00:01.0
PCI: Bridge resource 7 00008000-00008fff (%f=100)
PCI: Bridge resource 8 f7d00000-fddfffff (%f=200)
PCI: Bridge resource 9 bdf00000-ddefffff (%f=1201)
The bridge was assigned to a piece of the end of physical memory.
