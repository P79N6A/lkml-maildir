if (detected_new_driver) {
   new_code();
} else {
   old_code();
}
in the userland app.  if structures change in an incompatible way
you need _v1 and _v2 versions of them of course.
And what to use for detected_new_driver?  Probably the new ABI version
ioctl..

Yeah.  And please do like device-mapper with major and minor versions.
major as in completly incompatible and minor as in support old protocol
but has new featues in addition.

Bad idea :)

Doesn't sound like a fit either.  Maybe you could do a small own fs
to control nbd, but I'm not familar enough with the actual API to comment
on this more.
