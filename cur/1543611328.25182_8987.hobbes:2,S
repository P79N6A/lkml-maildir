Hello,
    I haven't seen this posted yet, so here it is..
During a 'make bzImage' for 2.5.1-pre4, I received the following error:
scsi_lib.c: In function 'scsi_io_completion'
scsi_lib.c:585: parse error before 'good_sectors'
..Error 1, in drivers/scsi
The following patch does the trick....missing comma
Regards,
Frank
