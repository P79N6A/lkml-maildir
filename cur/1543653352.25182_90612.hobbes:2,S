hi Alan,
I noticed you recently merged this patch with Marcelo in the
2.4 BK tree (lists you as author, and annotation says it came
from DaveM originally)...

This looks to me like it introduces a memory leak in the new !size
case - either the "size" bump and test needs to be moved before the
"area" kmalloc, or we need to kfree(area) before returning NULL.
If you like, I'll make a (trivial) patch to do one of these?
cheers.
