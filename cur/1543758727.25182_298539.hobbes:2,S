	1) write the data
	2) wait on the data write
	3) write the journal
	4) wait on the journal write
If we were to omit step 2), we wouldn't be ordering data any more: we will
commit the journal while there are still data writes in flight.
However, what you are proposing is, I think,
	1) write the data
	2) write the journal
	3) wait on the data write
	4) wait on the journal write
That would work, and could possibly speed things up a little.
But bear in mind that the journal write is just a single seek, and the
journal tends to be at one end of the disk, and we need to seek to it
anyway.  There would be some opportunity for the elevator and the disk to
optimise away a seek.
