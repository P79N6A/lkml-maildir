Hi Andrew,
s390 patches for 2.6.4. The zfcp patches (#8-#10) are big - too big for
my taste but I lost the argument with our scsi folks. They would like
to see their log message cleaup upstream. I seperated the log message
cleanup (#9 and #10) from the real bug fixes. If its too big just skip
these two.
Short descriptions:
1) s390 architecture fixes. This one clashes with the remap-file-pages
   fix for s390 I sent yesterday but the conflict is easy to fix.
2) Some more common i/o layer fixes.
3) Fix for the last sclp fix.
4) Network driver fixes.
5) Dasd driver fixes.
6) z/VM monitor stream fixes.
7) Tape driver fixes.
8) The real zfcp bug fixes.
9) zfcp host adapter message cleanup part 1.
10) zfcp host adapter message cleanup part 2.
Patches are against -bk dated 12.03.2004.
blue skies,
  Martin.
