Hi All,
I extracted this part of Pavel the patch he had submitted for 2.0.3 and 
appended it to README file. Since Pavel has't noticed it, I am assuming that 
most people won't notice it either.
Do people think pushing documentation into Documentation/kgdb directory is a 
better idea?
Another note about kgdb documentation - 
There is a lot of documentation at kgdb.sourceforge.net. It's more of howto 
type rather than manpages. Will it be too much as a documentation in kernel 
sources.
Any ideas on which things to put into Documentation/kgdb and which to have on 
a website.
