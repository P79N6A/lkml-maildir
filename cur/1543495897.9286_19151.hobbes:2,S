Until now, I have never gotten a single message with an X-UIDL header that
was not spam. The common spamming software that people use that adds a
bunch of bogus headers also always adds an X-UIDL header for some reason.
I suspect that this is because the authors know little about email and
simply inspected the email that they downloaded from their ISP as an
example of how to construct headers.
I have modified my filtering rules for kernel list mail to get around this
particular check.  BTW, I do not reject such mail, I simply freeze it
until I can inspect it.
