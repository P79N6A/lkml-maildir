I have question about curent form of udev source.
First: is it any real reason for use by udev private copy libsysfs which
is statically linked with udev ?
I'm using udev with shared libsysfs for a months and all works correcly.
If no reasons patches for using system avalaible libsysfs for udev 048 
can be downloaded from:
http://cvs.pld.org.pl/SOURCES/udev-uses_system_libsysfs.patch?rev=1.7
http://cvs.pld.org.pl/SOURCES/udev-extras_scsi_id_sysfs.patch?rev=1.1
Also after aplying this patches libsysfs/ subdirectory can be removed from 
udev source tree.
Second: in current udev Makefile is used direct stripping linked binaries.
Why ? It makes harder packaging udev if someone will try generate udev in 
for example rpm form with debug info in separated udev-debug package.
Patch for remove stripping:
http://cvs.pld.org.pl/SOURCES/udev-no_strip.patch?rev=1.7
After aplying this patch pereviouse behavior can be obtained by:
% make LDFLAGS="-s"
