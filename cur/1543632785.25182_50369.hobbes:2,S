Are you sure the head can move that far out on the disk?  What you are doing
is far beyond any CD-ROM specs.

That is referring to the "sendcmd" (i.e. the OS did not have a problem
executing the request, the drive idicated a fault.)

The sense data cannot be any more to the point.
Check with the drive manufacturer to see if it can write off the edge of the
disk. (It's rumored some plextor drives are able to continue writing off the
end of the disk into the air :-)  Somehow I doubt the last bit, but all of
mine have continued writing as long as they have a surface on which to
focus the laser.)
