Subject: d_add on negative dentry?

Is it valid to call d_add on a negative dentry?
(or on a dentry that is already linked in d_hash, but all negative
 dentries are, right?)
I'm guessing it isn't because I think that is how I can get my machine to
hang in d_lookup, looping on a corrupt d_hash list.
The problem can be reproduced like this. /mnt/smb is a smbfs mount of
/mnt/samba/export from a samba server on localhost.
/mnt/smb% ls
aa
/mnt/smb% rm aa
/mnt/smb% touch /mnt/samba/export/aa
/mnt/smb% ls
ls: aa: No such file or directory
And shortly after it will lock up completely.
My printk's tell me that a negative dentry is still hashed since d_hash is
non-empty. d_add calls d_instantiate and d_rehash, the later adds it to a
d_hash list without first removing it. But it was already linked so now 2
extra dentries are also pointing to this dentry. And it is then no longer
a list ...
The attached patch fixes things for me. Comments?
Oh, and I *think* ncpfs has the same problem. But that's just from reading
the code.
