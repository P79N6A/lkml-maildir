Subject: Kernel 2.4.2 command execution hangs and then succeded after 2 minutes....!?

Hi, I've compiled and installd 2.4.2 on a my self-made linux distribution
based on glibc-2.0 and a strange thing happens. When I invoke some
binaries (for examples mc,pine,tar) for at least 2 minutes nothing
happens, the execution appaerntly hangs but then the command start as
normal. This happens only with a few set of commands that apparently have
nothing in common, they are linked against the same libraries of many
other commands that are working. I don't know what to think, I've used a
kernel compiled on an other machine (that is known to build correctly 
2.4.x kernels) but the problem remains so it is not my gcc-2.95 fault.
Does anyone has some ideas?
Bye
