I already found the function in glibc and it looks as if it would be rather 
easy to do it there. I only hope the glibc maintainers will accept this kind 
of fixes (hope they won't say that nobody needs this).
Cheers,

PS: Also many thanks for fixing other bugs in the NFS client. Until 2.6.9 init 
somehow could not open /dev/console on a readonly mountpoint. With 2.6.11 
this problem has disappeared, thanks a lot for fixing this and other 
problems. I never had the time to write a bugreport for that.
