I've read tuning tips wrt Oracle on Linux.  Most say to increase SHMMAX and the
semaphores.  I ask you this, what _real_ difference does it make?  Am I going
to be able to see the difference on a VA3500 (quad pent III 550,512M RAM)?  I'd
much rather use a stock kernel, but I'll hack for the good of my users.
