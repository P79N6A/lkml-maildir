If a different compiler version is known to break (and Keith says he has
seen that in practice, and I can see it happen as well given that a few
kernel headers depend on compiler version), the vendor in question is better
off being informed about the incompatibility. He _already_ has to have an
exact match on the kernel version and the other symbols, so adding the
compiler to that is not an extra burden, just a "oh we goofed" prevention..
