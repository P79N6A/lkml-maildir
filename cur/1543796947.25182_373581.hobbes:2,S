Did I say that. No, I said it would be desirable to provide a working 
config with the kernel, to which something could be symlinked. This no 
more "forces" distributions to do anything than LSB. It would provide a 
default, it would provide something working, and if I didn't like it I 
could change it. But I wouldn't have to try and change thing way up in 
initrd so I can boot one kernel or another...

We have standard libraries, header files, system calls, why is a 
standard in this case a bad thing? Actually not even a standard, 
perhaps, a default. It wouldn't make it one bit harder to have custom 
names, for those who believe different is better.
