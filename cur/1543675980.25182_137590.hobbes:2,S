Sorry I didn't see this sooner, I'm unsubscribed for the moment until my
email provider can get exim/procmail talking nicely.
LTP has had a mailing list for a long time that is explicitly for the
purpose of posting results.  It's currently underutilized so I'd love to
see more results getting posted there again.  Please consider using that
one for posting results of all types (LTP and non-ltp)
ltp-results@lists.sourceforge.net
Thanks,
Paul Larson
