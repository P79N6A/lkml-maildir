FWIW, I've had a RAID0 partion, doing UseNet, for the past year. No problems
found to date. It's  pair of 2GB SCSI-W on an adaptec AHA290x controller.
The kernel is v2.0.37. I have had problems in the past where the disk was
flakey (but not completely dead) and the RAID stuff didn't help me much in
detremining that. In those cases, I had to remount the disk, outside of the
RAID environment, and run single-disk diagnostics. In one extreme case, only
black-box replacement of the drive yielded the fact that it was the drive
(process of elimination). I RMA'd the drive and everything has been working
fine since. I could not have diagnosed the problem had I not had spare
machines and extra hard drives to compare against.
There are many cases where swap-n-pray is the ONLY diagnostic mechanism that
works (unless you have extensive hardware testing facilities, of course).
The lesson is, the problem's not always software.
