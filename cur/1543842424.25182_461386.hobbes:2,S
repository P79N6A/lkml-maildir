But that is not a problem.
If attacker already has priviledge foo, he can just go use it. He does
not have to exec() poor program not expecting to get priviledge foo,
then abusing it.
...actually...
...what you say is a problem. You are right that capabilities should
be "sanitized" on every exec of suid/sgid program (not only suid
root).
Sanitized here means "all regular capabilities set, all others
cleared".
