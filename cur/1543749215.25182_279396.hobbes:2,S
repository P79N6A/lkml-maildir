Yes, interrupts are usually assigned much earlier than they are serviced by
device drivers.

I can work with that approach too :)  I was just concerned with some of the
not so testable legacy drivers.

It depends if we want userspace to handle any resource management policy.
If it doesn't, then more complex PnP algorithms will have to be implemented
in kernel.  Userspace control is more important for old technology where
resource assignment can be less flexable.  Examples would include ISAPnP and
PCMCIA.  The majority of systems could probably get by without userspace
control if we are able to map out tricky things like the 10-bit decode VGA I/O
in kernel.
Pat suggested a resource tree in sysfs with each item in the tree linking back
to the device that consumes it.  Kobject size, and strange locking/lifetime
challenges would be the major disadvantages.  Also a method for making the
actual assignments would have to be worked out.
Another reason userspace would care about this information is that it could be
really useful for debugging hardware problems.

Basically there are three goals:
1.) To solve the resource allocation problems we currently see with ACPI and
other bus/firmware technologies and fullfill their requirements.
2.) To integrate the tracking of bus resources into the driver model--  This
will allow us to more accurately track device dependencies.  Just like there
are power parents/domains in power management, there are resource producers in
resource management.  Also it should allow us to remove a bunch of duplicate 
code between bus drivers.
3.) To support resource rebalancing-- This will likely become necessary as PCI
express gains wider usage because it will allow for more complex PCI bridge
hierarchies.  A device could be paused, and it's resources could be adjusted
to accommodate a newly hotplugged device etc.
I appreciate the comments.
Thanks,
Adam
