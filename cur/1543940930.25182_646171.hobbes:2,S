I of course realise that.  I also realise that swapin_readahead() is
_supposed_ to make the difference moot.
There's something you guys aren't telling us.  Several things, actually. 
Please don't do that.
Implementation-wise: make_pages_present() _can_ be converted to do this. 
But it's a lot of patching, and the result will be a cleaner, faster and
smaller core MM.  Whereas your approach is easy, but adds more code and
leaves the old stuff slow-and-dirty.
Guess which approach is preferred? ;)
