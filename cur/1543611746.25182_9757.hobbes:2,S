I wouldn't say it's not back compatible. If you want to use a new
devfsd feature, then you need the new devfs. The key difference
between the old and new devfs core (aside from fixing those races) is
that the new devfs core will spit out an EEXIST warning message
whereas before it didn't. But his system still worked. It didn't
break.
