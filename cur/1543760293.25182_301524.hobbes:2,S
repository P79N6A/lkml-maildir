I don't see the connection between your comment and the thread sorry.
If I send it all to Andrew what will happen. Andrew can either break it
into zillions of pieces and everyone will say "But why do we need this"
or apply it. You might want to ask why so many new drivers don't bother
using pci_ids.h, I'd venture to say its a defensive mechanism against
broken process.
