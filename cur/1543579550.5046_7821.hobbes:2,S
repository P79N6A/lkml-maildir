If your approach isn't overly intrusive (i.e. doesn't require changes
to all files containing module parameters, or such), maybe you could
make a patch for 2.4.x and wave it a little under Linus' nose. Maybe
he likes the scent ;-)
In any case, once it's in 2.5.x, and if it is as useful as I suspect
it to be, it would probably be back-ported to 2.4 sooner or later.
