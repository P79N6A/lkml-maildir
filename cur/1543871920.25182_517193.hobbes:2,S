This patch is incorrect and shouldn't be merged.

This analysis is correct.  Nothing can clobber -EIOCBQUEUED as it is  
returned up from fs/direct-io.c to fs/aio.c.  This -EIO from  
invalidation is one of the two places that currently break this rule.
The fix I had hoped for, invalidating down in fs/direct-io.c before  
returning -EIOCBQUEUED, doesn't work because it ends up getting the  
ordering between the journal lock and the page lock backwards.   
Sigh.  (note to self: help lockdep warn us about that ordering)

True, but this is gratuitously cruel to external users of - 
EIOCBRETRY.  Silently breaking them doesn't sound like a great plan.   
If we really decide to remove EIOCBRETRY support we'd get rid of all  
the retry infrastructure and remove the EIOCBRETRY errno so their  
builds failed.  That's a separate issue that shouldn't be confused  
with this EIOCBQUEUED clobbering.  Just removing some pieces of the  
infrastructure willy-nilly isn't acceptable.

Me either.  I was waiting for them to arrive before responding.

There are two problems behind this bug:
- ext3_releasepage() returns failure if it races with kjournald  
holding a reference while it waits for a transaction to commit.
- generic_file_direct_IO() causes an oops if it clobbers -EIOCBQUEUED  
with the return code from invalidate_inode_pages2_range()..- 
 >releasepage().
This fix makes the incorrect assertion that *any* failure from  
invalidate_inode_pages2_range(), which might not have anything to do  
with this race you're currently seeing, is transitory and should  
trigger a retry.  That's wrong, it should be returning the error.
Now, getting ext3_releasepage() to not fail if this race hits to  
begin with is another story.  Chris has some ideas about reworking  
the page laundering helper to make that more reliable.
