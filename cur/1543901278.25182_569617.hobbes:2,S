I know that its not typical, but when my current kernel is stable and 
shows the same problem with the cfs-patch applied like the 
git-snapshot, I would say its a cfs issue.
There is nothing in the logs when a program dies, thats why asked for a 
way to make the kernel more verbose.
But I can build a plain 2.6.22 without cfs and one with it and compare 
dmesgs output, if that helps.
