You suppose it is a page of code ? What about data that programs malloc() ???
You can also send data memory to swap. If you do not write it on disk,
how do you recover it ???

That is your fault, <read-only>. Pages maped read-only are those from 
binary executables or shared libraries, but, again, what about data ?

I look at gnome system monitor graph for mem. I start with a tiny amount of
used memory. Start the 1Gb read without O_STREAM, the blue area in monitor
starts to grow linearly in time, stars (*) from the reader appear at a
given rate, and as soon as it touches the top limit the stars stop, the disk
begins to thrash, and swap space used grows. After a 2-4 seconds, the stars
go again with the same rate. Tell me what is this but swapper writing pages,
and reading the new pages for my giga.
With O_STREAM, the 'blue bar' does not move from its place, and star rate
(ie, read rate from disk), stays uniform.
