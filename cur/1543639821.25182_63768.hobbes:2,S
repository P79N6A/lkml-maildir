That piece of wierdness I'll take the blame for, not Matt. It's more complex, we 
just wanted to make the default be to have it turned on, maybe we've missed 
some way in the config to make it work like that?

That'd be easier if it was written in such a way it worked on all P4 systems.
For one, it does an rdtsc directly, which doesn't work on all machines.
For another, it assumes flat logical addressing mode. We need to be able
to disable this until it's rewritten in such a way as to be more generic.

Was there some reason you really need this on P4s? I seem to recall something
to do with timer interrupts, but don't remember exactly.

PS. I think __DO_ACTION gets an award for disgusting use of macros.
