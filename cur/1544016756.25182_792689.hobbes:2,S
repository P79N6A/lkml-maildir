The problem is that the kernel has an internal dependancy for using these
cards on the mmc-block driver but that is not expressed by the kernel.
This means that we have to maintain an external dependancy in the udev
package.  Unfortuanatly that is is not versioned with the kernel so
that adds a per distro maintenance burden ensuring udev is in step with
the kernel.

Yeah I can see how we might end up still loading the driver for all SDIO
cards once we support them correctly; possibly even for ones with no
storage if we are unable to tell from the underlying device.  The good
thing about expressing it this way is that should the kernel find out how
to do it we can modify the aliases and prevent the module loading on all
distros automatically.

It is about reducing external dependancies to simplify life for the
distro packagers.
Would it make more sense to simply use mmc: with no data as the MODALIAS
tag here.  And make mmc-block have mmc:* as an alias.  That way the
actual (useless) numeric data is not exposed but we still will load the
mmc-block module for everything exactly as we do with the udev rule.
This should still make things work from a distro point of view and not
expose anything which might then get relied on.  If we do it so extra
data can still be added later we won't prevent sane data being exposed
should we ever have any.
If you are happier with that I can re-spin the patches that way?
