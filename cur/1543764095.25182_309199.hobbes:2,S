Normally, esp will be immediately reset by any user-land stuff: we'll 
forget the old kernel stack entirely, and always re-load esp from the esp0 
thing in the TSS.
And as long as we stay in kernel land, we'll obviously never touch the
esp/xss fields of pt_regs (except in this special case of doing the
speculative load of xss), so...
