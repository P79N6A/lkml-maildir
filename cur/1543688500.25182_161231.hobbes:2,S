Hi
I installed the newest Kernel with rsync, done make menuconfig, make-kpkg
clean, make-kpkg kernel_image and dpkg --install kerne_image...
Now when I reboot I get:
Vector 700 at pc = 00000200, lr=c00ca708 msr =80000, sp = c0b13ea0
[c0b13df0] current = c0b12000, pid=1, comm = swapper
What can I do to get my maschine back up? It hangs after above message.

Thanks for your help.
