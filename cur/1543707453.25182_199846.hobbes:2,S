	I've updated the Linux HFS+ driver to a simple, easy to apply patch to 
your fresh 2.6.3 kernel; just go into file systems, and turn on HFSPlus 
(it's right below HFS).  You do need EXPERIMENTAL turned on to compile 
it.  I've tested it working on x86 for firewire access to an HFS+ 
formattted iPod.  Naturally, I welcome further testing by a wider 
selection of hardware combinations :)
