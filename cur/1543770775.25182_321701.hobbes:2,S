I can't quite see how, in my experience they involve the same 
effort, but i guess that's personal opinion.

But decisions for the Linux kernel must always be rational and technical. 
Regarding ease of maintenance, debugging/maintaining an application on a  
nanokernel (ie isolated) is a lot easier than something as large and 
complex as the Linux kernel. This also applies for QA and general 
verification.

Considering how controlling your management is, i'm surprised you'd stake 
your business on something as non deterministic as the Linux kernel 
mailing list.

I find that hard to believe literally any company which sells you 
operating system software will be more than willing to provide you support 
for the supplied components, obviously at a price but they are after all 
in the business of making money.

A volunteer supported public forum as a means of handling technical issues 
for a company doesn't sound like a good idea.

I can't quite see how you drew that conclusion. The fact is, pay someone 
and they'll resolve your problems.
