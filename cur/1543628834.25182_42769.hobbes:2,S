Subject: ext2 fs corruption on 2.5.10
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

2 machines, 2 partitions:
At first kernel hanged while calling hdparm, after removing hdparm from rc
scripts, it hangs while remounting rootfs read-write. After that, partition
is totally screwed up. All parts (ide, ext2) compiled as modules.
It's reproductible but I'm unable to reproduce it since I'm cutted out from
my Linux partition
