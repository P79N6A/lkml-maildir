BTW while talking about taste: I'd rather make certain modules not 
unloadable, than have code like stop_refcounts() in the kernel.
Module loading _and_ unloading could be so simple and fast, but it seems 
people prefer to keep the module stuff black magic. If nobody else cares I 
won't care either, alsa was the last reason I needed modules, now I can 
live without it.
bye, Roman
