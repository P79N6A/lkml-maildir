Btw, there's something else wrong, because the root hub shouldn't be 
suspended during boot, should it ? At least, it's not on 2.6.9. Also,
lsusb -v fails with long timeouts due to that on 2.6.10-rc1, not on 2.6.9.
I really think there's something wrong with the drivers/usb/host/ohci-hub.c 
patch I posted in the first message...
