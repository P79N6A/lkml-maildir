We would be impressed if it wasn't :)

There are some real ones there.  The ones surrounding lock_kernel() and
semaphores are false positives.
lock_kernel() is special, in that the lock is dropped when the caller
performs a voluntary context switch.  So there are no ordering requirements
between lock_kernel and the sleeping locks down(), down_read(), down_write().
lock_kernel() inside a spinlock is not necessarily a bug, but almost always
is.  It should be warned about.
