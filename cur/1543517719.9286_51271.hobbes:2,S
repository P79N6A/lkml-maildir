Hi Folks,
Briefly, can anybody tell me how far is Linux
ready for Enterprise-Computing ?
Expanding the same question, what are the
features that have been incorporated into the
Linux kernel for high-availability, 
high-reliability and servicability ? And in
case it is already there, Is it in the 
mainstream kernel or externally available ?
( As unofficial patches ? )
if it is not in the mainstream kernel, can
anybody tell me ( or direct me to a link) as to
why it has not been incorporated in the 
mainstream kernel ? Any specific reasons ?
Linus ?
And lastly what are points I might need to
consider in case I would like to include or
have these ( Servicability, high-availability and Reliability ) within the mainstream kernel
or as unofficial patches ?
