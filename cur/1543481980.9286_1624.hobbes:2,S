Ok, that's one suspect crossed off the list. Can't be the library. GDB
hasn't changed for a long time, neither has DDD. It works quite well with
different kernels I've used. Let's see if the problem occurs with earlier
kernels. If it doesn't, I think Linus will have to wear a paper bag over
his head.. ;o)
