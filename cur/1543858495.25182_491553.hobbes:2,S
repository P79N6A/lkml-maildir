No, that is not planned. 2.6.16.x is an exception.    -stable kernels
(those with 2.6.x.y versions) are only released for the latest stable
2.6.x kernel. So currently that's 2.6.19 and as soon as 2.6.20 comes
out there will not be any more 2.6.19.x, only 2.6.20.x   - I hope
that's clear...

No. If the problem was also in the latest stable kernel (currently
2.6.19.1) then a fix would go into 2.6.19.2 and users can then upgrade
to that kernel. If 2.6.19.1 is not vulnerable, then everything is fine
as users of old 2.6.17 kernels can just upgrade to 2.6.19.1

Not true. Slackware updates the kernel to fix security issues - this
has been the case in the past and i don't see why it would change in
the future.

probably.

Ehh, you wouldn't want to do that. You'd want to encourage an upgrade
to 2.6.19.1 instead.
