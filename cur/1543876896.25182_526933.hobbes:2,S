Good point.  Yes, sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF) really needs to continue
returning the number of CPUs online, to maintain compatibility with the
current implementation, and because with a name like that, just about
anything else would be "surprising".
And OpenMPI shouldn't be calling sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF), as it does
not want to know how much hardware is there, but rather how much hardware
it is allowed to use.  Something based on sched_getaffinity() would seem
to be ideal for its purposes.
