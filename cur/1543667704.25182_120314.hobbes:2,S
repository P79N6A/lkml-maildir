I have the feeling from Linus' reaction to the "dump to hd partiton"
feature, that he is all developer with little professional (paid to de
what someone else wants) admin experience. I tried to explain that
machines many timezones away in a secured environment make it hard to read
a console (none), insert a floppy, or use a serial cable. I actually
looked at serial, it would take (a) a capital budget for the cable, (b) a
labor budget for a cleared consultant to plug it in, (c) approval of the
network group because it's a data cable, and (d) a security analysis of
the risks of connecting two secure machines.
And of course the identical machines I can touch don't have that failure
mode :-(
Anyway you are not likely to see that in the official kernel unless Linus
has a change of heart, but you can patch it in so that's not critical,
just one more issue if you have to justify Linux vs. AIX or Solaris in a
bid.
