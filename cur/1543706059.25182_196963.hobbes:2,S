I think it also happens if you run a binary compiled on a
machine with such a glibc on another which has an older kernel
or the same glibc, but compiled with no --enable-kernel or an
older version set.
Can't test it, but:
My glibc was compiled with --enable-kernel=2.4.5.
A binary compiled with it:
% file /usr/bin/lsattr
/usr/bin/lsattr: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), for GNU/Linux 2.4.5, dynamically linked (uses shared libs), stripped
A binary that came with the default glibc:
% file /usr/bin/ansi2knr
/usr/bin/ansi2knr: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), for GNU/Linux 2.0.0, dynamically linked (uses shared libs), stripped
Yes, the default glibc was compiled without --enable-kernel, so
is compatible with >= 2.0.0.
Anyway, not a kernel problem. I have also seen it when trying
to emulate my binaries on FreeBSD, which has compatibility set
to... 2.4.2.
