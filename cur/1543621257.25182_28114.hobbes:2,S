Known behaviour - ie. don't do that.
On most systems a "make -j4", or 6, or even 8 will work. But SOMETHING has
to give after memory fills up. The number of processes to use for -j
depends on the system. On mine (256MB, dual pentium pro) I don't do more
than 6, and 4 works best (lets me run solitare too).
