I'm not sure, if I understand correctly. However, I meant, in the case of hdd as
/dev/hda and cdrom as /dev/hdc, it works:
/usr/bin/hotswap --ide-controller 1 -n probe-ide
/usr/bin/hotswap --ide-controller 1 -n unregister-ide
remove cdrom here
after pluging cdrom back:
/usr/bin/hotswap --ide-controller 1 -n probe-ide
/usr/bin/hotswap --ide-controller 1 -n rescan-ide
I think, DMA cannot be turned on if cdrom was not plugged in at boot time for
some reason.
But things above do not work if hdd is /dev/hda and cdrom is /dev/hdb, i.e. on
the same channel.
Again, is it an IDE conception bug?
