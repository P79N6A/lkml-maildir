When I do the following to FC5, I am able to boot kernel.org kernels w/o
an initrd:
        # mount --bind / /mnt
	# cd /mnt/dev
	# mknod null c 1 3
	# mknod console c 5 1
	# for i in $(seq 0 9); do mknod tty$i c 4 $i; done
	# cd /
	# umount /mnt
IMHO, FC5's failure to set up a minimal disk-based /dev like this
is a bug on its part.

Joe
