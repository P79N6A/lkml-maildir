The problem is percpu_counter_sum has to read all the cpus cachelines.  If
we have to use percpu_counter_sum everywhere, then might as well use plain
per-cpu counters instead of  batching ones no?
sysctl_mem[0] is about 196K  and on a 16 cpu box variance is 512 bytes, which 
is OK with just percpu_counter_read I hope.  Maybe, on very large cpu counts, 
we should just change the FBC_BATCH so that variance does not go quadratic.
Something like 32.  So that variance is 32 * NR_CPUS in that case, instead
of (NR_CPUS * NR_CPUS * 2) currently.  Comments?
