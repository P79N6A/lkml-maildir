I usually use these patch commands, as they make finding any 
errors so much easier:
bunzip patchfile.bz2 ## or...
gunzip patchfile.gz
cd linux-2.4.x
## To see if the patch is actually going to work
patch -p1 --batch --quiet --dry-run < ../patchfile
## To actually apply the patch
patch -p1 --batch --quiet < ../patchfile
