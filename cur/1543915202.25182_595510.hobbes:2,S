There is no -ENOMEM approach. Lower order page allocation (< 
PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER) will reclaim and in the worst case the OOM killer 
will be activated. That is the nature of the failures that we saw early in 
the year when this was first merged into mm.

ZONE_MOVABLE creates two memory pools in a machine. One of them is for 
movable and one for unmovable. That is in 2.6.23. So 2.6.23 has no first 
call support for order 0 pages?

fsblock also needs contiguous pages in order to have a beneficial 
effect that we seem to be looking for.

Sure the system works fine as is. Not sure why we would need fsblock then.

That would imply a new API or something? I do not see it.

Ok the logical conclusion from the above is that you think your approach 
is rubbish.... Is there some way you could cool down a bit?
