Hallo,
	I want to report multiple crashes while using last stable kernel, the message 
it gives is:
--------------------
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 45ca6234

--------------------
	Then it refuses to do "anything reasonable" (probably forking a new thread), 
but ping works and some applications are partially running (e.g. Apache 
serves static page, but not CGI). No user can log in.
	It prints the message above multiple times, probably at each atempt to do 
something. Sometimes (not the first time) it also writes "Bug: ... twice..." 
(I don't remember it, sorry, it isn't written in messages).
	On the machine are large blocks of shared memory (hundreds of MB, usually 
larger than default SHMMAX, which is now set to 256MB), crash happened while 
processing large amounts of data (few GB, hundreds of MB RAM used).
	Other info: Red Hat Linux 7.3, kernel 2.4.19 from kernel.org, single Athlon 
XP, compiled with Athlon processor option and "4GB" memory setting.
         If you need more information, feel free to ask me. Do you know what 
happened and if it can be fixed?
	Thanks,
Michal Illich
