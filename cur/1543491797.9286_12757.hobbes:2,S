I have had very similar results with a computer with the same card.
Right now, I can't find the same message you quoted above (I am
accessing it via a congested Internet connection), although
I am sure I have seen it, but I do get ones like the following:
Mar 29 10:01:21 share kernel: eth0: tx interrupt but no status
Mar 29 10:01:21 share last message repeated 3 times
Mar 29 15:45:50 share kernel: eth0: transmit aborted, too many collisions
Mar 29 16:06:22 share kernel: eth0: transmit aborted, too many collisions
Mar 29 16:23:50 share kernel: eth0: transmit aborted, too many collisions
I don't trust that particular computer one bit, so I wouldn't have
mentioned it but it sounds a little bit similar to the problems you
describe.
The "too many collisions" might be network congestion. I haven't
bothered to investigate yet. Is this normal?
(Off-topic: On startup I get the following errors, first three repeated x3:
Mar 29 21:17:13 share kernel: hda: drive not ready for command
Mar 29 21:17:13 share kernel: hda: status error: status=0x01 { Error }
Mar 29 21:17:13 share kernel: hda: status error: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
Mar 29 21:17:13 share kernel: hda: drive not ready for command
Mar 29 21:17:13 share kernel: ide0: reset: success
- the harddisk appears to work OK however I am very suspicious and don't
trust it or the computer).
However, in my case, these messages haven't had any noticable
affect on system useability. The computer does seem slow, but it
is only a 40MHz 486 with 16Mb ram (I think)...

I haven't had this computer crash on me. Apart from rather
serious looking messages, it seems rather reliable ;-).
