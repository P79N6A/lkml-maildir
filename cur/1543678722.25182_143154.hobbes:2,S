Problem appears to be from hardware, Vojtech Pavlik helped me a bit to
track it down.  Hardware occasionally doesn't send the key release
signal after a key pressed signel.
System is IBM Thinkpad R30, CPU permanently running on low speed
(700MHz), no speed step (unsupported chipset).
Should I still test w/ clock=pit?
