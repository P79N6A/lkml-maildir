Hi Andrew,
the timer patch made it to BitKeeper! That is very nice, the patch
has been around for quite a long time. Now only the oprofile patch
and the xip2fs question needs to be resolved and I'm a really happy
camper :-)
The oprofile code should be fine now, I added all suggestion I got
from the mailing list and Arnd double checked it. The other 5
patches are continuous bug fixes.
Descriptions:
1) s390 core changes.
2) Common i/o layer fixes. The new single threaded workqueues are
   nice for the cio layer.
3) Network driver fixes.
4) 3270 console driver fix.
5) zfcp host adapter fix.
6) Add oprofile support for s390.
blue skies,
  Martin.
