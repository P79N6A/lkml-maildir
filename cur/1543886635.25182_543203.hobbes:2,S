My summary:
(1) The patch is safe-as is, though it should move its hook elsewhere.
(2) Scribbling on the memory still irks me but is safe.
(3) I should redo the i386 pgd updates to suck less.
(4) Christoph might let me change quicklists to use struct page pointers.
For (3) I can post the update any time; it won't conflict with the
quicklist code, apart from textually, and I can handle the mergework.
The case one should hold off on merging the quicklist code is if
Christoph wants to update the core quicklist code or have me update
it according to the cached precomputed value scheme I outlined in a
prior post before its initial merge. I'll prepare all the patches for
comment regardless.
