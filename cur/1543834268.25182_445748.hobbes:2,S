Nope, it doesn't violate POSIX/SuSv3.  The specifications only control
what happens if the system is cleanly shutdown.  What happens on an
unclean shutdown is explicitly undefined.  Hence, lazy atime update
where there is a "dirty" and "mostly clean" (i.e., atime-dirty) bit,
and where "mostly clean" inodes are only flushed out to disk when they
become fully dirty and then written out to disk, or when the
filesystem is unmounted, or when the filesystem feels like it (i.e.,
when we need to clear out in-core inodes in response to memory
pressure), would in fact be completely POSIX/SuSv3 compliant.
