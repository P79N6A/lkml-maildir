The 70% dbt3 improvement is extremely fishy.  Yes, there are things in
2.6.6-rc3 which could improve database workloads by that much, but dbt3
doesn't appear to be using them.
Again, the vmstat traces indicate that after a run on 2.6.6-rc3 we have a
full gigabyte less used pagecache than with 2.6.5.  In both cases there is
still a lot of free memory.  Which tends to indicate that the -rc3 run was,
for some reason, not an equivalent workload - it's using a smaller dataset.
I'd suggest that you double-check these results, try and work out why the
-rc3 run is touching less data.  Maybe go back and redo the 2.6.5 test?
