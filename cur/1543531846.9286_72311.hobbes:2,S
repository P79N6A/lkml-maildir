i386 is the only platform I am able to test. I assume that other
platforms need the change as well, if you want I can cook up a patch that
does this, although I will not be able to test it. 
On a related note, the patch was not 100% complete, there is one more
dependency that I have been able to resolve since I posted the patch.
On the less bright side, there is one nasty keyboard-related
dependency left that I have not been able to solve.
