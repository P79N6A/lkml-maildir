Hi,
I wanted to know if modulescan be developed in the linux kernel, which
can create TCP/UDP sockets and communicate with perhaps webservices,
residing in the user level in the same computer or in some other
computer.
Is a networking API available in the linux kernel which can be used by
linux kernel modules, if so is there any documentation for it?
Thank  you
Irfan
