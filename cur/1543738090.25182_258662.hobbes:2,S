Okay, that can work.
Except that the hooks ARE needed NOW.
Right NOW, there is a programmer working on the RAID management
interface, and he needs those hooks (or something similar)
to compile and test his code against the driver.
Remember, the vendor wants to decouple the RAID management from
the in-tree kernel code.  They fully want to open-source (GPL)
all of it, but in two pieces:  (1) core driver to boot/run the system,
and (2) loadable component to provide advanced RAID management.
It is anticipated that development of (2) will take some time
and have many revisions, and they really want to decouple it's
release from that of the stock kernel.  Thus, the latest version
of that code will be provided via website and installation CD
to customers who actually buy/use the product.
I wonder if there's a better way to do this?
