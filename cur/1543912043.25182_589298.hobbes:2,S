OK, but for elf case this seems useless since the top of the stack is
already randomized.
It seems that the randomization stuff (top of the stack + stack
pointer inside a page) belongs to the elf binary format whereas it
could have been part of exec.c. Are there any reasons ?

Well not really because for mips case, we have:
	$ git grep ELF_PLATFORM include/asm-mips
	include/asm-mips/elf.h:#define ELF_PLATFORM  (NULL)
So on mips, the stack pointer won't get the inside the page
randomization. Is that correct ?
If so, I'm wondering why this randomization must depend on that string
to be defined. I must admit that I'm not sure how it's used. I guess
it's used by ld.so and it could be set to "mips" for now...
thanks
