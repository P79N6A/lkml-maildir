The "@60" did it. (Reading "man 4x savage" -> "UseBIOS" gives my the
impression, that this is important for some mobile chips.)

That (partly) solved the lockup: I was able start XFree86, switch back
to Console, but on return to X11, the X11 screen wasn't restored
correctly, the mouse left a trail behind and switching to console
again didn't work. (a remove "chvt 1" as root still worked). Exiting
and than restarting XFree86 sometimes didn't initialize the screen
correctly.
While writing this email, my notebook locked up again hard and I had to
powercycle it.
