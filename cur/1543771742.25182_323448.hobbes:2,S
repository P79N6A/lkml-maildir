Ditto, and its been conservative enough that not only does it stay
pretty stable (one partition slip-up so far is very good indeed) its
small enough that most of the add on patches people use aren't breaking
against it either. Even the -ac set just keeps applying barring makefile
just fine so its saved me a ton of work.
