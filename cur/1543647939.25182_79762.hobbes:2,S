i wanted to do this as part of the irqlock cleanups, but generally we dont
change existing interfaces unless it's really universally agreed upon. Eg.  
we had cli() around for a *long* time although it's an x86 (-mostly)
instruction name. But yes, i agree, and there are a number of other
renames that would make perfect sense.
