On Linux 2.4.18, I can no longer mount CDROMs that were created
using ext2 as the file-system (yes I know this is not specified).
I used to use these CDROMs as part of a "rescue" package.
Now, these can still be mounted through the loop device as is
shown below....
Script started on Mon May 20 11:12:16 2002
# mount /dev/sr0 /mnt
mount: block device /dev/sr0 is write-protected, mounting read-only
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sr0,
       or too many mounted file systems
# mount -o loop /dev/sr0 /mnt
# ls /mnt
bin  dev  etc  lib  lost+found	mnt  root  sbin  tmp  usr
# umount /mnt
# exit
exit

So the question is, how could I put the mount options on the command
line during LILO boot? I tried root=/dev/sr0 {failed}
                               root="/dev/sr0 -o loop" {failed}
                               root=/dev/sr0,-o,loop {failed}
...etc...
..or.. is there a problem that is going to be fixed to revert to
the older behavior ..or.. Am I going to have to redo my rescue
stuff to use iso-9660?
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
