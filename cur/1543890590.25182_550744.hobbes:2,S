Hmmm, I just found something interesting. In 2.6.21.3 the /sbin/init
gets corrupted when I watch the video!
$ cp /sbin/init init.before
$ mplayer kiwi.flv
$ cp /sbin/init init.after
The sha1sums are here:
52c8d643057619cbe137b8e69d4709ce3bdd832d  init.after
8efc7864a5b535a9e336fa82e9d7f112f3d956c1  init.before
It seems that something corrupts memory somewhere...
I attached those files in case someone can figure out
what is happening.
