Subject: [PATCH] loopback device can't act as its backing store
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The patch below fixes a bug in loop which apparently causes the kernel to call
the initialization routine of a loopback device recursively while trying to set
the backing store to the loopback device it's being mapped to.
Ludwig Schmidt <ludoschmidt@web.de> found this misbehaviour by accident. After
having been informed by him, I analyzed the problem and wrote this patch.
You can verify this bug for instance by issuing the following command
     # mount -o loop /dev/loop0 /mnt
with /dev/loop0 being the first free loop device. You should sync before. ;-)
However, if you try setting the backing file of the loopback device using the
losetup utility, you won't experience any crash. For example:
     # losetup /dev/loop0 /dev/loop0
But as a matter of fact, the device will be busy until the next reboot. Forced
unloading of loop will succeed. But after reloading, the kernel will lock up on
any attempt accessing a loop device.
Consequently this bug needs to be resolved in any case, although it seems that
there may also be a bug in the mount utility. By looking at the source code of
mount, which ironically shares the same codebase as losetup within the
util-linux package, I couldn't find anything suspicious.
This bug is fully reproduceable on at least all recent 2.6 series kernels.
The patch below applies cleanly on 2.6.10-rc2.
Comments would be graciously appreciated as this being my first serious kernel
patch. ;-)
