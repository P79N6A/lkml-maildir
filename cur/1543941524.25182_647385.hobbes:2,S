Yep. Just make sure that they have the exact same format string,
otherwise the marker infrastructure will refuse to connect probes to
them (and will printk an error message saying this). You can even put a
marker in an inline function or unrolled loop (many markers will be
generated and this is ok).

Ok, I agree with your approach. About using the markers, I wonder if it
would be best for me to continue to concentrate my effort in getting the
low-level stuff into the kernel first or to switch my focus on posting
the higher-level stuff : the tracer itself, which is mostly a
stand-alone kernel module.
