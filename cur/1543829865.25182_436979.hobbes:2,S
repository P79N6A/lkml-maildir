First check /proc/asound/cards after loading snd-atiixp.  If the ATI
IXP entry appears, the device was initialized and set up.  If not,
something wrong in the driver initialization.
Then check whether /dev/snd/controlC0 exists.  If not, it's likely a
udev thingy.  Possibly upgrading udev package might help...
