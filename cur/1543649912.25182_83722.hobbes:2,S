Actually if I use noapci then the irq affinity stuff does not work, which in
itself causes
the jitter to be unexceptable. On the AMD, the process and irq affinity appears
to be working
correctly, according to /proc/interrupts, but maybe it's really not??? Thats
what it acts
like. It acts just like if I hadn't set the affinity for the emulation and irq
on the P4,
just not as bad.
