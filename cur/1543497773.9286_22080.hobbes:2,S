No silly, he wants to provide his own read_actor_t, which is a very
powerful concept.  And the reason Linus made the structure/types there
in the first place is that he did indeed think that allowing other
kernel entities to use the do_generic_file_read interface directly
might be quite useful.  And it is.
Think about the things we can do with it for nfsd for example...
