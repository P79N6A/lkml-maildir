The only problem with using %gs as a base register is that reloading it 
on every entry and exit is rather expensive (GDT access and priviledge 
checks) compared to masking bits off %esp.  x86-64 can get away with it 
because it has the swapgs instruction which makes it efficient to use.

Not possible.  GCC completely assumes that we are working with a single 
flat address space.  It has no concept of segmentation at all.
