MD5 protection on BGP sessions isn't very common yet. MD5 uses CPU,
and routers don't usually have much of that. Which means that now an
MD5 CPU attack is possible instead of a TCP RST attack.
The "TTL hack" solution is safer. Make sure sender uses a TTL
of 255, on the receiver discard all packets with a TTL < 255.
You can use iptables to implement that on a Linux box.
Mike.
