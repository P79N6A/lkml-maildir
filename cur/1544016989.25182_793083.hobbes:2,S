Yeah, if anyone proposes XML, I'll punch them :)  I'm not that firm on
it being ASCII myself, but it would be OK.  Google's protocol buffers
are a good example of a very efficient encoding of flexible data.
This is not an unsolvable problem.

I remember - I was at Sun at the time.  We wanted the same thing.

Yes, it will be hard.  But I think it will not be impossible.

Sure, but just having a small buffer, like mcelog, and being
poll()able goes a log way.

We do a lot of this now, but it's far less accurate than it could be,
because we drop so many events.  And programming to all the different
interfaces is difficult and error-prone.
I'm hoping we can find a solution that makes everyone only a little bit unhappy.
