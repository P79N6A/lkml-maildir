This code needs real physical addresses, which are not the same things
as bus addresses.  I thought from what Rik said that virt_to_phys
should give you real physical addresses, while virt_to_pfn would give
you the contiguous "physical" page numbers - is that the case?

Well, a northbridge register.  The northbridge is in a privileged
position in that it controls the memory and can access all of it
directly using physical addresses, something which PCI or other
devices can't.  The address you poke into a register to define the
base of the table is a physical address.  How could it be a bus
address, when the whole point of the table is to translate bus
addresses to physical addresses?  If it was a bus address you would
have to know where the table was before you could work out where the
table was.

No, the GART is a bridge between a bus and memory, and the GATT
entries are physical addresses.

This is also wrong - the base address of the GATT is a physical
address not a bus address.  This change will break agpgart on ppc64
systems and I won't be able to play bzflag on my G5 any more. :)
dma_alloc_coherent allocates iommu entries and returns a bus address,
but the addresses coming out of the GART don't go through a further
translation through the iommu.

It sounds like xen is trying to overload the concepts of physical and
bus addresses to represent the mapping from "logical" addresses seen
by the kernel to "absolute" addresses (the "real" physical
addresses).  IMHO that is a mistake and will only lead to trouble.
