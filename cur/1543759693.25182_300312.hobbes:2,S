No you're right, I'm not 100% sure, so I'm definitely not saying
Ben's test will be useless. Just that if it is not too hard to
make one with sendfile, I think he should.
If he makes a network-only version and cannot reproduce the problems,
that *doesn't* mean it is *not* a network problem. However if he
reproduces the problem with a full sendfile version and not the network
only one, then that is a better indicator... but I'm rambling.

I have heard other complaints about this, and they are definitely
related to the scheduler (not saying yours is, but it is very possible).
