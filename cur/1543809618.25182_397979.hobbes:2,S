I think that's a mistake.  Yes, James has decided to object, but I
think that James' objections are unfounded.
Since James doesn't even have a machine which shows this bug, it's
rather convenient for him to object and effectively stand in the way
of having the bug being fixed.
Or that's how I'm reading the current impass on these patches.
Linus - can we merge Tejun's patches so that we have an IDE subsystem
which works on ARM platforms please?  If James wants to come up with
another solution later on, I'm sure we can transition all drivers
over to that new solution once we know what it is.  Until then, can
we please fix the bug?
