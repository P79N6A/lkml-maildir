<snip>
You are right. But our idea is to provide an option to disable/enable
caching based on the nature of intended application.
[EH] Hear hear :-).  
Our application consists of a number of machines collaborating on a shared
database over NFS.  We therefore require the ability to force data to be
sync'd from the client to the backend - and at the moment we do this by
disabling caching completely, via the noac option and acquiring and
releasing non-exclusive locks round io calls.
Any improvements in the granularity of control over NFS client-side caching
would be very valuable to us.
