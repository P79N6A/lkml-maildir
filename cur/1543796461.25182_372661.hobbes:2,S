The patch still has problems, and it can lead to more page allocations in
remote nodes.
For NUMA systems, basicly HPC applications want locality, and file servers
want cache consistency. More worse two types of applications can coexist in one
single system. The general solution may be classifying pages into two types:
local  pages: mostly local accessed, and low latency is first priority
global pages: for consistent file caching
Reclaims from global pages should be balanced globally to make a seamlessly
single global cache. We can allocate special zones to hold the global pages,
and make the reclaims from them in sync. Nick, are you working on this?
Thanks,
Wu
