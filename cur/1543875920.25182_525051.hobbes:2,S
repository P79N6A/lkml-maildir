Yes, this is possible. DIVAS itself does not depend on CAPI.

Yes, but for only for experts who want to use the DIVAS own API
without CAPI.

That would not be correct.

I see. So for DIVAS the line 
  obj-$(CONFIG_ISDN_CAPI)                    += hardware/
causes the trouble, because all hardware/ driver are meant to be CAPI 
drivers...
In that case we should change hardware/eicon/ as you proposed:
> - let ISDN_DIVAS depend on ISDN_CAPI and
So the solution might be just to change
    menu "Active Eicon DIVA Server cards"
      depends on NET && ISDN && ISDN_CAPI!=n
to 
    menu "Active Eicon DIVA Server cards"
      depends on NET && ISDN && ISDN_CAPI
in drivers/isdn/hardware/eicon/Kconfig
right?
