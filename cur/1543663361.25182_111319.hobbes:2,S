This comment at sched.c:843 is a bit confusing:
 * We fend off statistical fluctuations in runqueue lengths by
 * saving the runqueue length during the previous load-balancing
 * operation and using the smaller one the current and saved lengths.
First, it's ungrammatical ("...the smaller one the...").  Second,
the code immediately following it seems to be choosing the _larger_
of the two values, not the smaller:
if (idle || (this_rq->nr_running > this_rq->prev_nr_running[this_cpu]))
	nr_running = this_rq->nr_running;
else
	nr_running = this_rq->prev_nr_running[this_cpu];
