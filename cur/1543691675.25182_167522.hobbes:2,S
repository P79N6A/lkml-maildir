I don't think this has to do with ext3, since my root xfs partition can't be 
mounted either.

same over here, except replace hda2 with sda3 and (302 with 803 of couse).

I disabled mount at root and created some device nodes, but it still doesn't 
work, befor that I had pure devfs. Reading the config help for devfs says 
it's obsoleted, and stripped down to a "bare minimum to not break anyting". 
Does that "bare minimum" include hard disks?
