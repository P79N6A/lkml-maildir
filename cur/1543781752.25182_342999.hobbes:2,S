I don't consider this "gratious renaming". I didn't do this just
because I could. I did it because the names used in the locking API
are quite inconsistent and not exactely pretty. I did it to make
things cleaner, neater, more consistent - to do everyone a favour.
Yes, it's just renaming of functions, it doesn't actually change any
behaviour, but why should we have to live with less-than-perfect
naming when we can clean it up?
