If that ever happens just -fPIC mode would need to be supported
and a proper PLT for the references between modules and kernel. It would complicate 
the module loader slightly, but not too much.

I recently submitted a patch to fix the 2GB limit for user space
binaries (missing O_LARGEFILE). I think it made it into .25.
Newer gcc/binutils support the large code model so you could actually
try to generate binaries that big :-) e.g. some of the rtl-to-C compilers
seem to generate huge code so it might be actually useful.
Also of course you can always split the executable into ~2GB shared libraries.
