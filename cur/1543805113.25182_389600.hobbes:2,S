Subject: [PATCH] sky2: fix hang on Yukon-EC (0xb6) rev 1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch for sky2 fixes a hang on Yukon-EC (0xb6) rev 1
where suddenly no more interrupts were delivered.
I don't know the real cause of the hang due to lack of docs,
but the patch has been running stable for a few hours
whereas the unmodified driver will hang after less than
2 minutes.
Regards,
Carl-Daniel
