Actually I think the real problem was that "KD_GRAPHICS" got  
overloaded to mean "some userspace program is probably poking at the  
GPU in very direct ways possibly including /dev/mem".  As such it  
really isn't safe at all for the kernel to write stuff to the screen  
in that situation; you could turn a panic()+reboot-after-30-secs into  
an unrecoverable hard PCI bus lockup.  IIRC there were at least a  
couple chipsets which had that problem with X.  If we can implement  
enough APIs for X to do all of its stuff from userspace without iopl 
() or /dev/mem then we could probably bring back the option for  
dumping oopses to screen in KD_GRAPHICS mode, but otherwise it'll  
just cause more headaches.
