I wonder how does Intel suggest we handle this problem? Batch scheduling
aside, I wonder how to do any sort of priorities at all? I think POWER5
can do priorities in hardware, that is the only sane way I can think of
doing it.
I think this patch is much too ugly to get into such an elegant scheduler.
No fault to you Con because its an ugly problem.
How about this: if a task is "delta" priority points below a task running
on another sibling, move it to that sibling (so priorities via timeslice
start working). I call it active unbalancing! I might be able to make it
fit if there is interest. Other suggestions?
