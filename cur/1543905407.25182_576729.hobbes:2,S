Ok, found it " hid_blacklist is alphabetically sorted blacklist by quirk type. "
But is there a Order for the bitfields? e.g
shouldn't: hid-quriks.c (line 439, 440)
{ USB_VENDOR_ID_APPLE, USB_DEVICE_ID_APPLE_FOUNTAIN_ANSI, 
HID_QUIRK_POWERBOOK_HAS_FN | HID_QUIRK_IGNORE_MOUSE } 
be:
{..., ..., HID_QUIRK_IGNORE_MOUSE | HID_QUIRK_POWERBOOK_HAS_FN }
Anyway, thanks for merging! 
	Chr.
