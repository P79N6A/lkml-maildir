Of course, when writing an application using pthreads you can make use of
pthread_atfork() to register functions that will run in the parent before
the fork, in the parent after the fork, and in the child after the fork.  If
you are writing a shared library with which other applications will be
linked, this is an excellent way (the only way?) to perform cleanup when
application threads fork().
