ok, so i'll have to come up with some hard data about code you maintain 
i guess - please provide contrary data if you have it.
Using the "code-quality" script mentioned at:
   
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/x86.git/README
on the Sparc64 tree:
   $ code-quality `find arch/sparc64/ include/asm-sparc64/ -name '*.c'` | 
        tee ~/quality-sparc.txt
   $ sort -n -k 4 ~/quality-sparc.txt | tail -20
shows the following "20 worst files":
                                      errors   lines of code   errors/KLOC

arch/sparc64/boot/piggyback.c             47             110         427.2
most of these are certainly legacy stuff that dont matter to active 
maintenance anymore (nobody will ever change math-emu/math.c i hope), 
but for example looking at:
  scripts/checkpatch.pl --file arch/sparc64/kernel/cpu.c
  [...]
  total: 17 errors, 2 warnings, 154 lines checked
all 17 errors and both warnings are legitimate complaints and if i was 
maintaining that file i'd accept any patch that cleans those problems 
up, in a heartbeat.
And today's mainstream files might become tomorrow's legacy files. To 
come up with a hypothetical example: had you applied checkpatch.pl on 
all changes to this file in the past 15 years (checkpatch.pl only exists 
for less than 5 years so this is hypothetical), you'd have a 
squeaky-clean file and no need for any annoying "monkey patches".
or take a look at the 65 errors that arch/sparc64/kernel/signal32.c 
produces:
  total: 65 errors, 33 warnings, 1391 lines checked
i've just checked all of the 65 errors and all look legitimate at first 
sight and should be fixed.
even looking at "best of breed" arch/sparc64 code, arch/sparc64/mm/*.c 
gives 34 errors:
  scripts/checkpatch.pl --file arch/sparc64/mm/*.c | grep ERROR | wc -l
  34
all of which seem legitimate complaints.
so the score right now: checkpatch versus DaveM 116:0 ;-)
i'm sure there are false positives in it too, but in my experience (from 
the scheduler and from arch/x86) there's less than 1 false positive for 
every 100 legitimate errors that checkpatch.pl it finds. So for the 1500 
errors reported by checkpatch.pl for the whole sparc64 tree:
                            errors   lines of code   errors/KLOC
  arch/sparc64/               1460           49801          29.3
i estimate that there will be less than 15 false positive "ERROR" lines, 
and my random sample of about 100 errors confirms that rate. That's a 
diminishing rate IMO.
as a comparison, core kernel code has this 'style quality':
                            errors   lines of code   errors/KLOC
  kernel/                      727          100364           7.2
in my experience, subsystems (of any significant size - i.e. above a few 
KLOC) where errors/KLOC is "single digit", has very clean code in 
general. Subsystems that have low-double-digit errors/KLOC are OK-ish, 
subsystems with high-double-digit or triple-digit errors/KLOC are messy. 
There can be fluctuations and artifacts, and obviously this is just 
another (arbitrary) static metric that has no forced relationship with 
real code quality - but in my experience it's surprisingly close to 
reality - closer than any other code metric i've seen.
