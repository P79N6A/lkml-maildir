[PATCH] I2C: Fix for i2c-piix4 with on some boards
Hello all.  On some boards with an Intel PIIX4 the BIOS (such as the one
found on a Force CPCI-735) will incorrectly configure the chipset, and
leaves a register in an undefined state causing i2c to behave strangley.
The following patches (first vs lm_sensors-2.8.0 and then vs
2.6.0-test3)  fixes the issue.
