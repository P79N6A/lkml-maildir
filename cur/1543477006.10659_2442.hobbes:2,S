Very interesting.  I am still seeking clues for why my backport of
Pavels nbd to 2.0.* locks up sometimes under 2.0.36, with an
"impossible" condition, but runs perfectly under 2.0.25 - even in a
kernel in which the nbd device is treated as pluggable.  What I see
reminds me strongly of what you describe (still, I'm OK - I use 2.0.25
:).
