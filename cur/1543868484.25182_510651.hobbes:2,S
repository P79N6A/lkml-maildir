I'm trying to figure out if an issue I'm having with sysrq (more  
likely with receiving a BREAK) is a HW issue or software.
If I have a lot of spew in the kernel (like a printk in receive_chars 
()) sysrq seems to work properly, in that the character sent after  
the break is properly received.  However, if I don't have any spew  
the character after the break than I get the wrong character:
[   22.607920] SysRq : in __sysrq_get_key_op key:255
[   34.856712] SysRq : in __sysrq_get_key_op key:255
[   44.823519] SysRq : in __sysrq_get_key_op key:252
[   51.306161] SysRq : in __sysrq_get_key_op key:240
[   60.947047] SysRq : in __sysrq_get_key_op key:252
[   65.942674] SysRq : in __sysrq_get_key_op key:128
[  102.251461] SysRq : in __sysrq_get_key_op key:254
It seems like hw is treating part of the break as a valid received  
character.  But, wanted to see if there were any ideas before I  
consider this a HW issue.
