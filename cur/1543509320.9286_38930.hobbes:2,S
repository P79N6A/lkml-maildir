Well no.  But there is one again now.  And seeing as the author (who may
have something to say about all this, now cc'ed) doesn't currently have a
version up for recent 2.2.x or 2.3.x, it's too late for this dev cycle
(most likely).

Relatively simple?  Checkpointing is a rather complex thing to do, as I
understand it.  And, I'd almost be willing to be once that patch hit the
masses, so to speak, a few bugs would show up.

Well, you can't sit around hopping to be noticed, you gotta go around and
talk to people.

Getting the authors opinion on things is good too. :)
