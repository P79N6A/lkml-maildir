applied, thanks Johannes.
I agree that such code needs to be more resilient, and resilience is 
mainly driven by observing random incidents as they happen in the field. 
So please keep sending such patches (even if they might seem dubious to 
you at first sight), they do make a lot of sense - and even if a patch 
does not end up getting applied your submission documents the incident.
