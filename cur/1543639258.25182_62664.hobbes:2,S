Your BIOS misconfigured the memory control registers. You may find
swapping the DIMMs over fixes that or a BIOS update. If you don't want
to update your BIOS then doing
echo "base=0x00000000 size=0x60000000 type=write-back" >/proc/mtrr
should override the BIOS setting and make your machine speed up.
