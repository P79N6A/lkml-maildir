I ran the tests with a configuration as close to yours as possible. Here are 
the results for mem=256M, 2G total file size (ext3):
2.4.25:
       Time spent for test:  79.4146s
                0.20user 16.08system 3:20.29elapsed 8%CPU
       Time spent for test:  78.9797s
                0.11user 15.84system 3:19.76elapsed 7%CPU 
2.6.6-bk, AS:
       Time spent for test:  81.2208s
                0.13user 17.97system 3:13.30elapsed 9%CPU

This correlates very well your results. But when I returned back to my 
original configuration (mem=640M, 3G total file size), I got the following:
2.4.25:
       Time spent for test:  77.5377s
2.6.6-bk, AS:
       Time spent for test:  83.1929s
It seems like the smaller file size just hides the regression, but I have to 
run some more tests to ensure this.

It's IDE disk without TCQ support with writeback caching enabled.
