It works fine here:
    13:49:15 appel ~$ uname -a
    Linux appel.dyndns.org 2.2.17 #1 Wed Sep 6 01:05:43 CEST 2000 ppc unknown

Just wednesday I was asking around for more recent gcc powerpc .debs,
but gcc-2.95.2 was judged to be `quite stable' for powerpc, by the gcc
maintainer.  Because there seemed to be no binaries available, I built
my own, get them at your own risk from:
    
ftp://appel.dyndns.org/pub/debian/gcc
    
http://appel.dyndns.org/debian/gcc
it's:
    13:52:33 appel ~$ gcc -v
    Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/powerpc-linux/2.95.3/specs
    gcc version 2.95.3 19991030 (prerelease/franzo/20000625)

It would be nice to hear if the newer gcc fixes your problems.
Greetings,
Jan.
