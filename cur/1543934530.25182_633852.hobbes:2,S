I prefer it single-line. I also disagree on %lx being a hack.

Looks fine to me. If you mean the new line after variables -- that was always optional.
Anyways I'll repost with the error check.
Also it seems like you did apply only parts of the patchkit. If you do that can
you send a list of what patches you didn't add, otherwise it'll be messy to figure
this out from here.
