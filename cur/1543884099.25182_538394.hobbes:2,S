Subject: [PATCH] MAINTAINERS: Add cxacru website/mailing list
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/1/414

I've not made any contact with the developers of the sourceforge project, 
but it would be useful for users to able to find the mailing list and the 
website for firmware information even if the driver page is very out of 
date right now.

I will email Roman Kagan once I think my cxacru-info utility is ready to 
be released and to point out that the driver's been in the kernel for a 
while and doesn't need to be obtained from cvs.infradead.org (Duncan: are 
you able to make changes to that CVS repository?).
