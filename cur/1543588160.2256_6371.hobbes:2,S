Hmm...i guess there is a communication issue here.  It sounds like the
message that our ML server was sending was misleading.  We were not
rejecting mail because of content.  The ML server was rejecting it because
the address was not subscribed.  Our idea was that we don't want spam. 
If it's completely unmoderated, then we will get a *lot* of spam.
Did anyone bother to e-mail the list admins?  Perhaps it was too difficult
to figure out who to mail about this, but I know for a fact that Rik van
Riel and Jens Axboe could post to linux-lvm@sistina.com.  It would have been
nice if they had mentioned something to us.

True, but it seems silly to duplicate the load if it's not necessary.

Sometimes I have a difficult time handling myself in social situations.
I just start scampering around neurotically, frantically jumping all
over guests. I think it all goes back to when I was raised in the wild
by miniature schnauzers.
