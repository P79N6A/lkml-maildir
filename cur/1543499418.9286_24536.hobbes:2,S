The appropriate uses of goto are rare enough that it's good practice to
avoid it where reasonable.. My claim about reliability is that it's
correlated with readability and maintainability.
And I don't believe removing gotos from VFS is as hard as you say. Almost
all of the code is of the form
foo(<vars>)
{
....
	if(something_bad)
		goto fail;
....
fail:
	/* do cleanup */
}
...with lots of failure modes. These can	be trivially transformed to:
foo(<vars>)
{
	int cleanup_var;
	if(!bar(<vars>,&cleanup_var))
		/* do cleanup */
}
int bar(...)
{
	int local_vars_we_don't_need_to_clean_up;
	...
	if(something_bad)
		return 0;
	...
	return 1; /* success */
}
Throw inline in front of foo_attempt() and you do away with the call
overhead. I'm not presenting this as an ideal approach, just an existence
proof that eliminating gotos is not necessarily hard, nor need it result
in ridiculous nesting. It may in fact result in smaller and simpler
functions.
