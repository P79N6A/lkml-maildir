I tested 2.4.0 on probably the exact same box - an Olivetti M300-05 
386sx with 5MB and it came up ok, except that memory detection is off
by a MB. (to be fixed in 2.4.1 or boot with mem= argument in 2.4.0)
What might be important here is your gcc & binutils (as/gas) version,
combined with a miscompile in something like __verify_write that
doesn't get used on anything but 386 (and hence went undetected).
Only thing strange on my box is that the kernel is compiled with 
gcc-2.7.2 which is officially unsupported but can be managed if you 
know what the gcc bugs are.  
Paul.
