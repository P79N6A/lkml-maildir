There is no one maintainer. I did some of the documentation and buffering
abstraction. Paul Fulghum wrote the SMP aware and clever locking bits
for the buffer handling. Since then other people have worked on the 
reference locking and the current->tty races and fixed those

As of 2.6.19-rc I think the majority of the big issues are sorted

Untrue - many serial drivers support being consoles

Close/Write cannot occur in parallel. The VFS guarantees this

See the existing drivers. Open can use spinlocks
