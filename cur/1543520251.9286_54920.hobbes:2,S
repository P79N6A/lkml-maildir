Maybe so, but why don't we put Quake into the kernel, too?  You would get
great performance, but something like that simply belongs in user space. I
don't think Linux deserves the benchmarks it gets if it cheats to get
them.  We shouldn't let politics allow us to employ bad design (If a
registry ala Windows was a performance issue, would we use it?  No,
because it makes a mess of everything). 
An HTTP server is something that should be in a patch, not the main kernel
tree.  (Heck, software suspend and the PC-speaker driver should go in
before khttpd does.)
