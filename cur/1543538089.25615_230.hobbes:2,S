That is what I'm doing in patches #2&3... looking at current to see if the
processor that has the lock is trying to reaquire it.  Now I'm not
shooting for a "prevent all recursive uses of console_lock" tactic, but
that could be an easy extension... and it might just make sense.  I'm not
sure if using current is the right way to detect this... but I _think_
it's okay?  :)

Yeah, just "dropping" messages without any indication that something
happened is baaaad... :)

That is possible... but "what is enough"  if it could reenter 1 time,
what's to prevent it from reentering 2 times?  I don't think this solution
would really be accepted...

or
4: Count failed attempts to print and print that number out during the
next successful printk.  This has the advantage that the user knows that
_SOMETHING_ happened... but also that execution can continue and move
on...  This is the technique my patch #3 uses...
