Well, not my decision, or yours I think.  wli?  akpm?
But I don't see that recording all the mapped ranges will avoid the
need for the fault serialization.  At least the version of apw's
reservation patch I looked at most recently would certainly still
suffer from the alloc/instantiate race on the last hugepage in the
system.  This is a different bug from that addressed by reservation
(of whichever form).
