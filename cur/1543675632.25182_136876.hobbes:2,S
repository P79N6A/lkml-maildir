Interesting point.  The original do_no_page() API does this
as well:
	static int
	do_no_page(struct mm_struct *mm, struct vm_area_struct *vma,
		   unsigned long address, int write_access, pte_t *page_table, pmd_t *pmd)
As does do_anonymous_page().  I assumed that there were corner
cases where this one-to-one correspondence did not exist, but
must confess that I did not go looking for them.
Or is this a performance issue, avoiding a dereference and
possible cache miss?
					Thanx, Paul
