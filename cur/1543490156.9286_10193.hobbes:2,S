I guess I'm missing something in this discussion -- what is the
bus abstraction and how is it accessed?  Things can get "strange" when you
have multiple (many?) PCI buses and have to deal with mapping I/O space,
memory space and address translation from 32bit PCI into 64 bit memory
space especially when some of the PCI bus bridges expect (allow?) the mapping
to be dynamic (for DMA).
I don't know about mapping the bus/port pair into 32 bits, but that's only
part of the problem.  I also don't know what's encoded in the upper 16
bits, but you may run out of bits quickly given that some enterprise
server systems can have dozens of PCI busses (not slots!) especially if
you're encoding other information into the upper 16bits.
