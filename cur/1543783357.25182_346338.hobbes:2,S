That's on point of view.  In my experience, it simplifies debugging to
make sure the unit is at the latest firmware, since bugs in the
enclosure's IDE driver could be causing the problem.  As I said
before, when my enclosure was upgraded, all my problems went away.  
So that's why I was asking you to make sure your firmware was upto
date.  Is that so hard to understand?

Sure it can make a difference.  If the enclosure puts out crap signals
on the USB bus when it's powered up, and the older versions of the
Linux kernel dealt with them because of an oversight, but now we're
closer to the USB specs... it could the issue.  
In any case, it's a *simple* test to do, unless you're not physically
at the system with this device, or if you can't be bothered to:
1. unplug enclosure from USB.
2. power it off.
3. power it on.
4. wait 30 seconds.
5. plug in the USB cable.
6. what happens?
That tells us useful stuff.

That will help people debug this for sure.
In any case, I'm not going to be much help from here on.
