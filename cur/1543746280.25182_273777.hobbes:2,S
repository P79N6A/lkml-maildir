the max CPU load i get here is 46% (your laptop is faster), but no
xruns. The result of a 5-minute run is:

i suspect i need to activate some option/define in jackd to get some of
the more advanced stats such as delay-maximum?
the kernel i used was -30-6 and i used the snd-via82xx driver. (I had to
do -n3 instead of -n2 when starting up jackd - otherwise i'd get an
endless stream of very small xruns, apparently a via82xx driver bug?)
