Well, you can do that with my bug database - just open a new bug
report for each compile failiure, upload a patch to the database, and
link the patch with the new bug.  You can then collect together all
the relevant bug reports in to a confirmed bug for each kernel
version. You don't even have to duplicate bug reports if they occur in
multiple kernel versions.
John.
