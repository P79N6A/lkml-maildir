Along the lines of this patch, can I ask... if a patch were created to
replace all instances of "extern inline" with "static inline" would
that be a good thing or a waste of time? I found a 3 year old thread
(Jul 27 2001, "Re: [PATCH] gcc-3.0.1 and 2.4.7-ac1") where it sounded
like a good thing to do, but obviously there are some still around.
