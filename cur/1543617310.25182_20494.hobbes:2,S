Klaus,
Have you tried 2.4.18pre2aa2 from:
ftp://ftp.de.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.18pre2aa2.bz2
With this patch applied:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=101110373911359&w=2
I get better performance with it, but I've only used it on
a machine with 1GB ram.
