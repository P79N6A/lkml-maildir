Linux is already shipping with a software watchdog. When enabled it wants
a regular write from a user mode daemon to a special character device. 
When the write doesn't happen after some time it'll reboot.
The only problem is when it was crashing with interrupts off. At least on
machines with a global APIC (=usually SMP) there is a NMI watchdog in 2.4 
that triggers an oops after some time of interruptless spinning.
It only works on SMP build.
I would suggest to recommend configuring the software watchdog before 
running any critical tests.  The test procedure could also use a simple
log mechanism (write a START TEST record to a log file, fsync it) and 
a restart mechanism that tries to figure out any crashes so they can 
be logged.
