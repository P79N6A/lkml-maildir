Yes, now we're on the same page, so to speak.  Personally, I don't have much 
interest in working on improving the allocator per se.  I'd love to see 
somebody else take a run at that, and I will occupy myself with the gritty 
details of how to move pages without making the system crater.

I don't see that it's guaranteed, but I do see that organizing pages in 
slab-like chunks is a good thing to do - a close reading of my original 
response to you shows I was thinking about that.
I also don't see that the slab cache in its current incarnation is the right 
tool for the job.  It handles things that we just don't need to handle, such 
as objects of arbitary size and alignment.  I'm sure you could make it work, 
but why not just tweak alloc_pages to know about chunks instead?

Daniel
