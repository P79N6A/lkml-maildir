OK here are some facts ;)
I run hdparm but only after syslogd... so hdparm isn't the bad boy
I have 3 partitions. Two reiserfs partitions, one mounted on /, one on /home
One ext2 /boot partition
The oops happens in 3 of 4 tests on syslogd. Only devfsd is loaded before it.
The other time it happens when loading proftpd. This is one of the last processes I started by the boot scripts
It happens with the IDE layer version as in the dj tree and with acb-io-2.5.3-p2.01212002 update (why haven't you included this in your tree, Dave?)
I have really no idea the oops comes from
