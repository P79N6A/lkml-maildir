I have some AOpen 52x/32x CD-RWriter, that advertises itself as DMA capable, 
but has a hard time sustaining such access.  The only way to make access to 
this drive safe is by reducing it to PIO-3 even on XP,  which makes libata 
somewhat unusable on this drive, especially for writing.
What's hindering the ability to force a mode in libata, as is possible with 
the normal ide-driver?
Thanks!
