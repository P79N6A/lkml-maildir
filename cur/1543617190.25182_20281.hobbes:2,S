This is not true, and if it is is a scheduler bug.  When a task (any
task) gets preempted it is not moved from the front of its queue, thus,
in this case, the FIFO task will still be the fitst task at its prioity
to run.  Also, it can only be preempted by another real time task of
higher priority.  Now it is possible that that task may block on the
same sem, but this is simple priority inversion and has nothing to do
with the sem holder being FIFO, RR or any thing else.  In other words
preemption does NOT change a FIFO (or any other) task's position in the
dispatch queue.
