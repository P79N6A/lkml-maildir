"Unused" as in "->d_count==0"? That _is_ OK. Basically, you will have
positive ->d_count only on directories and currently opened files.
E.g. during compile in /usr/include/* you will have 3-5 file dentries
with ->d_count > 0 - ones that are opened _now_. It doesn't mean that
everything else rest is unused in any meaningful sense. Can be freed - yes,
but that's a different story.
If you are talking about "unused" from the slab POV - _ouch_. Looks like
extremely bad fragmentation ;-/ It's surprising, and if that's thte case
I'd like to see more details.
