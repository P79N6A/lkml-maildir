Does this mean that if I have /a/b/ and /c/d/ unionised under /mnt/union, I
am not allowed to alter anything under /a/b/ and /c/d/?  That I may only
alter stuff under /mnt/union?
If so, that sounds like a significant limitation.

With a rather rough user interface ;)
Also, is it possible to add new branches to an existing union mount?  And
to take old ones away?
