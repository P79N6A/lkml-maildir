Over the last three years, we've uncovered (and fixed) dozens of 
device driver bugs that were only detected because of the pci error
detection hardware.  The ability to get device dumps is important,
because many of these bugs are hard to reproduce, require getting
PCI bus analyzers attached to the system, etc.

Right. As a result, we only care about the products that we actually 
sell to customers. PCI error recovery is not some "gee its nice" piece
of eye-candy or chrome: either one is serious about high-availability,
or one is not.
