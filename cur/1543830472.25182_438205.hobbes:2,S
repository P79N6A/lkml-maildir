No, the point is that these devices have no driver associated with them.
They are "class" devices, and as such, are virtual.
Hm, well, I guess I should go add the suspend callbacks to the class, as
Linus's core changes is going to be expecting that...
Anyway, for virtual devices, it often times makes no sense to have a
suspend function, and as such, they should not be required to provide a
null function...
