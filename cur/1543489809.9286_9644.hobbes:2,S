Hello!
> David, Alexey, what do you think? 
At first sight, this fix does not change anything essentially.
inet_wait_for_connect cannot sleep on socket with sk->err.
sk->error_report() wakes up it after sk->err set, so that
the event cannot be lost.
BTW checks for sk->protocol == IPPROTO_TCP in this function are redundant.
It is inet_stream_connect() specially for TCP.
