Subject: [PATCH libata-2.6] AHCI: fix fatal error int handling
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I noticed that the AHCI CI (cmd issue) reg wasn't getting cleared
after error ints resulting in no further commands being successfully
issued to the port.  This patch fixes.  All that's really needed is
the 1's complement but I also removed the disabling/enabling of the
FIS_RX b/c this isn't spec'd as necessary when handling error ints.
