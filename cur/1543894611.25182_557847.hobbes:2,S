The signing key determines a critical portion of the binary form that
was distributed.  You cannot produce that portion of the binary form
without the signing key.  Without that portion, the binary form does
not perform the function for which it is distributed.  If you think
such an input is not part of "the preferred form for modification", I
have a bridge to sell you.
The work that the GPL protects a recipient's right to modify and
redistribute is not the source code -- it is each form the user
receives.

Section 12 of the GPL(v2) is a warranty and liability disclaimer.  It
is not an absolution of license obligations.  It limits the liability
of a distributor to the end user, not to copyright owners.
