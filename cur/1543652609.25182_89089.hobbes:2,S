If those messages look like "no handle slots, this should not happen" and
you're running a 2.4.x kernel there's a known problem with the qlogicfc
driver locking up the machine under high load. It's been fixed in 2.5,
but I don't think it's been back-ported yet.
So, aside from the _other_ problems induced by shared storage, this might
be biting you too. :)
