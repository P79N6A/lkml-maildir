New informations. I tested more kernels.
2.4.21 and 22 with 2 CPUs are slow as hell. When I reboot
with maxcpus=1 then all is suddenly ok.
Also floppy drive was not detected in 2 CPU config while
with maxcpus=1 it is.
I placed lmbench data and dmesg output to
http://luxik.cdi.cz/~devik/tmp/slow-smp/
 in case someone
knows what to do.
I can do some other tests if you want me to do them.
thanks,
devik
