Dear all, 
since using kernel 2.0.37 on our linux server, the squid web cache
delivers many webpages incompletely to a netscape running __on the
same box__:
   "An error occured while netscape was receiving data: Connection
    reset by peer."
No problems at all with 2.0.36, 2.0.36Suse, 2.2.8, 2.2.9.
After hitting reload everything seems to be working. 
Also, no problems with web browsers on other hosts of the LAN.
Squid Cache version 2.0.PATCH2 as delivered with SuSE 6.0;
Netscape® Communicator 4.5; more details on request. 
best wishes,
Andreas
