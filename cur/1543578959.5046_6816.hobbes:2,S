Hi,
I recently got this in my logs after moving /home to reiserfs. It is a plain
2.4.1-pre7 SMP system (.config attached).
Jan 16 19:15:02 narayan kernel: journal_begin called without kernel lock held
Jan 16 19:15:02 narayan kernel: kernel BUG at journal.c:423!
Jan 16 19:15:02 narayan kernel: CPU:   0
I seem to remember more possibly useful information scrolling by my screen,
but it seems to not have made it to the logs, and I will shut down and fsck
the filesystem now...
Regards,
