I'm not an expert in this, but one thing is that the more memory the system has, the more overhead there is.
(roughly 64 bytes per 4Kb of memory).

yes this is expected.
Let me explain: even though you have 4Gb of memory, it's spread out like this:
0     - 3.5Gb	Memory
3.5Gb - 4Gb  	Gap
4Gb   - 4.5Gb   Memory
This "gap" is needed for PCI. PCI devices have "memory" on them (technical term is "MMIO", memory mapped IO) and
this needs to be in the first 4Gb of memory (traditionally). So the system leaves a 0.5Gb gap on your system
for this purpose.
Some other systems have 0.25Gb or 1Gb gaps; some systems even have a BIOS option for the size of this gap.
But a gap.. all machines with >= 4Gb have that.
Just enable PAE and be done with it. (And you get the non-executable stack security feature as well then)
