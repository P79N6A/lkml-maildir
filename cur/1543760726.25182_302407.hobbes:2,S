Ugh ...
Since there are already various umask settings done by various
/etc/*profile* and /etc/*init* scripts that head up various logins and
task families, this means that the default visibility of tasks in ps and
top will change.  I predict confusion and frustration, when people don't
know why portions of ps or top output are suppressed.
And even when they figure it out, you don't give them anyway to get back
to the previous state - of visibility in ps, top and pstree, but file
creation permissions masked off in some way.
Nice small patch ... but I don't like overloading umask with this.
