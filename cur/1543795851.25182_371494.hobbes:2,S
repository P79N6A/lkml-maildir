I happen to have an old program which uses RDTSC frequently for timing 
purposes.  That seemed like a good idea at the time, but I guess it 
should be updated.  The question is, what replacement is there?  I don't 
want to have to use a syscall every 50 instructions or so.  Feel free to 
laugh, but suggesting a workable replacement might be more helpful.
