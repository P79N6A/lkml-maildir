Thanks for the update.
I wonder if there are several problems.  Alan Cox claimed that there was 
a fix in linux-2.6.10-ac10 that might alleviate the problem.
On linux-2.6.10-ac10 I've got one machine that's been up for 6 days now 
that would never last more then 1 before.  On the other hand I have one 
machine that did die after two days.
Does linux-2.6.11-rc2 have both the linux-2.6.10-ac10 fix and the xattr 
problem fixed?  If so, I'll test there.
