Eh? ide_timer_expiry is the timer handler called if a interrupt timeout
occurs.

That's nonsense too. I added the expiry hook to let lower levels decide
what should happen when an interrupt timeout occurs. So there's been
_no_ interrupt if we enter this from the timer handler.

Right, it was added to handle long commands like format unit etc.

I don't know what tangent you are going off on here, I think you should
re-read this code a lot more carefully. There's no polling going on
here.
