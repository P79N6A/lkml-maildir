Never tried the 2.2 series with this controller - probably should get
around to doing that this weekend. :S

Uptime proves nothing alas; I could get 30+ days if I wanted :S

The problem is not one of lockups. The system in question doesn't lock;
it doesn't crash; it doesn't even log anything at the time - not even
APIC errors.
Instead it quietly and silently corrupts exactly four bytes at a time;
mostly on the last four bytes of a 4096 block...
I can most easily cause the corruption by copying a large amount of
known data across the disk, and then checking for differences:
cp -aR /usr/src/linux /usr/src/l2 ; diff -dur /usr/src/linux /usr/src/l2
When it does corrupt in this manner, it is not so much of a concern - I
can detect, delete, and recopy the corrupted file(s).
What is more worrying is, what if it is quietly silently and happily
corrupting other data - when I'm NOT staring at it with a paranoid
concern; for example, compiling binaries; or altering large data
files...
As such, I cannot at this time reduce the problem to one of Software or
Hardware Error; and while it is A Major Problem in my eyes; I avoid it
currently by not using the hpt366 controller :)
