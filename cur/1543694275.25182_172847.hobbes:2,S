The check of:
	if (dev->bus->number == bus && dev->devfn == devfn)
in pci_find_slot() doesn't check for the domain?

Ah, nice.  After telling you I would not accept this patch right now,
until after 2.6.0 comes out, you send it to Linus.  Really appreciate
that...
Anyway, is there any other way you can fix this in the tg3 driver only
for right now?  I agree adding the pci function is "cleaner", but a bit
late for right now.

How does this differ from pci_find_slot()?  (becides the pci_dev_get()
call)?  pci_find_slot() asks for the bus number, which can be determined
from the pci_bus structure, right?
