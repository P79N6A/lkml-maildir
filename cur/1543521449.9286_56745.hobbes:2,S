This is one of the several cases that point out the code currently fails
to backspeed and maximize throughput.  This is a minor issue and would not
stop it from moving to "supported"!
IBM-DJNA-352030, 19470MB w/1966kB Cache, CHS=2482/255/63, (U)DMA
This is an ATA-66 drive that has been cripped to ATA-2 and corrected to
ATA-33.  This can be fixed like I fixed the cmd646 code.
This I am willing to move it to supported because it behaves well and only
needs to be taught a few more tricks.
Second explaination about WDC drives defaulting to DMA mode 2 and all UDMA
modes disabled, this is an OEM solution!  The folks at ALI had suggested
and made the code default disable WDC devices regardless of UDMA
capablities.
