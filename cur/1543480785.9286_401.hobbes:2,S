Windows doesn't see the drive or the partition, so it didn't
get to the filesystem.

I thought it was mild:(

It happened once befor on a different drive but still /var.
So I moved it. the other disk is still fine and this one
was before. I can't force it to happen at will, but it
has happened before.

I agree

No. The previous time was a different CPU.
Not overclocked.
I need a way to recover the data. I need the logs and info
for RPM. I don't have enough room to backup and reinstall,
then restore my changes. 
Anyone know the ext2fs well enough to help?
