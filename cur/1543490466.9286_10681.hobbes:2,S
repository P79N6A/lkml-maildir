  Hello.
  I've send this to fs-devel list but because nobody replied I'm also sending it to
linux-kernel (and I'm adding a few thigs I came accross today ;-)...
  I've decided to read dcache and inode cache code and I found a few things which I didn't
understood (or they are bugs ;-)?). I was reading code from 2.2.1 as I think it didn't
differ much from current kernels... Here are the questions:
  1) In dcache.c in select_parent() there is a test d_count == 0 and immediately after it
     is a test to d_subdirs being nonempty which I think can never pass when d_count == 0...
  2) In namei.c in do_follow_link() when everything is OK only variable dentry is dput() but
     but variable base not (in other cases these variable is dput()...) but
     in lookup_dentry() from which this function is called the variable base is overwritten
     but old dentry isn't dput... Do I miss something?
  3) In inode.c in sync_one() when inode is locked the function only waits for it to unlock
     and then silently exits. Shouldn't it also write the inode if needed?
  4) In the same function when inode is written it is unlocked and the processes from wait
     queue are run but this is done with inode_lock held. I don't thing this is desirable...
  
New things:
  5) In dqput() there is a test whether the dquot is already on the free list (OK, when
     everything is right it shouldn't) and when it isn't a warning is printed but then
     the dquot is added to the list happily again. Also when dquot is put on the free
     list a wake_up is called but the dquot has use count == 0 so the queue should be
     free, shouldn't it?
  6) Function isize_to_blocks is a bit... say strange. It does count indirect blocks but
     who has said us the filesystem use them. Also when we count indirect blocks we should
     at least consider blksize. But I agree this is a minor problem because this function
     is never called (at least I think it because ext2 counts blocks itself and other
     filesystems doesn't have quotas..). But maybe just returning size/blocksize could be
     better.
  7) I see nothing which prevents races in dquot_transfer(). When we are gathering the quotas
     to move we can block and nothing prevents someone else from changing the dquots under
     us so that assumptions we have from tests might not be valid when updating structures...
     Also someone (ie invalidate_dquots() can dqput() the dquots we have...).
  8) There is a buffer overrun in get_filesystem_info(). We are putting informations about
     mounts to the given page and we expect the length of one entry can't exceed 160 bytes
     which is a bit optimistic because we store also a mountpoint into the buffer...
  If some of the mentioned things are bugs I can fix them. I just didn't want to make fixes
to something which is right but I didn't understood it ;-).
						Looking forward to your answers
