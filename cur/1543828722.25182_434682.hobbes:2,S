I think it implies exactly the opposite.
In any case, the length of this thread answers your question from earlier:
No, I won't fix bug 6719 as part of this patch.  It's a completely
unrelated issue and the problem is ill-defined.  It's also something
that's infinitely arguable.
The original patch is simple and fixes one problem: that architecture
people are supposed to learn about LSF and LBD when it really has no
effect on their architecture.
