Exactly. The trick is with majors like 0 where minors are different
devices. Dispatching the callbacks becomes a bit uglier (a mask for the
minor field?). For 2.3 we might have enough major numbers to make this a
non-issue, though. 
Turning code like switch blocks into data is generally a big win (except
in performance critical cases like reading an IP header). It becomes much
easier for the maintainer to make structural changes and global
optimizations and the code becomes shorter, simpler, and more readable.
And possibly faster.
