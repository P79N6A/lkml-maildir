Hmmm, how does it get the correct return-value and type? I don't
think that a compiler is allowed to change the function(s) called.
If gcc is doing this now, there are many potential problems and
it needs to be fixed. For instance, one can't qualify a
'C' runtime library and then have a compiler decide that it's
not going to call the pre-qualified function.
