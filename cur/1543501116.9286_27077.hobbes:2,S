	I've yet to have any problems w/ anything in the 2.2.x series...
Different people/configurations are of varying stabilities, of course...

	I've yet to have any FS corruption under 2.2.10, and I believe
they've got a hold of that particular bug, though I didn't hear about it
in 2.2.10 as much as in 2.3.x...  Though I don't always follow very
closely. ;)

	Changes generally get incorportated in both branches...

	Well, report any problems you do have... :)
