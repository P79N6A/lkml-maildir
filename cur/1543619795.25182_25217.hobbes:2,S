Sure it's a hub (with the firmware provided by Linux :) but it's also a
PCI device.  The extra indirection is the one which makes the root
hub be a different device than the PCI device.  It'll have some
attributes that relate to its PCI device role, others that relate to
the more specialized "USB root hub" role.

Not useful to this user ... and I'm unclear why it'd be useful to
any others.  Initialization order can change, and embedding
it in device naming is basically just trouble.

Just like most directories.  That's why I commented that it might
be desirable to have any typing information just show up as one
of the directory attributes.
