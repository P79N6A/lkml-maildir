I disagree.  From an embedded viewpoint it would be nice to have a 
"please free up memory", then a "we really need memory NOW", then 
finally the kernel oom killer.
The advantage of the middle message is that it allows userspace to do 
smarter things if it wants to (for instance, if there is an overall 
system manager or some such thing, it could do a better job of 
restarting tasks than the kernel oom killer since it knows the relative 
importance of tasks).
