I meant: that IF I'm right that there needs to be more pci_dev_put, 
that needs to be noted in the source. 
If you know that there needs to be a put, but you have decided you
don't know where to put it exactly, then that needs to be in a comment
so that someone looking at the code after you will be able to put it
in. Otherwise the new person will think: He might have had a smarter
plan and will do the pci_dev_put somewhere else.

Does it sit on the couch all day? Is it unemployed? Please be specific!
