There is another nasty in multi-port arrays that I should perhaps point out:  
a bus reset isn't supposed to drop the reservation if it was taken on another 
port.  A device or LUN reset will drop reservations on all ports.  This 
behaviour, although clearly mandated by the SCSI-3-SPC, is rather patchily 
implemented in arrays and I have seen some multi-port arrays that will, 
illegally, drop reservations on all ports on receipt of a bus reset.
Unfortunately, most Linux SCSI drivers won't issue device resets on command, 
they'll only issue bus resets, so it is possible to get into a situation where 
you cannot break a reservation belonging to a dead machine, if you set up a 
point-to-point cluster rather than a true shared-scsi one.
