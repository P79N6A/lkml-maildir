A standard kernel image assumes that its boot sector was loaded off of a
floppy, and attempts to load the remainder of the kernel.  I patched the
setup code to work when netbooted, but I lost the source. :( However, if
you want a copy of the bootsector, I can send you one (and maybe
disassemble/recreate the source).
