But that isn't actually syntactically correct code is it?  You have types
as parameters like a function declaration, but no return type.  So there
is no hint to checkpatch that this is a function declaration and therefore
the parameters are not expected to be types, nor are they checked as such.
The following diff is clean on the latest version of checkpatch:

Could you try out the version of checkpatch at the URL below on the real
patch you are using to test, and let me know if it works.  There are
a number of improvements to type tracking in the face of ifdef's and
the like.  If it doesn't could I have the hunk which fails:
