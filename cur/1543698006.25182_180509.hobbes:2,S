It appears that the build process for the parport.o and parport_pc.o kernel
modules is not properly picking up the value of 'CONFIG_PARPORT_1284'.  Even
though my .config file contains 'CONFIG_PARPORT_1284=y', a build of the kernel
does not successfully include IEEE1284 support, as evidenced by this message
in the system log file:
kernel: parport: IEEE1284 not supported in this kernel
I was able to generate a simple workaround, which I verified works, by adding 
a "#define" to the relevant source code in drivers/parport/.  I would have
preferred to have found the actual build problem, but I must admit to not being
able to completely decipher the build process...sorry.
I am not sure if this is relevant, but you will notice that my entire parallel
port support is via modules. The rest of the relevant entrys from .config:
#
# Parallel port support
#
CONFIG_PARPORT=m
CONFIG_PARPORT_PC=m
CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_CML1=m
# CONFIG_PARPORT_SERIAL is not set
# CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_FIFO is not set
# CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_SUPERIO is not set
CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_PCMCIA=m
# CONFIG_PARPORT_AMIGA is not set
# CONFIG_PARPORT_MFC3 is not set
# CONFIG_PARPORT_ATARI is not set
# CONFIG_PARPORT_GSC is not set
# CONFIG_PARPORT_SUNBPP is not set
# CONFIG_PARPORT_OTHER is not set
CONFIG_PARPORT_1284=y
