I guess Pat's code has something to do with a resource allocation
(haven't seen it though).
I would play with following if I have the hardware:
{
	pci_do_scan_bus(bus);
	pbus_size_bridges(bus);
	pbus_assign_resources(bus);
}
Obviously, __init qualifiers should be changed to __devinit for pbus_*
and other stuff in setup-bus.c and setup-res.c.
Ivan.
