Yes indeed.  I wish I could point you to the exact patch containing the 
fix, but the git software seems to have lost track of it (it's combined
in with a large number of other patches with no obvious way to separate 
it out).  It's also available in the various mailing list archives, but 
I don't have a pointer to it and there's no reasonable way to search 
for it.
The patch in question was written by Matthew Wilcox; it added code to 
the SCSI async-scanning routines to utilize the scan_mutex.  IMO it 
should have been applied to 2.6.23 but it wasn't.
