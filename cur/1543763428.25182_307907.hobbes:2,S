Messages that are passed between agents must have only id,
but I decided to force people to use provided seq/ack fields
to store there some information about message order.
Neither kernel nor userspace requires that fields to be 
somehow initialized.

skbs are delivered in softirq context and, yes,
I need to exactly point that sending also must be limited to soft irq
context.

Callback is invoked each time message is received - either 
from userspace [original aim] or from kernelspace
[one can send notification request or just send a message from one 
kernelspace subsystem to another].
Callback can also be called when notification for given idx/val range
was requested and new callback is being registered/unregistered 
which mathces given idx/val range.

I will begin create in-code documentation after all technical issues 
are resolved. Patches will be ready soon I think.
