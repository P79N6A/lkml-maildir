Hi all,
OK, I checked again with him.  It turns out there was some confusion.
He does read in *1024* byte chunks after all (accessing /dev/hdX
directly) ..
But I still need to do 512 byte chunks myself (*).
I understand that this can be done with the the raw device construction ?
Would it also be possible to change the device blocksize with a BLKBSZSET
ioctl() to 512 and do 512 byte transfers after that ?
	greetings,

*: you might wonder why I'm so obsessed with 512 transfers ..
   The reason is that I'm working with a USB device (driver) that
   dies when there is too much CompactFlash IDE access (because
   of data-records logged to the CF).  I want to have the absolute
   minimum amount of disk-access.
