I'm a little bit worried about this patch.  Have you tried something
like NFS-over-ext3-over-LVM-over-MD or so, which can have a deep stack?
We hit a bunch of deep stack problems like this (overflowing an 8kB stack)
even without interrupts involved when developing Lustre.  Granted, we
fixed some large stack allocations in the ext3 indexed-directory code
and in our own code, but I'm still worried that a 4kB stack is too small.
The Stanford checker folks would probably be able to run a test for
large stack allocations in 2.5.40 if you asked them nicely, and maybe
even do stack depths for call chains.
Alternately, you could set up an 8kB stack + IRQ stack and "red-zone"
the high page of the current 8kB stack and see if it is ever used.
Cheers, Andreas
