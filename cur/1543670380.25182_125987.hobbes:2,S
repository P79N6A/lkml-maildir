Seems that the VT8235 has some issues with ac97 recording.  Using aumix,
and setting the input to line-in, cat /dev/dsp returns the same byte over
and over again, as if there is no signal.  Dumping this file and dumping
back to /dev/dsp confirms the silence - no sound got record.  Messing
around with the mixer doesn't appear to do much.  The mixer subsystem, I
can control the volume of line-in and line-out, and hear the volume going
up and down.  I also tried Windows, seems it works fine in Windows.
I tried the same command sequence on my SiS735 (i810-compatible) AC97
machine and the results differ (it works :-)  So it seems that there's
something that's wrong with the kt8235 side of things?
Playback works fine.  Just cannot record.  Is the kt8235 driver not quite
primetime yet?
Thanks,
