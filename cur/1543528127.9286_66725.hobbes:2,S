From the rwhod manpage:
     If the -b flag is supplied, only broadcast interfaces, such as ethernets,
     will be used.  If the -p flag is supplied, only point-to-point interfaces
     will be used. If the -a flag is supplied, or no flags are supplied, all
     interfaces will be used.
So you'd want to use the -b flag.  I've done this at home to keep rwho
broadcasts from going out my ppp dialup.
