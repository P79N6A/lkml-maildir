Won't the Linux kernel include the ppscsi and all it's drivers on it?
I have this scanner (ColorPage EP) that uses the Adaptec SCSI emulation 
on the parallel port and I'm using kernel 2.4, which is doing fine with 
the patch I got from the net for this specific series.
But I'm worried because I'm thinking of going up to 2.6 and that the 
patch will be incompatible.
Why such an old driver used by so many people can't be included on the 
source, even on the 2.4 series?
Thanks,
