So my question stands:  What is the _recommended_ way to handle  
simple data types in low-bandwidth/frequency multiple-valued  
transactions to hardware?  Examples include reading/modifying  
framebuffer settings (currently done through IOCTLS), s390 current  
state (up for discussion), etc.  In these cases there needs to be an  
atomic snapshot or write of multiple values at the same time.  Given  
the situation it would be _nice_ to use sysfs so the admin can do it  
by hand; makes things shell scriptable and reduces the number of  
binary compatibility issues.
Cheers,
