Timothy,
I am truly sorry about the concern this has caused, have already 
publicly apologized for not submitting a patch to properly correct the 
issue when the workaround was implemented, and proposed a change to the 
modem drivers that should go in as soon as possible to restore tainting 
and one instance of the warning messages while avoiding the flood.
At the same time, I think that the "community" should, without 
relinquishing its principles, be less eager before getting the facts to 
attack people and companies trying to help in good faith, and be more 
realistic when it comes to satisfying practical needs of ordinary 
users.
Sincerely
Marc
