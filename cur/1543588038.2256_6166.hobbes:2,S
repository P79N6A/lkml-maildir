Hallo,
I'm in the middle of some interesting conversation at work WRT ext2's
fitness for 'production' use.
The crux of my question, if anyone out there is familiar with the SpecSFS
benchmark, is whether or not ext2 can be benchmarked under an nfs mount
exported with the 'sync' option.
If not, do the O_SYNC patches qualify ext2 for the level of syncronous
writes that SpecSFS requires?
Opinions?
Thanks!
