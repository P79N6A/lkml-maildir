As this stands, it's rather scary.
- it will quietly break when cryptoapi gets fiddled with
- it subverts the module reference counting rules
- for a given cipher/digest, tfm_size might be large
Subverting the API this way is bad. On the other hand, I tend to think
the API does need a way to deal with problem cases like these, so I'd
support extending the API in some fashion to handle it. Related (but
not identical) issues have cropped up with a few other things that
want to avoid serializing around a single or per-cpu context.
Something like:
 /* calculate the size of a tfm so that users can manage their own
 copies */
 int crypto_alg_size(const char *name);
 /* copy a TFM to a user-managed buffer, possibly on stack, with proper
 internal reference counting and any other necessary magic, size checks
 against boneheaded buffer sizing */
 crypto_copy_tfm(char *dst, const struct crypto_tfm *src, int size);
 /* do all the necessary bookkeeping to release a user-managed TFM, use
 char pointer to avoid alloc/free mismatch */
 crypto_copy_cleanup_tfm(char *usertfm);
James, thoughts?
