Running fsync in data=ordered means that all of the dirty blocks on the FS 
will get written before fsync returns.  Your original stack trace shows 
everyone either performing writeback for a log commit or waiting for the log 
commit to return.
They key task in your trace is kjournald, stuck in get_request_wait.  It could 
be a block layer bug, not giving him requests quickly enough, or it could be 
the scheduler not giving him back the cpu fast enough.
At any rate, that's where to concentrate the debugging.  You should be able to 
simulate this by running a few instances of the below loop and looking for 
stalls:
while(true) ; do
    time dd if=/dev/zero of=foo bs=50M count=4 oflags=sync    
done
