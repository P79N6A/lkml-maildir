Hi Chris,
It seems correct to update the "old_inode" inode ctime on rename().
The "mark_inode_dirty(old_inode)" in your patch does not seem to be
necessary because ext2_dec_count() will do it.
2.6 also does not update the ctime on rename() AFAICS. Lets get it fixed
there first.
Andrew, viro, anyone?
