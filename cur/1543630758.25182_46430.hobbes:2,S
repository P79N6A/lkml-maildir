Using the old i8259 interrupts controller, my 1-way Linux2.4.16 box 
livelocks when receiving a high rate UDP flow (interrupt rate is so 
high that the NET_RX_SOFTIRQ never gets the chance to pull the 
packets off the backlog queue). However, the receive livelock 
phenomenom completely disappears when making use of the IO-APIC. 
Anyone has an explanation for this?
THX.
