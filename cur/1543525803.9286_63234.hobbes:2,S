Subject: NFS Locking in 2.3

Is there NFS file locking support in the current 2.3 kernel? After
downloading all the latest NFS utilities, with 2.3.44, when loading
rpc.lockd, I get: lockdsvc: Invalid argument
I'm assuming that this is not an isolated case. If there is no support in
the current kernel, are there any plans for it?
