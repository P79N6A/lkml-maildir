Yes it does.
When loading the controller, these are some of the messages:
	PM: Adding info for usb:1-1:0
	PM: Adding info for usb:1-1:1
	drivers/usb/class/cdc-acm.c: need inactive config #2
	drivers/usb/class/cdc-acm.c: need inactive config #2
On loading cdc_acm:
	usb 1-1: control timeout on ep0in
When I do the echo 2 >/sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1/bConfigurationValue:
	acm: probe of 1-1:1 failed with error -5
I am able to open the modem device and use it after the echo, and not
before.  (I'm using it now).

So many other things don't work automatically for me in 2.6 that one
little echo for cdc_acm is a little thing.  Besides, hotplug doesn't
work either - something about the arguments to /sbin/hotplug has
changed since 2.4 and I am in no rush to install a new version.
Thanks for the modem fix.  I can now test the futex bug without going
offline :)
Cheers,
