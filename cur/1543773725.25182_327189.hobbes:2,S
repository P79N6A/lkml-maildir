Rik, it would certainly fail miserably on any architecture where different
CPU's have any CPU local memory under kernel managment.
Anything resembling the old homogeneous Hydra scheme should be fine though I
would think.
NUMA is odd enough that the kernel is littered with conditionals for it, one
more wouldn't be a big deal ;->
I'll try to code this up and benchmark it and see if there's anything
measurable.  If there is, this sort of simple minded "cache the last one"
scheme might be applicable elsewhere too - pipes, maybe net packets, etc.
It looks like Slab already sort of "caches the last one" on the different
granularities, but it takes a bit more code to get to the point where it
finally figures out it can give you back a cached one.
Maybe there's something to be gained by having an internal special case
allocator for limited numbers of small things (like 32, 64, 128, 256 maybe
where a bit scan instruction or two can trivially find you an empty slot)?
Where the allocator degenerates to just setting a flag byte on the smaller
slices and generating the pointer from a bit index.
