That won't work very well - if SPARC wants 2.91.66 then
we need to support that compiler on x86 as well.  So that
people won't use later-supported compiler features.  And
because many compiler bugs are platform-independent, so
they will be detected (and worked around) on x86.
wrt the __func__ thing: is it possible to do:
#if (compiler version test)
#define __FUNCTION__ __func__
#endif
to kill the 3.x warning?
