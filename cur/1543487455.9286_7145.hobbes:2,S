There is life beyond the official kernel distribution. So many things
can be built as modules and don't need to be in the kernel.
I'm more than happy if some of my stuff lives on sunsite and at least
some people like it.
Use Linus kernel if you like his way of keeping an extremely high standard.
Use somebody else's kernel if need certain features (-ac comes to mind..).
I guess it takes some getting used to hearing "I'll never allow that"
which might mean "maybe we both try if there might be a better way" - agreed.
But I still preferr that to standards being set too low.

Microsoft does have a year 2000 problem. I'm part of it. I'm running Linux.
