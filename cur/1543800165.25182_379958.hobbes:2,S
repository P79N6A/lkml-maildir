Unfortunately, that one _is_ documented.  BS they've pulled with macro
arguments ("if you have ( in it, forget about sanity and just quote")
is not, but I'm afraid that the only real way to deal with that
properly is to do as(1) from scratch for targets we care about and
make sure it produces binaries identical to gas(1) output on everything
gcc is likely to throw at it.
Alternatively, we could simply stop using as(1) macros and do it in C
preprocessor, or, (much) better yet, m4.  At least those have documented
semantics that is not likely to change at random...
