In  non-block allocation case, what metadata are we journaling in 
writepage() ?
block allocation happend in prepare_write() and commit_write() journaled the
transaction. All the meta data updates should be done there.  What JBD 
commit
are you refering to here ?

Yes. You are right. I never realized that, we call 
prepare_write()/commit_write() for
each write. I was under the impression that we do it only on the first 
instantiation of
the page. I will take a closer look at it.
The reasons for looking at writepage() are:
- want to support writepages()  for ext3. Last time when I tried, ran into
page->lock and journal_start() deadlock. Thats why I want to understand the
journalling better and clean it up while looking at it.
- eventually, I want to add delayed allocation to make use of multiblock 
allocation.
Right now, we can't make use of multiblock allocation for buffered mode :(
Thanks,
Badari
