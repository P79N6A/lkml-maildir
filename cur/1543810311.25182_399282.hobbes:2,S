Uhm, last time I checked, sys-kernel/vanilla-sources was just that -
vanilla kernel.org sources handled by the package manager.
If you check what is in portage currently, there are no 2.6.15-rc or
even _any_ version that have a -rX, so he either used the
gentoo-sources, or he used 2.6.15.1 which had a bug that was fixed in
2.6.16-rc4 (assuming, as there are no 2.6.16-r4 on kernel.org).  No way
to know if he don't specify the correct version, or try the same version
directly from kernel.org (which would probably give the same results if
he really did use vanilla-sources).

Maybe, but did you file a bug ?  No reason for random ranting if you had
issues with their patched kernel.  I can name many other distribution
kernels, and some kernel.org ones that had issues, but then it usually
was my own fault if it stayed an issue.
