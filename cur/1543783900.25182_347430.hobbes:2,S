I'm unfortunately not able to help you with your specific problem, but
a few words of advice: you really ought to start by reproducing the
problem with a recent kernel - like 2.4.31 or 2.6.13.
2.4.26 is really ancient and noone really cares about it any more.
You should probably also talk to the netdev people (CC'ed).
