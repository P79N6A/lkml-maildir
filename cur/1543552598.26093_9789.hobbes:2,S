On that specific bit I haven't seen it go out of sync yet.  However, I program
it defensively because I already got bit by the fact that the X86_FEATURE_PN
bit on Intel means something different than on AMD and as a result of getting
it wrong my first time out, AMD CPUs were segfaulting when I tried to disable
their non-existent serial number.  So, since these bits vary from vendor to
vendor, I would prefer to see it handled like the PN bit, that is check for
all vendors that *do* use the bit to mean FXSR or XMM, but don't rely on all
vendors to do so.  In that case, we could check for vendor == INTEL || vendor
== AMD, but I would still prefer to see *some* check on the vendor before
honoring the bits.

For Intel and AMD, yes.  I still wouldn't trust it vendor wide though...my
experience in doing that is not positive...

Indeed we can, and it also goes along with what you mentioned above about
being easier to disable the xmm if need be because of testing mmu_cr4_features
instead of x86_capabilities.
I'll have some more stuff out tonight, so if you want to wait for that it will
include the items we've discussed here as well as some other things I've been
working on.
