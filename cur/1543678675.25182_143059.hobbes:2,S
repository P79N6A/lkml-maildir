I copy the number from the 'total' column after free -m. They're
about 256x3 with Crusoe gave about 24M to CMS (I guess).
I tried the tests again with swapoff, on tmpfs, on disks, the result
are approximately the same. The 'kernel' used for compilation and
the setting are exactly the same (2.4.21-ac1). The 'kernel' used to run the
test and the setting are about the same (2.4.21-ac1 vs ac2).
The desktop is Red Hat 8, gcc 3.2. The TPC is Red Hat 9, gcc 3.2.
So the result are real, no disk speed related. What do you think?
I can't look at the running CMS or the translation cache so I don't know 
what
it is doing but I guess that after several run of gcc+as+ld,
the CMS still decide to interpret most part of their x86 code.
Am I wrong?
Or that TM5800 is already running as fast as possible? (from tcache)
