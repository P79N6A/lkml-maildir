I fired it up on one of the older chipsets...

As you suspected, it didn't work.

I also found something interesting, by accident.  With a stock FC4 kernel,
the i2cdump clocked at 1.02s total.  With 2.6.13-rc6, it took 5.11s!  The
only relevant difference that I can see is that the FC4 kernel uses HZ of
1000 while my 2.6.13-rc6 kernel uses 100.  Because the i2c-viapro is a
polling driver, it becomes slower as HZ decreases.
I.e. the improvement you are seeing with byte vs. block xfers is quite
exaggerated because we poll the device relatively infrequently.  *All*
the xfers are slower than they could be w/ a non-polling driver.
