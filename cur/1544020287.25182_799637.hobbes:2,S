I should have said "search for empty lines", but yes, I should have
trimmed a bit.  My apologies!!!

Could well be, ACCESS_ONCE() showed up in 2.6.24, and moved out of
rcupdate.h a couple of releases later.

Touche!  ;-)
But in that case, why do you need the synchronize_rcu() following the
on_each_cpu() above?  Is this needed to make sure that any concurrent
load_debug_registers() call has completed?
