OK, that'll work fine.  Probably next week sometime.

Any system where BSOD is anything other than a screensaver is
lacking many kinds of sensibility ... :)
That question was mostly for curiousity.  The issue with interrupt
endpoints and data toggle is trivially resolved by using ep6in-bulk
instead of ep5in-int.  Which is what the autoconfig version will
likely end up doing, since default quality-of-service model for
interrupt endpoints includes having working data toggle.  PXA is
wierd in that way, but it's got endpoints to burn.

Sure it gets sent, but does it get used?  If it does,
does the data toggle matter, or is MSFT by default
ignoring the toggle (and hence letting that needless
data stream be undetectably corrupted)?

OK, so good basic coverage.  Modulo bugs introduced by
various service packs or national releases ... ;)
