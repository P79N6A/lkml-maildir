according to debian/testing's /usr/share/doc/util-linux/copyright:
-----
This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of util-linux.
This package was put together by Guy Maor <maor@debian.org> and later
maintained by Sean 'Shaleh' Perry <shaleh@debian.org>.
Current maintainer is Adrian Bunk <bunk@fs.tum.de>.

hope that helps,
