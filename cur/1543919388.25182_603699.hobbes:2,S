This should be fixed trivially in the very same way as for x86_64, i.e. 
something like
diff --git a/arch/s390/kernel/binfmt_elf32.c b/arch/s390/kernel/binfmt_elf32.c
index f1e40ca..4b5432d 100644

 }
 
+extern void arch_randomize_brk(void);
 #include "../../../fs/binfmt_elf.c"
right? Maybe this would be needed for other architectures too :( I will 
check this. I'd really like the patch go in, so that we have really full 
randomization finally.

I agree that it is a total mess. We'd need someone brave enough to rewrite 
this crap :/
