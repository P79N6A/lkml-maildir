I asked Kurt why it was not submitted to the mainstream kernel. He said that
some people are still experiencing problems with the card/driver and he doesn't
feel it's stable enough to go in. I'm personally using it with no issues, but
I'm only driving a CD-RW - not exactly stressing things.
It sounds like the people having issues need to debug the problems, or maybe
it could go in under CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL ?
