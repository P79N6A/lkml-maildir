percpu_counter_init uses kmalloc to create percpu counters. This raises an 
early exception as kmem_cache is not initialized that early.
It worked for me if we statically allocate memory for the counters. But its 
not at all a nice thing to do and I don't see another way to make it fit for 
early use.
I'm beginning to run out of ideas! Why not do what I earlier suggested - begin 
collecting statistics once we are able to safely use percpu_counters ? This 
now seems to be the best alternative IMHO.
