	Thanks for looking at my patches.
	I did post the patch unpinning sysfs directories, two and
a half weeks ago (the second URL is for a header file that I left out):
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=110257739705683&w=2
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=110257894222719&w=2
	The patches work fine for me.  I have been running with
all of these patches applied on every kernel that I've run up to
now (2.6.10-bk2) with zero problems.  I am not a heavy sysfs user,
but I have tried running your tests (loading and unloading the
dummy network module while reading the sysfs files that it creates),
including right now on 2.6.10-bk2.
	I am keen to know what you think of the patch unpinning
sysfs directories.
