Subject: [PATCH 05/13] checkpatch: try to catch missing VMLINUX_SYMBOL() in vmlinux.lds.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/7/134

From: Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>
Seems like every other release we have someone who updates vmlinux.lds.h and
adds C-visible symbols without VMLINUX_SYMBOL() around them.  So start
checking the file and reject assignments which have plain symbols on either
side.
[apw@canonical.com: soften the check, add tests]
