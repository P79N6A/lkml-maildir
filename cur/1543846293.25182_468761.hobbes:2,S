no, I was suggesting a pack file that contained _only_ the head version.
within the pack file it would delta against other files in the pack (how many 
copies of the GPLv2 text exist across all files for example)
however Willy did a test and found that the resulting pack was significantly 
larger then a .tgz. I don't know what options he used, so while there's some 
chance that being more agressive in looking for deltas would result in an 
improvement, the difference to make up is fairly significant.
