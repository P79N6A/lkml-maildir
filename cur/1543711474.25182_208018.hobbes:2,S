I think an atomic counter in the workqueue-function would be more efficient.
What do you think about this?
static atomic_t recv_work_count;
static void recv_handler(void *data)
{
	if (atomic_inc_and_test(&recv_work_count)) {
		do {
			/* work to do */
		} while (!atomic_add_negative(-1, &recv_work_count));
	}
}
static int __init kcapi_init(void)
{
	atomic_set(&recv_work_count, -1);
}
A second call to the recv_handler() just results in an additional loop
of the first one and the second CPU goes on with its work.
Unfortunately, the atomic functions are not available on all architechtures.
atomic_dec_and_test() is the only atomic function with return value on all
platforms, right? Which isn't enough for the loop above.
