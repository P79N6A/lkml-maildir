That's a strange statement, maybe we could get some clarification on 
it?  From the dmesg lines you posted before, it appeared that the 
hardware was failing the request with a bad disk sense code.  As I said 
before, normally Linux has no problem reading the good parts of a 
partially bad disk, so I wonder exactly what Mark means by "upper layers 
which are only zero fault tollerant"?
