claims that the Logitech Quickcam Pro 3000 is a "True 640 x 480 
resolution video capture" which is now clearly false.
It would appear I have found an answer to my question.  The reason 
Philips made Nemosoft sign an NDA was not to hide proprietory 
information from their competitors.  It was to hide the fact that they 
were misrepresenting the resolution of their cameras to their 
customers.  No wonder Nemosoft did not feel right about opening this 
module even after the NDA expired, he would be telling the world their 
dirty little secret.  Of course I'm sure this was common knowledge to 
all those people who work in robotics and always demand an uncompressed 
stream from the camera.
