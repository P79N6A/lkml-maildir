I did not change it and I have yet to get a good reason from the person
who did.  I have explained why it was wrong to change, but I guess things
will have to start crashing again when Linus accepts changes that I never
looked at or discussed.
Take it up with ManDrake Linux folks, it was there person that submitted
the change directly.  I have VETOed the change, that only works in an
environment that respects boundaries and specialities.
I do not like the final changes that are in pre9-final.
There appears no valid reason for the change.
The one line delete and replace ment for the extra 20 (twenty) is bloat.
The change dorks up the modes if it PCI or Legacy.
Since ALL modern PCI-IDE chipsets that are onboard do not behave in native
mode because the first 4 PCI BARS are empty (is everyone listening?)
This is not "native mode" but "compatable mode".
Only devices that fill the first for BARS with the legacy IO's can claim
"native"; regardless, I am sorry that your system is crapped out.
Bitch Linus and not me
Cheers,
