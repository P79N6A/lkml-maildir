For us, the conversion only needs to be done during prepare_write (readpage
reads directly from the tail into the page).  We chose to do it in
get_block because it seemed to fit...prepare_write gives us an offset in
the file, and we give prepare_write a block.  Sometimes that means a tail
conversion is involved, sometimes not.  prepare_write just doesn't care.

Yes, that's why I posted the reiserfs specific code for writepage and
truncate.  If we can pull a generic function out of that, and the work done
for other fragment supporting filesystems, perfect.

I'm not trying to put it all into a single get_block call, we have
different get_block funcs for different purposes.  What I'm really trying
to do is squeeze into block_prepare_write, as a generic setup function for
file modifications.
The other reason why I convert in get_block is that is when I've got the
most information about the internals of the file, including a path through
the btree to the item that may or may not need converting.  In reiserfs,
the only way to find out if the last item of the file is packed is to
search the tree for it, and the same searching code is used if it is a
packed or an unpacked item.
In other words, even if reiserfs_prepare_write didn't use
block_prepare_write, I would probably still convert in a function similar
to reiserfs_get_block.
