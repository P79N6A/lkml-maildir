Oh shit! This is the "Al Viro stink test" Linus spoke of.
Now, if no LVM type ifrastructure is included in 2.6, all (all who use an
LVM of some type) will all have to
1. update to the latest mainline
2. download the latest dm or evms patch
3. fix all the patch rejects themselves (big problem to overcome when
trying to get people to test with the latest kernel)
I'm NOT saying this is some kind of argument toward inclusion. I guess
I'm just lamenting. I really hoped I'd have one less 3rd party patch to
maintain in my own personal tree.
