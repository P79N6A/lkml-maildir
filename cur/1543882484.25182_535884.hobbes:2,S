Subject: [ext3][kernels >= 2.6.20.7 at least] KDE going comatose when FS is under heavy write load (massive starvation)

Greetings,
As subject states, my GUI is going away for extended periods of time
when my very full and likely highly fragmented (how to find out)
filesystem is under heavy write load.  While write is under way, if
amarok (mp3 player) is running, no song change will occur until write is
finished, and the GUI can go _entirely_ comatose for very long periods.
Usually, it will come back to life after write is finished, but
occasionally, a complete GUI restart is necessary.
The longest comatose period to date was ~20 minutes with 2.6.20.7 a few
days ago.  I was letting SuSE's software update programs update my SuSE
10.2 system, and started a bonnie while it was running (because I had
been seeing this on recent kernels, and wanted to see if it was in
stable as well), WHAM, instant dead GUI.  When this happens, kbd and
mouse events work fine, so I hot-keyed to a VT via CTRL+ALT+F1, and
killed the bonnie.  No joy, GUI stayed utterly comatose until the
updater finished roughly 20 minutes later, at which time the shells I'd
tried to start popped up, and all worked as if nothing bad had ever
happened.  During the time in between, no window could be brought into
focus, nada.
While a bonnie is writing, if I poke KDE's menu button, that will
instantly trigger nastiness, and a trace (this one was with a cfs
kernel, but I just did same with virgin 2.6.21) shows that "kicker",
KDE's launcher proggy does an fdatasync for some reason, and that's the
end of it's world for ages.  When clicking on amarok's icon, it does an
fsync, and that's the last thing that will happen in it's world until
write is done as well.  I've repeated this with CFQ and AS IO
schedulers.
I have a couple of old kernels lying around that I can test with, but I
think it's going to be the same.  Seems to be ext3's journal that is
causing my woes.  Below this trace of kicker is one of amarok during
it's dead to the world time.
Box is 3GHz P4 intel ICH5, SMP/UP doesn't matter.  .config is latest
kernel tested attached.  Mount options are
noatime,nodiratime,acl,user_xattr.
