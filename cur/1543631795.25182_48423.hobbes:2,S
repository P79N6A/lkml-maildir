Oh I know they are.  I was doing all of this stuff while in grad
school back in 1996, and later at my first job I was doing this
stuff too.  Had to use LynxOS back then.  Would have been nice if
we could have used Linux...  I was watching RTLinux closely back
then -- long before the patent problem.  :)

That was the hope.  So people would understand that this isn't
the type of application where you can just squirrel away the
real-time bits in a device driver...  Its got to be the whole
thing,
