Tested and Alexey's patch (copied below) fixes the problem. I added a
signed-off-by just in case; feel free to yank it if inappropriate.
Regardless, please apply.
Thanks Len, Alexey.

Subject: ACPI: resolve GPE immediate wakeup regression
From: Alexey Starikovskiy <alexey.y.starikovskiy@linux.intel.com>
Removing disabling of GPEs from enter_sleep function causes regression
on nx6125.
Doing disable_all_gpes both in prepare to sleep and in enter sleep
resolves regression,
while still fixes Acer notebooks.
