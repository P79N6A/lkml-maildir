Thanks, I've downloaded them and will take a look at them. By the time, I did
some random tests with 'ip arp', and found a simple way to solve the problem
I reported initially. This can be of interest to others BTW :
Trivial example below :
   My host wants to use address 10.0.0.1 to talk to the world, but through
   the gateway 11.0.0.2 reachable from 11.0.0.1 :
   ip address add 10.0.0.1/24 dev eth0
   ip address add 11.0.0.1/24 dev eth0
   ip route   add default     via 11.0.0.2 src 10.0.0.1
=> same as before till this
   ip arp     append table output to 11.0.0.0/24 oif eth0 src 11.0.0.1
=> now it will use 11.0.0.1 to find its gateway (11.0.0.2)
So as a general rule of thumb, I would recommend people to systematically call
"ip arp append table output to [network] oif [NIC] src [local_ip]" after an
"ip address add [local_ip] dev [NIC]". And yes, I agree that these are standard
tools, but I maintain that the default behaviour should be cleaner.
I also found that I can filter incoming requests easily with "table input" :
   ip arp append table input deny
   ip arp add    table input allow from 11.0.0.0/24 to 11.0.0.0/24 iif eth0
   ip arp add    table input allow from 10.0.0.0/24 to 10.0.0.0/24 iif eth0
I don't understand how the forward table is used, BTW, but I'll search a bit
more. If I finally understand how all this works, I may propose a simple how-to
to put under Documentation/networking/arp.txt so solve most common problems.
Cheers,
Willy
