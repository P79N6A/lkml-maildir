OK, if we don't yet know, I'd rather leave this for later.  It will be
trivial to change to user_struct if we want per-user rlimits.

See reply to relevant patch.

Definitely not euid.  Euid is the one which is effective, i.e. it will
basically always be zero for a privileged mount().
Ruid is the one which is returned by getuid().  If a user execs a
suid-root program, then ruid will be the id of the user, while euid
will be zero.

The argument applies to umount as well.  For compatibility, we _need_
the CAP_SYS_ADMIN check.  And if program has CAP_SETUID but not
CAP_SYS_ADMIN, it can just set the id to the mount owner before
calling umount.
