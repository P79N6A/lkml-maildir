The really important bit there is that you see dropped frames in overlay
mode. Overlay mode the hardware is copying directly. The only way you should
lose frames in overlay mode is if the chip couldnt sync to that frame or
the PCI bus was fully loaded by other traffic and the transfer failed. There
are some other corner cases too (certainly video cards can run out of
bandwidth during accelerated operations like bitblt)
