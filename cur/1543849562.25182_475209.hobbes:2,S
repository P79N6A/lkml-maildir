As a minimal solution your patch would work for MIPS but performance would be
suboptimal.
With my D-cache alias series applied the flush_cache_mm() in dup_mmap()
becomes entirely redundant.  When I delete the call (not part of my patchset)
it means 12% faster fork.  But I'm not proposing this for 2.6.19.
Note this does not make the flush_cache_mm() on process termination
redundant ...
