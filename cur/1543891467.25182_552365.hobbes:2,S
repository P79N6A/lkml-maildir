I'm on Christoph's side here.  I don't think it makes sense for any code
to ask to allocate zero bytes of memory and expect valid memory to be
returned.
Would a compromise be to return a pointer to some known invalid region?
This way the kmalloc(0) call would appear successful to the caller, but
any access to the memory would result in an exception.
Just my 2 cents,
