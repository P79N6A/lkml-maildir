You don't understand.  You don't *want* to set aside a block of memory 
that's
reserved for DMA.  You want to be able to DMA directly into any user 
address.
Consider demand paging.  The performance would suck if you DMA into some
fixed region then copied to the user address.  Plus you then have another
resource you have to manage in the kernel.  And you still have to change all
the drivers, buffer management, etc. to add a flag that says "I'm going 
to use
this for DMA" to allocations.  You might as well add the quiesce 
function, it's
probably easier to do.  And it doesn't help if you DMA to static memory
addresses.
I, too, would like a simpler solution.  I just don't think this is it.
