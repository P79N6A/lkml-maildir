Last time I booted my NexGen 586 it was linux 1.<something late>.  But back
then I was able to work just fine in 486 mode.  You definately have to
keep the FP emulation enabled unless you bought a NexGen 587.  Make sure
you have all the BIOS updates installed... some of them include some
patches to the NexGen 586 microcode and/or configuration settings that
would effect you.
