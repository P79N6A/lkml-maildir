I'm getting a lot of this with 2.4.10 also.  At the time, I had KDM
running, but I was coming into the box over telnet and running the
latest released version of LTP.  The test it appeared to be on at the
time was a filesystem test called growfiles.  Nothing else was running
other than these things and standard system services.  The machine has
256 MB of ram, and 512 MB swap.  The order that things got killed in
were sadc, sar, kdm, X, in.telnetd, xinetd (ouch).
