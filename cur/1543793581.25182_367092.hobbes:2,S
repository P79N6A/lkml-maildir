I have a pretty simple plan for this:
- Add a timer to struct request. It already has a timeout field for
  SG_IO originated requests, we could easily utilize this in general.
  I'm not sure how the querying of timeout would happen so far, it would
  probably require a q->set_rq_timeout() hook to ask the low level
  driver to set/return rq->timeout for a given request.
- Add a timeout hook to struct request_queue that would get invoked from
  the timeout handler. Something along the lines of:
        - Timeout on a request happens. Freeze the queue and use
          kblockd to take the actual timeout into process context, where
          we call the queue ->rq_timeout() hook. Unfreeze/reschedule
          queue operations based on what the ->rq_timeout() hook tells
          us.
That is generic enough to be able to arm the timeout automatically from
->elevator_activate_req_fn() and dearm it when it completes or gets
deactivated. It should also be possible to implement the SCSI error
handling on top of that.
