In case anyone decides to take a look, there's a line missing which was 
supposed to advance the timeout in the case where we haven't yet timed out, 
and the task is not interactive.  A better way to do what I intended is to 
change...
      if (rq->idx && TASK_INTERACTIVE(p))
           rq->interval_ts++
to
      if (!rq->idx - !TASK_INTERACTIVE(P) == 0)
            rq->interval_ts++;
With this diff in place, and with bonnie and a make bzImage sharing my cpu 
with irman2, I see no terminal starvation.  Both the make and bonnie are 
proceeding just fine.
         ciao,
         -Mike
