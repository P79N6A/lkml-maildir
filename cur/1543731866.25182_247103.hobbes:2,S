Hi,
I just tried to give it a go with libata from 2.6.9-rc1. I had to fix
one rejects but the patching seemed to go fine beside that. Nevertheless
after a boot with patched libata I get:
smartctl -a /dev/sda
smartctl version 5.30 Copyright (C) 2002-4 Bruce Allen

Device: ATA      SAMSUNG SP1614N  Version: TM10
Serial number: 0735J1FW702444
Device type: disk
Local Time is: Mon Aug 30 19:44:23 2004 CEST
Device does not support SMART
Device does not support Error Counter logging
[GLTSD (Global Logging Target Save Disable) set. Enable Save with '-S on']
Device does not support Self Test logging
I am pretty sure my drive supports SMART. I hope that I understood your
post correctly that with this patch it should work.
Cheers,
Prakash
