For those of us that just want something working now:
Patch up using the latest sk98lin patch generator.. then edit
drivers/net/sk98lin/sky2.c and add this line:
#include "h/skdrv1st.h"
#include "h/skdrv2nd.h"
#include <linux/tcp.h>
#include <linux/ip.h>               <-- ADD THIS
It will build fine and seems to work just fine until syskonnect
releases a new revision
