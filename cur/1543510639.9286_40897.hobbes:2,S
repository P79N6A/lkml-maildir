First off let's remember how CPU's are manufactured. Typically there's
no difference between, say, a 433Mhz chip and a 333Mhz chip - the
likelyhood is that they came off the same production line and the only
difference is that the faster chip passed a (quite short) set of tests
at that speed.
The same applies to all the components in the system - all are
designed to work with an "acceptable" error rate at a given speed but
some will work at higher speeed, however, unlike CPUs there's not
usually a higher value attached to faster parts.
I don't really see that there's any fundamental difference between
overclocking a bus and overclocking a CPU - both are making an
assumption and a trade-off between the acceptable safety margin and
performance. For my home machine this trade off definately favours
performance.
