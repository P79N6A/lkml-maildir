Yup - exactly.
The up to date allowed memory container for a task is in its cpuset,
which does have the locking mechanisms needed for safe access from
other tasks.
The task mems_allowed is just a private cache of the mems_allowed of
its cpuset, used for quick access from within the task context by the
page allocation code.
