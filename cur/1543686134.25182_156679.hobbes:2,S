By your arguments, virt_to_page() is also misnamed.  It is not possible
to take the page pointer result and use that to get back to the virtual
address input to virt_to_page().
I think as a first step, it's more important to have consistent names
for the two translation routines used.
As a secondary step, we can fix virt_to_*() naming, as appropriate.
Ok?
