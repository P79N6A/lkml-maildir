It depends on the person but yes I had considered that.

Maybe they want stability and certainty first.

That seems fine to me. I would have thought putting the code you have
into the quirks.c file as you proposed was the better way to do this,
but with the addition of the 
#if defined (CONFIG_ATA_AHCI) || defined(CONFIG_ATA_AHCI_MODULE)
#endif
around it, was sufficient ?
