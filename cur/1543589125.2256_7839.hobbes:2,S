It works. Most of the early testing and development was done on it. It 
wouldn't give you dynamic sizing like ramfs though. 
It would be nice to have a version of ramfs which compresses pages into a 
separate backing store when they're unused. Shame somebody nicked the name 
'cramfs' for something else, really :)
But I'm confused. Padraig, if you have no backing store, where do the 
initial contents of your root filesystem come from?
