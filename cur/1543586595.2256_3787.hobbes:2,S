rev < 128 => G400, rev >= 128 => G450. Ask Matrox why they did so stupid

Secondary output on G400 is in monitor mode by default. Are you sure
that you
insmodded all needed modules to kernel? i2c-matrox, matroxfb_maven,
matroxfb_crtc2, ...
If you do not know which ones, just build everything into kernel - and
do not forget
about i2c bit-banging as documented in documentation...
