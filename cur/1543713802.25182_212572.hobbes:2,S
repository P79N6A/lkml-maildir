Andrew, am I right that this is NOT needed for the proposed O_DIRECT
option, since open(2) says: 
  "The I/O is synchronous, i.e., at the completion of the read(2) or
   write(2) system call, data is guaranteed to have been transferred."
so the write will block until data is physically on the disk.
Cheers,
