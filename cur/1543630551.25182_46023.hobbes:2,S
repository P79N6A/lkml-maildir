Not going thru the socket layer will slow you down even more.  It will require
you to re-write every single performance-requiring application every time some
bloke designs a new network interconnect with a new API.
I'd take a 5% performance loss over re-writing all my code any day.
But why would it be any slower going over the socket API ?  After all, quite a
lot of people have put quite a lot of effort into making that API perform very
well.

But not until you port DOOM to the API-of-the-day.   Sweet idea though  ;)

Latency kills.
Adding tracks to the highway doesn't make it any shorter.
