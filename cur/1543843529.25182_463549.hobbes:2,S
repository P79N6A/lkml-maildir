i disagree with the naming, for the reasons stated before: if we add any 
static info to the kernel, it's a "easier data extraction" thing (for 
the purposes of speeding up dynamic tracing), not a tracepoint. That way 
there's no dispute whether what i remove is a tracepoint (on which 
static tracers might rely in a hard way), or just a speedup for 
SystemTap. So a better name would be what SystemTap has implemented 
today:
  STAP_MARK_NN(kernel_context_switch, prev, next);
or what makes this even more explicit:
  DEBUG_DATA(kernel_context_switch, prev, next);
(but i'm flexible about the naming - as long as it doesnt say 'trace' 
and as long as there are no guarantees at all that those points remain, 
when a better method of accessing the same data for dynamic tracers is 
implemented.)
