Its not that it is hard to do, you might even get the current patch to
apply, more or less. 
The real problem is that it would not do you much good.  The 2.4.x work
removed a LOT of long held spinlocks and BKLs that the patch can not
(and does not in 2.4.x) fix.  Thus you would still have long latency
issues, even with the patch.
