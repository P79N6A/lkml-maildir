Why is RLIMIT_MEMLOCK special enough to warrant special treatment like
this? The right capability should be able to override with setrlimit(2)
anyways, right?

Quoting the manpage: "In Linux kernels before 2.6.9, this limit
controlled the amount of memory that could be locked by a privileged
process."
This is nonsense, and it appears as though 2.6.8 and earlier didn't
apply the limit to unprivileged processes. Should the behavior stay as
inconsistent as it's now, I'd suggest to reword this to "...before
2.6.9, this limit controlled the amount of memory that could be locked
by /any/ process." or something even better if someone can think of
such. (manpages maintainer Cc'd)

This doesn't appear to happen for SUSE 10.0, which causes trouble with
some of the "multimedia apps" BTW... apparently the limit was lowered at
the same time as the root restrictions were relaxed.
Such changes in behavior aren't adequate for 2.6.X, there are way too
many applications that can't be bothered to check the patchlevel of the
kernel, and it's totally unintuitive to users, too. Aside from the fact
that most distros have settled on one kernel.

No, I'm not doing that. I rather wonder why it's so low, or whom a certain
percentage such as RAM >> 5 (that's 3.125 %) would hurt. Allowing
unlimited memory allocation while at the same time allowing only 32 kB
of mlock()ed memory seems disproportionate to me.
