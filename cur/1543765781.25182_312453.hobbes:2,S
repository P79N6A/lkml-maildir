Because prune_icache() _also_ removes the inode from the hash before
dropping the inode lock. It shouldn't -- the inode should only get
removed from the hash when it's actually been cleared. That's the real
bug -- and I agree that the fix isn't to expose internal locks to let
JFFS2 work around it.
prune_icache() (and probably invalidate_inodes() too) needs to leave the
inode on the hash list while it's being freed.
