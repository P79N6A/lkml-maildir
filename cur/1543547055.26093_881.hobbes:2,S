I think that can also happen in 2.2.x and plain 2.4-test7.
I have a question. There is a rq queue for eache device, right ? Well, why
when I flood the queue of the removable also write accesses to my harddisc
get starved ?  A simple "cp 100KBfile foobar" from HD to HD can stay
blocked in D state for 10's seconds even with a lot of free mem.
Perhaps because the queue spinlock is global ?  m, no I can't see a code
path that holds the lock for a lot of time...
The HD and the removable are attached to two different SCSI controllers (2
Adaptec 2930U).
Bye.
