it was easier to ask san - it takes a lot of time to FIND the relevant
50 lines.. liek xfre86 - its not a matter of the code being hard - its
just so vast that you cant find the bit of code - so i ask those who've
been there before to save time hunting it :)

aaaaaaaah :) much better :) (i've spent enuf time today finding the
video reset code in the kernel on boot... still nto sure exactly where
it gets done... might be hidden in some of that x86 ASM... and x86 ASM
is almost unradable... oh do i year for 68k... mmmm... readable asm...
