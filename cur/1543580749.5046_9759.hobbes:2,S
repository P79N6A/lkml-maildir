I'd never dipute that.  It was just an answers to Stephen's "a kiobuf is
already smaller".

The semantics aren't different for the using subsystem.  LOANED vs GIFTED
is an issue for the free function, COW will probably be a page-level mm
thing - though I haven't thought a lot about it yet an am not sure wether
it actually makes sense.

It could also be a [0] array at the end, allowing for a single allocation,
but that looks more like a implementation detail then a design problem to me.

Hmm.  Currently it is used only for the multiple buffer_head's per iobuf
cruft, and I don't see why multiple outstanding IOs should be noted in a
kiobuf.

Yes, there needs to be an kio_errno field - though I wanted to get rid of
it I had to readd in in later versions of my design.

Of course it doesn't work. We've performed a software upgrade.
