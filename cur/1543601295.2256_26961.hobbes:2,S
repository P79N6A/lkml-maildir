Hello.
I experienced problems with their 40 GB and 75 GB variants. The first one was 
made in Thaiwan. So it isn't really a matter from where they're coming from.
I'm testing right now. I have applied a special crc-patch and a self-made patch. 
The problems didn't appeared again yet. I'm also testing with UDMA modes. The 
drives are coming with UDMA 5 enabled, but linux and my board are'nt supporting 
it. So I downspeeded them with IBM's Feature Tool. I first experienced faults 
with linux>=2.4.5-ac12. Mostly the errors appeared after a boot in the morning 
as the drive was down for hours and cold too.
But I don't own any RAID-controllers. I have just a simple UDMA2-controller. 
Maybe these faults are only occuring in connection with my specific hardware. I 
don't know.
So if you hadn't had any problems before you're disks would be safe for now.
