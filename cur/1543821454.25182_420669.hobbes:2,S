I'm pretty sure that sparse can't validate all the casting from void 
pointers and from "base classes". Nor can it find bugs in data 
structures which are open-coded instead of template libraries. Do 
correct me if I'm wrong.
I'm not familiar with sparse's capabilities beyond __user, locking 
depth, and the like (pulling it now). Can you point me to any information?
