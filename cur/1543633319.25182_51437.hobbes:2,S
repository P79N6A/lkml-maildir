hi all,
i'd like to create a new ioctl for use in my kernels [actually i already 
have 8-)] but want to make sure that i follow any established procedure 
for creating it before requesting it be included in the kernel. 
 specifically, is there a way to ensure the ioctl number i use isn't in 
use by anyone else?  is there a central registry?
so far i've just picked an arbitrary number:
