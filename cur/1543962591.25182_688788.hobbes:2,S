Right. This Makefile is a nasty trap. I looked into it and the fix for
now is below. Long term this Makefile trickery needs to be cleaned up
to avoid trapping into this again.

Subject: x86: undo visws/numaq build changes

arch/x86/pci/Makefile_32 has a nasty detail. VISWS and NUMAQ builds
override the generic pci-y rules. This needs a proper cleanup, but
that needs more thoughts. Undo
commit 895d30935ebe05f192e844792668bf8d19deaae7
    x86: numaq fix
    do not override the existing pci-y rule when adding visws or
    numaq rules.
and add a comment to the Makefile.
Remove the srat stub code in discontig_32.c to allow a proper NUMAQ
build.
