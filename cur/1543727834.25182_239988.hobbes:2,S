Key might not be there though, leading to many repeated requests. Three
points:
1) A netlink binary "server" looks a hell of a lot like a nameserver, and
those are a roaring success in terms of stability and performance. When
considering nameservers other than bind, I'd also add security and leanness
to that list.
2) One can also send text over datagrams (think SIP)
3) Debugging netlink communications is actually not that hard as other
processes can listen in on netlink communications given certain settings,
think 'netlinkdump'. Especially easy when doing ASCII over netlink!
