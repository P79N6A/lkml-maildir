Yes.  How does this stop the users from enjoying any of the freedoms?

Mixing two different issues here.
The checksums embedded in the ISO images are implemented in anaconda
itself, provided along with the distro, so anyone can generate them,
even though I don't know the precise algorithm.  The checksums over
the ISO images themselves are implemented with sha1sum (earlier,
md5sum), so anyone can generate them too.
As for the GPG signatures in the RPMs and in the SHA1SUM file, these
are indeed generated using public algorithms but private keys.  But
these signatures are not functional, and they don't in any way stop
anyone from enjoying freedoms.

It looks like you read only Linus' messages, not my responses.  A
write-only CD is like ROM.  It's not the distributor who's imposing
restrictions on its modification.  Nobody can modify it because nature
says so.  It's not like the software is being recorded in a CD as a
means to prevent you from modifying it.
