well, you are assuming those latencies are visible with eyes. they might
be in extreme cases, but normally they're not (what people notices
normally are disk latencies, and few people uses an RT userspace
anyways which means they cannot claim the problem to be a lack of
cond_resched, but more likely they want shorter timeslices in the
scheduler etc..). So my point is that you need a measurement tool anyways...
