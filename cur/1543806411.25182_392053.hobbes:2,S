Ok, looks bad. It's through
    __dequeue_signal():
	collect_signal():
	    __sigqueue_free():
		free_uid()
where we hold the sigqueue lock. We do _not_ want to do BH processing 
there with the lock held and interrupts disabled, so the warning is 
correct, and that uidhash_lock patch potentially causes more problems than 
it fixes.
Perhaps the easiest solution is to just make them irq-safe instead 
of bh-safe? An alternative might be to make __sigqueue_free() do its work 
through RCU callbacks too, but that seems wrong.
Comments? Ingo?
