And I suppose you have a list of these older CPUs or is this going to be
one of these things where in 5 years time I say to yet another person "ah
yes, I remember someone once telling me that old CPUs apparently had some
issues, some blatantly obvious, some more subtle" and the saga continues
on from there again?

With CONFIG_X86_PAT, you now see "CPU and/or kernel does not support PAT."
at the top of your dmesg which is going to make people wonder. I did a
cat /proc/cpuinfo, saw no PAT flag and was just suspicious enough that I
didn't trust it.
A blacklist would be a better idea I feel, but in ANY case I think it's
really bad form to clear the feature flag. They are provided by hardware;
if arch/x86/mm/pat.c won't risk running except on a select few tested
models, whatever, but my /proc/cpuinfo shouldn't be lying to me.
