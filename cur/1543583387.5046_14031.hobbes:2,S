That's a known problem:
The paging io for a process is controlled with a per-process semaphore.
The semaphore is held while waiting for the actual io. Thus the paging
in multi threaded applications is single threaded.
Probably your prefetch thread is waiting for disk io, and the worker
thread causes a minor pagefault --> worker thread sleeps until the disk
io is completed.
