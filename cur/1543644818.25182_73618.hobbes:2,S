   It sounds more like it would include the FIB too.
That's the second level cache, not the top level lookup which
is what hits %99 of the time.
   
   The current FIBs have a bit heavier locking at least. Fine grain locking
   btrees is also not easy/nice.
   
Also not necessary, only the top level cache really needs to be
top performance.
