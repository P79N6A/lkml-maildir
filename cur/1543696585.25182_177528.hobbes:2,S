The qlogic HBAs are supported as well and we do use several qla2340
adapters for connecting to our emc SAN.
The driver is not yet included in 2.4.22 at least, but you can find it on
the qlogic site at 
http://www.qlogic.com/support/product_resources.asp?id=253
We are currently at 6.04-fo (fail over code works very well).
