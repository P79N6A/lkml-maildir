Well it's a technical issue -- it conflicts with the machine check
code that is already implemented by stealing away its events.
You would first need a CONFIG_MCE=n on x86-64 at least, otherwise
one of them will be unhappy.
The other issue is that the existing code does everything EDAC
K8 does already perfectly fine, just in a small fraction of 
the code.
