It's ok for me to trim the Cc: list if noboy objects.
Don't hesistate to ask for clarification if my english comes from Mars.

If size/limit of an underlying object is in a structure for other purpose
than debygging, it means something (S) is working with an object and it (S)
doesn't know what it is. Design proble: always work with an object whose 
identity you know or simply pass a reference to someone knowing better.
I don't see why a 'size' parameter is required. Thus I'm fine with the
following (we are lucky enough that there is enough space in union ifr_ifru 
to hold ifru_settings):
struct ifreq
{
#define IFHWADDRLEN 6
#define IFNAMSIZ    16
    union
    {
        char    ifrn_name[IFNAMSIZ];        /* if name, e.g. "en0" */
    } ifr_ifrn;
    union {
        struct  sockaddr ifru_addr;
        struct  sockaddr ifru_dstaddr;
        struct  sockaddr ifru_broadaddr;
        struct  sockaddr ifru_netmask;
        struct  sockaddr ifru_hwaddr;
        short   ifru_flags;
        int ifru_ivalue;
        int ifru_mtu;
        struct  ifmap ifru_map;
        char    ifru_slave[IFNAMSIZ];   /* Just fits the size */
        char    ifru_newname[IFNAMSIZ];
        char *  ifru_data;
        struct {
             int type;
             union {
                 raw_hdlc_proto *;
                 ...
                 sync_serial_settings *;
                 etc_line_settings *;
			}
		} ifru_settings;
    } ifr_ifru;
};
Note however that struct ifreq on amphetamin (wrt lines of code) doesn't 
improve readability for everybody. That's a slightly different problem.

Agree on this.

I am not too fond of this and, again, what are these 'size' for ?
If it's supposed to replace/duplicate ifreq, the 'settings' part should
be a pointer imho. Same reason as before: size change => compatibility 
problems for tools (we have sources but downgrading tools when returning to
previous kernel sucks).
