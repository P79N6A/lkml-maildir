right, i agree completely.  if it were absolutely reliable in
generating *only* actual unused symbols, then that *might* (i stress,
*might*) be a viable argument for making it part of the Kbuild system.

a few minutes, there's really no motivation to then spend hours trying
to nail those last few harmless bits of irrelevant output.
