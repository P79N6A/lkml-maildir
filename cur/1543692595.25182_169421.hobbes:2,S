This is because it is the same as on the latest 2.4 kernel. 2.6 used
software autorepeat up to test6. Now, because of hardware bugs, it was
necessary to switch back to hardware autorepeat, like 2.4 uses.

Interesting. This probably has much to do with mouse acceleration
settings. What was done was that the mouse report rate was made LOWER
(60 compared to 200) to cure problems with some systems that couldn't
handle the high report rate.
This makes the movement per report larger and thus the acceleration
formula in XFree then works more aggressively.

That one is for ALSA people.
