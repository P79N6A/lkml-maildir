eax is equal to (esp+0x10), which should be dentry_hashtable + offset, a value
which you can find in your System.map.
Did you keep your vmlinux file? If you did, can you show us the 10
instructions preceding the fault? If you've deleted your vmlinux file,
you can extract a symbol-free version from your vmlinuz file and try to
find the pattern below.  Should be quite unique.
