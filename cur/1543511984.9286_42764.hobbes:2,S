Vendor: DPT Model: PM2654U2         Rev: 211D, scsi 3:
DPT I2O Driver Version: 1.06/1.1:
         cmd_per_lun = 210, max_id = 15, max_lun = 7, max_channel = 0
         sg_tablesize = 39, irq = 18, OutstandingMsgs = 10
         maxfromiopmsgs = 64, maxtoiopmsgs = 210
     Devices:
         Channel = 0, Target = 0, Lun = 0
         Channel = 0, Target = 6, Lun = 0
Can anyone tell me if it seems to be more hardware of software (kernel ? 
driver ? related).
Regards, Didier.
