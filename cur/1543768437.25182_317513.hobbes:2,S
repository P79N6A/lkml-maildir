Still easy.
To keep persistent named namespaces in /var/namespaces, thus:
     # Just once please!
     mount -t tmpfs none /var/namespaces
     # Make a named namespace.
     NSNAME='fred'
     mkdir /var/namespaces/$NSNAME
     run_in_new_namespace mount -t bind / /var/namespaces/$NSNAME
     # Make a named namespace for the _original_ namespace.
     mkdir /var/namespaces/initial
     mount -t bind / /var/namespaces/initial
     # Access the namespace.
     ls /var/namespaces/fred
     # Enter the namespace.
     chroot /var/namespaces/fred
     # Delete a named namespace.
     NSNAME='fred'
     umount /var/namespaces/$NSNAME
     rmdir /var/namespaces/$NSNAME
Some of the above will fail due to security checks in fs/namespace.c,
where it tests against current->namespace.  Without those checks,
which seem to have no purpose _other_ than preventing the above usage,
I think the above would all work.
