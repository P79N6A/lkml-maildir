Our software doesn't need any patches like Win4Lin. Our software works
off the standard Linux kernel sources (if they were intact).
THe problem here is that SuSE has gone and changed all the kernel headers
so that now software doesn't compile. It does work if you were using
the stock kerne.org sources.
