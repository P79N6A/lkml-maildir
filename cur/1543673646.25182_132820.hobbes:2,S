The first reaction is that this is a hardware thing.
EXCEPT.
I'm seeing it too, only with recent kernels.
May 14 07:43:43 agamemnon kernel: hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x64
May 14 07:43:43 agamemnon kernel: hda: lost interrupt
May 14 07:43:43 agamemnon kernel: hda: dma_intr: bad DMA status (dma_stat=70)
May 14 07:43:43 agamemnon kernel: hda: dma_intr: status=0x50 { DriveReady SeekComplete }
Happens only with heavy disk IO, running 2.5.69-mm3, happened with a few
earlier kernels and sadly I don't remember which kernel it started on.

<Electro> LordHavoc: i got black lines on stuff in realtime mode, i'll
          take a pic, and it runs slow
<LordHavoc> this is why I LOVE ATI drivers, they're so creative with the
            geometry I give them...
<LordHavoc> they turn a refined and very specific standard for the pixel
            by pixel handling of polygons into an interpretive artform
