No question, no error is detected incorrectly.
But sigwait is not a function specified with an EINTR error number. 
As I said before, this does not mean that EINTR cannot be returned. 
But it will create havoc among programs and it causes undefined
behavior wrt to SA_RESTART.  I think it is best to not have any
function for which EINTR is not a defined error to fail this way. 
This causes the least amount of surprises and unnecessary loops around
the userlevel call sites.
