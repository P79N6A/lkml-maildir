It does a reset and as part of that it registers an empty task which may not
be completed before the module disappears.  Also noticed an extra del_timer
and that it should return ENODEV (not EIO) when a controller is not present.
Sensible fix would be to not queue these empty tasks at all, but minimal fix
(2.4.x) is to just make sure they are off the queue before module vanishes.
Please test as the code in floppy.c is showing 10+yrs of moss growth and 
is not 100% clear to follow :)
Paul.
