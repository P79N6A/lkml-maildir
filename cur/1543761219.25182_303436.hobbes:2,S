Does the BIOS actually support partitions in general?  I thought that
was a problem for the code in the MBR.  As long as your bootcode in the
MBR supports whatever partition scheme you come up with, I can't see how
it should be a problem, but maybe I am missing something.  So what does
GRUB/LILO support?
