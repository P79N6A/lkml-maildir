These are the messages I get when pressing P1 and P2 in my laptop.
kernel: atkbd.c: Unknown key pressed (translated set 2, code 0x153, data 0x74, on isa0060/serio0).
kernel: atkbd.c: Unknown key released (translated set 2, code 0x153, data 0xf4, on isa0060/serio0).
Email and browser keys report a correct code and I can bind thm to any app 
using xbindkeys, but with thes two there's no way.
I'm running 2.6.0-test6--mm1 with the events patch removed.
