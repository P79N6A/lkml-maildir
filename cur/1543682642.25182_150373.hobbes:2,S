Not really. You can still read the received packets from the card (as
you're not issuing any command and are using the other BAP) while a
command is in progress. There are some specific cases in which you need
to have protection, and that cases are avoided with the down_trylock.
AFAIK, interrupt serialization is assured by the interrupt handler, so you
don't need to do that.

This is where I have the biggest problems. As I've read in
Documentation/networking/driver.txt, looks like the packet needs to be
freed "soon", but doesn't require to be before returning 0 in
hard_start_xmit. Did I get it wrong?
Thanks for your help,
