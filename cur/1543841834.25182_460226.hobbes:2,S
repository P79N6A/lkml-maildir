If the swap code was swapped, who would swap it in again?

In general, everything you type in as C code (.bss, .data, .text) should be 
unswappable. kmalloc()ed areas are resident too, and kmalloc has a 
parameter which defines whether the allocation can/cannot push userspace 
pages into the swap (GFP_ATOMIC/GFP_IO). So if there is some 
kernel-allocation swapped out, it is most likely to be marked as 
'userspace' so that the same algorithms can be used for swapin and -out.
