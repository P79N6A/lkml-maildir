I think it's useful.  More generally, I'd like to have
"process context timers" - the ability to call a function
from process context at a set time.  Then a single kernel
thread could handle all things like this.  Pretty simple to do.
BTW: can the OOM killer possibly kill a kernel thread?
If it does, yenta_socket_thread() will nuke the machine.
