TTL logics based on bipolar diffusion transistors?
Certainly *not*. We are in CMOS land here where
the term open collector even doesn't apply at all.
Only the DASP (master slave selection pin) is OC and thus
most propably implemented by a bipolar transitor, which seems
logical, since this line has to have a big fan-out current to
basically enable quite a few gates.

This is most possibly the hard wired resistor bridge used for termination
which you see "sucking the power".

Not at all. (BTW. I don't do my main developement on a notebook. Never
said that.)

Did I say it was cheap CMOS and not TTL? Do you still wonder
why the output drivers are not able to provide strong output currents?

It is most likely that the special "host" provides only special
partial termination. And the ribbons you use are most propably of
low resistance (possibly silver plated copper cores).
Otherwise the signals from the disks wouldn't be able to travel back.
