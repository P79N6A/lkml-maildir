These are usually error conditions. If you inline them, you will have
to jump *over* them as part of the normal code path. You don't save
any instructions, and you end up with a kernel which has much more
duplicated code and thus thrashes the cache more. It also makes the
code harder to read. goto makes it easy "stack" error handlers and not
worry about the order in which you do clean up.
