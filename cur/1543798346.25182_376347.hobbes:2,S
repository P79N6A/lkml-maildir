Hmm - having written both /proc and /sys parsers i'm not sure your new
setup will be any easier to handle in a program than /proc/cpuinfo. Probably not.
I would suggest you supply a standard C library and command line utility
at least - but at least for the later the output would
be likely not that different from cat /proc/cpuinfo

That makes sense. /proc/cpuinfo is not that bad in itself, except that
it's very architecture dependent.
