No, I'm not kidding. The most annoyed ones are those who don't have serial
ports and who need those annoying USB adapters. But fortunately, not all
of them need to access router consoles :-)

Probably that you got the wrong laptop. If you buy an ultra-thin with highly
proprietary hardware, it may be hard. But if you choose in profesionnal ranges,
there is rarely any problem. I have a compaq nc8000 on which everything works
fine, and it boots in about 20 seconds. Other people I know have Toshibas,
NECs, Dells and IBMs and are happy with them. My previous VAIO was a dirty
crap that I would never recommend to anybody though.

Everyone has different needs, that's all.
Sorry, but I fell like we're becoming a bit off-topic here.
