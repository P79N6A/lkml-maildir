If you are just talking the pid of the init process the problem seems
tractable.
Where I see real problems with migration is and nested pid spaces
is when you expose all of your pids to your parent, and perhaps
there was some miscommunication on this point.
To try and give an example.
pspace 1        pspace 2      pspace 3      pspace 4
     pid 234 ->      pid 1    
     pid 235 ->      pid 2 ->      pid 1
     pid 236 ->      pid 3 ->      pid 2 ->      pid 1
Hopefully this clearly shows what I was trying to avoid, by
only allow pid 1 of any pspace to be visible in the parent.
