Some good news.  I think it's fixed in 2.6.16-rc1-mm2.  In fact a whole boatload 
of problems I was having are fixed in this -mm release, including a nasty libata 
oops that seemed to have a few people scratching their heads.
I've now done in excess of 20 reboots with this code and haven't had either 
problem show up at all.
So for now I'll keep a record of things for a bit longer, but I guess I've 
reason to be fairly confident that both this USB/IRQ problem and my ATA/IRQ 
problem are now fixed.
It does make me wonder if the ACPI update in rc1-mm2 fixed it, and was actually 
the cause of most of my problems......it would be nice to know for sure.
Thanks,
Reuben
