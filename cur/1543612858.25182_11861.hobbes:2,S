Yes.
ip route add 10.1.1.0/24 via 192.168.1.1 src 172.16.1.1
                                         ^^^
The src parameter tells the routing code to use this address when sending
packets. The address only needs to be on the system. IE:
ip addr add 172.16.1.1/32 dev dummy0
And send the packets out of eth0.

No need for DNAT. Just routing.
