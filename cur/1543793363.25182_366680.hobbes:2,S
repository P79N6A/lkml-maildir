Subject: [ANNOUNCE][RFC] PlugSched-6.1.4 for 2.6.14 and 2.6.15-rc1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This version updates the staircase scheduler to Con's version and makes 
modifications to the interactive bonus mechanisms in spa_ws and zaphod 
to use interactive sleepiness instead of ordinary sleepiness.
A patch for 2.6.15-rc1 is available at:
<
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cpuse/plugsched-6.1.4-for-2.6.15-rc1.patch?download>
and a patch to upgrade the 6.1.3 version for 2.6.14 to 6.1.4 is
available at:
<
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cpuse/plugsched-6.1.3-to-6.1.4-for-2.6.14.patch?download>
Very Brief Documentation:
You can select a default scheduler at kernel build time.  If you wish to
boot with a scheduler other than the default it can be selected at boot
time by adding:
cpusched=<scheduler>
to the boot command line where <scheduler> is one of: ingosched,
nicksched, staircase, spa_no_frills, spa_ws, spa_svr or zaphod.  If you
don't change the default when you build the kernel the default scheduler
will be ingosched (which is the normal scheduler).
The scheduler in force on a running system can be determined by the
contents of:
/proc/scheduler
Control parameters for the scheduler can be read/set via files in:
/sys/cpusched/<scheduler>/
