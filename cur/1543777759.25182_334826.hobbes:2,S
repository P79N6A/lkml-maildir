Subject: Re: [RFC][PATCH - 1/12] NTP cleanup: Move NTP code into ntp.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi!
> 	This patch moves the generic NTP code from time.c and timer.c into
> ntp.c. It makes most of the NTP variables static providing more
> understandable interfaces like ntp_synced() and ntp_clear(). 
> 
> Since some of the newly made static variables are used in arch generic
> code, this patch alone will not compile. Thus this patch requires part 2
> of the series which fixes the arch specific uses of the newly static
> variables.
> 
> Any comments or feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Should this be inline in header somewhere?
