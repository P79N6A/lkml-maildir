Sorry, I missed your message, I have picked the patch from git and works as
expected.
I still have the audio problems with skype when using the oss interface, but
I have not been able to reproduce them with any other program, I guess this
could be either the alsa drivers (I tested 1.0.12rc1 but the result was the
same as with 1.0.11rc4 from 2.6.17) or even the libs (I'm using debian's sid
1.0.11-7), even though the problem happens when I use 2.6.17 and doesn't
happen if I use 2.6.16.
Thanks for your help.
Regards...
