Doesn't work that well in cases where information is quite variable-length,
e.g. drivers/atm/eni.c:eni_proc_read. Besides, all of the /proc/atm files
are meant to be human-read, so the usual formatting policy is "try to stay
within 80 columns, but overflow if necessary". One would have to \0-pad in
order to get this, which is probably worse than funny file positions.
IMHO, seeking to non-zero positions in /proc is a little bogus anyway,
because many files have sufficiently variable content that you can't
really tell where you might end up.
Would be nice if once could flag /proc as non-seekable and make them
appear as pipes, though.
