Actually, the whole R2x0 family seems to be largely supported by the DRI
drivers.
The newer cards just need a recent enough DRI server to know about them,
but they should otherwise be ok.
It's the R300-based cards (ATI 9800 & friends) that apparently don't get
any open-source 3D acceleration right now.
(But hey, I may be wrong - I follow the DRI stuff only sporadically).
