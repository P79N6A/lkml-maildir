If you compile a SHA-1 signature directly into the kernel, yes.
Alternatively, you could for instance allow it to be set once and only
once upon boot.

See modprobe. We already have that sort of dependency.

You have to verify the module _after_ it has been loaded into the
kernel, but before any code has been run. No difference there between a
userspace and a kernel space solution.

I assume so.

Umm... No unnecessary junk in the kernel when you are not loading in
modules? Greater possible choice of signing mechanisms? Support for
revoking signatures?
