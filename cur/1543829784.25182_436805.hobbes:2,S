That's mine, not Mike's. Mike's patch removed the #ifdef CONFIG_SMP
around update_process_times() in smp_local_timer_interrupt().

Hm, doesn't that mean that mean that hardirq accounting is still broken?
APIC irq comes in, increases hardirq count, then the timer irq fires,
switches the stack and looses the hardirq count that was incremented by
the APIC irq.
I just booted with both patches applied, mine and Mike's, and that
actually makes a difference in hardirq cpu time accounting. With my
patch only, hi is 0 in top while the box gets a ping flood. With both
patches, I get about 1% hi. Mike's patch causes update_process_times()
to be called twice on UP, but that alone shouldn't change the
percentages, right?
OTOH top shows "hi" as zero with 8K stacks as well unless Mike's patch
is applied, so the results with Mike's patch are bogus (if so, why?) or
hardirq accounting is broken in general.
Btw, which path do apic irqs go? I stumbled across the nmi stuff, but
didn't see anything special for the apic irqs.
