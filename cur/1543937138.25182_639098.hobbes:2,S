I want named choices, too, but for a different purpose (and not
unconditionally): Currently, a choice really can just be a selection
between individual boolean settings or (as the current intended
extension) a mixture of boolean and tristate values. String or
numerical values aren't permitted (and iirc they even cause the config
process to crash). Nevertheless there are a couple of example where
choosing between individual string or numeric values is intended (but
needs to be made work with the current infrastructure, meaning that
one first chooses between boolean values and then selects (or sets
through default values in prompt-less config options) the intended
string or numeric value.
What you want seems much more fundamental a change, and as I
understand it you really want the name just as a name space
separation mechanism.

That you be done with
if X86 || PPC
source foo/bar/Kconfig
endif
then, I would think (which should be the default anyway if you want a
Kconfig covering all architectures).
