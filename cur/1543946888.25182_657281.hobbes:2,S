 Strange that it has been disabled, I used to keep an eye to avoid touching
 anything outside of drivers/rtc .
 the rtc subsystem creates the device dynamically, you shouldn't count
 on having 254,0. I would eventually ack a patch that adds
 /dev/rtc at 10,135 as an alias for /dev/rtc0.
 however the best solution would be to upgrade hwclock.
