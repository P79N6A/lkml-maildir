I get a large number of warnings like the following when compiling
2.2.18:
{standard input}:338: Warning: using `%eax' instead of `%ax' due to `l'
suffix
I'm using the compiler from RedHat 6.2:
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/egcs-2.91.66/specs
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)
