When the readahead window gets closed,the code goes into slow-read mode.
In this mode, all requests are broken to page-size. Hence a 16k request
gets broken into 4  4K-requests. This continues to the point where
enough number of sequential i/os are requested(i.e around ra->ra_pages
number of pages), at which point the readahead window gets
re-activated.  
Looking at it the other way, without readahead code, all requests
satisfied through 4k i/os.  Readahead helps in generating larger size
i/os.
