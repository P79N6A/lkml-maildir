Just browsing the diff between my patch and Stephen's, I have
a couple of questions.
< static int			suspends_pending; /* = 0 */

> static int			suspends_pending;
Is it not good practice to note when the code _assumes_ zero-
initialization?  I have seen comments like these elsewhere in
the kernel sources.
< 	static int use_apm_idle; /* = 0 */
< 	static unsigned int last_jiffies; /* = 0 */
< 	static unsigned int last_stime; /* = 0 */

Are static variables defined within functions not initialized
to zero at load time, as global static variables are?
< 			ignore_sys_suspend = 0;
---
> 			waiting_for_resume = 0;
Don't you think "ignore_sys_suspend" is a name more consistent
with the other "ignore_yadda_yadda" variable names?  Minor issue.
Everything else looks good to me.

The kernel compiles fine with your patch; I'll test over the
next few days.
Thanks
