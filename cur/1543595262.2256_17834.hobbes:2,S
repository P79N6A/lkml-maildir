Actually I think the just one very good reason to use gcc 3.0 is if you
are programming using C++. It's a kind of paradise for C++ programmers.
So I had to install it on my servers used by C++ programmers, they were
so happy...
To use C, it's better to avoid gcc 3.0, it's just slower.
All bench i did, it's slower about 3/5% depending on the kind of code.
It is faster just on some floating point with really small
code, (I used optimizzations for athlon CPU).
