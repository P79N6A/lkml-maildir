Message is what I should have said.

Which is just fine, does it need to be one or the other. SOCK_DGRAM an be
both connection oriented or connectionless.

Other RPC types use normal socket types.

So you want SOCK_SEQPACKET perhaps then ?

Perhaps someone with AIX boxes around (say @ibm.com) could answer ?
