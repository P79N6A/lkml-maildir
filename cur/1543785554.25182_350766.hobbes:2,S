hello again!
continuing exploring linux kernel networking...
in function sys_socketcall() why cannot I read using gdb the message being transmitted in args[] array (i suppose it must be in (char*)args[1])
I cannot do it neither before copy_from_user() (directly from (char*)args[1])
nor after (from a1 variable)
at long last, where is that dear message??????
using UML kernel 2.4.25 and gdb
thank you
