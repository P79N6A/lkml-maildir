Do you think the "fix headers_check" patches spend lots of time analyzing 
things? I bet no. They just try to make the warning go away, so you don't 
actually end up with any more "coverage" anyway. Quite the reverse - 
instead of having a simple rule ("CONFIG_xyz options simply do not exist 
in user space"), you end up having ad-hoc hacks on a per-fix basis.
