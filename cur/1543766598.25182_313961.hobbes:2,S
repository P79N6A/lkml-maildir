What would you think about a general hack to let given fixup table entries
say the code wants the trap and error info made available (pushed on the
stack or whatever)?  Conversely, would there be any harm in always setting
->thread.error_code and ->thread.trap_no for a kernel trap?  
Thanks,
Roland
