Okay. I did not know that. Now I satisfied ;-). But, I think a "miss": the 
webmaster of kernel.org could link the signature of all kernel files (?). 
That is, could we have got something like:
The latest stable version of the Linux kernel is:  	2.6.5 	2004-04-04 04:17 
UTC 	F 	V 	VI 	C 	Changelog SIGN
where SIGN links to 2.6.5 signature?
Sorry, but I think that the reference to signature page in kernel.org is not 
of all visible. It's in a more low possition, I think.
Sorry for ask that,
Xan.
