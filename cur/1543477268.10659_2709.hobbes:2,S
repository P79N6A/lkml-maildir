  Hello.
  I've probably found a bug in loop device. The problem is that when I
have a sparse file mounted through loop device and I write something
into the sparse space the data didn't get written (ok, the block is
written but it contains only zeroes). In 2.1.117 everything is OK in
2.1.130 I can reproduce the problem and in 2.2.0pre6 too. Here is
what am I doing:
root@lemming:/home/root# dd if=/dev/zero of=test.fs seek=8192 count=1
1+0 records in
1+0 records out
root@lemming:/home/root# mke2fs test.fs
mke2fs 1.10, 24-Apr-97 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
test.fs is not a block special device.
Proceed anyway? (y,n) y
Linux ext2 filesystem format
Filesystem label=
1024 inodes, 4096 blocks
204 blocks (4.98%) reserved for the super user
First data block=1
Block size=1024 (log=0)
Fragment size=1024 (log=0)
1 block group
8192 blocks per group, 8192 fragments per group
1024 inodes per group
Writing inode tables: done
Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done
root@lemming:/home/root# du -k test.fs
150     test.fs
^^^ Here you can see the file is sparse and only space for basic filesystem
data is allocated.
root@lemming:/home/root# mount -t ext2 -o loop test.fs /mnt
root@lemming:/home/root# echo >/mnt/test This is a test.
root@lemming:/home/root# cat /mnt/test
This is a test.
root@lemming:/home/root# umount /mnt
root@lemming:/home/root# du -k test.fs
151     test.fs
^^^ Something got written. Because space for all filesystem structures was
already allocated I suppose the block got written...
root@lemming:/home/root# mount -t ext2 -o loop test.fs /mnt
root@lemming:/home/root# cat /mnt/test
root@lemming:/home/root#
...but as you can see with bad data (the directory and inode itself are OK).

I don't suppose my configuration is involved but just for sure:
I'm running 2.2.0pre6 on K6/200 with 64MB of RAM.
