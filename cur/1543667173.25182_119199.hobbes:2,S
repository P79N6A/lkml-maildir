Hi,
it seems your "oss sound cli cleanup" patch that was included into 2.5 
some months ago has caused the following problem:
The final linking of the kernel fails with the following error:
<--  snip  -->
...
sound/built-in.o(.text+0x2dc86): In function `write_mix':
: undefined reference to `lock'
sound/built-in.o(.text+0x2dc91): In function `write_mix':

sound/built-in.o(.text+0x2dcd1): more undefined references to `lock' 
follow
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
The following patch fixes the problem for me, please check whether it's 
correct:
