OK, fair enough, it does need to be more complicated than I originally
suggested, but each changeset is numbered, so presumably we could just
use that to ensure that we don't miss any.

Well, that's OK as long as we are just trying to track Linus' tree, we
don't even need to know the patch's original date.

Can't Larry just do this from bkbits, though?  That's what I don't
understand.
Maybe not for Linus' tree due to the volume of patches, but for most
other trees, a mail sent out for each commit should be no problem.
There should be no issues with locking - the mailing list shouldn't
*care* whether anybody is actually receiving the mail, it just
broadcasts the changes for everybody to see. 
John.
