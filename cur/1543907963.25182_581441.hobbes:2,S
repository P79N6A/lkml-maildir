I disagree. UIO is a documented kernel<->userspace interface, like sysfs
or proc. Using your argument, we would also have to say that a userspace
software that is unusable without sysfs is a derived work of the kernel.
But IANAL, tell me if I missed an important point.

I guess you mean this sentence:
"if you need to keep some parts of your driver closed source, you can do so 
without violating the GPL license on the kernel."
What would you write instead?
Thanks,
