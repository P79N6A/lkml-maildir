That's correct.

That's what I expected. I didn't help.
Sector 96 is a little odd.  50 1K blocks
should be sector 99. (counting starts at zero)
I wonder why 96 is accessed...
This is really starting to look like it's
*NOT* really a Mass Storage Class device,
just claiming to be. (black list time?)
I noticed the windows driver setup several
other interfaces, like audio and VfW (video).
Best sugestion for now is buy 1) a memory card,
2) a card reader that works there are several.
It probably doesn't use the internal memory if a card
is loaded, but you'd have to read the manul/test to
find out. 8M isn't much room for pics at 1280x1024
any way :)
