ouch! cannot push SysRq?!?
do I still need my PS/2 keyboard plugged in?
(that keyboard is terribly useful because it is a USB hub... but having
the need to plug a PS/2 keyboard whenever X locks up is a waste of
forces... and a waste of keyboards)
isn't there a workaround for this??
an option in the kernel .config to hardcode sysrq-scancodes would be
fine. sorry but i never look in the deep of the kernel. if you point me
to some branch of the kernel maybe i could hack it :9
ciao!
