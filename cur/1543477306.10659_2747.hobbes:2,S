Hello,
At the moment I am trying to build a one-floppy firewall.  I haven't
found a way to boot directly from a floppy without being asked 'Insert
root floppy and press ENTER' (ramdisk_prompt only works for ramdisks).  
Hence, this patch.
By specifying 'rootfloppy' on the commandline to the kernel
(append="rootfloppy" in lilo), you can boot directly from a
ext2-formatted floppy - no questions asked.
The patch patches cleanly against the first pre 2.2.0.    It touches
init/main.c and fs/super.c ...
... and I hope it finds its way into the mainstream kernel   ;o)
Kind regards,
Brian[unhandled content-type:application/x-gzip]
