For large multi-processor systems, it isn't clear that those matter
much. On single user systems I've tried , ps -ax | wc -l usually
gives some number 50 < n < 100. For a multi-user general purpose
system, my guess would be something under 50 system processes plus
50 per user. So for a dozen to 20 users on a departmental server,
under 1000. A server for a big application, like database or web,
would have fewer users and more threads, but still only a few 100
or at most, say 2000.
So at something like 8 CPUs in a personal workstation and 128 or
256 for a server, things average out to 8 processes per CPU, and
it is not clear that process migration or any form of pre-emption
beyond the usual kernel scheduling is needed.
What combination of resources and loads do you think preemption
and migration are need for?

That matters, but it isn't entirely clear that it needs to be done
in the kernel. Things like databases and journalling filesystems
already have their own mechanisms and it is not remarkably onerous
to put them into applications where required.

I'm not sure whose definition this is:
   supercomputer: a device for converting compute-bound problems
      into I/O-bound problems
but I suspect it is at least partially correct, and Beowulfs are
sometimes just devices to convert them to network-bound problems.
For a network-bound task like web serving, I can see a large
payoff in having each OSlet doing its own I/O.
However, in general I fail to see why each OSlet should have
independent resources rather than something like using one to
run a shared file system and another to handle the networking
for everybody.
