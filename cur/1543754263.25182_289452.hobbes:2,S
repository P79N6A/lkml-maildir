Subject: [PATCH] ppc32: fix powersave with interrupts disabled
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

It looks like the problem has to do with entering the powersave routine 
with irqs disabled. Here is a patch that will only enter powersave if irqs 
are enabled.
Entering powersave on PPC while irqs are disabled causes a hang. Only 
enter powersave if irqs are disabled.
