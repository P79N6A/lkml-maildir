I did ask for some pointers in buffers/cache stuff (at the age of 2.2.1)
and did not receive any answer.
Altough is not a complaint, the lack of answers makes me think my idea
was extremely stupid. And because this information cannot be found in
books, I abandoned my little (stupid?) project which I thought it could
help me to lose my kernel virginity, which is a shame if you are 33 years
old :-))
Sometimes is hard to enter in such a big open circle. Perhaps people like
me should apply for being documentation volunteers :-)
Best regards,
