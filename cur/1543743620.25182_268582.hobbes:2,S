If PML4 is the outer page table (god I hate that confusing name) then
this is going to break ARM.
"first" needs to be able to handle being set to virtual address 0x8000
since, for some CPUs, it is absolutely vital that we keep the first
_page_ of memory mapped, but user executables are loaded at 0x8000.
Note that the PGD increment is 2MB on ARM.
