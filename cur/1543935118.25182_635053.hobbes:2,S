Hi
After physical memory upgrade from 3GB to 4GB (also it happens on 5GB) got 
kernel panic.
Because it is happening on early stage and my machine doesn't contain serial 
port, i had to take photo.
Kernel boots fine with 64GB highmem, no highmem, or highmem4G with limited 
memory by mem=3G. All dmesg attached.
Also i attach dmidecode and lspci -vvv output, probably it will be useful.
