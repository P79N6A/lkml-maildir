That's a bit unusual.  Normally a bind or unbind operation will operate
primarily upon the thing which is bound to, not upon the thing which is
bound.
I assume it makes sense this way, given the way the vt layer operates.  But
it rather rules out binding the fbcon layer to anything apart from the vt
layer (just thinking about it design-wise).
ummm, expressing it differently:
	echo "bind fbcon" > /sys/whatever/some-vt-file
	echo "unbind fbcon" > /sys/whatever/some-vt-file
would be more typical usage.

Do we have a place where this can be documented?

Right.  So the vt layer should be told to let go of the fbcon layer.  It's
a vt operation, not an fbcon one, yes?
