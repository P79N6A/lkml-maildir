I like this idea a lot (the latter - making /dev/console controlling
tty).  On an old SunOS 4 machine I once worked with, a Ctrl-C during the
execution of rc.sysinit would sent it terminate signals.  So when the
NFS was hanging on mount because of a f***ed up network (or changed ip
address of server) you could hit ctrl-c during the rc script and the
mount would be sent the ctrl-c and would terminate, then the rest of the
rc script would continue (regular shell script behavior if I'm not
mistaken).
