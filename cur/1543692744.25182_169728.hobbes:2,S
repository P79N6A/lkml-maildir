Hi!
Al, your version string cprt[] should better be in one of the .c files
and the declaration in the header be extern.  No need to keep six
seperate copies of that string in the kernel binary.
Thanks!
Al Viro: There is no maintainer for efs in the kernel MAINTAINERS
file.  Is this filesystem orphaned?
