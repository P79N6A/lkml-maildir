I think that's a bit of an extremist view.
The 2.6 rpms Arjan has posted have gotten good use, and most people seem 
to think 2.6.0-test is a _lot_ more stable than 2.4.0 was at release time.
It's certainly true that a raft of currently-unknown bugs will show up 
when distros start shipping 2.6-based distros (I think the first was 
Mandrake, as an experimental extra, soon be followed by Fedora?).  Such 
bugs always appear.
I venture to say, for the vast majority of hardware, including my 28MB 
K6-2 laptop and my P133 firewall, 2.6 works just as well as 2.4 does 
currently.
