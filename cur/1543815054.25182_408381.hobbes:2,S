I've been realizing this, too, when looking at some oprofile logs.
pmtmr reading uses almost 3% CPU time (e.g. P3/700) when idle, and it's
similarly problematic when not idle.
I think it's crazy to do a safe tripled readout (with *very* expensive I/O!)
of the PM timer unconditionally on *all* systems when only a
(albeit not that small) subset of systems is affected by buggy (un-latched)
PM timers.
I want to improve things there; I can see three ways to do it:
a) maintain a blacklist (or probably better a whitelist) of systems that
   are (not) affected
b) detect long-time timer accuracy, then switch to fast readout if timer
   is verified to be accurate (no white/blacklist needed this way)
c) give up on PM timer completely
Any comments on which way and how this could/should be done?

I don't want to comment on the first part, but adding a note to the Kconfig
text would be very useful, I think.
