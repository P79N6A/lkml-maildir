Thanks a lot, Martin (despite my silence, I really am listening and
pondering intermittently on this).  So, -aa5 shows high __down count
too, may not be any kind of accurate measure, but it's surely not good.
Mainly I'm concentrating on getting ready the next few patches
of the objrmap set for Andrew (not to be sent for a day or two).
Unless we see a plausible way forward on your SDET numbers, I
think it casts this project in doubt - but even so I do need
to focus or I'll just mess them up.
Seems as if prio tree has too high a cost there, yet we believe we
need it to handle the corner cases of objrmap.
What I want to investigate, when I'm far enough done, is the effect
of restoring i_shared_sem to the i_shared_lock it was before 2.5.57.
My fantasy is that your SDET would behave much more stably without
that as a semaphore, that prio tree just pushes it over your cliff.
It is easier to insert and remove vmas in the list than the tree,
and you can get away with leaving them in place quite often with
the list.
(Expect me to shout excitedly "Hey, the __down count has gone right
down, that proves I'm right!")
i_shared_lock changed to i_shared_sem to allow that cond_resched_lock
in unmap_vmas to solve vmtruncate latency problems?  With i_mmap and
i_mmap_shared as lists, isn't it easy to insert a dummy marker vma
and drop the lock if we need resched?  Resuming from marker after.
But, sadly, I doubt that can be done with the prio tree: Rajesh?
