Hi Chuck,
I must be missing something because I don't see _any_ trace of the
core RPC over RDMA support (xprtrdma et al), your RPC Transport
Switch, or any of the other supporting changes in mainline.  Could
you, or others, please clarify the plan for merging RPC/RDMA?

Do you mean the NFS/RDMA server code from Tom Tucker of Open Grid
Computing?  Why wouldn't this code be included?
please advise, thanks.
