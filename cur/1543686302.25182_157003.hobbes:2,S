Maybe I read too much into it.  It made me think of Jeff's previous
remarks about driver config and help being close to but split from
driver source code.  I saw (read) it as an extension of that:
a way to package all driver information neatly close together,
but in separate files.  Someone could modify the config, help, or IDs
file(s) without mucking with the driver source file(s).
