	You are certainly correct that the IP layer is a better place to implement 
authentication checksums.

	I don't follow the logic of this argument. When you receive the initial SYN, 
you'll either be able to confirm its checksum or not. Once you can confirm 
the checksum, you know that the key is the same on both ends, so there's no 
fear that a valid subsequent RST will be rejected.
	There is an issue at the connection establishment phase. If you receive a 
packet with a bad checksum, what do you do? There is some complexity here, 
but the obvious solutions work. If one end can correctly sign a packet, you 
know they will correctly accept a packet. Until you have received a packet 
whose checksum you have validated, you accept unvalidatable packets.

	It really comes down to the question of what is or isn't a valid RST and 
whether TCP option specifications have the 'right' to override other 
provisions of the TCP specification.
