Define "getting some dump". It doesn't react to anything, so I don't really
think I can easily get anything out.
When the resume works (ie. with 2.6.16, with patched 2.6.17, or with 2.6.17
without SMP), video works, but only with the -s and -p flags to s2ram (sav
VBE state and POST the video card, respectively).

I've tried from init=/bin/bash on an initramfs (which should be about the
minimal you can get); no change in behaviour. (I've already blacklisted
sdhci, since I got a tip it might be bad and I don't really need it; if I get
this to work, I'll try whitelisting it again and see if resume works with it,
but that's a different story.)
