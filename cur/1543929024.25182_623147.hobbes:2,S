I see it for fairly small directories.  Larger than what you can stuff
into an inode but less than a block (I'm not checking but fairly sure
that's the case).

Can you explain why the offset is capped and treated in an 'odd way'
at all?
+       curr_offset = filp->f_pos;
+       if (curr_offset == 0x7fffffff)
+               offset = 0xffffffff;
+       else
+               offset = filp->f_pos;
and later the offset to filldir is masked.  Is that some restriction
in filldir?
