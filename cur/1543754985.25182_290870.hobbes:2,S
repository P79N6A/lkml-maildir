From how I understand it, you'll have to have a global structure to
denote an exclusive operation and then take some additional cpumask_t
representing the spinlocks set and use it to iterate over when doing a
PI chain operation.
Locking of each individual parametric typed spinlock might require
a raw_spinlock manipulate lists structures, which, added up, is rather
heavy weight.
No only that, you'd have to introduce a notion of it being counted
since it could also be aquired/preempted  by another higher priority
thread on that same procesor.  Not having this semantic would make the
thread in that specific circumstance effectively non-preemptable (PI
scheduler indeterminancy), where the mulipule readers portion of a
real read/write (shared-exclusve) lock would have permitted this.

Is our attempt at getting real shared-exclusive lock semantics in a
blocking lock and may still be incomplete and buggy. Igor is still
working on this and this is the latest that I have of his work. Getting
comments on this approach would be a good thing as I/we (me/Igor)
believed from the start that this approach is correct.
Assuming that this is possible with the current approach, optimizing
it to avoid CPU ping-ponging is an important next step
