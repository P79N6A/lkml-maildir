enums are easy  putting direct references would be annoying, but I also 
argue it's potentially broken and wrong to store and export that 
information publicly anyway.  The use of enums instead of pointers is 
practically required because there is a many-to-one relationship of ids 
to board information structs.

That ignores the people who also need to get at the data, which must 
first be compiled from C into object code, then extracted via modutils, 
then turned into a computer readable form again, then used.
