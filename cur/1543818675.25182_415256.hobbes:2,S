I think the root of the problem is that "make oldconfig" doesn't give 
any warning when options are removed. So there's no warning that 
iptables is gone, because the help for the new options doesn't tell you 
"replaces XXXX" even if you as for help.
Suggestion: how hard would it be to have some extra value like y/n/m 
which says print the help even though the option is gone? That would be 
a reasonable thing to do for a version or two after things go away, and 
certainly lower cost than having testers ask questions, rebuild kernels, 
or just go away mad.
