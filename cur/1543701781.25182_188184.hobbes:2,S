Can you do /proc/slabinfo too?
Clearly the memory leak isn't in the page cache, so the most likely source 
is network buffers, and most likely in iptables connection tracking or 
similar. If you actually _use_ IPv6, then that is also more likely to have 
leaks just due to less testing.
David & co fixed a number of leaks just before 2.6.0-final, but that 
doesn't mean that they are all gone - rather it means that there 
definitely were still leaks around just a few weeks ago.
