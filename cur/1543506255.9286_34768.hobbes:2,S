This sounds like the best option I've heard. Just to expand on this a bit,
maybe there should be some way to register an email address to get approved to
post to linux-kernel without actually subscribing. 
A sort of 'half-subscription' option for people who post to linux-kernel, but
don't want to receive linux-kernel email (people with more than one email
address who are already subscribed on one especially).
Anyone who is subscribed or registered to post bypasses moderators while those
unregistered hit moderators. I'm not too sure how this mailing list works, but
when a moderated post is denied, a bounce message should be generated as some
mailing list software will automatically unsubscribe a person on bounce.
