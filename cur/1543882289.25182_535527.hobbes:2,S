Interesting. Why would that boundary be of relevance to the compiler? Some 
offset heuristics?

Likely a backend optimization issue.

Yes but that has always been the case. We want to reduce kmalloc for 
constants at compile time to use the appropriate kmalloc cache. If kmalloc 
does not use a constant then we will do run time determination of the 
kmalloc cache.
The code in SLAB is easier to fold since it does not use a subroutine call.
We could simply #ifdef out the __kmalloc_sizes_too_large for ppc and let 
it fall back to __kmalloc? That would mean only that kmallocs >32k 
would require an additional determination of the kmalloc cache at run 
time.
But then how important is gcc 3.3 support?
