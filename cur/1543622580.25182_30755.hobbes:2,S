I'm using 2.4.18-rc4+most of the -aa patches.
nvidia works fine for me -
There are patches available that will break
the nvidia driver without warning, but that's
the problem with a binary driver - you have
to be careful about what patches you apply,
and you will lag the bleeding edge in some
areas because of driver compatibility issues.
