I have removed the "implementation" field for now. It is only useful if 
Oprofile is implemented on top of perfmon2. It is used by Oprofile
tools to detects which interface to use so that they can be used with
older kernels as well. But for now, I am shooting for Oprofile using
its own kernel code and /dev/oprofile interface. That will provide
for a smoother transition.
