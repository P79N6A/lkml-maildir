There are also some older systems where if the block transfer of the IDE
data didn't keep up with the controller instead of handshaking properly
it kind of dribbled random numbers onto the disk.
Unless anyone knows of PCI era devices with this problem I would be
inclined to agree that we should default to IRQ unmasking in the 2.5 IDE
code if the IDE controller is PCI.
For old ISA/VLB controllers its safer left as is, and nobody running a
machine like that can realistically expect good performance without hand
tuning stuff anyway
