I found following in patch-2.2.0-pre7:
+{"IBM","DPES-","*", BLIST_NOTQ | BLIST_NOLUN},
  Vendor: IBM       Model: DPES-31080    !t  Rev: S31K
  Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Detected scsi disk sda at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
ncr53c810-0-<0,0>: tagged command queue depth set to 8
I'm wondering why the disk above works with tagged command queuing since ages.
In the pre-7 patch it was only for the DPES-31080, rev S31Q, but now
it's for every DPES drive (or do I misunderstand something ?). Who thinks
it's a good idea to blacklist every DPES drive ?
Thomas.

   This device has completely bogus header. Compaq scores again :-|
It's a host bridge, but it should be called ghost bridge instead ;^)
