I have converted my fonts by hand (with a GW-BASIC proggy) from bitmap
to .c, though not the SUN fonts for ISO but the PC fonts for cp437.
I did this because I do not like e.g. the glyph "0" in standard font
and included the "Euro" sign. (I use the same for DOS and Linux now,
and even Windoze recently got it as Terminal font!)
My second suggestion: code it as .psfu and load it by setfont, including
the appropiate console-map. AFAIK all the kernel default fonts are cp437
(linux/drivers/char/cp437.uni; consolemap.*)
