Much better - thanks.
Yes. For "make O=..." builds we need to refer to the file in
the srctree. include/asm/... is not pointing back to the original tree.
So I had to use:
if [ -f ${srctree}/include/asm-${ARCH}/ignore_syscalls ]; then
	cat ${srctree}/include/asm-${ARCH}/ignore_syscalls
fi
To make it work.
I will push this change out during the weekend I hope.
