Here is my take on it (now that I have skimmed the TrackPint spec) -
transparent mode is to be used only when querying the external device.
This way trackpoint does not interfere with data stream at all and the
kernel gets a chance to know exactly whta is behing the trackpoint -
Logitech, explorer, something more exotic... Once identification is
done transparent mode should be cancelled.
Bit 3 can be used to de-multiplex 2 streams; hopefully trackpoint is
able to rely packets longer than 3 bytes from the external device.
As far as I can see there is no point of exporting transparent mode to
the userspace via sysfs. I also do not think that we need to export
middle_button_disable as it is "..for compatibility with older
software expecting this bit be always 0" and we do not have such an
issue. Also, if we implement pass-through port, then ext_dev is also
not needed since user can either unbind the driver from pass-through
port or just ignore the secondary input device in his/her config.
