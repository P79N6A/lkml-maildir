Urgghhh....  So maybe I have gone full circle.
If you want to do transparent migration and checkpointing
of statically linked binaries, then you need
to intercept system calls.
An "interposition device driver" is a fairly nice and easy
thing to do here - e.g. one that invokes arbitrary added
code when a system call is done.  This code might be:
in the kernel (gack); in a separate process, when it really
amounts to "debug breakpoint on trap", where it will be
too slow for many applications, but fast enough for some
(such as the simulations I run); or perhaps using code/data
memory added to the original program as transparently
as possible.
This is a special case of intercepting an arbitrary API.
It is not as general. But it is more universally reliable
than the binary editting approach. It will work with
just about any binary, including statically linked binaries,
and binaries that do wierd things like dynamically writing
code to invoke system calls - e.g. it might allow transparent
checkpointing and migration of things like a Java VM with
JIT compilation.  Such completeness is good.
I apologize to Werner, for having said that such interposition
should not be in the kernel.  My excuse is that I keep looking
for that "single point of leverage". In this case, it appears that
there are three main points of leverage: (1) a kernel syscall
interposition layer, (2) jump table editting, and (3) binary editting.
All have their respective advantages and disadvantages. None
is uniformly more powerful than the other.
So, back to where we started: is there a kernel syscall interposition
driver for LINUX?  Another respondent implied that there might be.
