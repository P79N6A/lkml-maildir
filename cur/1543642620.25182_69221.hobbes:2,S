well since most hdd's have a 5-10 year lifespan when operating in <30C 
you can see why many people's hdds are dying or having errors much 
sooner.  People are operating their hdd's in the mid 30's or higher due 
to low air circulation or just generally high ambient temperatures in 
the case.  This cuts run to error time significantly.   There was a 
chart on some hdd website that showed how long you can expect to have 
your data safe for different ranges of temperatures and it's something 
like 30-33 = 3 year ...~35C is getting close to 1 year and it just goes 
like that.  So yea, it's not surprising at all that reputations that 
used to work dont anymore as heat effects all and heat has become the 
dominating problem in today's hdds rather than simple quality of parts.
Keep your drive cool and you can expect to keep it around for a very 
long time.
