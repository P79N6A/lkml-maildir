Those numbers are suspiciously good.  No I/O involved, so I spose it makes
sense.
I suggest you test this with fsx-linux on a 1k blocksize filesystem with lots
of pageout pressure happening.  With a combination of mmapped writes and
write()s.

I worry about this:

We're setting SetPageMappedToDisk here if all the buffers are uptodate. 
But that doesn't mean they're mapped to disk!  They could be over file
holes and they were brought uptodate with memset.
Are you really sure that we're clearing PageMappedToDisk in all the right
places?  Truncate...

Yipes.  So we're not attaching the buffers to the journal at all in this
case.  So if nothing has been physically written to the disk yet, a
crash+recovery will expose unwritten-to disk blocks.
OK, that might not happen with this patch because __block_commit_write() is
presently checking BH_uptodate rather than BH_mapped.  And a file hole will
still be a file hole after the crash+recovery.  But if
__block_commit_write() is changed to test buffer_mapped(), I _think_ we can
leak uninitialised data on recovery.
Or maybe you thought all this through and didn't tell me :(
Either way, this optimisation (not attaching the ordered-mode buffers to
the transaction) worries me.  It's largely unrelated to the
PageMappedToDisk() optimisation and should be coded and thought about
separately.  It's a significant change in ordered-mode ext3 semantics.
