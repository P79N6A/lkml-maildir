Just want to note that install_special_mappings()--used for, e.g., the
vdso--sets VM_DONTEXPAND [one of the VM_SPECIAL flags] which, if we want
to prevent merging, makes a lot of sense to me.  It appears that
get_user_pages() will balk at addresses in vmas with VM_IO [and
VM_PFNMAP] which might not be what one wants.  For example, you can't
pre-populate the ptes via make_pages_present() with this flag.
