Hi All,
Within the security folder in the kernel tree, the
2.6.20 linux kernel distribution is shipped with a
file root_plug.c (written by Greg Kroah-Hartman),
which is a classic introduction to Linux Security
Modules (LSM). The folder also contains the folder of
SELinux.
My question is that whether root_plug.c security
module is stacked with the SELinux security module or
not. If root_plug.c is stacked, where i can find the
code which handles the stacking of SELinux and
root_plug.c within the kernel.
Further, any pointer to stacking mechansims in Linux
2.6.* kernel will be highly appreciated.
Thanking you in advance,
MA
