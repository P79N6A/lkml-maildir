Hello!
I got a report that GNU Midnight Commander fails to erase some directories 
on tmpfs from the first attempt.  However, it succeeds the next time.
I could reproduce the problem on 2.4.18-pre1 compiled with gcc-2.96 from
RedHat 7.2.
I have reduced the problem to a simple test.  This script creates 
directories dir, dir/0, ... dir/168
=========================
#!/bin/sh
rm -rf dir
mkdir dir
i=0
while test $i != 169; do
  mkdir dir/$i
  i=$(($i+1))
done
=========================
And this C program tries to remove all subdirectories under "dir":
=========================
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <dirent.h>
int main()
{
    DIR *dir;
    struct dirent *d;
    if (chdir("dir") != 0)
	return 1;
    dir = opendir(".");
    if (!dir)
	return 2;
    while ((d = readdir(dir)) != NULL) {
	printf("%s\n", d->d_name);
	rmdir(d->d_name);
    }
    closedir(dir);
    return 0;
}
=========================
This program succeeds on vfat and ext3 but it fails to remove "dir/0" on 
ramfs and tmpfs.
169 is not a random number.  It's the minimal number required to reproduce 
the problem.  Maybe other systems need another value.
Basically, removing a subdirectory in a directory open with opendir() 
causes an entry (file or directory) 168 entries later to be skipped by 
readdir().
I'm sorry, I cannot elaborate more, but the issue seems to be very 
serious.
