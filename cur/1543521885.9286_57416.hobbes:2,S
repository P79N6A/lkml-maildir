Hi,
	Does anybody know of how to setup a remote console on linux. The
	documentation talks about setting up a serial console. i am trying to
	get linux on a box thats only got a serial port. i have setup the
	machine with a null-modem cable and have connected it to the serial
	port of another machine running linux (both running  2.2.15). But how
	do i get the printk messages and the console messages on the other box.
Thanks,
Govindan
