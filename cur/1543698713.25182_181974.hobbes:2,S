Hello,
   The above combination results in an endless loop during kernel boot, 
filling the screen with:
      Posted write buffer flush took more than 3 seconds
      Posted write buffer flush took more than 3 seconds
      Posted write buffer flush took more than 3 seconds
   The board uses Serverworks Serverset III HE-SL.  Is there a BIOS 
config or patch that gets around this ?
   Thanks,
   Michael
