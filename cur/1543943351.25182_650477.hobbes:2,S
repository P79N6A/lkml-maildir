Subject: [PATCH 00/11] RFC: Kconfig changes for NFS_FS and NFSD
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/8/293

Scratching my head to find an appropriate mailing list for review of some
proposed NFS-related Kconfig changes.  These have already seen some light
on linux-nfs, but Herbert Xu suggested lkml for review by Kconfig experts.
In addition to updating the help text, I've tried to untangle the entry
dependencies somewhat.  I'm not really a Kconfig expert, so I'd appreciate
some review of these patches by those more knowlegeable than me.
