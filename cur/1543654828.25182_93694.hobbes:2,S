Let me know if you find any problems at all.  I'll try to
address them.
I think the biggest "imperfection" is just the coding style of
the whole driver.  I might submit some patches over time to clean
up coding style.
The next problem is that it doesn't handle media errors yet.
If you have a read or write failure because a sector on your disk
is bad, it fails the entire read or write. With all the coalescing
of requests that the block layer does, this might fail ALL of a
really large transfer just because one sector is bad.
I'm working on a patch that retries failures section at a time,
so that the failure will be more closely limited to the sector 
that is bad.
