Subject: Large IDE drive: overflow on # of cylinders?

I have a new Maxtor 93652U8 hard disk (~36.4 GB).  It appears to have an
actual geometry of 70780/16/63.  Unfortunately, the Linux kernels I have
tried accessing the drive with  (2.2.5? & 2.2.10) are reporting the
number of cylinders as 5244 (==70780-65536) with obviously bad results.
I have tried the trick of changing the cylinder &  head numbers in the
BIOS to 35390/32/63 but this hasn't helped any... I still get 5244 for
the number of cylinders.
Is there a work around for this?  A fix in 2.3 kernels?
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
TIA,
seregon
