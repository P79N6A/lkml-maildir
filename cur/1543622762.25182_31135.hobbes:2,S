I'll add a "me too" to this - 2.4.18, iptables 1.2.4
Setting up IPv4 mangle rules:
iptables: libiptc/libip4tc.c:384: do_check: Assertion `h->info.valid_hooks == (1 << 0 | 1 << 3)' failed.
/etc/fw-ipv4/mangle: line 2:   215 Aborted                 iptables -t mangle -F
iptables: libiptc/libip4tc.c:384: do_check: Assertion `h->info.valid_hooks == (1 << 0 | 1 << 3)' failed.
/etc/fw-ipv4/mangle: line 3:   216 Aborted                 iptables -t mangle -X
iptables: libiptc/libip4tc.c:384: do_check: Assertion `h->info.valid_hooks == (1 << 0 | 1 << 3)' failed.
/etc/fw-ipv4/mangle: line 15:   217 Aborted                 iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -d xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/xx -j ACCEPT
... lots more ...
The rules do appear to be in the kernel however.
iptables 1.2.4 was rebuild for the 2.4.17 because it stopped working at
that point.  I hope it isn't requirement to rebuild iptables against each
stable kernel release.
