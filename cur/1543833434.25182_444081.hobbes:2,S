As I am one of the probably few people who have some PCMCIA-IDE-drive (Sony 
PCGA-CD51/A), running 2.6.18-rc1 gives me no problems.
pccard: PCMCIA card inserted into slot 0
kernel: cs: memory probe 0xa0000000-0xa0ffffff: clean.
pcmcia: registering new device pcmcia0.0
Probind IDE interface ide2...
hde: TOSHIBA CD-ROM XM-7002Bc, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
ide2 at 0x180-0x198,0x386 on irq 3
ide-cs: hde: Vpp = 0.0
pcmcia: Detected deprecated PCMCIA ioctl usage from process: hald
Seems fine. I can mount and read it w/o problems.
$ rpm -q pcmciautils
pcmciautils-012-11 (SUSE Linux 10.1)
CONFIG_ISA=y
# CONFIG_RESOURCES_64BIT is not set
Just 2¢, ask for more if needed :)
