Well, it's a recursive down_read. It could be ok if we had the guarantee
that nobody else would be doing down_write in the middle. lockdep only
complained about this recursive down_read when there was a down_write
actually causing the deadlock, but it didn't say anything about this
down_write in the log.
It would be great if lockdep could say "recursive read-lock is
deadlocking because this other guy (with its backtrace) took for write
in the middle". I needed sysrq-t to get this info.
