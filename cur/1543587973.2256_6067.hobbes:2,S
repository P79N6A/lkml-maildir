Can we expect people adding entries in Configure.help to not write
URLs followed by a period in the future? I do not think so.
Would it not be better to teach your URL extractor (as I guess that
is the reason for this patch) what a URL followed by a period and a
space looks like. Even though they are legal URLs, I think we can
safely assume the writer intended the period to end the sentence and
not be part of the URL. The same goes for URLs followed by other
characters like comma, colon and so on.
