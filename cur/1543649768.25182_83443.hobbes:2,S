I have a few identical systems exhibiting the same problems where
I already know that the ATA-100 cable is installed backwards.  What
I am trying to find out is whether the errors I am seeing are related
or if I have two problems.
1:  With the IDE cable reversed hdparm shows the max and effective
    udma2 which slows the system (of course).
2:  IO Errors using reiserfs on a brand new hard drive:
    A:  create a partition and mkfs -treiserfs with no reported errors
    B:  mounting the new fs reports the following:
          kernel: ReiserFS version 3.6.25
          loadbase: mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock 
             on /dev/hda5,
          loadbase:        or too many mounted file systems
          kernel: hda: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
          kernel: hda: dma_intr: error=0x40 { UncorrectableError }, 
             LBAsect=106988451, sector=105381888
          kernel: end_request: I/O error, dev 03:05 (hda), sector 105381888
          kernel: reiserfs_read_super: unable to read bitmap
    C:  Removing the drive and installing it on a correctly built system
        and scanning it for bad sectors reports uncorrectable ECC errors
        at the same LBA.
So, is it possible that I am physically damaging the drive when the IDE
cable is installed with the wrong end at the host?
