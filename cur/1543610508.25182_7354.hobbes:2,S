	Clue alert...
	The PRIMARY link goes to vmlinuz.  The backup links go to the
specific versions (the install script even facilitates this for you
by installing it there).  That way, when you end up with a radioactive
version, you can boot your prior version and recover from the disaster.

	I typically keep 4 to six fall back versions in each of the
2.2 and 2.4 lines active and want (or occasionally need) to target specific
versions, especially when I'm testing preX kernels and my device driver.
You are way TOO simple.
