OK, I took the plunge and dove into the code.  Here is what I've
discovered so far.
scsi_scan_host_selected: <1:4294967295:4294967295:4294967295>
scsi scan: INQUIRY pass 1 to host 1 channel 0 id 0 lun 0, length 36
ata1: command 0xa0 timeout, stat 0xd0 host_stat 0x1
scsi scan: INQUIRY failed with code 0x2
I don't yet know why the DVD burner is failing on the scsi INQUIRY
command.  Does anybody have any ideas?
I plan to keep looking.
Thanks,
Andy
