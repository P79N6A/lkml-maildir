For reference, here are the original comments from Linus which were used 
to conceive LSM:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-security-module&m=98706471912438&w=2
In a nutshell, Linus did not want to have to choose a security model.
In my view, the generic, correctly abstracted mechanism was actually 
SELinux all along, and unfortunately, only a few people really understood 
that then.  SELinux was itself designed to allow different security models 
to be composed, with clean separation of models, policy and enforcement 
mechanism.
LSM was somewhat designed around SELinux, but necessarily lacking the 
stronger semantics of SELinux, to allow other similar schemes to be 
plugged in (the first significant example of which other than SELinux, has 
only just appeared on lkml five years later).
