My TCP may be getting hazy but with latency, TCP may limit the amount of
packets 'in flight'. I think this is called the 'cwnd', congestion window. I
also seem to recall that this window is limited to the actually negotiated
TCP window size.
But here I leave this discussion as I've swapped out the finer details of
congestion windows to the Stevens books which other's have probably read
more recently than I did.
