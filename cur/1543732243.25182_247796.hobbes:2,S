Large cost on its own. The FSF would almost certainly reject such a
change until someone had written portable emulation of the feature for 
every other platform which would mean vendor patches which would
essentially mean it wouldn't happen.
I know I rarely agree with Hans but I think he's right on this one, it
has to work with the existing open() API.
