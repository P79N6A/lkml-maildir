Yes, please drop pnp-do-not-stop-start-devices-in-suspend-resume-path.patch
for now.
When the PNP core requested resources for active devices, the
pnp_stop_dev() in the suspend path released the PNP core resources,
leaving the underlying driver resources orphaned.  But the patch
that made the PNP core request those resource is also gone, so
we can leave the start/stop alone.

That's a good point, thanks for pointing that out.
