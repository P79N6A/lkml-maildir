I get that too, and wasn't sure about it either. It happens irregularly,
so it's hard to debug, but often enough to be annoying.
My mouse pointer tends to warp too in the same irregular way,
no idea if that's related (it seemed to happen in an earlier kernel
version than the sticky key thing, but not sure, as I don't have this
mouse that long.)
