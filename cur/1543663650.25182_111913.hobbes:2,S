that works only if the congestion cames from multimedia apps that are
willing to cancel the timed out (now worthless) I/O, that is never the
case normally due the low I/O load they generate (usually it's apps not
going to cancel the I/O that congest the blkdev layer).
still, it's a good idea, you're basically asking to implement the cancel
aio api and I doubt anybody could disagree with that ;).
