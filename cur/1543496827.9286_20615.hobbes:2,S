Hi there,
after enjoying 2.2.* (with matroxfb) on my diskless ws, I would
like to restore my favourite console font, which is 9x16. Does
it is possible to use such a fixed font geometry, and are there 
any tools available, which converts console fonts or bfd fonts
into c source files?
Of cause, a bigger logo is welcomed, too... 
(I'm running at 1600x1200, and wouldn't mind a 200K bigger kernel)
I thing, hacking a framework around the .h format of gimp would
be the easiest approach? Does anybody have done it up to now?
Please cc me...
Have a nice day
Hans-Peter
