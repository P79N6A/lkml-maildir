I see.  I don't know teh status bits being read from the port:
				c0 = inb(PAR_STATUS(dev));
				if (c0 & 0x08) {
teh disable_irq() in that if block could be moved beyond teh second if
block, that would remove the need to re enable_irq before return OK; in
that mentioned if block.
If that is not a good thing then notice the break;  That will put you
outside of your while() block and back into the flow of the function with
irq disabled.  from there I count 3 places the function can exit with irq
disabled. Whether or not it's changed.  you could add enable_irq calls to
all of those, but you're not 100% sure that irq is disabled either :)
which may not be a good thing since when you get all the way down to case
PLIP_PK_DONE: you'll find you have an enable_irq() call again.  This would
set the irq_desc[irq].depth  count either properly or 'off by +one'
Of cours ethe current disable_irq() wouldn't catch that, it only checks
that you're not off by -1.
Maybe since that function is teh problem area you should ensure at all
return points that irq is eiterh enabled or diabled.  We know that the
state of irq is enabled at func entry (isn't it?) so why not keep a
boolean value in that function to tell us when we should make sure this
function ends with irq enabled rather than trying to build a catch-all
case in another function that serves another purpose altogether.
And I don't intend to debate, I'm just attempting to help, since this will
be running on my machine and I actually give a hoot how it's working.
Hmm.  I'm goign to recompile plip.c from 2.1.125 and see how it would act
without your fix, I think that might be what I'm still seeing, teh
function can still return OK with irq disabled. (why the heck is he
disabling it though?)

This is what I get for going to California for a month.  *sigh*
