Subject: Still long logins in new devel kernels.

Yesterday I made the jump to 2.3.48 from 2.2.14, and while I was at it I
upgraded my libc from 2.1.2 to 2.1.3.
I had noticed reports on l-k a week or 2 ago about long login times when
using newer 2.3.x kernels.  The solution was to remove the nis and
nisplus entries from the /etc/nsswitch.conf file.  Well I'm using the
sample config file that comes with libc 2.1.3 and it contains no such
entries, but I'm still seeing the long delay when trying to log into my
machine.
One thing I have noticed is I have one account without a password
(cleared in the /etc/passwd file, so it doesn't check the shadow file),
it doesn't show the login delay.
If anyone has anything they want me to try I'll give it a shot.
