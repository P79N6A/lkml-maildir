Oh? What have you got covered that AS doesn't? (I'm only reading the

Hmm, damn. Lots of stuff. I guess some of the notable ones that I've
had trouble with are OraSim (Oracle might give you a copy), Andrew's
patch scripts when applying a stack of patches, pgbench... can't
really remember any others off the top of my head.
I've got a small set of basic test programs that are similar to the
sort of tests you've been running in this thread as well.
