Sure.  SO isn't bad for the benchmark, but think of the guy trying 
to use the machine after the test finished.  It probably swapped out
a lot of other processes which is why you didn't see it swap in again.
These things weren't needed for the bench, but daily use don't
look like that.  If my big job takes a long time - no problem
if I can work on something else with nice performance.

It'd be real interesting to know wether or not the "excessive" swapping 
caused extra seeks. Readahead or simply reading more consecutive blocks 
don't hurt - while seeks do.  Perhaps this is why it didn't hurt so
much?
Also consider the multiuser aspect - punishing a memory pig with
extra swapin isn't necessarily so bad, if it keeps more memory around
for others.  Could possibly be bad for a dedicated box, but Andrea won 
on speed anyway.
