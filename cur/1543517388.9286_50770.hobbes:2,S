no, and i dont think it will ever be. The only and worst offender is the
'big kernel lock', which is much less of a problem in 2.3. We cannot
generally reschedule at points that do a lock_kernel(). Maybe we could add
a new lock_kernel_reschedule() function, but possibly you'll have to add
this to gazillion places.
there is a workaround: in reschedule_idle() whenever we wake up a RT
process we could mark all running processes as 'reschedule ASAP' (set the
need_resched flag). This guarantees that _someone_ will notice and
reschedule eventually. (an SMP kernel is never worse than a UP kernel,
latency-wise) This is only for RT tasks though. Do something like this at
the beginning of reschedule_idle():
	if (policy != SCHED_OTHER)
		for (i = 0; i < smp_num_cpus; i++) {
			cpu = cpu_logical_map(i);
			tsk = cpu_curr(cpu);
			tsk->need_resched = 1;
		}
	/* continue doing the normal idle reschedule part */
(this is of course an ugly hack, but if it makes a difference we can see
how this could be done cleanly. It only affects RT tasks.)
