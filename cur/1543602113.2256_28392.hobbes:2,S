Well, it's also fun to log in to a Solaris 2.5.1 ksh (which doesn't talk
bind, but just alias and soft-keys) from a Linux xterm which sends funny
Esc [3~ sequences. You can "fix" that with "Del sends Del", but you then
end up having either Del and Backspace both do Backspace or have their
meanings reversed from what the "left array" on the Backspace key
suggests. The Linux TTYs behave the same way (sending Esc [3~), and you
don't easily fix that without confusing EOF detection or things.
As appreciable a solution to consistently make "Delete" do
"delete-forward" and "Backspace" do "delete-backward" would be, as low
are the chances to get this done before the year 2039.
