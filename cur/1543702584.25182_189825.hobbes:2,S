I just dumped the backup I made from jaz to the nfs.  I found out that some
things didn't get backed up.  I did multiple backups and one file was larger
than the last (for the same filesystem).
Once I copyied to nfs (which did *NOT* crash it), I ran md5sum on both nfs
copy and jaz copy.  both were exact same.  then I copyied from nfs to nfs.
The size was about 350mb.  (Quite surprised about the jaz drive performance
=)

In the above case, still was booted with init=/bin/sh and did not lockup.  I
did several tar backups.  Sometimes I got a segmentation fault and killed
tar, other times I got my shell killed.
I have not tried enabling TCP yet.  I'm going to try a 2.4 kernel soon.  (I
want to stay with 2.6 since I have a DVD+RW drive)

As stated above, one of the filesystems did not completely backup.

I have not retrieved this yet.

I have done several gig of transfers to the 2.4 server.  I was burning a
bunch of data from nfs to dvd+r.
In the tests I did above, I ran dmesg several times, Not once did I see an
oops.  I'm not sure, I may have a hardware problem (It's going to be
replaced soon anyway)
