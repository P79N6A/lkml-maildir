i apologies for the retard in my response but i have so much work in my
job...
i think the problem is in "rtc module not found": in that way it's
possible that the kernel wouldn't see the timer to stop my keyboard
repeat?
if so, please, let me know where i can find information to try to solve
the problem.
(i also apologies for my bad english!) ;))
thanks
