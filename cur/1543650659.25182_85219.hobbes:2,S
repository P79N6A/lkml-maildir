It's not that it does regularly, it's that it can, and if it does, it's
not really a gcc bug from what I recall.  So I don't think CONFIG_TINY
should prefer -Os over -O2 but instead we should just ask the user what
level of optimization they want.  Remember, one of the real important
parts of embedded systems is flexibility.
