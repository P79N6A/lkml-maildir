Maybe we have different definitions of "exception" and possibly different 
definitions of what can be considered an "OS" but Windows NT drivers use 
exceptions(+handlers) all over the place. - The code is full of RtlUnwind 
calls as well modifications to exception handler lists (usually addition of 
handler on function entry and removal on function exit).
Just my 2p.

P.S. I am not saying that exceptions are good or bad, just that they exist 
in Windows, whether you consider it an OS or not...
P.P.S. Flames to /dev/null...
