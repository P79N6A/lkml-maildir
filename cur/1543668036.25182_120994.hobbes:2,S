Yeah. It should also probably use "in_atomic()" instead of 
"in_interrupt()", since that also finds people who have marked themselves 
non-preemptible.
So what the test SHOULD look like is this:
	if (gfp_mask & __GFP_WAIT) {
		if (in_atomic() || irqs_disabled()) {
			static int count = 0;
			...
		}
	}
which should catch all the cases we really care about.
