 okay.
 first thing:
 1) assuming that the DROP rule issue is one that cannot be avoided,
    and that a rules design policy of "deny everything and only allow
	specifics" is required, then checking on the _full_ pathname
	of the program is required.
 second thing:
 2) it _is_ possible to hunt through the selinux policy macros to
    remove the execute permission on binaries that a user drops into
	their home directory, or copies into their home directory.

Truth, honesty and respect are rare commodities that all spring from

around you, funnily and coincidentally enough, life gets a lot better.
