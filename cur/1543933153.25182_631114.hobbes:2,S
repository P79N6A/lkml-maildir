Hi All,
I have now free IBM H70 with old SSA Array (1 TB discs) and would like use it 
as a samba share.
Everythink is working except the SSA card accessing the array:
0001:40:0b.0 SSA: IBM SSA Adapter [Advanced SerialRAID/X] (rev 06)
Is there driver available for this card?
Thanks a lot for reply, I am searching more a day without any success........
Thanks a lot and Merry Christmas!
