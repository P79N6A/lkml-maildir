I don't think anyone disagreed with that (at least not me).  The only
thing I argued is that we don't need the usual flush-out period of two
stable series because this syscall never was implemented in any relead
stable kernel but rather a much shorter one so that this feature never
hits a released stable kernel.
Linus disagrees strongly so we'll have to keep this crap around for five
years - that's just yet another bit of bloat growing everyones kernel
but no irreperable damage.
