Sorry for that.
We have a zero tolerancy for bad whitespacing for the stuff under
drivers/media, so, I have a script that do a cleanup on whitespaces for
the files I touch, to avoid a propagation of whitespaces.
I didn't realized the script runned against sound/oss, fixed all those
bad whitespacing stuff there.
