I've seen a Xircom network adapter that plugs into the parallel port, its
going for just a few bucks at computer shows these days.  I'm not sure if
Linux has a driver for this adapter though.  If it does than this might be
your best option.  BTW if we do not have a driver let me know, I may pick up
a couple of these to play around with.
Also you can pick up network cards for about 10-20 bucks these days as well.
