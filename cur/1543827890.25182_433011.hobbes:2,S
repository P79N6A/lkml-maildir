I just tried it out, and fuse/uml seems it works out-of-the-box (using a
simple mount-like command) while preventing the user from crashing the
kernel "using" a corrupt fs image. If you rename the mountlo program to 
"mount" and put it un the user's path, they won't notice they're using 
fuse at all, except for not honoring fstab. (Off cause /sbin must come 
before /usr/local/bin in root's path!)
