Testers and users are most likely to run one particular arch on
one particular test bench. If individual patches are arch
separated, i think bisecting will be a little bit easier.
Thus, i would like to propose separate arch patching (x86_64/i386 mainly).
Is it possible to do that? (And even set such check in ``checkpatch''?)
You would say, why? Because current kbuild/kconfig support of builds for
whole tree.
That's because to make download, build, test and debug particular arch
more easily, i'm trying to re-think and re-do some kbuild parts. With
minimum set of files, downloaded with git one can spend less
time/bandwidth for starting testing.
