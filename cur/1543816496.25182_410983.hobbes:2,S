Ok, here's a sample of the KABI conversion and cleanup patches that I'm
proposing.  I have a few fundamental goals for these patches:
1)  The Linux kernel compiles and works at every step along the way
2)  Since most of the headers are currently quite broken with respect to
    GLIBC and userspace, I won't spend much extra time preserving
    compatibility with GLIBC, userspace, or non-GCC compilers.
3)  Everything in include/kabi will have a __kabi_ or __KABI_ prefix.
4)  Headers in include/linux that need the KABI interfaces will include
    the corresponding <kabi/*.h> header and define or typedef the
    necessary KABI definitions to the names the kernel wants.
5)  The stuff in include/kabi/*.h should always be completely independent
    of userspace/kernelspace and not require any includes outside of
    <kabi/*>.  This means that the only preprocessor symbols that we can
    assume are present are those provided by the compiler itself.
Cheers,
Kyle Moffett
