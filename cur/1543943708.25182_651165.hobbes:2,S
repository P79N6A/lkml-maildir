people might want to experiment with early debug code as well and 
include asm-x86/kgdb.h in assembly files. So i kept that, it's sensible.

yeah - i also noticed that the serial subsystem is marked "orphaned" in 
the MAINTAINERS file:
 8250/16?50 (AND CLONE UARTS) SERIAL DRIVER
 L:      linux-serial@vger.kernel.org
 W:      
http://serial.sourceforge.net
 S:      Orphan
and compared to the raw-lowlevel-serial-driver hackery that KGDB used to 
do this is a big step forward. Note that it's all dependent on 
CONFIG_KGDB.
