Fully agreed. And those are the reasons why the completely non 
professional
solutions, which I never saw in deployment of course...
like ... for example the pure hobby-student-project ClearCase are going 
to the
extent of requiring you to run their own networked filesystem if running
on Linux. They do it simply out of fun and for educational purposes and
because they where to dumb to find much easier solution which are out 
there ready
and waiting. They simply don't have to deal with something as 
exceptional as
customers. They love to spend about 10 man years to develop a reliable 
networked
filesystem which is OS minor version specific like burning money for 
heat...
OK I was just kidding. ;-)
