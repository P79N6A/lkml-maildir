Hah!
When was this?  The SIG has changed their "rules" over the years.  I remember
when you had to pay 5k$US to see the "specs" (it was like 15k$US for the
tar file of headers.)  Back then, you weren't even allowed to say "I2O"
without permission.
Personally, I think I2O is a good idea.  The I2O SIG's execution, however,
leaves everything to be desired.  (Kind of reminds me of MPEG.)
