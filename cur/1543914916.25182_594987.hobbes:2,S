Most BIOS has an option called legacy emulation, which will emulate USB
mouse as legacy mouse. BIOS is using USB before driver is loaded.
If moving BAR work, disabling BAR should work too.

If you just want to workaroud the issue at hand, I'd take the method to
not use mmcfg at probe stage.

I can confirm this is an add-in graphics card. the bfd is 00:02.0, so
it's not behind any AGP/PCI-E bridge.
