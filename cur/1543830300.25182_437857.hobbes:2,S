I guess you missed the reply to Rafael. In it, I wrote:
"XFS. Did you see Nathan's reply not long ago, confirming that it doesn't stop 
all activity if you don't freeze bdevs? That isn't critical for swsusp 
(although I guess you could end up with some filesystem inconsistency if XFS 
writes something after the atomic copy), but keeping the LRU static is 
important for suspend2."
In another email, I mentioned that trying to free memory with swap on a 
journalled filesystem is a potential deadlock situation without the 
capability of thawing kernel threads alone. You could potentially thaw all 
threads while eating memory, but then there's a greater chance of racing 
against another program that's trying to allocate memory (if you're in this 
situation, you're low on memory to start with).
Regards,
Nigel
