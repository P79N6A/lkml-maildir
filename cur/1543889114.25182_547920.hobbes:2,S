Ok, let's try it.  Send on the "only add a new device id" patches and
let's see how it works out.
But we still do reserve the right to stop doing this, if it turns out
that it causes more problems.  Rembember, -stable should not be adding
new features, and I _really_ want to keep it that way, as it's the only
way that Chris and I can stay relativly sane...
