It has. We now leave dirty pages swapcached, which means that
for certain workloads Linux 2.4 eats up much more swap space
than Linux 2.2.
On the other hand, if you almost never used swap under Linux
2.2, you probably won't be using it under 2.4 either.

For Linux 2.4, it may be better to substract a bit less,
because of the issue above.
If you have a very swap-intensive workload, you may end
up with 90% of your memory being "duplicated" in swap, in
which case this rule doesn't work.
