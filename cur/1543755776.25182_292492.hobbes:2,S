correct, i did not understand. perhaps Con didn't either. my idea was
related to:

>and sys_wakeup(tid), where suspend would just enter TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE
but more like:
    sys_suspend_and_wake (tid)
where current enters TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, and process_wakeup() is
called on tid.

no small advantage.
it has another big advantage from the user space perspective: no other
information is required apart from <tid>. no state needs to be
maintained by the system that uses this. thats a huge win over the
baroque collection of FIFOs (or futexes) that we have to look after now.
