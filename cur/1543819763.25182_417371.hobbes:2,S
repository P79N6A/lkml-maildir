sg3_utils is a package of command line utilities for sending
SCSI (and some ATA) commands to devices. This package targets
the linux kernel (lk) 2.6 and lk 2.4 series. In the lk 2.6
series these utilities (except sgp_dd) can be used with any
devices that support the SG_IO ioctl.
A subset of the utilities in this package will build on FreeBSD
and Tru64.
In this version the sg_dd, sgp_dd, sgm_dd, and sg_read
utilities have been cleaned up and expanded. sg_scan
and sg_map are now more robust when used with 2.6 kernels.
SAS (SSP) support has been improved. Various bugs have been
fixed. See the CHANGELOG for more information.
A tarball, rpm and deb can be found at (see table 2):
