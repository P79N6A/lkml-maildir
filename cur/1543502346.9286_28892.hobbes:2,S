It's a press release (and subsequent press-oriented clarification).  I
don't expect it to make sense on techie grounds --- that includes
benchmarks (which are all but meaningless even on equivalent
configurations).  Read it as marketing babble and it makes about as
much sense as any other marketing babble does.
