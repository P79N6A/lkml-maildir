Subject: [PATCH as517] driver core: Fix races in driver_detach()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Greg:
This patch is intended for your "driver" tree.  It fixes several subtle
races in driver_detach() and device_release_driver() in the driver-model 
core.
The major change is to use klist_remove() rather than klist_del() when
taking a device off its driver's list.  There's no other way to guarantee
that the list pointers will be updated before some other driver binds to
the device.  For this to work driver_detach() can't use a klist iterator,
so the loop over the devices must be written out in full.  In addition the
patch protects against the possibility that, when a driver and a device
are unregistered at the same time, one may be unloaded from memory before
the other is finished using it.
