config MVIAC3_2
        bool "VIA C3-2 (Nehemiah)"
        help
          Select this for a VIA C3 "Nehemiah". Selecting this enables usage
          of SSE and tells gcc to treat the CPU as a 686.
          Note, this kernel will not boot on older (pre model 9) C3s.
Is the one you want, I believe.
