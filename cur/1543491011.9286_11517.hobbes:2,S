Hello!
Don't know when it started, but recent versions of linux have a problem
writing the last file to a tape when using `tar` (yes I know about
--block-compress when compressing).
I threw away a lot of 8 mm tapes that were good until I found this out.
`cd / ; tar -clf /dev/st0` will complete okay. However....
`cd /new/file/system ; tar -xf /dev/st0` will fail with 'sense data extra
data not valid' and a SCSI bus reset, on the last file in the directory
tree, no matter how large the tree.
Doing `cp /dev/zero /dev/st0` works, and `cp /dev/st0 /dev/null` also
works with no errors.
A work-around of `mkdir /z ; `cp /dev/zero /z/foo ^C` to make a dummy
last directory with a junk file in it works to be able to recover
an otherwise perfect directory tree.  I believe the EOF isn't written
anymore.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
