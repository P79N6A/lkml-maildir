What will it do if I cast a pointer to unsigned long?  Or if I cast an
unsigned long to a pointer?  The kernel does both of these things, and
in a lot of places.
Part of my beef with what gcc-3 is doing is that I take a pointer,
cast it to unsigned long, do something to it, cast it back to a
pointer, and gcc _still_ thinks it's knows what I am doing.  It
doesn't.
