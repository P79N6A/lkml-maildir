Subject: [PATCH 1/1] af_packet: don't enable timestamps in mmap'ed sockets
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello folks,
I've discovered two strange behaviours (bugs?) about timestamp
generation:
1. If a program opens an AF_PACKET socket and setup a reception ring
with setsockopt(sock, SOL_PACKET, PACKET_RX_RING), timestamps are
automatically (re)enabled at the reception of every packet.
2. Setting SOL_SOCKET/SO_TIMESTAMP to 0 doesn't disables timestamp
generation. Every skb continues begin timestamped until you close the
socket that activated it.
Timestamp generation is a heavy task that is consuming more than 50% of
the CPU (using ACPI PM clock) and is currently the bottleneck in my
packet capturing application.
The attached patch removes the automatic timestamp activation, that
only mmap'ed AF_PACKET sockets perform. I known it can break user
applications, but I believe that it's the correct solution.
I will be very pleased to receive any feedback.
