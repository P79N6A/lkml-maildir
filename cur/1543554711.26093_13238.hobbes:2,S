Don't think so. My toshiba is PIIX-based, AFAIC:
root@bug:~# cat /proc/pci
  Bus  0, device   5, function  0:
    Bridge: Intel Corporation 82371AB PIIX4 ISA (rev 2).
  Bus  0, device   5, function  1:
    IDE interface: Intel Corporation 82371AB PIIX4 IDE (rev 1).
      Master Capable.  Latency=64.
      I/O at 0x1000 [0x100f].
  Bus  0, device   5, function  2:
    USB Controller: Intel Corporation 82371AB PIIX4 USB (rev 1).
      IRQ 11.
      Master Capable.  Latency=64.
      I/O at 0xffe0 [0xffff].
  Bus  0, device   5, function  3:
    Bridge: Intel Corporation 82371AB PIIX4 ACPI (rev 2).
Still, it is willing to run with RDTSC at 300MHz, 150MHz, and
40MHz. (The last one in _extreme_ cases when CPU fan fails -- running
at 40MHz is better than cooking cpu).
