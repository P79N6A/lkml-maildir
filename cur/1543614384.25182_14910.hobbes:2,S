I do have one of the perhaps buggier VIA chipsets.

It's been reliable for a long time, but it wouldn't compile an Athlon 
optimized kernel until 2.4.1x.  (Kernel would Oops at boot time unless 
compiled with CONFIG_M586=y)
It was reliable when not optimized for Athlon.

With the patch, it still hangs on this system.  I recompiled with
CONFIG_NOHIGHMEM=y and CONFIG_M586=y, but that ended up with all processes 
in "b" state during dbench 32 too.
I tried unpatched 2.5.2-pre1 on a k6-2.  dbench 32 hung similarly with 
32 in "b", bo and bi = 0, and id = 100.  That machine is ill now and can't
find "init" when booting, boot single, or boot init=/bin/bash.
