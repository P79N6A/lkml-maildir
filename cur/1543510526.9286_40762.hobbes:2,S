Your problem mentions a hang during fsck at bootup... this was how
I very first noticed my 2.2.X hangs, and the only way I was able to
reliably reproduce them (either booting with unclean filesystems and
dying during fsck, or booting normally, then ro remounting and fscking
my filesystems...)....  Could you dump me an extremely detailed list of
your hardware so I can compare with mine for similarities?
