Ok, pass me a brown paper bag labelled "Intel Inside".
The old messages didn't say anything at all.  I was hoping to solve the
problem in multiple steps (Intel first, other architectures later) but
it looks like I should either revert the messages or make them better
everywhere.
> Why not to replace 'make zImage' with 'make boot'?
Same reason that you don't like seeing 'make zImage' on your alpha after
you have been typing 'make boot' all these years.
People have expectations about what works and what doesn't.  The hard
part is writing documentation and messages that (a) works correctly
for everybody and (b) reflects what people have already been doing for
five years.
Michael
