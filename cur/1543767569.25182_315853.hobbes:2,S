Hmm... that puzzles me, although for no other reason than I'm not familiar 
with how Maxtor drives report themselves.  Having the BIOS-reported LBA 
sectors not equal to the OS-reported geometry may not be a problem, but 
I must defer to the experts on that one.  
As an FYI just in case, the new libata-based driver will treat your drives 
as SCSI drives, so you'll see the drives as sda, sdb, and so forth instead of
hd?.  
Good luck!
Drew
