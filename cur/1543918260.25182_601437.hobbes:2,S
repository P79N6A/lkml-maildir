Arjan,
I can experiment with any constraints if you suggest which one.
From our experiments with gcc, it compares asm strings (sic!!!) to find matches
to be merged! Sigh...
Below are 2 programs which differ in one space in read_cr3_b() asm statement.
The first one compiles incorrectly, while 2nd one - correctly.
My personal feeling is that comparing asm strings is simply a "misfeature".
-------------------------- cut ----------------------------
static inline unsigned long read_cr3_a(void)
{
        unsigned long cr3;
        asm("movq %%cr3,%0" : "=r" (cr3));
        return cr3;
}
static inline unsigned long read_cr3_b(void)
{
        unsigned long cr3;
        asm("movq %%cr3,%0" : "=r" (cr3));
        return cr3;
}
static inline void write_cr3(unsigned long val)
{
        asm volatile("movq %0,%%cr3" :: "r" (val) : "memory");
}
void main()
{
        unsigned long c;
        c = read_cr3_a();
        write_cr3(c | 0x80);
        c = read_cr3_b();
        write_cr3(c | 0x100);
}
