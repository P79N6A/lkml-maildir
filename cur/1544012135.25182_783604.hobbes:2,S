Subject: [PATCH 04/10] dlm: replace schedule with cond_resched
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/23/97

From: Steven Whitehouse <swhiteho@redhat.com>
This is a one-liner to use cond_resched() rather than schedule()
in the ast delivery loop. It should not be necessary to schedule
every time, so this will save some cpu time while continuing to
allow scheduling when required.
