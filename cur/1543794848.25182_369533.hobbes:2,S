I think you could get most of the benefit by just dropping
the volatile and "memory" from read_pda(). With that gcc would
usually CSE current into a register and it would would work essentially
the same way with only minor more .text overhead, but r10 would be still
available.
Unfortunately when that's done then the kernel doesn't boot.
It's probably something silly, but i never had time to track it down.
Might want to look into that?
Looking at your patch it might be enough to make sure all users
of current after the changes in __switch_to you did use some 
other way to access it (there is unfortunately no way I know
of to make gcc flush all CSEd items without addings barriers
in the original get_current function)
