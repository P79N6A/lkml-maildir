looks really nice to me. In particular i like the cleanup effect:
 5 files changed, 490 insertions(+), 744 deletions(-)
right now Thomas is merging hrtimer-latest to -rt, which temporarily 
blocks merging of intrusive patches - but i'll try to merge your patch 
after Thomas is done. (hopefully later today)
