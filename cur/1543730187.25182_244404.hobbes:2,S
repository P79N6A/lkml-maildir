They document .include but they also implement include.
BTW: For many years, the main problem with BSD make has been that it did not
implement pattern matching macro expansions (introduced ~ 1986 by Sun) correctly.
This year, I did fix this together with BSD people.
Unfortunately, later it turned out that BSD make handles path names to files
completely different from other make files.
