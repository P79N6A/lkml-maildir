I understand what you are trying to say but I don't believe "namespace" 
is the term you want to use since it is already used by the container 
folks for something completely different.

Yep, you can do that with NetLabel and the fallback/static labels like 
you've been doing.  Based on what I've seen from you so far, Secmark 
would also likely work for you but it takes a slightly different 
approach (configuration with iptables, different allow rules).

Yep, CIPSO is a labeling protocol like labeled IPsec.  Both have their 
advantages and disadvantages but both require that the other end of the 
connection support the labeling protocol.  Since you are talking about 
labeling public network traffic it is almost certain that the other end 
of your connections don't support a network labeling protocol.  The 
fallback/static labeling capabilities of NetLabel (that is 
the "unlabeled/unlbl" protocol in NetLabel, it is "unlabeled" because 
there is no label present on the network traffic) was designed to solve 
this case for the network peer label case.  Secmark was designed to 
solve this for the iptables label case.
If you don't understand the difference between a network peer label and 
a network iptables label here is the executive summary:
 "A network peer label represents the security attributes of the
  traffic's sender, a iptables label represents the network
  attributes of the traffic."
... which basically means the peer label tells you about the 
process/host which generated the data (SELinux context, Smack label, 
etc.) while the iptables label tells you about the network headers of 
the traffic (destination address, protocol, port, anything that 
iptables/netfilter can match on).

Hmm, can you show me the error?  I'd like to make sure it is fixed ...

I think so too :)

Ahhhh!  How did that happen?!  (see my response to your other email)
