The above means that you will still block on a F_GETLK query...
In any case, why would we want to return -EAGAIN in one case where
argp->block isn't set, and not in another? If there are cases where we
want to block and where we are not currently setting argp->block (the
only one I can think of might be NLMPROC_UNLOCK), then we should fix
the caller.
Cheers,
