sorry, I'm not in the lucky position that I get payed
for sending patches to LKML, so I have to think twice
before I invest time in coding up extra patches ...
i.e. you will have to live with my comments for now

well, Linux-VServer is "working", "secure", "flexible"
_and_ non-intrusive ... it is quite natural that less
won't work for me ... and regarding patches, there
will be a 2.2 release soon, with all the patches ...

yes, but there are certain drawbacks too, like:
 - performance of filesystem interfaces is quite bad
 - you need to do a lot to make the fs consistant for
   e.g. find and friends (regarding links and filesize)
 - you have a quite hard time to do atomic operations
   (except for the ioctl interface, which nobody likes)
 - vfs/mnt namespaces complicate the access to this
   new filesystem once you start moving around (between
   the spaces)
> Can you suggest any other extensible/flexible interface for these?
well, as you know, all current solutions use a syscall
interface to do most of the work, in the OpenVZ/Virtuozzo
case several, unassigned syscalls are used, while 
FreeVPS and Linux-VServer use a registered and versioned
(multiplexed) system call, which works quite fine for
all known purposes ...
I'm quite happy with the extensibility and flexibility
the versioned syscall interface has, the only thing I'd
change if I would redesign that interface is, that I
would add another pointer argument to eliminate 32/64bit
issues completely (i.e. use 4 args instead of the 3)
