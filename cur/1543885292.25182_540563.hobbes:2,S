Mmh, ok... My usage pattern for this is for an MUA plugin[1] that does
write 1 to /sys/class/leds/asus:mail/brightness, for example, when new
mail comes. The MUA typically runs as user and until now most of the
handled LEDs had no such permission problems
(/proc/acpi/asus/mled, /proc/acpi/acer/mailled etc). 
So, I've got to find a way to write into that file as user so that
things automatically work.

So, you suggest me to link my plugin to libpam and find something that
allows the plugin to write into /brightness? 
Thanks,
