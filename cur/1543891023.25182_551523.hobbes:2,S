This kind of interface doesn't make any sense at all.  Information should
be read and written from filedescriptors using the read and write family
syscalls and through the VFS instead of adding tons of system calls.
I fear we need to write down the requirements first and then come up
with something better.  E.g. for per-task sampling an interface centered
around a few files in /proc/<pid>/ would fit very nicely:
  /proc/<pid>/perfmon_pmcs
  /proc/<pid>/perfmon_pmds
  	Obvious
  /proc/<pid>/perfmon_ctl
  	Can get control commands as ascii sets written to
