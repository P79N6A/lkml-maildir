Subject: Kernel function documentation question
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

The Documentation/kernel-doc-nano-HOWTO.txt says that functions
should be documented as so:
/**
 * foobar() - short function description of foobar
I notice there are a number of places that ommit the () off the
foobar, for example:
include/linux/skbuff.h, line 461:
/**
 *	skb_get - reference buffer
 *	@skb: buffer to reference
where skb_get does not have ()s.
As a note, it seems the default debian emacs does not colour the
function name unless it ends ().
Also, is there any policy on tabs vs a single space for indenting
these comments?
