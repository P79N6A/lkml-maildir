If they differed at all, yes.

Even s390 is okay, isn't it?  MartinS's swp_type returns the highest
type, 31, corresponding to 32 types, as on every other architecture.
You and I and Martin Bligh would prefer this patch...
Remove unnecessary obfuscation from sys_swapon's range check on swap
type, which blew up causing memory corruption once swapless migration
made MAX_SWAPFILES no longer 2 ^ MAX_SWAPFILES_SHIFT.
