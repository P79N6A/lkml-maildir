Subject: [patch 4/5] x86_64: Dont use broadcast shortcut to make it cpu hotplug safe.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

[Andi doesn't like this simpler approach, and prefers to continue to use
 broadcast mode, with a more complex __cpu_up() to overcome the ill effects
 of broadcast. Hence based on his request the next patch (following this) 
 is provided to provide a run-time switch capability]
Broadcast IPI's provide un-expected behaviour for cpu hotplug. CPU's in offline
state also end up receiving the IPI. Once the cpus become online
they receive these stale IPI's which are bad and introduce unexpected
behaviour. 
This is easily avoided by not sending a broadcast and addressing just the 
CPU's in online map.  Doing prelim cycle counts it appears there is no big 
overhead and numbers seem around 0x3000-0x3900 on an average on x86 and x86_64 
systems with CPUS running 3G, both for broadcast and mask version of the API's. 
The shortcuts are useful only for flat mode (where the perf shows no 
degradation), and in cluster mode, its unicast anyway. Its simpler 
to just not use broadcast anymore.
