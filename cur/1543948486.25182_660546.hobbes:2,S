Subject: [PATCH] x86 vdso: fix build locale dependency
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/27/252

Priit Laes discovered that the sed command processing nm output was
sensitive to locale settings.  This was addressed in commit
03994f01e8b72b3d01fd3d09d1cc7c9f421a727c by using [:alnum:] in place of
[a-zA-Z0-9].  But that too is locale-dependent and may not always match
the identifiers it needs to.  The better fix is just to run sed et al
with a fixed locale setting in all builds.
