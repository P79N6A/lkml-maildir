Yes, I know this problem, but the triple fault didn't
work at all in my case, and I don't know why. The bios
doesn't branch to the pointer at 40:67. But as stated
before, the mail goal here is to try to catch a panic
in *most* situations; there always be some situations
in which it will not be possible. if some 486's can't
dump the message, that doesn't prevent them from
working perfectly the rest of the time.

Linus' comment says it doesn't work on some MB. I
believe at least on UMC480 or SiS461 chipsets it
doesn't work, but I don't remember well on what
MB I encountered problems a long time ago.
