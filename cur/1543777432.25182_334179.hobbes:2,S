Ingo,
This fixes the issue. It's one more 'crossed t' on the rt-preempt patches.
I'll let you know if I discover anything else; your work has already allowed 
us to bring the responsiveness of our instrument to 300us which is low enough 
for the real-time PCR industry. Thanks a lot!
This debugging process has been extremely eye opening, thanks for the detailed 
descriptions of what's gone wrong at every stage. I just wish I was competent 
enough to fix these things myself.
