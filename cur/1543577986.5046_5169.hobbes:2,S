Especially evil is a power failure, and then a second failure while fsck is
running...
So i hope Journaling FSs will have the power of normal FSs soon, so we can
have them as a default for consumers. Otherwise:
/dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target6/lun0/part1 on / type ext2 (ro)
proc on /proc type proc (rw)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw)
/dev/sda5 on /usr type ext2 (ro)
/dev/sda6 on /var type ext2 (r,noexec)
/dev/sda7 on /home type ext2 (rw,nosuid)
/dev/scd0 on /cdrom type iso9660 (ro)
some read only filesystems :)
Greetings
Bernd
