And (c) altering the setting during a core dump going to produce an
unusable core dump.  I don't think the locking is that difficult to add
and it just makes sense.  I would venture a guess that it will take less
time to actually do the locking than to continue arguing it is not needed
when it clearly appears it is needed for even a small number of cases.
