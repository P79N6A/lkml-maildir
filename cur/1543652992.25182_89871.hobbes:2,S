Hmm...If thousands of Red Hat and SuSE users worldwide can deal with a
scroll-down list with hundreds of components, I wonder why kernel
developers can't?
60+ items on an alphabetical, scroll-down list is very easy to handle.
Go to Red Hat or SuSE Bugzilla and try it and you'll see it's not bad
at all (and they have hundreds of items!).
Also, it seems that no one else is interested in this particular
stuff anyway, so let's talk.  I will call you on Monday.
