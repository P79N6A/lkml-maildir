	Well, couple things, for one, what about those 'more important
drivers'?  My biggest problem w/ linux these days is the scsi device
stuff.  If this could be fixed w/ shell scripts and reading info out
of /proc, then that may work.  But then, what about USB, PCMCIA, and
other dynamic pieces?  Do you have modprobe or whatnot create and
delete the nodes?  Do you just create the nodes w/ the assumption that
they'll be used?
		Just some thoughts.
