So do you have a general guideline as to when you'd like patches sent
to you for the next merge window?  The releases are fairly
predictable, so perhaps something like one of the later -rc candidates
for the upcoming release?
E.g. patches for 2.6.24 should be to you by 2.6.23-rc<N>?
Of course, this is assuming they go through you.  I'm not trying to
complicate things.  Just trying to get an understanding of how you'd
like it to work.
