Sorry, this isn't making sense.  Are you implying that you want to use
DMA to copy data from user to kernel space?  Or something else?
In any case, I do hope that you are aware that copy_to_user/copy_from_user
have rather important side effects other than just copying data?  They
cause page faults which ensure that the user space pages are paged in
and/or copied if written to as appropriate.
In another post, you mention that this patch was not provided for review.
However, it _is_ effectively provided for review because it's an
illustration of _how_ the interfaces are used - and we're reviewing
the interfaces provided by the SPI core.
