We actually have a working prototype version of a filesystem that can do
copy-on-write, among other things.  The filesystem (OBDFS) is part of
the Lustre project (see www.lustre.org for more details), and it uses
a file-centric rather than block centric approach to managing storage.
Since there is a clean abstraction between the VFS interface and the
on-disk storage, it was relatively straight forward to add a "snapshot"
layer which will do COW, and we can have dated snapshots that can be
mounted as read-only filesystems, or restored to the current read-write
filesystem
The filesystem is based on ext2, and it is currently functional, but
definitely not production quality, and doesn't have a working e2fsck
when using snapshots.  We have been developing with 2.3.34, but the code
may work with later kernels.  You can download the latest tarball to
get a working version, or anonymous CVS for the bleeding-edge code at
www.lustre.org.

The OBDFS snapshots we have developed work on a per-inode basis (rather
than a per-block COW).  What is really interesting about OBDFS is that
the VFS/disk separation allows all kind of "functional layers" to be
added, snapshots are only one of them.  Other possibilities include
mirroring/RAID, encryption, RPC (remote disks/NAS), etc.
