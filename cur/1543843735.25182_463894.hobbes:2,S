So now you're resorting to your uber-talents as a kernel guru to bury
the other side? This attitude, if you permit, I find cowardly and
hypocritical. It renders a huge disservice to kernel developers at
large by making it clear to outside observers that if they do not
curry the favors of key kernel developers or submit material which is
consensual to a given line of thought then they are not welcome.
Keep on at it. The writing is on the wall for those kernel developers
who genuinely wish that outside contributors make an effort in
pushing stuff back into mainline. Keep on at it Ingo. Hack this one
to death. I know of very few people who have your clout or
understanding of the kernel intricacies to match you in such an
arms race.
Go Ingo, Go.
