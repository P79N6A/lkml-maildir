A lot of it can be tidied up by very very few changes that can be done
over time and make the job easier. Why not just start with
	dev_printk(dev, KERN_ERR "Exploded mysteriously");
and a few notification type things people can add eg
	dev_failed(dev);
	dev_offline(dev);
much like we keep network status. That lets driverfs tell the decision
making code in hotplug scripts the state of play and lets it figure out
how to reassign resources, paper over cracks, phone the engineer.
