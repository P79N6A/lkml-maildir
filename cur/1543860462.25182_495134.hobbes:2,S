Can we please not have N different interfaces to the open-firmware
calls so that perhaps powerpc and Sparc have a chance of using this
code too?
On sparc and powerpc, we even build an in-kernel data structure of the
entire open-firmware device tree that code like your's could use if
you make a simple setup layer for i386 as well.  We have interfaces for
modifying property values at run time too.
I would strongly suggest looking at things like
arch/{sparc,sparc64,powerpc}/kernel/prom.c and
include/asm-{sparc,sparc64,powerpc}/prom.h and
arch/{sparc,sparc64,powerpc}/kernel/of_device.c and
include/asm-{sparc,sparc64,powerpc}/of_device.h
since we've already invested a lot of thought and
infrastructure into providing interfaces to this information
on powerpc and the two sparc platforms.
Thanks.
