Please repeat after me:
 "THE  FS  DOES  NOT  SEE  THE  MMU  ACCESSED  BITS"
Also, if a piece of data is in the page cache, it is accessed
without calling the filesystem code.
This means the filesystem doesn't know how often pages are or
are not used, hence it cannot make the decisions the VM make.
Or do you want to have your own ReiserVM and ReiserPageCache ?
regards,
Rik
