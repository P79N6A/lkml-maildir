Not 100% success but at least something ;). I did some research on this some 
time ago (2005):
http://lists.lm-sensors.org/pipermail/lm-sensors/2005-October/014050.html
I'm attaching my dsdt.bin. Also keep in mind that we will need some 
"synchronizer" for the ACPI versus other drivers.
Thanks,
Rudolf
