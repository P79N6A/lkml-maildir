I use Kubuntu's own kernel build via the command "make-kpkg 
--revision=1  kernel_image kernel_headers". It fails at the very early 
build stage. When issued this command, just after few lines and then it 
fails. Today, I will try the same .config with recently released rc5 and 
will let know the result.
