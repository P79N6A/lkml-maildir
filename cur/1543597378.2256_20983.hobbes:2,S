Yes; it did some IO, but most of its time was doing CPU work
(it was CPU bound)

It was a normal Intel SMP box with no special settings and the interrupts
should have been evenly distributed (I did not check it at this time, but
normally they are about evenly distributed over the two cpus)

I'm not sure about the Mac, but on x86 linux boxes the SMP bootup synchronizes
the time stamp counters of the CPUs. If they are synchronized on your box
also you could store TSC value in the IPI sender and compute the average
latency in the receiver.
