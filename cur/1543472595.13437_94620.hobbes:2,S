Subject: Unable to compile 2.1.131 *without* SMP

I am unable to compile 2.1.131 without SMP. I was able to do it when I was
running Slackware 3.5, but since I've switched to Debian 2.0r3, I can't.
I've tried with gcc 2.7.2.3 and gcc 2.8.1.
If someone could help me with this, I'd really appreciate it.
