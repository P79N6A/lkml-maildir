You mean you want to:
- move the code from the header file to a .c file
- implement the write method that is currently empty
- add uses of the eeprom code (note that even ns83820.c used only
  one of the 7 functions in eeprom.h).
Noone did any of these during the more than 3 years eeprom.h already 
exists...
