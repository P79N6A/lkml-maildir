that's a bigger cost during context switch but it's still zero cost for
the syscalls, and it never flushes away the user address space
unnecessairly. So I doubt it's measurable (unlike 4:4 which is a big hit).

it is indeed tricky, though your last patch for 3.5G on PAE looked fine.
But now I would like to include the 2.5:1.5 not 3.5:0.5 ;), maybe we can
support 3.5:0.5 too at the same time (though 3.5:0.5 is secondary).

would you be willing to implement config 15GB too (2.5:1.5)? In the next
days I'm going to work on the rbtree for the objrmap (just in case
somebody wants to swap the shm with vlm instead of mlocking it), but I
would like to get this done too ;).
you see my current tree in 2.6.5-rc1-aa1 on the ftp site, but you can
use any other kernel too since the code you will touch should be the
same for all 2.6.
It's up to you, only if you are interested, thanks.
