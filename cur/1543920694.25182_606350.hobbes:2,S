Could somebody please document WTF writepage() is supposed to do, and
WTF page_mkwrite() is for?
I thought that page_mkwrite() was supposed to finally allow us to deal
with dirty pages in a clean manner: the caller gets to tell the
filesystem that it wants the entire page written out, and then dirties
the page. What is the point if the VM then expects to be able to
circumvent this?
