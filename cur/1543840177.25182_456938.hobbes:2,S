	Then I think it belongs in a separate patch. Add it and the scattered
bits and pieces that use it with the same patch. Then folks can clearly
see what it's for, where it impacts the code, and how it works. Yes,
factoring it out causes the API to evolve over the course of applying
the patch series -- IMHO that evolution is useful information to convey
to reviewers too.
