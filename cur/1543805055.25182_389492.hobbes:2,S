Partially incorrect.  With or without the patch, "H" will indicate an
overrun.
If someone sent me "ABCDEFGHI(...long delay...)J", all before I could
read "ABCDEFGH", NUL with TTY_OVERRUN, then "IJ".  With the patch, I
will read "ABCDEFGH", NUL with TTY_OVERRUN, then "J".
I do not want to read "I" after long delay.  Dropping the "I" is not a
problem while I can know that an overrun happened there.

I suppose typical 8250 will drop "I".  The TXX9 UART does not (it is
described in the datasheet.  Not a bug).
I have been using uart_insert_char() and it helps me to pass NUL (with
TTY_OVERRUN) after "H" char.  But the it is not enough to handle this
queer behavior.
