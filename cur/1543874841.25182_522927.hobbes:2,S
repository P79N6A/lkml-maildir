Yeah, we heard, people want to name their network interfaces "irq". :)

There will be a directory at the bus-device with the name of the
class, that glues together the bus-devices and the class-devices in
the unified tree:
  
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/gregkh/patches.git;a=blob;f=driver/driver-core-fix-namespace-issue-with-devices-assigned-to-classes.patch;hb=HEAD
So the network-interface(s) will be in their own directory "net",
below the bus-device, and don't conflict with the existing attributes.
Thanks,
Kay
