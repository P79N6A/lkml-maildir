So...if i understand what you are saying (which i'm not sure i do) there is 
a setting needed when configuring the kernel before compilng (make xconfig 
in my case) that says "version info"?  I did look at my settings again... 
and nothing jumped out and bit me in the face.  Did i miss something?  Which 
area or topic of the configuration should i look for this version info 
setting?
did anything i just said make any sense? :)
