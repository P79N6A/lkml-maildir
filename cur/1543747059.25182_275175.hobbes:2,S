Well, we want things to be split. However a split doesn't mean a
reorganisation as far as userspace visibility is concerned; the filenames
can still be the same, and the typenames etc etc, you just do the kernel
internal additions in a different dir/header
Not breaking userland ever is a dream only, anytime we touch any header,
some userland breaks (they use our spinlock code even!)

nope.
Fedora has it's own set of cleaned up headers. Cleaned up in the sense that
tehre's no #ifdef KERNEL anymore, no inlines (because that's a license trap,
and in addition, all inlines were kernel specific anyway) and all structs
which had spinlocks / semaphores and other kernel private structures in are
removed as well (because they are clearly kernel internal).
