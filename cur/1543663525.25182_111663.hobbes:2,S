The best and reliable way to go is by the output of CPUID
(or cat /proc/cpuinfo)
if (((family == 6)  && (model >= 6)) || (family == 15)) {
    printk(KERN_INFO "Advanced speculative caching feature present\n");
    return 1;
}
If your AMD processor meets the above CPUID family and model, then
you need the patch. The decoder ring from any random
Product name to CPUID family and model number is not yet available ;-)
