Actually, the analysis turned out to be not entirely
correct.  I think I have identified the offending
code.  Please see attached patch.  It makes kswapd()
skip zones which contain greater than "pages_high"
pages.
Machine setup is the same as before.
2x2.0Ghz Xeon w/HT, memory 256M (manually pegged).
I see this lopsided lower zone scanning on a dual
Opteron machine as well.
Attached are the kernbench results for stock 2.6.8-rc1
and 2.6.8-rc1 with patch.
Thanks,
Shantanu
