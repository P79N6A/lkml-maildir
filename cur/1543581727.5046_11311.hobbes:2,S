Hi,
I amtyping this without correcting -- allthe lost characters you see
(including spaces!) are exactly what the pseudo-tty driver does! This is
2.4.1 a it definitely (oh, see "nd" of the ave "and" disappeared? and
"above" turned into "ave"!) did work fine previously -- like in the days
of 2.3.99 and 2.4.0-teX series (yes, teX was meant to be "testX"!)
So, the keyboard or pty driver is badly broken.
Regards,
Tigran
PS. This only happens on this Dell latitude CPx (notice lost shift in
Latitude?) H450GT. 
PPS. No, my laptop is fine -- rebootingnto 2.2.x makes it type without
loosing characters...
