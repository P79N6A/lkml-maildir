Hmm, one could thake the zfs as a blurb and write a GPL'ed adapter (as
external patch) to the Kernel (similar to the nvidia ones and their
binary blurb drivers). The ZFS blurb would count as "not derived" since
it is IMHO exactly that.
And now I don't know if it makes sense, could actually work or how much
work it is. Experienced VFS people may have a opinion on this.
