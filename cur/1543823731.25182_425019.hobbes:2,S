It's a generic concern and I honestly don't know how significant it is which 
is why I'm asking if it needs attention. That concern being that any time 
we're under any sort of memory pressure, ZONE_DMA will undergo intense 
reclaim even though there may not really be anything specifically going on in 
ZONE_DMA. It just seems a waste of cycles doing that.
