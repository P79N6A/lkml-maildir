How difficult would it be to extend the OOM grim-reaper to allow a
user configuration file, perhaps with specifiable kill-first processes
and kill-last processes?  For example, one poster had stated that some
users might prefer that their httpd processes were given the greatest
tolerance, or another that his math crunching program be the omega.
Either (or both) could be specified through a configuration file that
allowed regular expression parsing, or parsing similar to the
hosts.allow file.
