Subject: [PATCH] Fix messed hunks in generic_setlease
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/25/57

I have noticed, that one hunk was lost and one duplicated 
during merging the fix-potential-oops-in-generic_setlease(-xxx) 
patches. One of the fixes is already in the hot-fixes, but the
second one is still lost.
The returned pointer was not the one allocated, but some temporary
used to scan through the inode's locks list. This caused and OOPS 
during Kamalesh's testing.
