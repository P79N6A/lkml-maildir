Find by me if folks have their dirty laundry.  There are limits to my
powers to set things right.
Sorry to have provoked your length explanation of physical_balance, but
in the version of the kernel that I happened to do my research on,
2.6.3-rc1-mm1, this is _dead_ code.  The variable physical_balance is
never read, just written, and only appears on 3 lines total.
Obviously if it is in use in current versions of the kernel, then it's
not dead code anymore (at least not without a more profound
understanding of what's going on, which I make no claims to).
