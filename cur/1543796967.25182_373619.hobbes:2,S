Of the DSDTs I've looked at, most seem to provide taskfile commands 
concerned about doing things like setting up drive security. I haven't 
yet seen an IDE failure on resume when using this patch, so the _GTF 
stuff doesn't seem terribly important. The reason for it not currently 
being implemented is that the IDE queues haven't been restarted at the 
point where this code is called, so there's no obvious way of submitting 
them to the drive yet.
