While the fact that Windows uses a PS/2 driver suggests that it's not 
serial, tablet devices are often connected to a UART at a non-legacy 
address. cat /sys/bus/pnp/*/id should give you a list of IDs, one of 
which may look quite obviously different to the others - Wacom devices 
tend to be WAC0004 or something, for instance. If there is one, try 
sticking it in the table in drivers/serial/8250_pnp.c and see if that 
results in a new serial device showing up.
