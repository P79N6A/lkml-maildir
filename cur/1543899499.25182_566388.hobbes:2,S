OK, this patch is *ugly*.  Not that there's anything wrong with a patch
which says "I'm going to preempt you", but making it kvm-specific is
ugly.  ISTR times past where I wanted such a hook, although none spring
immediately into my pre-coffee brain.
I think a "struct preempt_ops *" and a "void *preempt_ops_data" inside
every task struct is a better idea.  Call the config option
PREEMPT_SCHED_HOOKS and now there's nothing kvm-specific about it...
Cheers,
Rusty.
