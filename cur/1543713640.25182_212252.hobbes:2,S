I've just found the time to do a quick test under 2.6.3 with the same
test.  Running
  > badblocks -wsv /dev/hdg
and then doing a

			       HighPoint HPT366/368/370/372/374
  Controller: 0
  Chipset: HPT302
  --------------- Primary Channel --------------- Secondary Channel ----------
  Enabled:        yes                             yes
  Cable:          ATA-66                          ATA-66
  --------------- drive0 --------- drive1 ------- drive0 ---------- drive1 ---
  DMA capable:    yes              no             yes               no
  Mode:           UDMA             off            UDMA              off
Immediately causes the following error to appear in the logs, and all
access to /dev/hdg hangs, only a reboot will clear it up.

I haven't had a chance to move the disk from secondary channel to be
the slave on the primary.  I'm kinda scared to lose all my data on the
still living half of my disk. 
Is there any more information I can provide here?
