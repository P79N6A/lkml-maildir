The mistake in the above paragraph is its use of the term "the hotplug
lock".
Think.  We don't want to lock CPUs.  We don't want to block plug/unplug
events.
What we _do_ want is for subsystems to be able to guarantee the stability
of their per-cpu data and the coherency of that data with cpu_online_map
and cpu_present_map.
We should delete lock_cpu_hotplug() and start again.  Perhaps we can do
that post-2.6.18 if we can cobble the current stuff into some semi-working
state.  But I doubt if it's very important really - we have heaps of code
in there which is already racy wrt hotplug and adding a little more isn't
likely to hurt.
I count 187 instances of for_each_online_cpu(), and most of them are racy. 
There's just no way we can fix all these with lock_cpu_hotplug().  It
simply doesn't have a future.
