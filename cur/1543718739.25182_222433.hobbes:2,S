It's strange that you appear to be using poll_idle().  Maybe it's an error
in the profiler - it sometimes makes mistakes in identifying small
functions.
But if you _are_ using poll_idle() and if your CPU is hyperthreaded then
yes, one "CPU" is going to take a performance hit from the "idle" one.
Is your CPU hyperthreaded?  (cat /proc/cpuinfo)
Are you booting with "idle=poll"?  Do `dmesg -s 1000000 | grep idle'.
