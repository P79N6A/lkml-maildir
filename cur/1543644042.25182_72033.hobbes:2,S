yes, i too think it's correct. In fact this is partly proven by one piece
of code in the old tty_io.c file:
void disassociate_ctty(int on_exit)
[...]
        read_lock(&tasklist_lock);
        for_each_process(p)
                if (p->session == current->session)
                        p->tty = NULL;
        read_unlock(&tasklist_lock);
ie. if the SID-based iteration is incorrect, then the above code is 
incorrect already - but we never saw any problems in this area.
