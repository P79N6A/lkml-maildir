Your interface has compatible calling conventions between 32 and 64
bit user programs, so for x86, all you need to do is to add them to
arch/x86/ia32/ia32entry.S in the same way as you did for
arch/x86/kernel/syscall_table_32.S.
For the other architectures, the respective maintainers will take
care of this if your patch gets accepted. Unfortunately, each
architecture has a different way of adding the compat system
calls.
