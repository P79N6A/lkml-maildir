No.
I did:
make menuconfig - change from i686 to pentiumm - save settings.
make 
make install
mkinitrd -s 1024x768 -k "bzImage.2.6.8-24.5-default" -I "initrd" -m
"reiserfs"
lilo
If I "mount -o loop" the new initrd, modinfo shows the type of
reiserfs.ko to be "PENTIUMM" as I would expect...
I have also tried compiling reiserfs support directly into the kernel
and dropping reiserfs from the -m option, to no avail.
