And I mentioned exactly this. It's my third alternative.
And it doesn't work well, exactly because developers don't know if the 
libraries they use are always single-threaded etc. More importantly, it 
just doesn't happen that much. People do "make ; make install". Hopefully 
from pretty standard sources. Having to tweak things so that a project 
compiles with a magic flag on a particular distribution is simply not done 
very much.
