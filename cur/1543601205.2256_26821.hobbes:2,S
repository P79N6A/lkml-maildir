Mounting read-only and then syncing might do it.  Going directly to
the block device on 2.4.x is not supported when the filesystem is
mounted.  This is because the page cache is not coherent with the
block cache, and there are now plans to make this the case.   In
general this won't work anyway because some other program might 
be modifying your fs while you read the block device.
