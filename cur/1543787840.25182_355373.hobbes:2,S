I'm not surprised.  CMD2 is part way through the initialisation
sequence, so no one should be sending a CMD7.
After a CMD2, the next expected command is a CMD3 for MMC cards (maybe
not SD cards).
Given the code, I don't see how you can possibly be sending a CMD7
before the initialisation has completed.  You need to find out why
a CMD7 is being sent after CMD2.

This is not a fix.
