Subject: Small bug in menuconfig (tested on 2.3.2)

		Hello,
	New subject for having fun in 'make menuconfig':
1. Go to the sound section
2. Press Y on "Sound card support"
3. Press Y on "OSS sound modules"
4. Press Y on "Persistent DMA buffers"
5. Go up to "Sound card support" and press M
Voila! DMA buffers does not disappear. AFAIK if I compile sound support as module I had to pass a 
'dmabuf=1' in the parameters line. What about this ?
