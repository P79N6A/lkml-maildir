Right. That shouldn't happen. Since an object is usally tied to exactly
one plugin this can't happen I think. At least as long the programmer
doesn't mess anything up.

I think that's what Hans is trying to suggest. The core is theoretically
usable for anything. He made a filesystem of it.
You can see reiser4 as a library and the UNIX directory and file plugins
as the filesystem. That's why they are linked in uncoditionally because
it doesn't make sense otherwise. It's mainly the naming that seems to
confuse people.
