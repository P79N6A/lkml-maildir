Sorry for replying to Alan's reply, I missed the original mail.

(a && ~a) & (b & 32)
I don't think that does what you think it does, because at that point
it's a funny way to write 0 ((0 or 1) binary-and (0 or 32)).
I'm not even sure what it is you want.  If for the first part you
wanted (id[76] != 0x00 && id[76] != 0xff), please write just that,
thanks :-)
  OG.
