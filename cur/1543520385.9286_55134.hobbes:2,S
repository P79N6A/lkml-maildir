I just chose the simplest change. Your version is more logical. If it doesn't
affect performance it makes little difference.

The test here is just asking if there has been any wraparound in the
calculations. It's similar to what is happening in the first patch _but_ here
offset is a parameter not a calculated value so it is much harder to for the
function to know what to do. Either you have to check all this function's
callers to see if offset is properly calculated or you make this test work and
see if anything happens. I think the second way is much easier. :-)
