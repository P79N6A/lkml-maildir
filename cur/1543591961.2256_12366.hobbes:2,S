Perhaps it's none of my business, but it doesn't seem very sporting to
just turn something on that breaks stuff and say "you had fair
warning".  Why not shut it back off, issue a statement saying it works
now and will be re-enabled on June 10th or something, and everyone must
do thus and so or they will break on that day?
Vague things like "it'll be turned on real soon now" or ASAP really mean
"never" since admins always have things with real deadlines at the top
of their list.
