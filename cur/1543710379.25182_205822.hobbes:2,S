MCE == hardware error.
In this case un-recoverable.
I'll take a swing at decoding this, call the Coast Guard if I don't
return in 30 minutes;-)

fig 14-4 says this means that indeed, you have a valid MCE.

fig 14-6 says:
63: valid register contents
61: UC -- processor did not correct the error
57: PCC -- Processor context corrupt (you're dead)
0400 is the MCA error code
fig E2 says
10 - internal watchdog timeout.
26,27 -- TT -- Thread timeout indicator -- both threads timed out

I have no idea what causes this error, but it sure sounds specific to
the processor, and specific to HT -- which matches your experiments. 
I'd imagine that after you verify that you've got the latest BIOS for
the board and the error persists that you should look into getting that
specific processor replaced.
