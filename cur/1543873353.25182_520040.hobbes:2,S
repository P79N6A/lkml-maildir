There are none.
Symlinks embedded in the source tree tend to be hard to maintain: you can 
traditionally not send patches to add/change/move/remove them, and not 
everybody can even import them at all (ie some people have been so damaged 
by CVS that they maintain their kernels in it - I'm trying my best to be a 
humanitarian and rid the world of the scourge that is CVS, but I'm not 
sure I can undo the untold mental damage wrought by it over decades of 
quiet suffering).
With git, you can track symlinks and send them as patches, but we've not 
really had a huge reason to do so. They are easy enough to generate from 
Makefiles if required, and quite often you don't really need to anyway (ie 
the "symlink" is often just a make rule, like the 
	SRCDIR := ../../../i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq
line I quoted earlier).
So I'd rather not even start using symlinks unless there is some really 
good reason. We can continue to just use Makefiles.
