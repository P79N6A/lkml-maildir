  Hi, all. Version 192 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
Patch directly available from:
ftp://ftp
.??.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rgooch/v2.4/devfs-patch-current.gz
AND:
ftp://ftp.atnf.csiro.au/pub/people/rgooch/linux/kernel-patches/v2.4/devfs-patch-current.gz
REMINDER: this patch and earlier patches include support for >2000
SCSI discs.
This is against 2.4.10-pre11. Highlights of this release:
- Removed unnecessary #ifdef CONFIG_DEVFS_FS from arch/i386/kernel/mtrr.c
- Created sdmalloc() and sdfree() macros in drivers/scsi/sd.c
- Ported to kernel 2.4.10-pre11
- Set inode->i_mapping->a_ops for block nodes in <get_vfs_inode>
				Regards,
					Richard....
