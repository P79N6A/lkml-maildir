Subject: [PATCH] dlm: match signedness between dlm_config_info and cluster_set
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/13/702

cluster_set is only called from the macro CLUSTER_ATTR which defines read/write
access functions.  Make the signedness match to avoid sparse warnings every time
CLUSTER_ATTR is used (lines 149-159) all of the form:
fs/dlm/config.c:149:1: warning: incorrect type in argument 3 (different signedness)
fs/dlm/config.c:149:1:    expected unsigned int *info_field
fs/dlm/config.c:149:1:    got int extern [toplevel] *<noident>
