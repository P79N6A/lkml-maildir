Nope; do it in the platform code or a cdm driver.  Otherwise there is
no protection against collisions on the cdm registers.  The driver
could call a platform hook to fiddle with clocking, but it must not
touch it directly.
(BTW, I don't intended to push this version of the patch; I just want
to get everyone's brain juices flowing to figure out the best way to
solve it.)
