hi,
i am using linux-2.6.0 on my laptop and it work's fine ;)
so i still like to enable some features of the kernel: module unloading
  i enabled (menuconfig->Loadable module support->Module unloading&Forced
module unloading)
  after booting up the kernel it asked me to report a bug in module.c, but
i cannot find the message in my running system (i am not a experienced
bug reporter ;)
i'd like to provide you information but i do not know how to dump my
screen or find a logfile where this text is saved.
please tell me what i can tell you so i could help you and you will help me
thanx
joerg
