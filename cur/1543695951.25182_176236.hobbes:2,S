Certainly can, I'm not sure how well, the information I have here seems 
to suggest that you need to use a serial console (there's no framebuffer 
support), but otherwise, the SGI O2 will certainly run Linux.
Some useful links:
	
http://www.debian.org/ports/mips/
		- Debian MIPS{,-el} port
	
http://dev.gentoo.org/~kumba/mips/mips.html
		- Gentoo for MIPS
These are mainly orientated at the Indy, especially the latter one, 
however there is some information on the O2.
