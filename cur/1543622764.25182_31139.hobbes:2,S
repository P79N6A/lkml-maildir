ease of finding the bug :). 'cause this would leave tw in the list withought
deleting it.. that would blow tw_bind_bucket_cache pool and that is so much
easier to find. would've been fixed in very early days.. probably in 2.3.0.1
:->. Still not argueing for double refcount. Reversing the removal order
would work too.. now we will have "if (!tw->tb) return;" instead.

I didn't think you would want to avoid multiple calls to tw_kill() either.
