PT_NOTE segments are not generally mmaped directly, nor are they
generally very large.  There should be no problem for a note-using
program to load/copy the notes into memory with appropriate alignment. 
I guess a lot of the contents of core elf notes are register dumps and
so on, so debuggers must be already dealing with this.
