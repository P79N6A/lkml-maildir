Hi Matthew,
I have a few comments and a question on this patch, please.
(Yes, I know it won't be merged.)
Most of these are general patch process comments.
However, the last comment is the important one.
1.  I had problems applying it.  What tree is it against?
    Say so in the description.
2.  use diff -p (in SubmittingPatches)
3.  use diffstat
4.  Why 2 diffs against include/linux/libata.h ?
    I was hoping that diffstat would show this, but it just merges
    the 2 libata.h patches together.  'lsdiff' does show this,
    however.
5.  #includes in alpha order as much as possible.
6.  Patch had some trailing whitespace (usually tabs).
    Some tools detect this and warn about it.
7.  Most important:  What good does the ACPI interface do/add?
    What I mean is that acpi_get_child() in scsi_acpi_find_channel()
    always returns a handle value of 0, so it doesn't get us
    any closer to determining the ACPI address (_ADR) of the SATA
    devices.  The acpi_get_devices() technique in my patch (basically
    walking the ACPI namespace, looking at all "devices") is the
    only way that I know of doing this, but I would certainly
    like to find a better way.
