Because I happen to have an existing interface right at hand with all those
pretty things on it.  'ip' is extremely like Cisco's ip command which is
heavily spread across the world.  Commonality :)

I like it when it does it automatically, just like I plug my monitor and all
other devices into a single power center so when I turn on the purty box, I
turn on all the devices. =)
The route is an integral part of the address specification.  The two are
paired and altho I was strongly against this in the beginning, I learned how
to do networking correctly and have not found any reason at all for having
to delete the automatic stuff.
