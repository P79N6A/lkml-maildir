It should be portable, but it still isn't as efficient as just dumping the

I think I see what you're trying to do now, so just ignore this part =)

The most portable and easiest way to achieve this behaviour right now is
to use individual files or shm segments for the shared mappings.  Using
SysV shared memory will get you the most performance since it won't get
written back to disk early (like mmaped files).  If that doesn't give you
enough space, I strongly recommend using 1 file per shared "segment",
since the semantics you get by truncating and then extending the mapping
are exactly what you want.  As a bonus, this technique works on
filesystems that don't support files with holes =)
