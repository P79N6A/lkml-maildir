No.
It's very simple:
1) memory becomes full
2) we try to free memory by paging or swapping
3) I/O requires a memory allocation which fails because memory is full
4) box dies because it's unable to dig itself out of OOM
Most I/O paths can deal with this by having a mempool for their I/O
needs. For network I/O, this turns out to be prohibitively hard due to
the complexity of the stack.
