I tried to configure 2.4.17pre2 with mconfig 0.20, it said:
| drivers/block/paride/Config.in: 32: warning: bool command has extra
| arguments
And rightly so, bool wants the configuration question and the parameter,
nothing else.
Either that needs some dep_ stuff or it has indeed an extra argument, I
cannot decide which one is correct, so I'm not providing a patch now.
Would it be possible to fix this before 2.4.17 or 2.5.1 respectively?
