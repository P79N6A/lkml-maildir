It shouldn't much matter for the simple reason that the only thing you can
do with the return value from ioremap() is to pass it in to read[bwl]()
and friends, and they (for historical reasons) accept both a pointer and a
integer.
So you might as well toss a coin - it has to be something you can do
arithmetic on because I want people to be able to just say "base+offset",
but again "unsigned long" and "void *" are equivalent on gcc in that
regard. If it wasn't for the arithmetic issue I'd just make it a special
type altogether to make the compiler warn about misuses.
For _true_ cleanliness, it should probably be something like
	typedef struct {
		unsigned long base;
	} io_base_t;
	/*
	 * The ISA legacy region 640kB-1M is always mapped, 
	 * here's the base
	 */
	extern io_base_t isa_io_base;
	extern io_base_t ioremap(unsigned long addr, unsigned long len);
	extern unsigned char readb(io_base_t base, unsigned int offset);
	...
but while I'd potentially like to see that I also wonder about just the
pain of doing the conversion.
