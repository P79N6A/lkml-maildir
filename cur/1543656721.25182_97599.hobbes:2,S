There is also a link to it on the query page - the Components label. 
Basically its a link to
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/describecomponents.cgi
We could put a link to it on the main page or elsewhere too if that
would be more convenient.  It would be easy enough to write a page to
show all the component owners in one shot too if desired.
