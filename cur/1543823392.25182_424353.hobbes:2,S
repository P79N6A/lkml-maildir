The only reason was a failed LTP testcase which fills up the FD table 
and then called exec.

The flat loader does not need a FD value.

I think it is relevant: if the spec does not require it, and the flat 
loader does not need the FD, then there is no reason to return EMFILE. 
Both conditions are true in this case.  If the spec did require it, then 
that would be an argument that the LTP testcase is valid, and for 
keeping the original patch.
