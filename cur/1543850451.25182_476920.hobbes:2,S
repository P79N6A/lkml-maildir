Simple: you don't. There are a bunch of problems over here:
1) The system() call is a userland libc call and doesn't exist in the
   kernel
2) You can't be sure you're in user context
3) You don't know in what filesytem namespace you are
You could use call_usermodehelper() if you really need to call a
usermode helper, but usually it's a sign of bad design if you need to.
