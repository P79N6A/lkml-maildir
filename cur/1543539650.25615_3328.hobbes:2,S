Actually, the situation is more like that you have a covered fusebox in
your house, but you don't have a lock on it. Yes, you can unscrew the
cover and get yourself screwed (write a program that uses the ioctl and
kills the drive), and no lock is protecting you from fiddling with the
wires, but you can't get killed by just simply touching the thing when
walking through your house in the dark.
This amount of protection (I don't say security, this can't ever be
secure) seems to be fine for most households.
Normal programs won't ever have the chance to do anything bad using the
ioctl. They don't use it. They don't even have /dev/hda open.
By the way, the ioctl exists since 2.0 days, very likely since 1.0 even.
Has *anyone* killed their drive by accident this way?
Seems like the current protection against accidental damage is ok.
Against intentional damage only disabling all raw io access can help.

The kernel validates the parameters. The inode, the ioctl number, the
pointer to the structure, and then passes the data to the drive. It
doesn't validate the data. It cannot reliably - either it'll filter too
much or too little, but never get it right with not all of the commands
being known.

This is a good point. But in that case, the right solution would be just
to simply remove this raw hd io ioctl and replace it with hardware
abstracted (best independent on IDE/ATAPI) get/set info/options and
read/write firmware commands to the kernel via some interface, be it
another ioctl or /proc tree or /dev node.
That'd be ok. That's hardware abstraction. That's what a kernel is
supposed to do. But not filtering data provided by userland, that's
policy and doesn't belong to the kernel. The difference is subtle, but
still is there.
