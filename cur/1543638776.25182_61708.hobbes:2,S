Andre - you are assuming the drive vendor follows 8038i and didnt just
leave the reserved bits random. At that point 0x76 makes reasonable
sense since its two DMA capable devices + a reserved bit and interrupt
with bus master error. 
Which simply means the code is still broken rather than anything truely
insane is happening.
