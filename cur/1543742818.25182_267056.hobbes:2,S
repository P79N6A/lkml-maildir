I would say "md", but I am biased.

Forwards.
It is unlikely that support for useful functionality will go away.
I would prefer to see all arrays being assembled by an initrd-like
thing (initramfs??) but wouldn't dream of encouraging that until it
was easy to use and widely used.  We aren't there yet.

It is unlikely that md will be replaced by dm in the foreseeable
future.
It is possible that dm will increase in functionality and become very
widely used.

While I know no details of DM, I doubt there is substantial difference
here.  It isn't a hard problem.

That sounds very unfortunate.  Without knowing the details it is hard
to comment on why this might have happened and how it could have been
avoided, but with modern tools (mdadm) and a sufficiently modern
kernel (2.4 at least) this should never be able to happen (without
deliberate carelessness on the part of the sysadmin).

Many believe that that would not be a win.  Personally I share that
view.  HW-Raid-Controllers are not "open".  md (and dm) SW-Raid is.
Good Luck.
