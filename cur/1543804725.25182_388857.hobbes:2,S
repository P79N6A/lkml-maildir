It's been off in Fedora since FC4.
RHEL4 had it enabled after several vendors complained a lot about its
absense breaking an installed userbase, though they were told it would be
enabled with the proviso that it would go away in the future.
RHEL5 isn't even in beta yet, but I can already hear the voices asking
for it be reenabled..
