That's really nothing! An idle disk is reading the same sectors over
and over and over again. Neither reading nor writing wears them out.
Magnetizing magnetic domains is not a wearout mechanism, neither is
reading. The energy extracted during the read comes from the spin-motor.
The disk is a dynamo (actually an alternator). Energy for the write
comes from the write amplifier. In no case are the magnetic "particles"
moved.
Long seeks may slightly reduce the life of the head actuator bearing.
Vibration, high temperatures, and spin-up/spin-down are the dominant
wear-out mechanisms. They wear out the spindle bearing.
