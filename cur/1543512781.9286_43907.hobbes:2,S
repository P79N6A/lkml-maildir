Hello, world!
If you have any PCI related problems with 2.3.21, please try my new patch
available from 
ftp://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/pub/linux/pci/alpha/l-pci-2.3.21.gz
 .
Changelog:
o  Added pci_set_power_state() for waking up and suspending of PCI devices.
o  Added pci_enable_device() to be called by PCI drivers before they attempt
   to communicate with the device.  Asks low-level code to enable the regions
   and wakes up the device if it was suspended.
o  pci-i386: Enable the device only when asked by a driver, not automatically.
   Except for machines with BuggyBIOS (TM), drivers should work with no changes,
   I'll update them later.
o  Updated Documentation/pci.txt
o  pci-pc: Avoid IRQ 14 and 15.
o  devlist.h is now generated automatically from pci.ids, script included
o  pci-pc: Avoid asking BIOS for IRQ routing by default. Use "pci=biosirq"
   switch to activate it manually.
o  pci-pc: Recognize secondary buses on Compaq and RCC bridges (thanks
   to Doug Ledford for his 2.2 patch, I've only ported it to 2.3).
o  pci-pc: Avoid brute force peer bridge scans by default as it was superceded
   by chipset-specific hooks and IRQ table tricks. Use "pci=peer" if you
   really need it.
o  pci-i386: Don't try to manipulate resources of host bridges and classless
   devices, they are usually very strange.
				Have a nice fortnight
