So what about stopping the flaming here and implementing real statvfs/
fstatvfs syscalls instead of these horrible hacks glibc has to do currently?
Using our kstatfs infrastructure that should be dirt simple.
arch/sparc64/solaris/fs.c already has a template of a statvfs syscall for
solaris, although we could probably improve a little on that.
