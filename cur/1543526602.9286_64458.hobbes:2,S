I'm running 2.3.46.  Looks amazing from here, on my not so sophisticated
do-it-all home machine.  Responsive at 22 load(!!!)
Question: kampd seems to need 2% of my CPU (according to top) all the
time. Right now my machine has been up 6hours and its been running for
6minutes of that time.  What's it doing?  Can I turn it off?  Might not
seem like much, but thats nearly enough to play a mp3 ;) I just use APM
for poweroff-on-shutdown on this machine.  Here are my compile options for
APM ("not set" stuff zapped):
CONFIG_APM=y
CONFIG_APM_DO_ENABLE=y
CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE=y
I have the IDLE stuff turned on, but its disabled in the BIOS.  I must be
missing something obvious :( Could someone please enlighten me?  Im sure
its just a configuration thing that I'm doing wrong.  I couldnt dig up ANY
info on it at all... nothing in linux/Documentation, even google comes up
with nothing.
