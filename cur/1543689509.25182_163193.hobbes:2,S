That's fine. Do what you want at your own pace, with your own code. 
I don't think you understood my assertion of not working with you, though.  
I'm not going to wait around for you to merge my patches, or take more
abuse from you. I have better things to do, and a stringent time frame in
which to do them.
I recommend either a) accepting my changes and fixes, and help merge
Nigel's 2.4 changes into the base or b) accepting the fork, merging
Nigel's changes, and later trying to merge the two source bases.
