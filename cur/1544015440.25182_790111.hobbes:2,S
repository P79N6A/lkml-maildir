    USB: fix up suspend and resume for PCI host controllers
    This patch (as1192) rearranges the USB PCI host controller suspend and
    resume and resume routines:
To cause my suspend to ram problem with my Thinkpad T61p.
I can confirm that 
a81a81a25d3ecdab777abca87c5ddf484056103d works
and a0d4922da2e4ccb0973095d8d29f36f6b1b5f703  does not work.
Thing is, 29-rc1 with a0d4922da2e4ccb0973095d8d29f36f6b1b5f703  reverted also 
fails with suspend/resume. Seems that there was another problem introduced 
after that patch.
Anyway, back to usb: I also tested plain 2.6.28 + this patch:
plain 2.6.28: works fine
2.6.28 + this patch: does not work.
