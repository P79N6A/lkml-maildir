Subject: 2.5.8: preemption + SMP broken ?

My machine (4cpu x86) hangs while booting a kernel with SMP
and preemption enabled. It hangs while executing one of
the initcalls, probably BIO since that is where the
next boot message comes from during a successful boot with SMP
(or preemption) disabled.
Has anyone tried out preemption with SMP ?
Thanks
