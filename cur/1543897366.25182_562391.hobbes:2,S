Hmm.. I am thinking of a scenario when the file system supports some
individual flags, but does not support a particular combination of them.
Just for example sake, assume we have FA_ZERO_SPACE mode also. Now, if a
file system supports FA_ZERO_SPACE, FA_ALLOCATE, FA_DEALLOCATE and
FA_RESV_SPACE; and no other mode (i.e. FA_UNRESV_SPACE is not supported
for some reason). This means that although we support FA_FL_DEALLOC,
FA_FL_KEEP_SIZE and FA_FL_DEL_DATA flags, but we do not support the
combination of all these flags (which is nothing but FA_UNRESV_SPACE).

Is it really required ? I mean, why should we allow users not to update
ctime/mtime even if the file metadata/data gets updated ? It sounds
a bit "unnatural" to me.
Is there any application scenario in your mind, when you suggest of
giving this flexibility to userspace ?
I think, modifying ctime/mtime should be dependent on the other flags.
E.g., if we do not zero out data blocks on allocation/deallocation,
update only ctime. Otherwise, update ctime and mtime both.
