See attached transcript.  I did it using lvm/dm just to show it's not
an devicemapper problem.

ext4_journal_create is ancient code dating back to ext3/jbd, and even
there it's code which has been obsolete for about 6-7 years.  In fact,
I plan to remove ext4_journal_create, the journal_inum mount option,
and jbd2_journal_init_dev, because the supported way of creating a
journal is using mke2fs.  I need to double check and make sure ocfs2
isn't using jbd2_journal_init_dev before I remove it from the jbd2
layer, but really, this sort of thing should be done all in userspace.

See attached.   Works fine for me.

I'm not a dm guy, so I can't answer this, but I suspect the issue may
be a lock ordering issue.

jbd2_journal_create was only designed for creating inode-based
journals, and it's a deprecated function that will likely be removed
soon.

mke2fs -O journal_dev creates an external journal, but when you create
a filesystem, you need to specify need to specify location of the
external journal.    Hence:
	 mke2fs -O journal_dev /dev/extern_journal_dev
	 mke2fs -t ext4 -J device=/dev/extern_journal_dev /dev/filesystem_dev
As I said in my last message.  I've tested it, and it works Just Fine.
