And BTW, before you accuse me of FUD, I'm actually talking about the
fragmentation issues on which Mel I think mostly agrees with me at this
point.
Also have you really a rational reason why we should just up and accept
all these big changes happening just because that, while there are lots
of theoretical issues, the person pointing them out to you hasn't happened
to give you a concrete failure case. Oh, and the actual performance
benefit is actually not really even quantified yet, crappy hardware not
withstanding, and neither has a proper evaluation of the alternatives.
So... would you drive over a bridge if the engineer had this mindset?
