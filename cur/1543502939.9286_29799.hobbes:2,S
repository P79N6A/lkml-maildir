Why don't you look up Rik's OOM job-to-kill selector first. It has
the advantages that
  o it's stateless (no additional information to be saved
    per process)
  o it works solely from information available in the kernel
    at the time of OOM
  o it has just the bare minimum of what people call 'policy'
    ('intelligence' is a better word) to protect the system
    from severe harm
  o it does not consider which process requested the page
OOM can be caused by malicious DoS attacks or by harmless lusers [2] using a
desktop machine to run large programs. Rik's selector will offer quite good
protection against the malicious case and amost never fail to pick the right
job in the careless-user-case (the idea of minimizing work loss turns out to
be a good protection against the malicious adversary as well).
It requires a reliable detection that Linux is out of memory. I do not know
anything about that aspect. Let the gurus look into that. And it has a small
issue (IMHO) with jiffies wraparound when it calculates, in wall-clock time,
how long the process has been around. [1]
And, as Andrea pointed out to me, the selected job might not be scheduled
soon to handle the signal. [5]

I'm sure that for special cases much better algorithms can be constructed
with the help of userspace interaction (daemons, /proc, config files).
If these fail or are not there, however, the kernel should never just kill
the job which requests the page. That results in wild killing of jobs until
by chance the right one is hit, rendering the machine mostly useless. [4]
(At least not in a stable state so that it can be recommended for batch
operations). Even rebooting is better.
This problem is somewhat hidden by the fact that in most cases the memory
hog requests a series of pages in sequence and so things tend to work out
fine. That's good luck, but you can't rely on that.
Best regards,
Claus

Footnotes:
[1] The problem with jiffies wraparound could be attacked in the following
    ways:
    a) You accept that you have to reboot the machine before jiffies
       wraparound
    b) You accept that after jiffies wraparound some
       have-been-around-forever jobs might get killed
    c) You find a way of detecting whether a job has gone through a jiffies
       wraparound
    A simple suggestion for c would be that at jiffies state 0x00000000 and
    0x80000000 all jobs which have been around longer than 0x80000000 are
    marked with a special state bit. This quantizes the job's time-of
    existance as 0,1,2,...,0x7fffffff jiffies or "very long". That should be
    enough.
    That is, however, a job state required by OOM. And probably not clean
    enough for the gurus.
[2] Personally I'm mostly hit by the "I'm a stupid user" case. The stupid
    user is myself. Unfortunately I can't predict my own job sizes, and so
    I end up with this memory configuration:
   		      total    used    free  shared buffers  cached
   	 Mem:         62936   55508    7428   29228    4296   21544
   	 -/+ buffers/cache:   29668   33268
   	 Swap:      2104528    9172 2095356
    Before I run a large job, I figure out how many people are on my
    desktop box and set a proper ulimit[3]. Sigh. But I have been bitten
    once too often.
[3] Ulimits are not a good solution. They work on a single-process basis
    and not on the global machine level.
[4] Expecting all typical system programs to handle tight memory
    gracefully is probably an illusion.
[5] That a job is not easily killable is IMHO not a valid excuse to let
    it continue hogging memory. It just makes the solution harder.
