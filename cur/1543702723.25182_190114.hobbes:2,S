Hello again, after two days of trying to solve my problem I give up now.
I tried lots of diferent configurations, so I do not know if it is a
kernel BUG or what, because Ive seen similar threads in this mail-list
and in other lists, irc chats...
I definitevily giveup of trying use 2.6.x in that computer, if someone
wants to investigate what happened and need config files, logs or
whatever, just tell me...
I am sure it is a kernel-hardware interactuation problem, because there
is no configuration I can do for this to work... so... giveup...
Thanks anyway to all of you that took the time of reading this mail...
Pablo limon
