Yeah and as Christoph pointed out, a lot of big machines have IDE
based CD-ROMs.  And, there *are* some IDE disk subsystems with 1 TB
on an IDE bus and such, but there just aren't enough IDE busses or PCI
slots on most big machines to span out to the really high disk capacities
or large numbers of spindles.  But some of the compute engines could
either be net-booted (no local disk) or have a cheap, small disk for
boot, small static storage (couple hundred GB range) etc.  But most
people don't connect big machines to IDE drive subsystems.
