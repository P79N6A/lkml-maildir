I tend to think that #1 is the best option - it keeps things consistent
and it gives arch/board maintainers a framework in which to add the
support code at their leisure.   But it's something which would be best
worked through with the affected arch maintainers, please.
Which architectures are we talking about here?  ia64 and ppc?
