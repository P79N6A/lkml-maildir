generally i think you overstate the impact of this.
throughout the code, most of the impact is likened to the following:
   register_device(...)
      becomes
   devfs_register_device(...)
if you really want to get antsy about it, it's pretty easy to make a teeny little
macro that does the appropriate magics.
