the 1Mb block size is a bit of a red herring.  Unless you've
specifically increased the max_sector_size and are using an sg_chain
converted driver, on x86 the maximum possible transfer accumulation is
0.5MB.
I certainly don't rule out that increasing the transfer size up from
0.5MB might be the way to improve STGT efficiency, since at an 1GB/s
theoretical peak, that's roughly 2000 context switches per I/O; however,
It doesn't look like you've done anything that will overcome the block
layer limitations.
