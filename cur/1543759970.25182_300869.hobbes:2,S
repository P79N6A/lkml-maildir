Hi,
The current method of parameter passing to drivers build as a module is extremely usefull.
Modules don't have to write there own parsing code, there's a nice macro that can be used to document specifics of the parameter and so on.
Could we extend this method where we use the same methodology for inbound drivers? (Currently a lot of drivers use their own parameter parsing code when it comes to passing values at kernel boot time.)
so we could do the regular:
	insmod mcd io=0x340
for modules, or with kernel boot parameters:
	mcd.io=0x340
for in-kernel drivers.
My proposal would be to introduce something like:
DRIVER_PARM_DESC(variable, description);
DRIVER_PARM(variable, type, scope);
    where scope can be:
	PARM_SCOPE_MODULE	=> This parameter is used in module context.
	PARM_SCOPE_KERNEL	=> This parameter is used in kernel context.
	PARM_SCOPE_MODULE | PARM_SCOPE_KERNEL
				=> This parameter is used in both kernel and module context, which should be the default if scope is omitted.
What do you think?
