Hi,
I recieved an email from someone claiming to be stuck with Linux 2.4, due to 
relying on a Promise TX4200 disk controller (using the fdsata driver from 
promise's website, which is 2.4-only):
0000:01:09.0 RAID bus controller: Promise Technology, Inc.: Unknown device 
3519 (rev 02)
         Subsystem: Promise Technology, Inc.: Unknown device 3519
         Flags: bus master, 66Mhz, medium devsel, latency 64, IRQ 9
         I/O ports at dc00 [size=128]
         I/O ports at d800 [size=256]
         Memory at ff8ff000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=4K]
         Memory at ff8c0000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=128K]
         Expansion ROM at ff8e0000 [disabled] [size=64K]
         Capabilities: [60] Power Management version 2
What is the status of this on 2.6? I found a blank changeset (??) in the mail 
below, from 24th May:

Was this accidently removed, or is the sata_promise driver actually 
incompatible with this hardware?
Thanks,
Daniel
