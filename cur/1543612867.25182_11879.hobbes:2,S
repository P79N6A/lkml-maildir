I mentioned it somewhere, but it might not have been on the list. It

Yes, although I still think it's not a common problem. In general, if
you are tarring and untarring inodes, you take the whole directory and
put it all back again. Even the partitioning event is a corner case,
since you're most likely to install a new drive (and thus have no
inodes to "restore") and then partition. And even the obsolete
rc.devfs only saved away inodes which had been changed, not
everything.
However, if this concerns you, I can send a patch that effectively
restores the old behaviour for directories. It's just a matter of
grabbing the right lock, fiddling a flag and returning a different
entry. But I definately want to keep a warning message. I want there
to be some pain for broken or really obsolete configurations.
