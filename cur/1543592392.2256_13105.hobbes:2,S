Ditto - I'd like at least an option of the "incorrect" logo.  I can
(sorta) see not having it as the default.  But perhaps under the
'experimental drivers' tag, have an option of "Politically incorrect
framebuffer logo".  (If there isn't a huge outcry against it, I may work
up a patch - been meaning to get into kernel stuff, and this seems
relatively harmless.)
