Yes, something like that. (sorry for not being able to be more
concrete). The applications has "high activity" on a few files, not
spread activity throughout the volume.

What can i do to explore this theory? Can I disable caching of dentries
and see it go away? Does it fit the pattern that it is only the 
"open"-syscall that is hit (not read for example)?

When I disabled the NFS-server and rand my "real-world" program on a
single processor (make -j 1). It ran through fine. It basically
gets around 20 million chunks out of differnet file and assemble the
chuncks in a few other files. This processes more or less 5 individual
sections, so make can run effectively with a concurrency of 5.
I dont know if there can be any technical reasons for not seeing it on
internal attached disks? (other than I just hadn't been able to
reproduce the same error conditions there.
