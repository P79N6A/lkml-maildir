Tugrul,
If it is a firmware problem, the firmware is upgradable, but you have to get
the firmware from IBM rather than Seagate.  IBM has special firmware for
their ST (Seagate) OEM'd disks.
You can use the IBM utility (runs from a CD in DOS), or the sgdskfl utility
under Linux from scsirastools.sf.net.
But do verify the SCSI cabling/termination first.
Andy

	If it turns out to be a firmware problem, is the firmware
upgradeable
or do I have to buy a new drive, in which case is there a blacklist?
