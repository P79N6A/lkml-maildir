I think Xuan's algorithm is good, so I want to add to it.:-)  
Ragnar, I don't understand your objection to it.  It is always the case that if you specify real
time constraints that are impossible then they aren't met.
If you want to get fancy you could sort all expired time limit requests by blocknr.  This gives you
three lists: one list containing unexpired requests sorted by blocknr, another list containing
unexpired requests sorted by time, and a third containing expired requests sorted by blocknr.  Throw
in Andrea's/Netware's optimization objective, and you could have four lists: list 1 contains
unexpired requests sorted by blocknr, list 2 contains unexpired requests sorted by time until
expiry, lists 3a and 3b if not empty contain expired requests and are alternating queues in which
one list is being fulfilled and the other list is being added to at any given time, with the the
queues switching roles whenever the list being fulfilled becomes empty.
I like this model, and it probably isn't hard to code.  Maybe I can talk Xuan into giving it a
try?:-)
