Ah, yes...  The p-bricks, i-bricks, etc. right?
Yes, I suppose a round-robin return for the SGI version of the macro 
would work...  Certainly not ideal, but it would work.  The problem is 
if you assume that binding several processes to the node PCI bus X is on 
will ensure that those processes are on the same node.  In this case 
(SGI), it would be a false assumption.  I suppose that's what you get 
for assuming, though? ;)
Cheers!
