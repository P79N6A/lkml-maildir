Thanks for the explanation. I've set out to prove that it is called
from a user context only. If that fails, I'll come up with something
else, perhaps in_interrupt() check, or an extra parameter.

I think the above cannot apply, because sys_delete_module()
does this:
                spin_lock(&unload_lock);
                if (!__MOD_IN_USE(mod)) {
                        mod->flags |= MOD_DELETED;
                        spin_unlock(&unload_lock);
                        free_module(mod, 0);
                        error = 0;
                } else {
                        spin_unlock(&unload_lock);
                }
There's no way even to get near that check if the module
count is nonzero (well, minus "can_unload()", which is not 
used by sg, or anyone for that matter).
One more thing that was skipped in the header of my mail
was that the current code in scsi_register_device_module near
out_of_space flag simply DOES NOT WORK. There's an oops for
the show. It is possible to de-factor the scsi_unregister_device
into checking and non-checking version (perhaps one calling
the other), but why? So far it is proven that the check does
nothing (either it is not reached when files are open, or else
it is guaranteed to fail). This is why I suggest to remove
the check.
