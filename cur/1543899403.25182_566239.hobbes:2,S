Technically the queued locks require twice the size (but I think
the implementation can handle 256 CPUs with 16 bits, while dec based
can only handle 128 with 8 bits -- not a big deal I know, but we'll
probably get there soon).
However currently spinlocks are much bigger than they could be anyway
(4 bytes, could be 1). Although often the alignment of data structures
will make the gain not so big.
But that said, I don't like to justify slightly suboptimal code by
saying that existing code is even less optimal :)
One other upshot of the queued spinlocks is that they don't need
the break_lock field, or any of the associated logic with that
(because it is trivial to test whether a lock is held and also how
many others are spinning on it). So that gives us for free an
avenue into more advanced congestion or spin backoff algorithms.
