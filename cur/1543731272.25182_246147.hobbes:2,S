Stoop again.  This absolutely does not look like a change after which the
tree build, right?  After how many of the patches do we get a useable
kernel for SN2?  Please split your changes into LOGICAL steps, e.g.
 - dma mapping rework
 - usage of SAL interfaces
 - hwgrpah removal
 - renaming of files without code changes
 - addition of new hardware support
 - etc..
everything else is simply not reviewable. (and the above is intentionally
an order which I think would make sense)
