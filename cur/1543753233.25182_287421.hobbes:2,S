huh?? Who's mounting the root filesystem, then :) ?
If you mean that you can't get the BIOS to load the kernel for you, and 
you're loading the kernel from a floppy or something, you should know 
that some BIOS are pretty selective about what they consider a valid 
boot partition.
I recommend that you use fdisk to set up one partition as FAT16 type 
(even if you use another filesystem later), and make the partition 
active. You might need to write a proper MBR on the pen also (IIRC LILO 
as an option to do this).
You might also need to pass a special "disk=/dev/sda bios=0x80" (or 
something like that) option in your lilo.conf file, but that depends how 
far in the boot process you're hanging.
