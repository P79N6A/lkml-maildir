New drives will soon use 4096-byte sectors. This is a better
match for the normal (non-VAX!) page size and reduces overhead.

It's equal to typical modern designs like JFS, NTFS, XFS, and Reiserfs.
It's much worse than ZFS, which doesn't even trust the filesystem
to not silently scramble the data.
It's a tad worse than various forms of ext2/ext3/ufs/ufs2, where a
fixed layout helps recovery. (ext2 lacks the atomic updates, but
it doesn't trust a bad shutdown either -- fsck will always run)
BTW, a person with disk recovery experience told me that drives
will sometimes reorder the sectors. Sector 42 becomes sector 7732,
sector 880880 becomes sector 12345, etc. The very best filesystems
can handle with without data loss. (for example, ZFS) Merely great
filesystems will at least recognize that the data has been trashed.
