	Sigh...  Supposed fix to problems with stale inodes was completely
broken.
	What we need is "if we are doing last iput() on fs that is getting
shut, sync it and don't leave it in cache".  And yes, we have a similar
path in iput().  Similar, but not quite the same.
	Fix is
* new fs flag: "MS_ACTIVE".
* set after normal ->read_super().
* reset after we are done with fsync_super() in kill_super().
* iput() checking that and if it's set - doing write_inode_now() and kicking
it out of hash.
I'll send patch in ~10 minutes.
