Thanks a lot for the valuable info.

At the back of my mind, i'm still exploring on how much work will be
required to do non-PCI libata-SATA in 2.4.x.
{I mean the changes that need to be done in kernel-2.4.23 onwards to
support non-PCI libATA-SATA. By some means, I have access to
physically contiguous memory blocks which can be used to do
DMA-ScatterGather.}
A pointer from your side will help me in hitting the nail right,
otherwise I'll be hurting myself a lot later on :)
Thanks a lot once again.
