That's probably best.  I do agree that 2.5 is the place to play around with 
SCSI error handling first.
I'm willing to help re-do the error handler, since I've always thought that 
abort isn't a good first line of defence because it actually adds to the 
command burden of a failing drive.
Jens, if you want to share the code you already have (or point me to the 
bitkeeper repository where you keep it) I'll look it over.
As far as the back-port to 2.4, as long as you only support SCSI drivers that 
use the new error handler (so we don't have to worry about the obsolete one) 
that should be reasonably easy.
