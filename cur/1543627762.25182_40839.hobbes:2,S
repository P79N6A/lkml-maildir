Not quite.
As I said, -dj has an optimization in asm-i386/io.o:

So the preprocessed smpboot.c contains gems like:

...and...

Even though clustered_apic_mode is 0, the compiler still complains
about the second one and the first one doesn't depend on
clustered_apic_mode at all.
I don't like spreading around more #ifdef's, but the spirit of the
changes seemed to be to get rid of the declaration of xquad_portio
when !CONFIG_MULTIQUAD. Suggestions for improvement welcome.
