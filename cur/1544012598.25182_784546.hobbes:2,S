The ATA READ/WRITE LONG commands have been obsoleted in the past few ATA specs,
even though most drives continue to implement them.
But not a good avenue.
There's a separate effort, involving drive vendors and kernel hackers,
to provide end-to-end CRC protection of data.  I forget what it was called,
but that's the future of this stuff for high-reliability requirements.
