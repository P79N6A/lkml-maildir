i < clone_list[i].vendor_id != 0 is (i < clone_list[i].vendor_id) != 0 is
just i < clone_list[i].vendor_id, so the for is done for i = 0 and possibly
for 1. Getting this effect (if desired) with an if is a load clearer.
Having i twice in the condition is also highly suspicious... is this code
ever executed? It looks like a bad screwup in the condition that went
unnoticed because it was never hit.
