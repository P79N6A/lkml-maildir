If this is an old version of smartd, then this MAY be a bogus message, but
if it's not something is seriously wrong with the disk. You can check by
running smartctl: smartctl -a /dev/hdi
If the system is too unstable to boot, so that you can't run the command
above, then you can run smartctl from a bootable CD.
