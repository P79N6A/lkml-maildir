You mean blocksize is the size of the ext2 block, and s_blocksize is the
default size of the block device.

However, the bdev block size may be changed with sb_set_blocksize. It
doesn't actually have to match the hardware sector size -- if this
does matter for XIP, then I think you need some other check here.
