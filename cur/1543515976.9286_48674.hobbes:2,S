Hi Robert.

I use the following line with my ATAPI Zip-250 drive:
	/dev/hdd4	/zip	auto	noauto,user	0 0
Note that the 'user' implies noexec and nosuid so those do not need
stating as well. The only difference is the use of 'auto' instead of
'vfat' in the media type field, which allows me to use ext2 and vfat
disks interchangably.

The only thing that comes to mind is that the one supplied with RH 6.0
was 2.2.5-15 and there were supposed to be some important changes in
the update that was released as 2.2.5-22 so you may wish to suggest to
them that they upgrade to the later RPM.
Another option would be to upgrade to RH 6.1 which uses 2.2.12 as its
base kernel, and that shouldn't be hard.
The best option of all would be to download the 2.2.13 kernel tarball
and compile a custom kernel for those machines. However, if they've
only just started with Linux, they may be unwilling to do that.
Best wishes from Riley.
PS: The kernel versions page is now back online at the URL below, and
    includes separate sublists both for each kernel series, and for
    each year of development.
