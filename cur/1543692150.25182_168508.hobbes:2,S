Failed rather miserably == no 'prev' member in linuxState.misc? Then
it is fixed in vmware-any-any-update40... 
And except that this patch makes thing compilable, it also makes driver 
a bit friendlier to the MM subsystem, it allows you to use VMware on 
4G/4G host, and it properly handles bridged networking on adapters using 
hardware (or pseudohardware...) Tx checksumming (although only for IPv4 
due to features of dev_queue_xmit_nit).
