ucSystemType is a variable that is EXPORT_SYMBOL'ed but never used in 
any way.
_prep_type is a variable that is needlessly EXPORT_SYMBOL'ed.
But prep_init points to the real problem:
CONFIG_PPC_PREP requires code from arch/ppc/platforms/, but this 
directory is never visited.
What is the correct fix?
Migrate the code from arch/ppc/platforms/ to arch/powerpc/platforms/ ?
