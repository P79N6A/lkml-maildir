Probably I'm not trying to do what you want. I analyzed locks for other
usb drivers in 2.4 tree and used same ideas.
Static lock minor_table_mutex is used for minor table structure.
And dev->sem for dev manipulations and that's why for open_count.
If you will simply browse /drivers/usb dir for 2.4 you will see that
such approach is widely used there.
What's not right?
Certainly, you have more experience so I can't say that I'm right.

Yes, got it. It's up for minor_table_mutex in adu_release. Corrected.

Let's do everything correctly for 2.4.
