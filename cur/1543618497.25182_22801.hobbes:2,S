Well, I don't know about that specific machine, but HP LP6000 boxes
reserve 700MB (!) for PCI hot-plug support.  So my 4GB boxes are
actually 3.3GB boxes.  Can't override it, says HP.  They wouldn't refund
70% of the price of a 1GB stick, either. ;)
I suspect what you're seeing is along the same lines; perhaps PCI
hotplug or some other reservation that may be tweakable in the PowerEdge
BIOS.  Dell may or may not be able to help.
FWIW; good luck,
