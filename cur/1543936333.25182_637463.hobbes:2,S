I've now booted 2.6.21.7, we'll see. The problem with the bisection is
that I can't explicitely trigger the bug so I can't say for sure if a
kernel is good or it is just needs more time to trigger. The average
uptime of this machine is just a couple hours a day.
For example, with 2.6.24-rc6 it took over 3 hours for the first disk to
trigger the bug and the second disk needed more than 7 hours. This
machine is seldom turned on for that long.
