I am making a board right now, with an AMD Elan SC520 chip, flash rom,
SDRAM, eepro100 ethernet controller, etc for embedded use. I plan to
boot linux on this system without buying a BIOS. One problem seems to
be SDRAM sizing and initializing. I believe that the kernel can handle
a PCI controller without a BIOS, but I have not verified this. My card
is "headless" (no vga), so I am relying on the serial console.

APM requires Intel Pentium System Management Mode (SMM/SMI), I am not
share if this is under NDA, like the Intel BIOS writers guide (sp?).
