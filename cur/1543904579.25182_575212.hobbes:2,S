Subject: [PATCH] .gitignore update
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/26/149

Somehow I ended up with the following in tree:
	$ git status
		...
	# Untracked files:
	#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	#
	#       fs/proc/root.o.FuMxJQ
	#       net/ipv4/tcp_minisocks.o.geCDYR
These are presumably temporary gcc files, which aren't interesting.
