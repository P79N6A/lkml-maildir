You poor americans!  We in Europe (and elsewhere in the world) have
known for years that this is a "feature" of readline...
Just create a $HOME/.inputrc like this:
  set meta-mode                   on
  set convert-meta                off
  set output-meta                 on
And bash will happily display german umlauts and whatever.
Now back to real kernel problems...
Yours,
  Dominik Kubla
