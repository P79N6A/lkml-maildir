Yep, that's clear ... nevertheless it should be possible to avoid such
cases by adding smarter calculations for the `limit' than mine :-)

kswapd isn't swappable therefore `p == current && rss < limit' would work.
My small patch points out that avoiding the page request calling swap_in()
will increase performance even if swap cache avoids I/O from disk.
This was what page aging was good for.
