Um, this is not the developers fault.  Do you think the vendors call the
driver developers to tell them "hey, we just released a new product,
with a name confusingly similar to the one your driver supports, but we
changed the chipset a tiny bit so it won't work with your driver"?
Dream on.
Driver developers are not psychic.  If no USER reported that the new
FooBar1002X is completely different from the FooBar1002, there's no way
for us to know.  Sorry you were unfortunate enough to be the first user
to learn the hard way.  Complain to the vendor not LKML.
