Well evidently it should be root-only, just like SCHED_RR and SCHED_FIFO.
If the priority inversion issues are worked out this restriction could be
removed. I remember discussing this problem with Rik van Riel.
The kernel-preempt patch seems to be able to detect when a process holds a
lock; perhaps the process scheduler can temporarily revert to SCHED_NORMAL
when this is the case? Preferably with a large nice value.
