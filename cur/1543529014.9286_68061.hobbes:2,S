It is impossible, there are only two options for module symbols.
Either they are local to a module (only the module can see them) or
they are exported (every other module can see them).  BTW, you can
export static symbols, the EXPORT_SYMBOL mechanism is almost
independent of the compiler's idea of static vs. global.
