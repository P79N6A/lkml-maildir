I think if somebody, by example will show how it can be handled in more
convenient way, that will eventually become mainstream. As we know,
nothing gets from vacuum just like that, without taking energy and time.
And my question was not about this social problem of acceptance, support
etc.
Linus had spent some time in this thread trying to explain what problems
are: as from that (social, think scheduler :) POV, as also from
"zarro bogs found" one.
Also, after i saw Linus' message about doing mostly tools last couple of
years, i wonder why you, Adrian, didn't think about your tools first,
before you've started regression tracking? You are not running in front
of a train, unlike you know who does, plus bugzilla issues are known for
years. Luckily Fedora kernel guys also upstream developers, thus lkml and
other MLs under their view.
After having read all that, i've asked you, my question, as the person
who supposedly used BTS as a maintainer.
Yes, in current form it might not be in suitable configuration, i.e.
kernel sub-systems instead of packages etc, anyway main thing is the way
BTS is handled. While i was looking and replying for bug reports in the
Debian kernel, that i saw in lkml, i've noticed, just how guys work with
it there. Now they even came up with tracking upstream bugzilla, it
seems [0]. I left that activity due to RL some months ago, but now trying
to catch up things again.
Thus it's just my curiosity about all this. And BTS is like, you know,
why not, if it fits by mostly all parameters?

So, as i've wrote before: one must give them pretty-shiny tool, kindly
barking in their inboxes, instead of for example
"Guilty: **** ***** <????@****.com>",
as it was on the very beginning.
