this somehow seems to match something completely non-related (a function pointer 
declaration case):
ERROR: no space between function name and open parenthesis '('
#7278: FILE: drivers/net/e1000e/hw.h:434:
+       bool (*check_mng_mode)(struct e1000_hw *);
even if I put a space between ")(", it still complains.
