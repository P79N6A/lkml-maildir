It is somewhat rude, but it makes sure that the error gets fixed. [And
it also appears safer to me: if we know error already happened we opt
to stop the system so nothing bad happens.]
Questions:
1) is it possible to do hardware damage from powernow-k8 driver?
2) should some of those checks be fatal?
3) for nonfatal checks, is it possible to use WARN_ON() -- warn and
continue?
4) given good hardware and debugged driver, will any of those
BUG_ON()s ever trigger?
