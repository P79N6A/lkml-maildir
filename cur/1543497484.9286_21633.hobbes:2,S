On possible solution to this problem is to declare that kernel option names are
case and punctuation insensitive.  (Note that I am refering to the names, not
their values.)  The code which parses the options line could convert all of the
left hand sides to lower case and delete dots, hyphens, and underscores.
Of course, all the code which reads option values would have to be changed
to look for the `cleaned-up' names.
I don't know if this is a good idea, but I can think of a few arguments in its
favour.  One is that if the option is incorrectly capitalized or punctuated
there is not error message generated.  My suggestion would fix this problem,
though it wouldn't help if the option name were misspelled.  The second reason I
can think of is that it is probably bad policy anyway to have two options which
differ only in case or punctuation.  Adopting my suggestion would make it
impossible.
Any comments?
