The URL for the patch is on top of the hacking document, thinking that 
those who don't read it won't need the URL.
Yes the patch is intended for 2.5 if you all want it. However it 
applies to 2.4.0 for those who need it right now. As stated it requires 
some extra work that can't be done by myself alone.

Compatibility: Just using timespec instead of timeval at the user-level.
Seconds are still 32bit on 32 bit machines.

That's exactly the point: For a i486 you must use the timer's counter 
register to interpolate between interrupts, but for the Pentium you can 
use the cycle counter of the CPU. When making a kernel for a 
distribution, you can't know whether the system will have a Pentium, so 
the decision is made during boot. (Just as it was before)
The old naming put stress on speed of the routines (I guess), while I 
put stress on the accuracy. So "poor" means "poor accuracy".

You mean to say that a leap second is an implicit time update? I can 
Implement it without any trouble, if you all can agree that the idea is 
acceptable. BTW: Same applies for RTCs using local time, and we switch 
from/to DST: The kernel doesn't have the tables, so you (or cron) must 
update the /proc/sys/kernel/time/timezone.
I'd be glad if these were the only problems you had. ;-)
