actually it's different I think (based on a brief inspection of the
code, I could well be wrong): 
get_request_wait() causes a get_request() call with a GFP_NOIO gfp_mask
which perculates upto cfq_set_request() as argument.
cfq_set_request() then calls the inline cfq_get_queue() (which isn't in
the backtrace due to inlining) which does
                } else if (gfp_mask & __GFP_WAIT) {
                        /* 
                         * Inform the allocator of the fact that we will
                         * just repeat this allocation if it fails, to allow
                         * the allocator to do whatever it needs to attempt to
                         * free memory.
                         */
                        spin_unlock_irq(cfqd->queue->queue_lock);
which enables interrupts right smack in the middle of holding a whole
bunch of locks.....
so to me it looks like lockdep at least has the appearance of moaning
about a reasonably fishy situation...
