agreed, but do you really have to strace the OpenVZ
tools so often, as I don't see any other purpose 
for cross space strace. usually you strace either
inside or outside the space, as the transition is
not that well defined anyway ...

not all spaces will be done fur the purpose of
migration, some of them might have other purposes

ah, I'm glad to share my experience here ...
the linux-vserver.org wiki shows some of those
real world usage scenarios, which include, but are
not limited to:
 - Administrative Separation
 - Service Separation
 - Enhancing Security (better chroot)
 - Easy Maintenance (hardware independance)
 - Testing
most application scenarios do not require a complete
VPS or Guest to make them usable, often only a single
* space would suffice to accomplish the goal ...
best,
Herbert
