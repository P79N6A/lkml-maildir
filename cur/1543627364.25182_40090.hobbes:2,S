Hi,
This is a known problem I know, the screen problem
with some athlon computer due to some PCI optimization
code  etc..; but how can I work around this. For
2.4.19-pre2 I remember to go somewhere to find pci.c
and comment out the code related, but in
2.4.19-pre6aa1 I got stuck..
Is there an official way to overcome/fix this problem
? (kernel build option?) Or just anyone interested in
doing such job?
Please help and copy your reply to my email address.
Thanks a lot
