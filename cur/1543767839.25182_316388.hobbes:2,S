I remember I had memory corruption problems with an old version of
Etherboot few years ago. The machines were mostly AMD K6 based,
network cards were SMC EPIC100 (Etherpower II) and/or RTL 8139.
Memtest86 (downloaded with Etherboot) complained about random errors.
I think Linux didn't show any such illness.
This was Etherboot 4.something. Upgrading to 5.something fixed the
problem.
I suspect you're using Etherboot newer than 4.x though. I'd probably
give memtest86 loaded from network a try.
