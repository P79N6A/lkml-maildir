actually I get the message with RH's 7.1 stock kernel, with 2.4.7 (patched
with mosix 1.1.2) and with 2.4.9-ac12. it's always there, waiting for me. I
kind of think to remove the printk, just as Alan suggested, because they are
_very_ annoying. I have big hard disks, but I wouldn't like to have them
filled with logs containing mostly this message :)
