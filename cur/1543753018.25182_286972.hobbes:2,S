Well, that's really a core problem. We don't want to duplicate 
infrastructure, which practically does the same. So if relayfs isn't 
usable in this kind of situation, it really raises the question whether 
relayfs is usable at all. We need to make relayfs generally usable, 
otherwise it will join the fate of devfs.
