You can do so using if.
See following example:
--------------------------------------------------------------
config ONLY_HAVE_ONE
	prompt "only have one?"
	boolean
if ONLY_HAVE_ONE
config FOO
	bool foo
	default y
endif
if !ONLY_HAVE_ONE
choice
	prompt "multiple values"
	default VAL_FIRST
config VAL_FIRST
	bool "First value"
config VAL_SECOND
	bool "Second value"
endchoice
endif
--------------------------------------------------------------
You should be able to modify this for the usage you ask for.
Hope this is useful,
	Sam
