Unfortunately you miss my point (which is probably too simple to be clearly
visible):
I want to give some feedback on a topic/problem I am experiencing since _long_.
I was _asked_ to do so. Additionally I am stating my _opinion_. I am _not_
telling anybody what to do. I am not in a position to do so. Very likely only
_few_ people are in such a position, very likely the maintainer of aic and
hopefully Marcelo.
Have you read all available bug reports Justin got? If you have not, don't play
with numbers.
Another personal opinion: software development tends to make things possible
that "cannot be". ;-)
Regards,
Stephan
