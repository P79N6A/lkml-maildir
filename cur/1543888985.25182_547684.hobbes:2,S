Since it evaluates to absolutely empty code during pre-processing, there 
is no obvious value. The question is whether there is some odd hackish 
non-obvious value, I'd expect. (I'd also expect that to be another "no".)
If something that evaluates to nothingness ("There was nothing left...not 
even a hole!") actually does anything, then somebody in the 
standards-compilers-users pipeline needs to be violently beaten for 
stupidity.
