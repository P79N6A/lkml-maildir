Subject: SMP/scheduler in 2.2.0-pre6 less parrallel?

running two quake2 games in parrallel might not be the best test for
SMP, but so far it worked great. I have two P2's wich together were
about 200% busy when running two quake2 games on X-window. This worked
great on about 2.1.126. I didn't try this until today with 2.2.0-pre6,
for demonstration purposes. As usual demo's fail: Both the quake2 games
didn't use more than 150 %CPU, and they did run smooth at all (which
they did in 2.1.126).
I don't consider the fact that I can't run two quake2 games a real
problem. It might however mean there's something wrong: the parallelism
might be reduced. Do others experience "real problems" like this?
