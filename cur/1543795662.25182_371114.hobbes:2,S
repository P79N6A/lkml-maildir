Yes.

Ah you mean the Alpha exception? Right Alpha would need that.
Thanks for the review.

Revised patch with Alphaextrawurst.
----
As discussed in other thread.
 
Just needed an additional write barrier, so that a parallel
running lockup can never see inconsistent state. As long as there
is no unregistration or the unregistration is done using
locking or RCU in the caller they should be ok now.
This only makes a difference on non i386/x86-64 architectures.
x86 was already ok because it never reorders writes.
