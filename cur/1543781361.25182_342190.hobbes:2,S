I think most of this is premature cleanup. As it also changes the logic in 
small ways, I'm not even sure it qualifies as a cleanup.
The only obvious patch is the PPS code removal, which is fine.
For the rest I can't agree on to move everything that aggressively into 
the ntp namespace. The kernel clock is controlled via NTP, but how it 
actually works has little to do with "network time". Some of the 
parameters are even private clock variables (e.g. time adjustment, phase), 
which don't belong in any common code. (I'll expand on that in the next 
mail.)
bye, Roman
