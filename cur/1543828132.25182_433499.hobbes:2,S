Well, if every process had a page of its own, what would the context 
switch overhead be?
But, I'm not advocating exporting anything. Though I sort of like the 
vgetcpu() idea because I was working on a user-space slab allocator 
recently and magazines could use vgetcpu() instead of pthread keys.
(Also means if threads > cpus I'd get better results).
Thanks,
