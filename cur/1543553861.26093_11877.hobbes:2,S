UPDATE:
Thanks to Andre's 2.2.18pre19 patch, we're making progress!  This time I
had 4 hrs 10 min uptime before it locked up.
And this time, it only said 
hde: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hde: dma_intr: error=0x10 { SectorIdNotFound }, LBAsect=15347359,
sector=15347328
once, instead of repeating that error 4 times.  
What should I try now?  Maybe I'll give 2.4.0-test10 another shot, but
last time I tried it, it corrupted my raid5 array.
What next...
