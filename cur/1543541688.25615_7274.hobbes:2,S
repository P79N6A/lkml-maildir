And of course, switching external cache back on in the BIOS fixes this.
Sorry for the missteak.

Oh, and I should mention it also fixes the problem of the interactive
performance going out the window for quite a while under heavy I/O load
(eg, copying untarred kernel source tree to backup)  Not sure how bad
this affects rich folks with SCSI systems, but it sucks large rocks for
us poor bastards with IDE (even with UDMA/33).
