Dave's patch removes the entry for the card with the 0x5b60.
According to his bug report, Mauro has a Radeon X300SE that should 
have the 0x5b70 according to pci.ids from pciutils and that doesn't seem 
to be claimed by the DRM driver (and the dmesg from the bug report 
confirms that the radeon DRM driver didn't claim to be responsible for 
this card).

The ID removed by Dave's patch is the only ID listed for an RV370 chips 
(the other RV370's aren't listed in the radeon DRM driver).
I suspect Dave and Mauro having unrelated problems.
