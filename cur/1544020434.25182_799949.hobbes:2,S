Correct.

To finish the conversion of everything to kthreads from kernel_thread
we need to be able to call kthread_stop on threads that call do_exit.
That kthread_stop cannot be called on such threads is currently a major
deficiency of the kthread api.

No.  This patch does not overload or really abuse vfork_done.
vfork_done is named a bit misleadingly.  It should arguably be called
mm_done.  vfork_done (if set) always points to a completion that will
be completed when do_exit() -> mm_release() is called.
What we want is some completion called from inside of do_exit.
mm_release happens to be such a completion and the code already
exists.
If mm_release did not do: tsk->vfork_done = NULL then the entire
test of if (k->vfork_done != NULL) would be unnecessary.
Oleg on that note we should not need a barrier at all. We should be
able to simply say: 
cmplp = k->vfork_done;
if (cmplp){
	/* if vfork_done is NULL we have passed mm_release */
	kthread = container_of(cmplp, struct kthread, exited);
	kthread->should_stop = 1;
	wake_up_process(k);
	wait_for_completion(&kthread->exited);
}
Thinking of it I wish we had someplace we could store a pointer
that would not be cleared so we could remove that whole confusing
conditional.  I just looked through task_struct and there doesn't
appear to be anything promising.
Perhaps we could rename vfork_done mm_done and not clear it in
mm_release.
