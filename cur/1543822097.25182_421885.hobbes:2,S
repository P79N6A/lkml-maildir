How about  comparing /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/topology/core_id and
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/topology/core_id values?
On my northwood ht (single core) cpu0/topology/core_id and
cpu1/topology/core_id contain "0". For dual core system should be
something like
cpu0/topology/core_id = 0
cpu1/topology/core_id = 0
cpu2/topology/core_id = 1
cpu3/topology/core_id = 1

Michal
