How about this?
int printk_improve(const char* filename, int line_no, 
	const char* function_name, int module_buf_idx, ...);
#define printk(PRINTF_ARGS...) \
	printk_improve(__FILE__, __LINE__, __FUNCTION__, \
		CUR_MODULE_BUF_IDX, ##PRINTF_ARGS);
1) If anyone is going to add this to the kernel, please make sure
printk_improve also log the TSC, current_process_id (if avail), etc.  
Very useful for performance profiling and failure analysis.
2) The next imporvement is to able to log to different buffers as 
suggested, such as ethernet driver logging goes to its own buffer, 
filesystem goes to its own buffer.  
2a) If you implement logging to multiple buffers, you need to 
make sure there is a global counter that atomically increment 
for all the events regardles which buffer it goes to.   
I used it in our project (RTOS, non-linux, yet...).  
It is very powerful to debug any SMP bugs caused by timing and 
race condition.
3) After that you need to get special BIOS so that we can log the 
buffer to a section of memory that is preserved after reset.   
With this, you can easily postmortem diagnostic any problem that 
crash the kernel/ISR/Driver.   This is much easily to do in 
embedded projects as compare to PC, since we control the BIOS.
Did all these in few of my projects already, it is wonderful 
way to debug any "completely lockup" problem with RTOS/ISR/Kernel.
The nice thing is that I don't have to ask anyone to reproduce
the problems.  The logging is always on.
