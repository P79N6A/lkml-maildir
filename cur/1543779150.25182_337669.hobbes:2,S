Hello,
I've attached a gzipped version of my Wireless Security Lock patch
for v2.6.13-rc4.
A Wireless Security Lock (WSL or weasel :-) is made up of two parts.
One part is a receiver which you plug into any available USB port.
The other part is a transmitter which at fixed intervals sends
"ping packets".
A "ping packet" usually consists of an ID and a flag telling if the
transmitter has just been turned on.
Both devices lights up in a nice way when a "ping packet" is send/
received.
The whole idea of this is that when the transmitter is brought out
of range one could have a process (such as xscreensaver) lock the
display.
The WSL is a toy gadget.
For more information see:

The WSL driver touches these files:
	drivers/usb/Makefile			(1 line)
	drivers/usb/input/Kconfig		(10 lines)
	drivers/usb/input/Makefile		(1 line)
	drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c		(2 lines)
	drivers/usb/input/wsl.c			(224 lines)
This is my first driver for Linux - feel free to harass me if I am
not following procedures or you think the driver is lame.  Better still,
educate me :-)
