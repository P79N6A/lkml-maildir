Huh?
Stale file handles are a result of user error (i.e. deleting a file on
the server while it is still in use on another NFS client). The only way
to "resolve" them is by application of a carefully designed end-user
education program that teaches how not to ssh to another machine and
then do "rm" on the file that is being edited.
