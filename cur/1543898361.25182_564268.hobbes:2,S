ok, but what then does it mean to read that this driver:
1) *requires* a number of user-space tools, and
2) these tools don't work with the 2.6 kernel?
how then does this driver have any value under 2.6 if it requires
user-space support that doesn't exist for 2.6?
obviously, i'll withdraw the patch, but it's still a mystery to me how
that driver can have any value under a 2.6 kernel, just based on
what's written above.
