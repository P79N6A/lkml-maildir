IntEventSet = vendorSpecific + softInterrupt + ack_tardy + phyRegRcvd +
cycleTooLong + unrecoverableError + cycleInconsistent + cycleLost +
cycle64Seconds + cycleSynch + phy + regAccessFail + selfIDComplete +
selfIDComplete2 + [reserved...?] + lockRespErr + postedWriteErr + RSPkt
+ RQPkt + ARRS + ARRQ + respTxComplete + reqTxComplete
(The bit 00004000 is not standardized and shouldn't be there. Whatever.)
That's a lot of stuff that happened right before this last print macro.
Maybe ages were spent in hpsb_selfid_complete. I will try to work on
getting non-critical parts out of hpsb_selfid_complete issue during the
week, but I don't know how fast I can do this and if this will help in
the first place.

Posted writes are still enabled. phys_dma=0 disables only the physical
response unit. You have to change the source if you want to disable
posted writes. See the top of ohci_initialize. Should this be a module
load parameter too?
