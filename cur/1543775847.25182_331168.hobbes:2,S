Sander,
	Sorry for not making myself clear "In one we suspend the drive and in the
other we park the drive" means that it would be nice to do that in Linux. We
don't have to do things like Windows does them. We can improve them to our
needs.
	In windows, there are 2 Simbols. 1. When the drive detects vibration and
then pauses the HD(yellow II sign in the taskbar) 2. When the HD is stop
when a free fall is detected. (Red simbol in the Taskbar)
	Please check it out in windows so you can see what I'm talking about.
.Alejandro
