it'll be a LOT easier for you to rewrite the Makefile such that you
don't get .a files but a .o file similar to how the rest of kbuild
operates.... while we do use .a files for linking into the vmlinux.. for
modules it's probably not the best of ideas
(and there's not really an advantage do doing so either anyway)
