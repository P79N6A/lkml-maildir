I think we're trying to gain different things from inode based
clustering...I'm not worried that the inode be next to the data.  I'm
going under the assumption that most of the time, the FS will try to
allocate inodes in groups in a directory, and so most of the time the
data blocks for inode N will be close to inode N+1.
So what I'm really trying for here is data block clustering when
writing multiple inodes at once.  This matters most when files are
relatively small and written in groups, which is a common workload.
It may make the most sense to change the patch to supply some key for
the data block clustering instead of the inode number, but its an easy
first pass.
