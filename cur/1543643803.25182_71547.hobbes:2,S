You may pull this off on /dev/hda or /dev/hdb, but Linux has set a policy
to default to CHS regardless if LBA should be used.  What really needs to
be fixed is to default to LBA and not CHS.  The problem is everybody will
scream bloody murder.
This is why 48-bit devices killed CHS, it is too brain dead to survive but
for the life of me it continues.

Heads up!
If the device is 48-bit capable, but the swap area to dump to is inside
the 28-bit addressable region, you can call it with 28-bit commands.

OIC, that is nice to know you are not able to tank the driver even when
abusing it.
