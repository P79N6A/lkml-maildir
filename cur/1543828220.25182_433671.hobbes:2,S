Marcelo,
I think I have not sent you this one. It looks valid to me.
I can queue it in -upstream if you prefer to pull everything
at once.
Cheers,
Willy

Subject: [PATCH] bug fix for 2GB core limit in 2.4
We were having problems when running programs that used over 2GB of ram
not being able to generate core files over 2GB, these are some very
simple changes that fixed the problem.
The changes have been running on many Debian systems for a couple of
months.  Valid core files just over 3GB have been created without any
problem.
