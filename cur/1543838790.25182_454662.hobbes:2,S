Huh?  16550 not 16650.  Did you miss this?
        outb(UART_FCR_ENABLE_FIFO       /* Enable FIFO's (if available) */
             | UART_FCR_CLEAR_RCVR      /* Clear receiver FIFO */
             | UART_FCR_CLEAR_XMIT      /* Clear transmitter FIFO */
             | UART_FCR_TRIGGER_4       /* Set FIFO trigger at 4-bytes */
        /* NOTE: interrupt generated after T=(time)4-bytes
         * if less than UART_FCR_TRIGGER bytes received
         */
             ,uart->base + UART_FCR);   /* FIFO Control Register */
