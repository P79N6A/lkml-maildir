It's not intentionally different, and really only might be different in
the we have ttySX case, but ttySX isn't registered to KGDB case.

It's only been needed on ia64.  But it's moot since I've reworked things
for kgdb8250= is always a complete override.

Hmm.  I'll give that a shot momentarily... That sounds like a good idea
