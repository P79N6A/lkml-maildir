 - updated!
Hrm, how can I run memtest when I can't even allocate all the RAM without crashing, surely memtest can't allocate all 128 MB of it when it's not available from the kernel (hence malloc() won't do)...
But that really isn't the issue, because I _don't_ think (IMHO) that a little bad RAM will cause a kernel panic such as this.
Marius.
