Oh, an example of it working:
	# vol_id /dev/sda3
	ID_FS_USAGE=filesystem
	ID_FS_TYPE=ext3
	ID_FS_VERSION=1.0
	ID_FS_UUID=9d2efd53-6b5a-4f84-86cc-def71269b7ca
	ID_FS_LABEL=
	ID_FS_LABEL_SAFE=
	# vol_id -t /dev/sda3
	ext3
	# vol_id -u /dev/sda3
	9d2efd53-6b5a-4f84-86cc-def71269b7ca
It also shows just the label if you have one set (I don't on this
disk...)
thanks,
