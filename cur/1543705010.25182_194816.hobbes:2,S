You should at least compare apples to apples, that is:
sizeof (*foo) + 1
vs
sizeof(*foo) + 1
But I guess that was just a typo?  Of course, since the ()'s are useless
here anyway, and doesn't really bring any added bonus, we end up with
sizeof *foo + 1
vs
sizeof*foo + 1
and I'd say the latter looks rather confusing, if not for anything else
because
sizeoffoo
would be invalid code, while
sizeof foo
is perfectly valid.
This is the same as
return *foo;
vs
return*foo;
I personally regard the former to be preferable, but it's it's a
preference, not a something I'd die over.
