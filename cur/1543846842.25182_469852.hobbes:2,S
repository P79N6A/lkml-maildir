But we already do that. This is a part of the log from a 2.6.18 kernel:
SCSI device sda: 390721968 512-byte hdwr sectors (200050 MB)
sda: Write Protect is off
sda: Mode Sense: 00 3a 00 00
SCSI device sda: drive cache: write back
 sda: unknown partition table
(SATA disk without partition table. It's one out of four components for
a RAID5 MD array).
Reading the partition table from an unpartitioned device *is* a
success. If that's what the user wanted, then yes, that will make him
happy.
If we let the kernel return an error like you propose, we will get a
lot of bug reports from users plugging in their new and shiny disk:
Kernel finds no partition table and throws an error. User thinks his
shiny disk is faulty, lkml tells him it's not, user then asks why the
kernel throws an error...
