$SUBJECT ... (Probably known, but still..)
It used to work properly with 2.4.25-pac1 / 25-pac1+26pre1.
I first thought that I mismerged something from the 25-pac1
tree into 26-rc1, but the pristine kernel doesn't seem to
behave either.
dmesg output attached. Can provide more info if necessary.
Please CC me on replies.
