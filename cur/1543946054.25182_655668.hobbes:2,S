Has the system already switched to highres/nohz mode at this point ?

There is nothing which switches it off, except right at the point
where the machine is shutdown. It's definitely active during the
freeze period.

To be wrong for 500ms, the TSC must freeze completely.

It should detect it, but I have to check, why it does not work in that
particular case.

Wrong. Newer CPUs have TSCs which are not affected by cpu frequency.

Wrong. C3 stops the TSC everywhere. C2 should not, but it does
unfortunately due to stupid BIOS implementations and on a lot of AMD
CPUs.

Wrong. I'm writing this mail from a SMP machine with perfectly
sychronized TSCs.

At least 5.
One sensible solution would be to force TSC unstable before we
suspend, but I'd like to know why that 10sec delay happens at all.
Can you please provide a dmesg log ?
