We use this case so we don't have to maintain 2 /slightly/ different
versions of the source, as we're distributing this module outside of
the kernel tree for use with kernel 2.4.x.
Moreover I asked Greg to push this module into the 2.4 tree if
possible, so as long as there aren't major changes in the 2.5 code
I'd really like to keep the same source for 2.4 and 2.5.
But if this should become a hassle for anybody, I'll remove this case
ASAP.
JB.
