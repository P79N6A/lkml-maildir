No, I'm just trying to get agreement on the generic infrastructure for
process containers and extensibility - the actual API to the memory
controller (i.e. what limits, what to track, etc) can presumably be
fitted into  the generic mechanism fairly easily (or else the
infrastructure probably isn't generic enough).
