I jumped the gun, actually - the build was still running, and there's at
least 6 other things that trigger the same serialP.h warning - where there's
a #if (VAR < NNNN) check that Does The Wrong Thing because of the default
gcc behavior for undefineds.  Hopefully this one's harmless - but there's
still 608 other warnings to work through.
