	It's been pointed out to me that this isn't clear.  What I mean
is that mknod(8), ls(1), and other programs assume dev_t mappings that
are usually based upon the MAJOR() macro and friends.  This means that
any modification of the dev_t arrangement may require source fixes and
may not, depending on how smart MAJOR() is, but will absolutely require
a new compile of the software to pick up the new MAJOR() macro.
	Peter is right, we only want to do this once.
