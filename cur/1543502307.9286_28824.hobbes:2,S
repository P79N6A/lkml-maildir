The whole point is you can't make select _extremely_ accurate, unless the
machine is idle. Any machine activity has the potential to make screen
updates stutter. Stuttering is _very_ bad for the perceived visual quality
of motion. Most visual flow things look far better if you miss the odd
frame update, but get the ones that do occur to happen exactly on time.
That way a short term machine overload causes just a hiccup in the flow.
Select will always cause visually unpleasant jitter, even if its timing is
much better than today's.

"Good enough" isn't good enough. When the next scheduling occurs after a
missed event, the schedular would already know an event was missed. It
might as well tell the app. and avoid a wasteful call to gettimeofday.
