For SGI related linux info take a look at 
http://oss.sgi.com
. SGI is 
involved in many projects. They have their XFS file system ported over to
linux. It should be finished by 02/2000. I'm personally redesigning the
/dev/graphics drivers for linux-SGI so linux can support a true direct
rendering engine. Possible port it to othe rlinux platforms. Thats the
site below. Unfortunely I haven't worked on the web pages. Just been busy
coding it. Also this project is not SGI supported.
