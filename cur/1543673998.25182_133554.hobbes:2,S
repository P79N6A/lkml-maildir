I'm 200% sure:
1. tar jxvf linux-2.5.69.tar.bz2
2. zcat 2.5.69-mm6.gz | patch  -p1
3. make menuconfig
There is something in the Yamaha DS-XG PCI driver (I think the problem
lies in alsa_card_ymfpci_init()) that is somewhat corrupting the PCI
ID's table, or something else, that's causing the pci_bus_match()
function to oops.
I'm no kernel expert, so I've been unable to guess much more than this.
