LAPIC is preferred because it is cheaper to reprogram, but if LAPIC
doesn't work (e.g. due to AMD C1E) it should fall back to HPET.

Yes it should. Something must be indeed wrong.

AFAIK it should work, but I haven't tested it myself. Thomas G.

Did you measure the actual power? Minimal wakeups is not the ultimate goal,
the ultimate goal is to save power. Minimal wakeups is just a measure to that
