Subject: [PATCH] libata: don't whine if ->prereset() returns -ENOENT
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

->prereset() returns -ENOENT to tell libata that the port is empty and
reset sequencing should be stopped.  This is not an error condition.
Update ata_eh_reset() such that it sets device classes to ATA_DEV_NONE
and return success in on -ENOENT.  This makes spurious error message
go away.

This should do it and better fits the intention of the return value.
Two things to note.
1. I think these ports should be made dummy instead of returning
-ENOENT on prereset().  -ENOENT from prereset() was a hack to keep
ata_piix's behavior unchanged while converting it to new EH.  If no
one objcts, I'll convert similar usages to use dummy ports after new
init model and drop -ENOENT hack in #upstream.
2. -ENODEV sounds more appropriate.  Why have I used -ENOENT.  :-)
Thanks.
