Dunno.  fwiw, we decided to _not_ embed KM_USER0 in the callee: we have had
some pretty ghastly bugs in the past due to misuse of kmap slots so the
idea was to shove the decision into the caller's face, make them think
about what they're doing

For some reason we've always done the flush_dcache_page() while holding the
kmap.  There's no reason for doing it this way and it just serves to worsen
scheduling latency a tiny bit.
