You also depend on your recent change to call __unhash_process
under the sighand lock.  Since the ->tgrp is protected by
the sighand lock.

Is there a reason for this?  I think at least proc could easily
take advantage of an rcu safe implementation.
Hmm.  At the moment proc is only taking the tasklist_lock during
traversal so we may have a problem with the list_add anyway.
Also could we name the member not ->tgrp but ->threads?
I keep half expecting tgrp to be a number, and have a hard
time not mispelling it tpgrp.

Agreed.
