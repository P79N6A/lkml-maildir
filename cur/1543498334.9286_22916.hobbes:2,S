	The only problem here is, how do you detect when a user attempts
to access a device node that doesn't currently exist?  Yes, you could
just have all of them already there, but then you're back to thousands
of files in /dev...  Although I personally do like the idea of having
subdirectories under /dev for things that make sense...
