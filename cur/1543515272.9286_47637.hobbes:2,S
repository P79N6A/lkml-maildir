Not a very accurate way of measuring.
Might I suggest:
     volatile int dummy1, dummy2;
     int	loop;
     dummy2 = rand();
     gettimeofday(&tv1, 0);
     for (loop = 500000; loop >0 ; loop--) {
         dummy1 = dummy2 + 10;
     }
     gettimeofday(&tv2, 0);
     gettimeofday(&tv3, 0);
     for (loop = 500000; loop >0; loop--) {
	   dummy1 = dummy2 + 10;
         statement_to_be_timed;
     }
     gettimeofday(&tv4, 0);
This gets you a longer run time, minimizing errors in clock accuracy, and
allows you to subtract the (admittedly extremely limited) loop overhead.
Provided that the statement under measurement doesn't exceed the size of L1
cache, the results should give you a fair estimate of the time required to
execute it.
Not that lval1 and lval2 must be marked volatile in order to prevent
optimization from eliminating them. It is still possible for the optimizer
to inline all the statements, but hopefully it will realize that is worse
because of cache effects than just running the loop.
If the statement does exceed the size of L1 cache, your probably better off
just putting it in the loop and measuring. The time to execute the loop will
be totally overwhelmed by the time executing your statement.
You would have to flush cache inside the loop in order to determine how long
an uncached call takes.
