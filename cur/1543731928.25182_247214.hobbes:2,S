I don't think this is the main issue. We are not talking about slight 
rounding errors that might (and in many places are) be accounted for,
but with real inconsistencies that arise whenever the system clock is
adjusted. This e.g. was the source of the 15 minutes error that I saw in 
my recent testing.
