But it does show the "Disabling VIA Write Queue" during boot, yes?  If
not, then maybe it /does/ need to be added.  If it does, then try
commenting all but one of the device lines and see which one is causing
your system to run the fixup.  Then you can try commenting /it/ out, and
see if the screen corruption goes away.  Additionally, you could change
the "v &= 0x1f;" to "v &= 0x7f;" on line 1209 to only clear bit 7.
Let me know how that goes.
