Whether git uses the client/server model or not does not matter; what matters 
is that there are two distinct use-cases at work here:  one on the 
server/repository, and the other on the client.

Again, this only handles the interface to/from the server/repository, but 
once you pulled the sources, it leaves you without Version Control on the 
client.
By pulling the sources into a git-client manager mounted on some dir, it 
should be possible to let the developer work naturally/transparently in a 
readable/writeable manner, and only require his input when reverting locally 
or committing to the server/repository.
Thanks!
