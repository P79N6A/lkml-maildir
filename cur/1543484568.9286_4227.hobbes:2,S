In what respect - the actual messages would be useful here. 
What should occur is 
default:	All processes using the nfs server, stating it even (eg DF)
		hang until it returns then recover once they notice
intr:		As above but ^C gets you out if its not masked
soft:		After a while they get -EIO and give up.
umount -f (with the newer tools) works on all of the three. You may need to
kill -9 all the processes in question then try it 2 or 3 times to unjam 
everything.
