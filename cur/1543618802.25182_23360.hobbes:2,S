Subject: Panic on boot with 2.4.18pre3ac1

About every second time I try to boot 2.4.18pre3ac1, the kernel panics
while trying to detect the SCSI hardware.  There's lots of debugging output
which I have't copied to paper, but there's the following messages:
Scratch or SCB Memory Parity Error
[...]
Attempting to queue an ABORT message
[...]
Kernel panic: Loop 1
This did not happen with earlier kernels (I've been using 2.4.10ac10 mostly,
but 2.4.15 didn't seem to have the problem either).
