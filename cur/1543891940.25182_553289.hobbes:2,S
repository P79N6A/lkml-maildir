Provided you won't be running an application which will require all
the memory, I've found 256MB swap on small (1GB mem) and larger (8GB)
servers to be adequate, but this clearly depends on what you're
running.
The idea would be to allow linux to swap out cold pages which are
(almost) never accessed while runaway processes get selected by the
OOM killer sooner. You may find 512MB to be more useful on large
untuned servers with lots of processes perhaps.
