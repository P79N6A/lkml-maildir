If you don't mind, can you please try patch attached now? I have now
also rolled back that cpu_to_le16() change as Satyam suggested. I see
no other reason for this perf. loss as I made no other change!
Also, can you please verify if you are comparing your _safe_ version
with this patch? This patch does not include unsafe version and the
safe one is simply called lzo1x_decompress().

I love this cleaned-up patch just sooo much! :)
Anyhow, if we can spend just small time scanning through these ~500
LOC to find reasons for any perf. loss, we will gain a lot!
Thanks,
