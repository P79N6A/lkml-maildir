Well, it's my opinion that using "size_t" is correct usage of type in
this case.  So here's my thinking:
* we leave lib/crc32c() as it is with size_t, as it is meant to be
derived from crc32() and that uses size_t.
* crypto/crc32c is a wrapper for lib/crc32c.  The interface it
presents to the rest of the crypto routines should agree.  My bad.
So, let us let it translate with a cast, as in the patch below.
