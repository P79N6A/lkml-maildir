However, I saw this in the patch:
+               /* determine if physical DMA addr spans 64K boundary.
+                * Note h/w doesn't support 64-bit, so we unconditionally
+                * truncate dma_addr_t to u32.
+                */
+               addr = (u32) sg_dma_address(sg);
Does it mean that I can't upgrade my machine to 4 GB or more
without losing NCQ or risking data corruption?
Can the code be made IOMMU-aware?
Best regards,
