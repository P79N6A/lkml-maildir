Sorry about the question to do with visuall gcc. Alot of people seemed to
get a intolerable response to my question. The reason I posted it here was
a) I am lazy, b) On all the sites to do with Kdevelop the download links are
down, and c) I wanted to use the program to compile such files as schedule.c
and other scheduling algorithms I create. What do most of you use to comile
the kernel, just good ole' command line gcc.
