Hello.
I have a "Terratec Cinergy HT PCI" tuner which works perfectly with
2.6.21 kernel.
With 2.6.22 kernel it doesn't tune specific stations while it tunes
others fine.
I browsed the lkml from 13/05 (date the 2.6.22-rc1 was released) but
haven't found
anything similar nor in google. I have also tried 2.6.23-rc1 to see if
its fixed.

the .config was copied from 2.6.21 -> 2.6.22 -> 2.6.23-rc1 and no
option regarding
the media/video was changed.
the behaviour is the same with xdtv and tvtime programs.
I have the following channels stored:
UHF 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 39, 43, 51, 54, 62, 65
With 2.6.21 every station works fine.
With 2.6.22+ i get the following behavior:
23, 25, 26, 39, 43, 51, 54 work fine while
24, 27, 62, 65 have sound but no video.
The channels that don't work aren't small channels with low signal
quality, they have
the same quality with those that work, so i guess its not something
about antenna quality.
Has anyone the same problem ?
If you need any more info, please tell me.

Thank you for your time.
