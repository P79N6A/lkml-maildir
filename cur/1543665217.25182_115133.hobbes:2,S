Actually, it's the MIT license, which differs from the (new) BSD license
only in the no-endorsement clause, which seemed superfluous.
It was chosen because klibc is a non-dynamic library, and it would
otherwise be extremely awkward to link proprietary code against it if
someone would like to do so.  Furthermore, I'm the author of most of the
code in there, and if someone really wants to rip it off it's not a huge
deal to me.
