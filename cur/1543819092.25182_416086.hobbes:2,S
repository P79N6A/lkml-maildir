The change in question is:

I agree with the latter part of this but not the change for the "if (p >
total_size)" case. If we return zero here, the writer will just keep
retrying to write to the device indefinitely and therefore hang. Would
it make sense to revert that part of the change?:
If we reach the end of the framebuffer, we should return an out of space
error, not zero. Returning zero implies we might be able to write
further bytes at some future time which isn't true.
