I don't know how this works today, but historically Linux has been
completely unable to deal with any kind of names in /etc/exports.
Netgroups, DNS names, ...  And the results have been the strangest mix
of things sort-of-mostly-but-not-quite working.
I'd put in IP addresses, netmasks or '*', and see if that solves the
problem.
Again, I don't know if this is related to what you're seeing, but I'd
say it's worth a shot :)
