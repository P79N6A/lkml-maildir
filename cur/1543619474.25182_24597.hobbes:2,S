No need to use a modified kernel; plain old 2.4.18 or so should do
fine, it supports the rtsig stuff.  But yeah, you may want to
see if the core of ircd can be recoded.  Can you give me the URL
for the source of the version you use?  I can peek at it.
It only took me two days to recode betaftpd to use Poller...
I do know that the guys working on aio for linux say they
have code that will make poll() much more efficient, so
I suppose another option is to join the linux-aio list and
say "So you folks say you can make plain old poll() more efficient, eh?
Here's a test case for you." :-)
