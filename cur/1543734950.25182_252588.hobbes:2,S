> Old behaviour (modprobe "waits" for the creation of device):
I wonder if it would be feasible for modprobe (or some other utility) to
have a new option: --wait-for=/dev/something which would wait for the
device node to appear. Perhaps by:
	- some mechanism based on HAL, DBUS, whatever
	- dnotify on /dev/?
	- falling back to spinning and waiting.
The first two sound nice since they avoid spinning and sleeping for a
second at a time, which just adds to the delay.
In addition a timeout of some sort to give an upper bound would seem
like a good idea.
Ian.
