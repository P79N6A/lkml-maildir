It depends on what the patch ends up looking like I guess.
All those games with PG_fs_misc look awfully similar to lock_page() - I'd
have thought there's some room for rationalising code in there.
The overall approach would be to avoid adding overhead and complexity for
other filesystems and to only export symbols which constitute a sensible
API: avoid exporting weirdo internal helpers which we might change in the
future (but we don't care about external modules, so why does this matter? 
Because some of them are GPL?)
