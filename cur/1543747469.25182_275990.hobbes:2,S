So far so good.
I have now an armed RT-V0.31-19 on my laptop, running for about 30 minutes
already, running the usual 'jackd -R -dalsa -dhw:0 -r44100 -p64 -n2 -S -P'
from qjackctl, several qsynth (fluidsynth) engines are up and running,
normal desktop janitor work (KDE) and yes, ACPI is on. Oh, wi-fi is also
pumping nice :)
Guess what? No XRUNs, not even one to show you a single latency trace.
I'll keep you posted, if anything goes less right than it is :).
