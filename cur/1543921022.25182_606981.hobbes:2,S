I agree with Christoph - the fact that *all* architectures have to be
either ptrace or utrace make it very very painful.
What would be good is if some effort could be made by the utrace-
interested parties to make the transition to utrace much less painful.
For instance, I quite like the getregs/setregs abstractions, and it
looks like these *could* be self-contained in a single patch.  It
would be nice if we could move architectures over to this one a time.
Once that's in, that's one chunk of utrace merged.
