The right answer is that oom-adj scores are global, while it is required
in some cases to have local groups processes can be arranged into so
that local tunables could be used. cpusets just happend to be those
groups, while it could be in turn wider cgroups with the proposed
or similar patch.
Or those groups could be processes started with special name :)
It just happend that cpusets were the first, so you can say,
that they are so special, while actually they are not.
We already have this, and history does not tolerate conjunctives,
so let's drop this part :)

Is this double standards, since your proposal, if implemented a
little bit different, does not solve the problem at all. And you argue
that uncomplete solution should not be merged. Please note, that I do
not object against notifications, but just want to have a system which
will work in all cases or at least in the majority of them.

This reminds me a thread, where modporbe stuck because initrd code is
actually not allowed to write something to the console, and while it
happend that bug is somewhere else, the same argument was rised about
such fun limitations. What about just asking userspace developers not to
write a code, which may lead to OOM conditions :)
Even not arguing 'sane implementation' case, what about process which
happend to be in swap? Its oom handler has to be locked in the memory to
be sucessfully invoked, but this does not work if all allowed to be
locked memory is used.

Seems like you just do not read what I wrote. Please do. At least the
last sentence :) And what I wrote about swapped and locked memory.

I actually did not tell anything about task scheduling.
I said that in the case above, if oom-killer would depend on the
userspace it could not make a progress, since oom-handlers would
not be able to wake up if swapped, and in this case oom-killer
would need just to select one by its own hueristics.

How cute :)
Any other technical arguments of the same strength?
