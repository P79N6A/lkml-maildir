There are specific rules against removal of technical measures *even if
the result is legal*. It is an offence in many countries thanks to the
RIAA lobbyists and their corrupt pet politicians to remove technical
measures applied to a -public domain- work.
So your argument doesn't fly.

Consider it an education process. Hopefully the contracts for the
chips/docs were watertight enough you can sue the offending supplier for
the total cost of the rework. If not then you are really complaining
about getting contract negotiations wrong.

I doubt any distribution but the FSF "purified" Debian (the one that has
no firmware so doesn't work) would do it.
