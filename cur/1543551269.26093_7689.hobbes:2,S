Hmm. Your C/H/S multiplies out to 9.1 GB.
On the other hand, Seagate ST39102LW has 9105018880 bytes,
so probably the 8 was a typo (and you are wasting 7859200 bytes).

A SCSI one, not a Unix one.
But you omit the interesting part.
SCSI drivers tend to give a reason, say timeout, or medium error, whatever.
What was the precise error message?
In such cases what fdisk or fsck or so say is hardly of any interest.
One wants the kernel messages. Literally.

Yes, Linux SCSI error recovery behaviour is not a pleasure to behold.
Some aspects of it are better in 2.4, however.
