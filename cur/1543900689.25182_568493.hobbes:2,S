Imagine you're working on a piece of kernel code that has a lot of parallel 
churn. Conflicts on lines like "int a,b,c,d;" are more likely to cause Andrew 
et al pain, which I guess is the rationale for discouraging it. Conversely, 
if the variables are kept separate, diff handles it fine.
I think as long as the variables are logically grouped, the pain is minimised, 
but there's a few good reasons for the verbose style.
