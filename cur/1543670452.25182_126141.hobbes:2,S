It does not help me with 2.5.67-ac2 + pcmcia patch. I get 0.000 MHz,
589.82 BogoMIPS with or without CPUFreq. It did the same thing with
2.5.67-ac1 (did not test w/o CPUFreq).
The box is 600 MHz PIII (Coppermine) in Dell Inspiron 5000. On the plus
side I kind of like the # of insns per clock cycle ;-)
As Jeff said it's almost OK otherwise; it hangs on boot without the
pcmcia patch and I saw USB Storage oopses.
