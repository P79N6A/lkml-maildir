no, this is about the mainline kernel turning off hardirqs for a long 
time. (i used the hardirqs-off terminology instead of irqs-off to 
differentiate it from softirqs-off a'ka local_bh_disable(). It's a 
side-effect of working on the lock validator i guess ;).

rwsems/rwlocks are not an issue in -rt because they have different 
semantics there - and thus readers cannot amass. I do think rwsems and 
rwlocks have pretty nasty characteristics [non-latency ones] for the 
mainline kernel's use too, but that's not being argued here ;)
