You have to drag "mod->name" out of kallsyms_lookup(), so if you drop
module_mutex in it, you still have a bug.
We can agree on kallsyms_lookup() or whatever other low-level function
to copy everything into caller-supplied structure and not spreading
module_mutex. module's name is 64 minus a little, so stack usage should
be fine.

Well, yes.

Yeah, I remembered about it only in subway :).
This patch is techically dependent on

 aka
[PATCH v2] Race between cat /proc/kallsyms and rmmod

OK, I'll fix it.
