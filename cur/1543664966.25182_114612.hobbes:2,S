ok, i see what you are saying now.  since this is used to move the
stuff queued from the old connection to the new connection i suppose
clip might want something like?
	spin_lock_bh(&vcc->recvq.lock)
        skb_migrate(&vcc->recvq,&copy);
	spin_unlock_bh(&vcc->recvq.lock);
that would block any more additions to the recvq (which should be
sk->receieve_queue i suspect -- more on that later) while the skb are
moved to copy.  i am afraid i dont know much about how the clip driver
operates.
