Hi,
I wanted to get info about my NIC via ethtool, but it writes:
# ethtool eth0
Cannot get device settings: Operation not supported
# ethtool eth1
Cannot get device settings: Operation not supported
00:11.0 Ethernet controller: 3Com Corporation 3c905B 100BaseTX [Cyclone] (rev 
30)
01:08.0 Ethernet controller: 3Com Corporation 3c905 100BaseTX [Boomerang]
Any possibility to add this support into this driver?
kernel 2.4.26-vanilla
Debian Woody
Thanks
Michal
