hi all
I'm sorry to repost this - I just need some sort of fix, or perhaps try
another OS, like a BSD or something
On my computer, I've set up a 2-disk stripe set (RAID-0). Each disk has
some 120GB disk space, and is pretty fast. Each disk can do some 40 megs
per second disk-to-memory.
However, when reading multiple, large files (3 gigs each) simultanously,
vmstat first shows quite high throughput (~ 40-50 megs per sec). But as I
reach the point where I've filled the cache, speed is reduced to 1-2 megs
per sec.
I'm running 2.4.16 with the latest tux patches plus Andrea's IDE patch.
I'm positive that this is not a tux problem. I've also tried 2.4.17-rc1,
but all I got out of that was some 20-30% slower I/O.
Hardware:
Athlon 1133MHz
1GB RAM (highmem disabled in kernel)
1x20 gig disk for root partition
2x120 gig disks in RAID-0 (chunk size = 4096) for data partition
Please help me out here...
Regards
roy
