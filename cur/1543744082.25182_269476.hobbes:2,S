Pre alloc_pages / kswapd shakeup, the watermark stuff had been pretty
broken. For example, allocations would wakeup kswapd at the *same*
watermark as they would start synchronous reclaim (or fail in the case
of !wait allocations).
Why there have been apparently more reports of allocation failures
since those patches is a mystery to me. I've looked but can't find
anything to explain it. Perhaps the initial watermark calculation had
been changed slightly? I'm not sure... it could also be just be a fluke
due to chaotic effects in the mm, I suppose :|
