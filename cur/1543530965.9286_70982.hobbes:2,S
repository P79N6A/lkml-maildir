Yes, if you are out of memory, something dies as a result. It's too
late to avoid that by the time the OOM killer kicks in protecting more
important processes.

Touching the pages disables overcommit in itself.

Nor will it protect you from kill -9 or any other "You are hogging
resources, so ... off" measure. Only using the right system for the
job (i.e. one with the resources you need) will avoid problems.

Yes it will. You can still run out of memory. In fact, you will do so
sooner without overcommit.
