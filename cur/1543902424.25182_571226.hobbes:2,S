Hotplug is user-controllable, so if the user refrains from adding pci
devices after assigning a device to the guest, it should work.  I think
that USB interrupts are assigned to the controller, not the device, so
USB hotplug can be ruled out.
I admit this is fairly weak.

Oh, I've no doubt it will be made to work -- there's money to be saved
in those irq lines.  And msi makes sense technically as well.
