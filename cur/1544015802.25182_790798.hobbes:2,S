md5 support of course belongs in crypto/md5.c in a perfect world
The fs/cifs/md5.c code (and cifs/md4.c for that matter) is very
generic md5 code, nothing much cifs specific although it would be
worth looking at whether there are endian issues.
CIFS uses md5 in two places, calculating an hmac in fs/cifs/md5.c and
then in calculating packet signatures on SMB/CIFS packets.  CIFS usage
of md5 is really simple (see below), basically we run MD5 on an
SMB/CIFS packet passing in the length (and the key) to calculate a 20
byte signature (which is sent to the server on requests, and we
calculate the expected signature to verify that responses from the
server have not been tampered with).   When we last checked on this
with the crypto guys, it would take a lot more code to do this using
the common crypto routines since they were setup to handle more
complex use cases.
static int cifs_calculate_signature(const struct smb_hdr *cifs_pdu,
                                    const struct mac_key *key, char *signature)
{
        struct  MD5Context context;
...
        MD5Init(&context);
        MD5Update(&context, (char *)&key->data, key->len);
        MD5Update(&context, cifs_pdu->Protocol /* beginning of packet
*/, cifs_pdu->smb_buf_length);
        MD5Final(signature, &context);
        return 0;
}
