ok, i fixed the -ERESTART_RESTARTBLOCK bug that fast systems were 
exhibiting. But this bug is limited to HIGH_RES_TIMERS kernels, so it 
cannot explain your problems i think.
in any case, could you try the -rc4-rt3 patch i just uploaded - it also 
includes more ktimer debugging code, perhaps one of them triggers on 
your box.
