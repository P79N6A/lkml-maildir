Right.

But these three are generally not good examples. You want to cache stuff
unless it is huge. E.g. doing grep over and over on a kernel tree is quite
frequent, if you have enough memory, then you finish with having entire
source tree in the cache after the first run.
So such hints should be given only if the applications either know the
transfered amounts are huge, or they can be sure nobody will use it again
soon. The generic apps you listed don't know anything about the data.
Cheers,
