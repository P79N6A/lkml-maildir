Fabio,
i noticed another RFC anomaly in X15. It ignores the "Connection: close"
request header passed by a HTTP/1.1 client. This behavior is against RFC
2616, a server must not override the client's choice of non-persistent
connection. (there might be HTTP/1.1 clients that do not support
persistent connections and signal this via "Connection: close".)
the rule is this: a request is either keepalive or non-keepalive. HTTP/1.0
requests default to non-keepalive. HTTP/1.1 requests default to keepalive.
The default can be overriden via the "Connection: Keep-Alive" or
"Connection: close" header fields.
if you fix this, does it impact SPECweb99 performance in any way?
	Ingo
