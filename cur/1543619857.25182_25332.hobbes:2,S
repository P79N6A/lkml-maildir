It's a regular AT keyboard... no, there are no kernel log messages 
dumped to the screen and I highly doubt any captured to any file because 
the only way out is to power down the system.  Searching kern.log, all I 
see is hotplug add NAME=AT commands, which is nothing unusual.  This 
"losing" only seems to happen after 2.5.2-dj6 (did not try -dj7).
But even 2.5.2-dj6 will lose my mouse... or rather, it will never see it 
to begin with.  It's a regular, bland, boring PS/2 mouse.
