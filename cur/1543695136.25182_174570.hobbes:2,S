Uh, not moving jiffies?  What does this say about any timers that may be 
pending?  Say for cron or some such?  Like I said, I picked up this thread a bit 
late, but, seems to me that if time is passing, it should pass on both the 
jiffies AND the wall clocks.

The spec thing would relate to any sleeps or timers that are pending.  The spec 
would seem to say they should complete somewhere near the requested wall time, 
but NEVER before.  By not moving jiffies, I think they will be a bit late.  Now, 
if they were to complete during the sleep, well those should fire at completion 
of the sleep.  If the are to complete after the sleep, then, it seems to me, 
they should fire at the requested time.
