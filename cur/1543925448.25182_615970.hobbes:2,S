Although you can address up to 64GB of RAM with PAE, the address space
of directly accessible memory is still at 32bit (4GB) and access to
higher memory costs low memory and processing overhead for the mapping
into the 32bit address space.

kern.log has wrong permissions, slabinfo and meminfo are empty.
