Subject: (2.6.12) is there any reason for alarm() call to add 1 to the returned value?

I've:
Linux version 2.6.12-rc6
LSB_VERSION="1.3"
Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS release 4 (Nahant)
Gnu C    gcc (GCC)     3.4.3 20041212 (Red Hat 3.4.3-9.EL4)
Gnu make               3.80
util-linux             2.12a
mount                  2.12a
modutils               3.1-pre5
e2fsprogs              1.35
pcmcia-cs              3.2.7
PPP                    2.4.2
isdn4k-utils           3.3
Linux C Library        2.3.4
Dynamic linker (ldd)   2.3.4
this behavior is new:
        alarm() does not return the number of seconds  remaining  until  any
       previously  scheduled  alarm was due to be delivered
  but
         it returns (the number of seconds  remaining + 1)
(with 2.6.10 and previous, 1 was not added to the returned value)

-----------------------------------------------------------
result:
------
ret_val2 returned = 8
ret_val2 expected = 7
I'm interested knowing what is the expected behavior ...
many thanks,
