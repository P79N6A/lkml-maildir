I hope you're kidding... one of the reasons for going to 2.6 is that you 
no longer have to patch your kernel to get cryptoloop. That is a real 
issue in some organizations, which only allow vendor or kernel.org kernels.
If you start dropping features which work for most people but aren't 
perfect, you will wind up with a microkernel indeed.
