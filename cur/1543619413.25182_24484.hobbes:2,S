Running on a machine that I dont think I can really officially give numbers..
However, lets say that without the tuneable code you got a run of hackbench
doing 60 groups that took 8.27 secs, when the tuneable code is in it went
to a whopping 8.6 secs :)
The results at least on this benchmark were all in that decimal noise.
As for a build option, if the code were integrated I might see that as 
making sense, but as this is a developmental patch the user is expected
to know what they are doing. Only root can write anything to the parameters
as well.
Cheers,
