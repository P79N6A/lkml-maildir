Subject: Can't See CDR-W After Compile ??

I have compiled my first kernel (2.4.10) and all has
gone well except I now can't access the CDR-W.
I have included SCSI Support and included what I think
may need to be loaded as well.
I see it as an IDE drive but has no SCSI-Emulation.
I have had a look through DMESG to get an idea what's
happening, and I see the message:
 "request_module[scsi_hostadapter]: Root fs not
mounted"
What have I left out ?
Pete
