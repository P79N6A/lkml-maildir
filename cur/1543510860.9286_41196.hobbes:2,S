Hi all!
	Ok, I know that this has been discussed to death. But I need to find
some info that I know exists on this list.
	I have a Linux server that is serving NFS to Solaris 7 x86 clients. As
you all know there are problems with the "stock" kernel in doing that. 
	All of the discussion I've found on this topic seems to be about doing
the reverse: Mounting NFS filesystems "from" a Solaris server "TO" a
Linux client. There was even mention of a patch to the Linux kernel to
resolve this.
	But I can't find anything about doing this with the Linux box as the
server, and the Solaris box as the client. 
	Does anyone know of a patch, or a package to resolve this problem.
Under Redhat 6.0 on my Alpha server, and Solaris 7 x86, I cannot even do
mounts. I just get errors in /var/log/messages about v3 not being
recognized.
	I'm running an Alpha on RedHat 6.0 with kernel 2.2.12
	The client is a Solaris 7 x86.
	Can anyone help?  It would be greatly appreciated.
		Thanks in advance.
PS: I searched the archives a couple of weeks ago. and did not find an
answer. Which is why I brought this to this list.
		Thanks again!
