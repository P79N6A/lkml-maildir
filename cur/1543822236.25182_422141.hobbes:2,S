So... what are the consumers of this data going to be? That is my question.

My suggestion is basically this: if the accounting is going to be used
infrequently, it might be a good idea to allocate the accounting structures
on demand, and only perform the accounting when these structures are
allocated.
It all adds up. Extra cache misses, more icache, more logic, etc... I 
suspect
that relatively few people will care about these stats.
