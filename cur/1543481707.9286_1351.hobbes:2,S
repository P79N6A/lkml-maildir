Hi all,
I think I've just about finished the draft for the press release. It is
available from <
http://www.tip.net.au/~edlang/linux/linux2.2pr.html>.
 Kyle
Rose has also been editing a draft, available from
<
http://bigred.lcs.mit.edu/~krose/linux2.2.0pr-f1.html>.
 I urge people to look
at both versions, and then Linus can choose.
Translators: Please translate both versions of the press release. This way we
can simply choose which one to use.
Bye for now,
