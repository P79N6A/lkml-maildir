Hi,
[version 004]
'patchview' merges a patch file and a source tree to a set of
temporary modified files.  This enables better patch (re)viewing
and more viewable context.  (hopefully)
The patchview script is here:
  
http://www.xenotime.net/linux/scripts/patchview
usage: patchview [-f] [-s] patchfile srctree {ver. 004}
  -f : force tkdiff even if 'patch' has errors
  -s : single tkdiff even if patchfile contains multiple files
It uses (requires) lsdiff (from patchutils) and
tkdiff or mtkdiff (multi-file tkdiff viewer).
'mtkdiff' is used if it is found and is executable.
(and it's pretty cool)
patchutils:  
http://cyberelk.net/tim/patchutils/
tkdiff:      
http://sourceforge.net/projects/tkdiff/
mtkdiff:     
http://home-tj.org/mtkdiff/files/

* Kill the viewers when the script is killed.
* Un-hardcode PROG.
* Add [-s] to usage message.
