Given that it takes about 8 to 12 hours to do a build cycle, that's
not practical.  The only real solution is for us to accept that
breakage will occur (and be prepared to keep a steady stream of
fixes heading into Linus' tree - which has been ruled out by Linus)
or J. Random Developer has to build a set of affected ARM defconfigs
themselves.
Or alternatively the guy who's running kautobuild needs an amount of
rather powerful donated hardware to stubstantially increase it's
throughput.
Or cross-gcc needs to be optimised to compile faster.
I don't see any of the above happening, so...
