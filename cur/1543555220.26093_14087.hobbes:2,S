Subject: Promise Ultra66 boot troubles (lost interrupt and waiting for DMA timeout)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

I just installed a Promise Ultra66 in my computer.  It is running kernel 
2.2.17 with the unified ide patch (20001118) from Andre Hedrick.  When I 
boot the machine with drives plugged into this device the machine will hang 
during the partition check of the first drive connected to this controller. 
The error is
	hdf:hdf lost interrupt
	hdf: lost interrupt
	Waiting for DMA timeout
It will sit at that state for at least 10 minutes.  The machine will boot 
properly with no drives connected to the controller.  Part of the output 
from dmesg is included.
  Any suggestions?  I can of course provide further info and details if 
needed or desired.
