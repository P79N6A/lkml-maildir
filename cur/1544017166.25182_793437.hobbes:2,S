btw., that's a nice fix - were you able to reproduce any of the lockdep 
asserts that i got in testing, and did those go away with this patch?
If yes then that's nice and makes work_on_cpu() a lot more usable IMO.
If not then that should generally be declared in the pull request: 
"beware, different approach than before but might still trigger lockdep 
warnings".
