Just for the record - I don't think Acorn disks can have sectors
bigger than 1k.  (I never managed to get the 640Mb MO discs working, I
had to get the 512 byte sectored 512 Mb ones instead.)  I just checked
in the PRM and it agrees with my very rusty memory.
I have some acorn partitioned MO discs lying around if you want to see
the first few sectors off the disc...
