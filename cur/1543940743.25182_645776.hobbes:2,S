The GPL might only talk about distribution.
But copyright law is not restricted to copying of work.
IANAL, and I don't know abou the laws in other countries, but at least 
in Germany modifications of a copyrighted work require the permission of 
the copyright holder.
It's e.g. a not so uncommon problem that someone wants to modify a 30 or 
80 years old building, and since the original contract with the 
architect did not grant the owner of the building the rights to modify 
it he needs to ask the architect (or the architect's heirs) who has the 
(nontransferable) copyright on the building for the permission to modify 
the building. [1]

Look at what Geert quoted in this thread as opinion of actual lawyers.

[1] The building must be above the threshold of originality for giving 
    the architect a copyright and there are other laws that might  
    force the copyright holder to allow some modifications.
