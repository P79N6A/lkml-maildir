Yeah. I tuned the gettimeofday function on IA64 to be faster than the
glibc's use of the ITC but there are still some voices that demand a memory mapped
timer.

A division can always be avoided. This is the equation
nanoseconds = x / y * timer_value
where x/y = scaling factor
and one can always set Y = 2^py to substitute a shift instead of
doing division. Just scale  x also appropriately by 2^px. This works to an
arbitrary accuracy if one has a long enough integer type. That is why I
suggested at least the intermediate use of 128bit. 64bit is fine for the
current cases but I would expect a need for 128bit to arise in the
future.
Math is sometimes simple and may simplify a lot of things.

I have not encountered a case that could not be handled by the above
mentioned transformation. Mathematically I would think I could say it is
impossible to find such a case.

I would rather have only one (the read timer function) and that function
would be optional for non-well-behaved timer sources.

These are all good reasons for centralizing the functionality instead of
dispersing it in many functions.
