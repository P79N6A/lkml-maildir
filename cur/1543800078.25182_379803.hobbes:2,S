Well, the runqueue structure is the "easy" part of it. And load balancing
should not be changed at all[*] by any of these things because we are talking
about a per-CPU runqueue model.
[*] Apart from obvious and really hard to analyse things like which task is
     actually running at a point in time, and changing the cache-hotness of
     things...

OK maybe it isn't as large scale a change as one of the rewrites, however
it still is going to probably wildly change behaviour of situations outside
the little box you analysed and found it to be an improvement for.
But points to you for experimenting and trying new things. Don't let me
put you off because I'm not much of an expert on ingosched so it may not
be as large a change as I'm making it out to be.
