   Well, other filesystems than ext2 are much better suited for removable
   media (minixfs for example). I hardly know anyone using ext2 on removable
   media *and* exchanging software with people using other
   platforms. :-)
There really isn't a problem using ext2 for removeable media, unless
it's a portability concern (in which case using vfat is a better choice
than minixfs).  The one issue with using ext2 for smaller disks that by
default mke2fs creates a filesystem fairly large inode table, and on a
1.44 meg floppy the overhead is pretty noticeable.  This can be
addressed using the the -i option to mke2fs.  A larger number passed to
-i will decrease the number of inodes created; the default value is
4096, which means there will be enough inodes created for if the
average file size is 4k.
