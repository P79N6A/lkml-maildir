Currently monotonic_clock()is only used by the hangcheck-timer, and is
not used by gettimeofday/clock_gettime (even w/ CLOCK_MONOTONIC). 
So there may still be an issue there w/ the hangcheck-timer(for x86-64,
on i386 the acpi pm timer can be used for monotonic_clock), but its
doesn't affect the time related userland interfaces.
