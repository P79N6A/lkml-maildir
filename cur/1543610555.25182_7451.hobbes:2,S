Hi
As fair as I know 2.4.15 has a bug which will destroy your filesystem by
and by when unmounting it. So why does nobody rename the file to
linux-2.4.15-broken.tar.bz2 or linux-2.4.15-dontuse.tar.bz2. If we don't
more and more people will download the file and destroy their
filesystems. Correct me, if I am wrong, but I think that is the best we
could do.
