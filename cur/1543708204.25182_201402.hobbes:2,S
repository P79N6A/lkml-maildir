Nothing is going to help with that EIP with a segment value of
0x60. It looks like some dumb coding error, using a pointer
that disappeared after the module init function. In other
words, it's probably something like:
int __init init_module()
{
    struct file_operations fops;
    mset(&fops, 0x00, sizeof(fops));
    fops.open = open;
    fops.release = close;
    fops.owner = THIS_MODULE;
    register_chrdev(DEV_MAJOR, dev, &fops);
}
So, everything in init_module is GONE. Your program calls open()
and the pointer in the kernel gets dereferenced to junk.
There are kernel debugging tools, however I have found that
the most useful tools are printk() and some discipline.
In the case of code above, don't just change the declaration
of the fops object to static. Instead, move it outside the
function, so it's obviously where it won't go away.
Cheers,
