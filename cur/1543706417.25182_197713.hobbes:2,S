What's unpredictable about it?  udev can apply exactly the same rules 
that devfs uses, thereby coming up with the same names.  In that limited 
case, the advantage to udev is to move code out of the kernel.  Not only 
does that shrink the kernel, but it moves policy that affects user space 
into user space.
If udev had a "devfs" mode where it used a ramdisk for device nodes, and 
it produced exactly the same names as devfs, would you be happy with it?
Any device node you needed would have been generated well before you 
needed it, and being a filesystem node, it's no slower to actually USE 
the device than devfs, and you'd get all the same behavior you had 
before.  The ONLY difference is that the code isn't in the kernel.
You have the further advantage, for the embedded people, that you can 
eliminate udev, and create static device nodes, without having to modify 
the kernel in any way.
For the typical case, udev COULD produce the same device names as devfs, 
completely addressing your "predictability" issue.  It would be 
PERFECTLY predictable.  But it has the additional advantage of being 
able to keep a database in a file that it uses to also make device names 
CONSISTENT.  Thus, if you attach a USB device and then remove it and 
then attach it again later, udev has a simple way to compare that device 
against its history of known devices and give that device again exactly 
the same name.  Can devfs do that?  If so, where does it keep its history?

How does devfs save space?  Device node information has to be stores 
SOMEWHERE.  Whether that's in filesystem nodes or in datastructures in 
the kernel that are dynamically made to LOOK like device nodes, you 
still need to take up memory.
As for dynamic major/minor numbers, I'm not sure how udev precludes 
that.  The fact that udev might keep minor numbers from changing over a 
reboot doesn't matter.  Dynamic major/minor numbers just means that they 
can be arbitrary.
