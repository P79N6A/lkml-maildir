Use kmap_atomic().
Move the flush_dcache_page() into here.

err, this seems like an easy way for people to make the kernel go BUG.

This doesn't help.  The reason we've avoided file-to-file sendfile() is
that it can cause applications to get uninterruptibly stuck in the kernel
for ages.  This code doesn't solve that problem.  It needs to handle
signal_pending() inside the main loop.
And it probably needs to return a sane value (number of bytes copied)
rather than -EINTR.
I don't know if we want to add this feature, really.  It's such a
specialised thing.
