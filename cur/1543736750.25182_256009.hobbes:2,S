This doesn't seem right.  generic_shutdown_super is only called when the
last instance of a super is released.  If a system were to have a
filesystem mounted in two locations (for instance, by creating a new
namespace), then the umount and ignore would not get propagated when one
is unmounted.
How about an approach that somehow referenced vfsmounts (without having
a reference count proper)?  That way you could queue messages in
umount_tree and do_umount..
