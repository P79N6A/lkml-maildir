You bring up a good point, but it's only the tip of the iceburg.
The boot code was changed to use GAS rather than AS86 assembler. I
don't know why. However, the resulting code is in may cases plain
wrong. I thought I would wait until somebody fixed GAS before I
looked at this stuff, but there is a problem requiring immediate
attention. The problem is that there doesn't seem to be any way
to tell GAS to assemble 16-bit, rather than 32-bit instructions.
It is _not_ just putting 'w' or 'l' after an instruction. To explain,
If I assemble code in 16-bit mode:
	mov	ax,bx	; Intel
	byte sequence is 0x89, 0xd8
If I am in 16-bit mode and want to assemble:
	mov	eax,ebx	; Intel
	byte sequence is 0x66, 0x89, 0xd8
If I am in 32-bit mode and want to assemble:
	mov	eax,ebx	; Intel
	byte sequence is 0x89, 0xd8 -- just like the 16-bit mov ax,bx
What has happened is that it looks as though source code was 'tweaked`
to get the correct binary from GAS. This makes the source-code wrong.
Cheers,
