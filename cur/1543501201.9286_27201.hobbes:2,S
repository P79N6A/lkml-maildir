No. In that case if you have machine with lusers and power users how will
you provide both groups with what they need? If you compile the stuff into
the kernel, power users lose, if not - lusers cry. And I will just repeat
what many said already in this thread - this is not a kernel stuff, it
belongs to the userland.

Shell is just an application like any other. If the functionality discussed
here is provided in a library, then a shell, as an interactive app, can use
its own means of turning the behavior on and off - just like any other app.

And which makes it very specific to just one file system. It's not generic
enough.
