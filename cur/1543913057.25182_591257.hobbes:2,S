Doesn't matter if the BSD license or the GPL *PERMITS* it or not. The fact 
remains that the person making a work available under *ANY* form of copyright 
license has the right to revoke said grant of license to anyone. The GPL 
codifies certain situations in which the person would not, personally, have 
to revoke the license, but does not limit the original copyright holders 
rights (in that regard) in any way.
The BSD/ISC license has none of the automatic conditions of the GPL, but it 
also cannot remove the copyright holder(s) from exercising their rights.
(And no, I haven't spoken to a lawyer about this - I did, however, ask a 
recently graduated law-school student where I could look for case-law and the 
text of the actual laws. What I got was some background on US copyright law 
itself and an agreement that a copyright license does not - and can not - 
affect the person holding the copyright)

Have done so. And that is the only part of the license that I actually don't 
like.

Agreed, and I've never claimed otherwise. (Nor has anyone else. I believe the 
closest that anyone has come was Alan Cox saying (and I'm going to paraphrase 
it because I don't think he ever stated it well) "If you've made changes to a 
file that carries a dual BSD/GPL license and your changes are GPL only, the 
file can no longer be distributed under the BSD license at all. So it is safe 
to remove the headers from that individual file."
There is no way that a license on a constituent file can alter or affect the 
license on the whole project (if it is different). It can "muddy the waters", 
but that is about as far as I can see it going.
(I realize I may have said different, originally, but you'll have to forgive 
me. I was not in the best of moods (or the best state of mind) to be making a 
completely rational argument when I did such.)
