Hmm, yes. I guess that was to fix a race with old do_nopage()?
Since GEM and similar managers are using  vm_insert_pfn, I guess that's 
not really needed.

No. It's a little odd ;), but we had a thorough discussion at that time 
(some two years ago) on LKML.
What strucks me now, though, is that if the struct address_space * 
differs between device nodes pointing to the same underlying device, we 
might be in trouble (Is that what started this thread from the first 
place?), and we might have to resort to keep track of all VMAs anyway...
