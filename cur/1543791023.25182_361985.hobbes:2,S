I realise swiotlb will have bad performance.  But with the revert, swiotlb
is not going to be used at all!!.  PCI_DMA_BUS_IS_PHYS is used by the block
subsystem to check if any kind of iommu (soft or hard) is available. If none
is present, block layer uses the ISA pool for bounce buffering bringing down 
performance.

But you have to use SATA disks to use AHCI right?.  IDE disks will work with 
32bit dma addresses only (please correct me if I am wrong).  And I belive 
there are 1U racks/blades out there with IDE disks on these server boards with 
more than 4G memory (I am told it saves them $$ to use IDE disks over SATA
when you deploy large numbers).
Whatever the reasons might be, IMHO, it is not correct to assume no one is 
going to use 32 bit capable only devices on 64bit boxes.  swiotlb code need 
not have been in the kernel otherwise.  This one line revert is just force 
turning off swiotlb on x86_64 boxes with no option whatsover :(

I agree it is ugly.  But it atleast shows and does what the comment says.
Is reverting a bug-fix to mask another bug (probably due to a broken bios or
user not setting the IOMMU in the bios) any cleaner?  Yes it doesn't show
though ;)
Seriously, are there plans to fix the broken AMD boxes for 2.6.15?  Will
swiotlb be forced off even for 2.6.15?  Linus, Andrew?
Thanks,
Kiran
