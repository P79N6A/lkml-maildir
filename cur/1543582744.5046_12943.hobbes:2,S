   I'll leave that up to somebody else - we now have two alternatives, the
   100%, no-compromise INCOMPAT solution, and the slightly-bruised but
   still largely intact forward compatible solution.  I'll maintain both
   solutions for now code so it's just as easy to choose either in the end.
Well, the $64,000 question is exactly how much performance does it cost?
My guess is that it will be barely measurable, but only benchmarks will
answer that question.
