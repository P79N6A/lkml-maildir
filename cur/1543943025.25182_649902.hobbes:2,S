Never seen it before in my life.  Can't find any references to it in any of
the mailing lists.  I ended up googling the changelog text for a whopping
three hits and it appears that this change went into the powerpc patch
system (
http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/linuxppc/patch?id=16712
)
How it got from there into Linux is also a mystery.  I see a batch of
powerpc updates just went into mainline but I don't know whose tree was
pulled - I wasn't copied on any pull request and I can't find one on the
kernel mailing list.
Perhaps Paul has just done a stealth merge, but the patch to which you
refer doesn't have his signoff.  Very confused.
Guys, can we all play too?
