Thanks.  I suspected as much but don't like to assume.
I've look more thoroughly at this code and I think the message is
meaningless and can be ignored.
Looking in fs/nfs/file.c (at 2.6.18-rc4-mm1 if it matters, but 2.6.17
is much the same)
 - do_vfs_lock is only called when the filesystem was mounted with
    -o nolock  EXCEPT
 - If a lock request to the server in interrupted (when mounted with
     -o intr) then do_vfs_lock is called to try to get the lock
    locally.  Normally equivalent code will be called inside
    fs/lockd/clntproc.c when the server replies that the lock has been
    gained.  In the case of an interrupt though this doesn't happen
    but the lock may still have happened on the server.  So we record
    locally that the lock was gained, to ensure that it gets unlocked
    when the process exits.
As you don't have '-o nolocks' you must be hitting the second case.
The lock call to the server returns -EINTR or -ERESTARTSYS and
do_vfs_lock is called just-in-case.  
As this is a just-in-case call, it is quite possible that the lock is
held by some other process, so getting an error is entirely possible.
So printing the message in this case seems wrong.
On the other hand, printing the message in any other case seems wrong
too, as server locking is not being used, so there is nothing to get
out of sync with.
As a further complication, I don't think that in the just-in-case
situation that it should risk waiting for the lock.
Now maybe we can be sure there is a pending signal which will break
out of any wait (though I'm worried about -ERESTARTSYS - that doesn't
imply a signal does it?), but I would feel more comfortable if
FL_SLEEP were turned off in that path.
So: Trond:  Any obvious errors in the above?
Is the following patch ok?
