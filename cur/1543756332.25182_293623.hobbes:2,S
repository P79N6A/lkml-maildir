Yeah, checking that process is chrooted using the current macro and
denying if capable() gets it trying to access CAP_SYS_CHROOT it's the
way that vSecurity currently does it.
But the hook will have to handle some chdir enforcing that can't be done
with current hooks, I will explain it further tomorrow.
It's too late here ;)
