	Look - the plug was a huge mistake.  I should know - I am the one
responsible for it.   I always intended to go back and get rid of the
thing and do it better, and I never got around to it.
	It wasn't added arbitrarily - it was added to solve a specific
problem.  Let's say for example that you are repeatedly making requests of
16 blocks - without the plug the 1st block would get queued, and then the
remaining 15 would be combined into 1 request.   You would then get a
pattern of reads of 1, 15, 1, 15, 1, 15 blocks.  Roughly a 50%
degradation. 
	What I *SHOULD* have done is something different.  Two
possibilities come to mind - there may well be others that are better.  
One possibility is to move the call to the queueing function up one level.  
A couple of wins here - you don't have the overhead of queueing for each
and every block when you know that more will be coming along as soon as
you are done processing them.  The other possibility would be that you
string the buffers together ahead of time (before you allocate a request)
and then create and insert the request in one atomic operation.   Either
one works without all of that plug crap.   There is no reason we cannot
eliminate the thing entirely.
