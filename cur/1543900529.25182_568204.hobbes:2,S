Hmm, I would have thought that having CONFIG_KVM "select PREEMPT_HOOKS"
would be a little clearer.

The old current/tsk conflation.  You hand in "tsk" here, but since
that's not handed through to the sched_in, it must be "current".  It's
just unfortunate that this generates better code...
But patch looks good.
Cheers,
