Using the correct resource for the job is very optimal, no RAID will 
make big slow cheap drives fast for inodes, no fast drive is practical 
in cost or heat for moderately large data.

Why would you want to use all your resources when only part of them are 
at all suited to the job?
Do consider the price and performance of 15k RPM Ultra320 drives (32GB) 
vs. 750GB SATA before telling me that it doesn't work better to have 
metadata on fast storage and application data on cheap drives. You can 
use 10TB of 300kB avg files in random directories as a model. Figure 10% 
churn every day, delete and create not rewrite, 27 creates/sec and 
200-300 open for read/sec.

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
