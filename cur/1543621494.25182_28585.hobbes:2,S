For some reasons the c/h/s settings reported for LBA disks depend on ide device number: /hda uses 255 heads, 63 sectors while /dev/hdc and above use 16 head, 63 sectors.
hda: 150136560 sectors (76870 MB) w/1916KiB Cache, CHS=9345/255/63, UDMA(33)
hdb: 150136560 sectors (76870 MB) w/1916KiB Cache, CHS=148945/16/63, UDMA(33)
hdc: 150136560 sectors (76870 MB) w/1916KiB Cache, CHS=148945/16/63, UDMA(33)
As you can see, this means you end up with different reported drive geometries for identical disks. Esp. if you want to use software raid this is a major nuisance. The usual workaround is to change head/cylinder settings when first partitioning the drive and let linux change the geometry during partition table check.
Partition check:
 hda: hda1 hda2 < hda5 hda6 > hda3
 hdb: [PTBL] [9345/255/63] hdb1 hdb2 < hdb5 hdb6 > hdb3
 hdc: [PTBL] [9345/255/63] hdc1 hdc2 < hdc5 hdc6 > hdc3
While this works, it's quite unintuitive and confusing; correct behaviour would be to treat all disks identicaly regardless of device number.
Bye, Martin
