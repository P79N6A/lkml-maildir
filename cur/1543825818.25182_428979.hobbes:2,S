I'm willing to help get this fixed. I'm happy working inside kernels and 
drivers
but will need some guidance to know where to focus to track this down.
The obvious problem is solve is why are no interrupts being received by
the tg3.c code.
Which kernel should I use to debug this? 2.6.17 latest RC?
Which debug options do you suggest I turn on to get closer to the problem?
What information should I collect?
