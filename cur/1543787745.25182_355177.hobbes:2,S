+The canonical patch subject line is:
+
+    Subject: [PATCH 001/123] [<area>:] <explanation>
+
+The canonical patch message body contains the following:
+
+    The first line of the body contains a "from" line specifying
+    the author of the patch:
+
+        From: Original Author <author@email.com>
+
+    If the "from" line is missing, then the author of the patch will
+    be recorded in the source code revision history as whomever sent
+    Linus the email (the email message "From:" header.)
+
+    The "from" line is followed by an empty line and then the body
+    of the explanation.
+
+    After the body of the explanation comes the "Signed-off-by:"
+    lines, and then a simple "---" line, and below that comes the
+    diffstat of the patch and then the patch itself.  The "---" line
+    and diffstat are optional, but helpful to readers of non-trivial
+    patches.
+
+The Subject line format makes it very easy to sort the emails
+alphabetically by subject line - pretty much any email reader will
+support that - since because the sequence number is zero-padded,
+the numerical and alphabetic sort is the same.
+
+See further details on how to phrase the "<explanation>" in
+the "Subject:" line in Andrew Morton's "The perfect patch",
+referenced below.
