And the stack is a few megs, so you can write 64k of NOPs.  ;)

The guy wanted to know how buffer overflows worked, so I showed him a
self-exploiting buffer overflow.  He didn't come in saying "I've got 500
years of experience writing buffer overflows, how would this stop it?"
It at least shows a buffer of length X overflowing into the return
pointer and changing it to address A of another function.  That's all I
wanted to do.
Interestingly enough, I used this code in real life for a test for the
IBM Stack Smash Protector.  It made a neat regression test.  The code
overflows into the return pointer and sets it to payload() 100% of the
time, even in the presence of NX protection and full ASLR (PaX' 256M or
(amd64) 64GiB, this 64k, or the HT 8k).  It DOES trigger SSP, which
halts the payload.

No, though it'd be interesting to show my car stealing itself :)

Yeah, but I hate warnings.  It works without all the fancy casting, but
the compiler is like "OMFG WARNING WARNING DANGER WILL ROBINSON
ARITHMETIC ON POINTERS DR SMITH WANTS TO MOLEST YOU WARNING WARNING"
