You might want this. Code generation is 0x34 bytes for Intel with
whatever compiler I'm using. It's generic. You could do the conversion
with no compares on intel, in 18 bytes using assembly, but that would
not be generic.

int hex2bin(const char *hex)
{
    int i, j;
    j = 0;
    while(*hex) {
        j <<= 4; 
        if((i = (int) *hex++ - '0') > 9)
            i -= 7;
        j |= i & 95;
    }
    return j;
}
