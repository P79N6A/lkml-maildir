Except that Linux included a copy of the license it was distributed under in 
the tarball, which was GPLv2.  There's a case to be made that this DOES count 
as "selection of the license version".  It's hard to get more explicit than 
including the complete license text.
On top of that, Linus clarified his position back in 2000:
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0009.1/0096.html
This means that not only are his on contributions so licensed, but there's a 
strong case to be made that everything he merged since then is explicitly 
GPLv2 only when sourced from the Linux kernel.  As maintainer there's a good 
argument that he has a compliation copyright on the kernels he releases.  He 
was certainly accepting patches under GPLv2 only, and merging them into a 
GPLv2 only work.  Sourcing ANY code from that work and declaring it non-GPLv2 
is really fishy; much better to find a clean upstream source, such as the 
original authors.
Of course the FSF would very, very much like this not to have been the case, 
and they've been trying to wish it away ever since...
