Was not splitting hairs. If somebody has a problem, it helps to be
specific.

Correct. The BIOS is never used.

Sure. But remember "Plug and Play" (Plug and Pray) never worked for
anybody, expecially Micro$oft. The drivers all go out and probe. The
major reason is that there are often not enough physical traces on the
motherboard going to the slots. Often (usually) you have to move cards
around to have them found, and found in some useful way.

That's your interpretation. I stated that information from the BIOS is
made available to the kernel. I also stated that you can sometimes 
override this information. I can't understand how you could interpret me
differently.

There are no "services" provided by PNP. There are a bunch of software
hacks in the BIOS, many of which can't possibly work. That's why PNP
doesn't work. The kernel code attempts to work around these problems.
The setting up of the APIC is the first step. The second step is
done by specific driver initialization.

This is the chip-set that supports the PCI/AGP "bridge". It is the thing
that connects the hardware to specific IRQs and specific I/O addresses.
It also has a timer and interrupt-controller as part of the same device.

Erm... I have a Dual SMP machine with a 400Hz internal clock. You have a
single CPU, that's supposed to run at 400 MHz, but it seems to be
overclocked. Further, you are running an experimental version that
probably has fewer bugs than mine.
