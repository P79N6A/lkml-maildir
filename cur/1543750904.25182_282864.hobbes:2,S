This results in
	/*
	 * Leave the last 3% for root
	 */
	if (!capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN))
		allowed -= allowed / 32;
	allowed += total_swap_pages;
	/* Leave the last 3% for root */
	if (current->euid)
		allowed -= allowed / 32;
in security/commoncaps.c (and similarly in security/dummy.c). Why
"super-user" reservation is handled twice, and with that antiquated
current->euid check instead of capabilities? Broken merge?
On another account, shouldn't capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN) checks in
cap_vm_enough_memory() be replaced with capable(CAP_SYS_RESOURCE):
(CAP_SYS_RESOURCE is used by file systems to control reserved disk
blocks)?
Nikita.
