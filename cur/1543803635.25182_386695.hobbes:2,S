Hi,
   I know that ktimer is not yet part of the main tree of the Linux
kernel...
I need an high precision timer in a kernel module for 2.6.14, so I chose to 
use ktimers.
My timer must be stopped and reprogrammed very frequently.
This is how I initialize the timer:
struct ktimer mytimer;
ktimer_init(&mytimer);
mytimer.function = myfunction;
mytimer.data = NULL;
This is how I stop the timer:
ktimer_cancel(&mytimer);
This is how I restart the timer:
ktime_t mytime = ktime_set(...,...);
ktimer_start(&mytimer, &mytime, KTIMER_REL)
However, the timer never fires. I checked the return value of the start and 
it's correct (0 = success). Any idea of why the timer does not fire ?
I tried also by directly using ktimer_restart instead of ktimer_cancel + 
ktimer_start, but the timer does not fire either.
The module has also another ktimer which works perfectly...
Many thanks for your help,
                     Claudio
