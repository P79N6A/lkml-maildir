What, you don't want to use AIO or to collect your AIO signals? ;-)
In my apps, what I'd do is spawn a few worker threads which would do 
blocking reads. Particularly if the sigopen() API allows me to grab 
multiple signals from one fd, this should work well enough for one's high 
performance needs. Alternatively, one could use select/poll to check if 
there was data ready before doing the read. I agree though that it'd be 
nice to have a timed read.
