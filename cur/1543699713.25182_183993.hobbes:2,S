The right mailing list for this is netdev@oss.sgi.com.

Thanks for the good diagnose.

I believe they are freed in skbuff.c::skb_release_data().
I think the place where you've put the fix doesn't cover all cases. If 
ip_frag_destroy() is called, there will still be a memory leak. So I think 
the right place for this is in skb_release_data. But consulting with the 
netdev list seems appropriate :)
You can change
+		if (fp->nf_bridge) {
+			nf_bridge_put(fp->nf_bridge);
+			fp->nf_bridge = NULL;
+		};
into
+		nf_bridge_put(fp->nf_bridge);
cheers,
Bart
