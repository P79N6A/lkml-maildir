Version 2.5.0-pre1 of perfctr, the Linux/x86 performance
monitoring counters driver, is now available at the usual
place: 
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/perfctr/
This is a development snapshot. Although it should work well,
it is not binary or API compatible with the current stable
version (2.4.5).
Version 2.5.0-pre1, 2003-02-19
- Fixed the driver's API to support global-mode perfctrs on 2.5
  SMP kernels and asymmetric hyper-threaded P4 multiprocessors.
  Updated examples/global/global.c for the new API.
- Minor library cleanups. Updated example programs accordingly.
- API cleanup: Removed obsolete STOP command from the driver
  for virtual perfctrs. The library now uses CONTROL instead.
- Proper detection and support for AMD K8 processors. They are
  similar to the K7s, but the event sets are not identical.
- The library's event set descriptions have been redesigned and
  expanded to include unit mask descriptions and descriptions of
  Intel P4 and AMD K8 events. The etc/perfctr-events.tab text file
  has been removed since event_codes.h now is generated from the
  library's data structures.
