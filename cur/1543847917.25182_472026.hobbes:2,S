They do wind up at the same oops, from the same "testcase" (i.e. beat the tar 
out of the filesystem with multiple fsx's and fsstress...)
The buffer is not dirty at that tracepoint because it has just done
                 if (locked && test_clear_buffer_dirty(bh)) {
prior to the tracepoint...

Well, it's hard to sort out which thread is doing what; I added a pid to each 
tracepoint to try to make that a little easier.  Both of the traces I posted 
seem to be journal_submit_data_buffers leading to an unmapped buffer submitted 
in submit_bh.

Well, they were just undirtied in journal_submit_data_buffers.
See the whole traces at

http://people.redhat.com/esandeen/traces/eric_ext3_oops2.txt
I will try to reproduce with fewer threads, to see if we can find a simpler 
sequence of events...
As an aside, when we do journal_unmap_buffer... should it stay on t_sync_datalist?
Thanks,
