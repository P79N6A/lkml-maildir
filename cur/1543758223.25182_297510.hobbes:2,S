This patch has already been posted to linux-fbdev on 2005-02-10 by David Vrabel
and made me ask
	Is there any reason why this has been originally flagged "__init"?
	"vesa_modes" is not "__init". That's why I changed "intelfb" to
	use "vesa_modes".
Maybe time has come to decide, if availability of "modedb" outside
of init functions is more important than freeing (unused) kernel memory.
