   From: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@transmeta.com>
   The way code gets added to the kernel is when somebody cares enough to
   write it, and it looks good enough to add.
   Code does NOT get added to the kernel just because somebody makes a big
   deal of nothing.
Ulrich,
Linus is right, no major structural change is necessary.  For example,
here's a very short patch necessary to support __SC_CLK_TCK (which is
probably the most interesting of the sysconf() variables as far as I'm
concerned.)  It's only a 5-line patch.  (See below)
The more interesting case is actually pathconf and fpathconf, which
allows a program to fetch information about limits of the filesystem for
a particular pathname or file descriptor happens.  This may become
interesting as we start supporting more filesystems.  However, this is
(in my opinion) a 2.5 issue.
