Subject: [PATCH 1/9] [PATCH] Kconfig: saa7134-dvb must select tda1004x
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any  objections, please let us know.
------------------
I wish I had seen this before 2.6.13 was released... I guess this only 
goes to show that there haven't been any testers using saa7134-hybrid 
dvb/v4l boards that depend on the tda1004x module, during the 2.6.13-rc 
series :-(
Please apply this to 2.6.14, and also to 2.6.13.1 -stable.  Without this 
patch, users will have to EXPLICITLY select tda1004x in Kconfig.  This 
SHOULD be done automatically when saa7134-dvb is selected.  This patch 
corrects this problem.
saa7134-dvb must select tda1004x
