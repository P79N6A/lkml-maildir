It slips in occasionally.  LVM in 2.4.0-test had #include <endian.h>, I
vaguely remember some compression code that included glibc headers by
mistake.  We weed them out of the kernel whenever we spot them, they
tend not to live very long.  Christoph Hellwig suggested a Makefile
change that prevents kernel code including user space headers, it is
included in kbuild 2.5 and there is a 2.4 version in
