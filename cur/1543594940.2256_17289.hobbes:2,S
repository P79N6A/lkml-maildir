I doubt it.
Think about somebody who writes a partial page (but a full buffer).
Somebody _else_ then reads the rest of the page. You'll have one buffer
up-to-date (but possibly under write-back IO), and the others being read
in asynchronously.

The above _will_ break. "tmp" may be locked due to the write - and the
write will never call "end_buffer_io_async" because writes do not unlock
the page. So if the write finishes last, you'll _never_ unlock the page.
I don't see why Stefan wants to change the current logic. The current
logic is correct, and if there are double-unlock problems then those are
due to some other bug.
