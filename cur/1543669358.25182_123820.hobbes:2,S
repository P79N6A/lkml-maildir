To propagate the idea further, why not have proper message catalogs,
and that way translations.  Instead of:
> printk(KERN_WARN "This driver is messed up!\n");
There would be:
  printk(KERN_WARN "1234-6789 this driver is messed up!\n")
In the old days of big iron beasts, there used to be multivolume
binders full of system messages, and their explanations.
Searching went thru those "1234-5678" strings.
There were sets of those manuals in a number of customer languages.

Compiled in strings take up kernel space, which has better uses.
Even those code-labels take up space. If not much in kernel (in
form of e.g. 32 bit integers ?) then at least in the  dmesg  buffer.
