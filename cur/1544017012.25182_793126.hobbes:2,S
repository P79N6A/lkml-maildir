Well, the clock API doesn't have the concept of constraints or machine
selectable per-clock options such as those set in constraints - it's the
biggest difference between the two APIs.

Yeah, but user visible things in Kconfig aren't quite the same thing as
having something in the machine definition set it up.  At present
control is very firmly in the hands of the board setup code.

There's got to be an explict knob, it's just a question of where it's
exposed.
For machines where it works it's something I'd expect the kernel to just
do without having a Kconfig variable set up.  The machine driver is
already going to have to explictly set up all the regulators that are in
use in the system for this to work so the additional cost of requesting
the feature if it were per-board doesn't feel onerous.  It also means
that people configuring the kernel don't need to worry about how well
the regulators are mapped out, which would be especially useful to
anyone trying to build kernels that run on multiple boards.

Yeah, I think that since there's no clean way for clients to disable a
boot_on regulator currently it's only really useful in the very unsual
case where you can't read the regulator state.  If it just enabled the
regulator without incrementing the use count it may possibly useful for
during boot.  I'd need to have a proper think about it to make sure.
