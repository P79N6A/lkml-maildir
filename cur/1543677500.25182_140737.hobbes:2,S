Hi,
while debugging glibc-2.3.1 for cris-axis-linux-gnu, I encountered a 
discrepancy between code and comments explaining the return value of 
syscalls of the kernel (in glibc's source, architecture specific for 
cris). The comment says, values between -4095 and -1 (both inclusive) 
are considered to be an error. However, the code checks the return value 
to be greater or equal than -4096.
I'd like to fix that. But I need to know what's wrong, the code or the 
comment. So, what values indicate an error in linux's syscalls?
Best regards, Uwe
P.S.: A look in other architecture's source in glibc makes me thing the 
comment is right. I just want to make sure.
