Thanks.
I now realized that counters in struct zone should be better candidates.
And the slots may be used to calculate the real inter-reference distances
for dropped pages. For the present pages, we can either add entries to each
page, or to radix_tree_node. I suspect the latter is enough because it should
work well with sequential reads and sequential reads are the majority of page
activities and the main source of flushing.
