Nice! I was wanting to do that for a long time...

Yes, lets drop it in while we still not reached rc1.

Good riddance... Athough I would not remove input_regs() just yet but
just redefine it to an empty inline and mark it as depreciated so we
won't break all out-of-tree input drivers right away. Removal of
input_regs() from in-tree drivers could be done by separate patch as
well, once main changes are in.
