When my BIOS finds IDE disks, it starts at the lowest address of
the port. It then looks for the first master, then the slave(s), etc.
Then it tries the second, etc.
When my SCSI BIOS finds disks, it starts at the first controller,
the first LUN, the first drive, etc.
This used to even be the way disks were located by the kernel
drivers. Now, these are found in some "random" order.
If whatever is causing the "random" order was fixed, put back like
it used to be, etc., we wouldn't have these problems.
