Subject: use of fixmap on non-x86/sh?

Ben and I are talking about using fixmap on ppc for similar  
applications to it use on x86.  However in poking around other arch's  
(sparc, mips) they appear to have some support but not as complete as  
x86.
For example both SPARC & MIPS reference __set_fixmap() in asm/fixmap.h  
but I can't find an implementation on either.
So I was wondering if there was some reason fixmap isn't as well  
supported or if its just used for a specific function on those SPARC,  
MIPS, etc. and they dont need as much functionality out of it as x86  
does.
