I've looked into this, and I've come to the conclusion that Chip
indeed has spotted a long-standing bug. Our current kmod successfully
isolates modprobe from the user process which triggered it, but it
doesn't isolate init_task (and its CLONE_FS friends) from modprobe.
Since modprobe in recent modutils may call chdir, we have a problem.
(No, I don't think we should forbid modprobe from calling chdir.
It's the kernel's job to get this right.)
The pach below fixes this. It's based on Chip's patch, with
a few cleanups and a correction [setting umask].
I've been privately running with a kmod based on daemonize()
the last month or so, so I also added some of its behaviour
[setting session and pgrp]. Unfortunately, we cannot use
daemonize() because of the fs sharing problem. Sigh.
