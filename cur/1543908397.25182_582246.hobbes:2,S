True. This simply means that the leading \n's shouldn't be there.
Pretty easy to fix.

Assuming that the related messages are prefixed in a similar way (as
dev_info and friends do), grouping them is already possible, and pretty
trivial: grep can select whatever you are interested in.
I'm not saying that your ideas are all bad. The ability to build a
kernel without the least interesting messages is valuable. Having a
more standard formatting for log messages is interesting as well,
although dev_info and friends already offer this to some extent. But
you have to realize that kernel logging must stay something very
simple, and that the first tool to read them is "dmesg" and not some
funky log scanner. So the current implementation can't be that far from
what we need.
Thanks,
