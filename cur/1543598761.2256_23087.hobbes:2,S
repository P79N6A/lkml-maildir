man modules.conf, under options keyword
  If any of the MODULE_SPECIFIC_OPTIONS contain characters that are
  special to the shell (e.g.  space, comma, parentheses) then the
  option must be enclosed in '"..."'.  The '' delimit the option in
  modules.conf, the "" delimit the option when it is passed to the
  shell.  For example,
    abc='"def,ghi jkl (xyz)"'
If that does not work for a string, tell me.
