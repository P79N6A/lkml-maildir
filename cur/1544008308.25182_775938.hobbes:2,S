It can cause data corruption because the GART redirects the IO to a
wrong address because of a stale entry in its TLB. I found this bug
after I fixed the same issue in the AMD IOMMU code (commit 80be308d).
The reason this was not found earlier is that lazy flushing is not the
default in GART. But I didn't try to trigger the bug.
