It's not encrypted, it's an authentication protocol. You really do need
to know that you are receiving a reliable set of information otherwise
anyone can spoof you with bad data and play havoc with your clock and
timestamps.

That's pretty easy. Install BIND 9.6.0. Read the DNSSEC deployment
instructions here: 
https://www.isc.org/files/DNSSEC_in_6_minutes.pdf
 and
implement. You should be done in almost no time.

Sorry, but that's not my area of expertise. I just know we have many
people running Linux and have these issues.

I bow to your superior knowledge in this area.
