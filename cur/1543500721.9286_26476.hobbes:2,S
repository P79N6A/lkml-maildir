I just need/did that but not for a filesystem that span multiple devices,
but more simply for writing dirty buffers to disk at once. If you remeber
I just sent you the patch for ll_rw_block but you showed me a pseudo-code
implementation of an helper function to handle such multi-device work
without change ll_rw_block. I can finish the real implementation of
course, just tell me "do that" :). Currently I am still running with a
multi-device capable ll_rw_block because having ll_rw_block multi-device
capable seems to me the cleaner solution and that may perform better than
the helper function if the block-device changes every time (unlikely I
know...).
BTW, I think that a filesystem that span over multiple devices could make
better choices than raid, right?
