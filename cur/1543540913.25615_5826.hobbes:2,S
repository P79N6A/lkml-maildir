Yep. I know what causes this.
Are you running the latest nfs-utils? You want at least 0.1.7.1.
         showmount --version  
tells you the version.
What is happening is that the filehandle returned by mountd is
different from the file handle returned by nfsd for the same file (the
mounted directory in this case).
This, quite reasonably, confused solaris.

Presumably you are exporting a sub directory of a filesystem and not
it's root?  You get this "bad export" because the solaris client is
asking for ".." of the mountpoint, and getting an unexported
directory.
So, if you are using < 0.1.7.1, upgrade.
If you are using >= 0.1.7.1, tell me and I will look more closely.
