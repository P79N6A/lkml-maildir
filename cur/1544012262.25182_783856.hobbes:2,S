Unfortunately we failed to take this fix into Santa's bag...
Note that this bug affects mask condition after calling pci_enable_msi()
for devices with MSI capability with (optional) per-vector masking support.
Devices with MSI-X or MSI without masking support are safe.
Once unmask/mask_msi_irq() is called, the condition should be fixed.
And the wrong pci_write_config_dword() will have no effects because
target registers (fields in header, such as Vendor ID) are read-only.
Thanks,
