Hello hpa,
I failed to find a comment referring to 0x413 or int 0x12 in
arch/x86/kernel. I do know the comment in Documentation/i386/boot.txt,
however, suggesting that "INT 12h" _should_ be used, but that it would
be pointless for zImage and old bzImage kernels, because they _have_
to be started from 0x90000 anyway. New bzImage kernels do not have
this limitation, and smart bootloaders simply put them at much
lower addresses, like 0x40000. (I know: you know.) My point is just
that the argument not to use 0x413 in the bootloader is not valid
for this case.
That leaves the possibility that code/data is inserted at the top of
conventional memory by either the BIOS or some kind of bootloader.
My view on this is that this code/data should be preserved: it
was specifically asked from us by lowering 0x413. One just loses
a tiny bit of usable memory, and if the program booting the kernel
knows better it can unload the driver if it wants to. It's just
not a kernel problem.

Of course. That's also why I already added the old-Dell case ;).
But one problem at a time, please!
