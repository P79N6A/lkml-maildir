Dunno.  There's an unresolved RCU dentry reaping problem, but that's
unlikely to occur within ksoftirqd context.

uses lock_kernel() at the top level.  Need to know the call trace to work
out who the offender is.  rtc-debug+amlat will tell you that, because it
catches the CPU hog while it's being hoggy, rather than after it has
finished.

Lots of udelays() inside spin_lock_irq().  This is a "don't do that", I
suspect.

Would need to see the amlat trace.

This can run under one of two depths of lock_kernel.  filemap_fdatawrite()
and filemap_fdatawait() both do cond_resched(), so this is odd.

You'll get better traces from
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/rtc-debug.patch
and
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/amlat.tar.gz
Just apply rtc-debug, set CONFIG_RTC=y and run `amlat' as root while doing
testing.
