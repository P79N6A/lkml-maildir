Unless I am reading the following wrong 5513 is the PCI ID:
00:02.5 Class 0101: 1039:5513 (rev 01) (prog-if 80 [Master])
	Subsystem: 1043:8139
	Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 128
	I/O ports at <unassigned>
	I/O ports at <unassigned>
	I/O ports at <unassigned>
	I/O ports at <unassigned>
	I/O ports at ffa0 [size=16]
	Capabilities: [58] Power Management version 2
