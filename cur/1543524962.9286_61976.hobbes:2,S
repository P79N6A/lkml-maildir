I just read a message from someone who wanted some clarification
about kernel locks and copying to/from the user. Unfortunately my
machine hung (version 2.3.41) so I lost the response during the
reboot. So here is a response recovered from /lost+found with
a bit of editing.
You must not copy_to_user() under a lock. This is because the
user's pages may not be in memory and the kernel needs to page-
fault.
Unfortunately, this often means that you have to copy twice, double
buffer. However, a typical PC nowdays can copy over 800 megabytes per
second.
Here is a typical bench-mark.

This shows that double-buffering adds little overhead to the transfer
compared to the time it already took to get data from a shared-RAM device
of from an I/O port. In this case, ram-to-ram went at 1,677 megabytes
per second.
What you have to do with buffers that could be modified either
by an interrupt or by another thread is something like this:
    /*
     * This is not going to change until after we return, so you
     * can check this with no lock.
     */
    if(!access_okay(VERIFY_WRITE, user_buf, request_length);
        return -EFAULT;
    /*
     * Now get a temporary buffer. Its allocation does not have to
     * be atomic because there are no locks yet and we are in kernel
     * mode, but user context. 
     */
    ptr = (WHATEVER *) kmalloc(sizeof(WHATEVER), GFP_KERNEL); /* Not locked */
    /*
     *  Now lock the buffer with a lock that will work with SMP as well
     *  as single-cpu machines.
     */
    spin_lock_irqsave(&device_lock, flags);
    /*
     * Now copy to the local buffer under the lock.
     */ 
    memcpy(ptr, irq_buffer, len);
    /*
     * Release the lock as soon as possible.
     */
    spin_unlock_irqrestore(&device_lock, flags);
    /*
     *  Now copy to the user without a lock.
     */
    copy_to_user(user_buf, ptr, len);
    /*
     * Don't want a memory leak.
     */
    kfree(ptr);
    Now, with some drivers, it's better to allocate the temporary buffer
    once when the driver is installed. You free it once before you
    uninstall the device. This is more efficient. However, in many
    cases you need a linked-list of buffers. At some point it is
    more efficient to allocate and deallocate as you go.
