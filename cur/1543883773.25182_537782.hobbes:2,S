Documentation/CodingStyle is indeed a bit ambiguous w.r.t. this. It does
mention what Andrew is saying here: a closing brace always on a line of its
own _except_ that an "else" may appear immediately after the closing brace
of the previous statement block in if-else statements. Unfortunately, this goes
against the example given in K&R Section 3.2 and the example given to
illustrate this in CodingStyle itself shows a multiple-condition
if-else-if statement,
not a single-condition if-else (and K&R do treat if-else-if's differently than
if-else's for indentation purposes). No harm in continuing to stick to the usual
style, of course, as K&R are not consistent about this themselves.

Existing kernel code is all over the place w.r.t. this one. Even a same
person doesn't follow a single convention all the time (see kernel/signal.c
for all sorts of compound-conditions-indentation-abuse :-)

Actually, the latter style (one condition per line and the && or ||
operators appearing _before_ the conditions in subsequent lines)
is quite popular for multi-line compound conditions (well, I've seen this
in kernel/workqueue.c, kernel/stop_machine.c, etc at least, and also in
Linus' code, if I'm not mistaken). We also align subsequent lines to the
column of the condition belonging to the same "logical level" on the
previous line using _spaces_ (note that this is alignment, not indentation,
using spaces). The rationale is to make the operator prominent and thus make
the structure of a complex multi-line compound conditional expression more
readable and obvious at first glance itself. For example, consider:
	if (veryverylengthycondition1 &&
		smallcond2 &&
		(conditionnumber3a ||
		condition3b)) {
		...
	}
versus
	if (veryverylengthycondition1
	    && smallcond2
	    && (conditionnumber3a
	        || condition3b)) {
		...
	}
?
Latter wins, doesn't it?
