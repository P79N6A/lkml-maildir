I'm wondering if we shouldn't have a (__)switch_to paravirt hook, so we 
can wrap the context switch in whatever we like.

Hm.  Zach removed the pushf/popf in switch_to this last Sept, with the 
comment "The pushf/popf in switch_to are ONLY used to switch IOPL. 
Making this explicit in C code is more clear.  This pushf/popf pair was 
added as a bugfix for leaking IOPL to unprivileged processes when using 
sysenter/sysexit based system calls (sysexit does not restore flags)."

Rusty, Chris Wright and me.
