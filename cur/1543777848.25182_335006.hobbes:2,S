Hos does that work if offset >= m?

Directories clearly can't have zero size, so 0 means 'special'.
Anything other than zero *might* be a real value.

Why?  And what should that upper bound be?

lseek talks about bytes --- yes, it means for files specifically but I
still don't see why we need to define more counter-intuitive semantics
for directories when we don't need them.
Also, how is lseek + readdir supposed to work in general?
