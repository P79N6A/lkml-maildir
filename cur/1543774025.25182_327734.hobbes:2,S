I'm involved in other things now, but I wouldn't be surprised if it
was some kind of scheduler bug + softirq wacked interaction. softirqs,
from the last time I looked, was pretty raw in RT. Another thing to do
is to subtract the number of irq-thread context switches from the total
system context switch to see if there's any kind of oddities with the
spinlock conversion. I doubt there's going to be a ton of 'overscheduling',
nevertheless it would be a valuable number. This is such a new patch
that weird things like this are likely, but it's going to take an
investigation to see what the real cause is.
FreeBSD went through some slow down when they moved to SMPng, but not
the kind of numbers you show for things surrounding the network stack.
Something clearly bad happened.
