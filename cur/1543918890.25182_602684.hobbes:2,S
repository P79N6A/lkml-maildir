No mention about the iwarp port space issue?
Here is the status of the current proposed patch:
- needs another round of changes based on Sean's feedback
- Arkady raised issues about the pain this puts on admins
- it forces services like nfs-rdma, which already separates the nfs-rdma 
server by port number, to needlessly use a separate subnet for the rdma 
service.
I'm at a loss as to how to proceed.
Any ideas?
Steve.
