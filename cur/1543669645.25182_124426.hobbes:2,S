No doubt. And then you get into the situation where the devices themselves have 
names and/or UUIDs, and you want that to be incorporated into the device name. 
As it stands today, the only way to achieve that is pass that information to 
device-mapper so it can create devices with those names.
Personally, I wouldn't be upset if _all_ "physical volumes" (meaning an 
accessible block devices or portion thereof) appeared under /dev/volume/... Even 
logical volumes could be done that way, since they have names as well. I don't 
really see the need to have "whole disks", "partitions" and other types of 
volumes in separate directories under /dev, but then I may be way off base with 
the rest of the world wants to do :-)
