Me too, but what I've been told is that there's no guarantee for the
union/struct layouts being exactly like you (and the hardware) expects
them to be across toolchains, etc.
The endianness issues are also painful, in architecture-specific code it's
obviously not as big an issue as in generic drivers. Single-architecture
system drivers are a grey area in that aspect, but it's better to set
good examples then bad ones for the generic driver writers looking for
example code.
