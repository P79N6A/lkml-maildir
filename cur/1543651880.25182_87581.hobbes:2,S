Thanks for the response. When you say zerocopy networking, do you refer to
zerocopy receives too? What linux kernel version offers this support? I am
making use of 2.4.17 ...

Yes, we have zero-copy networking if the device supports the requisite
features and the driver is so coded.
Quick glance over 2.4, it looks like the following drivers support
zero-copy networking: via-rhine, tg3, sunhme, sungem, starfire, ns83820,
dl2k, acenic, 8139too, 8139cp, 3c59x family (includes 3c9xx), Intel
e100, and Intel e1000.
