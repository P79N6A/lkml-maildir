I think the platform helper need to be able to either return from the
function directly or at least you should read back the state before
continuing. The platform helper may call into firmware which might
handle the complete state transition. Thus, when you come back from it,
you probably need to check the device-state, or provide return codes for
the platform helper to affect the code flow of the rest of the function.
