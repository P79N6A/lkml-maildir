MMF basically means the "Transaction Translating" (TT) hub had data
for the host, but the host didn't collect it in time ... so that some
data was lost.
Unfortunately, that's the type of fault that's especially hard to
recover from.  Plus, very few of the upper layer drivers have even
a minor clue about fault recovery strategies.  And I don't trust
the current hcd/usbcore code that tries to clean up after MMF.
On the plus side, MMF errors have been vanishingly rare until this
cpufreq interaction came up ... which of course implies the downside
that those "handle the result" code paths are all but untested.

There could be such problems, yes.  But in practice, I don't know
that we've ever seen them.  (There's a first time for everthing,
yes.  I *just* fetched a webpage where an image got overwritten
