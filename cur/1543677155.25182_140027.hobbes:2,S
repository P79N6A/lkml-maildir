Thanks for the tip, but no, the enclosure with the 250 GB drive does
support ATA 6.  However, the other enclosure with the 120 GB drive is
ATA 5 only. 
After rebooting, I am able to mount the 250 GB reiserfs partition, 
and I'm pretty sure that reiserfs accesses data past the 120 GB boundary
during the mount process.  (I only have 8 GB of data on the partition at
the moment though...)
More bug reports on sbp2 coming in a second :-)
