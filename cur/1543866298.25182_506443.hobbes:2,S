I still need to test this, but I believe I have found a simpler
way to avoid irr problems during migration, and I believe the code
works equally well with either edge or level triggered interrupts.
The idea is this: Instead of trying test for and handle when irr
occurs, simply enable local interrupts after disabling and
acknowledging the irq so that anything pending will be processed,
before we perform the migration operation.
I don't think the edge case cares about the mask/ack order but
but masking before acking appears important for the level triggered
case, so we might as well use that order for both.
Does this look like a sane way to handle this?
static void ack_apic(unsigned int irq)
{
	struct irq_desc *desc = irq_desc + irq;
	int do_unmask_irq = 0;
	if (unlikely((irq_desc[irq].status & IRQ_MOVE_PENDING) && !in_irq()) {
		do_unmask_irq = 1;
		desc->chip->mask(irq);
	}
	ack_APIC_irq();
	if (unlikely(do_unmask_irq)) {
		/* Don't let pending irqs accumulate */
		local_irq_enable();
                syncrhonize_irq(irq);
		move_masked_irq(irq);
		local_irq_disable();
		desc->chip->unmask(irq);
	}
}
