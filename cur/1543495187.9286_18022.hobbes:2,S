File locking is not supported by the userland nfsd. If you want true
file locking, use knfsd. 2.0.x kernels supported local file locks
only: this is why they 'worked' (not at all), and 2.2.x will do the
same if you use the 'nolock' mount option.
In other words: Always compile mutt/elm/pine etc to use dotlocking or
some such workaround when you think you might want to use the userland
nfsd or a 2.0.x kernel, since posix file locking will never be
reliable in that case. (BSD file locking is not supported for 2.2.x
either.)
