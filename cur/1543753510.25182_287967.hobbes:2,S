I want to thank the Linux folks for adding this patch.  In a nutshell:
works great!
We ran -rc2 with the patch on our test server overnight w/stress testing,
then 3 days on a production web server, and finally we deployed the
patched -rc2 on all public-accessable servers.  The "incomplete arp problem"
never showed up.
(Now that 2.4.29 is out, we're going to do an upgrade across the board...)
Thanks again, you guys rock!
