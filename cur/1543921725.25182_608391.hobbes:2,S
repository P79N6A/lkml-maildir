I think I see what you're saying now. That we really should do the push on
wakeup, since only the one rt task that is woken up will be able to be
pushed.
My code may seem a bit aggressive, but from logging, I see that we seldom
push more than one task. But if we don't go ahead and push more than one,
the rt-migrate-test will sometimes fail.  There's funny cases when we need
to push more than one. I can't remember exactly what they were, but
sometimes because of races between the pushes and pulls where one will
miss the fact that an RT process is being queued while its searching to
pull a task, but the push will catch it. Or vice versa.
The max tries is just a paranoid case where I don't want heavy scheduling
to cause an unbounded trying to push or pull tasks. According to the
logging while running the rt-migrate-tests, the loop there repeated
approximately 1 in 20, and iterated twice 1 in 100 and hit the third loop
twice in all my tests (over a 1000 iterations being logged). But logging
slows it down and modifies the results itself, and perhaps I'll add
statistics soon.
I'm about to post a second batch of patches.
Thanks,
