Many ISP use Ascend dial-in routers which support only the lame ('coz
proprietary) STAC/MS-STAC/LZ-anything compression which Linux-ppp does
not support, while the Ascend cannot be fitted with PPP-Deflate or
BSD-Compress either. :-(
I'd really like to see compatibility with this Ascend compression to
speed up general connection throughput, while not using strange
squid-ssh-hacks. I bugged the dialin-admin at Dortmund University quite
a bit, he finally gave up on Ascend, he said there was nothing he could
do while he really would like to. Not sure if bugging the Deutsche
Telekom AG will help, since they seem to "support" only Windows as
well.
