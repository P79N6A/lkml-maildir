What happens if you plug in your cardbus card before the dlink wlan card?
If that doesn't work, please repeat your procedure to cause the oops.
In either case, could you send the output of lspci -vv at the
following points:
- directly after boot
- after you insert the cardbus card
- after you remove it
- after you re-insert (and get the oops)
Thanks.
