Yes.

I'll do it in a week.

I've made two functions.
record_unmapped_address() holds mm and address where a target page
has been mapped. touch_unmapped_address() remaps the page again.

It was the easiest way to handle pages with buffers when Iwamoto
and I started to implement it. We thought it was slow but it would
work for all kinds of filesystems.

Yes, I also realize that.
migrate_page_buffer() will do this, but I'm not certain it will work
for all kinds of filesystems. I guess there might be some exceptions.
We may need a special operation to handle pages on a filesystem,
which has releasepage method.
