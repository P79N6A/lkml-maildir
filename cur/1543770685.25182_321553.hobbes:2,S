I ran into this myself, however, I had 10 disks (5 per channel) and one
chennel went down.  Ok, my array was dead at that point and I had to reboot. 
What luck, the arry wasn't usable anymore.  My /usr was on that array, but
my / was not.  I did not want to go through the initrd/initramfs thing at
the time to setup my / with raid5, plus the fact you truely cannot boot from
it (thus partitioning and setting aside a slice wasn't viable to me)

I had to reconstruct the array by hand with mdadm.  evms wouldn't touch it. 
Fortunately, I had a copy of each disk's information and the raid5's
information in files so it was quite easy to rebuild.  I did have backups
but that wasn't really what I wanted to do.  (It did take over 2 hours
before I could return to normal.  evms can't handle a raid5 that was in
reconstruction.  I think newer versions have this fixed.)

That'd be nice =)
