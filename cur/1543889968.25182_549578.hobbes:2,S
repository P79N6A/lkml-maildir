One of my servers runs 3 different instances of the "kadmind"  
Kerberos daemon, one for each realm which I need to be able to modify/ 
change-passwords/etc.  In order to differentiate and stop/restart the  
appropriate daemon, I have a simple starter script which runs each  
kadmind process with a unique name derived from the realm (EG:  
"kadmind(EXAMPLE.COM)", "kadmind(OTHER.EXAMPLE.COM)").  Since this is  
a Kerberos server I use a very strict SELinux-based policy, yet my  
management tools need to be able to easily add and remove realms in a  
secure fashion.  It sounds like TOMOYO Linux would not be able to  
handle this situation at all;  I would either have to completely turn  
off that security "feature" and lose most of the functionality of  
TOMOYO Linux, or hard-code the list of realms into the policy file  
and have to completely reload policy every time I need to add/remove  
realms (big gaping security hole).
Cheers,
