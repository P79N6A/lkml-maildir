Subject: [PATCH] replace "make ARCH=i386/x86_64 with make ARCH=x86"
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/3/147

This patchset unify the i386 and x86_64 Kconfig
files for x86.
In addition it replaces the use of ARCH=i386 and
ARCH=x86_64 with the more intuitive ARCH=x86.
The primary purpose of this patch serie is to 
enable make ARCH=x86 and let the config decide
if we are building for 32 or 64 bit.
But we will break quite a high number of
scripts with this change.
What is the desired behaviour when specifying:
make ARCH=i386
and
make ARCH=x86_64
??
For now it just error out like this:
$ make ARCH=i386
Makefile:503: /home/sam/kernel/x86.git/arch/i386/Makefile: No such file or directory
make: *** No rule to make target `/home/sam/kernel/x86.git/arch/i386/Makefile'.  Stop.
What is the required functionality here?
Note - only patch 9 and 10 are changing any behaviour.
So if we decide to keep current functionality then
the first 8 patches still makes a lot of sense.
The patch serie contains:
Sam Ravnborg (10):
      x86: unification of cfufreq/Kconfig
      x86: start unification of arch/x86/Kconfig.*
      x86: arch/x86/Kconfig.cpu unification
      x86: add X86_32 dependency to i386 specific symbols in Kconfig.i386
      x86: add X86_64 dependency to x86_64 specific symbols in Kconig.x86_64
      x86: copy x86_64 specific Kconfig symbols to Kconifg.i386
      x86: add remaning bits from x86_64 to Kconfig.i386
      x86: combine all config options with prompts in Kconfig
      x86: select i386 or x86_64 at config time
      x86: enable make ARCH=x86
The diffstat looks promising:

A patch that makes the kernel more than 1500 line smaller
is a good patch!
Full diffstat (as git can show it):

The serie can be pulled from:
	ssh://master.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sam/x86.git
Patches will follow in seperate thread.
This serie replaces the single patch I posted the other day.
This serie are made to ease review and to do so a few of the patches
does not change functionality but are just preparing for later steps.
