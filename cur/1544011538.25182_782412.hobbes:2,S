Sorry, assumed you'd be reading linux-kernel.

I was trying to make a guide for people to try and avoid the general
mistakes such as returning -ENODEV when it clearly isn't the right
thing to do. There are a number of drivers which return this causing
confusion as to why devices are not being bound as they neither print
an error nor cause the driver core to print anything [1].
The idea is to provide a guide to what error numbers are acceptable
to return and what the best return code for the common situations
that drivers tend to do and what to avoid.
As a note, having looked at the base driver, pci, platform and i2c
they all pass the error straight back to the core driver probe.
[1] There is a case to be put that drivers such as the i2c bus where
    the machine specific support has declared a device to be present
    to report an error if the probe then returns an -ENODEV or -ENXIO
    to say the device is not there.
