I don't think M$ is a useful comparison to make.
For M$, innovate == bloat and bad design.

If you've got a problem with NFS, try Coda instead. Perhaps that
addresses many of your concerns.

Firstly, there are legitimate questions about *where* these changes
should be made. Perhaps they are best left to a library.
Secondly, we haven't seen a convincining argument as to why putting a
