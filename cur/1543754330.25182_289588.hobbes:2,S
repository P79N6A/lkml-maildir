this is probably a stupid question, but how are weak references used?
Usually if a symbol is referenced by a module, but isn't resolved at
load time, the module refuses to load. dynamic references allow a way
to work around this for some applications, but I'm unfamiliar with
weak references being used in this regard.
or does that statement really mean "if we supported weak references,
they would only be done once..."
Thanks,
