{sigh}  Not again.  Come on Oliver...  Go read the archives for why
Linus does not want us to put device nodes in sysfs.  
Putting device attributes such as led colors, servo motor controls, etc,
look to be much the same idea, are much different from the traditional
block and character nodes we are used to in Unix.
Think of them as mini device specific file systems instead, mounted in a
device tree.
I don't want to discuss this again...
