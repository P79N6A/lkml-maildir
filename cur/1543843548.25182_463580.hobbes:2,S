"LTT proved that ..." what are you talking about? Have you noticed
the posting earlier regarding the fact that the ltt tracepoints did
not change over a 5 year span? **five** years ... Where do you get
this claim that ltt trace points "started piling up"? Have a look
at figure 2 of this article and let me know exactly which of those
tracepoints are actually a problem to you:
