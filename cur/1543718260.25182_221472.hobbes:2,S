Yep. Thanks for your help Steven.
I don't think anyone has cleared up the performance regression
problem yet though, so I'll have to bug you a bit more.
Steven, with all else being equal, you said you found a 2.6.3 SuSE
kernel to significantly outperform 2.6.6, is that right? If so can
you try the same test with plain 2.6.3 please? We'll go from there.
This one isn't urgent, because I suspect it could be something
specific to the SuSE kernel rather than a regression in Linus' tree
- we've heard no other complaints... so just whenever you get the
chance.
