Hi Al. Thanks for taking the time to respond.
A & B) I originaly had plans to make the driver work under a variety of 
different VFSs (maybe freebsd and atheos) and to have user-space tools 
(like the old mtools for DOS) for people on other OSs. That was the 
motivation behind those extra abstractions, but I've actually kinda lost 
interest in the idea. I'll just take 'em out if it really offends 
people's asthetic sense. Perhaps kernel drivers just weren't meant to be 
portable.
B) The PPC and x86 versions of BeOS each write their filesystem metadata 
in native byte-order. So this would only be a problem with disks that 
were formatted on a big-endian system and read on a little-endian (or 
the other way around, of course). I've been meaning to handle that case 
"someday".
D) Ok. I killed that test.
E) To my knowledge, there are not sparse files on BeFS.
F) Ideally, I would detect both the endianness of the filesystem and the 
host, and refuse to mount if they differ (or byte-swap the metadata). 
Can I rely on #ifdef __LITTLE_ENDIAN to detect the endianness I am 
running on?
G) Same thing as B, I think.
H) Yeah. I despise editors that won't line-wrap for you. But this is 
unix, so I guess I gotta accomodate them. Is makeing sure they don't 
overflow 80 columns enough? Or should that be 78?

How so, please?
