I had a somewhat equivalent problem with suspend-to-ram (working but
no wakeup) which required two patches:
- add PWRB and LID0 as wakeup devices[1]
- ignore PRWF since it doesn't send acpi events [2]
It was with a 2.6.8-rc2 kernel, so the situation may have changed since then.
  OG.
[1] Seems added now, did you check the contents of /proc/acpi/wakeup_devices ?
