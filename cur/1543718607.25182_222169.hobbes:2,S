	Generally, yes, it is. Surprisingly so. If you assume everything is
perfect, then this seems true. But in the real world, it almost never works
that way.
	Consider, for example, if process 1 is responsible for most of the memory
load at any particular time. If it's on CPU #1 and all its memory is on CPU
#1, then the memory controller on CPU #2 is underused and memory bandwidth
suffers. This is why most BIOSes interlave the memory pages across the CPUs.
This gives you the best chance of being able to use both memory controllers
under load.
	I don't think we've reached the point yet where treating x86-64 systems as
NUMA machines makes very much sense.
