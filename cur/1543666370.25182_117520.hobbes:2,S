	If there was, they'd be fixed.
I get bit by the AS bugs on recent -mm kernels. It is reproducible every
time I start X. Here are a few points to my setup that might help
someone to reproduce the problem.
1. My home dir is on a LVM striped LV across two IDE disks.
2. Recently I had modified my .xinitrc like this:
	# Nice smooth X under load
	#sudo /usr/bin/renice -10 $(pgrep -u root X)
	exec gnome-session
I have confirmed that removing the renice allows X/gnome to progress
further through the startup.
