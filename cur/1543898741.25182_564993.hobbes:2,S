How many drivers will be adversely affected by the $subject change.

I'm not talking about USB.

Me too.

They are mostly related to kernel threads, that we've already agreed no to
freeze (except for the ones that want that, but they will be responsible for
getting everything right).  The initial patches for that are in -mm and more
will come.

See above.  We're moving away from freezing kernel threads.

No we don't.
Still, my position is this:
1) The freezer (in the modified form, with the freezing of kernel threads
limited to the ones that want to be frozen) is needed for hibernation.
2) The freezer is generally not needed for suspend, _but_ there are drivers
in the tree that rely on it being used.  Thus, at some point in time we can
remove the freezer from the suspend code path, _but_ no sooner than we are
sure that the majority of drivers is prepared for that.
3) In the meantime, if there are freezer-related problems, they should be
fixed rather than used as arguments for immediate removal of it, because of 2).

Rafael
