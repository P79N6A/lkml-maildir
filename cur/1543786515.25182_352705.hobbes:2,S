btw, where can I get the latest sparse release?
linux-2.6.14-rc2/Documentation/sparse.txt still points to a dead
directory at
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/projects/git-snapshots/sparse/
which now seems to be 404.
Are there no snapshots available?  Didn't anyone convre the bitkeeper
repository to git or something else?  I'm a bit puzzled.
Thanks!
