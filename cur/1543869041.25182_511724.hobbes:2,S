There should be no files appearing under /sys/class/lcd, so thats all
normal. There is another report with similar symptoms which also sounds
like enabling the following options are at fault:
# CONFIG_FB_RIVA_BACKLIGHT is not set
# CONFIG_FB_RADEON_BACKLIGHT is not set
I suspect these options only work on certain hardware and aren't
generic. James, any idea what hardware these do/don't work with?
Worst case, we set them to depend on PMAC_BACKLIGHT again I guess...
