When system boots with no  USB device plugged in everything works OK until
the moment I plug a USB device. In that very moment the system freezes with 
message
"input: USB HID v1.00 Keyboard [BTC USB Keyboard] on usb2:3.0"
as reported before.
As you suggested I've also tried the vanila kernel without the XFS patch 
without any difference. System remains hanging.
Any idea?
Thank you very much.
