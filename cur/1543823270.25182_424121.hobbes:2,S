Yes I realise that, the test patches in my tree will hand back a shared
one but hand back the status so you know you asked for exclusive, got
shared and need to decide.

It would certainly be a lot cleaner than this sort of code in the pcmcia
core right now. Want me to send a patch which only allows for SA_SHIRQ
and WARN_ON()'s for any driver not asking for shared IRQ ?
