Correct.
Currently by using pids internally we are not correctly refcounted
against reuse.  Nor in the process group case do we even have an
object off of which we can hang a reference count.
In the case of a multiple instances of a process space the problem
is much more acute as we must properly ref count the pid space as
well.
Now to further make this fun we have variables like spawnpid in 
drivers/char/vt_ioctl.c and drivers/char/keyboard.c that
persist indefinitely.  Which cause problems for most traditional
reference counting techniques.
Further in cases where the references persist indefinitely we don't
want to pin the task_struct in memory indefinitely even after
the task has exited and it's zombie has been reaped.
So how do we solve this problem?
There are two possible approaches I can see to solving this problem.
1) Use a non-pointer based kpid and simply accept identifier
   wrap-around problems with kpids just like we currently accept
   these problems with pids.
2) Implement weak references for kpids.
Semantically a weak reference is a pointer that becomes NULL when the
object it refers to goes away.
A couple days ago I conducted an experiment, to see if I could
implement this in the kernel and surprisingly it is fairly straight
forward to do.  First you define a weak kpid as a kpid with a
list_head attached, and whenever you setup a weak kpid you
register it with the pid hash table.  
Then in detach_pid when the last reference to the pid goes away, you
walk the list of weak kpids and you NULL the appropriate entries.
This seems to solve the reference counting problem neatly and
without needing to disturb the logic of the existing code.  Even
outside the context of multiple pid spaces then I think weak
kpids are desirable.
Thoughts?

Walk the list of weak kpids here.
