Subject: [PATCH] remove device mapper max_sectors restriction
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The maximum size of a bio is restricted by DM to BLK_DEF_MAX_SECTORS
although the I/O size can be increased for each member device above this
value by using the /sys/block/queue/max_sectors interface.
IMHO the limitation when loading the dm table is unnecessary, the values
for sub-devices are checked while set through the sysfs interface and
the restrictions of the sub-devices are combined, the minimal values are
used for the DM queue. Chopping this additionally to BLK_DEF_MAX_SECTORS
makes it impossible to use IOs bigger than 512KB on big RAIDs accessed
through multipath, even if the devices may support them. The trivial patch
removes this limitation. Sub-devices' max_sectors need to be set before
creating the DM device.
Patch is against 2.6.24. For older kernels max_hw_sectors needs to be set
additionally.
