Here is a patch that revert default cache_hot_time value back to the equivalence
of pre-domain scheduler, which determins task's cache affinity via architecture
defined variable cache_decay_ticks.
This is a mere request that we go back to what *was* before, *NOT* as a new
scheduler tweak (Whatever tweak done for domain scheduler broke traditional/
industry recognized workload).
As a side note, I'd like to get involved on future scheduler tuning experiments,
we have fair amount of benchmark environments where we can validate things across
various kind of workload, i.e., db, java, cpu, etc.  Thanks.
