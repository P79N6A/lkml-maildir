I agree, and that's what I do.
The problem is, the API change is still in my tree.  So, if for example,
the IB tree goes and adds some new functionality before my API changes
have landed, they need to use the "old" API in order for them to be able
to test and build things on their own.  Then, when the -next tree merges
everything together, the IB tree breaks the build, not my driver tree.
It's those "who goes first" type things that end up being the cause of a
lot of Andrew's headaches I think :)
