Yep.

I think we do care, yes. It could be pretty harmful to sleep for
even a few 10s of ms on a regular basis for some workloads. Although
I guess many of those will be covered by try_to_wake_up events...
Not sure in practice, I would imagine it will hurt some multiprocessor
workloads.

3. This is exactly one of the situations that the balancing backoff code
    was designed for. Can you just schedule interrupts to fire when the
    next balance interval has passed? This may require some adjustments to
    the backoff code in order to get good powersaving, but it would be the
    cleanest approach from the scheduler's point of view.
