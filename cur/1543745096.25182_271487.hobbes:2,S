It looks like it is only held very briefly during the early parts of do_umount.
I have moved lock_kernel() as above in addition to the two patches you pointed
to earlier.  This has left me with a system which has 21M inodes and undetectable
delays during heavy mount/umount activity.  I am starting one last test which
attempts a umount of a filesystem which has many inodes associated with it.
At this point, I have checked the entire code path and see no reason the
BKL is held for the first call to invalidate_inodes.
