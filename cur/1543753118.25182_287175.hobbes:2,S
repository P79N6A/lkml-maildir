I think I agree, also with doing it at the VFS layer. We must make sure that 
eventually the most recent timestamp makes it to disk (unless the machine 
crashes, in which case slightly out-of-date timestamps probably can be 
tolerated).

Yes. Actually zeroing out the upper two bits is wrong for timestamps before 
the epoch if we use plain two's complement representation. The two bits give 
us an extended range of about [1697 .. 2242] instead of [1901 .. 2038].
