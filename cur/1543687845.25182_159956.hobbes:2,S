Oh yes. The core is most definitely P6+tweaks and not NetBurst.
This can be deduced from facts like:
- CPUID family is 6 not 15
- performance counter architecture is like PIII with some minor
  tweaks but definitely nothing like P4
- treated separately from NetBurst in code optimization manual
The reason compiling with -march=pentium4 doesn't break is that
the differences ISA-wise are almost nil.
