Subject: 2.2.0pre3 won't mount my FAT32 partitions

I have 3 FAT32 partitions:
/dev/hda2   *         2      439  3518235    b  Win95 FAT32
/dev/hda5           440      637  1590403+   b  Win95 FAT32
/dev/hdc2           262      699  3518235    b  Win95 FAT32
They all have 4K clusters.  I am unable to mount any of them under
2.2.0-pre3:
[root@gecko /root]# mount -t vfat /dev/hda2 /mnt/hda2
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hda2,
       or too many mounted file systems
[root@gecko /root]# tail -2 /var/log/messages
Jan  2 18:44:34 gecko kernel: fat_read_super: Bad fsinfo_offset
Jan  2 18:44:34 gecko kernel: VFS: Can't find a valid MSDOS filesystem
on dev 03:02.
I get the same errors for all 3 partitions.
Howerver, I am able to mount VFAT floppies.
