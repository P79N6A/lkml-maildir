If your drive needs a forced eject to interrupt it's firmware from
trying to read a disc, it has problems.

I find that mounting a cdrom will either suceed or fail within a few
minutes on any hardware I have ever bought.  My hardware seems to tell
the OS that it can't read the disc.  I have seen cheap drives that
seemed to just keep trying forever and were essentially unable to be
interrupted.  I don't buy that kind of hardware.
Check if your drive firmware is actually up to date.  If not, update it.
Maybe the company making the drive has fixed their mistakes.
