Yip, I'd prefer to leave it up to the user on what one exactly wants
fair or non-fair wakeup.

But what about compatibility with i368, no cmpxchg or cmpxchg8b
Can't we have to types and infer from the op in the kernel what

Keeping it small, allows for the common case of mutex integration into data
objects, though its not a big deal.
