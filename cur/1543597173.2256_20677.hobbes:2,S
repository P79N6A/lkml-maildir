It may have been corrupted by the hang/crash.  This is why using
a serial console is *always* the best bet for tracking down these
kinds of issues.

The messages are printed to the console and, if syslogd is running,
will be recorded in /var/log/messages.  However, there is always
a delay between the error being printed and syslogd getting that
text to disk.  A serial console doesn't have this problem.

I'll let you know when I see the messages. ;-)
