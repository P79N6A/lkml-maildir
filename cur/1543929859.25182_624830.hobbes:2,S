I did.  There is only 1 subsystem.  That's easy to change.
drivers/mtd/ubi/debug.c:  print_hex_dump(KERN_DEBUG, "", DUMP_PREFIX_OFFSET, 32, 1,
drivers/mtd/ubi/io.c:     print_hex_dump(KERN_DEBUG, "", DUMP_PREFIX_OFFSET, 32, 1,
Long lines in the log file are not too easy to read anyway.
Using 16 byte dumps per line instead of 32 isn't painful.
It gets rid of the allocation, reduces the argument count
and makes the kernel smaller.  I think it's all good.
Every current caller would have to change though.
