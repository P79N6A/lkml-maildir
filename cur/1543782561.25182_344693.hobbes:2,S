It is eliminated.  As the result, the compile-time checks disappear.
In this case it's more or less harmless - we miss some bugs that could
be caught at compile time, but that's it.  In case of e.g. xchg() (same
technics of calling undefined function in the code that gets eliminated
if everything's right) it gave genuine bugs - gcc decided to create an
uninlined copy and to hell it went:
static inline unsigned long
__xchg(volatile void *ptr, unsigned long x, int size)
{
        switch (size) {
                case 1:
                        return __xchg_u8(ptr, x);
                case 2:
                        return __xchg_u16(ptr, x);
                case 4:
                        return __xchg_u32(ptr, x);
                case 8:
                        return __xchg_u64(ptr, x);
        }
        __xchg_called_with_bad_pointer();
        return x;
}
#define xchg(ptr,x)                                                          \
  ({                                                                         \
     __typeof__(*(ptr)) _x_ = (x);                                           \
     (__typeof__(*(ptr))) __xchg((ptr), (unsigned long)_x_, sizeof(*(ptr))); \
  })
blows to hell, since we have no way to tell gcc that it should _never_
be done non-inlined.  Well, no way short of making __xchg a macro...
So what do you propose to use for that class of compile-time checks?
#define whenever they are used?
