This will be a separate patch against the I-pipe, adding the missing bits to
support what emc and the like need, in order to run the real-time extension they
rely on. The I-pipe patch series consists of largely reworked Adeos patches only
retaining the interrupt pipeline code from its ancestor. We need a few other
things to support what those real-time extension need to fully cooperate with
Linux (which goes beyond just interposing on interrupts actually).
