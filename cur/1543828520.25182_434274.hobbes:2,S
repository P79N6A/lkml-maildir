I saw a crash in 2.6.17-rc6-mm2 in the NFS code, w/ stack trace

which was passed a NULL pointer. This was on PowerPC. 
It appears that the patch of Tue, 13 Jun 2006 14:13:36 -0700 (PDT)
from Christoph Lameter seems to fix the probelm for me, after
some light testing. 
That is, the patch posted at  
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/13/210
So -- thanks -- and please add the appropriate Signed-Off-bys to 
that patch and get it upstream!
