Don't allow the change_page_attr if page->count > 1 is an easy solution,
and it probably suffices.  Beyond that anything mmaped can be found
by walking into the backing address space, and then through the
vm_area_structs found with i_mmap && i_mmap_shared.  Of course the
vm_area_structs may possibly need to break because of the multiple
page protections.

Using pgprot_t to convey the cacheablity of a page appears to be an
abuse.  At the very least we need a PAGE_CACHE_MASK, to find just
the cacheability attributes.
And we should really consider using the other cacheability page
attributes on x86, not just cache enable/disable.  Using just mtrr's
is limiting in that you don't always have enough of them, and that
sometimes valid ram is mapped uncacheable, because of the mtrr
alignment restrictions.
