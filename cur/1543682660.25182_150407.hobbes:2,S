The tags means that each file gets modified for each tag and then we have
to transfer the whole tree after a tag.  It thrashes the hell out of the
disk too, for no good reason.
Also note that there are nowhere near as many tags as there are commits
in the CVS tree.  So by using tags you are restricting yourself to coarse
granularity in your bug hunts.
