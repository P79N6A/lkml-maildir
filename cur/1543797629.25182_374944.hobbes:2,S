btw., here's my SLOB wishlist:
 - would be nice to have DEBUG_SLOB - people want to debug their memory 
   allocations, no matter which allocator they use.
 - would be nice to have CONFIG_SLOB_INFO, to have /proc/slabinfo for 
   those who are ready to pay the .text price for it - this is nice for 
   memory leak debugging, etc. [should be /proc/slabinfo, not 
   /proc/slobinfo - to stay compatible with things like slabtop]
