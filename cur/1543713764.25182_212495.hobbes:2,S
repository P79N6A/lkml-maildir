 I think we need to separate the chipset driver from the 
implementation-specific details.  There are at least three configurations 
in existence:
1. DECstation on-board serial ports for the 3100 (2100) and the 5000/200 
(there are minor differences which can be handled together, I think).
2. The PMAC-A TURBOchannel board.  This implies up to 24 ports in a single
system if we ever support the DEC 3000/900 (3000/800) Alpha systems; 16
ports otherwise. ;-)
3. VAX-based systems -- you know the details better.
Note the existence of #2 above implies there may be two different kinds of
such ports in a single system, be it a DECstation or a VAXstation (the
4000 series use these ports as well, don't they?).

 It sounds like a plan. :-)
