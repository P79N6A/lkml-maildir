reset/clear CMOS with jumper. I get this kind of instability each time
I have to boot to win9x (with latest and greatest via drivers) and back
to linux. Just of sudden linux freezes or if I have apcid running 
sometimes it oops' on boot sometimes later ... lots of defunc  kacpid ...
threads.
looks like VIA drivers do something to hardware (or maybe only ACPI part
of hardware ... I don't know.) and linux can't handle hardware is this
new "after win9x" state ... 
reset/clear CMOS with jumper helped.
