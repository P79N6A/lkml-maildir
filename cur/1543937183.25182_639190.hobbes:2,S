Well, it was a name from the caller point of view :)  You basically
merged do_filp_open and open_namei.  Given that open_namei was an
internal helper only used by do_filp_open it seems quite sensible to
keep the existing do_filp_open user interface and call the merged
function do_filp_open.  Especially as filp_open is a quite descriptive
name of what we're doing here - open the pathname and return a file
pointer for it.
