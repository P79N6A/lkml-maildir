Indeed is weird. Are you sure you keyboard is generating an UTF-8
enconded "ö"? Just check it with echo:
$ echo -n ö | od -t x1
0000000 c3 b6 
0000002
I'm using kernel 2.6.9 + Chris patch

I know :)). By the way, and this is offtopic, have you checked uim? I
was testing it the other day with good results, and like it a lot as
a japanese (or another script, although i only use this japanese) input 
method. I've used it with anthy, just have to check it with skk.
