I'm guessing
static inline unsigned read_seqbegin const seqlock_t *sl)
{
        unsigned ret = sl->sequence;
        smp_rmb();
        return ret;
}
Should Be....
static inline unsigned read_seqbegin(const seqlock_t *sl)
{
        unsigned ret = sl->sequence;
        smp_rmb();
        return ret;
}
