I believe Thomas is concerned about workloads that need a short-term
stable timebase.  For example, a process-control application might need
to accurately measure a (say) 1500-millisecond time interval.  Both
user-programmability and NTP adjustments to a given timebase could
destroy the needed measurement accuracy.
Such a workload does not need the long-term tie to wallclock time that
NTP provides, but it does need the accurate short-term timekeeping that
NTP cannot provide -- NTP sacrifices short-term accuracy in order to
adjust the clock as needed to gain long-term stability.
Thomas, John, please jump in if I am missing the point here.
						Thanx, Paul
