Hi,
I have been looking at the CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU option
in the Linux Kernel. The option works for IA64, PPP64,
S390 architectures. I am doing my research on SMT
architecture and want to write a kernel module that
can dynamically enable/disable SMT, so that I can
switch between uniprocessor mode and SMT mode. So is
it possible to use the CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU option to
dynamically enable/disable a logical processor by
performing a logical removal of the CPU since the
hardware does not support CPU hotplugging? Also I
would like to know how efficient such an
implementation would be? 
I would really appreciate if anyone could provide me
suggestions and any specific patches related to this
work.
Regards,
Jayush.
