	*smirk* How horrible. I'm not sure you should be proud of supporting
this, and certainly not proud of only half-supporting it. It wouldn't work
reliably as things are now as packets will always follow the ARP reply
generated by the very first packet.
	If you want to facilitate this sort of network, you'd need to cache
an ARP reply for an IP number against BOTH the Interface AND the interface
address used as the source of the ARP request. Only then could you guarantee
that packets go to the correct IP number out of the correct interface based
on their source address.
