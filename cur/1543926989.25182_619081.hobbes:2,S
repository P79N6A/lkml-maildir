Hi,
   Would like some advices on how to debug a driver which causes a
processes to go into
uninterruptible sleep.
Am trying to debug a  bug which makes my video driver to go into
an sleep/busywaiting. (when i do 'ps -l' find a 'D' in the stat field).
99% of the time the driver works,
However when i try to run both the video and the audio driver.(streaming
 audio and video)
The video driver sometimes goes into busywaiting/sleep.
My driver contains lots of spinlocks and semaphores. I have no clue on how to
solve this issues.
Please do advice,
Regards,
sriram
