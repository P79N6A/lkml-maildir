OK, the view on this seems to change frequently
and depends on who you are talking to, so I'm
never sure which way to go on a particular day.
My preference was to have a single patch, but the
view that patches absolutely must be broken into
tiny pieces even if the pieces make no sense
on their own seems to pop up a lot.

DMA memory (descriptors and data buffers for the rings)
are allocated with pci_alloc_consistent().

Yes, it is both a tty and net (generic hdlc) driver. The hardware
is synchronous and asynchronous and can be used for normal async tty,
hdlc tty, or hdlc networking.

Crap

These are left over from a vain attempt to decouple the
driver from the kernel API change du jour (as per
your previous comment). I will remove them.

hmmmm, if that is the latest style then I'll change it.

It enforces proper endian handling, field access,
and bit positions. As you say, it is more reliable.
It also makes the code more readable for me.

OK

There is no return code in the API to indicate error.
The caller should monitor the write room before calling.
There is really nothing this function can do if too
much data is blindly pushed at it.

I read them every Sunday. Ha.
I'll fix it.

It is done so if the handler is already running,
no attempt is made to schedule or run it again.

There probably will be a cardbus version.
The definition of that register does not guarantee that
0xffffffff won't happen in normal operation.
But I can add a check to a different register as a
hardware present check similar to the synclink_cs
driver for the 16-bit PCMCIA card.

hmmm, I want to ponder that some and review how often it is used
I've always though that get_signals_locked() type wrappers
were ugly, but if it saves significant code size it make sense.

This is the 32 bit physical bus address passed to the hardware
in the descriptor. The hardware DMA engine does not handle
64 bit addresses. The type should be changed to _u32 though.

This one driver will (hopefully) handle all the variants of
this family which may or may not share the same flag settings.
Future kernel changes may add or remove more flags which may
or may not apply to a particular variant.
I would prefer to leave it in place now rather than
having to add it back in later to accommodate such changes.

It does a lot, but I've worked to reduce the size as much
as possible. It is an improvement over the original synclink
driver, which is a little crufty after being dragged through
the kernel over the last 8 years.
