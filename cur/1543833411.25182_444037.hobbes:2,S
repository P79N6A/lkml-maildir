Yes.  Once you figure out which one you want the concept and get an
irq using the in the driver is the same.  The driver does need to be
aware of the details so it knows which interrupt it is generating though.

And I tested it on one of them.  The problem is that there is no API in
the kernel for properly handling hypertransport interrupts or even faking
it well currently.  There is no shame in breaking a bad unmaintainable
hack, as I did.  The responsible thing is to when you find one to
fix up the code so that things work by design in a maintainable way,
which I am attempting to do.

All existing drivers that use HT interrupts are broken by design.
Nor do out of tree kernel drivers count, because the authors
are not working with the community.  I can almost use the fact
that the code breaks out of tree drivers as an argument for mainstream
kernel inclusion.

Sure.  In that case can I please have a good description of what
weird hacks your hardware designers have done.  As I understand
it I cannot write to the standard registers HT capability registers
and have things work correctly.

Until you have time to look and think about this I'm not prepared
to discuss this.  All I did was add code to work with the standard
ht irq capability.

msi and msi-x are different, so to is ht.  There is no real commonality
there.

The functions I exported I intend to export.  The complaint seems to
be that you don't have anything that will work on earlier kernels.
I have to agree you don't.
