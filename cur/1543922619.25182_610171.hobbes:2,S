That's what I mean -- disabling it for memory. I mean, I am just
talking about the conditional => unconditional store to a shared
variable optimisation.
So for example, adc, sbb, and cmov are all still fine when they
are used for the right things. I don't want to turn them off
because they really are quite useful.
As far as it being theoretical... I hope it is. But we should
nip this in the "bud" (gcc 3.x does this too, sigh) before it
causes problems for us (and any and all other threaded programs
and libraries out there). And by that I mean ask them for a
compiler option rather than start adding volatile.
