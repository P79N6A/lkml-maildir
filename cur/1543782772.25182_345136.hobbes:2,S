It would be better if it wasn't, though.
I really don't see why we made it irq-safe, and take the hit of disabling
interrupts in addition to the locking.  That's a quite noticeable loss,
and I don't think it's really a valid thing to insert (or look up) page
cache entries from interrupts.
What _is_ it that makes us do that, btw? Is it just because we clear the 
writeback tag bits or something? Sad. It makes page lookup noticeably more 
expensive.
