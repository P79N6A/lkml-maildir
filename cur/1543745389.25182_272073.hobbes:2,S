Well can we at least stick a comment in there explaining to the
long-suffering reader what the difference is between smp_processor_id(),
_smp_processor_id() and __smp_processor_id()?  And what the architecture's
options are?
Or should we go through every arch and rename their smp_processor_id() to
__smp_processor_id()?  That would make sense, and would simplify that piece
of code.
