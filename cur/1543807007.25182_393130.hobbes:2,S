No, it is not hardwired. There's special swap support, but you do not
need to use it.

Doing full image is certainly possible; it is not important if kernel
does the writing or userspace does it. Taking patches definitely
depends how they'd look like...

As far as I can see, transfering data to userspace and back does not
really cost much:
pavel@amd:~$ time head -c $[1024*1024*1024] < /dev/zero > /dev/null
0.16user 0.27system 0.43 (0m0.439s) elapsed 100.00%CPU
...2000MB/sec is the limit (thinkpad x32).
