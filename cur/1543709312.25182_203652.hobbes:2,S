It's not a matter of working: it's a matter of recovering. A bad disk
block could potentially destroy a file or a directory, but shouldn't
make a filesystem not mountable nor recoverable.

The problem is that I couldn't save anything: the XFS volume refused to
mount and the XFS recovery tools refused to fix anything. It was just a
single disk bad block. For example in ext2/3 critical parts are
replicated several times over the volume, so there's minimal chance of
being unable to mount the volume and recover important files.
