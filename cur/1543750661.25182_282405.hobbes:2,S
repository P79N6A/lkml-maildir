And there you have my largest complaint with the new model. If 2.6 is 
stable, it should not have existing features removed just because 
someone has a new wet dream about a better but incompatible way to do 
things. I expect working programs to be deliberately broken in a 
development tree, but once existing features are removed there simply is 
no stable set of features.

The stable and development kernel model worked for a decade, partly 
because people could build on a feature set and not have that feature 
just go away, leaving the choice of running without fixes or not 
running. Since we manage to support 2.2 and 2.4 (and perhaps even 2.0?) 
I don't see why the definition of "stable" can't simply mean "no 
deletions from the feature set" and let new features come in for those 
who want them. Absent that 2.4 will be the last stable kernel, in the 
sense that features won't be deliberately broken or removed.
