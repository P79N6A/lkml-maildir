Here's a patch that adds the inter-partition Virtual Ethernet driver for 
newer IBM iSeries and pSeries systems:
http://www-124.ibm.com/linux/patches/ppc64/ibmveth.patch
The patch applies against the 2.4.25-pre6 tree...
Jeff, can you formally add this driver to 2.4?... I'm waiting for some
ppc64 architectural addition to send out the driver for 2.6...
Comments and suggestions are always welcome...
