Good question.  I think the current behaviour is just wrong.  What the
effect of changing it will be is hard to predict - probably little.

That's one workload which is particularly susceptible to the problemn which
that patch addresses, yes.  But in my (brief) testing it didn't make musch
difference.

Yes, it'll work as designed with reiserfs.

Sounds good, yes.
Or you could do something more real-worldly like start up OO, firefox and
friends, then run /etc/cron.daily/everything and see what the
before-and-after effects are.  The aggregate info we're looking for is
captured in /proc/meminfo: swapped, Mapped, Cached, Buffers.
