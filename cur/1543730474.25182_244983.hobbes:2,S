CIFS (the network protcol) has no way to make network requests by inode
number.  In addition the cifs vfs generates inode numbers on the client
system since we can not trust that the ones returned by the server will
always be unique.   So while inode numbers might be unique on the local
client system they would not be much good on the server which may have
multiple mounts to other e.g. AFS or NFS servers (exported under a
single SMB/CIFS share (and there is no easy way to guarantee universal
unique inode numbers across a network with multiple servers in which
servers export directories that span across multiple server volumes). 
If the protocol were extended there might be a way to combine the
server's inode number with a volume UUID that could be used for inode #
based requests - if servers were upgraded to add such a feature.  In any
case for CIFS it is far easier for us to deal with the file name
(dentries) or an open file instance (file struct) as we do now. 
If the interface changes to passing in only the inodes, I would have to
either find an instance of an open file associated with the inode or
find a dentry associated with the inode in order to be able to build a
request to send to the server.  Dentries or open file instances are
easiest for CIFS.
