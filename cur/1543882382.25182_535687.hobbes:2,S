Well, in fact, the database could _be_ (a parsed version of) the current 
MAINTAINERS file; it's already in a strict, parseable format. I know that 
MAINTAINERS itself is not very good at staying up to date, but making more 
intensive use of it like that might in fact improve that...
Being able to have "modinfo module" then point at a specific link would 
require a bit more though. It could be agreed upon to, say, have a module 
that the kernel installs as
	/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/cdrom/mitsumi.ko
have a maintainer page at
	
http://www.kernel.org/maintainer/driver/cdrom/mitsumi.html
but to generate that page, the maintainer file would then need to grow a way 
to associate the "MITSUMI CDROM DRIVER" entry (don't bother, it's not there) 
in the MAINTAINERS file with that page (and simply listing that install path 
in the entry isn't good -- I believe you would wan't to pin down a structure 
like that).
Anyways -- might all also be a bit of overkill anyway. If I can get those 
email adresses from MODULE_AUTHOR out of the way, I'm mostly happy.
Rene.
