Yes. You could try the objrmap patches, they are supposed to help. They
may be in -mm, I'm not sure.

I think this is due to the extra TCP debugging, but it might be
something else. To disable the debugging, remove the setting of 
NETIF_F_TSO in linux/drivers/net/loopback.c, and re-test:
        /* Current netfilter will die with oom linearizing large skbs,
         * however this will be cured before 2.5.x is done.
         */
        dev->features          |= NETIF_F_TSO;

I doubt it. But there might be some more overhead somewhere. You should
also run lmbench at least three times to get some feeling for the
variance of the numbers, it can be quite big.

I don't think so, there's something strange with the lmbench pagefault
tests, it only has one significant digit of accuracy, and I don't even
know what it is testing. Because of the single lack of precision, it's
hard to tell what the real change is.

See if the NETIF_F_TSO change makes any difference. If performance is
still bad, holler.
