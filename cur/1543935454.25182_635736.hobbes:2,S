I think there's a little race here.  We could have several users racing
to get to this point when nr_user_mounts==max_user_mounts-1.  One user
wins the race and gets their mount reserved.  The others get the error
out of reserve_user_mount(), and return.
But, the winner goes on to error out on some condition further down in
clone_mnt() and never actually instantiates the mount.
Do you think this is a problem?
I think just about the one solution is to block new mounters on a
sleepable lock until the race winner actually finishes their mount
operation.
