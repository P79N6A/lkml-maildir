This is a huge burdon to put on people.
The more broken stuff you merge, the more people are forced to track
these problems down so that they can get their own work done.
It punishes people who do put forth the effort to let new changes cook
properly, before pushing, and thus avoid putting turds into the tree.
You really have to think about the ramifications of this system.
