I know, but what I'm getting at is that ARCH_PFN_OFFSET may be unnecessary 
with flatmem-relax-requirement-for-memory-to-start-at-pfn-0.patch applied. 
ARCH_PFN_OFFSET is used as
#define page_to_pfn(page)       ((unsigned long)((page) - mem_map) + \
                                  ARCH_PFN_OFFSET)
because it knew that the map may not start at PFN 0. With 
flatmem-relax-requirement-for-memory-to-start-at-pfn-0.patch, the map will 
start at PFN 0 even if physical memory does not start until later.
