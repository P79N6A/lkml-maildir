I've had good luck with the Intel e1000 on copper and the SysKonnect
SK-98xx on fiber, attached to Cisco and Foundry hardware.  No problems
and good performance so far.  We're running SysKonnects on GigE IDS
boxes, so they've been taking a pounding.
I've been grabbing the e1000 driver from Intel's site, and I'm using the
in-kernel SysKonnect driver with a patch to enable the Dual-NIC model.
