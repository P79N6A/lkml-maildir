Maybe it's possible to handle the "innocent, normal" case with almost
no overhead, independent from the final algorithm to prevent directory
cycles. Even if hard-linking directories are possible, the "innocent,
normal" user will unlikely mess with hard-linking directories. So the
typical situation will be, that the sysadmin occasionally does some
magic with it (like linking /usr/X11 and /usr/X11R6), but most user
trees will not contain any multi-parented directory.
The directories could be classified following:
Simple:
	- The directory has a single parent
	- All subdirectories are simple
Semi-simple:
	- The directory has multiple parents
	- All subdirectories are simple
Hairy:
	- At least one subdirectory is hairy or semi-simple
To maintain this state, each directory should maintain a counter of
hairy/semi-simple subdirectories.
The advantage of this is, that an operation on a simple/semi-simple
directory needs only to check/modify the simple ancestors plus the
first hairy/semi-simple ancestor. These ancestors are already in the
dcache, as they are required to reach the directory/target_directory.
So the critical code need only deal with the hairy directories.
But still the hairy case is ... hairy.
As I am not a fs expert, I don't know which kinds of DoS attacks could
occur. So I would like to ask, if an O(number of ancestors) solution
could be acceptable if
	- Only one ancestor is locked at a time
	- All locks are released after each processed ancestor
If such a solution would be acceptable, maybe I have an idea.
