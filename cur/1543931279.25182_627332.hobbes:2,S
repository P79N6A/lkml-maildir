Ok, reading some other threads, it seems that writing all ff's will not
be a very good alternative on x86 machines where MMCONFIG sits up
there...
I suppose there is nothing totally safe that can be done, thanks to
Intel not thinking about making BARs individually enable/disable'able
(or size-able without interrupting access, among other numerous fuckups
in the PCI spec).
So if a BAR is left dangling, I think we -must- disable MEM and IO
decoding on the whole device. In fact, the whole trick of passing a
bitmask of required BARs to pci_enable_device_bars() in the first place
doesn't fly.
Yuck.
