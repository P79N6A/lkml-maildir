	Hmmm. I didn't take that into consideration. But at the
same time, shouldn't a VM be able to determine that its cache
strategy is causing _more_ (absolute) misses by increasing it 
cache size? The percentage of misses may go down, but total 
device I/O may stay the same.
	So let's see... I'll rephrase that 'Motiviation' as:
	* Minimize the total medium/slow I/Os that occur over a 
	  sliding window of time. 
	Is that a more general case?

	First, I would like to translate them into measurements.
Once we know how to measure these criteria, its possible to
formalize the feedback mechanism/accounting that a VM should
be aware of.
	In the end, I would like a VM to have some idea of
how well its performing, and be able to attempt various
well-known strategies based upon its own performance.
