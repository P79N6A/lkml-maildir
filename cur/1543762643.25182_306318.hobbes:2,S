hi, 
i'm working on a P4 2.8 DualCore System with a vanilla 2.6.11.5 kernel. 
here's the problem kernel is hanging after the Checking for 'hlt'
instruction line. 
actually i've exprienced this happening with old systems but not with a
new one. 
haven't started debugging yet maybe someone has experinced the same
issue. 
greetz, 
mingy
p.s.: i know this mail doesn't sound linux geeky but i would be glad for
any response :)
