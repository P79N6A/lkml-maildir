Just FYI... the preemptible kernel depends on non-preemptible critical regions
denoted by spinlock calls (see Robert Love's excellent summary in
Documentation/preempt-locking.txt).  Many common drivers are assumed to have
correct locking for SMP operation, but non-SMP drivers may not. I've only run
the PreK SH kernel on the Solution Engine w/Ethernet and serial, but I did not
yet check to see if additional locks might be required in drivers/char/sh-sci.c
or drivers/net/stnic.c, which are specific to SH platforms and thus not SMP-safe
otherwise.
