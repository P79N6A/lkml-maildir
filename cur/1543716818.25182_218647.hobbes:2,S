Very nice! I like the idea of moving bits to the actual drivers
a lot. It makes perfect sense to have apm workarounds in the
apm driver etc.
One thing that might be worth your while whilst you're getting
intimate with this code, would be to take a peek at the dmi
workarounds in 2.4 and make sure we didn't miss any.
I forward ported a bunch a few months back, but I'm not sure
if I got them all, and it's possible new ones were added there
that we missed in 2.6
Good work.
