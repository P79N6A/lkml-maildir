Yes.  It shows up very clearly in the log.

Oh well, I didn't really expect there to be.
Nothing in the log stands out.  Can you collect an equivalent log using a
version of uhci-hcd with the "eliminate skeleton QHs" patch reverted?  
Perhaps there will be a significant difference.  Although I doubt it...
I'm running out of ideas.  I tried doing exactly the same thing with a USB
keyboard+hub on my system, and it worked perfectly.  This suggests that
you might be seeing some weird hardware flaw that is somehow exposed by
the patch.
Can you borrow a different USB keyboard and see if it behaves the same 
way?  Or can you try using your keyboard on a different computer (one with 
UHCI)?
