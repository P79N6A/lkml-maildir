You can probably find dozens of things in the Linux kernel that have not
been proven to be safe. That means nothing.

There's no reason whatsoever to think this is unsafe. First, you can't
access the pool directly. Second, even if you could, it's mixed in securely.

This is no more precise than "imagine there's some vulnerability in the
RNG". Yes, if there's a vulnerability, then we're vulnerable.
An attacker can always (at least in principle) get the pool out of the
kernel. The RNG's design is premised on the notion that it is
computationally infeasbile to get the input entropy out of the pool. If an
attacker can watch data going into the pool, he needn't get it out of the
pool.

I agree.
