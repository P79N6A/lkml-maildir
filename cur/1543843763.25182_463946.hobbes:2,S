I just think that things should be grouped according to the function they
provide (and not their implemetation) and get_order is part of the paging
API.

You only have to include linux/log2.h in asm-generic/page.h.  Presumably
the architectures that don't use asm-generic/page.h won't want the new
implementation of get_order() either (I didn't keep the original patch).
Won't you need to include linux/log2.h in some places to get get_order(),
now?  And if I was needing the paging API, I am much more likely to look
for it in {linux,asm}/page.h than in linux/log2.h.
