Agreed. Think if a network flood happens, it looks silly to forbid the
network to allocate the free memory because somebody is supposed to own it
even if it's not using it. We try to be smart in optimizing the memory
usage and so we couldn't be sure there's enough memory for page faults.
Spotting the offender can be done with proper informations that currently
aren't available, I actually disagree with the oom killer in 2.2.15pre12.
