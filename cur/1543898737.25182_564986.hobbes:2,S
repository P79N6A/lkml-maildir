[1/1] netpoll: Fix a leak-n-bug in netpoll_cleanup()
93ec2c723e3f8a216dde2899aeb85c648672bc6b applied excessive duct tape to
the netpoll beast's netpoll_cleanup(), thus substituting one leak with
another, and opening up a little buglet :-)
net_device->npinfo (netpoll_info) is a shared and refcounted object and
cannot simply be set NULL the first time netpoll_cleanup() is called.
Otherwise, further netpoll_cleanup()'s see np->dev->npinfo == NULL and
become no-ops, thus leaking. And it's a bug too: the first call to
netpoll_cleanup() would thus (annoyingly) "disable" other (still alive)
netpolls too. Maybe nobody noticed this because netconsole (only user
of netpoll) never supported multiple netpoll objects earlier.
This is a trivial and obvious one-line fixlet.

[ Andrew, this is diffed against 2.6.22-rc7 but applies successfully to
the 2.6.22-rc6-mm1 tree also. ]
