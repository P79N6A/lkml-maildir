I have 3*72Gb HD per computer. The test is carried out both on the server,
whereby data was written directly to the harddisk, as well the test was
carried out from one of the nodes whereby data had to pass through the
ethernet.
When carrying out the test of the ethernet no problems were discovered.

OK, good idea, didn't knew this.

Someone suggested me to install the -aa patch 2.4.19rc5aa1. When running the
modified kernel all test were performed well.
Hereby I send you the output from Bonnie++. In this test I run bonnie++ on
the server, whereby it was writting directly to the 72Gb HD.
