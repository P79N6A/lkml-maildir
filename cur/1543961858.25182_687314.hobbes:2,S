I hope your job description doesn't include adding more and more
CONFIGs though.
I am sure there are lots of low hanging fruit where memory can be
saved and it's a good thing someone cares about that, but please don't
focus on the code size only. Or if you work on that don't do it 
using CONFIG or when you really add a new one find some other 
that is pointless and remove it first. 
There are simply already far too many of them and they make the 
kernel harder and harder to change.
