Looks like nobody really understands it then ;)

Nah, you are mixing up /sys/bus/* which is a flat list of busses in the
machine, with /sys/devices/* which is the hierarchical device tree.

It's probably not, then it's a matter of properly renaming the pciN entries
in /sys/devices to be /sys/devices/pciDD:NN where DD is the domain number
and NN is the first bus on this domain, or just pciDD (though I like having
the bus number there as well)
