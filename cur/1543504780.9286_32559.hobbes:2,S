Don't know if this helps, but I too have I/O problems with
kernel-2.3.12 and XF86-3.3.4 on AMD-586/133 48M.  Seems to me that the
problem is in the kernel 'cuz I also have probs from the console.  Mouse
and modem events(serial) randomly cause X to crash.  No lockup, just a
complete shutdown to console with an occasional "Unable to handle paging
request".  Haven't been able to identify any sequence of events to make
the crash repeatable.  Printing (parallel) is 'iffy' from either X or
the console.  Text files print ok but .ps files I can only print to my
deskjet.  Attempting to print a .ps file on my dot matrix fails at
random positions through the file(image).  I figure it succeeds to the
deskjet due to a larger buffer and the data gets shoved out before I/O
fails.  Maybe I'll try a larger file to the deskjet to see if it fails
too.  After a failed print job, I can remove it from the queue and start
another but the original will never finish no matter how long I leave it
in the queue; even after a reboot.
   I know this information is vague, but I never did get an oops: 
probably because the system itself doesn't crash.  I'll keep my eyes
open to see if I can find anything more concrete.
