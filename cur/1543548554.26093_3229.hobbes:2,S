Sure, but what happens if you're in a mixed client environment?
If we have a purely Linux-specific hack to ensure cache coherency,
that will still corrupt the cache on those *NIX clients that use
ordinary cache coherency checking (i.e. checking mtime + file size)
rather than cache invalidation.
There's nothing in the NLM+NFSv2+NFSv3 notes about this situation, but 
on page 77 of the latest NFSv4 draft it states:
   o    First, when a client obtains a file lock for a particular
        region, the data cache corresponding to that region (if any
        cache data exists) must be revalidated.  If the change attribute
        indicates that the file may have been updated since the cached
        data was obtained, the client must flush or invalidate the
        cached data for the newly locked region.  A client might choose
        to invalidate all of non-modified cached data that it has for
        the file but the only requirement for correct operation is to
        invalidate all of the data in the newly locked region.
-------
Making mtime a true 64-bit cookie on Linux servers would be a solution
that works on all clients.
It also avoids a lot of unnecessary cache flushing. Imagine having to
reread your entire mailbox every time you open the file whether or not
a new message has arrived. Ugh...
Cheers,
