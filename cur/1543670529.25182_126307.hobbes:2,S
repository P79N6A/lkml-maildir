Hi,
I think I undestood wich is the option that cause the error I reported,
[ ]     OSS Sequencer API
If I enable that option I get the following error
request_module: failed /sbin/modprobe -- snd-card-0. error = -16
Now my dmesg is:
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture Driver Version 0.9.2 (Thu Mar 20 13:31:57 2003 UTC).
PCI: Found IRQ 5 for device 00:0d.0
ALSA device list:
  #0: Dummy 1
  #1: Virtual MIDI Card 1
  #2: ESS Maestro3 PCI at 0x1800, irq 5
But I still not able to play _any_ sound, I don't think that it is a problem
with my init scripts because with 2.4 I have _no_ problem.
I've updated the bugzilla's bug report,
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=395
Any hint ?
Ciao,
        Paolo
