Not true, under Windoze you can create directory with name of any case
and you always get what you wanted. Thats true, I tested it right now...
So 'Test' gives you 'Test', 'test' -> 'test', and 'TEST' -> 'TEST'. What I
don't understand is, where linux does get whats in uppercase and what
is in lowercase, since something is and something is not. Names under
windows with mixed case filenames are almost everytime seen under linux
in lowercase. But sometimes not. I would characterize this much more like
'magic' than a firm rule :-)
