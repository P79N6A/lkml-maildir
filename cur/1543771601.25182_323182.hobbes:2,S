Adding to the weirdness is that it happens infrequently - most of the times it 
works fine and I see no such error messages. I have ignored it till now. I 
will see if acpi=noirq helps.

The ohci-hcd hang problem might  be related to this. (Load of ohci-hcd with a 
storage device attached to the controller always hangs machine for 2 minutes 
- hang occurs in pci_enable_device())

Most likely this is  a ACPI oddity - If BIOS was wrong it would have happened 
all the times. The above "no GSI" thing happens only some times and looks 
like that's when things won't work.

Thanks for all the pointers. I will start with acpi=noirq and see.  My BIOS 
firmware is up2date.

Mac Beer: At first, came only a 16-oz. can, but now comes in a 32-oz. 
can. Considered by many to be a "light" beer. All the cans look 
identical. When you take one from the fridge, it opens itself. The 
ingredients list is not on the can. If you call to ask about the 
ingredients, you are told that "you don't need to know." A notice on the 
side reminds you to drag your empties to the trashcan.
