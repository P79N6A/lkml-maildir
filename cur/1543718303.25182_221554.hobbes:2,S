yes, it probably will help as DMA is currently on, however, that is not
an option as I need acceptable hard drive performance. As I said, the
system worked nicely until that kernel update. If no hardware failure is
causing this, it must be a change in the kernel. I will replace the hard
disk and see if the problem disappears.
