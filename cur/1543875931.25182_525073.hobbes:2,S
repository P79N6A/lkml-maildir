Sure... although what object the event relates to is really a component of
either the socket (1 per object) or an object identifier within the event
message (1 socket with message headers). The transport, as we use it, really
isn't the object and isn't the one generating the events, it's just a well-known
listening point and serves as a nice library to insulate drivers from the
implementation.
Granted, what's being proposed now is fairly simple, so sysfs works fine.
But if you grow at all, you'll be confronted with the multiple-readers
and payload issues that we had.
