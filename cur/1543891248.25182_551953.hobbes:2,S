I think it could be greatly simplified by using symbols instead of
strings.
That is, doing cond_call(foo, func()) rather than cond_call("foo",
func()). Here foo is a structure or type holding the relevant info to
deal with the cond_call infrastructure. For unoptimized architectures,
it can simply be a bool, which will be faster.
This has the added advantage that the compiler will automatically pick
up any misspellings of these things. And it saves the space we'd use
on the hash table too.
