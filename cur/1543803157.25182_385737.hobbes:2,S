I ran the make oldconfig, then make menuconfig, and when I try to change 
the settings, it gives this message.
This feature depends on another which has been configured as  a module.
As a result,  this feature will be built as a module.
I had manually edited the .config file, and changed all =m to =y, so there is 
nothing in the file that has the module setting but these.
I placed a copy of the .config file at the link below. 
http://www.guam.net/home/mikes/bzImagez.config
Only those items with the PCMCIA and I2C_STUB have the =m.
Thanks for the reply. I'm trying to make a kernel that will suppor the most 
hardware, and avoid conflict.
