GIT was only involved in creating the raw patch, which was then
compressed with gzip, then uncompressed and directly included in vim
into a raw email message when then mutt sent out.
So, if the mime headers were wrong on the patch that I sent out, it is
mutts fault, not git.
If you are trying to apply the patch directly from somewhere else, where
did it come from?
