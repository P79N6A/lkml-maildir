Thanks!  I got the patch from
http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&m=119756785219214
(Which didn't make it into -rc7; please fix!)
and am recompiling now.
Actually, I grabbed the hardware mitigation followon patch while I was
at it.  I notice that the comment explaining the format of CSR11 and
what 0x80F10000 means got lost; perhaps it would be nice to resurrect it?
0x80F10000
  80000000 = Cycle size (timer control)
  78000000 = TX timer in 16 * Cycle size
  07000000 = No. pkts before Int. (0 =  interrupt per packet)
  00F00000 = Rx timer in Cycle size
  000E0000 = No. pkts before Int.
  00010000 = Continues mode (CM)
  
(Boy, that tulip driver could use a whitespace overhaul.)
