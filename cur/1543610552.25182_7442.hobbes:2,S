Martin,
PIIX4 AB/EB is a broken hardware mess.
HPT366 is another issue.
The newest driver should improve things but the latest unreleased fixes a
basic design error introduced some time ago by an unknown patch.  This has
been found and fixed.  Just need to find an ungreased turkey first to
test.
Regards,
Andre Hedrick
