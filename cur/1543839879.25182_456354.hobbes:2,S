Hi,
there is one issue with the "creator pays" model: if the creator can
decide to die/go away/respawn then you can create orphan resources. This
is a leak at least, but if a malicious user can control the
death/respawn cycle it can even be abused to bypass the controls in the
first place. Keeping the owner alive until all shared users are gone is
not always a good idea either; if a container significantly malfunctions
(or requires a restart due to, say, a very urgent glibc security
update), keeping it around anyway is not a valid option for the admin.
(And it forms another opportunity for a malicious user, keep a
(vulnerable) container alive by hanging on to a shared resource
deliberately)
A general "unshare me out" function that finds a new to-blame owner
might work, just the decision whom to blame is not an easy one in that
scenario.
