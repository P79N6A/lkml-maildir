Hi Andrea,
	OK, I tested your latest VM and I'm impressed :)  I have a 64MB PPro
box, and I tested a kernel compile.  This isn't the BEST test, because
it doesn't stress the VM much.  So, I got almost exactly the same times
(one or two seconds shorter out of 9m25s) as with Linus's test1-pre4. 
HOWEVER!  It used NO swap!  Here is the result of 'free' after I
compiled:
             total       used       free     shared    buffers    
cached
Mem:         63548      52600      10948      31772       6176     
24868
-/+ buffers/cache:      21556      41992
Swap:        34236          0      34236
test1-pre4, on the other hand, had used 10 Mb of swap by this point. 
BTW, I used these settings in both cases:
telomere:~> cat /proc/sys/vm/pagecache 
1       30      75
telomere:~> cat /proc/sys/vm/buffermem 
1       20      60
I am going to test the actual pre4 now.
Oh, and I have a PPro box, libc6, EIDE (4MB/s media read/write time).
