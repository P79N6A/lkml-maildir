Hmm, right. Actually, it should only try to open an IPv6 socket if
you stomp on a webserver which runs IPv6 already.

OK, if you didn't compile your kernel for an IDT WinChip, wmb() only
affects the compilers optimizer (it stops the compiler from reordering
memory writes across it, so it's effect is not changed by the if
around it in this case).

Nope, the other way round. At the moment, the wmb() in set_user() is
only done if dumpclear is set, ie. with set_user(0, 1).
But as stated above, moving the wmb() should not change anything on an
x86 (non-WinChip) machine. I think your problem is buried somewhere
else ...

... but really testing it doesn't hurt, so please proceed :-)
What you can also try is making the kernel do those module requests
without the rest of mozilla around it. Try running the following test
program a few times while you are listening to music.
---------- snip ----------
/*
 * Save as ipv6test.c and compile with "gcc -o ipv6test ipv6test.c". 
 * Run with "./ipv6test".
 */
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
        int s;
        printf("Creating IPv6 socket...");
        if ((s = socket(PF_INET6, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) != -1) {
                printf(" succeeded.\n");
                close(s);
        }
        else
                printf("failed.\nsocket: %m\n");
        return 0;
}
---------- snip ----------
If this doesn't cause skips, it seems very unlikely to me that your
skips are related to request_module() or the functions called by it.
