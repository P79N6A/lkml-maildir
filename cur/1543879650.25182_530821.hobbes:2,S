so this goes over keventd, right?

Could keventd perhaps be starved? Willy, to exclude this possibility, 
could you perhaps chrt keventd to RT priority? If events/0 is PID 5 then 
the command to set it to SCHED_FIFO:50 would be:
  chrt -f -p 50 5
but ... events/0 is reniced to -5 by default, so it should definitely 
not be starved.
