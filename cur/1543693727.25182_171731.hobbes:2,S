Sure. We might even try actually implementing leases on NFSv4 for
delegated files.

Note that this too may be a per-file property. Under NFSv4 I can
guarantee you that stat() results are correct in the case where I have
a delegation. Otherwise, you are indeed subject to inherent races.
"noac" cannot entirely resolve such races, but it sounds as if it
could in the particular cases you describe.

Err... open() should normally suffice to do that...
Unless you are simultaneously writing to the file on a remote system,
in which case you really need mandatory locking rather than NFSv2/v3's
weaker advisory model. Or possibly something like CIFS/SMB's open
"share" model (which can also be implemented in NFSv4).
...so I would argue that the caching models both can and do make a
difference to your example cases (contrary to what you assert).
Cheers,
