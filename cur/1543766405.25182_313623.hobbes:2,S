Well, I'll not say "no" just now ;-). I thought 'suspend' is nicer for
non-technical users, not being acronym.

Done.

Well, if there were no checking in check_pagedir, we could end up in
situation where some page's address == some other page's original
address. That would be really bad. This comment says it can not happen
because care was taken in check_pagedir(). Perhaps it needs to be
explained better?
