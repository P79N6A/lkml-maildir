Let me restart this discussion after about 5 months interval.

Now it seems the conversion of the i386 timer code has been finished.
We can think this topic again.  Here is a patch against current git
tree.  How about this?  And I wonder if there are any point
maintaining wall_jiffies now.  It seems jiffies and wall_jiffies are
always synced.
[PATCH] simplify update_times
In kernel 2.6, update_times() is called directly from timer interrupt,
so there is no point calculating ticks here.  This also make a barrier
added by 5aee405c662ca644980c184774277fc6d0769a84 needless.
Also adjust x86_64 timer interrupt handler with this change.
