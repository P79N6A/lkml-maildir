which all can be avoided by not using the host
context for that, but a special 'all seeing' 
context (as we have in Linux-VServer) which
can see (and probably manipulate) those interfaces
from the 'admin' PoV without entering the guest
context

applications scanning the interfaces at startup
are broken by design and should probably be
fixed instead of worked around ...

why not, would it do any harm when the hotplug
scripts on the host would take the appropriate
actions (i.e. do the required config for the guest)
for special guest interfaces?
but now that you mention it, what about hotplug
events inside the guest?

I do not consider this the best solution, especially
from the security PoV. don't forget you basically
enter the guest and execute arbitrary programs
(which might have been compromised) to do a setup
task you actually want to happen on the host
