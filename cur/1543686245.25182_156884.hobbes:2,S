Which is OK for those very familiar with the code, but not so good for anyone 
else.

Even if it is not subject to change, which can never be a total certainty, it 
will need to be applied in new code.  The greater clarity provided by the 
C-99 format will make it easier to ensure the appropriate values are put into 
the right fields.

Smaller source code is not everything.  A consistant style is also very 
important.
