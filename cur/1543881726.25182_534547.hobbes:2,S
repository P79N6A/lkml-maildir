The unix way(TM) for specifying multiple uid is...ehm.. groups :)
I will add the gid,tcp_gid and udp_gid configfs attributes in the next
release.
The 'check order' will be:
uidbind/<port>/<ip>/<proto>_uid  
uidbind/<port>/<ip>/uid
uidbind/<port>/<proto>_uid
uidbind/<port>/uid
uidbind/<port>/<ip>/<proto>_gid  
uidbind/<port>/<ip>/gid
uidbind/<port>/<proto>_gid
uidbind/<port>/gid
I am investigating the possibility of port-range use, particularly the
overlap checks and performance problems.
