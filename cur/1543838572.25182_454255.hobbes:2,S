It took 4.5 minutes to recover on my X2 3800+, 2GB RAM, 512MB swap, when I 
tried without ulimit on 2.6.18-rc4. However, the OOM killer did call all of 
the offending processes and I was able to use the machine for many hours 
afterwards. The VM didn't even mind after a swapoff -a.
Maybe an -mm patch?
