Sounds to me like you should have the /option/ to double your info,
which does not mean that the whole world should start seeing your stuff
double. You must "fool" the other trees into believing that you are the
second Mozart (you get everything right the first time around) and only
to yourself will you admit that it took 15 different tries and you
dead-ended yourself 15 different ways.  Under these conditions you would
have all your blunders documented, but only for yourself.
