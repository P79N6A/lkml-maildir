    some time ago i`ve posted patch to fix adlib 
  module region leak. the patch got rejected, but
  somewhat later i`ve completely realised the 
  ridiculousness of the existence of this code.
    why does adlib_card.c still exists?
  AFAICS its an wrapper to opl3 functions which ones
  fully support adlib (opl1).
  i think it`s even argued that x_ADLIB config option
  should exist, because it adds nothing more than
  this wrapper (in fact it even depends on opl3.h)...
  so i think the solution is to completely remove
  "adlib support"...
  am i wrong?
