The last time NFS was working, I had 2.4.19 and 2.5.53 clients on a 
2.5.59 server, that was yesterday.  I had experienced a slight problem 
with it last week when my 2.5.53 client was booted for first time on 
2.5.5x, it was previously a 2.4 kernel.  The server OOPSed repeatedly 
shortly after bootup in NFS stuff then it never happened again and was 
rock solid until today.
