No.  Linus' proposal was shouted down.
What is happening is that Linus will continue to release 2.6.x as usual, 
with no even/odd stuff.
Then a review committee will maintain 2.6.x.y (where y starts at 1 and 
increments).  This will contain obvious fixes against 2.6.x.  When Linus 
comes out with 2.6.x+1, then they will start a new stable tree 2.6.x+1.y.
Please see the thread entitled "[RFC] -stable, how it's going to work.", 
started by Greg KH for more information on the "stable" release process.
