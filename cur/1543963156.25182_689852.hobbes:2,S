I'm don't think all of this code should move.
In particular, parts of prom_parse.c dealing with irqs handle virtual
irqs in a powerpc specific way.
I also think ifdef PPC_PSERIES and PPC_64 and PPC_32 in prom.c are
indicative of the fact that alot of this is dealing with
architecture-specific issues.
Probably some parts of these files, but it's going to take some tweezing
to figure out what parts.
