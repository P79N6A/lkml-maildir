I _highly_ suspect that this is not a 2.4 bug but is instead user error.
I've seen it several times.
On all kernel versions prior to 2.3.11 if you compiled with the CPU set
to a newer model then you had (for instance, of you selected "Pentium Pro"
and you actually had a 486) you would get a kernel that worked fine albiet
not optimally.  On kernels 2.3.11 you will have an unbootable kernel.
Decklin - please try to reproduce this with CONFIG_M386.  Also you might
try looking in /proc/cpuinfo and make sure that laptop has the CPU you
think it has.  The reason I know which kernel version this problem appeared
in is because I spent an entire evening chasing this same "kernel bug"
a couple months ago.  Turned out the machine I could have _sworn_ was a
Celeron was a K6 :-)
