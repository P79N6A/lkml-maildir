All right, call me stupid, but twhere is the "duplication" in the code you 
removed?
I see the "security/capability.c" thing, yes, but I also look at
"security/dummy.c", and it appears that at least for that case nobody
would ever initialize the capabilities that we return to user space at
all.
So there's a bug somewhere there, and removing the duplication makes 
things worse (admittedly for a case which isn't enabled in the regular 
kernel, but still..)
So I'd ask you to have patience with me, and send a third patch that gets 
this thing right too..
