I use Reiserfs on everything now, including a 13 drive Fiber Channel 
SAN with 3 hosts and multiple levels of Software RAID between them.
It is as fast as ext2, and in some case much faster. (IE rm 10K+ files in ~2 
seconds) FYI I Bonnie 70MB/s on 6 7200rpm drives in RAID 0. (64k blocks)
Keeping up with the 'best' reiserfs patch set can be a little bit of a
chore. (However it looks like we're coming to the end of that with 2.4.10)
Never used ext3. From what I did read about it, it didn't excite me.
The others I've yet to see a mature enough version to actually use, and 
considering Reiserfs, don't see a reason to try them.
