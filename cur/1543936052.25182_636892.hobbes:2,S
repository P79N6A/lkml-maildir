This would create another large page size (and that would have my 
enthusiastic support). It would decrease listlock effect drastically for 
SLUB. Even the initial simplistic implementation of SLUB was superior on 
the database transaction tests (I think it was up ~1%) on IA64 from the 
get go. Likely due to the larger 16k page size there. The larger page size 
could also be used for the page cache (ducking and running.....)? A 64k 
page size that could be allocated without zone locks would be very good 
for SLUB.
However, isnt this is basically confessing that the page allocator is not 
efficient for 4k page allocations? I have seen some weaknesses there. The 
overhead in the allocation path in particular is bad and I was thinking 
about applying the same ideas used in SLUB also to the page allocator in 
order to bring the cycle count down from 500-1000 to 60 or so. Since both 
SLUB and SLOB use the page allocator for allocs >PAGE_SIZE this would not 
only benefit the general kernel but also the slab allocations.
