Hi,
after 6 months of careful integration and testing, I'm happy to announce
availability of Linux 2.4.35.
This one contains the same fixes as 2.4.34.6, plus a small set of add-ons,
among which some new PCI IDs, more usb-storage unusual devs, support for
high-speed USB HID, updated e1000 driver, a few watchdog updates, support
for systems with no keyboard controller (mainly blades), backport of the
skge and sky2 drivers from 2.6, support for the "notsc" boot option for
some broken dual-core x86_64 systems with no HPET, and a the latest fixes
from the LVM package.
Note that I'm very conscious that 2.4 has mostly left desktop PCs and
notebooks, but it's still commonly found on servers, route reflectors or
firewalls. For this reason, I'm open to merge the small updates required to
maintain such systems running (eg: PCI IDs and such), but I will generally
refuse all patches which add support for new desktop or notebook-specific
hardware, unless the people present very convincing arguments. Those people
generally would better upgrade their systems to 2.6.
The 2.4.34.X stable branch is now closed and a new 2.4.35.X branch will open
with the first next fixes. This model has proven very efficient to provide
riskless fixes, especially in a situation where several weeks may pass before
a patch gets tested on a production environment.
This version has been tested on x86 SMP, sparc64 SMP and alpha. Please report
any unexpected problem. As usual, all feedback is welcome.
  The patch and changelog will appear soon at the following locations:
