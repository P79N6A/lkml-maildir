Note that if you work from my git import, git has a nice tree bisection
option.
That tree may be very helpful if the regression is hidden in one of the
git trees imported into -mm, as it allows you to pinpoint the exact change
 -- as opposed to "it happened somewhere in git-large-foobar-update.patch".
