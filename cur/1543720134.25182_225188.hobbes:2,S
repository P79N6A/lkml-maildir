Chuckle :)
Personally I look at it the other way around -- why hasn't anybody on 
the OS side written up a proposal that satisfies 100% of the OS barrier 
needs?
We've got the device manufacturer contacts these days to get serious 
attention paid, IMO.  Just need the proposal now.
Just like Linux, ATA evolves in the direction that people speak up 
about...  I'll leave it to the audience to decide if Windows and data 
integrity go hand-in-hand <grin>
