Yes, except I was thinking for loglevel rather than size. Is a loglevel 
option - as in only save printk's above level X in dmesg - already 
available? I've seen other emails fly by on the printk system before so 
this could well already be available. I haven't checked but was assuming 
from the emails I'd seen so far that this didn't exist and was merely 
suggesting this thinking it'd be an easy addition to the dmesg store.
