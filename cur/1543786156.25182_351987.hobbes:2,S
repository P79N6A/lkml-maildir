Think about it some more.  You've added a new member to struct foo.
You want to fix up all the places which allocate struct foo to
initialise this new member.  Grepping for 'struct foo' returns 100
files.  Grepping for kmalloc in those 100 files returns 100 files.
Do you open all 100 in an editor and manually try and locate the five
kmalloc instances of this structure, and end up missing some.
Or do you do the sane thing and use kmalloc(sizeof(struct foo), ...)
and grep for "kmalloc[[:space:]]*(sizeof[[:space:]]*(struct foo)"
which returns only the five files and fix those up with knowledge
that you've found all the instances?

Such shuffling around should be done in easy to review stages so that
bugs can be found, and not a mega patch.  This inherently means that
for a structure name change, you don't end up with a new structure
named the same as an old structure.  And if you compile-test the
stages, you find out if you missed the problem.
That's the only real sane way of doing such changes to ensure
correctness.  Anything less and the patch should not be accepted.

Your solution is better if the only thing you're concerned about is
"are we allocating enough memory for this fixed size structure".
It completely breaks if you are also concerned about "are we doing
correct initialisation" or "are we allocating enough memory for this
variable sized structure" both of which are far more important
questions.
*especially* when you consider that kmalloc is redzoned and therefore
will catch the kinds of bugs you're suggesting.
