yes. by restoring a backup from tape. i tried cat /dev/zero > /dev/sdb1,
but that wasn't enough to trigger any corruption (i correctly wrote all
zeros). actually, now that i think about it, a good chunk of /dev/sdb2 was
cached when i read it back, so that wasn't a very good test. i definetly get
corruption under 2.4.5-ac4.
