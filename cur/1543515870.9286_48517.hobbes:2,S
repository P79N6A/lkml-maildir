I had to make a serial transceiver that would do 120 kBYTES per second.
I had to rip bytes into bits and also generate a clock. Two pins on
the 'printer' port is all you need. It isn't pretty, but it works.
Receive 'latched' the 'paper-out' bit on the printer-status interrupt.
(old printer-port, one-way). This worked. It was decided to do this
when it was discovered that the 8250 UART was clocked-internally on
the baud-rate so that RTS/DTR would never change fast enough.
Cheers,
