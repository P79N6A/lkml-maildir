I just installed the preemptive ( 
http://www.tech9.net/rml/linux/
 ----  preempt-kernel-rml-2.4.18-4 )  patch on my 2.4.18-xfs tree and when i run this kernel, every process ends with "exited with preempt_count 1" ( for example "rc.2[35] exited with preempt_count 1" )
The number varies from 1 to 41 so far.
Is this a known issue that there is a fix to, or is it just a misconfigured syslog?
Please CC the answer to me as i don't subscribe to the mailing list.
