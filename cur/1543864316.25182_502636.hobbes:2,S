If the whole idea is deployed on Linux, following core objects should be erased
1) anon_vma.
2) pgdata::active/inactive list and relatted methods -- mark_page_accessed etc.
3) PrivatePage::count and mapcount. If core need to share the page, add PG_kmap
   flag. In fact, page::lru_list can safetly be erased too.
4) All cases should be from up to down, especially simplifies debug.

Yes, it's my fault.

Um! Data cmpxchged should include access bit. And I have only x86 PC, memory <
1G. 3level pagetable code copied from Linux other functions.
