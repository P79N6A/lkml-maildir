There is talk of putting a subset of them back again, because a *lot* of
code does things like
((foo_t *)foo)++;
and the generalized lvalues extension makes that work as expected. Yes,
all such code is technically broken, but a large number of non-GCC
compilers also implement the extension enough for the construct above to
be valid.
Where it's really bad is in C++, where it can change the semantics of
some otherwise-valid code (due to the way it interacts with function
overloading). The whole generalized lvalues extension is definitely not
coming back, because fixing that C++ bug was a major reason why it was
removed in the first place.
