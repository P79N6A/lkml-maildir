The full dmesg with define DEBUG was included in the original message.  Unless 
something else was needed?

I was actually getting that on a stock FC6 kernel.  The dmesg output comes 
from a recompiled vanilla 2.6.19.x with the exact same configuration BUT the 
modified define's in hid-core.c and a local version appended to the .config 
file.  So this BUG does not only affect FC6 users but also the vanilla 
kernel.

Good thing, I've added myself to the CC list of both.
