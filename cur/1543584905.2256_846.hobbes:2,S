I haven't seen the beginning of the APIC/VIA/Tyan thread, but isn't there a
way to check if the APIC's OK, instead of resorting to workarounds like the
above?

That's a good point, actually. I can't recall a single BIOS or device BIOS
flasher that works under anything but DOS (or in some cases, Windows). Is
there any work being done on this for Linux?
