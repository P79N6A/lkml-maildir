John,
It's the driver.  We have been doing smartbits testing for more
than a year and found the same results as you appear to be getting.
The driver just dies and never recovers.  It attempts to do
interrupt mitigation(coalescing) but that appears to be useless.
The solution is to write a new driver which is what we have done
here...
Chip
