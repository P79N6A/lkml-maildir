It's racey.
	1) one process does read() on device, another does revoke()
followed by rmmod. Oops - nothing holds module in memory, the first
process is executing code from that module (->read(), that is) and
we unmap that code.
	2) every access to ->f_op suddenly becomes unsafe. Basically the
same scenario, but here we have the window between fetching ->f_op and
calling ->f_op->foo. You have no exclusion here, and even if you had, you
still got #1 to deal with.
IOW, it's broken by design - you can't just drop ->f_op and call it
quits. You certainly can't leave any process in the middle of code that
becomes unprotected. And it's not an SMP-only problem - since ->read() may
sleep you have #1 on UP too.
