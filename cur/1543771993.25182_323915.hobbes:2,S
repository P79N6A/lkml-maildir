Ok I can try using frame buffer, but I'm afraid to use such code for such
small graphic device. Maybe for the start I can forget use "mmap" and use only
"write" method ?
Do you know if I can find an example in kernel code for such implementation ?

does that mean once there is fbcon console driver set up on top of framebuffer
I can't use anymore /dev/fb for drawing graphics ?

yeah, but there's only one driver that uses text console implementation
and it can't be accessed for drawing graphics.
