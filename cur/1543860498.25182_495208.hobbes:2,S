the biggest user of clear_page and such is the pagefault code path in
practice.

yes I can believe that ....

.... however there is potentially a bigger thing possible.
These places that zero a whole full page may have just allocated it
(that's an assumption on my side), and if that's the case, maybe those
places instead should use the zeroing version of the allocator instead
(which internally uses clear_page() ).
So... yes I fully agree with you that it's worth looking at the
memset( , PAGE_SIZE) users. If they are page aligned, yes absolutely
make it a clear_page(), I think that's a very good idea. However also
please check if they've been very recently allocated in that code, and
if maybe the zeroing allocators are better suited there..
(or maybe there's even double zeroing going on.. that's be a nice gain)
