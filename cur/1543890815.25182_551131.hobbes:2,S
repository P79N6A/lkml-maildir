Actually now that I think about it, that wasn't correct.  The request 
CAN be completed before the data has hit the medium.  The barrier just 
constrains the ordering of the writes, but they can still sit in the 
disk write back cache for some time.

I think you misinterpret this, and it probably could be worded a bit 
better.  The barrier request is about constraining the order.  The 
forced flushing is one means to implement that constraint.  The other 
alternative mentioned there is to use ordered tags.  The key part there 
is "requests actually get written to non-volatile medium _in order_", 
not "before the request completes", which would be synchronous IO.
