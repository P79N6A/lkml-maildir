LDPC codes require to solve N order matrix over finite field - exactly
the reason I do not want to use Reed-Solomon codes even with optimized
non-Vandermonde matrix. I will investigate LDPC further though.
Turbo codes are like flow cipher compared to RS codes being block
ciphers. Transport media is reliable in data storages, otherwise they
would not even exist.
