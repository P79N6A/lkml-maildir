By the way, I am not in any shape, way or form making that assumption - 
although that's presumably how it would be *implemented* in an architecture 
with sane pointers like, to the best of my knowledge ALL gcc targets.
(foo *)bar++;
... should be implemented as ...
({
	foo *tmp1 = (foo *)bar;
	tmp2 = tmp1 + 1;
	bar = __typeof__(bar)tmp2;
	tmp1;
})
	-hpa
