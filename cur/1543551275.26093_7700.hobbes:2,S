I wonder if PAE somehow messes with the locking semantics
of the page table things, because the test on line 221 of
page_alloc.c depends on the fact that locking works.
[in fact, that test is there exactly to verify that nothing
went wrong with the locking and we're not re-using a page
that's already in use]
Could you send me the backtrace of one of the cases where
you hit the bug ?

OUCH ... this shouldn't happen and to be honest I don't
have an explanation for how this /could/ happen (or even
what it would have to do with the new VM)...
