Ok, it is possible the 0-page alloc failed because NOHIGHIO was
disabled, Linus's fix being less finegrined than mine could also lead
more easily to 0-page alloc failed.
However failing bounce-allocation is not important since we have the
reserved pool for those allocations. Not having to use the reserved
pool only allows an higher amount of I/O in parallel. This is why I said
we could have dropped the NOHIGHIO logic in first place if we wanted to
go the non finegrined way.
