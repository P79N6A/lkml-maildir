Fair enough. We have tried out the silly way of blktrace-ing, storing
data locally. So, it's probably not worthwhile discussing that.

I found some discussions on linux-btrace (Feburary 2006).
There is little information on how the alleged 2 percent impact has
been determined. Test cases seem to comprise formatting disks ...hmm.

Will try this next and post complaints, if any, along with numbers.
However, a fast network connection plus a second system for blktrace
data processing are serious requirements. Think of servers secured
by firewalls. Reading some counters in debugfs, sysfs or whatever
might be more appropriate for some one who has noticed an unexpected
I/O slowdown and needs directions for further investigation.
