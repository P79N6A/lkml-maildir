I found some of those in my log:
TCPv4 bad checksum from 206.132.163.167:0050 to 212.190.22.21:04dd,
len=436/456
TCPv4 bad checksum from 206.132.163.167:0050 to 212.190.22.21:04f1,
len=632/652
TCPv4 bad checksum from 206.132.163.167:0050 to 212.190.22.21:04f9,
len=893/913
TCPv4 bad checksum from 206.132.163.167:0050 to 212.190.22.21:04fd,
len=619/639
len is second field in len is always 20 bigger then the first.
When I checked the log, I see I got this for serveral times, with
different ip's, ussually the same ip a few time.
It started when I started using 2.3 (.20)
I'll try to setup tcpdump (never used it)
