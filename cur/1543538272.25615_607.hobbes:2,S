Having cool trap code is OK.  If you check the debugging extension flag
in the feature bits before attempting to access CR4, then it will never
trap and you'll know if the processor has a CR4 register or not, which
is what I thought you guys were trying to accomplish....
I'm sure Linus will do what's right in any case -- I tought the info
would be useful.  If you check the bit, then you will know for certain
the processor can support the opcodes.
