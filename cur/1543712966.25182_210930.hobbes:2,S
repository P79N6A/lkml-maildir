Vladislav Yasevich did some investigation into this issue and he came
out with the conclusion that this is due to a bug in the parser for
'make xconfig'(tkparse). 'make menuconfig' and 'make oldconfig' should work
fine.
The parser for 'make xconfig' (tkparse)  does not handle correctly
conditionals that redefine the same variable to be of two
different types.  This is particularly pronounce when one
is a dependancy variable and the other is not.  For each
[dep_]tristate definition, the parser generates lines in
the tk script that set the variable.  Whe TK interprets it,
the end result is that the variable is set incorrectly.  I was
able to modify the TK script by hand to fix this, but the
problem seems to realy be in the tkparse parser.
He came up with the following patch that works around this issue with
tkparse.  Could you please verify if this works for you?
