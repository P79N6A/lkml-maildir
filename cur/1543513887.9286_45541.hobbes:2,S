	Does anyone know how to restore a hard drive's partition table. I messed
	it up, trying to put FreeBSD on hda, with Linux already on hdb. When I
	run /sbin/lilo to install lilo on hda, I get the message.
	[root@speedy jkacur]# /sbin/lilo
	Added linux
	Added linuxmine *
	Device 0x0300: Invalid partition table, 1st entry
	  3D address:     0/0/0 (-1)
	  Linear address: 1/0/0 (0)
	[root@speedy jkacur]# 
	Anyone know what to do?

If I recall correctly, you can install FreeBSD both on the entire disk
or in a DOS-type partition. It uses a different type of partition table itself.
LILO expects a DOS-type partition table, so if you want to use LILO on hda
and also have FreeBSD on hda, it is easiest to have FreeBSD inside a partition,
and not on the whole disk.
