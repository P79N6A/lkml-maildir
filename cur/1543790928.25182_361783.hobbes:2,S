The biggest part is the PCM middle layer.  It's bold.
It's one of my TODO list to diet this one, especially for small
systems.
The amount of ac97 codec support code may be easily reduced, too, by 
selecting codec chips to support.  It's not a generic solution for
distributions but good for private built kernels.
