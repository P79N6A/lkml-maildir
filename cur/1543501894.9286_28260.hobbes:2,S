Unfortunately, not only to ext2fs.

No. There is KGIcon, but it is different.

Cool.

Do you mean 2.2 or 2.3? :-)
Some kernel versions are broken because of one new feature!
The kernel must not depend of cache.

??? :-)

Agree, but the main problem is not features - TIME !
Here for example a triller about 'FS forks' (or another cool) feature:
1. Months (years?) of discussion (now) about is it relly neded.
     This time is lost for projects using ugly replacements for the
'forks'.
2. Implementation (I mean it as necessary because *people* want it).
     2.5.14 'forks' patch (10 kb)
     2.5.15 - 2.5.35 kernels are broken because of amount of unneeded
dependencies.
     ext3fs bugs - till 2.6.8 kernel.
     months are lost !
3. Testing (Mindcraft-2001)
     2.7.3 'forks' patch (1 kb)
     2.7.4 - 2.7.11 kernels are broken...
Although the above is a science fiction, it based on reality :-(.
Another large problem is _distribution_.
Neither home nor corporate users like to recompile the kernel.
Therefore commercial driver developers will follow NT too.
It is much more than just some features.
               Best regards
                         Alexander.
