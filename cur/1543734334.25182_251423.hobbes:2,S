yeah. Does the attached patch fix it?

might make sense - needs benchmarking. In particular the performance of
kill(pid, 0) [PID lookup] should be benchmarked on the cycle level, and
the combined performance of pthread_create()+pthread_exit().

indeed.
i'm wondering, dont we have a similar problem with PROC_TID_FD_DIR
already? Running some simple code that opens 1 million files gives:
 [root@saturn root]# ulimit -n 1000000
 [root@saturn root]# ./open-fds 1000000
 999997 fds opened
 [root@saturn root]# cd /proc/2333/fd/
 [root@saturn fd]# ls -li | grep 153028253

plenty of overlap in the #ino space.
