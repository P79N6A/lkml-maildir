Ok, I've compiled and installed 2.6.0-test11 in UP mode and it boots
up and runs just fine on my box.  Here's the /proc/interrupts:

I suspect it's an APIC issue, I seem to recall having to do something
about this before.  Any way, I'm re-compiling UP, but with the APIC
enabled, but not the IO-APIC stuff.  We'll see how that goes.
Hopefully more tonight, but maybe not.
