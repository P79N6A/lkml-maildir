Guess again. You are expanding the stack because you have no room left on it.
You take a fault. You want to report a SIGSEGV. Now where are you
going to put the stack frame ?
SIGSEGV in combination with a preallocated alternate stack maybe, but then you
still need to recover. C++ you can maybe do it with exception handling but
C doesnt really have the structure and longjmp just doesnt cut it.
