I see the struct acctcsa has a ac_prid.. Are you planning on adding 
project level accounting to linux, or is this just leftovers from
IRIX? 
I'm not familiar with CSA, but have some experience with using the 
IRIX system audit trail for accounting (satd). satd isn't handling the
accounting very well when we get hard hangs or power outages, and no 
end-of-job record is written. Then we have no account for the cpu-usage 
of the non-finished jobs at the time.
Does CSA handle this better, or is it still depending on jobs being 
finished before writing any accounting records? (a way telling it to
log periodic intermidiate accounting records would be nice)
