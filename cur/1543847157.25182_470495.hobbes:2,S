The unmodified tulip driver checks both MWI and cacheline-size because 
one of the clones (PNIC or PNIC2) will let you set the MWI bit, but 
hardwires cacheline size to zero.
If the arches do not behave consistently, we need to keep the check in 
the tulip driver, to avoid incorrectly programming the csr0 MWI bit.
