Hi Riley,
I think we should think about the subsystems which are required
for writing the oops:
currently the following subsystems are required:
(I'm not sure that the list is complete or accurate)
1) syslogd (user mode program, i.e we need the
	scheduler)
2) the filesystem
3) the buffer cache
4) the device driver
5) the interrupt handler
6) bottom-half handling
OR, if you have a nasty bug,
then you can use the serial console, and you
only need a small device driver for the oops report.
(But you need a second computer).
> 1. Write the oops to a dedicated oops partition.
I have a better idea: copy the code from the 
swap file implementation:
at system startup, a special file is choosen
( cat "/root/report" > /proc/oopsfile somewhere
in rc.sysinit), we set the file size to 64 kB, zero
any previous contents, read the disk location with bmap().
If we have an oops, then we can bypass the filesystem
for the report.
During the next startup, rc.sysinit can check that
the file is empty.
This system has all advantages of a dedicated oops partition,
but does not require disk layout changes.
This has the advantage that this would be portable.
> 2. use the swap partition.
we must disable swapping before we can write to a swap partition.
I think a special file is easier.

It's not very portable, but this can catch oops report
during the kernel startup, i.e. before 'init' is started.
------------
1) I don't know enough about the typical side effects
of an oops, so I don't know how many oops reports
which are currently lost could be stored if we
use a special file. I won't try to write a patch.
2) I currently think about writing an oops report to the
parallel port: 
- you can write to the parallel port without interupts, without
bottom-half handlers (at least on the Intel platform)
- we can even try to implement a complete console on the parallel
port. Obviously, output only ;=).
- I think that many linux users have a printer,
but few users have a second computer for the console log.
We don't need fancy graphics, so the printer driver should be very
simple.
