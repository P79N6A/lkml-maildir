Hi,
   Kernel: Standard 2.4.28
   Hardware: IBM xSeries 305 with ServerWorks CSB5 IDE controller and a 
pair of IC35L090AVV207-0 drives; one per channel.  IDE CD-ROM as slave
on first channel, no slave on the second.
   Symptom: dma_timer_expiry occasionally (~ once/week)
-----------------------------------------
hdc: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x20
hdc: timeout waiting for DMA
hdc: timeout waiting for DMA
hdc: (__ide_dma_test_irq) called while not waiting
hdc: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hdc: drive not ready for command
ide1: reset: success
----------------------------------------
it then seems to recover - (this is better than the 2.4.21
we had on there previously which died after that).
Any ideas? Dying disk?
Dave
