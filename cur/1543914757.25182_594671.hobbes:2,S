My recollection is that we shifted from "Enable the apic even if the 
BIOS disabled it" to "Only use the apic if the BIOS didn't disable it" 
around that time, which meant that distributions could actually turn on 
apic-on-up support without breaking everything. That might correspond to 
what you're seeing.
