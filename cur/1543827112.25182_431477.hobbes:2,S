That was my question to you from the beginning: do you propose a common
interface based on taskstats or genetlink?
If CSA defines its own taskstats genetlink attirbute, does it listen to
the same socket as delayacct? If yes, then the socket will be jammed with
duplicate information before long.
Is it an option to make per-tgid data a unicast? Ie, your daemon
periodically
polling the per-tgid stats?
