... and now he corrects himself. I just tried applying Ross Dickson's 
patches for APIC quirks on nForce2 chipsets:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/12/21/7
and that seems to have taken care of my problem completely. I have not 
tested for very long, but I got through the bonnie++ test suite; never even 
came close before.
So the Promise controller and driver appear to be innocent of my woes, and I 
do not know any reason to think that your kernel will hang because of them.
Sorry 'bout that. (And thanks Ross!)
