Hi Andrew,

I tried putting a memory pressure on the machine, then unused pages on 
the page LRU could be reclaimed.  In short, as you said, they were
not really leaked at all!
But I also saw the situation that memory and swap were exhausted when
I laid heavy load on ext3 for 20 consecutive days.  It seemed that the
pages couldn't be reclaimed then.
So I'll try to reproduce and let you know if something happens.
Best regards,  Akira Fujita
