Hmmm... Flawless :)
Then I must have found an undocumented feature!  I've applied this set
of patches to a 2.6.11 kernel (with few problems) and ran into a bunch
of "scheduling while atomic" errors when hotplugging a drive, culprit
being probably scsi_sysfs.c where scsi_remove_device locks a mutex, or
perhaps when it then calls class_device_unregister, which does a
'down_write'.
Perhaps we need some sort of workqueue for hotplug requests to get
them out of the atomic interrupt handler context where they originate?
