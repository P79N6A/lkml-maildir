I'm not sure mergedfb is really "the way" to go long term.  It has
certain limitations (drawing engine limits, scrolling viewport when
using dissimilar modes on each head, etc.).  We might be better off
sharing access to the 3d engine like we do for 2D with "regular"
multihead.  xinerama could then be handled by indirect rendering mixed
with DMX and GLproxy.  some sort of fast path could be designed for
dualhead cards if a 3D window strattled both heads.  Just a thought.
