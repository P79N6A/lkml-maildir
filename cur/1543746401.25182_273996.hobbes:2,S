With two 2.6.9 boxes (really, 2.6.9-mm1 and 2.6.9-bproc), I get this:
nada:~> iperf -s
------------------------------------------------------------
Server listening on TCP port 5001
TCP window size: 85.3 KByte (default)
------------------------------------------------------------
[  4] local 155.210.155.215 port 5001 connected with 155.210.155.212 port 41695

annwn:/proc/sys/net> iperf -c nada
------------------------------------------------------------
Client connecting to nada, TCP port 5001
TCP window size: 16.0 KByte (default)
------------------------------------------------------------
[  3] local 155.210.155.212 port 41695 connected with 155.210.155.215 port 5001

So 94 Mbits/sec, through 100Mb ether. So parhaps the netsork layer
is not the culprit, just the driver.
BTW:
I'm getting an oops with 2.6.9 that ends on a call to skb_clone,
using e1000. Is this what you refer to ?
If the answer is yes, do you have any pointer to a patch to fix just
this ? I would prefer an individual patch instead of full -bk, because
I use 2.6.9+bproc, and probably bproc wont patch against -bk.
TIA.
