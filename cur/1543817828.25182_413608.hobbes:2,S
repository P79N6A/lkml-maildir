Thx for sharing it. Unfortunately it doesn't help me. (I am not using suspend 
or anything on that machine as it is supposed to be running 24/7.) After 
pulling out the LAN cable and putting it back in. network is dead. The driver 
(even unpatched) sees the cable is back in, but obviously wrongly 
reinitializes(?) the nic: Ie, kernel says after pluggin cable back in:
uli526x: eth0 NIC Link is Up 100 Mbps Full duplex
but network is dead.
I have to do:
ifconfig eth0 down
modprobe -r uli526x
modprobe uli526x
ifconfig eth0 up
dhclient
And then it works again.
