Putc isn't the problem - that caches up full blocks of data before giving
them to the kernel.
The problem would be something like syslog, which you really might like to
search/index frequently (real time analysis).
No log would be able to handle all cases, and you will have to figure out
what to do for the exceptions, and recovery procedures when that fails.
