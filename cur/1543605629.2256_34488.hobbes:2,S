Interesting you should mention this analogy. Incidently, I would've
preferred that my car give me a detail analysis of what's wrong. In fact, it
would've been such a cool feature that it would be reason enough to sell my
car and by that one (I could save myself years of arguing with incompetent
mechanics).
I suspect most people on this list feel the same as me and also feel that
kernel debugging messages is not only a feature, but essential!
See the difference between the O/S in question and the one you might be
confusing it with is that this O/S was (and still is) written and being
maintained by technical people. These kind of people like to know what's
going on. It also happens that the primary audience for these people's work
is themselves (us) and NOT novices - that my friend, is a bonus, not the
sole aim of the exercise.
