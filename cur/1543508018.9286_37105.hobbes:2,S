Ok I see it in 2.3.16 as well, net/econet/econet.c gets compiled
every time.
It's because the filename matches net/%/%.c and that winds up depending
on 'dummy'.  In other words, Rules.make is reserving certain names and
patterns and net/econet/econet.c happens to step on one.
Extra compilation doesn't bug me; *missing* compilation bugs me; so I
am going to leave it here.
You can do this to get a trace log:
    (make -d vmlinux subdirs=NET 2>&1) | less
