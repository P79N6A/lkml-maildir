The /usr/include/net directory is not shared between kernel and libc on modern 
systems.  
It would be possible to split those definitions out into a new 
<linux/something> header from where both linux/socket.h and bits/socket.h 
could use them, but that would introduce extra versioning interdependencies 
between kernel and libc, and to be honest it doesn't hurt all that much to 
maintain two copies.
