I even had two of them :)  But I couldn't find nice docs easily, 
so I didn't bother.  I've now passed the machines on to a nutty
NC guy (peter jones), maybe he'll have more luck.
The nicest way to do this port would be to get the motorotola
vme reference boards, I hear mot.de still has them in stock.
Don't forget a very large barf-bag to deal with the 88k iteslf,
and a time machine to find anyone else on the planet who knows
anything about them.
