Subject: Memory leak in 2.6.11.10/2.6.12-rc4?

I am using 2.6.11.10 (and have also tried the same with 2.6.12-rc4). I 
have a Dell Poweredge 850, with 2 GB RAM. I am trying a simple test like:
#!/bin/sh
cd /var/tmp
while true;
do
    find /usr -name "*" | xargs strings > /var/tmp/spin.txt
done
And after sometime (less than 20 mins)I do see that the free command returns:
#free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:       2075060    1872904     202156          0      27696     453404
-/+ buffers/cache:    1391804     683256
Swap:      2097136          0    2097136
#
And after 15 mins:
#free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:       2075060    2002064      72996          0      11840     393372

Swap:      2097136          0    2097136
#
(The only patch applied to the kernel is aacraid 2391).
After having stopped the program the free returns this:
# free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:       2075060    1951632     123428          0      15988     330064
-/+ buffers/cache:    1605580     469480
Swap:      2097136          0    2097136
Can someone please help me on this?
Thanks in advance,
Ashish
