On MMU-mode, /dev/zero's-->mmap gives zerod memory.
On NO-MMU-mode, we have to do memset(,,,) to give zerod memory. So the
different malloc size has the different time cost.
So Bryan's test case shows the terrible performance result.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Summary is, when I run the app "time test",
on x86:
real    0m0.066s
user    0m0.008s
sys     0m0.058s
on Blackfin:
real    3m 37.69s
user    0m 0.04s
sys     3m 37.58s
---------------------------------------------------------------
So now the question is,
Keep the same behave as MMU but with bad performance, or keep the same
performance as MMU but without the same behave, Which one is more
important?
