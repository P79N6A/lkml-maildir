agree with the first part (PAGE_SIZE allocation) but not necessarily agree
with making it a linked list at all times because that means performance
overhead in cases where it needn't be.
Speaking of which, does someone have a nice multi-threaded multi-process
poll() sample program that lets one stress-test/benchmark this area?
Otherwise I will knock something up myself but perhaps it already exists?
