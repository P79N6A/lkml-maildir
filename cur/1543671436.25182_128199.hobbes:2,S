Alan -- could you please explain what you see as the real
differences between reverse engineering for "compatibility"
and for "cloning"?
It isn't obvious to me that there is a line-in-the-sand.
For example, a Word document extractor like "wv" is not
nearly as useful without an attached word processor (be it
or not that your intention is to save in that format).

Is that really true?  It may make sense for a lot of
consumer applications, but does it really apply to source
control?
Isn't it the case that sometimes features are more compelling
than compatibility?
