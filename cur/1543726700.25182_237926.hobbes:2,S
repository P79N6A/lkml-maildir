Well you could have just tried it, all you needed to do was paste the code
for find_first_bit into a file and make a simple test case. Then plugging
in a value of 0x0 for the map. so in pseudocode for NR_CPUS = 3;
first_cpu(0) = next_cpu(0) = 32.

Yes i did specify that in the original email.

The find_next_bit code, the additional find_first_bit on the failure to
find a bit exit path and i'm referring to this bug, the one i'm reporting
now.

I was short on time to do a complete audit, the change to cpumask.h is a
necessity anyway.
