heh.  Yes, I tried that too a year or so ago.  Basically just
add
	if (!(eflags & 0x0200))
		whine();
to spin_lock_irq().  There was a *lot* of whining.

mm?  Those are legal (albeit unpleasant) inside local_irq_save(),
but illegal inside global_cli() in 2.5.  Aren't they?  If not,
then release_kernel_lock() needs talking to.
