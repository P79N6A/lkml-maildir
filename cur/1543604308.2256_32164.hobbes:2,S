Any idea why DMA is sometimes on and sometimes not for a few cdrom
drives I have hooked up to my promise controller?
Whether it is on or off, whenever I copy a CD from a (dma) cdrom whether
it dma is on or off it slows my system down big time.  Move the cursor
around in X, and it lags, watch X-Chat, the characters you type in
slowly appear 3-5 seconds after.
Hook the same drives up to the motherboard ide interfaces and there is
no lag at all.
This has always been the case with my cdroms.
When I had my HD on the Promise, it did DMA etc just fine.
Is there a problem with the driver if a HD is not on there it doesn't do
DMA correctly or something?
