Yes, it changes the semantics. Suddenly you can "cd linux-2.6.17.tar.bz2". 
But what will stat() return? S_IFDIR? S_IFREG? S_IFANY? A .tar parser in 
kernelspace is almost never the right thing. And then a cpio parser, 
because that's what initramfs'es are made of. Not to forget .zip, because 
that's omnipresent. Oh of course we'd also need bzip2 and gzip decoder. 
BASE64 and UU anyone?

I wish you a lot of fun with users in LDAP or other exotic storage methods.
By making Everything possible through echo, you are violating the unix 
philosophy that one tool should do one thing (though echo does just that). 
And in this case, echo would be chown, chmod, tar, bzip2 all at once. This 
sounds familiar, I think I have seen this with explorer.exe (and its 
uncountable DLLs), which lets you change everything within the same 
window.
What I think is promising are the compression/encryption plugins. ext2 
and 3 had an attribute (`lsattr`) for compression but it does not seem like 
ever implemented.
