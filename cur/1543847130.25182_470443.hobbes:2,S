Yep, that was part of the design.  When I approached Peter Anvin and
the other kernel.org maintainers during OLS about hosting the -rt wiki
on kernel.org infrastructure, what we explicitly talked about was
making it easy to set up other wiki's for multiple kernel projects,
just like kernel.org hosts multiple mailing lists beyond just the
LKML.
If we get too many wiki's, or the wiki's get too much traffic, we may
need to hit up some corporate sponsors to update the hardware which is
driving the *.wiki.kernel.org domain, but I suspect that won't be
terribly difficult.  Both the real-time wiki and the embedded wiki
would benefit and are of interest to a large number of companies, and
I'm sure we wouldn't have too much difficulty hitting them up for
money for hardware upgrades.  :-)

I'd suggest sending mail to webmaster@kernel.org.
