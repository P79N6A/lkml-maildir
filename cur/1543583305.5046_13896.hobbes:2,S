There are a few cases in the pc keyboard controller not currently honouring
the delay protocol requirements (the keyboard controller was ancient when
the original PC came out) and some chipsets use keyboard controllers or
integrated keyboard support that still requires the delays. From checking
the ps2 mouse open code Im sure there are several others uncaught.
A second possibility is its USB stuff confusing things, build without USB or
with USB modular - I suspect the former
