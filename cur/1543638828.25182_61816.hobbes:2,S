	Hi,
	Sorry to disturb, but it seems that kernel.org didn't pick up
2.4.20-pre1 (or I'm looking at the wrong places).
	I'm asking because I've just finished testing my IrDA update
for 2.4.20, and you've just included some useless IrDA change that
probably render my patch worthless. So, I need to check and see how
much more work I need to do (or if I should just give up).
	Regards,
	Jean
