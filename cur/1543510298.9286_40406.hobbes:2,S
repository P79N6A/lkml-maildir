Yep -- Hard-coding a value suitable for a large config is just as
bad (maybe worse) for a small box than the reverse, hard-coding a
value suitable for a small config if for a large config. (uh, did
that come out right?)
Sounds like you found a new configurable(s)... auto-config would be
good, if you can come up with a good heuristic, but manual config
should be possible in any case.

The nice thing about making such things configurable, is that you
can also make it smaller than it is now on a tiny config, like a 4MB
palmtop.
