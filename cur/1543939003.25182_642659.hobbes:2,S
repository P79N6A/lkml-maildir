Are you saying that TDM is sharing same pins with the other QE device,
and we can choose to use/not use some device depending on which driver
is loaded? I think this particular board and patch isn't that case.
Even if someday there will be the case when drivers are mutually
exclusive, i.e. presence of some driver should trigger pins
reconfiguration, then anyway this should be handled differently.
That is, we should not _register_ two mutually exclusive devices
in the first place, so drivers will not probe them. That's board
setup code authority, and pins configuration still should happen
there.
[ Irrelevant to UCCs and this particular case: lately I've
  encountered one interesting case of Par IO usage. FHCI USB needs
  switching between pin's dedicated functions and GPIO functions.
  So, firstly it is using pins as dedicated, and later (at the bus
  reset) driver turns them to act as GPIOs. This is still handled
  without pio-map though, via gpios = <> property for that driver. ]

In that particular case UCC configuration is static, for every UCC.
So, we can set up all pins in the firmware/board file.
Please correct me if I'm wrong.
