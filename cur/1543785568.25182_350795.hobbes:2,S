The main difference will be that the options without "auto" flag
or where the script said "n" will be skipped.
It will reduce quite considerably the number of questions.
The algorithm is quite simple:
If (no "auto" field) ---> go for the default
If ("auto" field) --->
	script gives n  --->  go for "n"
	script gives y  --->  ask for [y/n]
	script gives y/m -->  ask for [y/m/n]
That's all folks...
