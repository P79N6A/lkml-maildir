OK, how do you suggest to track bugs in a way that doesn't suck?
Bug reports to linux-kernel have the big problem that they are lost if 
no developer immediately picks them up.

What I do know is that the majority of them has never been proper 
debugged by a kernel developer knowing the subsystem in question.

I tracked 2.6.21-rc regressions, and I do not scale for higher numbers 
of bugs. When I had to track 36 known regressions it was a real 
nightmare.
Bugzilla tracks regressions and scales for higher numbers of bugs.
Let me ask you two questions:
- Do you think regression tracking makes any sense at all?
- If yes, which scalable way of regression tracking would in your
  opinion not suck?
