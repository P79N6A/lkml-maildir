Oh yeah... but getting rid of the mapping so userspace gets a segfault
might be a good idea too.  However, leaving the old PCI mapping there
seems rather risky to me: I think it's entirely possible that accesses
to that area after the device is gone could trigger machine checks or
worse.
So what's the right way for a driver to get rid of a remap_pfn_range()
mapping into userspace?
