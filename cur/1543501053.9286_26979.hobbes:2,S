Dax,
I also just spoke to the Court and they indicated they have a copy of the
document, and that anyone from the public can come in and get a copy of it.
Novell attempted to place the document under seal, but the court rejected
the request.  It's a pubic document.  I am going to be down at the
courthouse anyway later today.  I will pick up a "public" copy and fax it to
you.  What's your fax number?
Jeff
