ok, ok, there is a bug. but the mask is still not needed. the
real bug is that pkt is of type char instead of unsigned char.
so a simple cast would be enough:
	 +       *x = (unsigned char) pkt[1] | ((pkt[2] & 0x0F) << 8);
but i changed the whole thing to unsigned char all over the place.
it's better anyway.
