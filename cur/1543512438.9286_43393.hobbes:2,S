Task switch overhead is accounted for by goodness(), no? If not, then
it should be.

If by RT tasks you mean SCHED_RR then we do exactly the right thing
for them. For SCHED_FIFO see below.

Oops. I assumed the new one is added at the end of the runqueue (as
the man page says). In reality it's added at the beginning, see
wake_up_process() and setscheduler(). This (the current behaviour) is
wrong, according to "man sched_setscheduler". I don't have a copy of
the relevant POSIX standard so I can't check there. That's easily
fixable, I'll post an updated patch.

True. I can argue that my special case triggers less often that the
old special case but I won't. I guess I can also bundle my new check
with the move_rr_last like you do in your patch.
What I meant by "special case for prev" is this logic: "If the
previous process is still runnable then make it the default, only then
start going through the runqueue." I don't like that for two reasons:
1. I think it's unnecessary policy - prev is still in the runqueue and
goodness() should be the only criterion for selection. 2. It gets in
my way.
<ASIDE> 
Here is what I want to do: I'm writing a "fair" scheduler (see
http://www.cs.umass.edu/~lass/software/qlinux/
). I will have several
separate runqueues. In schedule() I first select a runqueue and then
choose a process from that runqueue. In this scheme it makes no sense
to make prev the default process to run, since it might belong to the
wrong runqueue. If the standard scheduler didn't do that, then the
modifications I need to in schedule() are a lot nicer and localized.

I see.

See above about SCHED_FIFO/SCHED_RR processes going to the beginning
of the runqueue rather than the end when woken up.
