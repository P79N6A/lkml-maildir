Chicken and egg, really.  There's no support for streams currently, so
nothing uses them.  (I don't think KDE currently supports what I
described; it was just an example.)  Since nothing is using it, there's
no big push to develop it.
Once it's in place, I would expect people to start to explore and exploit
the possibilities, like having one executable "file" that has different
streams for different chips/platforms, and the loader chooses which one
it uses, or an executable with localization streams for different
languages, or both.
Move from there to "standard streams" like a stream that lists the
home page for the file, be it a program or a copy of the latest
hot-summer-movie-trailer, that any (supporting) browser can find and
jump to.
Applications can use it to store extra data of their own.  Apache might
write hit statistics to a stream on the file, so when you move the file
from server A to server B, you keep the statistics automatically.  If
it's further in a standard format you could move the file from IIS to
Apache and still keep the statistics.

IIRC, it depends on the versions/service pack level, but it does work
on some Windows-to-Windows systems.  W2k->W2k I'm pretty sure works,
but I haven't tested it myself.  The rest of the time it quietly
strips off the streams.

Again, IIRC, the streams are stripped off when you copy from NTFS to FAT.
I do most of my work in BSD and/or Linux environments.  It's been
a while since I worked much with WinXX.  When I interviewed
for my current job they mentioned my past NT experience and I told them
I'd rather gnaw my own hands off than develop under NT again.
