Are you able to leverage the new EA interface?  (Which I still don't like
because of the namespace syntax embedded in the attribute names, btw,
please don't misinterpret silence as happiness.)

It would be nice if some other filesystems could share that mechanism, do
you think it's feasible?  If not, what's the stumbling block?  I haven't
looked at this for some time and there's was some furious work going on
exactly there just before 2.5.  It seems we've at least progressed a
little from the viewpoint that nobody would want that.

Andrew Morton is working on generic delayed allocation at the vfs level I
believe, why not bang heads with him and see if it can be made to work with
VFS?

It would be nice to have unsucky file events.  But there's been roughly zero
discussion of dmapi on lkml as far as I can see.

True enough.
