Some questions:
1. Do you have a book on basic C programming?
2. Can you go and read it?
3. Can you read the kernel source before making changes to assess
   their impact properly?
4. Can you test your patches before mailing them onto l-k?
If the answer to 1 and 2 is yes, do so - you might learn something.  Then
come back to l-k with a better, less brain-dead patch.
