That would be a dubious circumvention. Remember that the GPLv3 is still a
draft - the wording can (and should probably) be improved to make it clear
that the system as a whole must behave identically if a modified version
of the GPL'ed software is used.

It's a good place to start putting pressure on the OEM's. If they can
choose between heavy DRM'ed and closed hardware, and pay millions in
license fees, or get the software they need for free in return for
dropping the restrictions, some are bound to choose the free route. This
is where the fight begins.
