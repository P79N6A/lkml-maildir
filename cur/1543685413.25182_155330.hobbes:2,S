As far as I am aware none of the microcode updates even apply
to 933Mhz era PIII, just the ones the BIOS ships with by default
nowdays. Also the kind of stuff the errata fix are obscure 
ultra-weird corner cases people just don't hit.
Thus I'd be very suprised if loading the microcode any earlier
was neccessary - certainly nobody else has reported needing to.

The kernel can't load the microcode until it has booted, it can
load it very early after that from initrd.
