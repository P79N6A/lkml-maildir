Heh :)
OK I agree on all these points. And yeah it has worked quite well...
But by real -rc, I mean 2.6.9 is a week after 2.6.9-rcx minus the
extraversion string; nothing more.
The main point (for me, at least) is that if -rc1 comes out, and I'm
still working on some bug or having something else tested then I can
hurry up and/or send you and Linus a polite email saying don't release
yet.
Would probably be a help for people running automated testing and
regression tests, etc. And just generally increase the userbase a
little bit.
Catching the odd paper bag bug would be a fringe benefit.
