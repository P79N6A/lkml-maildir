 I thought that I saved it, but I didn't. This came up a while ago
(I think under a subject of "definition of realtime") and a useful
distinction was made.
 Soft real-time: If the deadline is missed, the value of the system
   begins to decrease at some rate.

                                     deadline
  "Firm" real-time: If the deadline is missed, the value of the process
    immediately becomes some finite value <= 0.

                                     deadline
  Hard real-time: If the deadline is missed, the systems' value becomes
    negative infinity. In other words, the deadline *cannot* be missed.

 Example of soft real-time: streaming data to a CD-R buffer. It's not
    ideal if the streaming interrupts, but not immediately catastrophic.
    Eventually you're going to have a coaster if you don't catch up.
 Example of "firm" real-time: Winprinters. The CPU more-or-less controls
    the print head directly. If you can't get the data to the print
    head fast enough, you might as well start over. You waste a sheet of
    paper and some quantity of ink.
 Example of hard real-time: Industrial robot safety system. If that
    fails, you could kill someone.
 Normal Linux is probably adequate for most soft real-time applications,
and probably a lot of firm real-time applications, and perhaps there's
room for some improvement here. I think I agree with Linus that if you
really have a hard real-time constraint, you're better off using a more
specialized system.
 I'd say high-quality audio and video falls somewhere between soft and
firm, depending on application. Sometimes an occasional glitch in the
stream is acceptable, sometimes it isn't. However, I can't think of too
many cases where an audio skip would lead directly to someone's death.
