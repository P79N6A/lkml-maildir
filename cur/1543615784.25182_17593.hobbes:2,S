Ah! You're using LVM! There are known bugs in LVM which cause memory
corruptions. I told Heinz about this on 16-DEC, but it appears the CVS
tree hasn't been updated yet. So grab the latest CVS tree (which fixes
some bugs) and then apply the appended patch (which fixes more
bugs). You definately need both. The patch should be applied in the
drivers/md directory.
I'm afraid that you will need to manually apply this patch, because
the LVM CVS tree has a pile of #ifdef CONFIG_DEVFS_FS's in it, whereas
the LVM code in the kernel tree (which is what I generated the patch
against) has these #ifdef's stripped.
I've offered to Marcelo to take the current LVM CVS, apply my fixes
and send him a patch. That would avoid this problem coming up again
(and again). I haven't had a response yet. Perhaps he's still
recovering from his holiday. I hope so, because that probably means he
enjoyed himself :-)
Marcelo: will you accept such a patch?
