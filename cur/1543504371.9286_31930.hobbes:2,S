Hello,
as mentioned earlier in this list I have a problem mounting nfs-v3 from
a Soalris-Box. As I have no Linux-Box which supports nfs-v3 (especially
mount v3) I can only tell about the Solaris-Box:
When I da an nfs-Mount e.g:
mount -o nfsvers=3,mountvers=3,tcp godzilla:/local /mnt
I get a mount error. If I snoop the packets I see the following:
MOUNT3 R Mount OK FH=0085 Auth=unix
.
.
.
NFS C GETATTR2 FH=FED4			<-- Wrong FH!!!
NFS R GETATTR2 Stale NFS file handle
Shouldn't this be GETATTR3 then? Even the FH is wrong.
If I do such a mount from another Solaris-Box I get:
MOUNT3 R Mount OK FH=00A5 Auth=unix
.
.
.
NFS C GETATTR3 FH=00A5                 <-- Same FH as in MOUNT!!
NFS R GETATTR3 OK
Hope this helps to trace the problem. By the way I'm using kernel
2.2.10-ac12
Bye
Martin
