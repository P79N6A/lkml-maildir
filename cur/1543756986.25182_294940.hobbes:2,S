I wasn't very active on the list back then, but post something like this
again and I'll second it publicly. You may have already done so, but I
might have missed it. I'll cc the LKML to make this public anyway.

I don't know the architecture of the tool, but I've worked on some
pretty big projects, that could disable most of the tool with just a
simple config option. Heck, the Linux kernel does this.  But if the
design of the tool is such that you can't disable features without
destroying others (like removing IE from Windows),  then I guess this is
not an option. 
I guess you are dealing with three groups of people.
1) The ones paying you. The companies that spend money to get things
done.  -- Needs full version of BK.
2) The Open Source developers, Linus and others that like BK and will
work with it with whatever license you give it. -- Needs strong version
of BK. Probably no more than 100 users (or less).
3) The Open Source users, tweakers, hackers that are not the core
developers. -- Needs only to checkout the kernel. Probably over 1000
users.  I fall in this category.
This is why we have asked about three versions. Obviously, Linus and
friends are the most important part for the Linux community, so even if
it hurts 2000 other people that only want to download the lastest
snapshots from BK, it really doesn't matter.  Let us complain, but
unless Linus decides to go elsewhere, we are stuck.  So don't do the
crippled version if it hurts Linus.
