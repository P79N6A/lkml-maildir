The PER_CPU_SHARED_ALIGNED is corresponding to
.data.per_cpu.shared_aligned section which has all shared and aligned
percpu data.
In future, another section .data.per_cpu.shared and its macro
DEFINE_PER_CPU_SHARED might be added for shared but not aligned.
BTW, DEFINE_PER_CPU_SHARED_ALIGNED is already getting shorter than
pervious version.
Thanks.
