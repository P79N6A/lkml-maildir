Fetch 
ftp://ftp.ocs.com.au/pub/ksymoops/ksymoops-0.7b.tar.gz
 and
install it.  Then run your log through ksymoops, using your current
System.map and mail the result to l-k.
ksymoops-07.a added support for "spinlock stuck" messages.  The only
different between 0.7a and 0.7b is a 1 character typo in the Makefile
(plus a version number change).
