Might I suggest that if you like the "we know best just trust us" 
approach, there is another OS to use. Making information available to 
good applications will improve system performance, or at least allow 
better limitation of requests for resources, and bad applications will 
be bad regardless of what you hide. You don't hide the CPU hardware any 
more than the memory size.
