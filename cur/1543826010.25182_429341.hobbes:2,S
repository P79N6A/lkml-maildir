but 0 is pretty much the worst choice for something that needs to be 
reliable - it's the most common type of machine word in existence, 
amongst all the 18446744073709551616 possibilities. And we need not care 
about userspace's prior choices, this code and data is totally under the 
kernel's control.

i'm not only talking about RSP/ESP corruption, but about stack 
corruption. I.e. some area of the stack is corrupted. With the scanning 
method we at least get some other entries out - while with the unwind 
method we only say 'sorry'.
anyway, i think that handling a bad initial RIP/EIP would be a good 
first step and it should solve the problem at hand. (it will also serve 
as a basis for whatever other heuristics we might want to apply later 
on)

no, i dont miss that point at all. What _you_ are missing is the obvious 
solution: stacks on x86_64 are already linked to each other, via 
fixed-position pointers at the end of the stackpages. So the unwinder 
can easily check whether the 'next stack' as suggested by the link at 
the end of the page is indeed the same as the unwind jumpout does. If 
not => fallback.
same for i386 - there too the stacks are linked via non-unwind data. The 
unwinder can do a pretty good verification of the jumpout.
