Subject: why is asm-parisc/ioctl.h subtly different from asm-generic/ioctl.h?

  just noticed that parisc's ioctl.h file, rather than simply
including asm-generic/ioctl.h, has its own copy whose sole
(meaningful) difference from the generic one is:
$ diff include/{asm-generic,asm-parisc}/ioctl.h
...
41,42c54,55
< #define _IOC_WRITE    1U
< #define _IOC_READ     2U
---
> #define _IOC_WRITE    2U
> #define _IOC_READ     1U
 so parisc is identical except that it switches the meaning of the
direction field?  is there a reason for this?  just curious.
