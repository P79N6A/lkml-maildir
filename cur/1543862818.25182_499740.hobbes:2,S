flush_workqueue() also calls run_workqueue().

work->func() sleeps/freezed. We can't move the rest of pending jobs before
it completes. This will break flush_workxxx. And no, this is not because
we use barriers now.

Yes, we need the additional bitmap. This is optimization, we can just use
cpu_possible_map. create_workqueue() can use cpu_online_map + "int new_cpu".
Yes, this is a complication. But still this is much simpler (IMHO) than
we have now. And imho better.

Yes, yes, yes, let's see the code first! :) Then we can compare.
Right now:
	- cpu-hotplug doesn't use freezer yet
	- all ideas about using it to improve workqueue.c were wrong

Honestly, I can't understand your point. Why it will get replicated?
Because another subsystem will need cpu_populated_map too? We can remove
"static" and move cpu_populated_map to kernel/cpu.c then.
Btw, I agree it is good to have a sleeping lock to protect cpu_online_map.
But it should be separate from workqueue_mutex, and it is not needed for
create/destroy/flush funcs.
