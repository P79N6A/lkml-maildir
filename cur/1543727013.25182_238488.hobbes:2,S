If root wants to screw over a user, there's nothing we
can do.  I am not worried about the scenario you describe
because hugetlbfs seems to be used only by Oracle anyway,
so you won't run into issues like you describe.
It would be different for a general purpose filesystem,
but I'd like to see a usage case for your scenario before
making the code overly complex.
