This is all used on ram based filesystems right, they all have
BDI_CAP_NO_WRITEBACK afaik, so page_mkclean will never get called
anyway. Mlock doesn't avoid getting page_mkclean called.
Those who use this on a 'real' filesystem will get hit in the face by a
linear scanning page_mkclean(), but AFAIK nobody does this anyway.
Restricting it to root for such filesystems is unwanted, that'd severely
handicap both UML and Oracle as I understand it (are there other users
of this feature around?)
msync() might never get called and then we're back with the old
behaviour where we can surprise the VM with a ton of dirty pages.

Right, on first glance it doesn't look to be too bad, but I should take
a closer look.
