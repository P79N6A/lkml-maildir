Sure. I'm doing this as part of my GSoC application (well, I haven't
been accepted yet). I had also proposed this to Pekka Enberg, my
mentor, but he was reluctant to hack the relay code more invasively. Now
that you agree with this, I'll work on it.
kmalloc() doesn't work before kmem_cache_init() and relay code uses
kmalloc(), not vmalloc(), IIRC.
I would go another way. Have the relay client call __get_free_pages()
or similar function, allocate the buffer and pass it on to a variant of
relay_open(), let's name it relay_early_open(). __get_free_pages() can
be used before kmem_cache_init() as far as I know. No free is required,
since early tracing code implies it's built into the kernel and not as
a module. What do you say?
Will you merge this or wait until I finish the very early tracing stuff?
Cheers,
Eduard
