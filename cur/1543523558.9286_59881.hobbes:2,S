The problem in this case is that schedule() may be called
from within get_page(GFP_KERNEL). This already was possible
in 2.2.14 and before (if the task had to wait for I/O on
try_to_free_pages()), but the explicit schedule() in my
stuff in 2.2.15pre4 amplified the problem and made it
visible.
A fix for this problem is in one of my other emails and
at my web page:
