Subject: 2.5.34 reverses order of IDE disk drives

	I have a computer with an IDE disk drive as master on the
primary interface, and another IDE disk drive as slave on the
secondary interface.  Under all kernels through 2.5.33, the
first disk appears as /dev/discs/disc0/disc, and the second
one is /dev/discs/disc1/disc.  Under 2.5.34, they appear to
be reversed.
	I understand that Jens is submitting a port of Alan and
Andre's IDE updates, so I'm tempted to just wait and see if the
problem goes away as a side-effect of that update.  However, I figure
I ought to at least mention it in case it rings a bell for anyone.
