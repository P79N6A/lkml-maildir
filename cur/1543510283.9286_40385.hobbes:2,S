Seems good. ltmodems really should be enough for you. (Well, once we
get ring detection running :-). Any other voice modem will do the job,
too ;-) [you really do not need to run ltmodem in initial
versions]. So feel free to build that h323 gateway... I'm looking
forward for first real life use of ltmodem.
