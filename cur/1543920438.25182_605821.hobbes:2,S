One small change - I intend to remove the name and owner fields from
struct of_platform_driver, so you should not bother initialising the name
field and just initialise the name field of the embedded struct
device_driver instead.  This, of course, means that you don't need
	drv->driver.name = drv->name;
in ibmebus_register_driver.
Sorry for not picking this up earlier.
