Thanks, I'll fix that.

Yes, but there isn't much we can to about it.  If a program doesn't have
valid frame pointers then we just won't be able to capture a valid
address of where the program made the syscall from.  There are
plenty of paranoia checks to limit the search through the frames (even
with non-existent frame pointers), so this won't be catastrophic.
It looks like I could add one more paranoia check for the initial
value of regs->ARM_fp.
