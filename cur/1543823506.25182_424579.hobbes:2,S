I must also note that this is wrong. Many VNC implementations come with the 
Xvnc server (a drop-in replacement for X, headless) and there's the xf4vnc 
project which provides a few pseudo-devices for a regular X session and hooks 
into the video updates (which are then sent via VNC as well as directly to 
your video hardware).
