Oh, fsck! OK, I see what happens. get_fs_type() grabs the reference to
module (as it should). However, we call it in sys_mount() and then in
do_mount(). Reference obtained in the latter is properly handled, no
problems here (either retained or dropped, depending on results of
->read_super()). But reference from call in sys_mount() is a leak.
And since you didn't say -o ro mount(8) called mount(2) twice. Resulting
in reference counter 3: 1 from successful mount + 2 leaked.
Oh, well... Fix being:
