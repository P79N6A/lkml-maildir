If your comment here was in reply to my general comment about resierfs 
stability and not the specific hibernation issue the OP was having, 
please edit the quote down to just that portion instead of quoting the 
entire message, including the quotes it was replying to.
I wonder what kernel version you are running.  Since you mention rpms, I 
will assume you are running redhat, and likely are using a rather old 
kernel.
