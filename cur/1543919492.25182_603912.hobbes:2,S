Does a technical review include a review of licensing and copyright
issues?  (It doesn't seem to be a big issue though if the submitter
signed off on it, like he should.)

Anybody in the patch forwarding chain (author, maintainers... usually
the latter) can add Acked-by and Tested-by, based on incoming feedback.
The feedback may have explicitly stated an Acked-by or Tested-by or may
have said something equivalent.  (In case of Tested-by, an appropriate
description of how was tested should have been sent.  An explicit
Tested-by from the tester himself is moot then.)
Reviewed-by is a different beast.  If Jon's definition of Reviewed-by
(or another definition) is "officially" adopted, people in the patch
forwarding chain should only add this tag if the reviewer sent it
explicitly in his response.  Unlike with Acked-by and Tested-by, we must
not guess whether a reviewer wants to have his Reviewed-by added.

Being sure of something and making guarantees are different things.
