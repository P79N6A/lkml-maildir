Well color-ls just writes to stdout. It is not, as you say misconfigured.
It defaults to a crappy brown color for executables. If you do (as
specified) in /etc/profile...
	eval `dircolors` 
It only then reads /etc/DIR_COLORS and creates a COLOR_LS environment
variable, containing color information just like 'termcap'.
Unless you specifically alias ls as 'ls --color=no' it will generate
color. Since the shell doesn't reference /etc/profile, I can't turn
off its defaults. A previous version of 'color-ls' worked fine because
if defaulted to no color. I updated to the latest version so I could
get rid of the last of my 'a.out' binaries. This is how I discovered
the problem.
Shell scripts should minimize the use of tools, so I think that
removing 'ls' is a good thing.
Cheers,
