Hi,
I've compiled 8139too into the kernel, but the driver isn't started
when I insert my cardbus card.
I get the following messages:
Jun  3 14:00:03 laptop kernel: cs: cb_alloc(bus 4): vendor 0x10ec, device 0x8139
Jun  3 14:00:03 laptop kernel: PCI: Enabling device 04:00.0 (0000 -> 0003)
Jun  3 14:00:03 laptop cardmgr[540]: initializing socket 1
Jun  3 14:00:03 laptop cardmgr[540]: unsupported card in socket 1
Jun  3 14:00:03 laptop /etc/hotplug/pci.agent: ... no modules for PCI slot 04:00.0
Jun  3 14:00:03 laptop cardmgr[540]:   product info: "Realtek", "Rtl8139"
Jun  3 14:00:03 laptop cardmgr[540]:   function: 6 (network)
Jun  3 14:00:03 laptop cardmgr[540]:   PCI id: 0x10ec, 0x8139
hotplug can't find a driver for the card (which isn't suprising, since 
it's built-in).
Anyone got an idea? In 2.5.19 the kernel just gave me an oops
when it came to the point that it saw the cardbus card.
Regards,
Bas Vermeulen
