Possibly, but I wonder if this is a kernel-space problem or not. Why
not put all the smarts into userland for it?
    It will definitely fall back on the MII ioctls if ethtool media
    support for the desired command doesn't exist.
Well, that is more or less as much as needs to be done. That, and
some kind of super-set API to be defined for all new stuff, having
two slightly different APIs for the same things sucks.
