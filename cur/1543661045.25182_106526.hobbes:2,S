First, write_begin/end can only be safely used when there is separate
writer synchronization such as a spin_lock or semaphore.  
As far as I know, semaphore or spin_lock guarantees a barrier.
So xtime or anything else can not be read before the spin_lock.
Using mb() is more paranoid than necessary.
