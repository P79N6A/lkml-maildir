I do think that's what he meant!  I think most drives are optimized this
way, and performance would be better if the kernel used the queueing more
sparingly, so the drive couldn't just run with the writes and let the
reads take the leftovers. 
I think that's a better long run solution, although the fix addresses the
immediate problem.
