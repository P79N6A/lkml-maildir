As far as I remember, this happens when compiling with O=xxx only, ie,
only when specifying alternative object (or source) directory.  Normally
(when you compile in the source directory) they'll be like drivers/net/3c505.c,
arch/i386/kernel/time.c etc, ie, relative to the kernel top source dir.
It's because when you specify O= etc, complete source dir is passed from
makefiles, instead of relative one.
But it was long time since I switched to symlink-tree + compile instead of
compiling with O=, and things may had changed since that.
