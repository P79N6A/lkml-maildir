Personally I think it's cool for "desktops" and other reasons because:
-It could replace gnome-vfs AND kioslaves by a more generic solution that works
 for all environments
-You could implement several "not-performance-critical" filesystems (fat,
 isofs) with FUSE to avoid possible security issues. Give that nowadays 
 usb sticks and cd/dvds are so common it'd be possible to modify a filesystem
 on purpose to crash the kernel if a bug were found in those filesytems. With
 FUSE that posibility decreases.
-Since you can use other programming languages, I suposse it'd be easier for
 people to write support for weird filesystems.
-Better for kernel (less code to maintain given a big number of filesystems)
 and less pressure for VFS developers when making big changes to the VFS.
-Possibility to write stupid filesystems like "gmailfs".
