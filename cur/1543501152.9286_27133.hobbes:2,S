   It is time for the herd to move, it can follow me if it wants to.
And if nobody does, you have no users, then where are you and what is
your work worth besides your own personal intellectual pleasure?
(BTW I have nothing against pure research, it's valuable, but
 reiserfs is claiming to try to be something more than that)
This is where practicality comes into play.  Saying things like "oh
we'll break NFS and NFS must change to suit us" is one good way to
disappear quickly into being no more than an intellectual curiosity.
I have nothing against your work at all, I'm just suggesting that you
should start to be practical if you want the largest number of people
to gain from it and actually use it.
