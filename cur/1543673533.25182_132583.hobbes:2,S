I thought checkpointing usually takes the whole virtual memory of the
process, regardless of whats in swap and whats in real memory, in which
case the encrypted swap key is not an issue.  If this isn't the case, I
guess the random key has to be preserved as a part of the checkpointing.
Of course, this beats the whole purpose of encrypted swap unless
checkpointing is done into an encrypted device too.  This device must be
encrypted anyway, regardless of swap, because the whole process image will
be stored there.
