Does the system have any BIOS settings to enable/disable the floppy?
Is the floppy physically present on the system?
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKD] (IRQs 3 4 5 *6 7 10 11 12 14 15)
        ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKD] enabled at IRQ 6
I assert it is a BIOS bug for the BIOS to set LNKD to
IRQ6 if there is a floppy present and enabled; but fair
game if there is no floppy.  Though perhaps floppy.c
doesn't understand that.
