Cause I play with old toys, (floppys) and ivman doesn't work properly on the 
lastest gentoo with floppys, I retouch for a while the supermount patch from 
sourceforge for kernel 2.6.11-rc1.
I'm a n00b on kernel, I do this only for general purposes helping some 
friends, I know supermount should not be used, and is not mantained, I've 
tested it just only for IDE/ATAPI CD/DVD and floppys.
Cause Supermount seems to be a filesystem I replace vfs_permission by 
generic_permission instead of permission as I read on the lkml. Other stuffs 
too in scsi section (I don't have scsi hardware).
