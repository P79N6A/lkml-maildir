Subject: Why to I2c drivers not autoload like other PCI devices?

Is there some missing magic (udev rule?) that keeps i2c device modules
from loading? For example: the Intel i2c-i801 module ought to get loaded
automatically on boot up since it has a set of PCI id's that generate
the necessary module aliases. It would be better if I2C device's autoloaded
like other PCI devices.
