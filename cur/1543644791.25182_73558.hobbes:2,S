Right, but if the processes migrate easily, there's still no CPU locality.
Bill, do you want to try binding 1/32 of the processes to each CPU, and see if
that makes your throughput increase?

As far as I understand it, that won't help - we're operating out of pagecache anyway 
at this level, I think.

Policy is random - the scheduler lacks any NUMA comprehension at the moment.
The numa sched mods would probably help a lot too.
