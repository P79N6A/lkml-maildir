The problem here is that you trade off more objects (SLUB) against more 
flexibility (SLOB). We need some experiments with 4M systems to see how 
this works out. It may be better to be able to allocate more objects. I 
estimate that we will have a need for about 30 active slabs (note the 
low number comes about because SLUB will merge similar slabs together 
into one) on such a system. Most of those can have two pages. So you will 
likely still be better off with SLUB than SLOB.
