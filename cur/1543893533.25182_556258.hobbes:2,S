Thank you for the patch. Is there any way I could see data coming from i8042
when you press on these special keys? If you could do:
echo 1 > /sys/module/i8042/parameters/debug
tehn presses and released all these keys
echo 0 > /sys/module/i8042/parameters/debug
and send me dmesg I woudl appreciate that.
