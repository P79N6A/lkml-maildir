One thing that made it easy for me to add FreeBSD's accept filters to
Apache was because it is a very low-impact change. The code only comes
into action if the appropriate kernel module is installed, so I didn't
have to add configuration directives to Apache just for accept filtering.
If Linux always has the TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT code in the kernel then it
cannot be a run-time configuration option; it would have to be
compile-time only.
Tony.
