Hmm. How many different classes are there?
   POSIX - NTFS (should be), IRIX/Unicos, Solaris, HPUX
   Directory only - AFS/DFS, (does the Andrew FS fit here)?
   others?
   no acls - FAT16/32 ?
How many would have to be supported... How about supporting POSIX, and
possibly one other...?
Granted - one option is emulating ACLs in a file system that doesn't natively
support them is possible. One approach is to allow the FS implementation to
use a "reserved" file to store ACL information. This file might not be
available to users of Linux, but would allow for ACLs. I would not reccommended
it for removable media, since the media could be taken to a non-linux OS and
bypassed. Of course - physical possession of media invalidates the ACLs
anyway.
