Thank you all for your comments.  Patch updated.
=====
This patch export per-cpu CPU cycle usage for a given cpuacct cgroup.
There is a need for a user space monitor daemon to track group CPU
usage on per-cpu base.  It is also useful for monitor CFS load
balancer behavior by tracking per CPU group usage.
