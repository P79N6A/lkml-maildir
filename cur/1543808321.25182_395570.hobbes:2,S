Eh, I bundled two issues in my rant. 1) nsxfeval, which the ACPI guys
have confirmed is pure noise and can be forgotten. 2) "PCI: Failed to
allocate mem resource" which has been there since the commit I pointed
to, and never has effected the machine negatively (as far as I can tell).
So yes, 2.6.16-rc2 seems fine, and I don't patch it for that PCI thing.
It's just that the message is present and will worry people 'forever'
if nothing is done.
There is another issue, but it's not a regression. I'll file a
bugzilla for that in a couple of days. Or a week...

Yeah, I know, sorry if I jabbed too hard. I was caught up in a sadness for
anyone who's mail is ignored. There is a form of humiliation when that
happens on a high profile list like lkml or other kernel related lists.
A mirror of the defeat can be found on a small server in Korpilombolo for
the next two decades at least.
But I must say that during the years that I've read lkml, it _feels_ as if
the reply-rate has improved significantly. The list is not as terrifying as
it used to be.
