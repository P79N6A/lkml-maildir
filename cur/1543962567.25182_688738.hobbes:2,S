Beats me.  To pick one example:
commit 1a72963d3af38eb17a939fc19b322735da1c0aad
Author: Matthew Wilcox <matthew@wil.cx>
Date:   Fri Apr 25 12:38:41 2008 -0400
    Convert board-nokia770 from semaphore to spinlock
    None of the operations done under the semaphore could sleep, so a spinlock
    is more appropriate to this case.

There's no sign how that got there.  A bit of forensics shows up:
semaphore-removal       git     git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/willy/misc.git#semaphore-removal                                                  
in Next/Trees.  I don't actually have that tree in -mm, which is a bit
unusual.  Otherwise a grep for `Convert board-nokia770 from semaphore to
spinlock' would have found it.
Oh well, don't worry - I'll work it out ;)
