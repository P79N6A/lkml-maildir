SA> I'm running kernel 2.2.5 on caldera openlinux. I have ip-aliases enabled

SA> I also run ucd-snmp to retrieve traffic info for eth0 and eth0:1 (trying)
SA> I, however, cannot pull traffic info (packets/octets/etc) for an aliased
SA> interface.
Aliases are not interfaces any morem they are just alternate addresses
for the same interface. All the accounting is done for real interfaces.
All the packets/octets/etc go through eth0 on the interface level.
