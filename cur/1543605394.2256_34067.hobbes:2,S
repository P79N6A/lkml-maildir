You've given all the information for the case that works, but no information
about the case that doesn't work.

If this drive remains as ID 6, and your new drive has a lower ID, then
the new drive will become sda, and this one will move to sdb.  A possible
solution would be to configure this drive as ID 0, and your new drive
as ID 1.

What whould be really useful is the above message fragment for the case
where it doesn't boot, particularly which drives it's seeing and the
order it's seeing them.
