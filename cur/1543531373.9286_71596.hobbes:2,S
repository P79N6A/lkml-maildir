Hi all,
I presume this is already well known, but using the loopback device on
2.3.99-3.6 (SMP kernel on SMP machine) causes fatal filesystem cache
corruption. Sooner or later the process using it will end up in D state,
and a lot of other processes will too at some point, even if they are not
using the loopback-mounted filesystem.
The filesystem I was using was iso9660, mounted ro.
