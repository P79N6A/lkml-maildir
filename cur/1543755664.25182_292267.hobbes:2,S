Initial patches of kdump had adopted the same approach but given the
fact devices are not stopped during transition to new kernel after a
panic, it carried inherent risk of some DMA going on and corrupting the
new kernel/data structures. Hence the idea of running the kernel from a
reserved location came up. This should be DMA safe as long as DMA is not
misdirected.
