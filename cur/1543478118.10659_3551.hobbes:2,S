I was experiencing this problem with Netscape 4.5 and freshmeat a few days
ago on 2.2.0-pre4, and could reproduce it at will.  I did a strace and saw
similiar output to what you found.  After I rebooted to go to pre6, it
seemed to go away, but that could just be a coincidence, I suppose.
My issue with Netscape running under the latest 2.2.0-pre kernels is that
it still is leaking memory like a sieve.  There was something unique to
the 131-ac11[23] kernels, which seemed to me to curtail its memory-eating
ways.  I'm not overly familiar with the VM code, but maybe tomorrow I'll
experiment some to try and verify if that was just my imagination or not.
I ran 131ac11 for quite a while, and definitely would say that it felt
more "responsive" than the newer 2.2.0-pre kernels do.
