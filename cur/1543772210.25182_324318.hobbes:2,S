Mystery solved.
ERROR3:
	i2c_detach_client(data->lm75[1]); <-- HERE
	i2c_detach_client(data->lm75[0]);
	kfree(data->lm75[1]);
	kfree(data->lm75[0]);
The missing i2c_detach_client call meant that data->lm75[1] was still on
the list of i2c devices when it was freed. This was corrupting the list.
The ERROR3 path now works on my kernel.
Thanks for your help.
Andrew
