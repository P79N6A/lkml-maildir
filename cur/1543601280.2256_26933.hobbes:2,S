yes, but not necesserily so. If there is a physically redundant topology
of connections that are otherwise equivalent (the majority of today's
solution are not in this category), then it might make sense to 'load
balance' between available paths. We are prepared to do this,
architecturally.

yes, and this is being done currently, only the primary path is used.
