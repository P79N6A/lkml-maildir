Hi,
In the past few days, a couple of our webservers (dual P3s)
have started to emit $SUBJECT into the kernel logs fairly
frequently:

The machines are running RH6.2's stock kernel (haven't found
time to upgrade them yet).  One has been up 35 days, the other
4 days.
Should I be at all worried about the messages?  The source
around it suggests that it might have come from a dubious
header field in a received packet.  Is something sending us
dodgy packets?
Matthew.
