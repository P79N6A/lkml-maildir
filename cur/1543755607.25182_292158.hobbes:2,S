Actually, JACK probably is the most sophisticated media *framework* on
the planet, at least inasmuch as it connects ideas drawn from the
media world and OS research/design into a coherent package. Its not
perfect, and we've just started adding new data types to its
capabilities (its actually relatively easy). But it is amazingly
powerful in comparison to anything offered to data, and is
unencumbered by the limitations that have affected other attempts to
do what it does.
And it makes possible some of the most sophisticated *audio* apps on
the planet, though admittedly not video and other data at this time.

This is a bit misleading. With the right kernel+patch, Linux performs
at least as well as OSX, and measurably better in many configurations
and cases. And its JACK that has provided OSX with inter-application
audio routing, not the other way around. The higher quality of OSX
apps isn't because of kernel latency or poor driver support: its
because the apps have been under development for longer and have the
immense of benefit of OSX's single unified development
environment. Within the next month, expect to see several important
Linux audio apps released for OSX, providing functionality not
available on that platform at present.
