I was talking about the file system on the card. Usually, you've
got vfat on such a card. How about that?
BTW, You mounted proc on /proc and sysfs on /sys, I hope?

No. You don't have jffs2 on your MMC, do you?

Here's what I have (nodes created by udev):
# ls -l /dev/mmc*
brw-rw----    1 root     root     254,   0 Jun 29 08:41 /dev/mmcblk0
brw-rw----    1 root     root     254,   1 Jun 29 08:41 /dev/mmcblk0p1

As long as it's a reasonable recent kernel (>=2.6.15), it shouldn't
