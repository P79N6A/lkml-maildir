Subject: Reiserfs merge error?

I've just been reading some of the reiserfs code in 2.5.31, and came
across this little gem in fs/reiserfs/super.c:reiserfs_fill_super():
    sbi->s_mount_state = SB_REISERFS_STATE(s);
    sbi->s_mount_state = REISERFS_VALID_FS ;
it looks like a merge error; the reiserfs people should probably take
a look at it.
