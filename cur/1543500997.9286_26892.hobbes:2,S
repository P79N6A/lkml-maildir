I've been saying this all along :)  From the intro at
<
http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/perf-tuning.html>
 : 
    Apache is a general webserver, which is designed to be correct
    first, and fast second.  Even so, it's performance is quite
    satisfactory. Most sites have less than 10Mbits of outgoing bandwidth,
    which Apache can fill using only a low end Pentium-based webserver. In
    practice sites with more bandwidth require more than one machine to
    fill the bandwidth due to other constraints (such as CGI or database
    transaction overhead).  For these reasons the development focus has
    been mostly on correctness and configurability.
But alas, nobody really cares.
