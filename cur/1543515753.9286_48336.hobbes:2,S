Exactly my problem.

Yes, is there any reason why the driver should toggle DTR and RTS when the
serial port gets opened?
If there is none, I suggest the behaviour be removed or at least be easily
switchable. Disabling it with a speed of 0 is cumbersome:
1/ The first time your program runs, the driver still toggles the lines.
2/ If your program dies unexpectedly, the driver is still at speed, say,
1200; you have to open the file again to set it to speed 0.
So I don't consider the speed 0 thing as an easy switch.
Regards,
David
