   So I've now confirmed that my toshiba can speed-up its cpu under some
   circumstances. When it is powered up while batteries are low (<20%
   will work), it will start with cpu at 150MHz, and bogomips are
   computed accordingly.
   If I plug it into AC power, it will speed up to 300MHz, but bogomips
   still have "slow" value. Therefore all udelays are wrong by factor of
   two -- udelay(50) will only wait approx. 25usec. That seems pretty
   dangerous to me. Maybe we need some other source of short loops?
It sounds like you aren't rebooting after changing to AC power.  My
recollection is that bogomips are computed once, at boot time, so it
is not surprising that they don't change even when the CPU speeds up.
Perhaps a patch is needed so APM (or the user) can inform the kernel
to recompute bogomips, or to recompute them once a minute or so?
