/lib64 sucks, as mentioned, and I thought FHS only required that the
linker be in /lib64.  Thus, the actual libraries could be pretty much
anywhere (as it should be, really).  Debian-amd64 uses a symlink from
/lib64 to /lib and provides the 64bit libraries and linker in /lib (but
when actually compiling does link binaries through /lib64 for FHS
compliance).
Hopefully /lib64, et al, will die and multiarch will happen soon.
