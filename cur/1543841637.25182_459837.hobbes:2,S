Yes, I beleive so.

No, as per other email, we still need a multi-step process for
multi-function cards, and for cards that may not want to get
a full electrical reset. Finally, there might be platforms 
that cannot perform a per-slot electrical reset, and would 
therefore require drivers that can recover on thier own.
