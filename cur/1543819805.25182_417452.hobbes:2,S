Bit hacky, but given the chosen values of RUSAGE_*, it seems solid enough.
There is no way of doing getrusage of another process and its children.

Please prepare patches in `patch -p1' form, as per

should be

The parenthesisation is perhaps a little excessive.

This patch changes sys_getrusage() but not getrusage().  But there are
several callers of getrusage() in various dark corners of the kernel.  Why
do they not also want the extended functionality?
I'd be reluctant to support this change without a compelling description of
why we actually want it.
