Sorry, I really can't reproduce it; as I said, it was nothing unusual I did 
(with respect to loaded drivers, which I always have quite a lot of), and it 
happened while doing some editing in vi, which surely doesn't have any bad 
impact, I hope dearly :-)
But it might as well have been some cron job or so, I'll try to check better 
when this happens again. Any more debugging hints you could give me?

It's SuSE-specific I think, something to log boot messages to a console. 
This SHOULD have finished at this point, however - it's only needed during 
the boot process, so I don't know why this is there...

Can you explain that in more detail, what I should do and what is expected to 
happen then?
Greetings,
