ata2: port is slow to respond, please be patient
ata2: port failed to respond (30 secs)
ata2: SRST failed (status 0xFF)
ata2: SRST failed (err_mask=0x100)
ata2: softreset failed, retrying in 5 secs

 ===========================================
through traced the code, and found which caused it:
at scsi_eh_[port_no] kernel thread, it should reset the bus, before reset it,
it never check it if have a device. if it should skip it?
thanks
attachment is the patch
