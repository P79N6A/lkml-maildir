We can roughly group kmalloced objects into two classes:
a) intrinsically variable-sized (strings, etc.)
b) fixed-sized objects that nonetheless don't have their own caches
For (a), we can expect the size distribution to be approximately a
scale-invariant power distribution. So buckets of the form n**x make a
fair amount of sense. We might consider n less than 2 though.
For objects of type (b) that occur in significant numbers, well, we
might just want to add more caches. SLUB's merging of same-sized caches
will reduce the pain here.

Yes, that and task_struct kinda make you want to cry. Large-order
SLAB/SLUB/SLOB would go a long way to fix that, but has its own problems
of course.
One could imagine restructuring things so that the buddy allocator only
extended down to 64k or so and below that, gfp and friends called
through SLAB/SLUB/SLOB.
