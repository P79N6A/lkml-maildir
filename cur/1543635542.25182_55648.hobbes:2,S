Large PTE's aren't free either, though.  Cheap enough to implement but
there's some fragmentation that isn't easy to deal with in some
pathological cases.  The virtual space is pretty tight on some archs
already.
A lot of stock distributions load most drivers as modules so a machine well
stocked with devices may run into trouble.
} Modules can be mapped using a large PTE mapping.
} I've been meaning to do this on sparc64 for a long
} time.

} So this TLB argument alone is not sufficient :-)
} I do concur on the "ipv4 as module is difficult to
} get correct" argument however.
