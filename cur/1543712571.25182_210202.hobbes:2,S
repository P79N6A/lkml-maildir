This mechanism does not label all files below a directory as cowlinked
the moment the cowlink.
Therefore cowlink on a directory as described may be an interesting
operation but it is not an atomic snapshot of the directory and
it's contents.

Only if the following apply.
- A correct cow on a directory is considered to be an atomic snapshot
  of both the directory and everything below it.
- You break the cow on the directories on demand, as above.
Scenario. The directory tree looks like:
/dir1 (inode 1)/link1 (inode 10)
/dir2 (inode 2)/link2 (inode 10)
Then a cow link is performed:
ln --cow dir2 cow1
Resulting in a directory tree that looks like:
/dir1 (inode 1)/link1 (inode 10)
/dir2 (inode 2) -> (inode 3)/link2 (inode 10)
/cow1 (inode 4) -> (inode 3)/link2 (inode 10)
Then we have several things that could happen.
Scenario A: fd = open(/cow1/link2); write(fd, ....);
Scenario B: fd = open(/dir2/link2); write(fd, ....);
Scenario C: fd = open(/dir1/link1); write(fd, ....);
** 
In Scenario A the open breaks the cow on the directory, so that
the cow copy can have it's own inode as:
/dir1 (inode 1)/link1 (inode 10) -> (inode 11)
/dir2 (inode 2)/link2 (inode 10) -> (inode 11)
/cow1 (inode 3)/link2 (inode 12) -> (inode 11)
Then the write occurs the cow is broken and the tree looks like:
/dir1 (inode 1)/link1 (inode 10)
/dir2 (inode 2)/link2 (inode 10) -> (inode 11)
/cow1 (inode 3)/link2 (inode 12)
** 
In Scenario B the open breaks the cow on the directory, so that
the cow copy can potentially have it's own inode as:
/dir1 (inode 1)/link1 (inode 10) -> (inode 11)
/dir2 (inode 2)/link2 (inode 10) -> (inode 11)
/cow1 (inode 3)/link2 (inode 12) -> (inode 11)
Then the write occurs the cow is broken and the tree looks like:
/dir1 (inode 1)/link1 (inode 10)
/dir2 (inode 2)/link2 (inode 10)
/cow1 (inode 3)/link2 (inode 12) -> (inode 11)
** 
In Scenario C their is no open for the cow to break and
things proceed normally the directory tree remains looking like:
/dir1 (inode 1)/link1 (inode 10)
/dir2 (inode 2) -> (inode 3)/link2 (inode 10)
/cow1 (inode 3) -> (inode 3)/link2 (inode 10)
Then when the write occurs there is not cow to break, and the
tree remains looking like:
/dir1 (inode 1)/link1 (inode 10)
/dir2 (inode 2) -> (inode 3)/link2 (inode 10)
/cow1 (inode 3) -> (inode 3)/link2 (inode 10)
So I see a problem with Scenario C.   Perhaps you can refute it.
