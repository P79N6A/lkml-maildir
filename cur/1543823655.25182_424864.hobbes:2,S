  I find it quite disturbing that

So presumably the warn_on() call should be added back to the x86_64 arch?
Does that mean that the comment in the current code 
	* You must not call this function with disabled interrupts or from a
	* hardware interrupt handler or from a bottom half handler.
	* Actually there are a few legal cases, like panic.
is incorrect?
I did manage to find this thread; 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/12/2/209;
 which 
seems related..
Does is sound reasonable then to call local_irq_enable() for the scenarios 
where this will occur?  Specifically, any call to smp_send_stop() where IRQ's 
might be disabled may need that call to eliminate the deadlock opportunity.  
Or am I just plain confused?
