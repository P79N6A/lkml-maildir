One other thing to look out for is that Wind River also has a "long 
filename" FAT-like file system in which directory entries are longer, 
and which allows for longer filenames and case-sensitivity.
(Gads, I hate working with VxWorks. Wish I'd know a couple of years ago 
where Linux was going to be in a few months - I'd've never spec'ed my 
project to run under VxWorks.)
But yes, I would love to see a VxFAT module that could read WRS's 
wonderfully screwed up filesystems.
