I could, but I already know it's not going to help much.
How do I know this?  I already have 66% idle time when running
with my patch (and without Nick Piggin's patch to take the
mmap_sem for reading only).  Interestingly, despite the idle
time increasing from 10% to 66%, throughput triples...
Saving some CPU time will probably only increase the idle time,
I see no reason your patch would reduce contention and increase
throughput.
I'm not saying your patch doesn't make sense - it probably does.
I just suspect it would have zero impact on this particular
scenario, because of the already huge idle time.
