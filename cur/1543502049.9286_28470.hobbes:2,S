EGCS implements all parts of ANSI C++ language (temlates, exceptions,
namespaces, etc). But there are quite a few small places where it's not
compliant (something like "char *p=!!!1;" : "char *p=1-1;" accepted without 
warnings, "char *p=~~~1;" will generate warning and "char *p=!!!1;" will
generate error even if all three constructs are allowed by ANSI C++ :-)
Small and [usually] easily fixable but still annoying...

Yes, but still there are not "just a few ploblems are not solved" but rather
"some parts are done".

Sometimes MI is great but in most cases it comes from bad design, not from
real need. Mix-ins can be realized effectively by smart compilers (I'm not sure
if egcs is smart enough though) and so more usefull but even this technique
is limited...
