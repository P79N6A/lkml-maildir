First check /proc/asound/cards to see whether the emu10k1 model is
detected properly.  If '[Unknown]' is shown, your model is not
listed in the whitelist.
There was a bug that the front control conflicts with ac97 and emu10k1
dsp which was already fixed in the latest version (at least on
2.6.16-rc3).
