Not deeply but I looked your exception safe kfpu.
'kernel_fpu_begin/end' was like delayed FPU sate switching,
on the other hand, kfpu is more abstracted FPU semaphore
which works per cpu.
I have not compiled it but it should work fine on 2.4, but
have some questions using kfpu for 2.5.
 1)Is 'per CPU' safe for 2.5?
   I think the new O(1) scheduler has process migration between cpus
   and I am a bit afraid.
   If not safe, any good idea for it?
   May be per task could be safer even not optimal for smp?
 2)Need to add preempt_disable/enable().
 3)struct kfpuacquire {} kfpuacquire; is in the kfpu.h header,
   might cause compile problem.

No, my CPU don't run SSE......:)
By the way,
do you have separeted patch only for kfpu?
Thank you,
