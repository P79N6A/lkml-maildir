I attached the .config files and console logs.
config32/64 are for 1st kernel, and cap32/64 are for 2nd capture kernel.
kdump1.log is boot with nohpet on 32bit.
kdump2.log is boot without nohpet on 32bit and the 2nd kernel hangs.
kdump3.log is on 64bit. And the first kdump is failed because of
without noapic.
