On sparc32, all IO memory is above the 32-bit boundary. So it's
generally okay for that. The general ongoing work in the
io_remap_page_range() area to unify the sparc32/sparc64 case with other
architectures is based in part on the remap_pfn_range() work (as noted
by davem in another followup).
Unfortunately the effort to debug the effects of pending changes in
2.6.10-rc2-mm3 is blocking the io_remap_page_range() work.
