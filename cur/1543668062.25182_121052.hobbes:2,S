Subject: [patch] fix nsp32.c .text.exit error

In drivers/scsi/nsp32.c the function nsp32_remove is __devexit but the
pointer to it isn't __devexit_p resulting in a .text.exit compile error 
if !CONFIG_HOTPLUG.
The following patch is needed:
--- linux-2.4.21-pre6-full-nohotplug/drivers/scsi/nsp32.c.old	2003-03-27 22:35:04.000000000 +0100
+++ linux-2.4.21-pre6-full-nohotplug/drivers/scsi/nsp32.c	2003-03-27 22:36:14.000000000 +0100

This patch applies against 2.4.21-pre6 and 2.5.66. I've tested the 
compilation with 2.4.21-pre6.
Please apply
