Eh ... each bit of added clarity to the code reduces
errors.
Looking around the kernel, it really seems to me to be
a common coding to explicitly spell out enum values
when for some reason they actually matter.
Like most coding mechanisms, nothing guarantees anything.
It just nicely represents one particular detail, that
the values of these MPOL_* terms are not arbitrary.
