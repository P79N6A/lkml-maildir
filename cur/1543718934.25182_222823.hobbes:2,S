That patch had its first birthday last week.  I wrote it in response to
some long-forgotten problem, failed to changelog it at the time then forgot
why I wrote it.  I kept it in the hope that I'd remember why I wrote it.  I
subsequently wrote a best-effort changelog but am unconvinced by it.  Ho
hum.
Let me genuflect a bit.  I guess we can be reasonably confident it won't
break anything.
