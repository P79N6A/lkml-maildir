Hi,
	Just a quick question - I've used all four devices on my motherboard's
IDE controller and I know linux can handle something like 20 IDE devices
now. Basically, can someone tell me which PCI (or ISA) IDE expansion
card to get. The machine has an ethernet card on IRQ 11, Two SBs (on
IRQs 5 & 9) and the rest is kinda standard. What I want is a cheap card
which will let me add 4 (or only 2) more IDE devices to my system and
which will work with the described setup and Linux 2.2.12 or later.
Please don't flame me and tell me to use SCSI. SCSI still aint cheap for
large storage amounts and IDE may be slower, but on my home PC it is
sufficient. I only have 17Gb at the moment (10.8Gb +6.4Gb) + an IDE
CD-ROM and an IDE-CD-RW.
Could someone also tell me how the hell you can have 20 IDE devices -
how do you deal with the lack of IRQs, etc... - I'm *very* interested!
:)
Thanks guys.
Jon.
