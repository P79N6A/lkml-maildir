They should be replaced with BUG_ON() or removed.

Take a look at /sys/block/ and you'll see - when we register disks, we mangle
the disk names that contain slashes (e.g. cciss/c0d0) replacing them with '!'
in corresponding sysfs names.  So name_to_dev_t() should mangle the name in
the same way before looking for it in /sys/block.
