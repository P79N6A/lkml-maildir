Yep, our internal tree has both linux-2.4/ and linux-2.6/ subdirs, so this is 
handy internal to sgi.  But I don't have a big problem with the kernel.org code 
losing the indirection, even if we keep it here.  I'd check with Nathan first 
though, because he'd have to work around that difference when he pushes code out.
Out of curiosity, what's the reason to drop VERSION & PATCHLEVEL... seems handy 
if you have a common body of code that needs to build for various kernels, with 
various Makefiles to suit.  As above. :)
Thanks,
