That's a kernel timer.

yup.  It's been five years, sorry - I'm struggling to remember why
vortex_timer() needs to block the interrupt handler.
The chip is fairly stateful - that EL3WINDOW() thing selects a particular
register bank and needs protection against other register readers.  But we
should avoid running EL3WINDOW() in the rx and tx interrupt handlers anyway
- iirc the chip is designed to permit that.
Is tricky.
How come -rt cannot permit disable_irq() in there?
(I think the _reason_ it's disable_irq() is, yes, because it's infrequent
and because it can hold off interrupts for a long time if we use
spin_lock_irq())
