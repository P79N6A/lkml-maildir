I'd sugest "ro,noload" since the spaces screw up the mount options
parsing both on the command-line and in /etc/fstab.  So how about:
	Using the mount options "ro,noload" can be used....

The default is always specified by the superblock setting.  So users
will probably find it easier to understand if we remove the "(*)" and
to add the explanatory comment:
