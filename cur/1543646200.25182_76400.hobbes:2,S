Dear,
I am MR REUBEN SAVIMBI one of the favorite sons of Mr.JONAS SAVIMBI
(The Rebel leader) and also the head of the Unita Forces of Angola who was 
killed in the Struggle between Angolan arm forces and his unita
rebels On Friday the 22nd of February 2002. 
I am from Angola but currently I am currently on exile due to the War
in my country between the Rebel Group (Unita rebels) Led by my father
Jonas Savimbi and the Angolan Government. 
I want a trust worthy, honest and God fearing individual to go into 
business Partnership with and that is the reason why I have decided
to contact you. The fund for investment is US$45.5M (Forty Five Million
Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) and Diamond worth over 
Twelve Million Dollars. This fund was realized from the sales of Diamonds
during the crisis between the Unita Rebels (headed by my father Jonas
Savimbi) and the then President Jose Eduardo dos Santos Of Angola. 
I fled from my country with this fund, which my father suppose to use 
procure more arms for the Unita Rebels. This is because I felt that
the battle waged by the Unita Forces was more of rebellion and it was 
baseless. I had this fund sealed in a diplomatic box and deposited in
a private Security Company in Europe. I will need assistance from you
to use your facilities to effect the removal of this fund and
subsequently transferred to your nominated account in your country. 
This business has to be done in a more confidential manner. 
For participating in the business with me, I have two options for
you. You can choose to have certain percentage of the funds or you can go
into partnership with me for proper profitable investment of the money in
your country. 
Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. The money is 
presently lodged with a security firm and I will give you further
details immediately I hear from you. Please contact me immediately for the
next line of action then I will introduce you to the security company
where the funds are been deposited. 
I would like you to include your personal phone and fax numbers for
more confidential Communication with the Security Company. I will like you
to understand that I have no access to telephone for now so you are
advice to contact me through my e-mail address or my alternative 
e-mailaddress {markee_company@hkem.com}. 
Regards 
REUBEN J.SAVIMBI. 
(For the family)
