Yes, rather .rodata/.text together and .data/.bss separately 
aligned to 2MB.
But the problem is it would be quite wasteful -- even on a big 
defconfig kernel data+bss is far less than 2MB and with 4MB
pages it would be even worse.
I'm not sure that would be worth the advantage of write protection for non 
debugging kernels and for debugging kernels just using 4K pages is fine.
There's also the issue where to put the initcode/initdata.
