I tried re-compiling the .94 stuff as well as the .94-4.  Both the GLX
and the kernel modules.  I had to create the link for ../linux and ../asm.
The modules gives a few errors when I compile, but compiles and installs.
I get a Black screen and X blows out with the error I posted.

Seeing the problem in this case does appear kernel version related, and some of
the NVidia developers MAY be on the list, or working with kernel developers,
asking for advice did seem to be appropriate.
