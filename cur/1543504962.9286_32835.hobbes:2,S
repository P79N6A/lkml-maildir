It should be safe. 2.3.x (and I think the current 2.2.x pre-patches too)
will automagically notice the alias issue and turn it off, so gcc-2.95
doesn't have any _known_ problems..
There may be unknown problems, but so far I haven't heard of anything
worse than a few warnings that aren't right (and those might have been
fixed in the released version for all I know).
