a) Does a nzombies++ add that much to exit()?
b) If we make it a configuratible feature, you can still have a fast
exit()

Sure, you can make it even more reliable by looking at the 3rd field in
/proc/[1-9][0-9]*/stat. I'm aware about all these features.

"Just don't make zombies" would be nice. However, the purpose of system
monitoring (for which I proposed the feature) is to try and see if
somebody *does* make zombies: e.g. a home-grown or OSS application that
I can change, or a 3rd party application that I need to bug the vendor
about.

I can, so can you, and probably everybody else on this list. But there
are a lot of users who can not, will not or do not want to. And on the
side, it might break other scripts or features. It is just not up to me
to go into a customer site and start upgrading these kind of programs,
thereby imposing an administration burden to upgrade ps in future
installations as well.
