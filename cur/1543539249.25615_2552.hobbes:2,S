I have a general question, not meaning to be specific to you or your
driver.
With my current 2.2.x kernel, the only kernel command line (LILO) is
mem=256M and that is only because for some reason linux only sees 64
megs on my motherboard (FIC SD11). I have tried a few of the 2.4.x-test
series kernels and have found the number of LILO parameters to have
increased to the point where they will not all get processed- the input
line is truncated. Why is everyone requiring LILO parameters instead of
using reasonable (or customizable elsewhere) defaults? Wont this trend
make installing more difficult instead of less?
