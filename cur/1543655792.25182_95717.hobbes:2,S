Yep, negative dentries:
      dentry_cache:   149092KB   149092KB  100.0 
  ext3_inode_cache:     3425KB    10102KB   33.90
   radix_tree_node:      594KB     1612KB   36.88
       buffer_head:      543KB     1264KB   42.99
You can monitor these via /proc/slabinfo, or using Bill's bloatmeter
script from

I don't know what procps does.
But your fill-up-all-memory program will certainly do the trick.
Run it, create a huge swapstorm (or get oom-killed if there's no
swap) and then see what `free' says.  That's as much memory as the
kernel will ever give you.
