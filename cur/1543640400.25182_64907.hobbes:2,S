The kernel users of random numbers may be unable to block.
Thus the kernel has to have a PRNG anyway.
You may as well export it.

In theory. In practice what goes out through eg. the network is
most important. Additional accesses to a PRNG bitstream unknown
outside make it harder to predict the bitstream.
