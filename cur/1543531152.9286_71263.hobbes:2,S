its not unsupported, you can read/play VCDs using xreadvcd, mtv (www.mpegtv.com)
or the dxr2's dvdplay (with vcd patch)...
the more important question (for me) is, how to write video cds? i have mpeg1
video files and want to burn one....tried to burn one file directly as a XA2
track using cdrecord..the result were a lots of data overrun detected messages
from the kernel...
is there anyone who successfully burned a video cd and can tell me how?
bye
Steffen
