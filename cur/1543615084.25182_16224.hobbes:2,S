This guy is on the C++ standartization comitee,the book is intended for 
complete beginners as for advanced programmers - it starts with the 
basic concepts and goes smootly into more advanced topics, it's fairly 
simple to understand and the examples are staright to the point and well 
explained. Besides this, it describes very good the concepts of OOP.
Greetings,
