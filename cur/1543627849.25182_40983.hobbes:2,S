Compilation is already fixed in the current bitkeeper tree 
(linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.5). so you can either get that or you can apply 
the patch I posted this morning fixing this problem.
You can find the patch in the archives:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=101897350106638&w=2
Note patch compiles but is otherwise untested.
Best regards,
Anton
