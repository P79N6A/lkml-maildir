Well creating a new device wouldn't make linus happen right now. I do
agree ioctl calls are evil!!!! You only have X amount of them. With write
you can have infinte amounts of different functions to perform on a
device. I didn't design fbdev :-( If I did it would have been far
different. I do plan on some day merging drm and fbdev into one interface. So
I plan to change this behavior. I like to see this interface ioctl-less
(is their such a word ???). You mmap to alter buffers. Mmap is much more
flexiable than write for graphics buffers anyways. You use write to pass
"data" to the driver.
