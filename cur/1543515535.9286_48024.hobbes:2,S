There is no GPL conflict here.  It's Hans' code, so he may choose
its licence.  Since this licence is trivially GPL compatible, there
is not problem with including it with Linux.

This is called being copyright holder.

Of course it would.  Pedantic correctness is even better, but courts of
law are not, in general, sufficiently stupid that they would actually
fail to protect reiserfs on the basis of this.

No.  The GPL disallows _downstream_ recipients from imposing further
restrictions.  Since Hans' (and others?  Who owns Chris' code?) is the
copyright holder, he may apply whatever terms he chooses to the code.
Look at it not as the more common "GPL, but we'll sell you exceptions"
but as "Modified GPL".  In this case, the difference is small, but enough
to cause your concern and thus, perhaps, worthy of clarification.

No it doesn't.  In practical terms yes, that is its effect, however,
there are many cases where it is possible to link GPL code with code
under another licence, provided that _the union of restrictions from
both licences is no larger than those imposed by the GPL_.

reiserfs is not under the GPL.  It is under a licence slightly more
restrictive than the GPL (one couldn't link it with a kernel under the
free-BSD licence, or the MIT licence, where GPL software in general is
compatible).
Actually, this has potential bad interactions with the kernel - if
reiserfs is linked with the kernel then _as a whole_ the kernel's licence
become more restrictive than the GPLs, and thus reiserfs can no longer
be linked with it.  I think that perhaps Hans, Linus and some lawyers
could do to discuss this further.

The issue here is that this is in no way the intent of Hans' licence.
Otherwise, some unscrupulous company could link it with FreeBSD, turn the
prouct into a NetApp filer-style appliance (say) and give back only the
FreeBSD linkage.  Which the FreeBSD people would have little use for
anyway, since they don't like GPL code in their core.
It seems that tyou have spotted a problem - not with Hans' licence (which 
he is entitled to choose) but with its potential linkage with the Linux
kernel.
Personally, I think that Hans' licence unifies the intent of the GPL with
some fairly practical modern additions, and would have no particular
problem seeing the whole of the kernel under these conditions.
