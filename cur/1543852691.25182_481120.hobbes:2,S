---------------------------
The problem is because of race window. When if(expand) block is executed in dup_fd 
unlocking of oldf->file_lock give a window for fdtable in oldf to be
modified. So actual open_files in oldf may not match with open_files
variable.
This is the debug patch to fix the problem
