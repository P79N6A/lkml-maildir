You do not need to be subscribed to this mailing list, or any mailing
list at vger.kernel.org, in order to post messages to them.
If all you need is a simple answer to a question, or have a bug to
report, but otherwise have no interest in reading the hundreds and
hudreds of postings linux-kernel has every day, it's often better to
not subscribe.
