Hi,
I noticed you recently changed the way you handle SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED macro.
Former version was something like that:
#define SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED(lockname) \
	(spinlock_t) { { __SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED(lockname) } }
while current version is:
# define SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED \
	(spinlock_t) { { __SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED } }
I noticed your 2.6.16-rt6 patch includes two calls to
SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED(lockname) macro, the first one in
arch/powerpc/kernel/rtas.c and the last one in
include/asm-powerpc/rwsem.h.
Is this the right behaviour?
Regards,
