Thank you very much for alerting me of omap case, I missed it.
Drivers that use complex values in their keymap tables should not use
input->keycode, keycodesize and keycodemax. These fields are only used
by input core if the driver relies on default implementation of
getkeycode() and setkeycode() for manipulations with its keymap. But
this will not work in your case (nor with omap) because your keymap
table does not contain "pure" input keycodes.
Well, I guess the easiest is just not set these fields (and remove the
per-device map allocationand copying) and say that the driver does not
support altering keymaps. After all, like you said, it is an embedded
platform and it is unlikely that users will want to alter keymaps.
However, if you think that this is a nice feature, then you either
need to rethink how you handle your keymap of implement custom
getkeycode and setkeycode methods in your driver. The coice is yours,
I will gladly accept either version of drver.
