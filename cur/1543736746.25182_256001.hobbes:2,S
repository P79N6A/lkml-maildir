 The local APIC NMI watchdog has limited capabilities.  It may fail to 
trigger for certain lockups because there is no available event that would 
happen periodically regardless of the CPU state.  I can only suspect what 
"lockupcli" does (where is it available from, anyway?), but if it runs 
"cli; hlt", then the watchdog *will* fail.

 Too bad.  The I/O APIC watchdog triggers regardless of the CPU state and
works as long as the chipset is operational.
