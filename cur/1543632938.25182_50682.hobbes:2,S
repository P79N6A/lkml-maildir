I think that in some ways they were trying to simplify the code.  It is
a bit more complicated to do well from user space.  You're talking
dozens to thousands of process pairs, and maybe dozens of CPU's.  I
think the idea was that the scheduler has a better idea of what CPU's
are least busy, where to put the processes and indeed should migrate
tasks as necessary.  I just does it in pairs.  Keep em together is the
idea, rather than keep them in any one specific place, thus the hint.
I note that Gerrit replied also and as I recall he is one of those ex
Sequent guys who really knows this stuff, so I'll bow out in favor of
the experts. :-)
