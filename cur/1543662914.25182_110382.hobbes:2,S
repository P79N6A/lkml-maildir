Dear All,
I succeeded in making the target board booting using CRAMFS with 
initrd.
Since initrd will uncompress the image and load the file system to 
RAM i face the lack of memory problem in RAM.
So i just wanted to make the kernel boot with the CRAMFS in flash. 
I had seen the old mailing list archives related to that. I still 
have some clarifications regarding that.
1) Where to create the mtd partitions for the file system in 
flash? First i just want to create a simple CRAMFS with some 
binaries and executables and then mount it using mount command i.e 
like
mount -t cramfs /dev/mtdblock0 /home
I would appreciate if somebody could help me to sort out this 
issue.
Thanks in advance,
Nanda
