I've seen this happen with BIOSes of your vintage when there's a
"memory hole at 16M" turned on--the kernel doesn't see anything beyond
it.  See if you can get into the Setup program and turn that off.
Since earlier kernels work, the later kernels are probably trusting
the e820 tables which may not be set up properly...
