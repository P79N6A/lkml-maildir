I don't agree with this argument.  Code should never grab random
references without insuring that the owner of the referenced object is
pinned.  This rule applies to everything, not just kobjects.
Unfortunately kobjects don't have an owner field.  In practice this 
means that it isn't possible to pin the owner of some random kobject -- 
you have to know where the kobject came from or what it's embedded in.  
All users of kobjects need to work this way.
