Ok, I've been meaning to break my extent_map code up, and this is a
very good reason.  I'll work up a sample today based on Jens' code.
The basic goals:
* Loop (swap) calls into the FS for each mapping. Any caching happens
on the FS side.
* The FS returns an extent, filling any holes
Swap would need to use an extra call early on for preallocation.
Step two is having a call back into the FS allow the FS to delay the
bios until commit completion so that COW and delalloc blocks can be
fully on disk when the bios are reported as done.  Jens, can you add
some way to queue the bio completions up?
