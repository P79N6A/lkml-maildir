Hi.
    In hid-input, It seem we only call input_allocate_device(), but not
call input_free_device() at anywhere. Is there a memory leak here? Even,
I can not found this invoke in drivers/usb/hid*.c.
    Moreover, I found many usb input device driver do not call
input_free_device() at all, except when it failed to init itself.
    Are these purposely?
