No !
Please don't fix it this way ! The problem lies within the declaration of
SetPageUptodate() which it seems is a macro which lacks some braces somewhere.
You were very lucky that there was an 'else' to point it out, but imagine
what it would do in the following case :
	if (likely(!PageError(page))) {
 		SetPageUptodate(page);
	blah();
It would always execute the second half of SetPageUptodate(), whatever
the condition, and nothing will alert you.
What does SetPageUptodate() look like ?

I think that the gcc-3.4 fixes might have hit some sensible parts...

It's even later now, good night :-)
