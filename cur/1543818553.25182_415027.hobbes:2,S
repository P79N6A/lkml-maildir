I think allowing DMA mask range limiting in the IOMMU layer is going
to set a very bad precedence, just don't do it.
It's 2006, we should be way past the era of not putting the full 32
PCI DMA address bits in devices.  In this day and age it is simply
inexscusable.
Maybe we could understand chips coming out 8 years ago when a lot of
designs were transitioning from ISA to PCI, but that no longer applies
in any way today.
