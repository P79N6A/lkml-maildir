Subject: git bisect in 2.6.25-rc1 looks weird

I am tracking a performance issue of volanoMark with kernel 2.6.25-rc1.
As reverting patch have conflictions, I decided to bisect between:
Good tag:       6b2d7700266b9402e12824e11e0099ae6a4a6a79
and
Bad tag:        550ade8432a2a6fbfb48ba7018750b0e8c81e8d0.
#git bisect start
#git bisect good 6b2d7700266b9402e12824e11e0099ae6a4a6a79
#git bisect bad 550ade8432a2a6fbfb48ba7018750b0e8c81e8d0
Bisecting: 910 revisions left to test after this
[50d9a126240f9961cfdd063336bbeb91f77a7dce] Merge git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/herbert/crypto-2.6
By "git log", I could see 50d9a126240f9961cfdd063336bbeb91f77a7dce is committed
between 6b2d7700266b9402e12824e11e0099ae6a4a6a79 and 550ade8432a2a6fbfb48ba7018750b0e8c81e8d0. 
Then,
#git bisect bad
Bisecting: 429 revisions left to test after this
[95af8a26cba55222d6a1beda7970431b4fbbbdd6] V4L/DVB (6958): tda18271: clean up function tda18271_set_analog_params
By "git log", I couldn't find commit of 6b2d7700266b9402e12824e11e0099ae6a4a6a79 and
550ade8432a2a6fbfb48ba7018750b0e8c81e8d0. I find patch 6b2d7700266b9402e12824e11e0099ae6a4a6a79
isn't applied at this time. So bisect in this step looks jumping out of the original range.
If I just manually checkout to the commit point of 95af8a26cba55222d6a1beda7970431b4fbbbdd6, I
find 6b2d7700266b9402e12824e11e0099ae6a4a6a79 isn't applied. Command is: #git checkout -b test1 95afXXX.

Are the patches committed in line? or there are many paths crossing?
It looks weird.
