This is redundant, since cleanup() flushes the write cache. Also, I spoke to a 
Maxtor tech support person and he said that putting the drives in standby mode
does NOT flush the write cache. Yet another thing: you are flushing the cache,
by calling cleanup(), AFTER you put the disks to sleep. I think that's backward.
I guess the gist of my monlogue is: has anybody reported a problem that has been
solved by putting the disks to sleep??
