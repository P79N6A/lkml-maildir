I decided to run the standard kernel 2.2.2 in single processor mode on the
same machine that kept crashing with all the kernel panics and segfaults
in SMP mode and its been working like a charm for more than 14 hours.
I dont know if SMP is a direct result of the errors, or SMP just brings
out the bugs easier.
Hope this insight helps
