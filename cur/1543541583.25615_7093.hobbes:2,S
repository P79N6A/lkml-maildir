Yes..which isn't necessarily a good thing. For hackers, it's obvious what
it is, for end-(l)users, it's not.

# No need for a new call: just "ls file:*" to list the EA's attached to
# "file". opendir() should certainly fail - it's not a directory in any way.
So, in order to find out if a file has any EAs, you need to walk the
directory entries of the file's parent? Consider a directory with 2000
images, each of which has 4 EAs.. that's incredibly slow compared to
walking the list of 4 EAs associated with the file itself..

# 
# Yep. My approach has the advantage you can get "EA's" via ext2 etc without
# any change in API - cp WILL copy the EA's attached to a file, making them
# into files in their own right. Copy the files back to NTFS, they revert to
# being EAs.
Uh..cp will...if the user knows about them, and that they're supposed to
copy them when they copy the file (I'm thinking ext2 -> ext2, here). That
means the user has to know all about EAs and what they are...the nice
thing about EAs is that the user doesn't see them unless they actually
want to, and the association is managed automatically - your system breaks
that quite effectively..

Point well made.

# Hrm. Either that, or handle it in the same way as for deleting the file

Er. Hold on. You can't write to the file itself, but you can delete all of
it's EAs? That doesn't sound too pretty, to me.
