If you have no objections then I will make a patchset which do followings:
1. Remove  #if defined(CONFIG_VIDEO_V4L1_COMPAT) || !defined
(__KERNEL__) from include/linux/videodev.h
2. cover all #include <linux/videodev.h> with #ifdef
CONFIG_VIDEO_V4L1_COMPAT in kernel
By this way, we can satisfy both kernel space and userspace issue and
also get rid of above warnings.
If you have better suggestion then let me know.
Thanks,
