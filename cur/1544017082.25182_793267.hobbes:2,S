Hello, everyone!
I believe ACPI _HIDs (including PNP IDs) should be all uppercase, 
including the hex digits A through F. I would like to prepare a patch 
fixing all occurences of lowercase hex digits in ACPI HIDs.
My question: Can I send a single patch fixing about 90 occurences in 
about 25 files or should I prepare a series of patches, one for each 
file/driver?
Thanks,
