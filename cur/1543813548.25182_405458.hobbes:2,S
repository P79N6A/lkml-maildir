Fix pcmcia_device_probe NULL pointer dereference at startup.
Signed-off-by: Hugh Dickins <hugh@veritas.com>

This oops was in -mm for a long time, sorry, I never got around to
investigating it then; but now it has graduated to mainline -rc5-git.
It may well be a consequence of my ignoring pcmcia's "please expect
breakage unless you upgrade to new tools" - but I think this is not a
permissible kind of breakage, and my cards work as before with the fix.
