  Hmm, are the kernels really vanilla kernels without any patches?
Anyway the problem was that on the system with flashcard old data were
still kept in the cache for userspace (userspace uses cache independent from
the one filesystem uses), so it could be anything starting by different
amount of memory and ending at a different timing/command sequence
whatever...

Its NOT a vanilla kernel. I patched it with some local ppp and crypto patch, 
turned on couple of kernel options and nothing else.
The same patched kernel works fine (as described earlier in mail) on a 
normal Redhat 7.2 box.

  Ok, that won't harm the filesystem but you can still see errors which
are not on the filesystem (because of the cache issues).
