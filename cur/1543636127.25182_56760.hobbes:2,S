IIRC
    I/O -- A ------ B ------ E ------ G -- I/O
           |          \    /          |
           |           \  /           |
           |            XX            |
           |           /  \           |
           |          /    \          |
    I/O -- C ------ D ------ F ------ H -- I/O
Where B is connected to F and D to E.  Obviously this
setup has a maximum hop count of 3 from any cpu to any
other cpu, as opposed to a maximum hop count of 4 for
the simple ladder.
