This is not a good thing to be doing.  You should add this task to a
waitqueue and then sleep.  Make the code which causes event() to come true
deliver a wake_up to that waitqueue.  There are many examples of this in
the kernel.
If the hardware only supports polling then gee, you'd be best off spinning
for a few microseconds then fall into a schedule_timeout(1) polling loop. 
Or something like that.  Or make the hardware designer write the damn
driver.

As you have it, you may as well be calling schedule() inside that loop. 
You _have_ to be in state TASK_RUNNING, else you'll sleep forever.
