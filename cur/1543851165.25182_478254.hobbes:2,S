Status     : submitter was asked to bisect
It seems to be completely unrelated (except that it's also a ThinkPad), 
but it might be worth a try whether a (non-SMP) kernel without APIC 
support fixes the issues after resume.
Hugh, your laptop seems to be a non-SMP laptop.
Do you have APIC enabled, and if yes does disabling help?
