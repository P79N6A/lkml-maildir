The patches indeed were reviewed and changes made in response to the
reviews.  The philosophical/design question about whether or not
optional features which, if enabled, would prevent older kernels to
mount the filesystem was not asked, no.  But that doesn't mean that
the code was not reviewed; it was.
I would also note that we didn't intimate that we knew better than the
reviewers, or question their motives, or otherwise insult the
reviewers such that they might decide they have better things to do
than to review our patches, and that might have had something to do
with how the code got in relatively painlessly....
