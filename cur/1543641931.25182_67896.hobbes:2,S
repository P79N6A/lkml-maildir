Yes, I do have synchronization - locks are/can be shared between both
kernels using a device driver mechanism that I implemented. That is
to say, I can guarantee that atomic operations by each kernel do not
overlap "on the device", and remain locally ordered at least (and
hopefully globally, if I get the time thing right).
It's not that hard - the locks are held on the remote disk by a
"guardian" driver, to which the drivers on both of the kernels
communicate.  A fake "scsi adapter", if you prefer.

I don't think so. I think you're not convinced either! But
I would really like it if you could put your finger on an
overriding objection.
