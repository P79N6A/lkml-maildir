Don't think of it as a complaint. I'm sorry if it came off that way. It's 
anyone's job if they want to maintain any kernel release as long as they 
see fit.
I guess it's how we want to define ourselves. Was I mistaken to think that 
the -stable team maintains -stable for the current patch release only?

Well, that's the way it's always been. We have a late model 2.5 kernel 
that we still maintain in a level C avionics device on Boeing jets. You'd 
be amazed at how stable a 2.5 kernel can be made ;)

Nope, wasn't complaining. It was an attempt at a dialog to more clearly 
define our purpose (or perhaps my personal understanding of it) *AND* let 
other developers know what to expect of us. We can choose to take on as 
much or as little as we want. I personally am good with whatever everyone 
else is comfortable taking on. We should manage outside expectations 
though so you don't have to answer "why do you drop old kernels" questions 
on your own. 
Things have changed a lot with the 2.6 release series and -stable seems to 
me to be one of those growing pains that still isn't fully resolved. It's 
a blending between the traditional stable release maintainers and the more 
nimble release schedule these days. Can the -stable team fill the void, or 
do we limit our scope to certain patch releases?
