Yup, kthreads API cannot handle (properly stop) kernel threads that want
to sleep on possibly-blocking-forever-till-signalled-functions such as
tcp_recvmsg or skb_recv_datagram etc etc.
There are two workarounds:
1. Use sk_rcvtimeo and related while-continue logic
2. force_sig(SIGKILL) to your kernel thread just before kthread_stop
   (note that you don't need to allow / write code to handle / etc signals
   in your kthread code -- force_sig will work automatically)

It should be easier to do it now (if you defer it for later, the code will
only grow more and more complex). Also, removing this gunk from
your driver will clearly make it smaller, and easier for us to review :-)

The simplistic problems I initially thought your driver suffered from turned
out to be not so true, actually -- like Kyle mentioned, your driver is in
proper macro hell. Please get rid of as many as possible, and replace
with functions, as applicable.
