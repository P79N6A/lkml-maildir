Hmm, The pending owner logic in __down_trylock uses the grab_lock
function. It doesn't need the capture_lock since it never sleeps. I'm
downloading your 42-00-experimental now and installing it to see if I
can get the same message. Did you try the patch against 41-11? Maybe the
patch didn't go in so smoothly.
Anyway, I'll take a look at it now and let you know what I find.
Thanks,
