Then consider yourself very lucky - some laptop manufacturers play nice and 
the card reader identifies itself, and works as, a USB mass storage device; 
so it works out of the box with no extra drivers needed for either the card 
reader, or the flash memory card.
The Texas Instruments chip/ card reader that Alex's work here is currently 
aimed at does not - it has a completely proprietary, so called "FlashMedia" 
chip/ interface that talks to MMC/ SD, MemoryStick (/ Pro), and SmartMedia/ 
xD cards, of which TI have refused to release any specs.
Yes, this chip doesn't even use sdhci for communicating with MMC/ SD cards - 
tifm_sd (Alex's previous work on the MMC/ SD front for this TI chip) handles 
that.
MemoryStick support is more complicated in this case than MMC/ SD, given that 
on top of TI refusing to release specs for their own FlashMedia chips, Sony 
will also not release any specs on MemoryStick cards; the same is also true 
of xD with Olympus and Fuji.
