And somebody chooses anoter license, f.e see:
linux/drivers/video/aty/radeon_base.c

Alan *is on top* of (old fashioned, gitless):
$ for i in `find linux/drivers/`
do dd count=1 <$i | grep @ | sed 's_[^<]*<\(.*@.*\)>[^>]*_\1_g'

And what about linux/CREDITS ? Creating (even in the past) is also worth.
As Adrian Bunk noted, there are may who contibuted, still CREDITS has
reasonable size. Search above && grep in CREDITS 50 / 50 from the git
logs would be better ;D.
I would, say
      H. Peter Anvin, Vojtech Pavlik, Patrick Mochel, Pavel Machek
are also major contributors. Cheers, guys !
[i usually do credit search on stuff i read in the kernel, so that is IMHO]
