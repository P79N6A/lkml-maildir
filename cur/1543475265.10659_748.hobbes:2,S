  Are you sure?  I'm pretty sure that ECGS configured for an i686
will use a few optimized assembly functions that aren't on a i586 in
libc, which tends to take out a indiscriminate number of programs.
I got burned by that at one point so now configure everything for
i586-pc-linux-gnu (forget where I got that "-pc-" bit from) if I
want it to run on a i586 & i686.
  I don't think I had that problem with gcc up thru 2.8.1, only
when egcs started getting really optimized.
