That the load needs to be separate for handling panics is trivially
true.  I simply have a very hard time believing that the load you want
for the normal case will be the load you want for a panic.  I think
I want to be much more paranoid in preparing for the kernel to blow
up.  And I want to move data around much more carefully.  And that
care adds restrictions I want for the normal case.
So splitting it up to prepare for panic handling just looks like over
design.

When you can change the init setup with just a couple of lines of
shell script seeing if file exists in magic location (say a special
ramfs or tmpfs), I guess it does not look hard to me.

Right which is why I don't much care, so long as I don't have to test
reboot on panic any time soon...
I doubt we will see eye to eye on this one.  So I will now finish up
the patch to split this all up.

I'd love to make it simpler as well if I saw a clear opportunity that
wasn't just moving the complexity somewhere else.  But when I really
look at it I think that I am just wordy.
