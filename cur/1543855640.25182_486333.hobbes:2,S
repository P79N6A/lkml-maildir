You might want to look at some of the other warnings gcc spits out, but 
this class isn't one of them.
Other warnings we have added over the years (and that really _are_ good 
warnings) have included the "-Wstrict-prototypes", and some other ones.
If you can pinpoint _which_ gcc warning flag it is that causes gcc to emit 
the bogus ones, you _could_ try "-W -Wno-xyz-warning", which should cause 
gcc to enable all the "other" warnings, but then not the "xyz-warning" 
that causes problems.
Of course, there is often a reason why a warning is in "-W" but not in 
"-Wall". Most of the time it's sign that the warning is bogus. Not always, 
though - we do tend to want to be fairly strict, and Wstrict-prototypes is 
an example of a _good_ warning that is not in -Wall.
