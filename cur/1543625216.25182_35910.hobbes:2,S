I have reiserfs, but no hpfs partitions ( but yes, it is compiled in the kernel )
here the trace you rightly suggested me to produce:
EIP:
c012dcdc    00000000c012dc8c t grow_buffers
Call Trace:
c012c17b    00000000c012c154 T getblk
c012c358    00000000c012c340 T bread
c0182d0c    00000000c0182cb8 T hpfs_unlock_3inodes
c018ba6d    00000000c018b910 T hpfs_read_super
c012e739    00000000c012e700 t insert_super
c012ea8b    00000000c012ea34 t read_super
c010e770    00000000c010e4bc T schedule
c011b727    00000000c011b69c T flush_scheduled_tasks
c0105160    00000000c010510c t prepare_namespace
c0105254    00000000c0105248 t init
c0105688    00000000c0105660 T kernel_thread
my next step will be to recompile kernel without "hpfs" to see if it help.
 
Xtian.
