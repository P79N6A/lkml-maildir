Ok, it looks like it hasn't been updated to include the new-style EH yet
(although there are/were some that had both). Setting the option
"Use SCSI drivers with broken error handling [DANGEROUS]" in the SCSI
submenu will give same behaviour as that driver does in Linus' tree.
Ie, it will compile, but possibly not have any working error handling.
It should be ok for benchmarking though..
