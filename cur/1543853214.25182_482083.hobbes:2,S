Yes, I assumed you were running on a laptop...
These three measurements tell me that there is no significant
power savings difference between these configurations on this system.
One has to wonder why the hardware vendor supports C2 on this box,
as its sole function seems  to be to break the local APIC timer...
BTW. when I've had to measure small idle power differences, I've found
variance is smaller when I run at init 1.

1.
I don't expect dynticks to save significant power on the desktop.
(5-10% would be significant, 1% is not significant)
2.
I do expect dynticks to reduce the load on un-modified virtual guest OSs.
3.
I do expect dynticks it to reduce power on highly power managed mobile systems.
I believe that either #2 or #3 by themselves justify deploying dynticks.
