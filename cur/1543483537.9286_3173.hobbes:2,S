Then let me say "glibc as installed on existing glibc-based distributions",
ie. glibc-2.0, instead.  The question was about whether using lots of
fds would lead to problems.  The answer is that unless you are running
glibc-2.1 prereleases, then as far as I know rpc will still break: do
you have a snapshot of 2.0 which fixes this?  It would be useful to
have.

Does svc_run() etc. never ever open a new fd after initialisation?  If
they can, then we still have a potential problem.

Amen to that. :)
