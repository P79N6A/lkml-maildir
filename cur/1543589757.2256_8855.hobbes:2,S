Doug,
I guess I worded my question poorly. My question was around multi-path
devices in combination with SCSI-2 reserve vs SCSI-3 persistent reserve which 
has not always been easy, but is more difficult is you use a name space that 
can slip or can have multiple entries for the same physical device you want
to reserve.
But here is a second try.
If this is a failover cluster then node A will need to reserve all disks in 
shareable space using sg or only a subset if node A has sync'd his sd name
space with the other node and they both wish to do work in disjoint pools of
disks.
In the scenario of grabbing all the disks. If sda and sdb are the same device 
than I can only reserve one of them and ensure IO only goes down through the
one I reserver-ed otherwise I could get a reservation conflict. This goes 
along with your previous patch on supporting multi-path at "md" and translating this into the proper device to reserve. I guess it is up to the caller of 
your service to handle this case correct??
If this not any clearer than my last mail I will just wait to see the code
:-).
Thanks,
-Mike
