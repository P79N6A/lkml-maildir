They are not, the device file and the directory are different objects 
that have the same name.  In C, "foo" and "struct foo" can appear in 
the same scope but they are different objects.  This must have seemed 
to be a strange idea at first.  Here we have "foo" (a device) and 
"directory foo" (the device's properties).
When I first saw Linus mention the idea I did a double-take, I thought 
it was a strange idea and my first reaction was, it would break all 
kinds of things.  But when I started examining cases I was unable to 
find any real problems.  When I asked code examples of breakage none of 
the supplied examples survived scrutiny.  Then, when I looked through 
SUS I didn't find any prohibition.

Do you have the subject line?  It might save us some time ;-)
I seem to recall that the fork idea died because it was thought to 
require changes to userspace programs such as tar and find.  The 
magicdev idea doesn't require such changes, none that I've seen so far.

In SUS I didn't find anything, one way or the other.  I don't know 
about POSIX.
