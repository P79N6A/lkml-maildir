The normal process for submitting changes to the Linux kernel is by
submitting a series of patches, each containing a single logical set of
changes.  For example:
[PATCH 1/4] stex: white space/ minor fix(INQUIRY, max_channel)
[PATCH 2/4] stex: add new device ids
[PATCH 3/4] stex: update internal copy code path
[PATCH 4/4] stex: add hard reset function
Each patch may be dependent on prior patches.  Each patch should produce
a usable driver, e.g.
patch #1 must produce a usable driver.
patch #1 + #2 must produce a usable driver.
patch #1 + #2 + #3 must produce a usable driver.
patch #2 + #3 (missing patch #1) need not produce a usable driver.
This is analogous to a mathematical proof:  each step in the proof
describes a complete equation.
Therefore, to move forward, I would suggest that you break up your
submitted patch into multiple patches, ordered such that the PCI
bridge-related code is in the final patch.  This permits me to
immediately merge patches not related to PCI bridge stuff, while
simultaneously discussing the hard reset/bridge change.
Note that this is standard iterative development:
	1. 'stex' driver development, testing.
	2. Post a set of 'stex' patches.
	3. Community reviews patches.
	4. Upstream maintainer merges some or all of the patches.
	5. Go to step #1, perhaps to resend (changed or unchanged)
	   the patches that were not merged.
