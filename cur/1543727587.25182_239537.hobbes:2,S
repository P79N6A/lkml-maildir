Yes, while I support the current rework and de-templatization of the code, I 
don't support any attempt to split the drm modules to try and share code at 
runtime - ie. I don't support a core/submodule approach.
The arguments are pretty much the same as those against unbundling core mesa 
from the drivers - as soon as somebody tries to do an upgrade you're screwed. 
  Anyone trying to run dual head with different 'versions' on each head, 
you're screwed.
The last thing we need right now is a new ABI to worry about.
