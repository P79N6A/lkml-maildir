At 2Tb in a single partition you might well start hitting barriers. I think
there is a 1Tb limit per device somewhere. You also need to ask yourself how
long 2Tb would take to fsck on a power failure. Right now 2.2 doesnt support
journalling over software raid so that would stop you using reiserfs and ext3.
You might be able to do that with hardware IDE raid controllers and the like
such as the 3ware 8 port cards, or scsi raid controllers and then run ext3
or reiserfs.
2Tb you will be pushing the envelope with 2.2.
