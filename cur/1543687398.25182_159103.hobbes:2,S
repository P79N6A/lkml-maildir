In the BIOS, in 'real-mode' the head to read/write is put into
the DH register. This is an 8-bit register. Drives that can boot
(they boot using interrupt 0x13 to read the drive), can't have more
that 256 heads (0->255).
Heads     = 8 bits   = 256
Cylinders = 10 bits  = 1024
Sectors   = 6 bits   = 64
You get large media by translating to a large bytes/sector number.
If the "real" bytes/sector number is 256 this means that the largest
size media one could use (to boot) is 256 * 1024 * 64 * 256 =
4,294,967,296 bytes. A 137 GB needs 137/4 ~= 35  times more than
256 = 8960 bytes per sector or more.
If you tell GRUB or LILO that the media has more than 256 heads,
it won't (can't) write the boot tracks.
Cheers,
