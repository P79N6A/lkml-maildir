Since around 21:00 localtime (at least, that was when I first noticed),
my system clock has been changed to a different time, the changes I've
had are from 19:00 to 01:00. It only happens at bootup, and I'm pretty
sure it's kernel related:
I've set the time correctly in the bios. If I then boot the linux kernel
with linux init=/bin/date, it gives me a changed date. If I however 
boot to windows (it's a dual boot system), it gives the right date.
The strange thing is, the hwclock does seem to be updated because
booting windows after booting to linux (with the mangled time), gets me the
same time-shift as there was in linux. Is the linux kernel supposed to
update the hwclock at all?
My system is linux-2.2.12 no patches, on an intel p2-233 (klamath)(not oc-ed), 
on an abit lx6 mobo.
