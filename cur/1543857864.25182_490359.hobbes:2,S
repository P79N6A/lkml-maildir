How come atomic_set() on arm6 is implemented as:
	static inline void atomic_set(atomic_t *v, int i)
	{
		unsigned long tmp;
		__asm__ __volatile__("@ atomic_set\n"
	"1:	ldrex	%0, [%1]\n"
	"	strex	%0, %2, [%1]\n"
	"	teq	%0, #0\n"
	"	bne	1b"
		: "=&r" (tmp)
		: "r" (&v->counter), "r" (i)
		: "cc");
	}
Why LDREX/STREX and not direct assignment?
