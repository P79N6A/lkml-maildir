 I've made two new versions of the same patch.  The first one just
BUG() such cases, and the second one makes scsi_prep_fn() tell
scsi_request_fn() to kill requests instead of doing itself w/
BLKPREP_KILL.  In both cases, I made req->flags error case a BUG().
If you don't like it, feel free to drop that part.
 Oh... one more thing.  I forgot to mention the scsi_kill_requests()
path.  As it's a temporary fix, I just left it as it is (terminate
commands w/ end_that_*).  I guess this patch should be pushed after
removal of that kludge.  But with or without this patch, that path
will leak resources.
 I'm attaching the first version here and the other version in the
next mail.  Please let me know which one you like better.
