Greetings,
I'm curious about the mixed use of void* and unsigned long in the kernel to
represent addresses (as in tqueue.h vs. timer.h).  Is it simply a case of
author preference, or is it subtle semantics for the case where a datam is
most likely an integer value but _could_ also be a pointer?  Or is it more
complicated?  With the future in mind, what is recommended to budding
kernel hackers?
thanks,
-bp
