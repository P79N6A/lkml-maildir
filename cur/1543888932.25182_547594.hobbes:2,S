you might not have realized it, but the problem i think was the attitude 
you showed in the very first sentence:

AFAICS Thomas just mirrored that snotty comment back to you, and yes, 
when you are on the receiving end it feels nasty, doesnt it? So please 
restart and rephrase that into a more polite form and you might get an 
answer (although i certainly do not talk for Thomas). Something like:
> Thomas, could you give me a bit more information about why the arm 
> ep93xx changes were done in 2.6.21-rt6? I do not seem to understand 
> the reason behind that change. I've attached the change below. Thanks!
You are asking Thomas a favor after all... Be a bit more polite when 
asking others, and a completely new world might open up for you :-)
