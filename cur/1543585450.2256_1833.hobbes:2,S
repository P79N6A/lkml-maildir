Oh I know 99% of the processes getting this will die. The behaviour I'd
expect from vanilla code in this particular case (stack overflow) is:
- page fault in stack "segment"
- no backing store available
- post SIGSEGV to current
  * push sighandler frame on current stack (or altstack, if registered) [+]
  * no room? SIG_DFL, i.e kill
My point is that with overcommit removed, there's no question as to
which process is actually out of memory. No need for the kernel to guess;
since it doesn't guess, it cannot guess wrong.
Concerning the stack: sure, oom makes it problematic to report the
error in a useful way. So use sigaltstack() and SA_ONSTACK. [+]
Processes that don't do this get killed, but not because oom_kill
did some fancy guesswork.
[+] Speaking as a hacker on a runtime system for a concurrent
programming language (Erlang), I consider the current Unix/POSIX/Linux
default of having the kernel throw up[*] at the user's current stack
pointer to be unbelievably broken. sigaltstack() and SA_ONSTACK should
not be options but required behaviour.
[*] Signal & trap frames used to be called "stack puke" in old 68k days.
