Hi,
i recently bought the above harddisk as a backup medium for our
fileserver running Linux 2.2.12. After reading a lot of information
(howto, web, mailing lists), i am still not able to set up the partion
table correctly. The maximum size i get of the harddisk (whole device)
is 5.2 GB. According to
http://ldp.kubota.com.au/HOWTO/mini/Large-Disk-4.html
there was a 33.8 GB Limit in August 1999. Exist this limit still today?
Are there any workarounds, patches or a possibility to access only
33.8 GB?
Thanks,
Stefan
