  Sending one outgoing packet for every incoming trash packet to an

  Userspace handling is good but not best for such (I repeat) "weakness".

  I have an 100Mbps full duplex switched LAN connected on a 12mbps ->
  on a 33Mbps -> Ten-155. When incoming flood from hundreds ip addresses
  occurs (some of them spoofed while 95% of them not spoofed) hitting
  unused TCP ports, my machine starts replying RSTs for every incoming
  packet so fast that almost all the way to ten-155 is flooded badly.
  Of course I can still communicate with machines on the same LAN, I
  can still communicate (with big lag) with neibhouring LANs but that's
  it, no further.
  With my quick-n-dirty "dynamic firewalling" (if I could call it that way)
  I put a blocking rule with ipfw for every incoming packet for some time
  (about 15 minutes) and I remove it after. That seems to work but does
  not seem optimal as it would be , let's say, iptables' RST handling but
  with option to check if the target port is already "used". Which it would
  be much faster.
