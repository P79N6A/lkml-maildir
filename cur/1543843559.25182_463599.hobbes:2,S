And this flies in the face of all of those who, for years, have been
satisfied customers for ltt and who were more than looking forwad
for not having to depend on me to get a working traceable kernel.
The static tracepoints we maintained were *the* solution for a great
deal many people. As a maintainer I had two choices with those who
were not content:
a- Maintain their tracepoints for them -- not happening.
b- Suggest they contribute to helping getting a generic tracing
  infrastructure into the kernel and then make their case on the
  lkml as to the pertinence of their instrumentation.
And what I did is "b". I wasn't going to defend anybody else's
choice of tracepoints. Those who were using ltt for its designated
purpose -- allowing normal users and developers to get an accurate
view of the behavior of their system -- were very happy with it.
You want to know who was unhappy with using it: kernel developers.
It just wasn't geared for them. Which goes back to my earlier
arguments ...
