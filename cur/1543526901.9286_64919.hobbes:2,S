GRE tunneling and interface link state toggling work great in 2.3.46.  I
have a feeling that the new netif_running function change is the reason why
2.3.47 is broken for the link state etc.
I didn't even look into why GRE tunneling is broken in 2.3.47, I imagine
it'll get fixed in the next pre-patch for 48 ;)
