Er.
Sorry about bumping in, and I'm not sure I understand all of the discussion,
but this reminded me of an old issue with COW that created what looks
like a vaguely similiar data corruption on infiniband. We solved this for
infiniband with MADV_DONTFORK, but I always wondered why does it not affect
other parts of kernel.  Small reminder from that discussion:
down mmap sem
get user pages
up mmap sem
page becomes shared, and COW (e.g. fork)
process writes to first byte of page <----- gets a copy
Now we had a problem: struct page that we got from get user pages
does not point to a correct page in our process.
For example: if at some point we map this page for DMA, and
hardware writes to last byte of page -----> process does not
see this data.
So for infiniband, what we do is a combination of
- prevent page from becoming COW while hardware might DMA to this page, and
- ask users not to write to page if hardware might DMA to same page
  (even if its using different bytes).
I just wandered - is there some chance something like this could be happening in
the fs code?
HTH,
