This is done deliberately on some systems and is why we have the patches
I submitted to Andrew Morton which are in his tree and allow you to set
"panic_on_unrecovered_nmi" to halt on a memory error.
See the -mm tree. The functionality is there. Also see the various
x86-64 logging tools which can parse out MCE based reports.

EDAC has it enabled by default at the moment, although it needs to clear
left over flags and possibly a small blacklist first.
