It is a kernel bug, HZ is not exported. Actually two, because none of
the /proc should have used it as units, but that cannot be fixed anymore.
It is easy to add a read-only sysctl for HZ though and make netstat use this,
but this won't fix the trillions of other /proc parsers.

This can be archived by using a unit that is <= than any jiffie
in use, then you never lose lower bits,  just a few (uninteresting)
upper ones. ms is a good candidate.
