I have tried to search through the mailing list and it is not entirely
clear, but it looks like this has gone from the kernel: not least
because my driver reports:
drivers/sh/gdrom/gdrom.c:665: error: implicit declaration of function
'rq_for_each_bio'
I am not arguing for a stable ABI/API, I get that one - but is there a
canonical source of changes in the kernel (because unless you cross
reference lkml and git repos the mailing list isn't) and if there is -
how can we get it on the first page of google? :)
(Actually, forget the theologocal discussion, tell me about rq_for_each_bio)
