I wonder if the *intent* of the specification was that the low-level driver
should perform whatever setup is necessary to issue the command as given.
So if the command specifies a multcount of 8, then the LLD should issue the
appropriate initialization commands to use a multcount of 8, and then issue
the given R/W MULT command, and then perhaps reset the multcount back to
what it was normally (beforehand) ?
Ditto for the others.
I am *not* proposing that we actually do it this way,
but rather just suggesting a possible rationale.
What does the SAT spec say?  Any further hints as to the intent?
Cheers
