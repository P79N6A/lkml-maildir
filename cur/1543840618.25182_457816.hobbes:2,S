David-
I wouldn't have a problem with this.  In fact all that should be 
necessary is to export the tpm_transmit function and maybe a way to get 
the tpm_chip struct for the particular tpm you want since the driver is 
setup to handle multiple tpms.  We have played around with only 
exporting functions that were necessary (such as tpm_extend for work we 
have done but if there is a usecase for that it should work.
Thanks,
Kylie
