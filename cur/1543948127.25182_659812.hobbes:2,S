but the main and fundamental question still remains unanswered (more 
than 3 weeks after Andrew asked that question): why was this piece of 
general infrastructure merged via net.git and not submitted to lkml 
ever? The code touching -mm does _not_ count as "review".
Now that there was review of it and there is clearly controversy, the 
code should be reverted/undone and resubmitted after all review 
observations have been addressed. Just sitting around and ignoring 
objections, hoping for the code to hit v2.6.25 is rather un-nice ...
