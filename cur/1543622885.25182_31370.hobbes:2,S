I sincerely doubt that Rik will slow down at all when parts of -aa are in
the mainline kernel.  There is 2.5 to work award, and 2.4 isn't a lost
cause... 
Also, one has already been blessed, way back in 2.4.10-pre11 by Linus.  I
don't see any chance of rmap getting into 2.4 before 2.4.27+  Marcelo has
said he wants to see rmap in production on in -ac for a while before he
thinks about merging rmap, and that's good IMHO.

True, and by that token, rmap would be the larger change in behavior (not
swapping on disk accesses, etc ;).

Look at it another way, by forcing Andrea to send it
in as small chunks with descriptions, we may finally get a documented -aa
VM. ;)  So, lets watch and see that happen.
I don't see anyone benefiting with *both* of the VM enhancements as external
patches.

You will certainly find that here. ;)
