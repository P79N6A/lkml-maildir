Er...  We can do that, but current calling conventions for ->follow_link()
are already too complex (and we had bugs in that area).  What we have is
	1) you can return -error; then you must release nameidata yourself
and ->put_link() will _not_ be called.
	2) you can do nd_set_link(nd, ERR_PTR(-error)) and return 0
	3) you can do nd_set_link(nd, path) and return 0
	4) you can return 0 (after having moved nameidata yourself)
Note that in practice (2) is far more convenient than (1).  So pretty much
everything does it for errors and (1) turns out to be a source of bugs -
people forget to drop nameidata.  The only real case for (1) is failed
(4) - when we went too far and already dropped nameidata naturally.
Let me take a look at the current situation...
	* a bunch of filesystems do only (2) and (3).  That's the normal
case.
	* jffs2 follow_link() is broken - it has an exit where it returns
-EIO and leaks nameidata.
	* procfs special symlinks - (1) or (4), correctly used.
	* afs magic - (1) or (4), correctly used.
	* hppfs - badly broken for unrelated reasons.
Adding "you can return a cookie as long as it's not ERR_PTR() and it will
be treated like (2), (3) or (4), except that you won't want it in (4)" will
add to confusion.  And of course, we will have to update every ->put_link()
and ->follow_link() out there...
_If_ you want 2.6.13 with minimal PITA right now, I'd suggest leaving API
as is until 2.6.13-git1 and using stray_page_... + patch below to deal with
jffs2 until then.  Then we can deal with API change - immediately after
2.6.13 release.  Removing stray_... in process.
