Which would be wrong IMNSHO.
Please keep the current xtime centric implementation out of your mind. 
As I pointed out in the ktimers thread already the  correct chain of
processing is
raw timesource 
	-> freqency adjustment (== CLOCK_MONOTONIC) 
		-> wall time adjustment (== CLOCK_REALTIME)
This is the way all real world time sources work. Nobody screws on an
atomic clock because the earth rotation is not constant. Why should
Linux be different ? For historic reasons - because it was that way
since v0.95 ?
There is no performance penalty involved doing it this way. It just
changes the order of corrections. The performance critical stuff is a
question of implementation details not of processing order.

Same code in most other archs.
