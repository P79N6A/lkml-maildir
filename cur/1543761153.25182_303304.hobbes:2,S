My suggestion would be to break out the 1.x code into a separate patch
and encourage everyone to convert to 2.x. No one has ever created a
1.x fs with the expectation it'll work on an unpatched kernel, so they
don't lose anything. And no one should be creating such any more, right?

Minors are 22 bits, majors are 10. May grow to 32 each at some point.
