Does this count as 'fixing the drivers'?  It looks ugly to me, but it's
the only way (still using request/release) I can get parport_pc to load
after being unloaded.
There are mandatory registers (base .. base+2), and optional registers
(base+3 ..).  First of all, we check that we can use the mandatory
registers, and when we figure out what type of port it is we request
either 3 or 8 bytes.
If we requested 8 bytes the first time, the check_region (base, 3) will
fail.
This hack requests the region in two chunks.  Yuck.  Is there a better
way?
Tim.
