It sure looks as though the ethernet interface is generating an interrupt 
request before the de2104x driver has registered its interrupt handler.  
When uhci-hcd isn't already loaded the IRQ is unused, hence disabled, and 
so nothing bad happens.  If uhci-hcd is already loaded then the IRQ is 
enabled (because uhci-hcd is using it), so you get the problem -- an 
interrupt occurs with no registered handler.
