Just for kicks, I started with the DAC960.c driver (alphabet ..), and
it registered 6 alarms!

The ProcessCompletedCommand thing really is called under spinlock, but
it appears to be detected as sleepy because it calls kmalloc (and
kfree), however it calls kmalloc with GFP_ATOMIC, so it's not sleepy
and that's a false alarm. Ho hum ... I'll have to detect that.
The WaitForCommand is also definitely called under spinlock ... and is
thought to be sleepy because it calls schedule! Well, it calls
__wait_event(Controller->CommandWaitQueue, Controller->FreeCommands);
Is that going to schedule?  I suppose logically it should.
Anyway, that looks a legitimate complaint:
  spin_lock_irqsave(&Controller->queue_lock, flags);
  while ((Command = DAC960_AllocateCommand(Controller)) == NULL)
    DAC960_WaitForCommand(Controller);
  spin_unlock_irqrestore(&Controller->queue_lock, flags);
Looks like it waits under spinlock to me!
I'll go write the generic inference engine required to make this a bit
more accurate still.
