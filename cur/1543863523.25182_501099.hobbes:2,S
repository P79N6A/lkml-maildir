It shouldn't be outright implicit since it's included in clocksource.h .
That has to be included before you can create a clocksource. I could see
adding list.h if it wasn't clear which include was bringing it in.

I got that address from the maintainers file,
AVR32 ARCHITECTURE
P:      Atmel AVR32 Support Team
M:      avr32@atmel.com

W:

S:      Supported
I just picked the top address .. If it makes sense you might want to
consider dropping that address from the maintainers file. It seems a
little formal for submitting patches. In the future I'll send them to
you.
