Selecting the relevant patches to give enough of the container
framework to support a CFS container subsystem (slightly
tweaked/updated versions of the base patch, procfs interface patch and
tasks file interface patch) is about 1600 lines in kernel/container.c
and another 200 in kernel/container.h, which is about 99% of the
non-documentation changes.
So not tiny, but it's not very intrusive on the rest of the kernel,
and would avoid having to introduce a temporary API based on uids.
