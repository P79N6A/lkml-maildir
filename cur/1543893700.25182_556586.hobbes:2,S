Seems to be doing its job rather effectively.

include/linux/compiler.h ..
/* Optimization barrier */
#ifndef barrier
# define barrier() __memory_barrier()
#endif
We shouldn't be hitting this, because barrier should be getting defined
in the compiler specific headers above..
#if __GNUC__ >= 4
# include <linux/compiler-gcc4.h>
#elif __GNUC__ == 3 && __GNUC_MINOR__ >= 2
# include <linux/compiler-gcc3.h>
#else
# error Sorry, your compiler is too old/not recognized.
#endif
both of those include linux/compiler-gcc.h, which defines barrier.
How strange.  What compiler version is this?
