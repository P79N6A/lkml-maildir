Hello all,
2.4.6-pre6 introduces 14 new undocumented symbols.
Would the owners please provide help texts for the following:
CONFIG_CPU_SUBTYPE_SH7751
CONFIG_CPU_SUBTYPE_ST40STB1
CONFIG_HD64465_IOBASE
CONFIG_MAPLE_KEYBOARD
CONFIG_MAPLE_MOUSE
CONFIG_SH_7751_SOLUTION_ENGINE
CONFIG_SH_BIGSUR
CONFIG_SH_CAT68701
CONFIG_SH_SH2000
CONFIG_SH_STB1_HARP
CONFIG_SH_STB1_OVERDRIVE
CONFIG_ST40_LMI_MEMORY
CONFIG_TULIP_MMIO
CONFIG_TULIP_MWI
The SuperH ones are just items in a choice menu, so they can be one-liners.
Thanks in advance,
Steven
