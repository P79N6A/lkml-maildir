Firstly there is a magic 16 byte slop allocated to handle this, secondly the
IP code catches the odd packets it fails to cover and reallocs them to fit
the required driver headroom

There was a sign bug months ago with this that bit Alpha users for one. That
was fixed. Other than that we haven't seen anything. So right now I believe
the bug is in the isdn layers or whatever they call.
It could be a compressor bug, that is the obvious candidate. Do people see it
with all the compression disabled ?
