Does linux support NFSv3 as a client? (2.2.14)
I've noted /usr/src/linux/fs/nfs/nfs3xdr.c which apparently is old...
With all the work going into knfsd and getting an NFSv3 server
implemented, do we have NFSv3 client support?
I've tried various mount options (nfs.5 manpage)
mount -o nfsvers=3,vers=3 netapp:/vol/vol0 /mnt/netapp
This is using a Network Appliance filer, which supports NFSv3, however
the netapp is only seeing v2 NFS calls from the linux machine.
