Oh, forgot to mention earlier...
The machines that refuse to actually switch off all SUSPEND just fine.  
They'll power down most of the way and stay suspended on battery power for a 
week.
It's just that when you tell them to actually switch off, use NO battery, and 
reboot when you come back up...  Then they won't even suspend, they just stay 
on but spin the hard drive down.
Weird, eh?
