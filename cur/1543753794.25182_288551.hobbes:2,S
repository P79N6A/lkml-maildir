;) Are you sure you had 500m free even before the _first_ oom killing?
I assumed what you posted was not the first one of the oom killing
messages. If it was the first then there was a regression. But if OTOH I
didn't misunderstood your message and it wasn't the first, then what
you've seen is just the brokeness of 2.6 w.r.t. oom killing, that's what
made Thomas drive a few hours too, and you've only to apply the 5
patches I just posted, and everything will work perfectly correct then
in terms of _not_ killing right and left anymore, even despite the 500m
free ;). I tested the code before posting and my regression test passed
at least, so it looked like there was no other regression. The several
rejects I've got while porting the code looked all due noop-cleanups. So
I doubt there was a regression and I'm optimistic you've just seen the
old bugs.
