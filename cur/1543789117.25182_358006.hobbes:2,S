Yes, there's a bug in the opie (qte specifically) calibration code which
is fixed in 3.5.4 (I fixed it). I ended up replacing qte's algorithm
with a decent 5 point one.

Yes, place the file as gnu.tar on the flashcard with updater.sh.
updater.sh is indeed an "encrypted" shell script! There are tools around
to decode/encode it.

My spitz has been left plugged in all the time with my charging code and
has yet to explode. ;-) Its very similar to the c7x0 code which people
have happily been using for a while in OpenZaurus c7x0 2.6. Spitz does
contain a charging chip which should prevent major damage to the
battery. The software just tries to help it along...
Cheers,
Richard
