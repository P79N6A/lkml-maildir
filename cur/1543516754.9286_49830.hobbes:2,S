For my purposes, the "every 11 minutes" behaviour is great: I run NTP,
and it gets in sync a few minutes after boot (Just a few hundred ms
drift since last write to CMOS). 
I agree that for people wanting more accuracy, it needs to go. How
about allowing someone like that to turn off the "write cmos every 11
minutes:" behaviour?
