I'm not asking people to spend significant amounts of time...more like 
if anyone has any ideas "off the top of their heads".

I hadn't realized that you felt this strongly about asking questions 
regarding old kernels.
How close to bleeding edge do we need to be for it to be considered 
acceptable to ask questions on netdev?
Given that the embedded space tends to be perpetually stuck on older 
kernels (our "current" release is based on 2.6.14) do you have any 
suggestion on how we can obtain information that would be available on 
netdev if we were using newer kernels?
