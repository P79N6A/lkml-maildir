Hi Alan, 
 thanks for your reply! 
 Unfortunately it does not solve the problem:
 As long as uhci (or USB per se) is not present, things do work.
 But uhci/USB get confused and repeats the message (in my last mail)
 endlessly i fcompbined with APIC mode.
 Therefore it seems that APIC is working with my VIA board without USB.
 But I cannot live without USB ... my mouse is USBish and X without a
 mouse is a little ... hmmm senseless.
 Any ideas else?
 Keep Hacking!
 Meino
