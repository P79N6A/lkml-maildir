You are wrong. I remember the discussion and even gave an example as
1413 kB ( <1.44MB ) kernel does not build as bzimage.
Short analysis of
 arch/i386/boot/bootsect.S
and 
 arch/i386/boot/setup.S
shows that size of kernel to be load is stored in
syssize:
        .word SYSSIZE
i.e. should not exceed
(2^16 - 1) * 16 Bytes 
This is the limit of internal (used to boot from a floppy) bootloader.
I don't know if lilo/loadlin use this variable in kernel loading procedure,
however. If they use the code from setup.S to load the kernel into memory
the problem exists. If they use their own code - the problem probably goes
away.
Modification .word -> .dword is not trivial.
This kernel size limit is controlled during build process in
arch/i386/boot/tools/build.c :
        u32 sys_size;
[...]
        if (sys_size > (is_big_kernel ? 0xffff : DEF_SYSSIZE))
                die("System is too big. Try using %smodules.",
                        is_big_kernel ? "" : "bzImage or ");
[...]
        buf[0] = (sys_size & 0xff);
        buf[1] = ((sys_size >> 8) & 0xff);
        if (write(1, buf, 2) != 2)
                die("Write of image length failed");
sys_size contains value  (size of hernel)/16   rounded up.
