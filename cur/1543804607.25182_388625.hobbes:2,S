I currently have this:
scsi_cmd_cache    1458778 1458790    384   10    1 : tunables   54 27
8 : slabdata 145879 145879      0
in /proc/slabinfo, which is pretty close to 1.5 million. The system is
working fine but it should be not very loaded anyway, so a mem leakage
will not show up early. Just checked, that scsi_cmd_cache on other
machines of mine is under 100, so it seems like a problem.
Unfortunately, while being a programmer, I'm totally unaware
what /proc/slabinfo means, but I'm perfectly willing to provide a shell
(in case of Andrew or other famous developer it may be even root) on
this machine.
I'm attaching the /proc/slabinfo
Thanks for help,
Anton
