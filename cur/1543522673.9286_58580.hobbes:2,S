All but arm, i386 and m68k used 32bit type there already.
The only broken big endian is m68k, but there I think we should switch
to 32bit type as well, because all glibc programs would have to do
((unsigned int)si_uid)>>16 to get right pid if they wanted to work
previously (m68k uses int as __uid_t which is used in glibc siginfo_t).

Well, I think it does not provide you the rt signal syscalls, but you can
still call sigaction with SA_SIGINFO and look from the signal handler at
its arguments. But I think people rarely do it in libc5.
