That is correct, and something I did before you were born.
An extended partition is a box containing logical partitions.
It is almost always an error when people want to write directly to it
(confusing the extended partition with some logical partition inside).
After a number of reports of people who messed up their disk
by doing mkswap or mkfs on an extended partition I changed
the length of an extended partition to 1 block, enough for LILO
but stopping mkswap and mkfs.
People who really want to access these blocks, like e.g. fdisk,
can do so via /dev/hda.
