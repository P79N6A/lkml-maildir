As you say later you have stuff working in userland under DOSEMU (and the
"dog slow" part), I'd suggest a userspace driver. It is probably easier to
work with, and has the advantage that you can run it under the bog-standard
$DISTRO kernel with some care, no patching/reconfiguring/rebuilding to be
done.
