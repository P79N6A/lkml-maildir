Mmm.. okay, a quick glance at the USB storage code revealed one instance:
        /* Did we transfer less than the minimum amount required? */
        if (srb->result == SAM_STAT_GOOD &&
                        srb->request_bufflen - srb->resid < srb->underflow)
                srb->result = (DID_ERROR << 16) | (SUGGEST_RETRY << 24);
        return;
So I suppose this *could* be the driver thinking it had a bad sector,
but it really looks like it's guessing.  The code also appears to be
instrumented for some kind of USB tracing.. If you can figure out how
to turn that on, then the trace will probably tell us what is really
going on there. 
Look for a file called "usbmon.txt" in the Documentation/usb/ subdir
of your kernel source tree.  It describes how to do the tracing.
I'll also CC: you when I send out the SCSI error-recovery draft patch.
Cheers
