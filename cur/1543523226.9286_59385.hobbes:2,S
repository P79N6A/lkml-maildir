In case you are referring to the Hale Landis' "How It Works" documents,
yes, these are useful, although outdated and not entirely correct;
I do not think Hale ever described logical partitions correctly.
Maybe you never saw
	
http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/partitions/partition_tables.html
	
http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/partitions/partition_types.html
	
http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/Large-Disk.html
?
On the other hand, if you are not referring to the "How It Works"
documents, then probably I would be interested to see if there is
anything useful there that is not in any of the three URLs given above.
