inode-max IIRC is just the cache size -- if you /really/ have more referenced
inodes (+dirty?) than inode-max, the system lets you exceed the limit. The
gotcha, of course, is that the memory for inodes never shrinks -- inodes get
reused, but not freed.
However, there is a bug in the inode caching stuff in 2.2.1. It is fixed in
2.2.2-pre2 (which is in the testing dir on the linux kernel mirrors).
Cheers,
Steve
