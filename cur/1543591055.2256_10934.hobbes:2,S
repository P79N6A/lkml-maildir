To what extent do the code of the various drivers reflect that? i.e. is there
some code that is common to all block devices, and that is used by code that 
is common to all disk devices, that further is used by all drivers pretending 
to be IDE devices, which is further used by all code pretending to be EIDE 
devices, etc. ?  If you look at majors, say, as a binary tree which you 
walk in accordance with the bits in the major, can drivers nest like that?
I've wondered about that for a long time for various reasons.
