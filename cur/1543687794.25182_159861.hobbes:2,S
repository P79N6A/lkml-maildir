Subject: [PATCH] initramfs + sysfs as root fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/8/23/179

This is my first real patch, so please vet thoroughly
This patch allows a person to not require mounting a root device at startup.  
This works idealy for people trying to use the initramfs/sysfs as the only 
filesystem.
What happens is that when the root device is set to 0,0 mount_root is not 
called.  I have tested in VMWare extensively, and the patch is quite minimal.
Please let me know if I should send this somewhere else as well.
Also, please be adviased that I did not dream up the goto - I am just keeping 
in line with the existing file structure.
