Hello,
Next time, please do a reply-all so CC's aren't dropped.
It seems you jumped halfway in, missing some background info, I'll try to
clarify some things.

He is correct, I only argued that's it can still be named RSA (which Satyam
disputed), no matter what critical features are missing for a complete
infrastructure.
I don't know if you read the patch, but right now it's only a multi-precision
integer implementation, useful to implement RSA. The rest, including the
binary checking, is missing. We're pondering a bit about what, in the end,
would be useful to have in or around the kernel.

As said above, the patch is only an MPI implementation, not RSA, and neither
the rest to make it useful, like a crypto API interface and padding.
So we can't really judge the developer's skills or crypto knowledge.
It does point out that having a hidden implementation can never foster
much trust, as no one can read the code and judge if it's good or not.

To a certain degree you're right, but the nice thing about open source is
that people who know better can spot errors, and if those are fixed, it
can happen that an "incompetent" person created something excellent. Maybe
not at first, but in the end. (I suspect that a good coder with no crypto
knowledge, but with feedback from experts, can implement something better
than one expert with mediocre coding skills.)
The code should be judged, not the people writing it. Besides, it isn't
always that hard to get something secure, if things are kept simple and
straightforward. E.g. writing a secure AES implementation isn't magic.
RSA is much more complex though. (Rather ironic, as the theory behind RSA
is simple, but the implementation hairy. With AES it's exactly the opposite.
The coder doesn't need to understand the algebra behind it, knowing that it
can be done with a simple table lookup is enough).
In general the tricky part is around the crypto implementation itself, how
it's used, key management, etc. (Though the border is vague, so maybe you
included all that when saying "crypto implementation".)

The code posted has no such errors, see above. Maybe the part that wasn't has,
who knows.

True, but the code wasn't put into the kernel for security reasons. Why it
was remains a bit of a mystery, but it looks like it was for convenience.
