Not reading LKML much, eh? Anyway, it's already being taken care of; see
<http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=115058555819917&w=2> for
well-tested patches for 2.4.33-rc1. They probably apply to 2.4.32 as well.
The powers that be have decreed that gcc-4 fixes won't be accepted
into the official 2.4 kernel, which is a pity since they are smaller
and simpler than the gcc-3.4 fixes which did get included.
