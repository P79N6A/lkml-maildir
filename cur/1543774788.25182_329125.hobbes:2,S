Hi,
I cannot boot -mm kernel on my system since 2.6.12-rc5-mm1. The system
is a partition on ES7000 and has a dual boot for SuSE/RH, which is set
up using two LVM volumes. 
le020-p2:~ # pvs
PV         VG         Fmt  Attr PSize  PFree
/dev/sda2  stash      lvm2 a-   16.50G  3.50G
/dev/sdb2  rhel4stash lvm2 a-   16.50G 16.00M
The other partition on that system set up for dual boot also, but uses 2
disks directly without LVM, and boots just fine.
Last thing I see on the console during failed boot:
...
device-mapper: 4.4.0-ioctl (2005-01-12) initialised: dm-devel@redhat.com
ReiserFS: dm-0: found reiserfs format "3.6" with standard journal
I put little debug in and it turned out that the boot hangs while
waiting on a buffer in fs/reiserfs/super.c read_bitmaps() routine, on
second iteration of the following loop:
    for (i = 0; i < SB_BMAP_NR(s); i++) {
        wait_on_buffer(SB_AP_BITMAP (s)[i].bh);  <========waiting here
indefinitely
        if (!buffer_uptodate(SB_AP_BITMAP(s)[i].bh)) {
            reiserfs_warning(s,"sh-2029: reiserfs read_bitmaps: "
                         "bitmap block (#%lu) reading failed",
                         SB_AP_BITMAP(s)[i].bh->b_blocknr);
            for (i = 0; i < SB_BMAP_NR(s); i++)
                brelse(SB_AP_BITMAP(s)[i].bh);
            vfree(SB_AP_BITMAP(s));
            SB_AP_BITMAP(s) = NULL;
            return 1;
        }
        load_bitmap_info_data (s, SB_AP_BITMAP (s) + i);
    }
Thanks,
