It's a trick question?  The config option would let you specify that no 
kernel config information at all would be stored with or in the kernel.  No 
cost, no memory footprint.  And I would get to have the extra warm n fuzzy 
usability I tend to go on at such lengths about.  So we're both happy, right? 
I'd even remain happy if the option were set *off* by default.
