I couldn't compile sunrpc as a module since it said that
module_kernel_version (or something like that) was defined in both
net/sunrpc/{sched,sysctl}.c
Something else.  It wouldn't boot on a 386.  After uncompressing, it just
froze.  This kernel was compiled on the 386 (don't ask) using tools
available in the latest utilities in debian potato.
This machine boots ok with 2.2.13
