Yes, I'm saying there are no SMP issues with the shared cred structure.  I
looked for them and failed to find any.  Credentials are not set
cross-task, and are always done via atomic ops.  I also failed to find any
broader race conditions that would require a lock.

Ahh, hmm.  That might possibly be useful, though I'm not convinced it's
necessary.  The benefit would have to outweigh the added obscurity of using
a macro, and I don't think it does.

Ahh, ok.  I see what you're getting at now.  It's an interesting idea, and
I think a good one.  But it's not really related to the patch I did, and I
don't want to tie one to the other.
