Aha. In our case, the output function is
net/bridge/br_forward.c:__dev_queue_push_xmit(). This is because 
__br_forward_finish() (same file) uses this as okfn. Remember the IP hooks 
are "faked" on the bridge hooks, so functions attached to NF_IP_POST_ROUTING 
are called when the IP packet/frame passes the NF_BR_POST_ROUTING hook. They 
are not called earlier. All of this assuming that the destination device 
according to the routing table is a (logical) bridge device. If not, the 
packets go through the IP code and netfilter hooks normally.
So, what if we were to add the following code to the start of 
__dev_queue_push_xmit():
	if (skb->protocol == __constant_htons(ETH_P_IP)) {
		struct dst_entry *dst = skb->dst;
		if (hh) {
			read_lock_bh(&hh->hh_lock);
  			memcpy(skb->data - 16, hh->hh_data, 16);
			read_unlock_bh(&hh->hh_lock);
		}
	}
hh being NULL for an unfragmented IP packet and else non-NULL? Do realize that 
I (I can't speak for Lennert ofcourse) am not very familiar to the workings 
of the IP code.
Then we can remove the memcpy from ip_fragment(). Does that make sense?
