This is not the only bug in the alpha raid code which is reproducable
well and doesnt get fixed - I tried to look into the kernel but am not
that deep into buffer_head, ll_rw_block and raid things to fix it
myself and i dont blame anyone ...
Easy setup
raid0 of raid5s ...
read:
/dev/md0 raid0 /dev/md1 /dev/md2
/dev/md1 raid5 scsi disks (tried with 6 and 3)
/dev/md2 raid5 scsi disks (tried with 6 and 3)
As soon as you initiate a "mke2fs /dev/md0" the machine
hangs with "Got md request, not good" (md.c -> do_md_request())
I reproduced this with different hardware (machines, harddrives, scsi controllers etc - Even on sparc ...)
From the manpage this is a feature which should work.
