Erk, it should default into the 'voltage scaling unavailable' mode when
this happens, but the code is missing. I'll push that out to Linus
along with a large bunch of other cpufreq changes tonight/tomorrow.
Strange how your CPU seems to claim to support voltage scaling, but
erm.. doesn't. Can you also mail me the output of x86info -a -v

Something also went horribly wrong when trying to determine your FSB.

Leading to this tradegy. I'll take a look over the longhaul code later
too, as it could use some cleanups in more than a few areas.
I've also fallen behind in adding support for the newer C3s to it.
