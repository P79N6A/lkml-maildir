Normal. You are running OOM. Look at what you do:
    while (1)
    {
         malloc(much mem)
         // do not free the mem !!!!
    }
So in a couple steps you are OOM.
I suppose what you want to do is
    buf = malloc(...)
    while (1)
        touch random page
But...you 'touch' is read-only (the printf), so the page will never
really be allocated. Try with this:
#include <stdlib.h>
// 4Gb
#define SZ 4*1024*1024*1024
main(){
    char *buf;
    buf = malloc(SZ);
    if (!buf)
    {
        perror("bad try");
        exit(1);
    }
    while(1){
        buf[random()%SZ] = 0;
    }
}
Ah, with 2Gb of ram you will need to compile with 3Gb userspace,
to let a one only process allocate a chunk of mem that does not fit
into core memory. Or, easier, run several instances...
