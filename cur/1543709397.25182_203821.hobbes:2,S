Well, when I removed the local poll_flag, using only the global one,
and cleared it to zero after the long long was fetched under the lock
(in the read routine), my observed problems go away.
static size_t poll(struct file *fp, struct poll_table_struct *wait)
{
    DEB(printk(KERN_INFO"%s : poll() called\n", devname));
    poll_wait(fp, &pwait, wait);
    DEB(printk(KERN_INFO"%s : poll() returned\n", devname));
    return global_poll_flag;
}
static int read(struct file *fp, char *buf, size_t count, loff_t *ppos)
{
    long long tmp;
    size_t flags;
    spin_lock_irqsave(&rtc_lock, flags);
    tmp = rtc_tick;
    global_poll_flag = 0;
    spin_unlock_irqrestore(&rtc_lock, flags);
    if(copy_to_user(buf, &tmp, sizeof(tmp)))
        return -EFAULT;
    return sizeof(tmp);
}
