No, we don't schedule with the atomic kmap held.  What I meant was:
	get_user(page);		/* fault it in */
	kmap_atomic(page);
	if (copy_from_user(page))
		goto slow_path;
	kunmap_atomic(page);
	...
slow_path:
	kunmap_atomic(page);
	kmap(page);
	copy_from_user(page);
	kunmap(page);
slow_path is only taken if the vm (or truncate in the case of read())
unmapped the page in that little window after the get_user().
