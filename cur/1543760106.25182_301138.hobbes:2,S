I have a dvd+-rw drive (LITE-ON DVDRW LDW-411S with FS0K firmware).  The
drive appears to opperate correctly.  I can mount media, read from it,
and burn just fine, but printk output indicates some error.
2.6.10:
hdc: packet command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdc: packet command error: error=0x54
ide: failed opcode was 100
2.6.11:
hdc: packet command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdc: packet command error: error=0x54 { AbortedCommand
LastFailedSense=0x05 }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
These messages do not appear if media is not in the tray.  If media is
in the tray, these messages will repeat continuously (at a rate of about
2 per second).  The media doesn't need to be mounted, just present.
Additionally, this did not occur when this drive was in an i686 box, but
it does occur now that it is in an x86_64 box.
Has anyone seen a problem like this or have any suggestions?
Thanks,
Jeremy
