 I think that is a pretty good assumption.
 It won't be me how loads two different firmwares concurrently to the
 same device :)

 For this matter, I could add a readonly 'name' which gives you the same
 string as $FIRMWARE. That way if something goes wrong you can easily
 find out which firmware image the kernel is expecting.

 This will get caught, because sysfs won't allow two entries with the
 same name.
