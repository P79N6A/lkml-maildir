We are interested in seeing the results, especially if the tests are based
on the draft19, which ought to be published soon based on the discussions
in the mobile-ip mailing list.

We are using standard routing in HA to route packets intercepted by HA to
MN through a tunnel device.  However, HA needs to also act as a neighbor
discovery proxy for MN and not tunnel any ND packets destined to MN, but
reply to them on the bahalf of MN. We use the netfilter hook to check for
ND packets with global addresses that would be otherwise tunneled and feed
them directly to the local processing code.
Thanks,
