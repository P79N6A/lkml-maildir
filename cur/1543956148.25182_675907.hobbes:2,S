First, I totally agree with Serge's comment (oh well, it's about my
own suggestion, so I must) - for checkpoint/restart we'll need more
states if we are to use the same subsystem.
Second, my gut feeling is that a single, atomic operation to get the
status is preferred over multiple (non-atomic) operations. In other
words, I suggest a single state file instead of two. You can encode
every possible transition in a single state. It's not that the kernel
doesn't know what's going on inside, so it can just as well report it
directly. I don't see the benefit of using two files.
