Well, as I've said, don't expect folk to change their style just
because something has been decided privately amongst a small select
group of folk (which is exactly what seems to have happened - maybe
not intentionally.)
And don't expect subsystem maintainers to accept the new "style"
guidelines without a fight.
However, if we really are concerned about type-unsafe allocation,
we should be using something like Alan's suggestion, where the
return type from the *alloc function is appropriately typed and
not void *.
