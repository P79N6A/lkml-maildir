Google knows of one and it doesn't actually explain how to use kevents.

struct sigevent sigev = {
	.sigev_notify = SIGEV_KEVENT,
	.sigev_kevent_fd = kev_fd,
	.sigev_value.sival_ptr = &MyCookie
};
struct itimerspec its = {
	.it_value = { ... },
	.it_interval = { ... }
};
struct timespec timeout = { .. };
struct ukevent events[max];
timer_t timer;
timer_create(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &sigev, &timer);
timer_settime(timer, 0, &its, NULL);
/* ... */
kevent_get_events(kev_fd, min, max, &timeout, events, 0);
Which isn't all that different from what Ulrich Drepper suggested and
Solaris does right now. (timer_create would probably end up calling
kevent_ctl itself, but it obviously can't do that unless kevents
actually support real interval timers).
