It's not really just about editing the password file though, is it?  
After all, if I have write access to all of root's other files, I can just
make a cron job that dumps in an extra user to /etc/passwd, or any number
of other possibilities... adding a capability for filesystem access to
root's files would likely be more useful than just CAP_EDIT_PASSWD.
