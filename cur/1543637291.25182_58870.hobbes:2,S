Andrew,
I tried the change to ptrace.c, but it did not work.  I cannot boot the
machine.  It gives an oops upon boot.

Take the lock from interrupt context and it'll deadlock.

Yes, I'm adding the same check to 2.5.  It's anon pages as well
as pagecache pages.  And unless we have a
             BUG_ON(PageLRU(page) && in_interrupt())
in put_page_testzero() then I'm not sure how we can be sure that
aio is the only problem area.

Not sure what you mean by this?

Sure.  If the lock is heavily used, performance critical and you've
done the work to ensure that maximum hold time is small, it is
well worth doing.  Plus we need it for free-from-interrupt-context,
and we may need it for performing LRU list motion within IO completion,
although that's looking a bit remote at present.
