This is true for text files, where a human reader can interpret the data
correctly even in absence of a declaration. For programming languages,
this is typically not the case. Instead, in order to correctly interpret
the source code, you need to declare the encoding. For a script, this
should be done inside the file itself, as there is no explicit
invocation of a compiler or some such where the script encoding could
be specified externally.
