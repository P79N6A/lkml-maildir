Hello.
I tried ckrm (Class-based Kernel Resource Management) patch. 
I am very interested in ckrm. 
However, I found the following problems. 
1) Both of ckcpu and ckmem could not be applied at the same time. 
 I corrected the patch by hand. 
 Is it impossible to use both at the same time?
2) When rbcemod of the module is compiled, "ckrm_cpu_change_class" 
   becomes an undeclared symbol. 
 I modified kernel source kernel/class.c and export "ckrm_cpu_change_class": 
        EXPORT_SYMBOL(ckrm_cpu_change_class);
3) The bash process newly executed dies one after another when rbadmin 
   is executed.
 The value of the argument "cls" of the "ckrm_cpu_change_class" 
 function might be NULL. 
 Therefore, the NULL pointer dereference occurs when it 
 starts changing the class of the bash process. 
best regards,
NIWA
