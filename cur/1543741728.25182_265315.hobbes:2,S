Yes. Clock modulation is not as useful compared to enhanced speedstep.
But, 
I feel, it should be OK to have the driver, though it is not really
useful 
in common case. It may be useful in some exceptional cases. 
The particular case where someone wanted to use p4-clockmod was: they
wanted to run the CPU as slow as possible. Enhanced speedstep allows few
(2-3) possible freqs on this CPU. But, p4-clockmod allows as low as
12.5% 
actual freq.
So, I think, it is good to have this module for the users who really
want 
to use it. But I don't think any userspace or kernel governor should use
this driver by default, without user knowledge. That can cause extensive
delays and slow response times.
Thanks,
Venki
