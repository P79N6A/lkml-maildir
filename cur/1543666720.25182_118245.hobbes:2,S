Hallo l-k,
I have problems with 3ware Escalade 7500-8 controller under 2.4.20
kernel. Time to time I've found some processes in 'D' state and I've
found in the dmesg this messages:
3w-xxxx: scsi0: Unit #0: Command (f7a68c00) timed out, resetting card.
3w-xxxx: scsi0: Unit #0: Command (f7a64a00) timed out, resetting card.
3w-xxxx: scsi0: Unit #0: Command (f7a71a00) timed out, resetting card.
3w-xxxx: scsi0: Unit #0: Command (f7a65200) timed out, resetting card.
3w-xxxx: scsi0: Unit #0: Command (f7a63200) timed out, resetting card.
3w-xxxx: scsi0: Unit #0: Command (f7a67a00) timed out, resetting card.
3w-xxxx: scsi0: Unit #0: Command (f7a6ea00) timed out, resetting card.
3w-xxxx: scsi0: Unit #0: Command (f7a7a400) timed out, resetting card.
3w-xxxx: scsi0: Unit #0: Command (f7a6be00) timed out, resetting card.
3w-xxxx: scsi0: Unit #0: Command (f7a65400) timed out, resetting card.
Please, can anyone advice me, what happends? It's problem in the 3ware
board, have I use newer firmware on it... ? Can I do somethink with this
behavior?

/proc/scsi/3w-xxxx# cat 0
