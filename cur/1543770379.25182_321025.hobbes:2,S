Subject: [RFC] Introducing a new sub-architecture
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I'm about to submit a new sub-architecture under arch/cris and I would
like to get your input on how this is best done. I can see at least
3 alternatives:
1. All the patches goes to LKML. Lots of boring patches that most 
people doesn't care about.
2. Send drivers to the driver subsystems maintainers for review 
and then a big .tgz to Andrew.
3. Send the .tgz directly to Andrew without reviews from the
driver guys.
I leaning towards option 2, comments?
Except from the new sub-architecture there will also be patches
to the generic cris parts to add support for e.g. SMP and to
convert to the new IRQ framework.
Thanks!
