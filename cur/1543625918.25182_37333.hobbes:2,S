When you get past the BIOS problems it works a treat. Just don't believe
the manual or trust the BIOS. Set the BIOS to MP 1.1 not MP 1.4 too,
and don't put a 33Mhz card in a 66MHz slot unless you have the clock
jumpers set to software not fixed (ie how the manual doesnt recommend)
Once you deal with those bios/doc problems its a really nice board. You
want 2.4.19pre3-ac or 2.4.19pre4 for IDE performance.

Two older XP cpus normally just work (but remember its not tested cpus then)
The new ones require you modify the athlon mounting to bridge a laser cut
