Connection tracking always defrags as needed. masquerading/NAT/iptables 
with connection tracking uses that.
This means that if any of these are enabled and your machine acts as a 
router lots of CPU could get burned in defragmentation, and packets
will not forwarded until all fragments arrived.
All very nasty, but unfortunately there is no alternative.
