Nope, it works just fine because REQ_DRIVE_TASK used only
no-data protocol, please check task_no_data_intr().

This would miss whole point of not _reading_ these registers (IO is slow).
IMHO new flags denoting {in,out} registers should be added (to <linux/ata.h>
to share them with libata) so new code can be sane and old flags would map
on new flags when needed.
