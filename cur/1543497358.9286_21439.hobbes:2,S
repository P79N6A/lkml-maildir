It seems the proper operation of KSH depends upon the
PWD environment variable.  Normally, KSH is intelligent
enough to figure out its current directory without the
environment variable "hint".  Once that value is set,
everything behaves normally.  By adding:
	PWD=`pwd`
	export PWD
to /etc/profile, I can now use ksh for my shell.
Grrr.  ;-)
