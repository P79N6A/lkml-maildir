I believe we all have the same problem. The only solution I found for
this was to proceed like David described. I know even have a 'git-patches'
directory next to my git repo to keep the resulting patches after I do a
'git-format-patch --mbox'.
When Linus called it the 'stupid content tracker', he was half right.
In fact, it's more a 'changes tracker' than a 'content tracker'. It
logs everything you and others do, so if you don't want your operations
to appear on others' history, you have to hide them by working on
temporary trees to generate the patches you will use later.
At first I found this very annoying, but finally, it's a way to ensure
that I always have clean and ordered patches. It's not much different
from what I was doing by hand previously, it's just that all git-xxx
operations take much longer time, possibly because of the compression.
On the other hand, its ability to understand mbox saves me some time.

What sometimes worries me is that some operations seem so much complicated
that there is a high risk of doing the wrong thing, and I'm not certain
that this will reduce the number of mistakes I do in a month, compared
to manual patching. I became a real addict to 'git-reset --hard' ...
