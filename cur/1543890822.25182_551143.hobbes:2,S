No. The application is _correct_. It's how file descriptors are defined to 
work.

Totally different. That's an application internal issue. It does *not* 
mean that we can break existing standards.

Wrong. I already gave an example of real code that just didn't bother to 
keep track of which fd's it had open, and closed them all. Partly, in 
fact, because you can't even _know_ which fd's you have open when somebody 
else just execve's you.
You can call it buggy, but the fact is, if you do, you're SIMPLY WRONG. 
You cannot just change years and years of coding practice, and standard 
documentations. The behaviour of file descriptors is a fact. Ignoring that 
fact because you don't like it is naïve and simply not realistic.
