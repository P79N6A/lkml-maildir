	Andrea, what's the point of making blkdev_get() bump ->bd_count
in case of success and blkdev_put() - drop it?  We _do_ grab a reference
before calling blkdev_get() - any place where we don't is an immediately
oopsable hole both in the old an in the new tree.  Notice that you
do down(&bdev->bd_sem) before that increment of refcount, so if caller
doesn't hold a reference we are toast.  What's going on there?
