Certainly a big chunk of OpenAFS might not be, just like a big chunk
of other non-GPL drivers for Linux.
But what about the glue code?  Can that be defended as not a derived
work, such that it doesn't have to be GPL?
If not, can the whole containing both the non-derivative work and the
source code providing the glue without which the whole wouldn't
fulfill its intended purpose be regarded as a mere aggregate, and thus
not be subject to the requirement that the whole be released under the
GPL?
