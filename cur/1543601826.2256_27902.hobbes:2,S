   Jens, what's your feeling about the stability of these things, especially
   wrt weird drivers?
   Ie do you think this is really a 2.4.x thing, or early 2.5.x?
On my side of this work I feel that the 64-bit PCI dma infrastructure
by itself is a safe merge in 2.4.11 or something like that.
Later,
