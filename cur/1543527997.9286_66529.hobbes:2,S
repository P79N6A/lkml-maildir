Due to demand. I have started the linux console project. The goal is to
design a new multihead console system for linux. I hope to have it ready
to be ported right into the 2.5.X kernels. I see alot of people have
worked on new and different ideas for a console system. I would like to
see this project be the center where people can display their ideas and
code. In the hope is to merge everyones efforts and develope a lean and
yet powerful multihead console system. 
The web site is 
http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=3063
I also have a 
http://linuxconsole.sourceforge.net
 domain but haven't yet
linked the two pages together. What I need is someone to work on the web
pages. I also need developers of course. 
Their is a mailing list already. Just go to
http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=3063
 and select the mailing list
section. From tehri you can subscribe via the web. Have fun :)
