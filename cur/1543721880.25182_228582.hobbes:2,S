Please don't do that -- it makes printing UTF-8 impossible. While I'd
not argue that now is the time to start outputting UTF-8 all over the
place, I wouldn't accept that it's a good time to _prevent_ it either,
as your patch would do.
If you want to post-process printk output, don't do it in the kernel. 
I'd suggest that in this instance you should be fixing the ACPI code
instead, so it doesn't print the characters to which you object.
