Hi,
Here are some i2c driver changes for 2.5.67, again.  These include a
number of compile fixes, and a build fix due to my previous patches.
Also a patch to help out the i2c based video drivers is in here, and two
new i2c drivers have been added.
Please pull from:  bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/i2c-2.5
thanks,
greg k-h
