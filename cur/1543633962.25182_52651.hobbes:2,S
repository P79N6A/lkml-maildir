Are you looking at BK, the 2.5.21 tree I'm looking at still has:
#define PARANOIA(x...) printk(KERN_NOTICE __FUNCTION__ ": " x)
I assume you are using gcc 3.x? (which one?)
I don't get any warnings/errors on 2.96.
I think having two macros for exactly the same thing is ugly. A better
solution might be to borrow some code from arch/ia64/kernel/unaligned.c
#define PARANOIA(f...) \
	do { printk(KERN_NOTICE "%s: ", __FUNCTION__); printk(f); } while(0)
(untested, and I think this will print an extra "<4>" ?)
Unless someone has a better idea. In any case, the other printk macros in
smb_debug.h needs treatment too and not just the PARANOIA macro.
If you are cleaning things up I think that the following also sometimes
use debug macros with a single string, but with a 'macro(a, b...)' syntax:
drivers/net/pci-skeleton.c
drivers/char/i810_rng.c
sound/oss/via82cxxx_audio.c
	DPRINTK
drivers/hotplug/pci_hotplug_{core,util}.c
	dbg/err/info/warn
drivers/char/machzwd.c
	dprnintk
drivers/ieee1394/sbp2.c
	SBP2_ORB_DEBUG
net/ipv4/netfilter/ipt_ULOG.c
net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_conntrack_irc.c
	DEBUGP
sound/oss/vwsnd.c
	DBGP
fs/ntfs/debug.h
	ntfs_warning/ntfs_error
Many of them are not enabled by default, and maybe they have already been
taken care of.
And maybe run suggested changes by the respective maintainers first.
Thanks.
