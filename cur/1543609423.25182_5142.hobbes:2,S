Hi,
I finally got around to writing about how I spent my summer vacation.
Well, wasn't really a vacation (4 monthes unpaid time-off from HP) 
and I did (too) many other things as well. But I did hack on OB600
PCMCIA support and ultimately didn't get it working.  I ran out of
time.  It's frustrating I can't use my ob600 as a route/firewall/
dhcp/nat server.  But I know *alot* more about PCMCIA than I did before
and that was really the goal.
If anyone has docs for the VL82C717 chip or win95 OB600SS.VXD source code,
I'm pretty sure I can make it work. With a PCMCIA bus analyzer, I might
try again...I have a 16500B with 16550 and 16510 add-on cards if
someone wants to loan me a PCMCIA pod.
In case anyone wants to hack on it further, source and notes
are on:
