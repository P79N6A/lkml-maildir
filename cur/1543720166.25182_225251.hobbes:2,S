In *any* setup, kernelspace or userspace, it's typically possible
to find some silly way to break boot sequence. Unplugging
keyboard and removing (unneded for server) videocard are my
favorites ;)

I stayed away from it too, but I always knew I'll need it sooner
or later.

My init scripts are (trying to) recover from any failure.
They ignore non-fatal error conditions.
I'll fix your fsck example like this: make script check
FSCK_ACTION env var for N (never do fsck), ASK (ask user
if serious trouble), and AUTO (fix automagically without
user). Set FSCK_ACTION as needed per box via kernel command line.
Fixing/tailoring init written in C is harder (more time-consuming).
Fixing/tailoring kernel bootstrap sequence is harder still.
As an example, NFS boot. How can you force your ethernet into,
say, 100 Mbit FDX _before_ kernel do DHCP thing via ip= kernel
parameter?
That's one of reasons why moving to userspace might be a good idea.

I just did that yesterday when I needed to make USB keyboard to
work on my box, first time ever for me. I let it boot, ssh'ed in,
and built new kernel. I could modify my initrd too, but that wasn't
needed.

Bootstrapping problem exist no matter how you are bootstrapping.
When something is broken, difficulty of repairs cannot be estimated
that simple. I don't think "you are using intird -> fixing will be hard"
always holds true.
BTW, in my case, booting my box was not just hard, it was impossible.
It had broken PS2 ports. I needed to "only" enter BIOS setup and tell
it to ignore keyboard errors on boot, but I couldn't enter it
without keyboard! But I digress...
