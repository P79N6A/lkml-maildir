I did not know, but thats good news! My research was only based on the LKM module howto.

I totally agree! (But I was preparing for the discussion were people
argue that they need a different set of parameters at boot time.)
One question remains though, how do you handle the initialization of
multiple instances of an inbound driver?
mcd0.io=0x340 mcd1.io=0x350 
Thnx,
