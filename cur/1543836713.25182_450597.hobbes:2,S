reiser4 tries to reduce number of tree lookups. better, if there would 
be one tree lookup for one readpages call.
what we are currently doing in a not-yet-submitted patch (below), i 
don't see how it can be done by mpage_readpages.

what it does do yet -- it doesn't use one bio for more than one page.
BTW, read_cache_page() and mpage_readpages are similar, I guess the 
second can be rewritten using the first one, no?
