Subject: [ANNOUNCE] udev 018 release
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I've released the 018 version of udev.  It can be found at:
 	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-018.tar.gz
rpms built against Red Hat FC2-test1 are available at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-018-1.i386.rpm
with the source rpm at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-018-1.src.rpm
udev allows users to have a dynamic /dev and provides the ability to
have persistent device names.  It uses sysfs and /sbin/hotplug and runs
entirely in userspace.  It requires a 2.6 kernel with CONFIG_HOTPLUG
enabled to run.  Please see the udev FAQ for any questions about it:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-FAQ
For any udev vs devfs questions anyone might have, please see:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev_vs_devfs
Major changes from the 017 version:
	- We now handle the ability to generate all partitions for a
	  device to allow removable devices to work in a sane manner.
	  This has been requested by a lot of people.
	- there's a new %s{} modifier available for people to use
	- the SYSFS_ style rule has changed to SYSFS{}.  The old style
	  is still supported for now, but you have been warned
	- %c1 style modifiers has been changed to %c{1}.  Again, the old
	  style format still works.
	- scsi_id is built by default now in the rpm and is available in
	  the pre-built rpm package.  This should get it a wider range
	  of testing.
	- lots of bug fixes and other cleanups.
In all, there is nothing hugely major in this release, but any current
users of udev will want this version for all of the bugfixes if for
nothing else.
Thanks to everyone who has send me patches for this release, a full list
of everyone, and their changes is below.
udev development is done in a BitKeeper repository located at:
	bk://linuxusb.bkbits.net/udev
Daily snapshots of udev from the BitKeeper tree can be found at:

If anyone ever wants a tarball of the current bk tree, just email me.
thanks,
