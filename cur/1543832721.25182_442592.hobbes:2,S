Hi,
If you have received a motherboard or card with a broken EEPROM then your card 
is in a limbo state - it might work but results are unreliable and may cause 
your entire system to break (and even data corruption).
You should contact the hardware vendor and have the board replaced or upgraded 
with a proper EEPROM. Continuing to work with the corrupted EEPROM image that 
you have now can seriously hurt you later on.
Cheers,
Auke
