Subject: Why video region busy?

Older S3 cards use region 0xA0000 - 0xAFFFF for their MMIO region.
I would like to grab this region using request_mem_region, but it is
universally marked busy for all x86 kernels.  :(  
My code currently avoids resource management and just directly writes to
0xA0000 -- not a good solution.
What is the best solution for this?  IMHO the region should not be
marked busy in the arch code.  But if noone will change that, my code
should perhaps stick its hands into the resource record and unset the
BUSY flag?
Thanks,
	Jeff
