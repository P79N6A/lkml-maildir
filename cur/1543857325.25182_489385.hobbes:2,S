This would be possible with rfkill and the ideas from Dmitry.
The vendors that have a button that directly toggle the radio, should
create an input device themselves and just send the KEY_RFKILL event when toggled.
All other types should use rfkill for the toggling handling, that way HAL only needs to
listen to KEY_RFKILL coming from the input devices that are associated to the keys.
