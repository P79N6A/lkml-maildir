Moreover, it obviously leaks references to struct gendisk _and_ changes
semantics of RAW_SETBIND in incompatible way.
Consider that vetoed.  And yes, get_gendisk() issue alone would be enough.
Greg, please, RTFS to see at which point do we decide which driver will
be used by raw device.  It's _not_ RAW_SETBIND, it's open().  So where
your symlink should point is undecided until the same point.
