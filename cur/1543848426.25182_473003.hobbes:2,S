Well, we have two different things here.
One is short term block. For example, PM transitions, or BIST. In that
case, I reckon it might be worth just making the user space PCI config
space accessors block in the kernel during the transition (a wait
queue ?)
One is long term block: the device is off. That's where it becomes
tricky. For D3, I suppose it's actually correct to return cached infos
provided that those do actually cache the PM capability indicating D3
state (that is we need to update the cache after the transition). And
it's correct to prevent writes too I suppose.
Then there are problems with things like embedded or some Apple ASICs
where we toggle power/clock lines of devices but not directly using PCI
PM (in fact, those devices might not even have PCI PM capability
exposed). Returning cached info is fine, but we can't tell userland
about the powered off (or unclocked) state of the device that way.
Ben.
