I encounter a similar issue, when swsusp_swap_check failed.
It seems the swsusp_free isn't required in the failure case,
suspend_prepare_image has correctly handled the failure case to me.
Other arch? I wonder why swsusp_free is called after device_power_down
failed as well. No pages are allocated before device_power_down.
