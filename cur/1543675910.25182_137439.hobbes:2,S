Yeah i get the same with 2.5.70 on a 32way NUMAQ, basically we just keep 
going regardless of what NR_IRQS is and then try and write garbage all 
over the IDT. There appears to be something wrong with my patch as it gets 
ignored each time i send it.

Are you implying that the large array stopped your box from booting?

Hmm dynamic irq_vectors sounds good, we could start off with a static 
amount and then dynamically allocate once we start reaching the silly 
numbers. Dynamic allocation for all might get interesting at early boot.
This is the patch i use right now to boot 2.5.70 on 32way NUMAQ without 
disabling IOAPICs, however i do drop the overflow interrupts.

I also have another patch to just increase NR_IRQS, this was used on the 
same 8quad and allowed full functionality of all the devices upto and 
including node7

http://www.osdl.org/projects/numaqhwspprt/results/data/dmesg-32way-8quad-2.5.70-640irqs
But the static arrays aren't all that nice, do you plan on starting on the 
dynamic allocation of NR_IRQS sized arrays sometime soon?
Thanks,
