Hum, I also tried it some days ago and it didn't work for me, so I
read LDD3 and I found such explanation about such limitation of
remap_pfn_range(). I heard then that changed in 2.6.15 because of the
new flag; so I have had the same situation.
If it is possible to remap a kernel buffer to userspace with
remap_pfn_range, how should be done the right way?
