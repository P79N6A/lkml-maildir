Well, take note of what James wrote. We do guarantee that there will be 
no further user-initiated disk activity after generic_scsi_suspend. (For 
the disk but not the rest of the bus.) This doesn't apply to 
ioctl's/special requests but as James has rightly pointed out this is 
probably not an issue for realistic intents and purposes. It may 
actually be an advantage.
