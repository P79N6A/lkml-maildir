Well, we seem to have an increasing number of silly limitations in
MMC host implementations.  In this particular case, I guess the
easiest solution would be to supply a capability flag from the host
to say "only supports power of two block sizes" - and disable
password support if this flag is set.
Yes, this means that password-locked cards become non-functional
with such restricted hosts, but I think that's realistically
unavoidable.
