Well, if you have just one common bootloader on ppc, no problem, go
ahead at load it from bootloader. You'll not have to worry about page
tables etc. I could not do that on i386 because there are many
bootloaders in use here.
You are going to have completely different resume phase, through. [And
if someone wants suspend-to-disk on ppc, *now*, it might still be
easiest to write those two screens of assembly to port swsusp to ppc.]
