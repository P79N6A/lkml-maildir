Boring administrivial note: all these patches effectively had the same
title.  Because the text in "[]" is considered to be something which should
be discarded when the patch is applied.
This convention is useful because things like sequence numbering, kernel
version information, etc are only relevant when you sent the patch and are
not relevant when the patches hit the git tree.
Bottom line: please do include the subsystem ideitification as you have
tried to do, but please do not place it inside "[]".
As described in the very fine
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/tpp.txt,
 better
Subject:s here would have been
Subject: [PATCH 2/5] GFS2: Cleanup explicit check for mandatory locks
Subject: [PATCH 3/5] 9PFS: Cleanup explicit check for mandatory locks
Subject: [PATCH 4/5] AFS: Cleanup explicit check for mandatory locks
Subject: [PATCH 5/5] NFS: Cleanup explicit check for mandatory locks
Extreme trivia: I don't consider a colon to terminate a sentence, so if I
can be bothered I'll convert "Cleanup" there to "cleanup".  And I don't
consider "cleanup" to be a word, so it becomes "clean up".  And I'll
usually remvoe the final "." from the end of the subject because it's
basically just a waste of space.
