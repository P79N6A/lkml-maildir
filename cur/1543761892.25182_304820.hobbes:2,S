i have not been able to reproduce it with the aforementioned NFS patches 
removed.  i'm now convinced it was a bug in one of the NFS patches i had 
applied, even though none of them come near the fraglist stuff, but i 
haven't had a chance to nail it down.
i had implemented a patch to cause the RPC client to reuse the port 
number when reconnecting to the server after the server drops the 
connection... this is a standard practice for other RPC implementations. 
  i suspect it was that patch that was causing the trouble.
thanks for the follow-up!
