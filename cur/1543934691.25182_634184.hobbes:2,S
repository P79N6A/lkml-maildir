Subject: [PATCH 4/5] CONNECTOR: cleanup struct cn_callback_entry
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/4/16

- 'cb' is a fake struct member. In a previous patch struct cn_callback
was renamed to cn_callback_id, so 'cb' should have been deleted at that
time.
- 'nls' isn't used and is redundant, we can retrieve this data through
cn_callback_entry.pdev->nls.
- 'seq' and 'group' should be u32, as they are declared to be u32 in
other places.
