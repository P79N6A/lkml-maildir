The more work may turn out being too much for you (although it is nothing
exactly tricky that would introduce subtle bugs, it is a fair amont of churn).
However, in that case we can still merge these two:
mm-fix-fault-vs-invalidate-race-for-linear-mappings.patch
mm-fix-clear_page_dirty_for_io-vs-fault-race.patch
Which fix real bugs that need fixing (and will at least help to get some of
my patches off your hands).
