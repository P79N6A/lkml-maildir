Here's my two cents.
1. Add time-consuming get_plt_size() functionality to
scripts/mod/modpost.c (per arch), and calculate the size when
scripts/mod/modpost is called to generate mymodule.mod.c during
making of kernel module.
2. How to pass this info down to sys_init_module() in kernel? Maybe
we can add a special section in mymodule.mod.c. So this info will be
part of mymodule.ko and parsed by sys_init_module() later.
Then it won't make too much impact on the build process.
Sounds easy;-) Hopefully it'll work.
