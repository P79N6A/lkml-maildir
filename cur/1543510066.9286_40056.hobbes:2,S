Ok, done.
By the way, I have completely disabled the "KeepAlive" feature of Apache
(KeepAlive Off), and the problem has not came back for the moment (15
minutes ...) may be it's a bit early to draw conclusions but a least it
seems to help (at this time 1200 open connections, 110 in SYN_RECV and
1000 in TIME_WAIT).
Kernel bug or Apache bug ?
Thanks.
