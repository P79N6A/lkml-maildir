As a follow up to my own post,  I built a kernel without UDF support to 
test my theory and found that the boot failed with the same error,
"unknown block".  So now I am in the process of building a new kernel 
after starting from my old config.gz from /proc.   At least I know that UDF
support had nothing to do with the problem.
