Yes.
OK. Now it looks that I am reproducing something.
Running curl-loader with 60K.conf (edit the name of interface) configuration:
#ulimit -n 80000
#curl-loader -f ./conf-examples/60K.conf -w
 it adds successfully 60 000 secondary IPv4 addresses as seen by
#ip addr | wc -l
When I tryed adding IPv6 addresses, using ipv6.conf with addresses
range edited:
IP_ADDR_MIN=  2001:db8:fff5:1::1
IP_ADDR_MAX= 2001:db8:fff5:ffff::1
I am getting after initial successes some errors:
"rtnl_talk(): RTNETLINK answers: Cannot allocate memory"
and
#ip addr | wc-l is 8194.
8K addresses added and no more? It might be a memory issue. Y can dig
into the code and look into the allocation process and limits on the
kernel memory for IPv6.
The physical memory on my computer is 480 MB.
kernel is vanilla 2.6.20.7.
Try to see, what happens, when you increase the memory on your comp,
if an option.
