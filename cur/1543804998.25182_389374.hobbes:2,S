You missed the point.  The kernel in OS X maintains creation and use of 
these files automatically.  The point wasn't oh wow multiple files' it was 
that it creates them on the fly.  I just posted back with the apparent new 
method that's being used.  I'm not sure if the 512MB number continues or if 
the next file will be 1Gb or another 512M.  Or of memory size affects it or 
not.
I'm sure developer.apple.com or apple darwin pages have the information 
somewhere.
