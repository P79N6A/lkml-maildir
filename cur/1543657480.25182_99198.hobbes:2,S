I found that if you force people to use indent, by hooking it into the 
CVS commit script, they end up writing the code so that it looks exactly 
right and indent ends up doing nothing.  Somehow people also manage to 
learn what not to do, so that indent doesn't screw up!
The trouble with indent is that many combinations of switches causes it 
to screw up royally.  The documentation is also bad and outright wrong 
in some cases.  Once you managed to find a workable set of switches, it 
is mostly OK.  The few glitches are nothing to worry about, but to find 
the sweet spot can be tiresome.  However, once you got a proper config 
file that works for you, all your troubles are over, so it is worth 
while experimenting with it a bit.
