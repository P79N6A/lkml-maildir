Just to let you know, this problem isn't just happening to you.
I compiled 2.4.19 using the same config file I used for 2.4.18 (yes, I
also turned on CONFIG_USB_HIDINPUT).  Needless to say, the mouse didn't
work on reboot.  I saw your post and compiled everything into the
kernel, and everything worked great on reboot.  So, I think this is
probably a real 2.4.19 problem.  Not something specific to you.
