One of Linux's main problems is that all daemons that drive kernel core
functionality are cluttered over various separate projects. While this
allows for independent development, it's annoying if you need to hunt
down the various daemons (udev, autofs, hotplug, iproute, to name the
first that come to mind) only to find out the new version doesn't suit
your distro. I'd rather wish there was a standard kernel "daemons"
package.

Why should other projects that recycle kernel code impact how the kernel
itself is made.
