Wrong..
From linux/Documentation/filesystems/smbfs.txt :
Mount-Time Options
Windows 95 has several bugs that affect SMB operations, and smbfs includes
work-arounds for all of the bugs found (so far, at least.) These can be
enabled at compile-time with the CONFIG_SMB_WIN95 kernel option.
Unfortunately, some of the Win 95 work-arounds interact with Win NT bugs,
so if you're using several different types of servers on your network you
probably want to enable the work-arounds at mount time. To do this, answer
`N' to the CONFIG_SMB_WIN95 option, and add the needed options listed below
to the file mode argument of the mount command for the Win 95 servers.
Option                  Value  Effect
Identify Win 95 Server    1    Enables bug fixes
Use Core Attributes       2    Speeds up directory scans, only mtime
Use Dir Attributes        4    Alternate way to get file attributes
To apply the options, sum the values and prepend it to the file mode. For
example, to use options 1 and 2 with file mode 755, you would specify 3755:
    mount /mnt/tmp -f 3755
Smbfs will print a message at mount time confirming the selected options.
Note that _only_ Windows 95 servers require special treatment; using the
"core attributes" option with Win NT will give trash timestamp values.
To summarize, if your network includes both Win 95 and NT servers:
(1) Do _not_ enable the CONFIG_SMB_WIN95 kernel option
(2) Add the desired work-around options to the mount command for your
    Win 95 server(s).
