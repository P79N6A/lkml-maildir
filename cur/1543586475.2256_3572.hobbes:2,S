Yes, I like this.  I do this manually, it allows reproducability, and
incremental
modifications, tracing how that kernel on that problem system was made...
I think the ultimate would be to put all of .config (gzipped?) in a new ELF
section without the Loadable attribute...  I wish System.map was the same.
The you're guaranteed you know how a kernel on disk was configured.
To correlate a running kernel to one on disk (vmlinuz) you have LILO...
it appends an environment variable to the kernel command line with
the name of the file it booted.  This is not infallable, since LILO maps
disk sectors, only using the filesystem at map install time.
Permaps an md5sum of the .text ELF section would conclusively
link the in-core kernel with an on-disk vmlinuz?  Shouldn't be hard
to do with objcopy and /proc/kmem?

Well it's a step...
