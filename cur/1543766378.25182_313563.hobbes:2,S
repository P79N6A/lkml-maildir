An expression such as the above which mixes signed and unsigned types will
promote the signed types to unsigned.  So there is no bug in the above
`for' statement.
But there's a bug a bit further on:

This will oops the kernel if there are more than 2^31 pollfd's at *fdpage.
Yes, like most signed variables in the kernel, `i' should really be
unsigned, but I don't think it's worth raising a patch to change it.
