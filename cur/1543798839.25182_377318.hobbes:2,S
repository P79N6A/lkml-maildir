Preemption, yes. Interrupts no.

An interrupt can never change the value without changing it back, except 
for the old-fashioned use of "up()" as a completion (which I don't think 
we do any more - we used to do it for IO completion a looong time ago).
So I think the interrupt disable could be removed for UP, at least for
non-preemption.
(Of course, maybe it's not worth it. It might not be a big performance 
issue).
