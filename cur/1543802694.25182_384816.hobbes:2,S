Hi,
  Having read the excellent paper by IBM presented at the 2003 OLS about Asynchronous I/O Support
in Linux 2.5, I found the conclusion rather disappointing:
"In conclusion, there appears to be no conditions for raw or O_DIRECT access under which AIO can
show a noticable benefit." - p385.

Is this still the case?
If I want a transactional engine (like a database) that needs to persist to stable storage, is it
still best to use a helper thread to do write/fsync or O_SYNC|O_DIRECT?
-Kenny
