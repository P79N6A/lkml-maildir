Maybe it was a bug then. Hard to say without backtraces ;)

Kernel doesn't know that you want to use it for suspend but not
regular swapping, unfortunately.

If you can work out where things are spinning/sleeping when that happens,
along with sysrq+M data, then it could make for a useful bug report. Not
entirely helpful, but if it is a reproducible problem for you, then you
might be able to get that data from outside X.
