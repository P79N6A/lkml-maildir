Ah, I see... no, it's currently:
   rmmod
      loses race
      waits for module count to hit zero
This can be desirable behavior (rmmod -f).  It's not good if you wanted
auto-module-unloading, but then, we've never wanted to take the hit to have
a pagable kernel, and I don't think we should do so.
Cheers,
Rusty.
