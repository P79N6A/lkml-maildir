Like everybody else, I wanted to chime in about my happiness with the
IDE patch (I'm using it via the 2.4.18-pre3-mjc patch collection). Works
beautifully on my laptop with an IBM Travelstar (DJSA-220) and an
IDE-interface IBM microdrive (via a compactflash adapter).
But I also wanted to REALLY thank Andre and friends for the new TASKFILE
ioctl. I'm doing a lot of low-level performance testing on the
Microdrive and the old ioctl interface was completely inadequate. For
instance, several of the CFA_* IDE commands were unusable from userspace
before taskfile came along and now they're a snap... 
Thanks again!
