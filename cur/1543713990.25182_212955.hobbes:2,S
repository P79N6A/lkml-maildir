About 3 years ago, the backup program amanda was having a problem with 
being unable to rewind a tape drive, while mt worked just fine.
The amanda version used an ioctl call rather than a higher level 
interface.  At the time, it was fixed by using what was a non-std 
syntax according to the docs, but it worked.  My memory is getting 
faint, but it seems that 2 of the vars in the call had to be 
interchanged, or some such.  Till somewhere about the 2.6.3, maybe 
2.6.4 time frame I believe.  Now amanda seems to have lost its 
ability to rewind a tape, and must rely on the ejection and loading 
of a tape before it can read the label and verify that this is indeed 
the correct tape for this amdump run.
Was there a bit of cleanup in the st code that brought that calls 
syntax into line with the docs in moderately recent history?
Where would I find the docs on this particular call, as it exists 
today for 2.6.5+ kernels?
