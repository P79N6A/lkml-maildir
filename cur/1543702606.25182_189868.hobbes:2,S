I'm seeing the same behaviour with a Sound Blaster AWE64 Gold. It seems 
it's not an ALSA problem though, but ISA-PnP. Enabling the card from 
userspace with the old isapnp tool makes the OPL chip appear:

That is, the driver doesn't complain anymore. Still didn't see the OPL 
appear in /proc/ioports though (loading with fm_port=0x388 doesn't 
change that). Haven't investigated further yet, will do.
