What?  cdrom_id queries the device directly to get some specific
information about the device, much like any other type of device query
(lspci, lsusb, etc.)
And yes, it would be nice if some of that information was also exported
through sysfs, and as always, patches are gladly accpeted.

Well, I can see if they are disks or cdroms through sysfs quite easily,
removable or not, so you do get more information than you expect.

I agree, again, feel free to submit patches.
