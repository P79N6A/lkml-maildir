Hello,
I have seen twice the following with a 2.2.1-ac6 kernel : a client has
not been able to mount a NFS directory although the server reported
successful authentication.
The configuration :
On the server (willy : 2.2.1-ac6, knfsd-981204) :
/etc/exports :
/u0     @urd(rw)
/u1     @urd(rw)
On the client (scar : 2.2.1-ac6) :
willy:/u0/reuse.export is successfully automounted on /usr/reuse.
I then try to mount willy:/u0 (on /willy/u0), and the mount ends up
in failure. I have to umount willy:/u0/reuse.export to be able to
mount willy:/u0.
I have tried to reproduce the failure, without success.
In the server log files, there were nothing but success :
Feb 20 21:23:09 willy mountd[317]: authenticated mount request from scar:912 
Feb 20 21:24:49 willy mountd[317]: authenticated mount request from scar:957 
Feb 20 21:24:50 willy mountd[317]: authenticated mount request from scar:959 
Feb 20 21:24:50 willy mountd[317]: authenticated mount request from scar:980 
A subsidary (?) question : is this allowed to mount willy:/u0/reuse.export
even if /u0/reuse.export does not appear in the /etc/exports file ?
(the answer seems to be YES, but since I am having a strange thing...)
A+
