I addressed this in the comment

Do you think it's important to handle?  The function already has too many
special cases and setting something several times in a row to PAGE_KERNEL
is usually a bug in the caller anyways (or a cpa bug)

I changed my mind regarding not doing this. It was true when I said it originally.

A and D should be always set for _PAGE_KERNEL and for kernel mappings in general. 
The problem would only occur if someone made up custom page flags without those.
Didn't think that usage was worth supporting. Perhaps it would be a good idea
to add a WARN_ON for this case though.
Thanks for the review.
