Maybe, but the proper way would be to use just one open for both radio and
video, like cx88. This driver violates V4L2 API, since the spec says that
opening /dev/radio will select radio, by default, but it is possible to listen
video also on that interface (the opposite is valid also for /dev/video).
I'll apply the fixes, for now. The better would be if you could try to use the
same approach present on cx88.
Cheers,
Mauro
