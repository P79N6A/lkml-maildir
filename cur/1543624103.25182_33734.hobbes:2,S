Setting the affinity of a whole process group also makes sense IMHO.
Therefore I think an interface more like the setpriority syscall
for sched_set_affinity (with two parameters which/who instead of a
single PID) would be more flexible, eg.
    int sched_set_affinity(int which, int who, unsigned int len,
                           unsigned long *new_mask_ptr);
with who one of {PRIO_PROCESS,PRIO_PGRP,PRIO_USER} and which according
to the value of who.
Getting the mask of a group of processes doesn't make sense though
(what if they differ?), so the current interface of sched_get_affinity
is just fine IMHO.
