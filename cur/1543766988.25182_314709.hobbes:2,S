OK, here is another patch. It is up to Andrew to pick the approriate.
But I still prefer the first patch, which provides both consistency in
interface and configuration.
What this patch does:
- Remove "menu" directive from fs/xfs/Kconfig, so XFS configuration is
done in the same screen as other filesystems.
- Move "config XFS_EXPORT " to the bottom, so the menu items aligns
better and consistent with others.
