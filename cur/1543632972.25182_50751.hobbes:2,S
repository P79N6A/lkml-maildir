That isn't the case.  There is no /etc/modules file on any Linux box I've
ever used. My network driver modules are loaded automatically by the kernel's
internal module loader "kmod" because the are set up correctly in /etc/modules.conf.
"alias eth0 3c905"
ALL device driver modules can be set up to load automatacally by "kmod".
