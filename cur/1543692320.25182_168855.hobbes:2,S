If you have plenty of RAM and you use cp command, you read data from disk
and copy them to RAM only, the kernel doesn't write them to disk.
If you copy more data than RAM, the data are read from disk and written to
disk again because RAM can't hold them. That's why you see 2 times
slowdown when you use machine with less RAM. It's perfectly OK.
Other unices (Solaris, IRIX) don't have dynamic cache that resizes
according to RAM, always copy data from disk to disk and so they are
order-of-magnitude slower than Linux. Did you ever tried to grep for
symbols in linux source tree unpacked on Solaris box with 512MB RAM? ---
it's just as slow as linux with very few RAM, because Solaris can't cache
data in RAM.

It doesn't matter what's copy buffer size (except for syscall overhead).
Kernel does both read-ahead and write-behind with request joining.
