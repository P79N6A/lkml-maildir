There's confusion here between two separate concepts:
a) How patches should be presented (ie: the splitup)
b) When patches are to be merged into Linus's tree.
I have been discussing a) and you've been discussing b).
Regarding b): general cleanups/fixes/etc can of course go into Linus's tree
in the usual manner.
Preparatory patches for some large feature should be delivered as separate
patches so we can see what they're doing to the kernel but they won't
normally be merged until the same day as the large feature itself.
