in theory the git merges could be generated as a flat series of patch 
files:
 x86.git.foo-fixes.patch
 x86.git.bar-updates.patch
 x86.git.foo-fixes-feh.patch
 ...
which could also include the commit log. "git-log -p" might be a 
suitable generator. For example, x86.git can be processed per commit, 
via this script:
  for N in `git-rev-list --reverse --no-merges --remove-empty master..mm`; do 
    git-log -p $N
  done
the following git-export-quilt script (just wrote it, might be buggy, so 
careful - and it blows away the patches/ directory wherever you run it) 
will generate a series file into patches/series that can be applied via 
quilt:
  rm -rf patches
  mkdir patches
  for N in `git-rev-list --reverse --no-merges --remove-empty master..mm`; do
   git-log -p -1 $N > .tmp
   export SUBJECT=`head -5 .tmp | tail -1`
   # generate filename out of subject line:
   FILE=x86.git-"`echo $SUBJECT | cut -c10- |
        tr '[:punct:] \t' '-' | tr -s - | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'`"
   # generate unique name:
   while [ -f patches/$FILE.patch ]; do FILE="$FILE"_; done
   echo $FILE.patch
   mv .tmp patches/$FILE.patch
   echo $FILE.patch >> patches/series
  done
  ls -l patches/series
i ran this script over x86.git and it produced a patch series with 247 
patches that quilt was able to push correctly. (in theory this concept 
should work for other git trees too - but i have not tried it)
this would increase the series size quite substantially though - but it 
would make cherry-picking and patch based bisection a lot easier.
