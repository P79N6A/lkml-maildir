Actually; it doesn't.  Your example below looks like this:
> mount -t tmpfs /tmp /tmp
> cd /tmp
> mkdir sub
> mount --bind sub /var
> cd /var
> mkdir sub2
> mount --move /tmp sub2
/
   /var
     /var/sub
     /var/sub2
       /var/sub2/sub
       /var/sub2/sub2
The recursion ends there.  Basically with the first bind mount you  
attach the same instance of tmpfs to /tmp and /var, then you move the  
tmpfs from /tmp to the "/sub2" directory in the "/var" tmpfs  
_mountpoint_.  It's kind of confusing behavior; but the directory  
tree and the mount tree are basically kind of separate entities in a  
sense.

Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.   
Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by  
definition, not smart enough to debug it.
