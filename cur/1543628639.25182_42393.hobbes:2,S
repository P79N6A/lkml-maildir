I'd recommend you grab the pcnet32 out of the larger ppc64 patch.
For pSeries (AKA Rs/6000) we have pcnet32 cards all over the place and
have
had to "fix" some things with the driver from time to time.  
See www.linuxppc64.org for the patches. 
(Grab say like the 2.4.18 patch, gunzip it and then
edit the patch by had, delete all the lives above and below 
the specific patch for pcnet32, save it and then apply that)
