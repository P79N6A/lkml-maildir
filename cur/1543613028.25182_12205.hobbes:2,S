Andrea, it seems -aa is not the holy grail VM-wise. If you want
to merge your good stuff with marcelo, please do it in the
"one patch with explanation per problem" style marcelo asked.
If nothing happens I'll take my chainsaw and remove the whole
use-once stuff just so 2.4 will avoid the worst cases, even if
it happens to remove some of the nice stuff you've been working
on.
regards,
Rik
