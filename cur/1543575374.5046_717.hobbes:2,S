One problem with warnings at compile time is that in many cases, administrators
use kernels provided by friends or collegues that "know linux better than them".
If an admin uses a kernel in which write support has been activated to mount
an NTFS file system without providing any option, he will get it mount R/W
without any warning, then may destroy it at the first mistake or so.
perhaps we should add an option such as "force" to mount an NTFS r/w, and as
suggested by JBG, print a KERN_EMERG message when attempting to mount it r/w
without the "force" option.
we could also add a static counter which will make the first r/w mount always
fail, to ensure people will read the message, and which would prevent people
from mounting r/w from fstab.
just my $0.02.
BTW, I like the message about microsoft preventing from fixing the driver ;-)
Cheers,
Willy
