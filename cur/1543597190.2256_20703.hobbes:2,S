Hi,
I'm very new at this, so here goes:
I'm trying to write a scsi driver, and everything (device detection, 
reading/writing to partition tables) works fine, until I try to mkfs any 
partition larger than 200 megs.  When it's over 200 megs, it would hang on 
writing to the inode tables for ~20 seconds, then spit out many i/o errors.  
Is there a reason why mkfs would work for partitions <200 megs and not for 
partitions larger than that?
Kernel: 2.4.2-2
mke2fs: 1.19
CPU: Pentium Pro 200mhz
Memory: 48mb physical, 256mb swap
I would really appreciate any help, and please cc: any responses to this to 
this email address because I'm not on the mailing list.
Thanks, Alan
