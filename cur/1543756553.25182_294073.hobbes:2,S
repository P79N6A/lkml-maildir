Wrong, if I wanted to violate the license, I could have done so already 
and I certainly wouldn't make such a fuss about it.
To remind you the main problem was and is still, that the kernel history 
is locked into bk. At this point I'm not really sure, whether all bk user 
realize this, as you constantly try to distract them with random 
accusation against my person.

That's of course a noble goal, but what if such help is attached to 
conditions? Then it might of course happen that such help is rejected, 
the question is only where is the problem. For you it's of course clear it 
must be the potential receivers fault, looking critically at the 
conditions is out of question for you.

Another smoke bomb. You already made it clear, that even if I did that, I 
couldn't import the kernel history into it anyway. There are already 
possible alternatives, which should be able to store the kernel history as 
currently recorded in bk, but we will never know because any attempt to do 
so will be constructed as license violation.
I skipped all the insults, which you use to further distract attention 
from the actual problem and instead try to descredit me personally. You 
must be getting quite desperate to start hitting that low. :(
bye, Roman
