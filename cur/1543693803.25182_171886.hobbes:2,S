Well... I was thinking more in terms of a rw_semaphore to lock out new
calls to nfs_file_(read|write|sendfile) in combination with a call to
invalidate_inode_pages2().
Such a mechanism can also be used in schemes to improve on the generic
data/attribute cache consistency in order to reduce the number of
bogus cache invalidations due to RPC ordering races. Those can tend to
be expensive...
Note: Anybody using mmap() in combination with file locking will
however continue to enjoy the privilege of being able to screw up...
Cheers,
