Hi!
I'm trying to compile a project using the crypt()-function under the
2.2.1 kernel. This program was developed on a 2.0.35 kernel and worked
well so far. But under the new kernel I get the gcc-message '/tmp/123.o
undefined reference to crypt' (something like that) and gcc won't link it.
I've also read something about the crypt() function not being embedded in
the official kernel. Could anybody be more specific on that, please.
Thanks
	Matthias Rosenkranz
