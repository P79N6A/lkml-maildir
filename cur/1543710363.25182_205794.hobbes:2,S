If you're only seeing 12Mbit/s (b=bit, B=byte) already before
then there's something at play here with your network I'm afraid.
Replace the nics and you'll see the problems should go away.
I haven't seen any problems so far with my equipment.

My laptop has an 8139 and it works fine.

If you don't solve it I'll check with my Rhine.

Start by getting it up to 100Mbit on the old kernel and then ask
for more help as 12Mbit/s points to other problems.
