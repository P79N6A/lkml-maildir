Software Environment:
Problem Description:
  System "hangs" with logging of messages:
    "Attempting to queue an ABORT message"
  Only resort is to reset the machine.
Steps to reproduce:
  Problem seems to occur during high load on concurrent disk I/O when
running in
multi-processor mode. The problem does not occur if system is booted with a
single-processor kernel (SMP disabled in kernel build).
