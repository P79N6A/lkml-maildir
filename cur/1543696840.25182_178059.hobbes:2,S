The PCI specification requires that all devices be able to share
an interrupt. If the provided driver won't allow this, then it is
broken. You need to contact the vendor.
Also, since the GPIB specification requires that a machine be addressed
to talk before it can talk, etc., you can see that hangs are possible
unless the driver is carefully designed to time-out if the talker doesn't
talk or the listener doesn't listen. Even if you have good hardware,
real-world use may require you to write your own driver. For instance,
a data-transfer is happening between a device and your PC. Somebody
turns off the device. You don't want to have to re-boot. Many
hardware vendors don't have a clue about real-world applications when
they make a so-called "driver". You use they code as an example
of how to talk to their board. You make the real driver yourself.

We don't know if 00:09.0 is your board, but a header type 04
is currently not defined. There are three header types, 0->2.
Type one is for PCI-PCI bridges.
Type two is for PCI-Cardbus bridges.
All others are type zero. The specification says ALL others
are type zero, not "some of the others".

lspci will only show a configured controller. Normally the BIOS will
configure it. Eventually the kernel may re-configure it. However,
with an incorrect header, this won't happen. The board vendor
may have "worked-around" this problem with his driver by forcing
bits into configuration registers to make it "function". This
has a fatal flaw in that a module (driver) doesn't have enough
information available to successfully allocate I/O space on its
own.

See above. Return board. Look on Web-sites for others, Hint; National
Instruments. They work.
