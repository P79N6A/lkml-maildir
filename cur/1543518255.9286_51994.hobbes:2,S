I didn't think that there were many changes between 2.7.2.1
and 2.7.2.3 (it was documented only to enable support for glibc2)
Anyway I upgraded to gcc version 2.7.2.3
and enabled SMP and attempted to rebuild the kernel again
and got the same error
time.c: In function `do_gettimeofday':
time.c:262: fixed or forbidden register was spilled.
This may be due to a compiler bug or to impossible asm
statements or clauses.
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.3.30/arch/i386/kernel'
in do_gettimeofday() the line
        read_lock_irqsave(&xtime_lock, flags); 
expands to a call to 
	read_lock( &xtime_lock );
along with other lines
and in do_settimeofday() 
	write_lock_irq(&xtime_lock);
expands to a call to 
	write_lock( &xtime_lock ); 
when I preprocesed the file with -E
and commented out
	read_lock( &xtime_lock );
and
	write_lock( &xtime_lock ); 
in their respective functions I was able to compile
without the above error message.
Looking at read_lock it seems the problem can be narrowed down
to the macro __build_read_lock_ptr()
in include/asm-i386/rwlock.h
#define __build_read_lock_ptr(rw, helper)   \
    asm volatile(LOCK "subl $1,(%0)\n\t" \
             "js 2f\n" \
             "1:\n" \
             ".section .text.lock,\"ax\"\n" \
             "2:\tcall " helper "\n\t" \
             "jmp 1b\n" \
             ".previous" \
             ::"a" (rw) : "memory")
This is about as far as I can go with extended asm,
although I'd love to learn a bit more.
  does &xtime_lock need to be in eax
   what does .previous mean (info gas doesn't describe it)
I assume it has something to do with restoring
the .section pseudo-op, but where is this documented
