I once tried to apply the O(1) scheduler on 2.4.18-pre9 + aa vm and I
made a similar change (the O(1) patch was rejected on buffer.c) and it
caused so corruption on my file system (ext2), but I'm still not sure
what cause it that change was my main concern. I think Ingo is using
sys_sched_yield(); instead of yield. I will still be carefull about it
though.
