It's not better at all, but unfortunately, UPX cannot compress a kernel which
embeds a big initramfs. The problem is that the compressed initramfs is
embedded into vmlinux, which is then compressed into bzImage, and UPX only
replaces the bzImage compression.
May be it would work if we did not compress the initramfs before including
it into the vmlinux.
