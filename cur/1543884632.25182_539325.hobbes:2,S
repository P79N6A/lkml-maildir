I.e. new modules:
	ieee1394 (was fw-core)
	ohci1394 (was fw-ohci)
	sbp2     (was fw-sbp2)
	eth1394  (to be done) --- but that's a bad name anyway, it
                                  implements IP over 1394, not Ethernet
old modules, for example:
	ieee1394-old
	ohci1394-old
	sbp2-old
	eth1394-old
	pcilynx    (unless somebody plans to port it, then pcilynx-old)
	raw1394    (or rename it too?, it requires ieee1394-old)
	video1394  (ditto)
	dv1394     (ditto)
Looks... weird.
On the other hand, a 1394 module compilation cycle in order to do the
fallback is not such a huge issue, except that it requires the person to
be able to compile modules.  That's probably the main issue.

We could rename some of the existing source files to make the
distinction clearer.

But then, what is the actual utility of pcilynx?  (I mean the current
driver, not the card or a future driver.)  Last time I checked, sbp2 was
broken without OHCI's physical DMA, and AFAIK raw1394's newer iso API
and video1394 and dv1394 don't work with pcilynx either.
Porting pcilynx to the new low-level API would be quite resource
demanding --- seen in relation to which resources we have, what the
existing pcilynx driver's state of affairs is, and how rare the hardware
is.  (For those who have the hardware, the stand-alone Nosy is
undoubtedly the killer application, not pcilynx.)
