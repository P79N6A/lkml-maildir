That's not easy to say, the square bracketed hex numbers scroll with a speed

Let's hope that this will lead to some action...

Anyone got some pointers where to get the necessary info? What we learned at
college didn't include real<->protected mode switches and the like (hey, at
least we were the first semester to learn x86 assembler instead of the Z80 or
whatever the ones before us did learn...). I might warm up some long lost
knowledge and have my first contribution to the kernel (at a point where I
can't do much harm... good :-)
