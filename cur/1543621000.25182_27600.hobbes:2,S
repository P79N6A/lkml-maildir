From personal experience software RAID is quite fast, and very reliable
regarding failures while running. If a disk fails the system drops back to
recovery, and after a new drive is added and `raidhotadd' is run it is
rebuilt.
The dark side of the force is that is a drive fails on boot, I have had
problems getting the system to boot (even when not the boot drive). The
system doesn't always recognize that there is a failed drive, and I've had
to build a new raid config with "failed disk" entries to get the system
up. Later version may be better at that (comments, please), I have not had
to address this in over a year, since most of my system are not taken down
unless they fall down.
