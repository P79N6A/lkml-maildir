	Speaking of indisputable logic...
	Folks, for those of you who werent here...we went through this
entire GNU/Linux thread in much more detail a couple of months ago.  
There is absolutely no reason on earth this should be on the kernel list
in the first place, but some of us REALLY don't wanna have to make heavy
use of procmail here...dealing with it the first time was bad enough, 
twice is totally unacceptable.  I shouldn't have to feel like I either
only need to accept posts from a few people here into my mailbox, or that
I should unsub because I don't have time to delete all this nonsense.
	I know you're all hot to say your pieces, but...just drop it.
There's no law that says you HAVE to correct someone on the list, as
compelling as it may be at times.  Especially when it is completely and
totally off topic for the list.
