The same problem that I had from kernel 2.4.18-10 is also happening in 
kernel 2.5.39.  I have mostly narrowed this down to the ehci-hcd module as 
I can unload the module and everything works normally.
My problem occurs when I attach two USB 2.0 mass storage devices (a 120 GB 
hard drive and a 16x IOMEGA CD-RW) to my cardbus USB 2.0 controller.  My 
CD-RW acts very strange and cdrecord is unable to even determine the name 
of the device (through cdrecord -scanbus).
Anyway, after a while, the hard drive will stop responding and a few error 
messages will occur from scsi and ext3:
SCSI disk error : host 0 channel 0 lun 0 return code = 70000
end_request: I/O error, dev 08:00 sector 13638947
Buffer I/O error on device sd(8,2), logical block 1441804
I got the device to once again respond by unplugging the hard drive
and plugging it back in.
Thanks,
Stephen Marz
