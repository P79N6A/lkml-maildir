I really did not want to belittle you - but in hindsight it really reads 
that way ... sorry about that and how insensitive it was from me! :(
I just wanted to point out that if kdump is useful it must be _visible_. 
Ask commit logs to include "this was debugged via kdump" lines, etc. The 
upstream kernel must feel that it all matters.
The upstream kernel really has to be ruthless about such things and must 
react to how things are not to how things are wished to be - one of the 
most critical things is that keeps Linux ticking is people like you who 
report and debug problems.
Note, back when kdump was added to the kernel many moons ago i strongly 
supported it and helped out with the patches, etc. I still think it might 
have the potential to become big - but it needs a ton of tech and care to 
reach that level of convenience.
'kdump light' perhaps that dumps the most important data structures like 
registers of all CPUs, task struct and the symbol tables, the current task 
itself including the kernel stack plus the surrounding 4K of all pointers 
that are in current registers and that point into kernel memory - maybe 
straight to kerneloops.org [if the user agrees] - or something like that.
