Hi again.
I'm not sure if this is because of the patch or what, but my X crashes
normally in ~2 days, and the framebuffer gets all messy (green lines,
can't see what I'm typing, etc.), this doesn't happen with your patch at
all, only with vanilla kernel(s). Maybe my hardware likes your patch or
something. My X have been running for four days now without any kind of
problem on the patched kernel. (I'm not sure if it's the kernel or what,
but reported it anyway). That's the only problem I've been getting more
than often.
There's no other problems, only that the kernel standard scheduler is a
bit slower than yours.
Regards,
Markus
