(2) isn't realistic.  There's no such thing as a suid program.  Suid is a 
characteristic of a _file_.  There's no way to know whether a given 
executing program is running with privileges that came from a suid file 
getting exec'ed.  Bear in mind that that exec could be pretty remote -- 
done by a now-dead ancestor with three more execs in between.
Many user space programs contain hacks to try to discern this information, 
and they often cause me headaches and I have to fix them.  The usual hacks 
are euid==uid, euid==suid, and/or euid==0.  It would be an order of 
magnitude worse for the kernel to contain such a hack.
