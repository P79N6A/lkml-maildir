Right.

I've not yet done any real tests with it, so I'm not sure. We were
mostly going from the theoretical description ;) But I think 128k/s is
really a bit low, so I assume something ain't quite right yet... We'll
figure it out.
It's possible that maybe it's not the way to go afterall, but before we
could go looking we first needed it as GPL/LGPL (for not becoming
IP-tainted).
