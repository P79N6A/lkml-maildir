Given that you don't even understand that this message is issued by the
*shell* and not /bin/rm, and *why* it issues that sort of error message
when an argument string expands to be bigger than MAX_ARGV, and the fact
that there are extant patches to increase that to essentially any reasonable
size, why should we listen to you when you proclaim that you have any sort
of enlightenment about systems design?
