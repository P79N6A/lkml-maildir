You are mistaken. The current scheduler only uses a single array
for realtime tasks. Functionality would be trivial to implement
now.

I'd defer a final decision to others more knowlegeable of course
(Ingo, Andrew, Linus?), however it would be almost out of the
question to do a wholesale replacement in 2.6.
However well tested your scheduler might be, it needs several
orders of magnitude more testing ;) Maybe the best we can hope
for is compile time selectable alternatives.
