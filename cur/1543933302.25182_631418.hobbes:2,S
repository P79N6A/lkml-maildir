there's one issue i have with this document, and that's that i wish it
more carefully distinguished between regular git "user" tasks, and git
"developer" tasks.
i may be mistaken, but it would seem that a lot of folks are going to
be what i call basic users, who only want to update their git tree,
check the logs, check the status and so on.  and if they start to get
ambitious, they might make some changes to the tree, do a diff, and
submit a patch.  but in the beginning, they won't be making commits or
switching branches, etc.
in short, i can see the value of something like a "getting started
with git as a basic user" tutorial.  does such a thing exist?
