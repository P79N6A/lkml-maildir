I've looked at an implementation of something similar. The approach was as
follows:
* insert a "hook" into the netif_rx that would act as a filter
* use a module that:
	* activates hook
	* apply filtering
	* sends back packets to netif_rx for normal processing
* when module is unloaded, deactivate the "hook"
