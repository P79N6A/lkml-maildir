I can prompt an oops by pinging my router while the apic errors are
scrolling by.

A full raft of documentation -- including acpidump and
linux-firmware-kit output, console capture, kernel config, lspci -vvxxx
(with apic=debug boot option), dmesg, and /proc/interrupts -- is
available at 
http://www.hogchain.net/m2v/apic-problem/
If this is a motherboard problem, that's fine; I'd just like to know
the details so I tell users something more than "it's a motherboard
problem."
Thanks,
Jay
