Well, it keeps things simple for the kernel, and bootimg(8) needs
to know the target architecture anyway. But there isn't really a
design reason why it would have to use pages, agreed.

Yes, I was thinking of
 - BIOS does IDE bus scan, boots boot loader kernel
 - first kernel does IDE bus scan again, boots real kernel
 - real kernel does IDE bus scan again
It should be possible to avoid at least the third IDE bus scan, at
least as an optimization.

You can always look it up in /dev/mem, just like bootimg(1) did :-)
BTW, that's what I like about this approach: incremental development
is much easier this way, and you can hide all the ugly spots in the
library, if necessary.

Touche ;-) I admit that I'm not much of an ELF expert. This was just
a surprisingly easy hack, so I was content with what I got.
