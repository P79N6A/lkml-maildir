First of all, what format is the data on the drives? ext2 or fat?
What mfm card are you using? I assume it is an isa card.  (I have never 
heard of a pci mfm card.)
If this is a one time thing, you might try tracking down an older version 
of Linux. (One with XT drive support.)
If you can't find one, contact me off-line.  I have versions going back to 
the Yggdrasil beta.  An old version of Slackware should work.
