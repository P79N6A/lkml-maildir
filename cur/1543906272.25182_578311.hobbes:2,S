It's case-by-case I think. In zone order with ZONE_MOVABLE case,
user's page cache will not use ZONE_NORMAL until ZONE_MOVABLE in all node
is exhausted. This is an expected behavior, I think.
I think the real problem is the scheme for "How to set zone movable size to
appropriate value for the system". This needs more study and documentation.
(but maybe depends on system configuration to some extent.)
