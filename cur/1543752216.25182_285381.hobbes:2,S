That's not good.
2.4.29 should ideally be 2.4.9 with a buttload of bug fixes.  Same with
2.6.5/2.6.9.  Major feature differences should ideally come with majors,
i.e. 2.0->2.2->2.4->2.6
A few bugfix backports may be fine, though that's already light to fair
work (depending on how many security bugs are being found and need
backporting, versus how many can patch clean without porting); How do
you people maintain 4 ACTIVE branches?
oi, whatever.
