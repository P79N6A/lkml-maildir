And you suddenly imposed decisions on people.
Wether or not you are an expert it is reasonable to expect that you
want to use modules just as it is just as reasonable to expect that
you do not. In some cases you want your Ethernet as a module in some
case you want the low level SCSI driver but not the SCSI mid
layer.

Or wants to use modules. And yes Aunt Tillie might want to do so, if
the person who sold her her Linux CD provided a bunch of scripts for
packing up things in a specific way.

Bzzzzt wrong. The MVME cards are still heavily used in control systems
and similar places. It's the only place where m68k usage is not dying
for real.

So far the introduction of CML2 has been overly disppointing, from day
one it's been 'I have this great idea and since I think it's great,
you obviously have to think so as well'.
Now I take it the derived rules are still only enforced under the
'novice' option, though you haven't exactly made that clear in the
discussion (nor did you do so when you initially brought it up).
