i might also be SuSE 7.1 related, since this was the first kernel i
compiled on the new distro.
but since the problem arose only with the new aic driver, i thought
it might be that you had a slightly different development

-------------------
#!/bin/sh
bison --yacc $*
-------------------
i ran into the same problem with a school proiject here yesterday
