I'm thinking about initrd+klibc not rpms+libc,
fs is a lower level than DM - fs crash is not a problem here.

The same what happens when your kernel image gets corrupted,
probability is similar.

The same what happens when your kernel driver gets out of sync.

The same what happens when "something" wrong goes with kernel.

It doesn't need any knowledge of config files, initrd, ramfs etc.

It won't require user to run any commands.
RAID card gets detected and initialized -> hotplug event happens ->
user-land configuration tools executed etc.

glibc is not needed/recommend here.

Faster/easier development - user-space apps don't OOPS. :-)
Somebody else than kernel people have to update user-land. :-)

SCSI driver is a low-level stuff - it needs direct hardware access.
Even 65k is still a bloat - think about vendor kernel including support
for all possible RAID flavors.  If they are modular - they require initrd
so may as well be put to user-land.

ATARAID drivers are just moving in this direction...
ASR+DDF will also follow this way... sooner or later...
