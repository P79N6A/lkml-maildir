Correct, so we must stick with the delayed work structure
which requires calling the delayed work function.

That does not make sense to me.
If you are calling from interrupt context, you do not want
to call flush_to_ldisc() directly regardless of low_latency.
This used to be the way it was done and it ended up causing
deadlocks in just that situation.
And the initial schedule has no reason to add the extra delay.
