I tend to agree.  It should be obvious which sort of mounts are safe
and which are not.  The exceptions can go into fstab.
In a private namespace environment bind mounts (nodev,nosuid) should
be OK.  Network filesystems (with limitations to the ports used) are
also.  Disk filesystems are usually not safe to mount for users,
because they are not tested and verified against untrusted source.
