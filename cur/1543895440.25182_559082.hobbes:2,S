I think we need to distinguish between relying on restorecond-like
mechanisms for the security of SELinux vs. relying on them for emulating
pathname-based security.  The former would be a problem.  The latter is
no worse than pathname-based security already, because pathname-based
security is inherently ambiguous and non-tranquil, and revocation isn't
addressed fully in AA either.
