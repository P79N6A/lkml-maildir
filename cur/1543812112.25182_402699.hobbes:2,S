Hi,
     apologies for the delay in replying I've been out of the country.
I'm using the 2.6.15.2 kernel. I know that the bug is only appearing when
I'm using the raid6 driver in combination with my hardware. I've yet to
narrow it down any further though and would appreciate it if anyone could
give me a better idea as to how to narrow down the cause of the problem.
regards,
mike

Does this problem pop up without the RAID6 driver also. That may be
helpful in isolating the bug.
