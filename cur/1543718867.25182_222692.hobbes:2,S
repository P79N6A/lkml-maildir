New information :)
I didn't profile it yet but I think I found what caused the problem.
It turned out that I have to disable alsa mmap-support in xine (mplayer worked w/o problems, it does not offer alsa mmap), so X is not involved at all. Do you still need a profile or is this a known thing?
Ah, before I forget, my userspace is 32bit-only, I have a 64-bit chroot I wanted to do some testing with.
