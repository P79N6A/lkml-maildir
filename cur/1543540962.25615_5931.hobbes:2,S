	Will check on this soonest .  It should be 100 half duplex .
	I have an older diag. tool But I'll go grab the one from scyld's

	Changed the cable already & the port .  Haven't tried the HtoH yet
	though .  For my info , is there an equivalent to speedo_debug for
	the tulip cards ?  That you are aware of ?  I went scanning thru
	the sources for both & didn't find an item I could recognise such
	as the above .  I have to be blind .
	The other aside is that under 2.2.13 this did not happen .  Or at
	least if it did it happened so fast as to be unnoticable .
