Hi All,
 I have been using amanada for about 3 months now, and have found it
works pretty but I have noticed a particular problem. Sometimes Amanda
makes a mess of the estimate of compression, and tries to
put on a tape more than will actually  fit. Amanda apparently fails
gracefully leaving the untaped portion on the disk. However I have
noticed that, even after changing the tape amanda always says the tape
is full, and I cannot do any more amflushes or amdumps until I reboot
the computer.  Is this likely to be an amanda problem or a linux kernel
problem? Has anyone else seen this? I am using a SCSI tape drive - the
HP Surestore Dat 24.
Thanks in advance,
Nicholas Waltham
