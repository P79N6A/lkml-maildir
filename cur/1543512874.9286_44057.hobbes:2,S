Jumping into the middle of the discussion -- I'm sure that one of you
has thought of this already, but, just to make sure:
Is this running on a 16550 type UART or a 16450?  The 16450 will almost
certainly lose characters running at those speeds.  No FIFO, just doesn't
leave the CPU enough time to read the data out between interrupts.
Just my $.02 worth...
