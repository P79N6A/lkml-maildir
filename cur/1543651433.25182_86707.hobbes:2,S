I find that hard to believe.  You're saying it's impossible to use a
software debugger to debug the interface between the software and the
hardware?  Eg. errors in the hardware that cause periodic anomalies in the
output read by the software would be one thing they could catch, along
with diagnosing that a problem is caused by flaky hardware rather than the
latest not-well-tested VM code.  In that last case, since bad hardware can
usually cause a panic, I see crash dumps as an invaluable resource ;-).
