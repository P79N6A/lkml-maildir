Applied. It compiles now. Did a reboot into the new kernel and it hangs
somewhere in the point where it blanks the display but before it
switches to the framebuffer to display the kernel output messages (hope
that helps). I have no oops or anything. Just a blank display and no
disc activity or anything. ctrl-alt-del don't work and I have to turn my
laptop off in order to reboot.
