Hello!

   Do we need to distinguish between user and group quotas if the file structure
will be otherwise the same?

   Maybe we should insert several reserved fields to both the header and the
entries to make some room for additional expansion and also to align the
structures, so that they won't cross disk block boundary.
				Have a nice fortnight
