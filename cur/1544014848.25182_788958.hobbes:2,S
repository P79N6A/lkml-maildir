I think core_initcall is too late to be initializing 
irq_default_affinity.  This happens way after init_IRQ() is called and 
for my target (mips/cavium_octeon) after the timer and SMP related irqs 
are setup.
I had been setting irq_default_affinity in init_IRQ(), and I could 
probably do it later with no real problem, but this seems wrong to me. 
Data that is potentially used in interrupt configuration and processing 
should be initialized before it is used.
