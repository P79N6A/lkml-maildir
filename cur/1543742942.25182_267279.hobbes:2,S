When "dec" is placed before "ror", throughput goes up by about 5%
on my test system (Opteron 244 rev C0). I don't find it "ugly"
because the optimization no intrusive at all (only 1 moved instruction).
Concerning the "dec / sub $1" case, it makes absolutely no difference
on the Opteron, I just used "dec" because the opcode is 3 bytes length
instead of 4.
