In the latest kernel, there is an optimized sha1 routine 
(arch/arm/lib/sha1.S) meant to override the generic one in lib/sha1.c.
The problem is that lib/lib.a is listed _before_ arch/arm/lib/lib.a in 
the link argument list so the architecture specific lib functions are 
not picked up in priority.
To work around this the following patch is needed:
--- a/arch/arm/Makefile
+++ b/arch/arm/Makefile
@@ -142,7 +142,7 @@ drivers-$(CONFIG_OPROFILE)      += arch/
 drivers-$(CONFIG_ARCH_CLPS7500)	+= drivers/acorn/char/
 drivers-$(CONFIG_ARCH_L7200)	+= drivers/acorn/char/
 
-libs-y				+= arch/arm/lib/
+libs-y				:= arch/arm/lib/ $(libs-y)
 
 # Default target when executing plain make
 ifeq ($(CONFIG_XIP_KERNEL),y)
However I was wondering if there should be a better and generic way to 
fix that.
Comments?
