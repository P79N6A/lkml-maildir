	This appears to be the issue.  If I load hw_random and run rngd, 
then the pauses go away.  I may have been confused about the keyboard 
-- I probably only typed a couple characters, which I guess wasn't 
enough input.
	Any idea why I wouldn't see this under 2.4?  Perhaps something I
missed moving from /etc/modules.conf to /etc/modprobe.conf?  I didn't see 
anything about random in there, and /dev/hwrandom didn't even exist (I 
had to mknod it).
Thanks,
	Aaron
