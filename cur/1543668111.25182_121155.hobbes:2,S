Sure. On NUMA-Q mem_map[] is not allocated using bootmem except for
node 0. Various other bootmem allocations are also proportional to
memory as measured in units of PAGE_SIZE, but not all.
So all we're seeing here is node 0's mem_map[] with "miscellaneous"
bootmem allocations thrown in, whether reduced or increased.
This is not very reflective of what's going on as the majority of mem_map[]
is allocated through a custom reservation mechanism as opposed to bootmem.
