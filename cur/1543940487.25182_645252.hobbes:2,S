Thats exactly right.

Yeah, I think I am taking shortcuts in the language ;).  I wanted the root_domain to be an object of shared data that sits at the "root sched_domain", or in other terms the terminating parent in the hierarchy.  And there is one of these suckers created every time a non-overlapping cpuset is created (which was called "exclusive" at the time I wrote it, I believe, but I keep forgetting what you said they are called now ;).  So because the non-overlapping cpuset configuration begat the sched_domain hierarchy, I started using them interchangeably.  Sorry for the confusion :)

No, I think you nailed it.

Very good idea.  Thanks for doing this!
