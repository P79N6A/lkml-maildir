Ryan, can you test 2.6.15-rc4 and report what it does?
The "Bad page state" messages may (should) remain, but the crashes should 
be gone and the machine should hopefully continue functioning fine. And, 
perhaps more importantly, you should hopefully have a _new_ message about 
incomplete pfn mappings that should help pinpoint which driver causes 
this..
