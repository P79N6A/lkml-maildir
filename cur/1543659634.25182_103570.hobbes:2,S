A better reference for this stuff is (IMHO) AP-485, the "Intel Processor
Identification and the CPUID Instruction" application note. It's regularly
updated, and in this particular case, its description of CPUID with EAX=1
differs from the IA32 Volume 2 manual (245471xx) in two ways:
- EBX bit 31 is called "SBF", Signal Break on FERR.
- ECX is defined to contain additional feature flags. Currently only one
  is defined: ECX bit 10 is the "Context ID" feature for putting the L1
  D-cache in adaptive or shared mode, which matters for hyper-threaded CPUs.
Supporting the new ECX feature flags in the kernel will require some surgery,
since the current code assumes x86_capability[0] is Intel, [1] is AMD,
[2] is Transmeta, and [3] is for conflicting or synthesized feature flags.
We either shift AMD etc down one index and put ECX in [1], or add a new index
[4] for ECX, or kludge the few ECX-defined features in [3].
