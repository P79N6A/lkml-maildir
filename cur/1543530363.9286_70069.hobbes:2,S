Hello!
	I have a soyo 6BA+IV motherboard that comes with HPT366
chip to provide two ATA66 ide channels, so I installed the ide kernel
patch to support it.
	I have a 13Gb Quantum Fireball CR ATA66 and when I connect
it to IDE standard interface the system interprets the right geometry, but
when I connect it to the ATA66 interface, the system interprets as 8Gb
hard disk.
  Any suggestion??
Thanks in advance.
