I do not know how 'bad' the situation is now that we have the dirty page
tracking stuff, still need to create a test environment.
But the general idea is that its broken because the ACK from writeout
can be delayed and the remaining free memory taken by other incomming
network packets.
Until I have a test setup and some reproducable deadlocks I cannot say
more I'm afraid.
