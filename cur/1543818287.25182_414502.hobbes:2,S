Agreed.  That is ugly.  I would recommend some new functions
list functions but in thinking about this I believe I see
how we can avoid this case completely.
The first step is to optimize thread_group_leader to be
defined in terms of tasks and not process ids.  Which
is one less pointer dereference.
The second step is to modify de_thread to reduce the
old thread group leader to a thread.  This requires changing the
leaders parents, changing the leaders thread_group leader, unhashing
the leader from the process group and session, and removing
the leader from the task list.
With those two changes exit.c should not need to account for 
the de_thread case.
Oleg please take a hard look and see if you can find anything
that will break with the patch below.
I believe that is all that is needed to cleanly keep do_each_thread
from seeing a single thread multiple times.
