I don't see how that can be.  The stack dump is getting unwieldy so I
haven't duplicated it here, but if I'm reading it right the problem occurs
when usb_set_interface() is called by usb_unbind_interface(), which itself
is called indirectly by device_unregister() above.  The pointer for the
interface being unregistered has not yet been set to NULL, hence this
shouldn't cause an oops.
