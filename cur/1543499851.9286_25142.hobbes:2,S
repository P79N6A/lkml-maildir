No, the normal case being _nothing_. Neither symlink nor other wormhole.

Why?
They are NOT different.
They are only different because you _think_ they are different. Get over
your hangups with old implementations of symlinks, and you will notice
that it's _exactly_ the same issue as with any other "magic wormhole".
I agree about code duplication, but if that's your concern then you should
just create a "generic_file_symlink()", the same way we condense the
common code for "generic_file_read()" and "generic_file_write()". That has
nothing to do with whether it is recursive or not.
