In order to migrate a page one first has to make sure that userspace and
the kernel cannot access the page in any way. User space must be made to
generate page faults and all kernel references must be accounted for and
not be in use.
The user space portion involves changing the page tables so that faults
are generated.
The kernel portion isolates the page from the LRU (to exempt it from
kernel reclaim handling etc).
Only then can the page and its metadata be copied to a new location.
Guess you already have the LRU portion done. So you just need the user
space isolation portion?
