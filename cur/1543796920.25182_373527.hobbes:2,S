The linked kernel+module combination is pretty clearly a derived work
(but I am not a lawyer).  However, that never gets *distributed* and
the GPL only covers distribution rights.
The question of whether or not something which *could* be linked into
the kernel is a derived work is a very different question, and if
taken too far, an advocate of this interpretation starts advocating
something very close to interface copyrights --- something which I
will note the FSF is passionately against when they called a boycott
on companies such as Lotus many years ago.
But this is very much off-topic for this list.  I suggest that folks
talk to Larry Rosen for his view on this issue, if they want a
balanced counterpoint to that pushed by the FSF.
