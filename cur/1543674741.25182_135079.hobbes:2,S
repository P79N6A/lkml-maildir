Yes it does of course.
BTW FYI these are the warnings I see in ACPI when compiling with gcc 3.3 for
64bit:
drivers/acpi/processor.c: In function `acpi_processor_add_fs':
drivers/acpi/processor.c:1518: warning: assignment from incompatible pointer typ e
drivers/acpi/processor.c:1531: warning: assignment from incompatible pointer typ e
drivers/acpi/thermal.c:187: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer ty pe
drivers/acpi/thermal.c:195: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer ty poe
  drivers/acpi/thermal.c:203: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type
drivers/acpi/utils.c: In function `acpi_evaluate_reference':
drivers/acpi/utils.c:351: warning: unsigned int format, different type arg (arg 
5)
