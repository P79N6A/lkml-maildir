I've just been informed that megaraid has command ring addressing 
limitations, so you may not be able to use this card in PCI-X mode at 
all, at least on your Altix.  You can force it into PCI mode by putting 
an old PCI device in the same bus though, I think, that might get things 
working (without my patch).
