Voyager is in the same boat as NUMA-Q.  The machines can have up to eight CPU 
card slots and each slot can take up to a quad CPU card (with the clock 
generator on the CPU card) so TSCs cannot synchronise accross the quads.  
Worse, for voyager, the CPUs and clocks can be radically different frequencies 
(I run a dual quad system here with one quad at 100MHz and one at 166MHz)
Voyager can also run with ancient dyad 486 CPU cards (I still have some) which 
do lack the TSC feature entirely.  However, I don't use the smpboot.c file to 
boot with, so if you want changes in there that's fine by me, I'll just hook 
the voyager boot sequence into them.
