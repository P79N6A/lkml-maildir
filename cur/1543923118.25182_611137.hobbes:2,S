Let me repeat what I have said before in another context. The past discussions 
on linux-kernel were useful for a while, and we got constructive feedback 
which we could act upon, but then the feedback became very non-constructive 
again, and you NACKed patches without giving any good reasons. I have asked 
for specific feedback but didn't get any in:
 - Rejecting the vfsmount additions,
   
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=118350187712375
 - VFS layering fuck-up accusation,
   
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=118348050804600
So can we pick up things there again, and have a real discussion about the 
things you criticize?
Thanks,
Andreas
