Let's see if I've understood that correctly:
	Block size	Can address		Total	Formula
	~~~~~~~~~~	~~~~~~~~~~~		~~~~~	~~~~~~~
	    1k		256*256*256*1024	 16G	(1k)^4/64
	    4k		1024*1024*1024*4096	  4T	(4k)^4/64
Presumably...
	    2k		512*512*512*2048	256G	(2k)^4/64
	    8k		2048*2048*2048*8192	 64T	(8k)^4/64
If so, then for any given block size B, we can address (B^4)/64 blocks
using the ext2 file system?
Would I also be right in thinking that if we were able to do one more
level of indirect block, we would multiply the capacities by B/4 in
each case, giving capacities of 4T, 64T, 1E and 16E for ext2 file
systems using 1k, 2k, 4k and 8k blocks respctively?
Best wishes from Riley.
