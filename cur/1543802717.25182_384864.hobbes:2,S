Very good. I suggested this because the PW 380 is a poster child of the
buggy BIOS, and also of industry involvement: Dell fixed the problems
for us. Buy a beer for Matt Domsch.
Here's the original RHEL bug (do not add silly comments or I'll make
it private):
 
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=165749
Notice that the bug deals with broken sharing between EHCI and its
companion controller. This is also something a BIOS breaks often.
But you should've seen wild theories people posted about it to Ubuntu
forums, they just crack me up.
