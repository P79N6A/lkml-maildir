Note that our (my and Alexander's try) at the utf8 patch only affects 
composing. If you have a "native" umlaut key or whatever, it will work 
without the patch.
I am not sure if you need Adam Tlałka's patch too.
At least you do not need it for composing, and I have not found any 
annoyance in my regular day that would require me to assume another bug
in the utf8 code.
