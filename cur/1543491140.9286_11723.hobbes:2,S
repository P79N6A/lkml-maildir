read the source:
root@chipsworld:~ # head -1 `which mkbootdisk`
#!/bin/bash
looking though it... it checks a couple places for the version you want to
make a boot disk of:
----->8--------
[ -d /lib/modules/$kernel ] || {
    echo "/lib/modules/$kernel is not a directory." >&2
    exit 1
}
[ -f /boot/vmlinuz-$kernel ] || {
    echo "/boot/vmlinuz-$kernel does not exist." >&2
    exit 1
}
-------8<------
I checks for the modules directory for the requested kernel ver, then
checks for /boot/vmlinux-X.X.X
