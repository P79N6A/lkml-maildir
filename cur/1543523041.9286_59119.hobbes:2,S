Hi All,
	Good luck getting Toshiba to update their firmware...
	If you read the SCSI MultiMedia spec, you'll notice 6-byte Read/Write commands
are not mandatory (true for ATAPI & SCSI).  So, I'd say the drivers need to be updated.
	I seem to recall someone was updating drives to switch to 10-byte CDB's?
Regards,
Robin
