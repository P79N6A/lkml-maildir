Here is the main reasons why I have it so only one app can open /dev/fb at
a time. Its called SMP. Consider two apps running at the same time both
with /dev/fb opened. Problem:
1) 
   Both apps mmap the MMIO region. Both program the accel engine at the
same. Hey the card locks up. 
2) 
  DRI and fbdev MMIO region. DRI is using accel engine. Some app running 
from a xterm mmaps MMIO region then uses accel engine. The card locks up.
3)
  Someone runs fbset while the X server is using accel engine via /dev/fb 
or DRI. Card locks up. You should only change the mode when the accel
engine is idle. 
Now do people agree with me that /dev/fb should only be opened once.
