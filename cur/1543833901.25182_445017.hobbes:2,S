1) Because then the behavior of /proc/fs/reiserfs/ would be
inconsistent. Devices that contain slashes end up being one level deeper
than other devices, which is silly and a userspace visible change. Tools
that wish to parse the information would then need added complexity to
traverse into the next level to reach that information.
2) The block-device-as-path-name-component behavior is already defined
by sysfs (/sys/block), and it should be consistent.
