In one post you complain that SG_IO is unneeded on /dev/hd* and related 
devices and in this one you say that it's all that would have been needed to 
fix a bug!
Joerg, I think it's time you stop dodging questions, shifting blame and all 
the tactics you've been using and admit that you just don't like Linux. After 
all, every time you are asked to provide a technical basis for an argument 
you have three main tactics - Dodge it entirely, misquote POSIX or say "But 
Solaris does it this way".
As you well know I've asked you for quality information I could use to try and 
fix the bug in the kernel where it munges the CDB for certain drives and am 
trying to work with you to develop a patch that will let libscg scan both the 
SCSI and ATA/ATAPI bus on Linux. I realize I'm an unknown factor here, since 
I've never found any place where my skills would come in useful on a major 
project like cdrecord or Linux, but now I have.
If you do not want the help just say such. If you just want to complain about 
problems and preach about how great Solaris is, then you are nothing but a 
feigen schweinhund and deserve to receive no more of my time.
(and yes, my German is probably quite bad. It's been a very long time since 
I've used any of it on a regular basis)
