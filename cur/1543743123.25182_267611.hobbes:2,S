Ok, call me stupid, but what's the difference between
	idr_get_new(&mmu_context_idr, NULL, &index);
and
	idr_get_new_above(&mmu_context_idr, NULL, 0, &index);
because as far as I can tell, they are exactly the same.
They both just do a "idr_get_new_above_int(idp, ptr, 0)".
So I don't see why one would need an awkward init function, and the other
wouldn't..
That said, maybe the problem is that we shouldn't even get far enough into 
the fork() logic to ever get into a new MMU context if driver_init ends up 
being called before we're ready.
