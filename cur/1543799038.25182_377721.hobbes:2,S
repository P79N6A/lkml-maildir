Isn't this what dcache_lock doing presently ? As per vanilla 2.6.5 kernel
I don't see how the race condition you mention above can happen.
In prune_dcache(), a dentry is first removed off the dentry_unused list
(under dcache_lock) before calling prune_one_dentry(). So how is it 
possible that an another thread executing prune_dcache() will hit
the same dentry again ?
