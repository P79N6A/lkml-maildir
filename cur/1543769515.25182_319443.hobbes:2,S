Does that mean that the core dump is written 
with the rt prio of the task which dumps?
I'm not sure if this is a good idea: 
Dumping a big core might take *ages* (at least w.r.t. realtime),
especially because it usually goes to flash memory, a CF card,
or some other really slow device.
Doing that on a high rt prio is not nice; in an rt kernel, 
it may even keep interrupt handlers from responding...
Is there any way to do it in the background / at low prio?
