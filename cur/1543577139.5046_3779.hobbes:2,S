Included it in the rc.local file as you told me but it did not
work. I still had to go to "/dir1/drv" and do "su [password for
root]" and then type "./upload",  exit.  Maybe some little script that
can do this in the "bash_profile" or ....
I am not familiar with scripting...
This is a custom driver for a custom board.
