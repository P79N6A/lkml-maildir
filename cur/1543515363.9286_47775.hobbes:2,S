Well, it doesn't.  The various helper programs are already not
self-contained.  They already use /usr/include, /lib/libc.so*, etc.

No, it's very relevant.  The dangling symlinks are broken.  I'll
explain below.  I think, though, that we're going to have to agree to
disagree.

No, I think you're misunderstanding the situation.  split-include.c
does *not* use kernel headers.  Look again:
  #include <sys/stat.h>
  #include <sys/types.h>
  #include <ctype.h>
  #include <errno.h>
  #include <fcntl.h>
  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <stdlib.h>
  #include <string.h>
  #include <unistd.h>
Note the conspicuous lack of any "#include <linux/*.h>" above.
split-include.c is just using regular libc headers.  One of the libc
headers is what is needing <linux/*.h>.  If split-include.c actually
included any kernel headers directly, you might have a point.
In other words, your problem is not specific to split-include.c.  ANY
program that uses the above set of headers will fail to compile.  Which 
makes it a bug in your libc header files.

See, again, split-include.c is not needing actual kernel header files.
It just needs a C API with roughly POSIX features.  The exact version
of kernel headers that your C compiler environment uses should not
matter a bit.

Well, to me it's the principle of the thing -- not only do I believe
that it's not a kernel bug, I also disagree with overloading $(CC) (or
$(HOSTCC)) with what are really CFLAGS.  Makes it hard to substitute
one compiler in for another.  FSF has a policy about this, actually:
their Makefiles are usually written to let you do `make CC=whatever'
and have it just work.  I have a kernel patch out there
(

) to this effect.
