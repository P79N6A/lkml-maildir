Not really - this comes under system tuning -
1) the minimum allocated (initial) swap should be large enough for all the 
   standard utilities. This is limited to around 8-16K. There are others that
   need more (sort). The inital allocation size should be either a per-user
   amount, or a system global (or both).
2) This gives the user the option to request a larger initial stack for
   unusual processes (say GIMP). 
> 3) you can't handle a signal caused by stack exhaustion
True, unless you use a soft limit vs hard limit. The softlimit signal occurs
when the last allocated page of stack is used. This gives the time (and stack)
space to catch the signal and potentially allocate more.

That depends on the level of deadlock - If only user processes deadlock then
the kernel can still report the deadlock (and request an expansion of swap...)
This soft deadlock usually clears itself after several minutes (not always).
If it is a hard deadlock (no possibility of extraction, we assume a hard
deadlock 5-10 minutes after we see a soft deadlock message), the kernel can
still report it, and then use something like the OOM killer.
In both cases, the system has been operated in an overcommited mode.

You don't really need one. The only non-syscall interface is stack allocation.
Three approaches have been outlined, and both are viable, even if #2 requires
some action on the part of the user.

It isn't really all that ad-hock. This has been done in other UNIX versions
and has worked.
One way to get option #3 implemented for all processes is to embed it in
the process initialzation phase (before main() is called). This is the way
it's done in UNICOS.
