For the sharing case, some sort of softirq should be created. That is, when a
hard interrupt is generated and the irq handler is executed, set a flag that at
some other point in time, the irq is delivered to userspace. Like you do with
signals in userspace:
 void sighandler(int s) {
     exit_main_loop_soon = 1;
 }
something similar could be done in kernelspace without interrupting important
devices/irq_handlers sharing the same IRQ.
