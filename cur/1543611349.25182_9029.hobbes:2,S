I have a similar problem with the 686b south bridge. The module loads
fine but no sound comes out. The alsa drivers don't work for this computer
either.
Via 686a audio driver 1.9.1
PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device 00:07.5
IRQ routing conflict for 00:07.5, have irq 5, want irq 11
PCI: Sharing IRQ 11 with 00:0a.0
