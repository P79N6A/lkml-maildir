At some point I had plans to make virt_to_page() etc. faster
by using multiple look up tables that precompute some of the computation
depending on the caller. But it might possibly cause more cache misses
and the function didn't seem that time critical back then.
But if you can really measure it so clearly it might be worth revisiting
that.
