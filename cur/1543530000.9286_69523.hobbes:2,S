I don't think ioctl(2) should be used for regular files.
From man ioctl(2) on Linux.
SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/ioctl.h>
       int ioctl(int d, int request, ...)
	.
	.
	.
ERRORS
       EBADF  d is not a valid descriptor.
       EFAULT argp references an inaccessible memory area.
       ENOTTY d is not associated with a character special device.
