The __crc_... reference is definitely bogus - none should survive with the
new .c->.o rule. Could you find out what object file they originate from?
The others look like a tools side behavioral difference, as I never saw any
such. Is this problem sparc32-specific (I tested x86 and ia64 only)? What's
the binutils version used?
