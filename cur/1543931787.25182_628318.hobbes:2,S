I have no objection against your opinion about massive VFS changes or
existing "lower" filesystems.

I agree that time-based checking is available in many cases.
But there will exist some opeartions which are done in one
second, and it may not be available when a user changes the clock/time
of his system.

Since NFS is a remote filesystem, I don't think it is a good idea to
compare the behaviour of if and a stackable filesystem, since all
lower(branch) filesystems are able to be local filesystems.

Agreed, so the inotify handler should set a flag or atomic_inc/dec
the internal generation, or enqueue such job and handle it
later (shortly). Of course, when the dentry/inode of the stackable
filesystem corresspoding to the modfied file are not cached, the handler
has nothing to do.
Additionally, it is only directories to be set inotify for monitoring,
instead of all files. The inotify handler for a directory receives all
necessary (for a stackable fs) events for its children.

Currently, I don't think sharing page is any kind of
violation. Additionally the dentry of the upper file system does NOT
point to the inode of the lower file system. Of course it can implement
->mmap operation.

Basically, yes.
But there are several things to do such as locking.

I guess probably you forgot some locking.

If you changed some important members of internal structures without
locking, it would be unsafe and violate something.
Finally I think the approach of sharing pages, you may call it
zero-copy conversely your approach, is safe. At least, this approach is
working over a year while several people are using it.
Of course, I never say it is bug-free. There may exist a problem which
simply I don't know yet.
