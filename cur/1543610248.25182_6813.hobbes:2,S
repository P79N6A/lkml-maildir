Appearantly my patch from yesterday was a bit premature...
It looks like the ax25 and netrom stack do some magic with the dead sockets
that is not compatible with sock_orphan. I will try and see if I can track
them down.
The result is that at the moment the only way to make ax25 stable in 2.4.x
is to add the sk->dead check in my first patch.
