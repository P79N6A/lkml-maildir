Yes, I was thinking of something more sophisticated, but this is what we need.

Well, I'm afraid about such filesystems as vfat ...

I meant the filesystems could be marked as "removable" rather than the
devices containing them, so that the users could tell us which filesystems
might need special handling.

Agreed.
