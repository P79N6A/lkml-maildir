Ah. OK. Funnily enough an earlier version did offload to a workqueue but i
thought that was too convoluted. I didn't realise interrupts were disabled
inside the request_fn context.

Well, when the register bit clears they are over, seems to be about 200 -
400 microseconds or there abouts (ie that length of time between the
interrupt signalling that the transfer is over and the bit clearing to
allow a new transfer) - so I could time that out at say HZ/2 and be very
safe.

Afraid not.
