Hello All!
    [ CC me please - I'm not subscribed ]
    I have a question which goes to 2.2 kernels times.
    But I expect newer kernels do the same.
    I have/had a simple issue with multi-threaded programs:
    one thread is doing blocking read(fd) or poll({fd}) on 
    file/socket.
    another thread is doing close(fd).
    I expected first thread will unblock with some kind 
    of error - but nope! It is blocked!
    Is it expected behaviour?
    I was implementing couple of char device 
    drivers and I was putting wake_up_interruptible() 
    into close(). Nice feature - but not more.
    Does it really matters?
    What standards do say about this? - I have none of 
    them :-(   
P. S. Subject looks correct from point of view of bash:
"read() &" and then "close()" does nothing - %1 can only 
be killed ;)
--- Regards&Wishes! With respect
