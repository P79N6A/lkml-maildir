           Summary: cdrom ioctl CDROM_SEND_PACKET broken
    Kernel Version: 2.5.66+
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: bugme-janitors@lists.osdl.org

Problem Description:
  I think i've located the problem with doing generic commands
to atapi drives.
mmc_ioctl calls cdrom_do_cmd with it's own copy of cgc made
from IOCTL_IN
cdrom_do_cmd then does it's thing, and copies back into
the cgc from mmc_ioctl. And then returns, however mmc_ioctl
is returning immediatly w/o updating the user passed in cgc.
The pointers to return to user space never get updated, so if you
set all 1's in a cgc->buffer and send it in you will get all 1's back
as that buffer is not updated correctly. nor is the sense data.
It looks like the copy_to_user needs to move to mmc_ioctl, or mmc_ioctl
needs to update the user cgc correctly.
Steps to reproduce:
Run a small program that calls CDROM_SEND_PACKET, i'll attach one
