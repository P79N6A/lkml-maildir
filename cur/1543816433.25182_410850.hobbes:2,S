I know the guys who wrote FiSC, the tool in question, and I have
even hacked on related software a little bit myself.  I suspect
that, if asked, they would say that the code is rather
embarrassing and that they wouldn't want to release it for that
reason.  However, to my knowledge it wasn't written by or in
conjunction with Coverity, so there wouldn't be any issues of
that kind.
If you want to pursue this, I'd recommend emailing Paul Twohey
<twohey@CS.Stanford.EDU> or Junfeng Yang <yjf@stanford.edu>.  As
I understand it, they are the grad students who spent the most
time working on FiSC and related tools.
