Hello!
I am experiencing hard lockups (no oops, no response to ALT-SYSREQ) on a
dual pentium pro running 2.4.1pre9.  The system has two Promise IDE
controllers installed (PDC20246 and PDC 20262) with a drive hanging off of
each channel.  In addition, the onboard PIIX4 has a single drive hanging off
the first channel.
The hard lockup occurs during heavy IO during a boot-up fsck.  The system is
fscking three of the four Promise channels and the PIIX4 channel
simultaneously.  The system locks up hard after 60-90 seconds of fscking.
Since the system does not respond to ALT-SYSREQ, I have been unable to get
any dumps.  Does anyone have any thoughts on how to proceed?
Best,
