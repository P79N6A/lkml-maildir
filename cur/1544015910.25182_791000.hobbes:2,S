Yes, that seems a bit unsafe to me.  Another solution is to just grab
all the keyboard devices, and reemit the wanted evdev keycodes.  Quite
clumsy.

What do you mean by "this"?  The raw keycode -> input keycode
translation?  My guess is that it is recorded for the device itself, not
related to things like VTs, and thus is global.

Ugh.  I'd prefer grabing evdev rather that using a pty.
