I have to use kernel 2.4.18 because I need to install KURT (realtime
linux) with it. However, my system hangs on boot with the following
message:
PDC20268: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
PDC20268: ROM enabled at 0xff900000
    ide2: BM-DMA at 0xfcc0-0xfcc7, BIOS settings: hde:pio, hdf:pio
    ide3: BM-DMA at 0xfcc8-0xfccf, BIOS settings: hdg:pio, hdh:pio
I have tried tricks I could find in through google, like setting boot
parameters "hde=4866,255,63 hde=noprobe hdg=24321,255,163 hdg=noprobe".
But it didn't work.
Could anybody provide some clue about how to fix this problem? Thanks
very much.
