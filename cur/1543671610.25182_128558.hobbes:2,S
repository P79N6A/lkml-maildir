Can anyone tell me how to absolutely force a reset on a i386?  Specifically, 
is there a system call that will call the assembly instruction to assert the 
RESET bus line? I try to use the "reboot(LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_RESTART,0,0,NULL)" 
call, but it will not always work.  Occassionally, I experience a "missed 
interrupt" on a Promise IDE controller, and while I can telnet into the 
system, I can't reset it.  Any help greatly appreciated!  Since these systems 
are 1000's of miles away, the need to remotely reset it paramont.
