i had this code changed back and forth twice already, because i was unsure
whether it's correct. It's true that it's not an equivalent
transformation, but after some thinking it looked correct to me. Isnt
there a 1:1 relationship between the tty and the session ID in this case?
Ie. the previous code was pessimistic and just scanned for matching
p->tty's outside of the tty->session == p->session space, but it should
not have done so.
i'll add some debugging code to the old code to print out cases when
p->tty == tty but p->session != tty->session and start up X, that should
prove or disprove this theory, right?
(i cant remember any other place where the code transformation was not
identity, but will double-check this again.)
William, you did the original transformation, was this optimization done
intentionally?
