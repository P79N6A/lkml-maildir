While I haven't tested recent SD versions, unless it's design has
radically changed recently, I know what to expect.  CFS is giving me a
very high quality experience already (it's at a whopping v7), while
RSDL/SD irritated me greatly at version v40.  As far as I'm concerned,
CFS is the superior target, short-term, long-term whatever-term.  For
the tree where I make the decisions, the hammer has fallen, and RSDL/SD
is history.  Heck, I'm _almost_ ready to rm -rf my own scheduler trees
as well... I could really use some free disk space.
