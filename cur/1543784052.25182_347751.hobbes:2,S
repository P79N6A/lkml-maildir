The more I think about this the more it becomes clear that this path
will be too winding, especially when compared to the effort needed to
patch 8K (or more) back into the kernel as an intermediate workaround.
Moving the Windows code out of the kernel to userspace should be more
helpful on the long term. It would take a small stub, something like
tun/tap devices with wireless extensions, plus something to forward
PCI interrupts, and you could start hacking the wrapper in a save
harbour. If libusb is already prepared for such a task is not yet
clear to me (at least it is lacking USB 2.0 according to the docs).
But time will likely solve this as well.
