Subject: can a kmalloc be both GFP_ATOMIC and GFP_KERNEL at the same
time?
  i'd always assumed that the type flags of GFP_ATOMIC and GFP_KERNEL
were mutually exclusive when it came to calling kmalloc(), at least
based on everything i'd read.  so i'm not sure how to interpret the
following:
drivers/scsi/aic7xxx_old.c:  aic_dev = kmalloc(sizeof(struct aic_dev_data), GFP_ATOMIC | GFP_KERNEL);
drivers/message/i2o/device.c:   resblk = kmalloc(buflen + 8, GFP_KERNEL | GFP_ATOMIC);
  clarification?
