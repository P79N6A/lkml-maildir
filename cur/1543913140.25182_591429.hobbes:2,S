Subject: Race condition: calling remove_proc_entry in cleanup_module (module_exit) while someone's using procfile

Hi!
There is a race condition if an instance is executing "__exit
device_exit" and calls remove_proc_entry, while someone is still using
the procfile, right?.
static void __exit device_exit(void)
{
  // what if the procfile is still in use?
  remove_proc_entry(PROC_FILE_NAME, &proc_root);
}
To remove this race condition, the code in "__exit device_exit" must
a) be sure that no other instance is in procfile functions
b) call remove_proc_entry before any other instance accesses the procfile
*** Is this at all possible if a race-condition is to be avoided?
If yes: which mechanism can be used?
Thanks -Albert
