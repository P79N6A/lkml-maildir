No, and I really don't want to hear how dbench is a terrible benchmark. 
I didn't craft the patch around dbench and I think, here at least,
dbench is an OK benchmark.  I ran it numerous times over multiple client
loads.
I think its clear there won't be a negative impact, because:
- acquiring the inode semaphore isn't any heavier (in the acquire
  case) than the BKL
- the lock contention on each inode semaphore is relatively
  zero
- besides just scaling badly with the using a global lock against
  all inodes, we use the BKL which in such workloads is already
  highly contested.
That said, I did do some lock profiling and latency tests.  Contention
was near-zero, but I only did 2-way testing.  Under the preemptible
kernel, while running dbench, scheduling latency improved 8.9%.
