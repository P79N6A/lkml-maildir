Hi,
I am not a member of either of these lists and would appreciate if you could send your replies to me personally.
Now the problem:
I have an IBM Netfinity X330 server. Dual Processor (PIII 800). I compiled kernel 2.2.14 with SMP support. NFS was however compiled as a module. 
Now the problem is as follows:
Most of the times the machine just works fine. 
But whenever there is heavy disk write activity it just hangs/crashes. Also this is when the SMP kernel is used. If I use the normal kernel then there is no problem. 
Could any one tell me what has to be done to prevent this from happening? 
Any help in this regard will be very much appreciated.
Once again, kindly reply to me personally as I am not a member of either of these lists.
Regards
Dhar
