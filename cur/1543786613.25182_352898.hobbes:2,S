I think most of the complication is because of the different needs of
various architectures. But if you think the structure can be cut down
further, that would be good to consider.

I think with dyn-tick, next_timer_event is replaced by 
dyn_tick_reprogram_timer().  We should also add add_timer_on() to the
list.
