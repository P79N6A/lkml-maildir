I tend to agree with some important notes:
1. IET should be excluded from this list, iSCSI-SCST is IET updated for 
SCST framework with a lot of bugfixes and improvements.
2. I think, everybody will agree that Linux iSCSI target should work 
over some standard SCSI target framework. Hence the choice gets 
narrower: SCST vs STGT. I don't think there's a way for a dedicated 
iSCSI target (i.e. PyX/LIO) in the mainline, because of a lot of code 
duplication. Nicholas could decide to move to either existing framework 
(although, frankly, I don't think there's a possibility for in-kernel 
iSCSI target and user space SCSI target framework) and if he decide to 
go with SCST, I'll be glad to offer my help and support and wouldn't 
care if LIO-SCST eventually replaced iSCSI-SCST. The better one should win.
