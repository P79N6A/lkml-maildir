Side note - I'm attaching another (incomplete) patch for ptrace.2 with some 
addition - there is already something worth adding, though I only listed the 
2.6-only ptrace options since I don't know what they do.

I must indeed check the detail but I'm almost totally sure that this point is 
totally wrong; conceptually, I understand what you mean, 
but mixing PTRACE_SYSEMU and PTRACE_SYSCALL has non-obvious results.
Indeed, whether a syscall is performed or skipped is decided by the call which 
stops at syscall entry, not by the call which resumes the syscall.
Actually, choosing what to do at resume time would make more sense, but for 
historical reasons this was overlooked (also see at the end of this email).
I've described the exact semantics below, however I feel that mixing the calls 
does not make any sense - we implemented this support mainly for testing - on 
2.4 hosts we could test UML performance this way, on 2.6 we couldn't and then 
"fixed" the API to be again this strange one.
The exact semantics are these:
remember that PTRACE_SYSEMU is called once per syscall; you attach the 
process, do a PTRACE_SYSEMU on it, and it'll stop at syscall #1 entry, and 
this syscall will not be executed; you look at calls param, perform what you 
want to do, and then resume it.
If you resume it with PTRACE_SYSEMU, it'll stop at next syscall entry, as 
expected, and next syscall will not be executed.
If you resume it with PTRACE_SYSCALL (which made sense only for debugging), 
the only thing which changes is that _next_ syscall will be executed 
normally; then after stopping at syscall #2 exit you can choose to resume 
with PTRACE_SYSEMU. You can do that even at syscall #2 entry, but you get the 
same result.

This is true.
However, I remember I answered to your request to fix this problem with some 
patches to test (I remember I was sure enough of their correctness, for what 
can be seen by code inspection), but got no answer and didn't finish 
anything. Lost the email or the interest?
I was also busy so I didn't test them myself (even because reading this code 
and following the exact states causes me a headache).
