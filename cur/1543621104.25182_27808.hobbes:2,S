I think that's just stupid and we have a duty to fix it, it's an anachronism.
The _natural_ expectation for the user is that sync means 'don't come back
until data is on disk' and any other interpretation is just apologizing for
halfway implementations.
Sync should mean: come back after all filesystem transactions submitted before
the sync are recorded, such that if the contents of RAM vanishes the data can
still be retrieved.
For dumb filesystems, this can degenerate to 'just try to write all the dirty
blocks', the traditional Linux interpretation, but for journalling filesystems
we can do the job properly.

Yes, right.

How about adding: sync --old-broken-way
On this topic, it would make a lot of sense from the user's point of view to
have a way of syncing a single volume, how would we express that?
