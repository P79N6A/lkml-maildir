Adding a jumper won't go over well due to the trivial cost,
but that doesn't mean we should have to tolerate hardware that
accepts self-destruct commands.
The answer is simple: the drive contains the vendors public key,
and the drive refuses firmware updates that are not signed.
Well duh. Andre, how about pushing for this at the next standards
meeting? The extra safety would do us all some good, including
the Linux-2.0.36 and non-Linux users.
Might as well push for a standard firmware update command too.
(guessing from your posts, this is currently vendor-specific)
