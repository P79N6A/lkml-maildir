No, its just left overs from my playing with a Promise Ultra/66 card.  Even without the raid and ide patches, i can use DMA

Opposite side of the spectrum from the utter crap this DataExpert is. =)  Had to get a modified bios, to get a 13.6 gig to exist in the machine without locking it up
on the POST.  Yes, you can tell it no bios, but without the ide patches, it's _very_ slow.
> What version of hdparm are you using? By the output it looks like 3.9, patched? Did DMA work from the very beginning? Can you send me a copy of your .config file?
standard hdparm 3.9, from debian woody.  The difference is i used -i, instead of -I, i think.  I'll see how mangled my .config is.
Looks somewhat clean, a few modules i don't use.  I'll send it in a seperate email.
I've got maybe 3 or 4 of these machines in service as backup servers for small lans.  Small 1.6 gig boot drive, 13.6 gig data drive, a cdrom, and a IDE 7/14 gig HP
tape drive.  Speeds aren't too bad, and DMA seems to work on the parts that support it.
