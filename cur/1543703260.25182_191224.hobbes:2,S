Hi!
I have a problem with EISA Smart2/E raid controller on an old Compaq 
Proliant 1000 server. With 2.4.18 everything works fine, but with 2.4.22 
or newer kernel the board is not recognized. The driver is compiled into 
the kernel, not as a module, configuration is the same.
Are there any know issues with EISA boards and newer kernels???
Thanks
Sasa
