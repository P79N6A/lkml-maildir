Hallo Andrew,
I didn't even noticed, because I had no time to test ;o)
But thnks anyway. Maybe - for testing only - one could insert
a BUG() if the cached amount gets negative to get a call trace ?
My expirience in kernel hacking is rather limited.
I just wanted to report it anyway, because I thought it got fixed.
Have a nice Monday,
(at least I hope I will),
Patrick
