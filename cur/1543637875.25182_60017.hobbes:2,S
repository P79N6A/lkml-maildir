Well, one would want to keep the WANT_PAGE_VIRTUAL thing anyway.
btw, the usage of page_address() will quite possibly drop sharply soon
anyway.  There's the patch floating about which permits atomic
kmaps to be held across copy_*_user.  If that is adopted, things
like the pagecache IO routines won't do page_address() any more.
Said patch speeds up pagecache IO by between 0% and probably 30%.
It's the mystery surrounding this variation which is holding things
up.
