There are several problems I've seen with recent kernels' CD access:
You can mount CD in the same directory multiple times, which gets hairy
when
there in daemons (gnomish things) mounting them in the background as
well.
Door locking is broken, so you can eject a CD which is still mounted.
I've also had the CD drivers randomly returning the first session of a
disk - on
the Redhat Pinstripe CD for example (which has a bunch of boot images on
its first
session).
