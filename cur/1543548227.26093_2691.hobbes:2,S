In input path you have a packet. Add it to backlog and processing
will be resumed after lock is released. Compare with tcp.

Being legal in principle, using non-standard serialization primitives
is seriously deprecated. It is impossible to maintain. In you case,
it is even not evident that it does not lose events with smp.

Why? It is not required. There are no reasons to protect protocol
as whole, if sockets are protected.

Yes.

And check for sk->lock.users. If it is not zero, operation is deferred.

Yes.

Yes. And finally announce protocol to be SMP aware setting data
field of packet_type to 1.

It cannot be preempted, but it is not very essential, because
all they can run in parallel on different cpus.
