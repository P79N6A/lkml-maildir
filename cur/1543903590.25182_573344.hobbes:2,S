Ok, I did misunderstand you. it sound slike all you need to do to make 
sure that locks are not held is to allow system calls to return before 
trying to do the suspend/kexec/etc. that sounds like not only a trivial 
thing to do, but something that would probably be done anyway.
although syscalls that then call out to userspace tasks before they can 
complete cause potential deadlocks (without that issue you can just wait 
until all syscalls have returned, and not allow anything to issue new 
syscalls) is this the issue that's killing FUSE+suspend?

here is where you loose me.
why should jumping back to the original kernel immedialty start running 
these processes? the process of doing a kexec requires things to happen in 
the drivers before normal activity can happen, so there is a phase in 
there where the kernel being jumped to has drivers initializing, but still 
does not allow anything else to run. why can't this phase be extended to 
allow for the possibility of transitioning these drivers to a sleep mode 
instead of to full operation?

yes, if userspace is running jobs and submitting I/O and system calls 
while drivers are trying to initalize there is a big problem, but I am 
missing the reason this must be the case.

the part of the freezer that everyone is trying to eliminate is the 
exceptions (freeze everything except X,Y,Z becouse we will need to use 
those later for A)

a better way of phrasing what I meant goes more along the lines of 'the

very possibly. there are so many different sub-threads that part of my

the thread

this was in reaction to reading the power/devices.txt. my first thought 
was along the lines of "no wonder device driver authors don't implement 
all this, it's obviously evolved from the needs of the people doing the 
suspend, one call at a time" and from there I started thinking about what 
would make sense to driver authors and provide the capability that's 
needed for the job. I broke that off into a seperate thread anyway.
