Perhaps all architectures "should", but I can assure
you that many of them do no such thing. I didn't
look at every current architecture, but some notable
ones like the brand new IA64, as well as some older
chips such as MIPS have some relatively complicated
code in get_unaligned(), which can be found in the
appropriate include/asm-<arch> directory in the
file unaligned.h. I suspect that at least some of
these allow for an exception handler to fake the
capability in user space programs, but that isn't
something you can allow inside the kernel.
