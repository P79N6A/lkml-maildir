The kernel pm code assumes there is a single agent issuing power management
requests via pm_* calls. User space is a different matter. There are numerous
good arguments for multiple policy agents, be they multiple applications or
multiple state machines in one system. Most power management seems to best
be modelled by multiple very simple algorithms running in parallel.

I would tend to agree here. If you want to wire it to init the fine but 
pm is basically message passing kernel->user and possibly message reply to
allow veto/approve. APM provides a good API for this and there is a definite
incentive to make ACPI use the same messages, behaviour and extend it.
