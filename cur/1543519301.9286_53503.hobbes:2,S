Ok. Most "strong" symmetric (we need symmetric crypto for swap!) cryptgraphic
algorithms have the same memory usage: some structure (not very big) is
allocated on initialization but NO allocations are needed in crypto process
itself. IMO much bigger problem is speed. Blowfish will give you 4MiB/sec
with 100% processor usage on Pentium200MMX and blowfish is pretty fast (but of
course not fastest available) algorithm. If you need real security it can be
tolerable though...

Why it's so problematic ?
