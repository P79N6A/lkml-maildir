Both patches (MV & Ingos) have their good bits, but both share the same
ugliness and are hard to compare and harder to combine. The conversion
of spin_lock to _spin_lock and substitution of spin_lock by mutexes,
semaphores or what ever makes it more than hard to keep the code in a
readable form.
If there is the tendency to touch the concurrency controls in general
all over the kernel, then I would suggest a script driven overhaul of
all concurrency controls like spin_locks, mutexes and semaphores to
general macros like 
enter_critical_section(TYPE, &var, &flags, whatever);
leave_critical_section(TYPE, &var, flags, whatever);
where TYPE might be SPIN_LOCK, SPIN_LOCK_IRQ, MUTEX, PMUTEX or whatever
we have and come up with in the future.
This could be done in a first step and then it is clearly identifiable
and it gives us more flexibility to wrap different implementations and
lets us change particular points in a more clear way.
I would be willing to provide some scripted conversion aid, if there is
enough interest to that. I started with some test files and the results
are quite encouraging.
Any thoughts ?
