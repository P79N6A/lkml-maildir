Typical != always.  It may be more common for suspend to maintain usb 
power, but both suspend and hibernate may or may not maintain usb power, 
so the kernel needs to be prepared to deal with that in both cases.

And this is exactly how non USB hardware has behaved for eons, and it 
hasn't been a problem.  If you want to add some verification to make 
reasonably sure that the media has not been modified, that is great, but 
you can't just automatically dump the filesystem and kill running 
processes and loose data just because something bad _may_ have happened.

Again, the hardware is perfectly free to power off the usb bus during 
suspend to ram.  Most systems choose not to because they allow wake from 
usb, but not all do.

Left field is where flames are, which is what the comment was that I was 
replying to -- a flame.
