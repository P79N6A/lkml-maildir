Is it essential that the smaller systems (ie. palm tops, perhaps even the
"home" user) utilize a journalling filesystem?  Sure, they could take
advantage of the benefits, but is the additional use of resources worth
it?  Although it'd add to the confusion, perhaps having two filesystem
choices wouldn't be an overly bad idea?
Mike.
