Not that I disagre with utilising the PAT, but I don't see anything in this code to
deal with the widespread PAT indexing erratum in Intel's processors. I don't have
the errata sheets here, but it definitely affected the PIIIs and I think also some P4s.
(Large pages ignoring PAT index bit 2, or something like that.)
