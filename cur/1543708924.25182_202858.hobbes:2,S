Personalities work fine for that kind of thing.  The few buggy
apps that can't deal with addresses >3GB (IIRC the JVM in the
Oracle installer) get their stack at 3GB, the others get their
stack at 4GB.

The different setups should definately be benchmarked.  I know
we expected the 4:4 kernel to be slower at everything, but the
folks at Oracle actually ran into a few situations where the 4:4
kernel was _faster_ than a 3:1 kernel.
Definately not what we expected, but a nice surprise nontheless.

All you need to do for that is to copy some code from RHEL3 ;)

Alternatively, you start the mmap at "stack start - stack ulimit" and
grow it down from there. That still gives you 3.8GB of usable address
space on x86, with the 4:4 split. ;)
cheers,
