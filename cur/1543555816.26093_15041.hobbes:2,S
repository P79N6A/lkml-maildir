Well Keith, I will never fail to post back changes to you, as evidenced
by the fact I did send you one.  Anconda is open sourced, and as such,
is no longer owned by any distributor.  The question is whether to 
diverge it from theirs.  I would like to not do this, since, as you
point out, it generates changes back the other way.   
It's your call.  I can keep the patch around because I really don't 
want to diverge anaconda any more than I have to.  At some point,
perhaps they will get changes to you more timely.  
:-)
Jeff
