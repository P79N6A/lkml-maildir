I want to use these macros for calls to vmcoreinfo_append_str(), because
the strings included in each macro ("SIZE(XXX)=", "OFFSET(XXX)=", etc.)
are very important. makedumpfile command reads these strings and gets the
debugging information (structure sizes, field offsets, etc.). If losing
these macros and there is a typo like "OFESET(page.mapping)=", the command
cannot run. To prevent this mistake, these macros are very useful.
For more readability, I think it is good that all the calls are changed
to macros having a prefix "VMCOREINFO_" like the attached patch.
Thanks
