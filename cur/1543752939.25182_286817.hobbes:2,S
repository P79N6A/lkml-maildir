Well, architectures which support CPU hotplug have had to fix their boot
process anyway, and most are fairly trivial.

Ick, see patch.

Linus would not have taken the patch, because it would have broken too
much.  Cleaning up the x86 boot sequence is a project in itself, which
needs to be done, but not by me 8)

Name: Fix x86 calling timers before CPU is supposed to be up
Status: Untested
Signed-off-by: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
>From Andi Kleen:
	The per CPU timers would only get initialized after an secondary
	CPU was running. But during initialization the secondary CPU would
	already enable interrupts to compute the jiffies. When a per 
	CPU timer fired in this window it would run into a BUG in timer.c
	because the timer heap for that CPU wasn't fully initialized.
	The race only happens when a CPU takes a long time to boot
	(e.g. very slow console output with debugging enabled).
The reason is that the x86 boot code actually bring up all CPUs
immediately, then simply unleashes them when the core code calls
__cpu_up().  Unfortunately, they enable interrupts to call
calibrate_delay(): if they get a timer interrupt during that, they
call into the core timer code which isn't set up for it yet.
