	So?

	It should relinquish the processor it is running on until it again becomes 
the head of its thread list. (IE, for as long as it takes the scheduler to 
decide that it's the thread to run.)

	I have sympathy for those who use it properly, I have no sympathy for those 
who loop on sched_yield burning the CPU and then complaining that it burns 
CPU.
