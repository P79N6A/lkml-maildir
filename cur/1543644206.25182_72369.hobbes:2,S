We definitely don't want to make it harder, for users or developers. We're 
actually trying to make it easier for both, even though it may not be 
apparent right now. 
Converting code to the driver model means we get to consolidate a lot of 
similar yet disparate interfaces and code, which most people seem to 
favor. 
As far as userspace goes, there are tools being developed to extract 
data from driverfs, to give users easy access to device and driver 
attributes; the stuff that was encoded in various proc files. With these 
tools, $user should be able to extract $data for $developer WRT $object. 
And, they should work identically for any instance of an object type 
that's encoded in driverfs: all devices or all bus types or all class 
types, etc, will behave identicaly and give similar data. 
For example, to extract the data you mention above, it would be something 
like: 
	$ lsbus usb devices > usb.info
	$ lsbus usb drivers >> usb.info
No, they're not done, and so I'm all talk about at this point. But, this 
has been the plan all along..
