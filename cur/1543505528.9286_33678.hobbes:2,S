Hi;
You also need to configure in the kernel config, in Network
Device Support, after you select for PPP, the PPP support
for async serial ports, and the appropriate compression
methods if you want.  The new PPP code separates those out
as separate options that can be compiled as separate modules.
If you're configuring these as modules, you'll want to add in
/etc/conf.modules aliases for them:
alias   tty-ldisc-3     ppp_async
alias   char-major-108  ppp_generic
On top of that, in addition to compiling the new pppd-pre-2.3.9,
to go with the new kernel PPP code, don't forget to add a new
device into /dev
mknod /dev/ppp c 108 0

i agree.  i don't know how to do async multilink with this new
code, if it's possible at this point, now that i can't get
the EQL device to work with the PPP connections.
