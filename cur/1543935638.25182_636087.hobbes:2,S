Yes, that patch also evokes a const warning.  Fixed below.  I assume you've
queued these because you're thinking of applying them before 2.6.24?  I'd say
only modules-de-mutex-more-symbol-lookup-paths-in-the-module-code.patch
warrants that (the other is unlikely and not a regression).

Or better, rework all the name lookup interfaces, rather than having: 
struct module *module_text_address(unsigned long addr);
struct module *__module_text_address(unsigned long addr);
int is_module_address(unsigned long addr);
int module_get_kallsym(unsigned int symnum, unsigned long *value, char *type,
			char *name, char *module_name, int *exported);
char *module_address_lookup(unsigned long addr,
			    unsigned long *symbolsize,
			    unsigned long *offset,
			    char **modname,
			    char *namebuf);
int lookup_module_symbol_name(unsigned long addr, char *symname);
int lookup_module_symbol_attrs(unsigned long addr, unsigned long *size,
			       unsigned long *offset, char *modname, char *name);
unsigned long module_kallsyms_lookup_name(const char *name);
unsigned long kallsyms_lookup_name(const char *name);
extern int kallsyms_lookup_size_offset(unsigned long addr,
				  unsigned long *symbolsize,
				  unsigned long *offset);
const char *kallsyms_lookup(unsigned long addr,
			    unsigned long *symbolsize,
			    unsigned long *offset,
			    char **modname, char *namebuf);
extern int sprint_symbol(char *buffer, unsigned long address);
extern void __print_symbol(const char *fmt, unsigned long address);
int lookup_symbol_name(unsigned long addr, char *symname);
int lookup_symbol_attrs(unsigned long addr, unsigned long *size,
		        unsigned long *offset, char *modname, char *name);
Cheers,
Rusty.
