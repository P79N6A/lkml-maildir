what I am trying to do is this. I have a genuine network, say 1.1.1.x, and
my Linux host is on it, as 1.1.1.252 (eth0). I also have a second network at
the back of the Linux box, 192.168.200.x, and a web server on that network,
192.168.200.2. The Linux address is 192.168.200.1 on eth1. 
What I want to do is make the web server appear on the 1.1.1.x network as
1.1.1.160. I have done this before with Firewall-1 on NT, by putting an arp
entry for 1.1.1.160 to point to the Linux machine eth0. The packets get
redirected into the Linux machine, then translated, and then routed out of
eth1. 
The benefit is that there is no routing change to the 1.1.1.x network, and
the Linux box isn't even seen as a router. 
I would appreciate any help with this. Any command to do this?
