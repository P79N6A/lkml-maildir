Hi,
I have a question about the parameter of VIDIOC_G_INPUT and VIDIOC_S_INPUT
parameters in v4l2 specification.
The "Video for Linux Two API Specification" text says that the
parameter of VIDIOC_G_INPUT and VIDIOC_S_INPUT is ...
> [...] a pointer to an integer where the driver stores the number

In the v4l2_input structure the index has the type of __u32.
In contrast, in <linux/videodev2.h> (as of 2.6.27) the ioctls are defined
as follows:
> #define VIDIOC_G_INPUT		_IOR('V', 38, int)
> #define VIDIOC_S_INPUT		_IOWR('V', 39, int)
The problem is that '__u32' is unsigned and 'int' is signed. Furthermore
one cannot be sure that sizeof(__u32) == sizeof(int) on all platforms.
I guess that the parameter of VIDIOC_G_INPUT and VIDIOC_S_INPUT should be
a pointer to __u32. What do you think?
