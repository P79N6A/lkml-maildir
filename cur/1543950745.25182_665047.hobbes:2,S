I don't see the LSM patch in that posting, only a Makefile change that
adds it to the build.

Why?  What is the difference?  I don't see that discussion anywhere in
that post.
Why add add-hock security stuff to the kernel all over the place and not
use the LSM interface that we already have?  If LSM doesn't provide the
exact right hooks needed, we can always change it (and no, we should not
be adding kobj_maps hooks to LSM).
