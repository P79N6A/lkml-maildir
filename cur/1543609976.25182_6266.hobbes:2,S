Hi all,
I have a Thinkpad 600X with IBM 16/4 Token-Ring Card Bus adapter and I 
compiled the kernel 2.4.14 (Mandrake 7.2) BM using the configuration 
file attached to this mail.
The module used is ibmtr_cs.
The problem occur when I try to bring up the tr0 interface and the 
following message appear:
               delaying tr0 initialization [FAILED]
Using the command
               ifconfig tr0 up
this other message appear
               tr0: unknown interface: no such device
any suggestion are welcomed.
