Andrew, I think we should try again to push
pnpacpi-reject-acpi_producer-resources.patch to the mainline.
Pierre's report (starts here: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/5/20
)
is another instance of 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6292.
I suspect that many PNP devices are broken in 2.6.17 because of
this problem.  Probably the only reason we haven't seen more
reports is that PNPACPI isn't turned on by default.  (Maybe
we should do that in -mm?)
You recently proposed pushing it:

Len initially nacked it, but I think the outcome of the discussion
is that Shaohua doesn't object to this patch.  He probably would
still like to blacklist PNP0A03, but that's an additional step we
don't have to take at the same time.
