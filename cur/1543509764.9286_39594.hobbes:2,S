It still doesn't make much sense. Like most good real time problems, the way to
solve it is to turn it into a non-real time problem. If the DSP doesn't time stamp
the events it outputs, get the interrupt routine to do so. I doubt there are FIFOs
on these cards, so the interrupt routine's time stamp must be rather better than
is needed. The user space code can then deal with the event stream in a more
leisurely way.
