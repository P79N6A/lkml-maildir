Vaguely. But that sits on the input side, does edit/interrupt
handling and the like, and isn't stackable. (It would be nice
if you could push a keyboard mapping layer on _any_ tty device).
  We would want something similar that sat on the output side
and changed some output sequences into operations on the console
display itself.
  Of course, you could do much of this as a user program that used
a pty and wrote directly to /dev/vcsa? devices. Then the kernel
side could be _really_ light :-).
