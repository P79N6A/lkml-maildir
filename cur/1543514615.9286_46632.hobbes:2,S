     I don't know if this is related or not, under 2.2.10, I had no problems
with nfsd dying.  Under 2.2.13, if I export a file system read only and try to
mount it read/write on a remote system, that kills it instantly, but even in
the absence of stupid operator tricks, it still dies after a while.  This is
happening on a Sparc LX, not even an SMP environment.  I've also got 2.2.13
running on a Pentium based system and it has been rock steady.  No nfsd deaths
to date.  The strange thing is there is no OOPS or other indication when it
dies, it just disappears silently. 
     I don't have the newest libs on this machine and I did kick the maximum
file descriptors up with 2.2.13, so don't know if that might be tickling some
bug in old libs.
