Well I would be very interested in actually being able to use this  
feature under SELinux, I think that just the underlying "can-I-use- 
this-page" logic needs modification.  Maybe "MAP_REUSABLE"?  That  
would both imply that we can accept reused (IE: nonzeroed) memory  
*AND* that the current page may be reused (IE: remapped without  
zeroing), although you could conceivably have one flag for each  
case.  The userspace allocator should be able to (when prompted by  
MAP_REUSABLE) look in a page "pool" of sorts before falling back to a  
zeroed page.  The pool would be created for a given "key" the first  
time it unmaps MAP_REUSABLE pages, possibly using the memory freed by  
said unmap.
The real trick is how to define the "key".  The default, without  
LSMs, should be something like the UID.  SELinux, on the other hand,  
would probably want to use some kind of hash of the label as the  
"key", (and store the label in each pool, as well).  That way SELinux  
could have a simple access-vector check for process:reusepage, as  
well as an access-vector check and type transition for  
"freereusablepage".  Then a policy could allow most user processes to  
unconditionally reuse pages (which would end up in the access-vector- 
cache and therefore be fast), while security-sensitive processes like  
ssh-agent could neither reuse pages nor have their pages reused, even  
if they request it.
Cheers,
