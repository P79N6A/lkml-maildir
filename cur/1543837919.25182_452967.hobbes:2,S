Yep, I build both of them in.  Making them both modular will require a
wee bit more time, as the aic7xxx has my root disk on it, and I don't
have any initrds.
In any case, I'm starting to get some funky results.  I can't get the
problem to reappear in the tree where I was doing the bisect, but my
development tree where I first saw it is still broken.
I'll do some more digging and get out a more reliable bug report.
