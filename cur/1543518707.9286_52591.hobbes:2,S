I said that netscape -remote commands was one of the potential uses of this
keyboard.  Currently, my keyboard is controlling my CD player.
(back) == track backwards
(forward) == track forward
(stop) == stop playing
(refresh) == play/pause
and the scroll up/down key controls the volume level.
This is obviously a desireable feature to have available at the console level,
and this is not "reinventing the kernel"... It is a 5-line patch to one file.
