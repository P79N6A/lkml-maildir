The "active" pages in your inactive daemons are probably the glibc 
pages, which are generally in use by other applications.  It should 
not have any real effect on the system - in fact, keeping glibc in 
memory is probably a Good Thing, and may be partially responsible for 
your improvement in performance.
AFAICT, 'pinning' active pages in memory is a good thing, provided 
they are deactivated appropriately after a period of disuse.  This 
appears to be the case in current kernels and the new VM, so you're 
good to go in my view.
