I'm not disagreeing with Larry here.  I'm just pointing out that mainline
Linux cares about what is commodity.  That's 1-2 processors and 2-4 on
some PPC and other boards.
I'm keenly interested in 1k processors, as is Larry,  and scaling Linux up
to them.  I'm don't disagree with Linus' path for Linux staying on SMP for
now.  Scaling up to huge clusters isn't a mainline Linux concern.  It's a
very interesting research area, though.  In fact, some research I work on.
