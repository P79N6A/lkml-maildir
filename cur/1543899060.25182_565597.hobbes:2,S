We agreed a while back that you don't need the freezer for suspend to ram. As 
far as I was aware, we went off-topic, so the topic is out of date.

For suspending, yes. For hibernating, that's not enough, because other 
processes can still be happily allocating and freeing memory, and will only 
get stopped when they try to do i/o or such like. If you're trying to make 
hibernation reliable, you need to be able to reliably check whether you're 
going to have enough storage for the image you're preparing, and enough 
memory for the atomic copy and so on. That's why the freezer is needed for 
hibernation. If you don't have it, any hibernation implementation you make is 
going to be only as reliable as the extent to which the system is otherwise 
idle.

Fully agree when it comes to suspend to ram. There, this process should work, 
so far as I can see. But as I said, we went - to one degree or another - off 
topic, and did discuss hibernation too.
