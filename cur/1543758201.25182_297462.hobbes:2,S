Here are some codes from do_exit() starting line 813 (based on
2.6.11-rc4-mm1):
813        acct_update_integrals(tsk);
814        update_mem_hiwater(tsk);
815        group_dead = atomic_dec_and_test(&tsk->signal->live);
816        if (group_dead) {
817                del_timer_sync(&tsk->signal->real_timer);
818                acct_process(code);
819        }
820        exit_mm(tsk);
The acct_process() is called to save off BSD accounting data at
line 818. The next statement at 820, tsk->mm is disposed and all
data saved at tsk->mm is gone, including memory hiwater marks
information saved at line 814. The complete tsk is disposed
before exit of do_exit() routine.
In separate emails discussion thread among interested parties,
i asked Guillaume to clarify this question. I suspect ELSA counts
on BSD's acct_process() at line 818 to save most accounting data.
If that is the case and since ELSA wants extended accounting data
collection, a way to save the extended acct data would be essential
to ELSA as well.
I can better asnwer your "why ELSA can do but CSA can't" question
after i learn more from Guilluame.
Later,
