I patched my 2.2.13 kernel with 2.2.12-ikd7.bz2 and fixed the
rejects, then I applied the lowlatency-2.2.13-A1 patch and fixed
the rejects.  All this works fine in my new kernel.  
I set up a latency test program using the rtc device to interrupt at 64Hz.
I am using the ktrace utility to examine the /proc/trace info after
the latency test program releases a lock indicating a scheduling latency
exceeding 5msec.  I see a problem which appears to be unrelated to the
console driver.  When the "rtc_interrupt" occurs between the "schedule"
and the "__switch_to" (apparently just prior to __switch_to) another pid
is switched in and even though there are many "system_call"s the
test program is held off ~5msec.  Any ideas?
I think the lowlatency patch is a very useful and important enhancement
to the kernel, will it become part of the mainstream kernel source (2.4.x)?
