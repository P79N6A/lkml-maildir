The simplicity is much reduced if each class of devices needs to have
its own method of determining activity. And if you don't find a good way
for some devices, users with these are out in the rain and can do nothing
about it if suspension cannot be triggered from user space.

I've never said that autosuspend is a bad idea. For many devices it is
simple and painless. But it is insufficient. Therefore I think removing
the ability to explicitely request a suspension from user space is wrong.

If so many people cannot come up with a good design, doesn't that indicate
there's no single method that satisfies all needs?
