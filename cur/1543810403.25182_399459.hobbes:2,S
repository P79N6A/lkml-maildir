agree.

Because it protects only compatibility translation. We spend a lot of time in 
these cycles and I don't think that it is a good way to hold ipt_mutex for 
this. The only reason of this lock is offset list - in the first iteration I 
fill it, in the second - use it. If you know how to implement this better, 
let me know.

ughh...
I don't like this code as well. But seems that it is due to iptables code 
itself, which was designed with no thoughts about compatibility in minds.
So, I see following approaches:
1) do translation before pass data to original do_replace or get_entries.
Disadvantage of such approach is additional 2 cycles through data.
2) do translation in compat_do_replace and compat_get_entries. Avoidance of 
additional cycles, but some code duplication.
3) remove alignment checks in kernel - than we need only first time 
translation from kernel to user. But such code will not work with both 32bit 
and 64 bit iptables at the same time.
Any suggestions?
