I think, you should use it on a device, which really exist in the system 
at the moment. If yoy have /dev/hda - use it.
I use a simillar program:
main() {
int par[3] = {0x170, 0x376, 15};
int fd = open("/dev/hda",0);
ioctl(fd, HDIO_SCAN_HWIF, (long)par);
}
It works, however, after use it system sometimes became unstable ...
