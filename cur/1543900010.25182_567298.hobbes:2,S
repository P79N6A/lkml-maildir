BZZT, wrong.  repz cmpsb is memcmp(), not strcmp().  The reason is
simply that memset and memcpy are in assembly is that they are simple
wrappers around string instructions, plus the need to provide the
other-segment copy functions -- it was cleaner to do them as an assembly
file.
This is not the case for strcmp(), nor for any other string functions
that may want to be used in the future.

Nope.  The builtins not only vary between gcc versions, but they also
have a nasty tendency to generate calls to library functions, sometimes
libgcc functions.  Hence -ffreestanding.

It's a copy-and-paste accident; already fixed in the tree.
