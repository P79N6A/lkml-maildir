It's been a while since the last set of ptrace patches; here's what I've
queued up.  They'll follow in individual messages, or they're available by
BitKeeper (details below).
These are all small changes; there may be some more interesting ones in a
couple of weeks, after GDB support for NPTL is more mature.  Overview:
  - Two new traceable events, end-of-vfork and process exit.
  - Ptrace calls to get and set the siginfo struct associated with a signal.
  - Two separate signal handling fixes for the fork-tracing and CLONE_PTRACE
    support.
  - A bugfix to prevent zombie processes when debugging LinuxThreads.

   Signal handling bugs for thread exit + ptrace
<drow@nevyn.them.org> (03/02/06 1.960)
   Add PTRACE_O_TRACEVFORKDONE and PTRACE_O_TRACEEXIT facilities.
<drow@nevyn.them.org> (03/02/04 1.959)
   Use force_sig_specific to send SIGSTOP to newly-created CLONE_PTRACE processes.
<drow@nevyn.them.org> (03/01/18 1.958)
   Add PTRACE_GETSIGINFO and PTRACE_SETSIGINFO
   
   These new ptrace commands allow a debugger to control signals more precisely;
   for instance, store a signal and deliver it later, as if it had come from the
   original outside process or in response to the same faulting memory access.

   Tweak has_stopped_jobs for use with debugging
