Although I understand your complains, you have still a chance to compare 
both sources - our ALSA CVS tree and linux BK tree to find the full 
code history.
But the changesets are really great, so I am thinking to switch the ALSA 
repository from CVS to BK soon. It will help to propagate changes better.
