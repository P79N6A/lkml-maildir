(By the way, I meant that the flag should preferably be called 
UNSHARE_NS, not UNSHARE_NEWNS -- as noted in an earlier message
in this thread, CLONE_NEWNS was itself a bad name.)
I had another thought about why using names of the form
UNSHARE_* might be worthwhile.  It just might be that in the 
future, someone might want to add a flag that has nothing
to do with clone().  I mean some flag that somehow performs
some other modification of the behaviour or unshare(), or
perhaps unshares something that isn't shared/unshared by 
clone().  (The first possibility seems more likely than 
the second.)  In that case, it would make litte sense to
name the flag(s) CLONE_xxx.
Cheers,
Michael
