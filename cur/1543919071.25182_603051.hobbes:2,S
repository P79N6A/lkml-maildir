Two issues to fix before we can do this:
1) chocie values cannot have more than one prompt
2) We need to share much more Kconfig* between the individual architectures
   First step is to let all arch's use drivers/Kconfig
Let's get the two items above solved then we can revisit adding arch selection
to kconfig (where it belongs in the end).
And neither require a rewrite of kconfig...

Discussed before but so far no patches has shown up.
