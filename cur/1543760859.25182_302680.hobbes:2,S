Yah, well.. ok, let's say we have a spec... and an implementation that
represents about 90% of the machines concerned. Those 90% have the
"bug"... what do you chose ? :) 
The separator in "compatible", afaik, is \0, not space btw.
On possibiliy would be to have the kernel replace spaces with
underscores for the sake of matching. That would make life easier for
everybody.
