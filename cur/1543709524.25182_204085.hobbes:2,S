I might be misunderstanding the options, but 'kpatchup -s' I think is
limited to giving the latest version of a single tree, while
'latest-kernel-version' will look at several different trees.  This is a
tiny problem for kpatchup because it treats 2.6, 2.6-bk, and 2.6-pre as
separate trees.  For my use, I just want the latest snapshot, whether
it's a bk snapshot, or one of the real point releases.  
What I'm doing to work around it is this:
kpatchup `latest-kernel-version --probe`
