Good point, thanks.  I never thought of that.
We can change the coremask setting while dumping the process's
memory, and it is problematic.
maydump() function which decides a given VMA may be dumped or not
is invoked twice per VMAs.  One is at the time of writing a program
header for a VMA, another is at the time of writing its contents.
If the coremask setting differs between the two, the program
header will point wrong place in the core file as its contents.

Currently, any lock isn't acquired.  But I think the kernel only
have to preserve the coremask setting in a local variable at the
begining of core dumping.  I'm going to do this in the next version.
