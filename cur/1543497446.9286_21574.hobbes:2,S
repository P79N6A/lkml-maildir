Again I can reproduce the bug I described last week. I downloaded
netperf from HP, extracted it on a mounted ncpfs volume, typed make and
- the linker hangs. I analyzed the network traffic with a packet sniffer
and found:
 - my workstation sends about 2500 requests/sec to the NetWare server,
all these requests are identical packets with incrementing sequence
number
 - the request is: ncp read file, offset 0xfc00, length 1236
 - the server replies with: ncp return code success, data length 0
I running 2.2.10-pre1. Again I will apply my patch.
