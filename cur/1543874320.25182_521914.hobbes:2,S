Hiyas,
at the moment, some file in Documentation are utf-8 encoded and some are 
latin1 encoded. Therefore I propose to change the default encoding to utf-8, 
because this is the encoding that may current linux distributions use.
I can send a patch, if required. If you want to change the encoding of a file 
from latin1 to utf-8 you can use recode:
recode latin1..utf-8 file.txt
This changes the encoding in place.
Regards,
Till
