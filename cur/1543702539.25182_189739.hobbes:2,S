Well, the big MIPS boxes behave this way too.  Ralf and Christoph, what
do you think?  The current PCI DMA mapping API is insufficient for
Origin and other Bridge/Hub boxes, although I don't think there's any
way to implement pci_sync_consistent() on Origin unless there happens to
be an extra interrupt line available for each PCI slot.  That would
allow the arch code to generate a DMA write barrier (by forcing an
interrupt as we do on sn2) that would force previous DMA into the
coherence domain before it completed.
