Better yet, here's a proposd fix.  Please give it a whirl.
The curve ball was that "illegal" IRQ9.
Its "illegalness" caused us to grab a new IRQ off the possible list,
but since it wasn't zero, we didn't scrub the new IRQ with our
usual heuristics for selecting ISA range IRQs.
I expect this will assign sound to IRQ10 or IRQ11.
