You are right.
From drivers/ata/libata-core.c:
|> static char ata_force_param_buf[PAGE_SIZE] __initdata;
|> /* param_buf is thrown away after initialization, disallow read */
|> module_param_string(force, ata_force_param_buf,
sizeof(ata_force_param_buf), 0);

type, link speed and transfer mode (see
Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt for details)");
The 0 in module_param_string are the sysfs file permissions of libata.force.
And __initdata means that the memory goes away after ata_init() returned.
