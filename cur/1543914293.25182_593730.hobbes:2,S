Mel:
I'm just getting to this after sorting out an issue with the memory
controller stuff in 23-rc4-mm1.  I'm building all my kernels with the
memory controller enabled now, as it hits areas that I'm playing in.  I
wanted to give you a heads up that vmscan.c doesn't build with
CONTAINER_MEM_CONT configured with your patches.  I won't get to this
until tomorrow.  Since you're a few hours ahead of me, you might want to
take a look.  No worries, if you don't get a chance...
Later,
Lee
