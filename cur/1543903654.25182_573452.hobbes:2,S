Subject: keyboard not found in 2.6.22.1

When I boot 2.6.22.1 on my PegasosPPC, the PS/2 keyboard is not detected. It
works in 2.6.21.5. Both kernels have:
CONFIG_KEYBOARD_ATKBD=y
CONFIG_SERIO_I8042=y
The 2.6.21.5 kernel logs this stuff during boot:
  serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
  serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
  input: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard as /class/input/input0
  atkbd.c: keyboard reset failed on isa0060/serio1
(The "keyboard reset failed" has always been there and the keyboard has
always worked, it doesn't seem to indicate any actual problem)
The 2.6.22.1 doesn't log anything like those 4 lines. The only new thing that
shows up in 2.6.22.1 is
  console handover: boot [udbg0] -> real [tty0]
Aside from those lines, there's an exact line-for-line correspondence between
the boot logs.
I can log in over the network while running the broken kernel, but I'm not
sure what information I should be gathering once I'm in there.
In my attempt to understand the workings of input/serio/i8042.c, the only
result so far is that I noticed an unimportant typo in the 2.6.22 patch
("readinng" in the comment above i8042_toggle_aux).
