While going over dcache code, I realized that d_bucket which
was introduced to prevent hash chain traversals from going into
an infinite loop earlier, is no longer necessary. Originally,
when RCU based lock-free lookup was first introduced, dcache
hash chains used list_head. Hash chain traversal was terminated
when dentry->next reaches the list_head in the hash bucket.
However, if renames happen during a lock-free lookup, a dentry
may move to different bucket and subsequent hash chain traversal from
there onwards may not see the list_head in the original bucket
at all. In fact, this would result in the list_head in the bucket
interpreted as a list_head in dentry and bad things will happen
after that. Once hlist based hash chains were introduced in dcache,
the termination condition changed and lock-free traversal would
be safe with NULL pointer based termination of hlists. This means
that d_bucket check is no longer required.
There still exist some theoritical livelocks like a dentry getting
continuously moving and lock-free look-up never terminating.
But that isn't really any worse that what we have. In return
for these changes, we reduce the dentry size by the size of
a pointer. That should make akpm and mpm happy.
