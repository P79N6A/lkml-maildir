No, I did not mean _those_ bits. This made little or difference for
me... (100mW or so, definitely not watt).
doing ahci_pci_device_{suspend,resume} should definitely do the trick,
and ahci_{start,stop}_engine might be enough.

ahci_pci_device_{suspend,resume} seems to be the code...
Here's the port of your patch to recent -git.
