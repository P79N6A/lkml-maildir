Places that inherently cannot sleep, such as inside the scheduler,
the unthreadable part of the hard IRQ code, inside the mutex
implementation, etc.

In practice, this didn't turn out to be an issue; most modern
hardware seems to be pretty tolerant of that (and you already have to
deal with things like interrupts getting in the way), and drivers
which do local_irq_disable() or to ensure timing will still work.
Has this sort of problem been seen with RT-Linux and such, which
would cause similar delays?
