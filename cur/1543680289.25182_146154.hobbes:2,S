Hi all.
With the latest prepatch for the 2.4 version of swsusp, I've made swsusp
taint the kernel upon resume from a suspend-to-disk. Any oopses that
occur afterwards will contain S as a third character (eg PFS). This so
that maintainers can be aware that software suspend might play a role in
any oopses they get.
Note that this doesn't apply to the version of software suspend in the
2.5 tree at the moment. I intend to port the 2.4 patch to 2.5/6, but if
I succeed in getting it merged, it will take a while (2.7 I guess), so
software suspend may play a role in cases where you don't get an 'S'.
Regards,
Nigel
