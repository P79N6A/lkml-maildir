Its an API that doesn't make sense.
99% of the uses can simply be eliminated (in 2.4, too).
They are entirely redundant.
The remaining two cases are really arch-specific checks that were
being done wrong anyway.  Note the history:  the definition morphed
in 2.4 from being "PCI BIOS seems to be present, so we'll assume a
PCI bus is present" to "PCI devices are present."  Neither definition
is correct for the question the remaining two cases want answered:
"Is a PCI bus present?"  Further, the IDE code calculating system
bus speed it should really be calling a PCI callback, not asking "Do
I have a PCI bus?" and making a guess...  a guess which seems wrong
in several cases, including my Dual Athlon box w/ 100% 66 Mhz PCI bus.
So, I conclude that pci_present() is wrong for all cases except one --
and that case is sparc64-specific and can be handled with arch-specific
code, I bet.
