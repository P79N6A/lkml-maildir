Flash manufactorers typically claim 100k erase cycles -- some even 1M.
If FAT is updated after each written 512 byte block, filling 64MiB
card in synchronous mode would cause over 100k FAT updates.  One
couldn't even fill a new 64MiB card without already breaking it.
With asynchronous mount, one could limit the dirty_ratio from proc to
reduce the sync time against sudden power loss. But wouldn't this have
the same adverse wearing effect as with synchronous mode once the
dirty_ratio is hit and writing still proceeds?
