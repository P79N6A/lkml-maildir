Hello, 
I'm having some trouble to mask PCI IRQs with
pci=irqmask= and I was hoping someone here could help.
I'm running linux 2.4.20 and rtai 24.1.11. My linux
kernel module needs to use IRQ 9 10 11 for AGP graphic
card, sound card and PCI-Dio24 IO card. These irqs are
also shared by USB controllers. My module hangs when
it tries to request the above irqs used by USB
devices. I figured it would be a good idea to remove
this apparent conflict. I have scoured the web and
found that I can reserve these IRQs by specifying
pci=irqmask= on the kernel boot line.
I have tried to set "pci=irqmask=0x0e10" to reserve
Irq 9 10 11 4 from my driver, and it hasn't had any
effect - those irqs are still used by usb controllers
on initialization. 
Why did this not work? How do I change these IRQ's? 
Is there some other configuration file I haven't
found? If anyone can provide any insight into this, I
would appreciate it greatly. If there is something I'm
missing let me know and I'll get it...
Thanks in advance,
jing
