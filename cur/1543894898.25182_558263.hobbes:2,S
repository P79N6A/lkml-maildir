I agree with the "/if and only if/ any ambiguity of meaning arises" part.
I'm sorry I didn't make that clear before.
However if that situation arises (i.e. the judge decides there is an
ambiguity) then as far as my experience tells me it is the intention of
the author (RMS et al in this case) that counts. But I erred before...
Best wishes,
Michael
