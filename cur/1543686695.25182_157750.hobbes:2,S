I'm not familiar with the cpu_freq code, or how true ACPI throttling is
implemented, but it sounds like the amd76x_pm driver is doing something a
little different than throttling. I tried the regular ACPI code on an IBM
desktop, and its throttling support appears to offer several distinct
throttling percentages, which would seem to be much easier to compensate
for. The amd76x_pm idle routine simply sets a bit in one of the bridge
chips, but I think that it turns the clocks back on at some indeterminate
time in the future (probably triggered by an interrupt) which would be
hard to measure if clocks are stopped.

OK. Well, I'm optimistic, so I'll try that and see if that pulls the error
down to a point where ntpd can manage to control the clock.

I'll have to try again next week-- I think the last time that I tried to
remove amd76x_pm, I didn't reset the ntp adjustments (drift, plus the
adjtimex variables) so it was fighting the old power-management values.

I'll have to check with strace (I'm using ntpd from Debian sid).
