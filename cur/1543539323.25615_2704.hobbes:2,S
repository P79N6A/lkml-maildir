Yes, this is it.  This morning I tried changing the tlbstate accesses
in switch_mm() to use xchg(), to make them atomic w.r.t. the flush
ipi, and it fixed the problem.
But getting rid of the OLD state completely seems like a neater
solution.

I'll try it this evening and let you know how it goes.  Thanks for
looking at the problem.
