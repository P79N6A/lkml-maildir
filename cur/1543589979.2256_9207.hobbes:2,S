<QUOTE>
A pipelined application implementation buffers its output before writing it to
the underlying TCP stack, roughly equivalent to what the Nagle algorithm does
for telnet connections.
These two buffering algorithms tend to interfere, and using them together will
often cause very significant performance degradation. For each connection, the
server maintains a
response buffer that it flushes either when full, or when there is no more
requests coming in on that connection, or before it goes idle. This buffering
enables aggregating responses
(for example, cache validation responses) into fewer packets even on a
high-speed network, and saving CPU time for the server.
