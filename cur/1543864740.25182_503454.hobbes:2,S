I really think we can keep these promises.  A number of us have been
doing just that for many years now, and I don't see any reason why we
would stop doing that now.
I would _love_ to be inundated with specs, so many that we run out of
developers to work on the devices.  But I really don't see that
happening any time soon, as there's not that many devices that Linux
doesn't already support.
And if such a situation does happen, perhaps I will be able to convince
some distro companies to pony up the development man-power to help us
from going back on our promise...  I know quite a few companies would
love to help out just a "problem" as it is in their best interest to
have Linux support as many devices as possible.
So please, don't be so down on the offer, you don't have to do any work
if you don't want to :)
thanks,
