Actually, allowing the deep merges to go past tags could
be useful for dragging bugfixes between the 2.4 and 2.5
kernels ...
... but I think the 'dragging' analogy is something we'll
want to keep here, not back merging across tags by default
but _trying_ to do the backmerge on demand only, when the
user wants to drag a changeset from 2.4 to 2.5.
We could just have a revtool-like interface for that.
regards,
Rik
