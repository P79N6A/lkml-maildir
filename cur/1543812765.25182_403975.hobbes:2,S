Hi,
Here is an updated set of patches for PCI legacy I/O port free drivers,
which incorporate feedbacks. Summary of changes from the previous
version is as follows:
    - Use pci_enable_device_bars() approach instead of 'no_ioport'
      approach. Please see the header of patch 1/4 for specific.
    - Update Documentation/pci.txt
    - Changed e1000 driver to use pci_enable_device_bars() instead of
      'no_ioport'.
    - Changed lpfc driver to use pci_enable_device_bars() instead of
      'no_ioport'
Greg, could you consider applying those into your test tree?
Thanks,
Kenji Kaneshige
