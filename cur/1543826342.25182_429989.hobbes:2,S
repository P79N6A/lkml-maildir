Good ideas. I'll give these things a spin. One thing that may explode is
that all that code is running with local_irq_disable() (since local irqs
aren't enabled before init_IRQ()) and that means possible use of some
types of semaphores may trigger warn-on's (or worse as I think some
implementations of down_read() might even force-enable irqs).
But there is no fundamental reasons to do so ... that's the trick :) If
that happens, those semaphores are still ok as they should never get
into contention that early.
Anyway, I'll give it a spin on ppc and maybe x86 if I can find a victim
to test on here, and will send something.
Cheers,
Ben.
