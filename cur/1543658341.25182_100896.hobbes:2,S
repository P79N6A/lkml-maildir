Or ESP, with or without encryption as well.
But that does not acheive quite the same thing, because the iSCSI digest is 
another lightweight checksum, albeit stronger than most, and does not 
provide authentication.  So AH or ESP is stronger, but slower.
Maybe Cisco are assuming another layer deals with the errors.  However, to 
get an interoperable and efficient implementation requires the capability 
to do whatever combination is required, along with sensible defaults.
