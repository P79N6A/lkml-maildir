"nice" seems to be doing quite nicely :-)
To me this capping functionality is a similar functionality to that 
provided by "nice" and all that's needed to make it useful is a command 
(similar to "nice") that runs tasks with caps applied.  To that end I've 
written a small script (attached) that does this.  As this is something 
that a user might like to combine with "nice" the command has an option 
for setting "nice" as well as caps.
Usage:
         withcap [options] command [arguments ...]
         withcap -h
Options:
         [-c <CPU rate soft cap>]
         [-C <CPU rate hard cap>]
         [-n <nice value>]
         -c Set CPU usage rate soft cap
         -C Set CPU usage rate hard cap
         -n Set nice value
         -h Display this help
