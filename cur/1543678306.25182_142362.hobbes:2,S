Two scenarios that seem to repeat it include starting Loki's Heretic2 off, and mounting the CDRW drive via WindowMaker dock app. I cannot do anything when this happens; can't hotkey out of X, can't telnet to it from my other networked PC. I have to power down and back up.
There was something like this posted on the list a few days ago. Someone
said that it has to do with IDE-SCSI timing or what not. That is, try if you can
reproduce it without the ide-scsi driver in the kernel..

That means the kernel detected something evil (oops caused by null pointer access,
etc...). Sicne the leds are still flashing, at least the kernel is not totally dead. :)
hope this helps a bit,
