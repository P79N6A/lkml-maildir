Another thing to do is to run it under the emulator x86 stuff in
XFree86, see what that shows up differently to vm86 proper. And then
there are lots of fun things that confuse video hardware - the fact
Linux is a PnP OS, the PCI configuration problems and so on. In 
paticular nobody right now (including X11 proper) virtualises
conf1/conf2 etc properly so you can crash the box easily
