Right. This is what I'm saying. And recalibration of the TS controller
can (in _most_ cases) fix that.

With some digging, maybe I can even find such a beast somewhere around
here (working for a software company, I don't my hands on large
quantities of broken hardware...).

:-) That's just messing up it's "proper" calibration and restoring
working parameters.

One of {elo,mu}touch does this. Unfortunately, the commands aren't
documented in the publically available sheets you can download from
their site. Using a serial sniffer, you can easily dismantle the
protocol to face the fact: these controller are a lot more clever than
the sheets will tell you :-)

That's simple: some plastic/rubber shoes on equal ground, you can easily
load yourself with some 10000V. Touch it once, maybe it survives the
smoke. And possibly, the controller will loose it's flash contents...
Decalibrating by electrostatic discharge is even something that our
customers are able to _mention_ at the phone ("My finger hurt, it felt
like something bite me, the muscles and nerves hurt in my arm, the
computer crashed and upon reboot, I couldn't press the correct
pictograms...")

Yeah, right you are.

Sure. (I'll write you off-list tomorrow.)
