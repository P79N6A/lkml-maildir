Low-end Intel multi-CPU chipsets are like this (typical 2-CPU configurations,
and low-end 4-CPU configurations).  Higher-end systems (8-way, etc) typically
have multiple processor busses, with only one, two, or four processors per bus.
Processor bus contention costs performance even in 2-way systems, and at 4-way
and above, it becomes a serious bottleneck.  High end chipsets do the cache
coherency and snooping control between the busses.  Other N-way chipsets
(i.e., non-Intel) have point-to-point links between each CPU and the chipset.
The new AMD 760 chipset for Athlon is like this; so are N-way Alpha chipsets.
I can't swear to other hardware.

Ask ServerWorks about this.  They make 16-way Intel chipsets.  It's possible,
just not cheap.

Which is one of the reasons for a pont-to-point "bus" with Alpha and Athlon
CPUs.
