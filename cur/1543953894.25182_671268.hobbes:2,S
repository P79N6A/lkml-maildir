This seems like it might be detectable, does this seem like something we
should try an report?
WARNING: arguments for function declarations should follow identifier

Yeah, we did only look for explicitly extern'd declarations.  But this
form seems detectable, will be in v0.17.
WARNING: externs should be avoided in .c files
#2: FILE: Z110.c:2:
+int __init preallocate_diu_videomemory(void);
