Yes!! I second that motion!! On top of that, we need buffer/page cache hit
rate statistics!! Once your read hit rate gets up into the high 90
percentages, more buffer/page cache memory is wasted.
If Linux is to succeed in enterprise-level usage, we *must* have tools to
measure, manage and tune performance -- in short, to do capacity planning
like we do on any other system. And the kernel variables that affect
performance *must* be under control of the system administrator and
ultimately the machine's *customers*, *not* a bunch of kernel geeks! That
means keeping them in variables accessible by a system administrator, *not*
#defines in code that must be entirely recompiled when you want to tweak a
parameter.
If you build it, they will come :). If you *refuse* to build it, they will
use something else -- it's as simple as that.
