Subject: [PATCH] de_thread: eliminate unneccessary sighand locking
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/6/19/35

while switching current->sighand de_thread does:
	write_lock_irq(&tasklist_lock);
	spin_lock(&oldsighand->siglock);
	spin_lock(&newsighand->siglock);
	current->sighand = newsighand;
	recalc_sigpending();
Is these 2 sighand locks are really needed?
At this moment we already zapped other threads, so nobody
can access newsighand via current->. And we are holding
tasklist_lock, so other processes can't send signals to us
or use our ->sighand in any way.
oldsighand can be seen from CLONE_SIGHAND processes, but
we are not using oldsighand in any way, so this lock seems
to be unneeded too.
The only possibility that I can imagine is that some process
does:
	read_lock(tasklist_lock);
	task = find_task();
	spin_lock(task->sighand->siglock);
	read_unlock(tasklist_lock);
	play with task->signal
Is this possible/allowed?
And why do we need recalc_sigpending() ? We are not changing
->pending or ->blocked, just ->sighand.
