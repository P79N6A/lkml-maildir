hmmm. that's a good catch. so, with this patch A increments h_buffer_credits
and this one will go to the t_outstanding_credits while the buffer is still
part of the transaction. indeed, an imbalance.
probably something like the following would be enough?
 +	/* return credit back to the handle if it was really spent */
 +	if (credits) {
 +		handle->h_buffer_credits++; 
 +              spin_lock(&handle->h_transaction->t_handle_lock);
 +              handle->h_transaction->t_outstanding_credits++;
 +              spin_lock(&handle->h_transaction->t_handle_lock);
 +      }
thanks, Alex
