Here was long discussion on subject already. Short summary: it's binary only
driver and so you can use it only in certain versions of kernel and even then
there are no guarantee that this will work in all confirations of kernel.
So if you already have SB Live it's good news for you: even binary driver
is better then nothing. But if you want decent PCI Sound Card then better
buy something Trident 4DWave based and use ALSA instead...
