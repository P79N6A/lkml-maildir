Yes. Pivot_root works, all right, but it rotates (your process' root, old, new).
So it works in chroot correctly now. And since we chroot out of the
absolute root when we mount initrd (or final root, for that matter) any
setup that used pivot_root keeps working as it did.
As for "never to be reclaimed"... Let's see:
	1 struct super_block
	1 struct vfsmount
	couple of struct dentry
	couple of struct inode
(for values of couple from 1 to 4; we can reduce it to 1 but I didn't bother
with that; all it takes is a couple of calls of sys_rmdir()/sys_unlink()).
Compared to the amount of space we free in .code of fs/super.c it's noise.
