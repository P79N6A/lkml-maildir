I want the x86 CPU error code, which often has interesting clues on the problem.
trapno would be useful too. I suspect other CPUs have similar extended
state for exceptions.
I usually hack my kernel to printk() it, but having it in the coredump
would be more general and you can look at it later.
Eventually (in a future kernel) I would love to have the exception
handler save the last branch debugging registers of the CPU and the let the
core dumper put that into the dump too.  Then you could easily
figure out what the program did shortly before the crash.
