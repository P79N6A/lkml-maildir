	It doesn't matter what that fraction is, so long as the fraction is
constant with respect to the number of fds, my argument is still valid.

	Exactly. Smart multithreaded programs move the 'busy' fds into one pollfd
struct and the 'not so busy' fds into another. This way, the expensive poll
call (the one with the most fds) is made as rarely as possible. However,
this is a pain to do.

	Exactly. No matter how good your event or poll logic is, you'll still have
O(n) work to do. So if your notification mechanism is less than O(n), it
will ultimately drop off into the noise. Poll, if properly implemented is
less than O(n). Events, with an optimization to fall back to poll if there
are 'too many' is less than O(n) too.
	But the thing is, if events fall back to poll under high load, how can they
be more scalable than poll? That strikes me as an absurd argument.
	I am, however, convinced that events will use less CPU under low load. I am
not convinced that events are any more scalable than poll.

	Even if the fraction is 1%, it's still a fraction. So it won't affect
scalability. And, in fact, the longer it takes you to get back to 'poll',
the higher this fraction will be. So from a scalability perspective, this is
actually a benefit.
