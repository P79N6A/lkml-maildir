I have another suggestion for the MAINTAINER list:
Put the filenames/directories the maintainer is responsible of, perhaps
in a hierarchical tree (X maintains usb drivers, Y maintains usb
keyboards, Z maintains usb keyboard from such vendor).
This should be coherent and easily parsable.
This way, someone which has to send several patches can make a little
script which finds the correct maintainers to send its stuff to.
I've already been in that situation, currently it's a pain.
