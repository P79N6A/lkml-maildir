Hi,
I'm experiencing small problems with APM (kernel is 2.2.5) on two
different machines:
(1) On my Thoshiba laptop suspend/resume works fine (as long as
    I have the card manager eject the PCMCIA ethernet card on suspend).
    However, after resuming sound stops to work. The logs contain:
Apr 10 11:39:16 click kernel: eth0: 3Com 3c589, port 0x300, irq 3, Auto port, hw
_addr 00:60:97:CD:3B:9C 
Apr 10 11:39:17 click kernel: eth0: switched to 10base2 port 
Apr 10 11:56:45 click kernel: apm: busy: Parameter out of range 
Apr 10 11:56:50 click kernel: apm: busy: Parameter out of range 
Apr 10 14:09:47 click kernel: eth0: 3Com 3c589, port 0x300, irq 3, Auto port, hw
_addr 00:60:97:CD:3B:9C 
Apr 10 14:09:47 click kernel: eth0: switched to 10base2 port 
Apr 10 14:11:17 click kernel: Sound: DMA (output) timed out - IRQ/DRQ config err
or? 
Apr 10 14:11:25 click last message repeated 5 times
(2) Power off behaves strangely on my Compaq EN6500 PC at work: if I
    shutdown the machine (and yes, I have "halt -d -f -i -p" in
    /etc/init.d/halt) the machine seems to actually power down, I can
    here the disks spin down, power-on light goes out etc. But after
    a few seconds the darn thing starts to boot up again! (It's actually
    tricky to power off manually in this situation as Compaq 
    equipped the box with a "software-controlled" power switch which you
    have to press for at least 4 seconds to override whatever software
    is controlling it and let you turn the machine off.)
Any ideas? Configuration for APM is identical on both machines:
CONFIG_APM=y
# CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_USER_SUSPEND is not set
CONFIG_APM_DO_ENABLE=y
CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE=y
CONFIG_APM_DISPLAY_BLANK=y
CONFIG_APM_POWER_OFF=y
CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_MULTIPLE_SUSPEND=y
CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_SUSPEND_BOUNCE=y
# CONFIG_APM_RTC_IS_GMT is not set
# CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS is not set
Cheers, Roderich
