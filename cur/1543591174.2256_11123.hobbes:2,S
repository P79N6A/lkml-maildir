Nico's point is that there is a lot of linux beyond PCs. My LART[1] has
three serial ports which I didn't label at all. The official SA1100
serial driver has /dev/ttySA[0-2] allocated. Other ARM systems use
/dev/ttyS0. Guess what happens when you want to install debian-arm on
an SA1100 system. A serial device registry like we have for the sound
cards would be most welcome.
