Really? It's been a while since I've done any measurements, but IIRC,
I was getting IRQ latencies of about 20 us on a 386 back in September
1998. Sure, sometimes it would be much worse (other drivers blocking
IRQs), but it indicated the basic code path was short.
Context switches were < 25 us.

Do you have numbers showing that things have gotten much worse as time
has progressed? And by how much? If so, it's worth looking into.
It may be some slowdowns are due to greater emphasis on correctness,
as bugs and races have been found. However, efforts like removing the
big kernel lock should be improving the situation.
