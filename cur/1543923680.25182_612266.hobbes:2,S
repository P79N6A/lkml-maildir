In general, so that we can automatically allocate loop devices (as with
losetup -f) and have them disappear when we're done with them.
In particular, right now, so that we can stop relying on the hackish
special-case in umount(8) which kills off loop devices which were set up
by 'mount -oloop'. That means we can stop putting crap in /etc/mtab
which doesn't belong there, which means it can be a symlink
to /proc/mounts, which means yet another writable file on the root
filesystem is eliminated and the 'stateless' folks get happier... and
OLPC trac #356 can be closed.
The mount(8) side of that is at
