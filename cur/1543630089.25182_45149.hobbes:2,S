Hi
One change in kernel 2.4.x is to send a SIGBUS signal to the process
trying to read a mmap section that is invalid.
Ex, if we have a file server, and that program gets a request for a file,
it does a mmap. After that starts serving the file to the client (by
write()-ing to the socket fd). If in the meantime some other process
truncates the file which was mmap-ed , our program will receive a SIGBUS
in write().
If I understand right this is more POSIX compliant.
Is there a clean/good way of handling this ?
PS: why signal(SIGBUS,SIG_IGN) doesnt work, but a user handler its called
if set with signal(SIGBUS,handle_sigbus) ?
Thanks
