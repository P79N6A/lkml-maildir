im sorry, i do not understand this.
you are saying that if you copy files larger than 100mb into drive, all
files die?

okay, i think thats what you are saying, could you please try to run
dosfsck on it so we can see 100% whats wrong?
also, try to do this:
mount, copy, run command 'sync', unmount, pull out, and see if it works.
finally, one more question. you said it does not work when you take it
home, can you try this: mount, copy, unmount, mount, check to see if
file works.
