And the solution is to fail the allocation of the process which tries to 
walk away with it. The failing allocation will lead to the killing of the 
process right?
We already have an OOM killer which potentially kills random processes. We 
hate it.
Could you please modify the patchset to *avoid* failure conditions. This 
patchset here only manages failure conditions. The system should not get 
into the failure conditions in the first place! For that purpose you may 
want to put processes to sleep etc. But in order to do so you need to 
figure out which processes you need to make progress.
