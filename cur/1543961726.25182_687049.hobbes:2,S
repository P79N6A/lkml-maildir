Subject: [patch, -git] drivers/media build fix for modular builds
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

fix allmodconfig build bug introduced in latest -git by commit 
7c91f0624a9 ("V4L/DVB(7767): Move tuners to common/tuners"):
  LD      kernel/built-in.o
  LD      drivers/built-in.o
  ld: drivers/media/built-in.o: No such file: No such file or directory
which happens if all media drivers are modular:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/misc/config-Wed_Apr_30_09_24_48_CEST_2008.bad
In that case there's no obj-y rule connecting all the built-in.o files and
the link tree breaks.
the fix is to add a guaranteed obj-y rule for the core vmlinux to build.
(which results in an empty object file if all media drivers are modular)
