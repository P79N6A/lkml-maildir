VAX/VMS spawn is not related in any way to the Unix notion of spawn.
In VAX/VMS, one can create a process without copying the parent. The
newly created process can directly execute a program file once created.
This is the VAX/VMS notion of spawn. The DCL "SPAWN" command executes
the create process library call with the command interpreter (DCL.EXE)
as the program to be executed, and the command-line parameters entered
by the user. Its Unix functional equivalent is (command-line) "sh
command-file" or (C-program) system("command"); However, functional
equivalence aside, internal to the Operating System, they are not the
same.
