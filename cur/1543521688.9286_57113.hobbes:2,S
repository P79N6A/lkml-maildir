But then you have to write one (or find a small one). That seems to be te
price we pay for keeping the kernel clean from things that can be done in
userspace. Unfortunately, it means that esspeccialy the (embedded)
developers have to write something theirselfves because of space
limitations.

Hmmm. So for embedded linux systems (where space is critical), we probably
should use a small libc library with a very small linker or use one
statically linked do-it-all application, with the disadvantage that you
cannot use standard sources too easily :-(
