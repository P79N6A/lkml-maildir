We're building 2.4 and 2.5 kernels for s390 with a gcc-3.3 snapshot and we had to
fix a few places in the kernel source to make that work reliably. See
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=104611164800008&r=1&w=2 for more about this.
I have also tried using gcc-3.3 for building a 2.4 i386 kernel and needed a
small patch, but ymmv.
