Hi Daniel & folks,
just tried your patch on my (diskless) asus a7v133 (kt133) with 1.2 GHz
Athlon. I normally had 14% base load spend in apmd-idled and a CPU temp.
of 45°C. After getting it to work, I see a base load of around 1% (mostly 
spend in artsd), but CPU is only 1°-2° less now :-( I hoped, it it
would be more). Nevertheless, it is a very important patch nowadays where
temperature is the last technical barrier, and energy saving an economic
necessity.
Many thanks and greetings from Berlin to Trier ;)
  Hans-Peter
