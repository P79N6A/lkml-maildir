Could you try this for the original paper -
http://www.rdrop.com/users/paulmck/rclock/rclockpdcsproof.pdf
Looks like Paul has rearranged his paper site.
And I messed up while rearranging the stuff in LSE. I have now restored
the link to the OLS paper. Could you please retry ?
Sorry about the inconvenience.
Thanks
Dipankar
