In the sparc-next tree:
ls arch/sparc64
ls: arch/sparc64: No such file or directory
We have unified sparc and sparc64 so they are in the same arch directory now.
This will hit mainline in the upcoming merge window.
This has happended over at the sparclinux mailing list as this was
sparc/sparc64 specific stuff so no wonder you have not heard about it.
