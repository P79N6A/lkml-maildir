Sure. Fundamentally, though, I think it is the wrong approach to
take - it's a workaround for a big negative side effect of
increasing page size. It introduces lots of complexity and
difficult-to-test corner cases; judging by the tail packing problems
reiser3 has had over the years, it has the potential to be a
never-ending source of data corruption bugs.
I think that fine granularity and aggregation for efficiency of
scale is a better model to use than increasing the base page size.
With PPC, you can handle different page sizes in the hardware (like
MIPS) and the use of 64k base page size is an obvious workaround to
the problem of not being able to use multiple page sizes within the
OS.
Adding a workaround (tail packing) to address the negative side
effects of another workaround (64k base page size) ignores the basic
problem that has led to both these things being done: Linux does not
support multiple page sizes natively.....
Cheers,
Dave.
