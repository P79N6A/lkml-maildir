You might do, but it's incompatible with the POSIX standard.  As I
explained to Rogier (he took it off list) there's no need for "inexact"
flags.
If we pass a baud rate via tcsetattr() (or ioctl), you should set what
ever settings you can.  If you can set _no_ settings, you return an
error.  If you can set at least one setting, you do not return an error,
and you only set those settings you can do.
When you subsequently read the settings via tcgetattr(), POSIX requires
that the returned information be what the port is _actually_ doing.
So, this means that if you can only do 9599 baud and not 9600 baud,
maybe you should be returning 9599 baud.
On the same subject, if you don't support RTS/CTS flow control, and
userland requests CRTSCTS, you shouldn't be allowing CRTSCTS to be set.
And indeed, if you don't allow that in the kernel today, stty will
correctly issue a warning that it was "unable to perform all requested
operations".
So, while I whole heartedly agree with passing baud rates numerically,
I do not think we need any of this inexact flagging nonsense provided
we implement something as userland programs expect - iow, the POSIX
behaviour.
