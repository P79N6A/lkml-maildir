All that these "organizations" are doing is collecting REAL requirements for 
features that REAL application developers need.  As well as putting up 
resources to enable the features.
These features represent input from real application developers and system 
integrators on requirements that would be cool for their applications if 
Linux supported them.  Why not look at them from the "what features are 
missing from Linux today and by whom" point of view?
It is also true that most of the requirements exist only if there is some type 
of implementation available.  As such patches for many of the components of 
such specifications are by definition already available at the time of the 
announcement.  (most may need significant work to bring up to date with the 
current kenrel tree, but they do exist)  
The patches do get submitted on a regular basis to the LKML.  Many seem to get 
ignored.  Some of them should, but it seems to me that if features keep 
coming up as requirements in such "specifications" and resources continue to 
work on the feature, then there must be some real need for it.  
BTW, Has anyone actually looked at the latest high res timer patch for 2.6.5?  
I has a new design for the sub-jiffies timer interrupt source.  
It provides an implementation of a the missing feature of low jitter (< 1ms), 
system wide time base via a standard API. ( POSIX would be nice)
