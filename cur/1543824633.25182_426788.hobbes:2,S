Why do you drop this lock just to pick it up again a few instructions
down the line? (is ra_cache_hit_ok or cound_cache_hit very big or
unable to be called without the lock?)

Yuck. Apart from not being commented, this depends on internal
implementation of radix-tree. This should just be packaged up in some
radix-tree function to do exactly what you want (eg. is there a hole of
N contiguous pages).
And then again you can be rid of the radix-tree cache.
Yes, it increasingly appears that you're using the cache because you're
using the wrong abstractions. Eg. this is basically half implementing
some data-structure internal detail.
