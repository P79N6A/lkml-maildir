That's correct.

The daemon function is really just the inner fork and setsid. So with
using the daemon function it looks like this:
       if ((pid = fork()) < 0) {
                perror("fork");
        } else if (!pid) {
                if (daemon(0,0) < 0) {
                        exit(-1);
                }
		/* daemon code here */
		exit(0);
        }
        waitpid(pid,NULL,0);
