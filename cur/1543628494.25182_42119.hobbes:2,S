You _can't_ get consistent snapshots without cooperation from fs.  LVM,
EVMS, whatever.  Only filesystem knows what IO needs to be pushed to
make what we have on device consistent and what IO needs to be held
back.  Neither VFS nor device driver do not and can not have such
knowledge - it depends both on fs layout and on implementation details.
