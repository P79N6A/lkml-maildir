OK - anyone can do this. So I will not worry.

I heard it like "Ok for new syscalls".
And it is resonable for new syscalls because:
  o Make the test of the syscall public
  o Is a nice example of the usage of the syscalls (both good and bad cases)
  o Is availbale for other platforms that plan to implement the same syscall
  o We (at least a few sufficiently skilled ones) will then review not only
    the syscall but also the use of the syscall

OK - may give it a spin one day.
But I hope someone that have done similar stuff can come
with some example code we can adapt to the kernel.
