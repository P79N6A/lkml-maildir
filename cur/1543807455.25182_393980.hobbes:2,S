It still registers my docking bridge as -1:
acpiphp: ACPI Hot Plug PCI Controller Driver version: 0.5
acpiphp: Slot [4294967295] registered
acpiphp_ibm: ibm_find_acpi_device:  Failed to get device

information<3>acpiphp_ibm: ibm_find_acpi_device:  Failed to get device
information<3>acpiphp_ibm: ibm_acpiphp_init: acpi_walk_namespace
failed
radeonfb: Retrieved PLL infos from BIOS
...which is still better than not registering it at all :-).
This one actually does not oops at insertion into dock. Good!
It detects insertion into dock:
