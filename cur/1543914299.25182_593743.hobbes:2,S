If his base package was RedHat, he can just download the sources
he wants, from ftp.kernel.org, un-tar the *.gz file into /usr/src,
then copy the .config used to build the existing kernel from /boot.
It is called /boot/config-`uname -r`. Copy that to the new
kernel tree as ".config" then chdir to that tree and execute
`make oldconfig`. Some questions will have to be answered because
the newer kernel will have additional drivers.
