I try with alsa modules on Debian with a 2.2.17 kernel :
Sound modules loads but nothoing appeared in logs.
Alsaplayer cannot initialize libalsa.so 
amixer returns :
The ALSA sound driver was not detected in this system.
Under Mandrake 7.2, it's just the same...
I *really* think that the problem related to what lspci output :
00:0a.0 VGA compatible unclassified device: Creative Labs SB Live! EMU10000 (rev 08)

A "VGA compatible" device for a sound card is quite strange. I think that's why X is confused.

Fred.
