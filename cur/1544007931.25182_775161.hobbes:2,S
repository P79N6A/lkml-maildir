I could probably do more to fix the cache line bouncing, but that is not
the number one concern rigth now. It is already a big overhead, both 
memory and performance. That will be something I may address later.

This once is also packaged with ftrace, so it makes it nice and tidy ;-)
I'm sure more people will be interested in such a thing outside of -mm.
I doubt that it will ever be turned on in a production kernel.

I'd go with both. If it should not be likely in both the short and long
term than it should not be likely (same goes with unlikely). I think this 
will serve more in the case of removing unlikely's than to add them.

OK, that is good to know. There was just a couple of things that I took 
from your patch set and I stated them. I wrote the first version without 
even knowing about you patch, and it was Andrew that pointed it out to me.
The two things that I took was the use of the builtin_constant_p and to 
use __FILE__ instead of IP.
