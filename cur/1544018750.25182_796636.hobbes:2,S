When switching (removing IDE support) in favor of the new PATA support 
under the SATA menu, is there any best practice/or method of knowing what 
the new root hdd will be upon reboot?
Example:
If I have 10 sata disks and 2 IDE disks on various cards/controllers, how 
do I know /dev/hda will become /dev/sda?  In one test on a system I have 
here, /dev/hda became /dev/sdb2 after reboot, not an issue if the box is 
local, but if the box is remote, how do you cope with this?  I ask now 
because some IDE drivers have been removed (nvidia I believe? in 2.6.28) 
and I cannot upgrade the kernel anymore unless I move to the 
PATA-supported SATA driver, but I have no idea what the root disk will be 
after a reboot and there is a high probability it will not come back after 
a reboot..
Justin.
