Cough. Because that "flush_work()" was renamed to cancel_work_sync(). Because
it really cancells the work_struct if it can.
Now we have flush_work() which does not cancel, but waits for completion of
the single work_struct. Of course, it can hang if the caller holds the lock
which can be taken by another work in that workqueue.
