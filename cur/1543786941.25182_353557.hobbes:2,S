Well, they are somewhat different:
Linux version 2.6.12-rc5 (lyakh@poirot.grange) (gcc version 3.3.4 (Debian 
1:3.3.4-13)) #1 Sun May 29 22:53:31 CEST 2005
Linux version 2.6.13.1 (lyakh@poirot.grange) (gcc version 3.3.5 (Debian 
1:3.3.5-13)) #1 Sat Sep 17 11:57:51 CEST 2005
... No gcc-4.0, but still - 3.3.4 and 3.3.5... I could try recompiling 
2.6.12 with 3.3.5... Do you REALLY believe it could be the reason?

Doesn't Oops for me under 2.6.13.1 compiled with 3.3.5, that's where I get 
errors.
