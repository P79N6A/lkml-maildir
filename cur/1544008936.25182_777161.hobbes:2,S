So: remove barriers completely and use only blkdev_issue_flush to flush 
disk cache. Because none of the major filesystems learned to use 
barrier-optimized commits and this 
"barriers-randomly-fail-with-EOPNOTSUPP" fact makes it impossible to use 
them in an optimized way anyway.
There is another point:
"what is the main performance advantage of barriers?" - "that the user can 
turn on hardware write cache with hdparm -W 1 command".
And if barriers fail at random points, the user can't turn on disk cache 
anyway (he would get data corruption if barrier write failed and hardware 
write cache was enabled). So barriers make no sense here.

And what about fdatasync()?
