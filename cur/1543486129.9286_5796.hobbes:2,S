Hi there, John. Thanks for the reply. I'm sorry to say I just got the
ISDN working, though... (Well, I'm not sorry.. Just sorry I didn't aks
around any earlier :) )

Apparantly, it was, still. After doing a kernel-recompile with all the
ISDN options enabled, especially the ones I didn't have a clue about as to
their meaning, it suddenly, magically, worked. Hrmpf. i prefer to know WHY
it works, though ;)

It has me stumped, too. Seems like the ppp-authorisation process assigns
me a different gateway address than the one right on the other end of the
link. I don't know exactly HOW that works, but I haven't changed it since
the newsgroup posting, and it works now.

I didn't have defaultroute enabled at the time just so I could see at what
stage something was going wrong. Other than that, I had those settings
enabled (aren't quite sure about lock, not at home now). I also had the
use-ipcp-local-address (or something similiar) and the same for remote
address enabled.

That, and a kernel recompile. Let's see...
First recompile to install the 2.2 kernel
Then recompile with the isdn patch
Then recompile with the isdn-utils patch (? At least I think the
isdnutils patched something, too?)
Then recompile again now with all the ISDN protocol options on.
Of course I COULD have recompiled only once. Just got carried away ;)

See above.

I know! I suddenly had to go back to using NO internet link after I broke
my ISDN by going to kernel 2.2 (I will read the docs next time.. I will
read the docs next time... I will read the doc next time BEFORE
INSTALLING!)
