Hello...
I think I am getting a stack overflow when Linux is parsing the ACPI tables (initializing all the devices and running all the _STA methods).  I am using the x86_64 architecture.  I would like to try increasing the kernel stack size, but I'm not sure how to go about doing this.  Could someone tell me how to increase the kernel stack size?  (And, has anyone else seen a problem with stack overflows with ACPI?)
Thanks!
