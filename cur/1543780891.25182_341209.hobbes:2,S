Okay. Thanks. This means that hardware somehow swapped bits
before doing a CRC. I wasn't aware that this was even possible
as it would require additional storage, well I guess anything
is now possible in a FPGA.
The "Bible" has been:
 	
http://www.joegeluso.com/software/articles/ccitt.htm
Note that on the very first page, reference, is made to
the 0x1021 poly. Then there is source-code that is entirely
incompatible with anything in the kernel, but is supposed to
work (it does work on my hardware).
I have spent over a week grabbing everything on the Web that
could help decipher the CCITT CRC and they all show this
same kind of code and same kind of organization. Nothing
I could find on the Web is like the linux kernel ccitt_crc.
Go figure.
Do you suppose it was bit-swapped to bypass a patent?
