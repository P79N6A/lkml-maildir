... which GCC didn't use to do.  It used to generate RTL directly from
the source.  From the GCC news and announcements page:
October 5, 2001
    Alexandre Oliva of Red Hat has generalized the tree inlining
    infrastructure, formerly in the C++ front end, so that it is now
    used in the C front end too.

No, it's not.  It's always been this way.  You seemed to ignore that

"Next the statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon 
the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
