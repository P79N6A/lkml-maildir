hold everything.  i *thought* i understood this, now i'm not so sure.
i zipped thru fs/Kconfig, and extracted all of the options i could
find that were either "bool" or "tristate" with no labels.  supposedly,
these are never visible to the user.  examples:
config QUOTACTL
	bool
	depends on XFS_QUOTA || QUOTA
	default y
config JBD
	bool
	default EXT3_FS
	---help---
config UMSDOS_FS
	bool
	---help---
config RAMFS
	bool
	default y
	---help---
config SUNRPC
	tristate
	default m if NFS_FS!=y && NFSD!=y && (NFS_FS=m || NFSD=m)
	default y if NFS_FS=y || NFSD=y
config LOCKD
	tristate
	default m if NFS_FS!=y && NFSD!=y && (NFS_FS=m || NFSD=m)
	default y if NFS_FS=y || NFSD=y
config LOCKD_V4
	bool
	depends on NFSD_V3 || NFS_V3
	default y
config EXPORTFS
	tristate
	default NFSD
config RXRPC
	tristate
	default m if AFS_FS=m
	default y if AFS_FS=y
config ZISOFS_FS
	tristate
	depends on ZISOFS
	default ISO9660_FS
config FS_MBCACHE
	tristate
	depends on EXT2_FS_XATTR || EXT3_FS_XATTR
	default y if EXT2_FS=y || EXT3_FS=y
	default m if EXT2_FS=m || EXT3_FS=m
config FS_POSIX_ACL
	bool
	depends on EXT2_FS_POSIX_ACL || EXT3_FS_POSIX_ACL || JFS_POSIX_ACL
	default y
  so, according to the above, i would *always* get RAMFS, no matter
what?  there's no way to turn this off?
  but what about UMSDOS_FS?  it's a non-displayed boolean, but
it has no dependencies, and more weirdly, no default value.
so what will it be set to?  and why *shouldn't* i be able to
select UMSDOS support or not?
  and if they're not displayed, why do some of them have help
screens?  and why can't i get to sleep?  argh.
