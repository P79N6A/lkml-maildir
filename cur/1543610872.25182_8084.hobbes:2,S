Patrick,
Word of advise kind sir -- by asbestos or get thicker skin.
In the past I was one of the absolute worst BLOW-TORCH carries here,
so just learn to live and let live....
Also w/ an name like "Patrick McFarland" you should be an equal
opportunity asre kicker!  Red-n-Green to make Black-n-Blue!
Cheers,
