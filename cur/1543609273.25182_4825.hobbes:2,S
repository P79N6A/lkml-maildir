It is jumping to la-la land, apparently from "do_swap_page()". The
interesting part there is that do_swap_page() doesn't even follow any
suspicious function pointers or anything..
Can you do a
	gdb vmlinux
and send me the output of "disassemble do_swap_page", along with a copy
of the oops (the latter just because I don't keep archives of
linux-kernel, so I don't want to have to search for the oops again).
Oh, and only the first oops tends to be the really interesting one -
after the kernel has oopsed once, kernel data structures are quite
possibly corrupt, and subsequent oopses are suspect. That do_swap_page
one _was_ the first oops, right?
