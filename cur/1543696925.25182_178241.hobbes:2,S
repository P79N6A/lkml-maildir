Why do people hate irqdebug?
Sure, there's some overhead on big machines, but there aren't that many of 
them, and you can just disable them for those.
The fact is, irqdebug _has_ resulted in a few reports where instead of a 
silent and total lock-up, the kernel just said "I'll disable this irq" and 
the machine continued limping along.
Which is a huge improvement, since otherwise especially newcomers really 
have nothing to even report. Just "it locked up at boot" is not very 
useful, while a "it said nobody cared about irq5 and now my PCMCIA card 
doesn't work" is a _huge_ cluebat.
It doesn't catch everything, but it doesn't really cost anything on any
normal machines either..
