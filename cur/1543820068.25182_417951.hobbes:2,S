Subject: IPC SHM changed; shmat does not return same shared memory address for all processes (virtual) after 2.6.8 ?

Hello,
can anyone please explain me why there is a change in shmat so that
each process gets different address(looks like virtual) to shared
memory ?
(even though i give parameter shmaddr)
E.g. 8 processes sharing same XImage including xserver on local machine.
If i get different address on each process then xserver fails to
access the image.
This worked fine to kernel version 2.6.8.
Is there any solution to this ?
Will it stay like this in future ?
Thanks,
Domen
