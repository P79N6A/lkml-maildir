Oh, we shouldn't be doing this sort of thing when the kernel threads are
refrigerated.  We do need kswapd services for the trick you tried.
And all flavours of ext3_writepage() can block on kjournald activity, so if
kjournald is refrigerated during the memory shrink the machine can deadlock.
It would be much better to freeze kernel threads _after_ doing the big
memory shrink.
