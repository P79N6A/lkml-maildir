Hello,
Just recently I've tried to compile kernel 2.4.1 on my RH 6.2 machine
that runs 2.2.14.
All my utilities needed in order to compile that kernel are up to date.
When I got thru xmake config and I configure all the options. I try to
compile it.
When I do make dep I dont' get any error messages.
When I do either make bzImage or make zImage I get the following errors
at the very beginning:

This is just a part of the error messages that appear. It happens at the
very beginning.
Can someone help. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Since in the past
I've compiled kernel 2.4.0
w/o any problems. I even reinstalled RH 6.2 just to make sure that
everything is clean prior to compiling kernel 2.4.1
Someone please help. I need my USB and Sound Card to work.
Thanks,
- Lucas
