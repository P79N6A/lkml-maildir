Hi,
I am trying to get hardware sensors (i.e. cpu temp, fan speed, and 
voltage sensors) working on an IBM eServer 335 system that is running 
RedHat (Enterprise edition) with kernel 2.4.21 (2.4.21-27 actually).
The driver for the sensors chip on this particular mainboard is found 
using sensors-detect:
Use driver `i2c-piix4' for device 00:0f.0: ServerWorks CSB5 South Bridge
However, the driver failed to load with the following error:
i2c-core.o: i2c core module
i2c-dev.o: i2c /dev entries driver module
i2c-core.o: driver i2c-dev dummy driver registered.
i2c-piix4.o version 2.6.5 (20020915)
i2c-piix4.o: Found CSB5 device
dmi_scan.o version 2.6.5 (20020915)
dmi_scan.o: SM BIOS found
i2c-piix4.o: IBM Laptop detected; this module may corrupt
              your serial eeprom! Refusing to load module!
i2c-piix4.o: Module insertion failed.
Obviously this machine is not an IBM Laptop!  It is, in fact, a 
rackmount server.  My question is: is this machine still at risk of 
this EEPROM corruption bug that is present in (what looks like 
exclusively) certain models of IBM Thinkpads?  I can easily comment out 
this logic and recompile, but I really don't want to break my EEPROM!  
Can anyone tell me with reasonable certainty that I won't break my 
machine by forcibly installing this module?
I'd upgrade to a newer version of the linux kernel, but other users of 
the machine have requested the kernel version be kept for support 
reasons.
Any and all insight is greatly appreciated!
Thanks!
