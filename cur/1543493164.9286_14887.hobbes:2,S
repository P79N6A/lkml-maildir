Yes, this is in theory as safe as denying exec(2).  The few attacks
I've seen tricked the targeted daemon into exec()ing a shell and used
that.  Suppose an attacker wants to create/modify a file to influence
the system.  Going through a shell would still be feasible in a system
using capabilities, as the shell probably is marked to inherit some
basic privileges like creating/reading/writing files, directories,
and sockets.  Without exec(2) the attack has to trick the daemon into
doing the malicious stuff itself, which in theory is not any harder,
but might be more inconvenient for the attacker.
A exec(2)-capability probably wasn't such a good idea after all, as
many daemons have a need to exec(2): sendmail -> procmail, ftpd -> ls,
bind -> named-xfer, finderd -> finger, ...
