Actually yes and no. With 10g, the "product" directory contain the (3
digits) version number (unrelated the actual ora home). 
The different positions are well defined according to oracle, releases have
changes in the first 4 positions, where the first is the major product
version, the second is the release, the third are platform independend
features. The base release for 10g was 10.1.0.2, and the first patchset is
10.1.0.3

This has a bit changed with 10g.
