Hi,
DMA is disabled on my system by default. Looks like I have a different problem
from yours. I tried it with 2.2.9 UP and it boots up fine. 2.2.9 SMP is no good.
(Both compiled with gcc-2.7.2.3).
With 2.2.9 SMP, I have also observed that sometimes it continually prints "lost
interrupt" during the partition check, but sometimes the system hangs completely
at the partition check.
