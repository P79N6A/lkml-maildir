Yesterday I put 2.5.56 on my SQL server and PostgreSQL started panicking 
repeatedly and frequently complaining about missing commit logs.  2.5.56 
also issued a single NMI .. dazed and confused but continuing warning 
shortly after startup.
Rebooting back into 2.4 and the world was well again.  Attached is my 
.config in bz2 form.
