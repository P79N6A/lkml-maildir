Again, notice that my heuristic was simply reverse-ordering
chronologically. Yes, I meant pid's < 1000, but the number itself had
*nothing* to do with the heuristic, it was simply part of the explanation.
(I had quickly checked where my mingetty's were at, 672-677... never
knew a typo would get me barraged like this :)
