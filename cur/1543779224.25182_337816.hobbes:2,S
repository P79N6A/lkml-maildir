It's not strange.  The numa interface calls mbind, set_mempolicy
and get_mempolicy, between kernel and user, don't deal in zones.
They deal in nodes.
I suspect you should do the same.  I doubt we want to expose
zones to user space here.
I will leave it to Andi to address your questions about memory
pressure on lower numbered nodes when using MPOL_BIND.  I suspect
that for some of the uses you consider here, such as binding to a
set of more than one node, that cpusets will provide capabilities
closer to what you have in mind.
