But we aren't talking about the ABI the kernel uses internally, but about 
what is exposed to user-space via signal handlers.  _That_ part needs to 
be followed, and if it isn't it's a serious problem we somehow have to 
hack around.

That is true.  But it requires updating the kernel to a fixed one if you 
want to run your programs compiled by 4.3 :-/  Not something we'd like to 
demand.
Ciao,
