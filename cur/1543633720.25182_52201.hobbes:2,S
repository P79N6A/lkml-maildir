Interesting idea.  I'd rather have the "hcd framework" layer
manage such stuff than have each of N host controller drivers
trying to do the same thing though ... less likely to turn
into bug heaven.

And that's exactly the problem scenario, since it uses the "automagic
resubmit" model with interrupt transfers.  Each of the HCDs needs to
handle that differently -- different behaviors, different bugs, yeech.
I won't go into it now, but a queued transfer model would work a lot
better.

Right, the alignment stuff is a correctness issue, the consistent
memory issue is a performance concern.  I like to think that 2.5
will have a lot less correctness issues in the USB stack, so it
can start to pay more attention to performance concerns.
