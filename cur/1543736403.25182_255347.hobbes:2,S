btw does that mkinitrd already use 
readlink /sys/block/sda/device/block/device
(which gives
../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:06.0/0000:03:0b.0/host1/1:0:0:0
as output)
the pci path that gives can easily be matched to modules.pcimap to find
the information in case of a PCI device, so at least the table in your
mkinitrd doesn't need to contain PCI devices.....
