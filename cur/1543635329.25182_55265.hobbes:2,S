The system is scsi only.  pre7-jam6 and pre8-jam2 .config's were 
identical.

Based on Andrea'a diff logs, irqbalance appeared in 2.4.19pre10aa3.
There are small differences between the pre10-jam2 and aa irqbalance
patches.  One new datapoint with pre10-jam3:
*Local* Communication latencies in microseconds - smaller is better

kernel                          Pipe    AF/Unix

2.4.19-pre10-jam2                7.877   16.699

2.4.19-rc1-aa1-1g-nio           34.989   52.704
A config difference between pre10-jam2 and pre10-jam3 is:
CONFIG_X86_SFENCE=y	# pre10-jam2
pre10-jam2 was compiled with -Os and pre10-jam3 with -O2.

Quad P3/Xeon 700 mhz with 1MB cache.
