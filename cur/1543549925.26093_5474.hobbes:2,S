Hi,
this patch updates the documentation in Documentation/sound
to reflect the changes that were made in Linux 2.3.
I've also added a NEWS file that contains a very short
descrption of the changes from 2.2 to 2.4 (no, it's not a
ChangeLog) ...

 Documentation for the AD1816(A) sound driver
 ============================================
 
-NOTE: This driver is still EXPERIMENTAL, so don't use it on production
-systems!
-
-
 Installation:
 -------------
 
-To get your AD1816(A) based sound card work, you'll have to enable
-module support ("Enable loadable module support") and support for
-experimental code ("Prompt for development and/or incomplete
-code/drivers") during kernel configuration. Enable "Sound card
-support", "OSS modules support" and "Support for AD1816(A) based cards
-(EXPERIMENTAL)" in the sound configuration menu, too. Be sure, that
-you build "Support for AD1816(A) based cards (EXPERIMENTAL)" as a MODULE,
-otherwise you may run into problems later.
-Now build, install and reboot the new kernel as usual.
-
-Since the AD1816(A) is a P'n'P sound chip you'll usually have to
-configure it using the isapnptools. See isapnptools documentation for
-details on configuring P'n'P cards.
-
-After you have successfully configured the card using isapnp, you may
-load the AD1816 driver using modprobe. A typical modprobe call should
-look like this:
-
-  modprobe ad1816 io=0x530 irq=5 dma=1 dma2=3 ad1816_clockfreq=33000
-
-if your isapnp.conf file looks like this (relevant lines only):
-
- (INT 0 (IRQ 5 (MODE +E)))
- (DMA 0 (CHANNEL 1))
- (DMA 1 (CHANNEL 3))
- (IO 0 (BASE 0x0220))
- (IO 1 (BASE 0x0388))
- (IO 2 (BASE 0x0530))
-
-NOTE: Be sure, that you use the address IO 2 (in our example 0x530) when
-loading the module!
-
-If your setup was correct, you should see the following messages in  
-/var/log/messages (numbers may be different):
-
-Nov  6 17:07:26 tek01 kernel: ad1816_detect(530)
-Nov  6 17:07:26 tek01 kernel: ad1816_detect() - Detected OK
-Nov  6 17:07:26 tek01 kernel: AD1816 Version: 3
-
+To get your AD1816(A) based sound card work, you'll have to enable support for
+experimental code ("Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers")
+and isapnp ("Plug and Play support", "ISA Plug and Play support"). Enable

+It should be automatically detected by the Linux Kernel isapnp support when you

+Linux 2.4 Sound Changes
+2000-September-25
+Christoph Hellwig, <hch@caldera.de>
+
+
+
+=== isapnp support
+
+The Linux 2.4 Kernel does have reliable in-kernel isapnp support.
+Some drivers (sb.o, ad1816.o awe_wave.o) do now support automatically
+detecting and configuring isapnp devices.
+If you have a not yet supported isapnp soundcard, mail me the content
+of '/proc/isapnp' on your system and some information about your card
+and its driver(s) so I can try to get isapnp working for it.
+
+
+
+=== soundcard resources on kernel commandline
+
+Before Linux 2.4 you had to specify the resources for sounddrivers
+statically linked into the kernel at compile time
+(in make config/menuconfig/xconfig). In Linux 2.4 the ressources are
+now specified at the boot-time kernel commandline (e.g. the lilo
+'append=' line or everything that's after the kernel name in grub).
+Read the Configure.help entry for your card for the parameters.
+
+
+=== softoss is gone
+
+In Linux 2.4 the softoss in-kernel software synthesizer is no more aviable.
+Use a user space software synthesizer like timidity instead.
+
+
+
+=== /dev/sndstat and /proc/sound are gone
+
+In older Linux versions those files exported some information about the
+OSS/Free configuration to userspace. In Linux 2.3 they were removed because
+they did not support the growing number of pci soundcards and there were
+some general problems with this interface.
