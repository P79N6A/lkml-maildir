Do the ps/2 mouse and the keyboard work like they did in 2.4 (same /dev
major/minor)?  I tried 2.5 early on but quit because I couldnt see my
input devices.  At the time I posted a note and got some responses, but
it appeared that I would have to change things around such that they
wouldnt work with 2.4 anymore, which I was not willing to do.
Thanks,
Jim
