Hello,
as I boot some times under windows, i have to change my IRQ for my PCI
devices to (all) 9... and all the times I tried to boot that way under linux,
it doesn't boot...
So I haven't tested it that way for ages... and now with 2.4.2-ac7 i booted
without any problem that way:
cat /proc/interrupts                                                     03.03 1:52

  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade

NMI:      27599 
LOC:    3051630

MIS:          0
Is it safe to do it that way?
Thanks you very much,
	Greg
