It shouldn't have broken anything.  The warning happens, but the
function call ends up doing the same thing as it used to - old drivers
will just ignore the new argument. 
It was a necessary step in working ACPI suspend.  Which Patrick has
working - with caveats.  And the fact that Pat happens to work at the
same company I do probably has more to do with the fact that Transmeta
is obviously interested in suspend issues more than most - and not so
much with the fact that he would exert undue influence on me.
