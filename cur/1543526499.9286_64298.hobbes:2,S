	The more FD's your  select() ( or poll() ) system call
	must pass at each syscall, the slower it will be.
	And having more FD's, the more activity changes your
	server process has, e.g. more often you will return
	from poll()/select()..
	You would do well (with less systemcall overhead) by
	running smaller FD sets at more servers.
