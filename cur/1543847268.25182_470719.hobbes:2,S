What happened when you tried it? It would be useful if you could change 
the #undef in these lines:
  53 #undef ATA_DEBUG                /* debugging output */
  54 #undef ATA_VERBOSE_DEBUG        /* yet more debugging output */
in include/linux/libata.h to #define and rebuild and try it then, that 
will spew out a bunch more output and I can see if any reasonable 
looking values are showing up at all. I was capturing this output the 
crude way, booting with vga=6 to get a smaller font and taking a picture 
of the screen :-) Also, maybe post the lspci -v output from the SATA 
controller..
If that doesn't provide any insight, maybe the docs Jeff has provide the 
answer for whether or not the MCP5x/MCP61 controllers have the same 
interface as the CK804/MCP04..
