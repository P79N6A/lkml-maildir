Even idle percentage is quite misleading.  Lots of interrupt
processing gets credited to the idle task and you don't see
it at all with normal accounting tools.
The `subtractive' approach is more accurate.  See how much
processing capacity is left behind when all the foreground
task and interrupt processing is complete.
