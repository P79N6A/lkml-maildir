It definitely would, which is why Dinakar's patch both added a call to
get cpuset_sem earlier in the hot unplug code, as well as removed the
call to get cpuset_sem that was inside the cpuset_cpus_allowed code (as
well as modified the other caller of cpuset_cpus_allowed, the
sched_setaffinity code, to explicitly get cpuset_sem before calling
cpuset_cpus_allowed, since that call no longer acquired cpuset_sem on
its own.
