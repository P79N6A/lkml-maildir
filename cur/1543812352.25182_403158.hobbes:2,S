That breaks git-bisect.

It's also much easier to read a series of patches if each patch depends
only on the previous patches.  Then if I want to verify that they don't
break anything, I just need to read them through in order and verify
that each one is correct.
If earlier patches depend on later patches, then I may not be able to
verify correctness until I've read and understand the whole series,
which defeats somewhat the purpose of splitting up the patches.  Though
the above example wouldn't really be a problem.
And of course it seems rather silly to complain about splitting out a
function before adding the new caller.
