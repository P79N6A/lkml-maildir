btw., even if it turns out to be the wrong commit, you sure poked in the 
right general area. This is one of the reoccuring problems with git 
bisection: a small mistake near the end of a long bisection session can 
point to the wrong commit. Especially with more sporadic failure modes 
it can be quite a challenge.
