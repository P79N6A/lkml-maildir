Makes sense.

Well it depends on the drive id data but assuming the defaults yes

The libata code does the following:
        if (t->active + t->recover < t->cycle) {
                t->active += (t->cycle - (t->active + t->recover)) / 2;
                t->recover = t->cycle - t->active;
        }
which probably means for 16MHz you don't have enough resolution to be sure
you'll error in this direction in all cases. If so you just need to try
adding
	if (t->active + t->recover > t->cycle)
		t->cycle = t->active + t->recover
to stretch the cycle time to fit the resolution as well.
And we should get this tested/fixed by someone seeing the problem, before
and instead of putting hacks/notes in drivers that may then get lost
