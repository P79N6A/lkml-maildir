Module loading complains in 2.6.5-bk1 and bk2 with an
  "Invalid module format" error message.
2.6.5 loads the Cisco VPN module ok.
Tried upgrading my old module-init-tools to 3.0, still no go.
Tried patching Makefile with Sam Ravnborg's latest kbuild fix,
  still no go.
Currently loaded the Cisco VPN module built under 2.6.5 into
  a 2.6.5-bk2 kernel; this works.
Please CC: me on replies since I'm not on the list... thanks
  in advance ! Ciao,
