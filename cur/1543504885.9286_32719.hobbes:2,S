Unfortunately, ext2 has the same problem, so this cannot be ignored.

I never thought about abusing POSIX locks for this. I thought about
an independant, lightweigth collision list. The lock structure
could lie on the stack, I think it could be quite efficient.
But the main problem is the overhead, but OTHO acquiring i_sem
for write operations would kill performance for large databases.
