No, quite the opposite.  I'm arguing that the wrappers in mthca do
legitimately belong in a device driver, since they encapsulate
device-specific knowledge about what serialization suffices when an
atomic __raw_writeq() is not available.

Yes, that's an unfortunate feature of the ipath hardware that
apparently makes it impossible to drive on a generic 32-bit architecture.
So perhaps writeq()/__raw_writeq() need to be defined to generate a
single bus cycle to the extent that makes sense.  Which would mean
that it's not possible to implement on all architectures.
