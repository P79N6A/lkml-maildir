Yes, I have, but that's not what I was driving at.  The question is, what do 
you think is the difference between :
(a) pressing "suspend" and walking away, while being assured that suspend will 
complete and leave the system ... suspended, until someone triggers a "resume"
and
(b) pressing "suspend" and walking away, while allowing the possibility that 
someone might interrupt the suspend operation.
??
Personally, I don't see any difference.
