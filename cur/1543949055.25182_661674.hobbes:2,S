High-performance graphics developers are pretty much the last people on 
earth I want to see writing code that calls init_mm.  These people 
patent their bugs, rather than fixing them, when they turn out to make 
things go a little faster and generate "mostly correct" results.  I 
think we have a lot to teach them about kernel driver development, 
including how to get by without init_mm being exported.
