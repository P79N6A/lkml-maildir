I had the same problem, so i added those devfsd lines to my config
files, and everything's peachy now.  I'm thinking it's a debian problem,
cause everything was fine till I ran a dist-upgrade.  I didn't notice it
right away, and I did random kernel stuff before I did notice it.  Ian,
which debian are you running, I'm using sid.
