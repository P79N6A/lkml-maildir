Hello there,
Does anyone know the cause and a potential fix for the following
error messages reported in syslogd by my eepro100 card?
The machine is running under heavy CPU + memory + network load.
It seems that the card has problems finding the required resources.
Is there a way to "guarantee" that the card will have the necessary
resources even at high loads?
I'm using kernel version 2.2.14.
Thank you,
Sincerely
Kostas Nikoloudakis
