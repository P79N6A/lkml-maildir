Hmm... maybe it has something to do with ACPI ? Could you try booting the 
kernel after a warm reboot with ACPI disabled ?
An other thing I can think about is that a driver does odd things due to the 
fact that the hardware isn't reinitialized completely. See dmesg what driver 
comes after that serial driver and disable the serial driver and / or the 
other driver. See if this helps.
