Yeah.  In the bootwrapper.

Sure, if you *can* get a fix for the firmware.  Until every
user has this update, fixing it in the kernel wrapper helps
users.

Sure, the bootloader can do it too, but then we need to fix
every bootloader that's used with Linux on this platform.
Maybe that's just one, that would make things simple :-)

This is just pragmatics: Linux needs the workaround -> Linux
implements the workaround.  Sure it is not a _proper_ fix, but
a correctly implemented workaround "fixes" it for all users,
forever.

But it's something every user has to do separately.

That's hardly the only reason.  But yeah, that's one way to
implement the workaround, but _we_ (the Linux community) cannot
do it like that (easily) for all users.
