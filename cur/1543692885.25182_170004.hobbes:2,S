Oh well, I thought it was better to slowly deconstruct the thing, started
sending, my feedback was that the trees are being pulled by Linus, so
everything seems to be allright, if Linus merged all of micro changesets as one
changeset I'd understand that as "stop sending as separate changesets, send me
just one", and I'd do just that, Linus?
