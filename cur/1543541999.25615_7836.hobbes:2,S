This is what DB2 V7.1 (Personal) does if I try to use sct's raw devices:
umask(0)                                = 022
open("/dev/raw8", O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0600) = 73
umask(022)                              = 0
fstat(73, {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0660, st_rdev=makedev(162, 8), ...}) = 0
ioctl(73, BLKGETSIZE, 0xbfff7ee4)       = -1 ENOTTY (Inappropriate ioctl
for device)
(Using /dev/sda8 fails because it is not a character device).
I looked into the code and realized that there is no ioctl handler.
Is this done on purpose or should I just add it from the blk/sector
size arrays ?
