yep. it is serious. we've been begging for knfsd to be updated to the
most /current/ code for quite a while a now. I searched the archives
and i found a post of mine asking alan to consider an NFS patch sync
for 2.2.something - over a year ago. 
standard linux NFS is dreadful and unstable, and that's just between
linux machines. other unixen as clients? don't even try.
