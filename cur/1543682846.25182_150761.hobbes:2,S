I send this a few days ago, but it seems to have gone by unnoticed, so
here it is again.
My Netgear FA120 USB2 ethernet adaptor isn't working properly with
Linux 2.6.0-test1.  First off, I had to modify it slightly (patch
below) to make it work at all with USB2.  Now I can send data at the
full expected speed (~11 MB/s).  The problem is that receiving is only
200 kb/s.  This is obviously annoying.  For the record, it works
perfectly with 2.4.21-pre5 and ax8817x.c version 0.9.7.  Any ideas?
