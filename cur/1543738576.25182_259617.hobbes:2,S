Don't mess with the hardware on your own! That's almost always a bug and
will cost you any later portability. Instead, just use the interface
Please use the userspace parport driver interface (provided by
ppdev.ko). Additionally it'll give you full portability to non-PC
hardware for free:-)

Not all that right:-)  You access the hardware directly which is wrong.
Use the ppdev interface instead.
I've just put the program online
(
http://lug-owl.de/~jbglaw/software/steckdose/steckdose.c
) which
drives my relay box (basically a shift register + relay driver).
I guess the parport locking code isn't yet correct, but it should give
you a start to using ppdev...
