Subject: lse conference switched to IRC to discuss 2.6 must-fix list
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/5/12/281

Major change this week only, please note!
Due to complaints about the restrictions of a phone conference
Andrew and I have decided to move the 2.6 must-fix discussion to irc.
The server we will use is: irc.oftc.net 
 (NOT irc.freenode.net as previously stated)
The channel is: #lse
If you need help getting started with irc see this helpful 
site at: 
http://irchelp.org
 or feel free to send me email for help.
The agenda and time remain the same:
	LSE Tech IRC meeting Wednesday May 14
Andrew Morton: The 2.6 must fix list.
