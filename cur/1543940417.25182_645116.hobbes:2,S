Its on a per-task basis when the task elects SCHED_FIFO/RR/BATCH/OTHER, etc.  If the task is on a particular RQ, the RQ operates under the policy of that class.  There are some cases where the RQ consults the policy of all classes, but they are still influenced by whether there are actual tasks running within the scope of the current cpuset (or root-domain).

I think so, yes.  But I will give the disclaimer that I don't fully understand your world ;)
You could certainly create a group of cpus with homogeneous policy by creating a cpuset with only tasks of a single class as members.  But likewise, if you populate a cpuset with tasks from mixed classes, you have mixed balance policy affecting those cpus.

IMHO it works well the way it is:  The user selects the class for a particular task using sched_setscheduler(), and they select the cpuset (or inherit it) that defines its execution scope.  If that scope has balancing enabled, the policy for the member classes is in effect.
(on this topic, note that I do not know if the RT-balancer will respect the cpuset concept of "balance-enabled" anyway.  That might have to be fixed)
Again, the disclaimer that I do not have expertise in your area, so perhaps this is naive.
