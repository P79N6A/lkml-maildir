Subject: duplicate entries in rtl8129 driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

	Both linux-2.4.0-test12-pre6/drivers/net/rtl8129.c and
Don Becker's version at ftp.sycld.com appear to have identical
PCI device ID and vendor ID values for these two cards:
		SMC1211TX EZCard 10/100 (RealTek RTL8139)
		Accton MPX5030 (RealTek RTL8139)
	So, I do not see how the latter entry in pci_tbl is ever
matched.  I think the result would be that users of either card
will be told that they have an SMC1211TX EZCard 10/100.  I suggest
deleting the latter entry and combine its label into the previous
one, so it will be described as:
	SMC1211TX EZCard 10/100 or Accton MPX5030 (RealTek RTL8139)
	Comments?
