Hi David,

A *conditional* store should no be a problem.
However the funny trick of doing this conditional add (implemented with
unconditional store), is what is going to cause breakage.
On the CPUs where predicated instructions are a big win, I'd expect
they should also implement a conditional store for use here. However
they might be slower than an unconditional store (eg. x86's cmov),
and in those cases, gcc might just do the non-conditional store.

This is not just a question of data that you were going to use anyway.
gcc generates memory accesses to locations that would never be accessed
Even stores. It is basically impossible to say that this is a real
performance win. Even on single threaded code: consider that cache
misses take the vast majority of time in many loads, which gives a
little hint that maybe it's a bad idea to do this ;)

I'd never say the optimisation would always be useless. But it's a nasty
thing to have on by default, and apparently even with no good way to
supress it even if we want to.

Either way, I think we really need a way to turn it off for Linux.
