Hi David,
We do want improved latency, but with reasonable memory usage. This is
a soft real-time system. At the moment the memory usage is far too high in
our application.
With 20 threads runing the system will lock 160MBytes of memory just for stack
space (8 MBytes each), although the application probably only needs 2MByte in
total.
We can reduce the maximum stack size per thread, but then if a thread
increases its stack size beyond this the application will crash with a
segment fault, not good ...
For our use, mapping in physical memory as required for a growing stack would be
a good compromise between latency and memory usage. Once the system has run the
worker threads for a short time all of the needed stack memory will be locked in
and latency will be controlled. If a thread needs more memory for stack in a particular
instance, there will be a latency hit but this would be acceptable and
much better than a crash.
