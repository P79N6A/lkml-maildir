1) I abandoned my idea because I forgot LOADLIN, and because it would
be i386 only.
2) "Fast" reboot means that we could modify sys_reboot(): instead of
forcing a cold boot, we could reload lilo.
This had nothing to do with oops - these where 2 independant ideas.
Sorry, this was just a wild idea, I should have thought about it 
a bit longer.
But I do think that as soon as add more semaphores to the  filesystem
and if we implement journaling for ext[2,3], then we must also modify
the oops-logging implementation.
a) restart immediately (at least a compile option)
	transaction tracked systems have no problems with crashes,
	but they can't handle unreliable execution.
b) store the oops report without touching VFS.
