Well, I guess I should chip in here with the rather amusing fact that
2.4.4 is the first kernel *not* to do this to me...  ;-)
I am, of course, glad to help out testing stuff if needed.  My card is
also a LinkSys LNE100TX v4.1, which the tulip driver identifies as an
ADMtek Comet rev 17 (although somebody told me it's really a Centaur).
