Well, there'd need to be an else doing a put_page(), too.
Looks like the fundamental problem is that a list is not a suitable
data structure for gathering here, since it's not truly local.  We
should probably change it to a small array, like in the normal tlb
gather structure.  If we run out of space we can force the tlb flush
and keep going.
Or we could just give up on lazy tlb flush for hugepages.
