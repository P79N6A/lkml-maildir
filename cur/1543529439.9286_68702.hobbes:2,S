Subject: 2.3.51 oops & crash

I just had a freshly-compiled 2.3.51 oops and subsequently lock the
system hard. At the moment I was in X (Xfree86 4.0, MGA driver, who by 
the way messes up the font on the console, so one needs to run
consolechars -d after switching to console) and the nightly backup had
just kicked in so there was network and SCSI activity. I saw the oops
message scroll by in an xconsole before the system locked up, but
unfortunately it didn't make it to disk :( Uptime was about 30 minutes
when this happened. I can try and reproduce the crash if peoeple are
interested.
System in question:
Dual PII, SMP kernel,
Intel 440BX, IDE disks
Adaptec AHA2940UW, exabyte tape streamer
Realtec ne2k-pci NIC
Matrox G400 graphics card
