    Yes, it is.  What remains is to do two things:  (a) write the code,
    and (b) survive the wall of flame.    If you write the code (a
    single shim module that has to navigate the constant rewriting of
    the lkm interfaces is a lot easier to maintain than the
    approximately 500 drivers that have to navigate the same thing or
    die) and it doesn't immediately convert kernels into gravel, it may
    be useful enough so that it won't need to be in the baseline kernel
    to survive (I'd certainly like to see it so I could use some newer
    device drivers in 2.0.28 while waiting for 3.0 to appear.)  In any
    case, alas, talking about it here will cause a devfs-sized war and
    (just like with devfs) nothing else.
