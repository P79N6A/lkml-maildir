I've previously found that vim's "cindent" mode is better than
"smartindent", which is better than "autoindent".  However, as of vim
6.3 autoindent seems to be fairly well off; the following does TRT:
`int SPC foo() RET { RET C-t int SPC x; RET RET foo(); RET'
(leaving an empty line between "int x;" and "foo();").  However, the
following does leave a line matching /^ +$/ even in smartindent and
cindent modes:
`int SPC foo() RET { RET int SPC x; RET SPC BS bar(); RET'
that is, if you edit the autoindented line before leaving it blank, then
vim 6.3 will not remove the autoindent spaces when you leave the line.
