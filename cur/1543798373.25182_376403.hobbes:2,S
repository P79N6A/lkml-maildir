feel free to spend your time on it, you seem to consider it well spent
time. A lot of us don't, so we're not going to spend our time on it....

a stable API is more rigid, that is not and can't be a misconception.

in practice it doesn't. The kernel drivers are GPL, and API changes when
needed just happen, all callers are fixed. The alternative would be a
"crooked" API which needs workarounds on both sides. No thanks.

I think Linux proves you wrong (and a bit of a troll to be honest ;)
Anyway, it's an open system, if you think something should happen... you
can make it happen by contributing and then defending it. If it's the
right thing, it'll then happen.
