Actually, Coda is not dead, there is still quite a bit of activity. It
is just seems slow on the kernel side because we actually have kernel
modules for various operating systems, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Windows 9x,
Windows NT/2000/XP, Solaris, and recently MacOS/Darwin. As a result we
are quite conservative as far as any significant changes in the
kernel-userspace interface.
