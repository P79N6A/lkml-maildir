Two versus one.  It's democracy.  :-)

I can't fully understand the above paragraph.  Please elaborate.

I don't really know.  AFAICT, things should work without those flushes.
 ATA devices are often crappy and drivers are built to deal with those
kinds of spurious interrupts while frozen.  And, yes, having it never
hurts.  I'm just not quite sure what they guarantee.  IRQ signals are
asynchronous to IOs, so flushing IO doesn't guarantee immediate IRQ
quiescence.
If you leave those flushes, that makes it two versus two.  Universe will
be in balance.  :-)
