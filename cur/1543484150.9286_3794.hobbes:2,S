    Ctrl-scroll shows you all processes running, their pids, their child
    processes, and any sibling processes, and stack info and such.
    shift-scroll shows you memory, and swap info.
    Is there a way to disable this feature at compile time, or would I have to
    edit source somewhere?
Read loadkeys(1), possibly also the Kbd FAQ in case you want
to replace defkeymap already at compile time.
