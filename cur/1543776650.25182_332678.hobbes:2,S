Subject: [PATCH] Add ENOSYS into sys_io_cancel
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Other than few exceptions (e.g. usb/gadget), none of
the current filesystems and/or drivers that has
io_cancel implemented (kiocb->ki_cancel left with
NULL). However, the io_cancel() system call
(sys_io_cancel) somehow universally sets return code
to -EAGAIN. This gives us a false impression that
io_cancel() is supported (implemented) but just never
works - would appreciate if this patch is taken.
-- s.w.
