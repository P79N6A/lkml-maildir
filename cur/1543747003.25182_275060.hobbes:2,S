Maybe you can give a 2.4.27'er kernel a try.

I have the same impression after reading drivers/block/scsi_ioctl.c . I
think you will need root permission to send this command, RW-Permission
for the device file is not enough! Did you try this as root?
But I'm wondering that scsi_ioctl.c comes into play, because It's a
ATAPI-Device. Isn't it? Do you use the scsi emulation? If so please try
without.

No this will definitively not solve this issue. I will try to check this
in the kernel, but because I'm not a kernel developer I will CC Jens
Axboe. Maybe he can help?
Kind Regards,
