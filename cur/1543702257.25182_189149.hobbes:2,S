Let's see.
If it's in userspace, then setup your debug area in an area your system
doesn't depend on, and wham, the hang won't affect the entire system anymore.
Also, if you have /home automounted then it only affects the users on /home,
and root's $home should be /home...
Though, you can debug in-kernel code with UML...
