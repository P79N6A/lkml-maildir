There's no evidence of any problems ever being caused by this code.
It's been there for years.

It is critical functionality for larger machines because vmap()/vunmap()
really does suck in terms of scalability.

Could vmap()/vunmap() take references to the pages that are
mapped? That way delaying the unmap would also delay the freeing
of the pages and hence we'd have no problems with the pages
being reused before the mapping is torn down. That'd work for
Xen even with XFS's lazy unmapping scheme, and would allow
Nick's more advanced methods to work as well....
Cheers,
Dave.
