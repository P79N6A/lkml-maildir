Looking at the code - On SMP, the woken up task will be always scheduled on a 
CPU other than the one executing the caller, in which case caller of 
wake_up() is not pre-empted. On UP, it just sets need_resched (different than 
calling schedule() ) in which case the caller of wake_up() will be 
rescheduled only when appropriate, when it is safe to preempt it.
