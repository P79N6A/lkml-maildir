Ah, right, that was the detail... all this lumpy reclaim is useless for
atomic allocations. And with SLUB using higher order pages, atomic !0
order allocations will be very very common.
One I can remember was:
  add_to_page_cache()
    radix_tree_insert()
      radix_tree_node_alloc()
        kmem_cache_alloc()
which is an atomic callsite.
Which leaves us in a situation where we can load pages, because there is
free memory, but can't manage to allocate memory to track them..
