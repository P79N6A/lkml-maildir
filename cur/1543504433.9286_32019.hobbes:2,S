Doesn't this strike you as a bit ugly?  If EVERYTHING is using the same
pid, then why not make getpid() use it as well, and then add a system call
to get the thread ID.  It's NOT an appreciable amount of extra kernel
code, and it makes everything a lot more consistent.  Keeping the kernel
small is an admirable goal, but not if it means inventing completely
pointless and arbitrary behavior to eliminate a few lines of kernel code.
Sometimes the kernel is the right place for implementing certain behavior,
especially when that behavior changes the common conception of how the
kernel performs its tasks.
