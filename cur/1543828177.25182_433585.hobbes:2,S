Can we get back to the question of need? And from there, work out what
features are wanted.
IMHO, having containers try to virtualise all resources (memory, pagecache,
slab cache, CPU, disk/network IO...) seems insane: we may just as well use
virtualisation.
So, from my POV, I would like to be convinced of the need for this first.
I would really love to be able to keep core kernel simple and fast even if
it means edge cases might need to use a slightly different solution.
