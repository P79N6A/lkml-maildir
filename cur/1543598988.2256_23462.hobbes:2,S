Fully agreed, but remember that when you reach the point
where the readahead windows are pushing each other out
you'll be off even worse.
I guess in the long run we should have automatic collapse
of the readahead window when we find that readahead window
thrashing is going on, in the short term I think it is
enough to have the maximum readahead size tunable in /proc,
like what is happening in the -ac kernels.
regards,
Rik
