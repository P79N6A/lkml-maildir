I've certainly tortured it a bit, with no problems.

| and share the prof_data.
Using this (above) profiling method shouldn't be very intrusive.
(I.e., need to reboot, but not patch and build a kernel.)
Here's another thing you could do, Scott.  This patch is against
2.4.19-pre2 but probably will apply to several versions of 2.4.x
that do *not* have the block-highmem patch applied.
This patch adds bounce IO and bounce swap IO statistics
to /proc/stat .
It also prints out a message about which device is using (causing)
bounce IO.  This message could easily become excessive, so if you
try this, feel free to disable that part of the patch.
bounce IO stats for block-highmem will require a different patch,
but Jens has helped me on that a bit, and I'll post it after some
more testing.
Any updated news from you on this issue, Scott?
