I took a picture of it, looks like the backtrace is:
NULL pointer dereference at 024
EIP:dmar_table_init+0x11
intel_iommu_init+0x30
pci_iommu_init+0xe
kernel_init+0x16e
Presumably something is NULL in dmar_table_init that wasn't expected to 
be.. I would guess it likely crashes on any system without an Intel 
IOMMU in it.
