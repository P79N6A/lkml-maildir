It is not pretty, but I have no choice. See include/asm-x86_64/pda.h on what I 
have currently. Supporting the address in the same macro would 
double to overhead of accesing it.

Nope, the segment register has to stay for other reasons, and it would
be a shame to not use it for cpu data too.
I don't see it as that bad. Is it really that difficult to write _ptr
if you want the address? You can also write _noptr or _direct or whatever
if you don't want the address if you prefer that, but I want to keep
the option to do direct access even for generic code.
