doc-patch against -rc2-mm1 attached.

initially the rate of false positives is like 90%, so there would only
be annoyance coming out of this patch. Arch maintainers should have the
ability to enable this on their own pace i think. Once the majority of 
arches have enabled this we can force it on for all architectures.
