Not exactly. You can as easily remove all Andre's checks via /dev/kmem.
Program will be slightly bigger but not much.

You CAN edit dirictiries directly (on unmounted system). It's prohibeted for
mounted system by speed reason, not by security reason. About ring 0... You
CAN reduce root power with capabilities. And you CAN forbid this ioctl as well.
Via /proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound ...

 1. We can not switch it off while retaining raw hardware access.
 2. We can make it inaccessible for someone without CAP_SYS_RAW by two lines
patch instead of 60K patch.

I don't as well but we have choice.

Huh ? You just need to grep over /dev/kmem and replace few bytes there.
Not such a big deal.

See above.

It's IMPOSSIBLE as long as "root is god". And if root was retired from gods
via /proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound it's impossible at all and you do not need
this patch for that.
