The user will see that he can't disable certain options.
This is basically the same problem as with other dependencies, if the user 
selects an option other options may become visible. There is no direct 
information, how the config option depend on each other (except xconfig 
offers that as a debug option).

Of course the same can be done with normal dependencies, but this new 
option offers more flexibility. Important options don't have to be hidden 
away behind a lot of dependencies. I'm aware that this can be abused, so I 
have to watch a bit how it will be used.
