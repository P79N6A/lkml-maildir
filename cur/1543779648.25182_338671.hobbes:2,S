The thing is, I'm tracking how long the task is running in the kernel
without doing a schedule.  That's actually easy, but I don't want to
count when the task is in userspace. The per-arch is only updating so
that we don't count user space, otherwise the count could be in the
task_struct.  If there is an arch-independent way to tell if a task is
running in user-space or kernel when an interrupt goes off then I would
use it.  The per arch is actually easy, and I would write it, but I
don't have the hardware now to test it.  I could at least do PPC and
MIPS since I'm quite familiar with both, but I don't currently have a
cross compiler to compile it.
I understand your point, I would really prefer an arch independent
solution, but the timestamp from current just wont cut it.  Have another
idea, I'm all open for it.
So far, what I submitted works with no know side-effects except that it
is a per-arch patch, which does suck.
