Yenta patch is still needed (it will be included in 2.6.13.3).

These errors most likely mean that there are no interrupts form PCI
devices in the docking station. I'd suppose that massively changed bus
numbers make ACPI confused wrt interrupt routing, but all relevant IRQs
are exactly the same as without "assign-busses", so I'm puzzled...

At the moment I can only think of something like this: the PCIE-to-PCI bridge
(Intel 6702PXH) in your docking station also has IOxAPIC as PCI function #1,
but its config space is turned off by BIOS for some reason. However, its MMIO
registers are still present somewhere in PCI address space - we just don't
know where.
So there is a small possibility that we have accidentally stepped on them
and destroyed IRQ routing setup writing to MMIO registers of totally
unrelated device.
Please test this patch, though chances that it helps are quite small...
In either case lspci output will be useful.
Ivan.
