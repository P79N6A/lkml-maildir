Hmm...yes, I think that change to the CodingStyle makes sense. But I
guess the question is whether the old code "significantly increases
readability" and whether the new code "hides information".
I don't think so, but I don't feel all that strongly about it. I'd
actually prefer if we used at_writel() and at_readl() throughout the
code and killed those UART_PUT/UART_GET macros.
