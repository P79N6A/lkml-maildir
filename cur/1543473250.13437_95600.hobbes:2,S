Indeed it appears make xconfig is broken, as it also does not define ANY of the
new MEM config options. 
These show up in make config and make menuconfig but not in xconfig:
CONFIG_MEM_STD=y
# CONFIG_MEM_ENT is not set
# CONFIG_MEM_SPECIAL is not set
(and of course the problem with CONFIG_MAX_MEMSIZE already being discussed.)
