Heh.  UUID's don't have to be readable; just universally unique.  Code
on the other hand should be readable.   :-)
If you want something more readable, you could print the MAC address
and boot time.  Of course some crazy people seem to think leaking the
MAC address will somehow be a privacy violation.  And printing a
random UUID is a lot simpler....
