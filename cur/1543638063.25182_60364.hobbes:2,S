I am interested in this ntfs report. Which way round was the loopback file? 
I.e. did you mount: mount -t ntfs -o loop somefile_on_a_non_ntfs_partition 
or did you mount: mount -t some_file_system -o loop 
somefile_on_an_ntfs_partion?
Can you send me the errors produced? If there is an oops, please decode and 
send it, too.
Also it may be useful to have the debug output from ntfs (depending on what 
the errors/oops say - they may be sufficient to pinpoint the problem), i.e. 
enable debugging when configuring the kernel, and then as root do: echo 1 > 
/proc/sys/fs/ntfs-debug. Note this will absolutely flood you with debug 
output so the system will run slow as hell... So it is best to only enable 
debug messages just before the error occurs if that is possible.
Thanks,
         Anton
