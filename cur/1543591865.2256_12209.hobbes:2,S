If you've got side channels that are of a packet nature (aka commands),
then they can all happily coexist on one device. If you've got channels
that are streams or intended for mmap, those ought to be different
devices.

Hmmm.. I suspect there's a permission issue lurking here anyway. It's
probably valid to want to give out raw partition access, say to a
database user, but not to give out permission to fiddle with the
underlying drive.
