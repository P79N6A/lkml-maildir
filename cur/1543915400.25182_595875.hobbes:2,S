Hmmmm. I disagree its a standard practice. I thought the whole point of
make oldconfig was to give you just the delta in configuration options
and was targeted at manual review?
Also how many people are building there own kernels these days?
Expanding on what I said in the original e-mail those who are likely to
care "CAN TURN IT OFF". Those who care about such things should be
REVIEWING CHANGES anyway. Thats what I do when looking at building
custom kernels. What changed that makes me want to move to a new version?
I generally try to stick with the distro kernel when possible, but part
of being an early and aggressive adopter of virtualization technology
involves running non distro kernels and patches.
Most people don't really care.

Actually if I understand the functionality of paravirt correctly that is
not correct. I believe that will turn on the paravirt bits which allow
it to run under things such as VMI or Xen.

Again you need to think about the target audience here. A distro kernel
you don't have to worry about this stuff. A user compiling there own
kernel should already be able to handle this.

Well it's bad taste for you (one person). Taste is highly subjective. So
be careful in making broad ranging statements like this. :)
