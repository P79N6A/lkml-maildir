Hi,
Someone asked me about a tool like this and I didn't know of one,
so I made this little script.
'patchview' merges a patch file and a source tree to a set of
temporary modified files.  This enables better patch (re)viewing
and more viewable context.  (hopefully)
Are there already other tools that do something similar to this?
(other than SCMs)
The patchview script is here:
  
http://www.xenotime.net/linux/scripts/patchview
usage: patchview [-f] patchfile srctree
  -f : force tkdiff even if 'patch' has errors
It uses (requires) lsdiff (from patchutils) and tkdiff.
patchutils:

tkdiff:
