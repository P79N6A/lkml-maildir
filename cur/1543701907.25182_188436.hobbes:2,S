It is psmouse.proto=imps if psmouse is built in the kernel and proto=imps
if psmouse is compiled as a module. I mentioned only the first form because
I assumed that most people have it built-in.
Generally with the module_param macros kernel parameters have a prefix
in form of "module_name." if module is built into the kernel.
