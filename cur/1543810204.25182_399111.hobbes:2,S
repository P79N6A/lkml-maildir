Hello,
We have an issue on ia64 box. It is easy triggerable 'kernel unaligned access' 
in sk_run_filter:
         ptr = load_pointer(skb, k, 4, &tmp);
         if (ptr != NULL) {
                  A = ntohl(*(u32 *)ptr); << here
                  continue;
         }
due to 'k' is coming from userspace it can be easy triggered, e.g.:
[root@node1 ~]# tcpdump -i eth0 'ip[1:2]=0'
Could you advise how to fix this?

Thanks,
Dmitry.
