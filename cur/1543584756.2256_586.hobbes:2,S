Personally speaking, I wish sched_yield() API was like so:
int sched_yield(pid_t pid);
The pid argument would be advisory, of course, the kernel doesn't have to
honor it.
This would allow the thread wanting to acquire the spinlock to yield
specifically to the thread holding the lock (assuming the pid of the lock
holder was stored in the spinlock...) In fact, the the original lock owner
could in theory yield back to the threading wanting to acquire the lock.
Feedback from the scheduling gurus would be appreciated.
Thanks,
davez
