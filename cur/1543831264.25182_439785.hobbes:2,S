Indeed.  The stuff that have been moved to userspace in the first cut of 
klibc are stuff which can largely be tested independently, usually just 
from the normal command line.  This is incredibly powerful, but it is 
not -- and shouldn't be -- universally applied just because it can; it 
should be applied if and when it makes sense.

I have my own share of debugging shared kernel space/user space 
applications, mainly autofs, and if done properly, it can be quite sane. 
  If done *improperly*, it's a nightmare.  Personally, I find that if 
one can:
- Run something as a separate component in userspace, and/or
- Can leverage strace(1) to get more insight
then one can usually get a lot of debugging help.  Otherwise, probably not.
