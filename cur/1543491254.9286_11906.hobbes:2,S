Subject: 2.2.4 breaks my IDE cdrom ?

  I compiled and installed 2.2.4 and now I can't see my IDE cdrom.
It detects it at boot time, but when I go to mount anything:
{0}:dogbert:/home/nomad>mount /cdrom
mount: the kernel does not recognize /dev/hda as a block device
       (maybe `insmod driver'?)
/dev/hda is my cdrom as I'm all SCSI.
{0}:dogbert:/home/nomad>cat /proc/devices 
Character devices:
  1 mem
  2 pty
  3 ttyp
  4 ttyS
  5 cua
  7 vcs
 10 misc
 14 OSS
 21 sg
119 vmnet
128 ptm

Block devices:
  2 fd
