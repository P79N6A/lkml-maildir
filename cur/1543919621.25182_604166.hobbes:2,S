The thing I'm worried about is that we pushed off a rt task that is higher
in prio than another rt task on another cpu, and we'll cause a bunch of
rt task bouncing.  That is what I'm trying to avoid.
BTW, my logging has showed that I have yet to hit a 2cd try (but I admit,
this is a very limited test set).
