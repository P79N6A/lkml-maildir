You're wrong.  regparm(0) attribute tells GCC to pass all arguments
on the stack.  Also function argument passing (the only thing this
attribute controls) is completely orthogonal to whether a function may
modify global variables or not.
__attribute__((const)) functions are not allowed to write nor read
global memory, __attribute__((pure)) functions are not allowed to
write global memory and all other functions are allowed to both
read and write global memory.
As schedule is neither const nor pure, the compiler must assume
a global variable can be changed by schedule().
