The idea is to just have the apic timers roughly at the same times + some fixed
offset as the main timer.  Otherwise e.g. add_timer could jitter up to a jiffie
regarding the jiffies counter. But long term drift will destroy the synchronization 
anyways.
I guess i'll send it in anyways for .23; it would be too risky to change anything 
radical in this area that late. Then later it can be revisited.
