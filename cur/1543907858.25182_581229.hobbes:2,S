beats me.  CONFIG_KVM doesn't get set.  But it seems that kconfig wants
to do error-checking on that item anyway.
btw, testing of Kconfig can be done for any architecture without
installation of a toolchain for that architecture.  Set $ARCH and run
mrproper then use menuconfig/oldconfig/allmodconfig/allconfig as usual.
Judging by the number of Kconfig problem I see, this is a big secret ;)
