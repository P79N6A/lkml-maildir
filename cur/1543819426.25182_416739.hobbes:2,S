With kdb some slowdown is expected.
But just going through kprobes shouldn't be that slow. I guess
there would be optimization potential there.
Do you have finer grained profiling what is actually slow?

Still sounds far too much for what is essentially a call + load + test + return
Where is that overhead comming from?  I know IA64 doesn't like indirect
calls, but there shouldn't any be there for this case.
