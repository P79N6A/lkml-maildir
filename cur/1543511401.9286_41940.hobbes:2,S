	I exited the chroot environment and tried to remove the pts directory.
	This pts filesystem returned the error "file not found" - is this to
	be expected? This file not found error confused rm, which entered an
	infinite loop (perhaps I should file a bug report against rm?)
The first is a kernel bug, the second an rm bug.
Clearly, you already submitted a kernel bug report. I submitted a patch.
It is a good idea also to submit an rm bug report.
	Is it a bug in the pts filesystem that it returns file not found? /proc
	does the same thing too, so it is probably normal (but still strange).
Yes, it is the VFS code, not the individual filesystems.
