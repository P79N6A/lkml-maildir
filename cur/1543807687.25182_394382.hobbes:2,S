SIGH.  In your last patch submission you had it right, but Intel has yet 
again regressed in patch submission form.
Your fixes will be expedited if they can be applied by script, and then 
quickly whisked upstream to Linus/Andrew.  This one had to be applied by 
hand (so yes, its applied) for several reasons:
* Unreviewable in mail reader, due to MIME type application/octet-stream.
* In general, never use MIME (attachments), they decrease the audience 
that can easily review your patch.
* Your patch's description and signed-off-by were buried inside the 
octet-stream attachment.
* Please review 
http://linux.yyz.us/patch-format.html
  (I probably 
should add MIME admonitions to that)
