I have the feeling that the filesystems' use of lots of function 
pointers will add a large amount of complexity to whatever programming 
any checker would require.  Bill Irwin and I were discussing it and we 
have ways of getting around most of them, but there are _lots_ of 
special cases.
   "Proving" correctness would obviously be ideal, but in an imperfect 
world, what are your feelings on a runtime system for detecting 
"magical/bad" BKL use?  I'm not proposing my kludgy "printk if you're 
bad" stuff, but something with much less impact.  I would like to do 
something somewhat like profile=2.  During each lock_kernel(), the 
program counter (any maybe more) could be stored in an internal kernel 
structure and retrieved later via a /proc file, just like readprofile. 
    This wouldn't have intrusive printk messages, and would be able to 
be activated by either a command-line parameter, or something else in 
/proc.  If we had this in our development kernel, interested 
developers could pay attention to the output, while the normal kernel 
developer could simply ignore it.

I also wonder how it handles things like kmalloc(), which can block 
depending on arguments.
