If you can figure out which paths this goes through because it completely 
locks up right before printing 'scsi: device offlined' on 2.5.63. I 
can't provide much more information at present.
scsi1 : QLogic ISP1020 SCSI on PCI bus 04 device 70 irq 89 MEM base 0xf8a18000
scsi: Device offlined - not ready or command retry failed after error recovery: host 1 channel 0 id 0 lun 0
scsi: Device offlined - not ready or command retry failed after error recovery: host 1 channel 0 id 1 lun 0
