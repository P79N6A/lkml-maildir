I know that anon_hash_chain has gone away in 2.6 because
the inodes for special filesystems like sockfs, pipefs,
etc are now associated with a superblock. Should these
inodes have i_hash linked into the inode hashtable then?
It appears in 2.4 now they are associated with superblocks
as well.
I have been working on a problem dealing with inodes on a 2.4 kernel, 
and was walking inode_in_use and saw inodes that were unhashed. They
all are associated with superblocks for special types. My question
is, is this expected behavior or should they be getting hashed?
Thanks
