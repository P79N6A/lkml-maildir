True for moves *to* a segment register.  There is a difference when moving
*from* a segment register.
 movl %ds,%eax  # Sets upper 16 bits of eax to an "implementation defined"
                # value according to Intel.  Actually running the insn on

It has done so for about a year. ie.
 movl %eax,%ds
 movw %ax,%ds
 mov %eax,%ds
 mov %ax,%ds
all generate the same opcode bytes.  We can't do the same for moves from a
segment register for the reason I gave above.
