It can get really ugly since the deleter has to keep
checking periodically for zero-traversal-count. During that peiod more
deletions can happen and the resulting in the need to maintain
deleters as well.
An alternative approach is to divide the timeline
of the kernel into cycles - periods where every CPU does atleast
one context switch thereby losing reference to any pointer to
kernel data. You can now batch all the deletions prior to the
start of a period and finish them after the end of that period. Any
new deletions that happens during  such a period get batched to the
next such period. Any new traversal will see not see the older
copy of the data since the global pointer(s) was updated.

Yes, various degrees of weakness of memory ordering will make writing code
harder, but it can be dealt with be defining primitives that
behaves uniformly across different architectures. As for large machines
are concerned, I hope the answer is "yes as long as it doesn't adversely
affect the lower end" :-)
