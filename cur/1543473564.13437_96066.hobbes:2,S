I know ..., but I was too busy in past to fix some strong things. :-(
My mean problem is that the latest kernel  don't work stable enough with my
equipment, the last really stable was 109 or so, long time ago.
With 132 (latest I tried) and 125,126,127,130 I got "Unknown interrupt" and the
system is unusable (2.0.36 and 2.1.109 runs without problems).
The "Unknown interrupt"  message occurs randomly, but I can't compile the
whole kernel without getting it. 
My system:
Gigabyte 586DX with 2 586 MMX 233 MHz (SMP)
Adaptec WIDE SCSI onboard
ELSA OFFICE (Permedia 2) graphic card
ISDN cards :-)
I will try 2.2 pre this evening, but if anybody has ideas about my problem,
please drop me a note.

Thats not good, but OK.
Will you accept patches, which are not perfect now and have some ugly parts
in the moment (works not on all architectures, dummy code), but make ISDN
working for most cases ?
