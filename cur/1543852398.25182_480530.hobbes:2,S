Hi Andrew,
After Andrew Victor explained to me how at91rm9200 does hardware
address initialization and phy probing, I decided to give it a go on
avr32 as well. So here's one patch for the avr32 platform code and one
for the actual macb driver which implements those changes.
I suspect that the avr32 platform patches might get messy, so feel free
to drop them all and pull from the master branch of
	git://www.atmel.no/~hskinnemoen/linux/kernel/avr32.git master
instead. I won't put any new drivers or updates to drivers that are not
in mainline there.
I will still post patches for the avr32 platform code just to show how
things are affecting the platform-specific bits.
