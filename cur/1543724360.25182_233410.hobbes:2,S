I don't know if any of the 0/NULL kernel patches were of this form,
but I've seen sparse complain about this in my code and found it
somewhat annoying.  I think the following is at least remotely debatable...
Suppose I have
	struct foo {
		int a;
		int b;
	};
then sparse is perfectly happy with someone clearing out a struct foo
like this:
	struct foo bar = { 0 };
but then if someone changes struct foo to be
	struct foo {
		void *x;
		int a;
		int b;
	};
sparse will complain about that initialization, and all of the fixes
I can think of seem somewhat worse than the original to me:
	struct foo bar = { NULL };   /* will I have to change this
                                        again if struct foo changes? */
or
	struct foo bar = { .a = 0 }; /* why do I have to name a member? */
or
	struct foo bar;
	memset(&bar, 0, sizeof bar); /* WRONG if a null pointer is not
                                        the bit pattern 0 */
