No, not quite. After about 30 minutes of uptime and a moderate load of 
eth0 (100-200KB/s constant data flow) it happened again. :(

[repeating endlessly]
I've booted a kernel without APIC and IOAPIC compiled and it works again.
I'm attaching a dmesg from a boot with IOAPIC enabled. I don't really 
know where to look for the problem here. The interrupt counter for the 
IRQ eth0 is using (a Realtek 8029 chipset) is growing significantly 
after a while. And after a while is seems to get stuck (Tx timed out). 
"ifconfig eth0 down" and "up" again did nothing. Sometimes it seems to 
fix such network problems.
