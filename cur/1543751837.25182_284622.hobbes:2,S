What do you mean by "fix them up" ? With your minimal fix the other do_brk() callers 
do not have the lock, you dont mean "fix" by grabbing the lock?

OK - the old mappings have been unmapped at this point, correct? There are no 
mappings at all?
I think you also need to fix some cases in arch/sparc{64},arch/mips? as Alan said.

I think the rule "always have mmap_sem locked when calling do_brk()" is simpler and
easier to understand, but hey, you prefer the minimal fix.
I was also not sure if it was safe to NOT have the lock except for execve() as 
you mention.
