And then a process calls USBDEVFS_SUBMITURB and immediately exits; its
pid gets reused by a completely different process (maybe even
root-owned), then the urb completes, and kill_proc_info() sends the
signal to the unsuspecting process.

Hmm, then probably send_sig_info() should check for non-NULL
p->sighand after taking tasklist_lock?  Otherwise all uses of
send_sig_info() for non-current tasks are unsafe.
"git grep -w send_sig_info" shows that most callers call
send_sig_info() for the current task, except these:
arch/sparc/kernel/traps.c:      send_sig_info(SIGFPE, &info, fpt);
arch/sparc64/kernel/sys_sunos32.c:      send_sig_info(SIGSYS, &info, current);
drivers/char/drm/drm_irq.c:                     send_sig_info( vbl_sig->info.si_signo, &vbl_sig->info, vbl_sig->task );
drivers/usb/core/devio.c:               send_sig_info(as->signr, &sinfo, as->task);
drivers/usb/core/inode.c:                       send_sig_info(ds->discsignr, &sinfo, ds->disctask);
drivers/usb/gadget/file_storage.c:                      send_sig_info(SIGUSR1, SEND_SIG_FORCED, thread_task);
kernel/signal.c:        return send_sig_info(sig, (void*)(long)(priv != 0), p);
BTW, all other callers of send_sig_info() are under
arch/{alpha,arm,sparc,sparc64}/ - 23 total.
