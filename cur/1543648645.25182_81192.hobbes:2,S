Did you see the next patch (21/26 serial #2) ? It looks even more interesting.
As I understand serial98.c driver should support older i8251 UART.
However it does it by perverting 8250.c and EMULATING i8250 on top of i8251,
see ugly code in serial_in() and serial_out() functions.
May be I misunderstand the issue, but IMHO this patch is unacceptible too :(
Best regards.
