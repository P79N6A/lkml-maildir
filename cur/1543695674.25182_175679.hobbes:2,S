Indeed, although certain things could be half-kernel, half-user
  (OK, 0.01% kernel, 99.99% user, e.g. userspace daemon that
  intercepts certain writes).  Of course, at that point, you might
  make a special library to interact with the daemon directly, although
  it's then not at all like just calling write().
Actually, thinking about it, it's ideal to have as a pluggable userspace
  daemon: on open() or a little after, determine the filetype, and forward
  interactions to a module/plugin that knows how to deal with that
  data format.  The plugin then calls some under-process (either back to
  the daemon or some other thing) to then archive off the information.

Indeed.  I prefer to keep my crashes in userspace.  :)

Amen, my brother!  ;)

"Asked by CollabNet CTO Brian Behlendorf whether Microsoft will enforce its
 patents against open source projects, Mundie replied, 'Yes, absolutely.'
 An audience member pointed out that many open source projects aren't
 funded and so can't afford legal representation to rival Microsoft's. 'Oh
 well,' said Mundie. 'Get your money, and let's go to court.' 
Microsoft's patents only defensive?
