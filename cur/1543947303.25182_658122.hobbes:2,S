The big problem with that is
 - the people who know about the devices are usually not kernel people
 - the workarounds that the whitelist requires is quite often not a kernel 
   workaround.
In other words, the most common workarounds for the s2ram whitelist is 
usually to do things like running vbetool in user-level to do VGA register 
save/restore (VBE_POST and VGE_SAVE). Sure, the kernel could do that with 
usermodehelper etc, but s2ram also has those things as command line flags 
etc, so...
