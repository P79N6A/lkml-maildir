cifs doesn't support w98 and w95 properly yet.  Steve's working on
it, and we hope to have that in place for 2.6.18.
So at this stage, 2.6.18 still appears to be a good time to start pushing
people toward cifs, and December looks like an appropriate time to mark
smbfs as broken.  Subject to, of course, feedback-from-the-field.
