How does this map up with Viro's idea of a two stage mount.  IIRC, it
was someting akin to:
fsfd = open(/dev/fs_type/ext2)
write(fd, "device and options, potentially including auth...");
mntfd = open("mntpt");
newmount(fd, mntfd, MNT_ATTACH);
or something like that.  Wouldn't that give you a free form abiility to
talk to the fs driver and authenticate as needed?  Is this plan still
alive?
thanks,
