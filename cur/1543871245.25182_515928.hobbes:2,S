Can I please second this (having been burned by hell that was udev of
the 0.5ish era) - Greg, please try to make changes in a cross-compatible
way so that versions of userspace and kernel are not so closely
dependant on tracking each other.  The whole 2.6.8 -> 2.6.12 series of
kernels and associated udevs are fraught with race conditions where
upgrading one but not the other will leave your machine unbootable.
I read the "manifesto" for udev showing how crap devfs was, it was
broken, it could never be fixed etc - yet my experience was that devfs
systems "just worked"[tm] and udev was very dangerous.  My thinking is
going to be tarnished by that for a while and my mental image of udev
is "unreliable POS".  I'm hoping enough good experiences with udev might
make me feel less scared whenever I have to deal with it.
Similarly, I'm hoping I don't have to think "oh shit, will this break
boot" every time I upgrade either a kernel or hal version for the next
year, because it would really suck to do that all over again.  It
contributes to the meme that linux is unreliable and perpetually
unstable.
Regards,
Bron.
