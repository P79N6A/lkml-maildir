No it isn't.

Then you can't use __local_xxx, and so many architectures will use
atomic instructions (the ones who don't are the ones with tripled
cacheline footprint of this structure).
Sure i386 and x86-64 are happy, but this would probably slow down
most other architectures.

Probably right.

Yep, it will be difficult to test.
