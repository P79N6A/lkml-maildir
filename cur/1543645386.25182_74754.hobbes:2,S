simply replying to one of you all ...
Most important problem I currently see is that one of two kernels
do not boot on my MP machine I use as a workstation.
Apart from that and after early 2.5.3x probs were sorted out
I already had 2.5-bk-kernels running and did the following on that
MP machine:
- compiled linux-2.5-bks
- compiled X (runs with multi head)
- listend to music (emu10k)
- watched TV (bttv)
- burned CDs (SCSI)
- ran amanda: dumped multiple input streams from network to IDE disks
  before writing to SCSI tape
- ran vmware (after patchwork to compile ;-)
- started looking at sym53c416 cli() removal and had the scanner
  doing his work (started to debug some pnp things there too, results
  to be posted)
- changed to devfs
- printing and serial are fine too
- the new input stuff now behaves properly too
often did multiple things in parallel (watching tv while compiling
a new kernel, ...)
had really few crashes (~4-6 since 2.5.34)
had some compilation probs with modules and MP but they got either
fixed too fast or patches went into bk within 1-2 days :-)
Going to check JFS (and XFS) in the near future...
So I think I am either one almost happy person with a lotta luck or
you all (did) do a very excellent job!!! ... but please get those
MP (boot) probs sorted out ;-)
Before you start asking what probs: this time it's around ACPI init.

so it must be around ... and I assume it's mp_config_ioapic_for_sci()
but still have to trace ...

        if (ACPI_FAILURE(status)) {
                printk(KERN_ERR PREFIX "Unable to get the FADT\n");
                goto error1;
        }

        if (acpi_ioapic)

        if (ACPI_FAILURE(status)) {
                printk(KERN_ERR PREFIX "Unable to start the ACPI Interpreter\n");
                goto error1;
