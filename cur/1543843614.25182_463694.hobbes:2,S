That only Karim's experience is being in question here?

Well, I'm first to admit that LTT needs improvement, but that has never 
been the point.
We need to get to some kind of agreement what level of tracing Linux 
should support in general, preferably something that is easy to 
integrate and usable by everyone. Especially the latter means that there 
is not one true solution, so we need to figure out what kind of common
infrastructure can be implemented, from which all of them can benefit.
At this point you've been rather uncompromising contrary to every single 
argument from either side.
bye, Roman
