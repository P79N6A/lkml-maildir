  rsize/wsize only have minimal effect. The negotiated  size seems to be optimal.

 For experiments, sure. But I do not think that I want to have 8 GB of dirty pages [potentially] laying around. Are you sure that 1% is a useful value for dirty_ratio? Looking at the code, it seems a minimum of 5% is  enforced  in "page-writeback.c:get_dirty_limits":
        dirty_ratio = vm_dirty_ratio;
        if (dirty_ratio > unmapped_ratio / 2)
                dirty_ratio = unmapped_ratio / 2;
        if (dirty_ratio < 5)
                dirty_ratio = 5;

 Sure, the fact that a UFS (or SAM-FS) based FS behaves well in the same situation points in that direction.

 I will try to get an iostat trace from the Sun side. Thanks for the suggestion.
