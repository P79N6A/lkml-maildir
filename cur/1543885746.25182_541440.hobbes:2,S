But this is the most common case, that was my point.
Look, we can add
	if (!get_wq_data(work))
		/* it was never queued */
		return;
at the very start of cancel_xxx() functions. This will optimize out
del_timer + try_to_grab_pending() _sometimes_. Should we do this?
I don't think so. I think it is better to save a couple of bytes
from i-cache, but not to try to optimize the unlikely case.

No, no, the loop won't be endless. Why do you think so? We spin until the timer
is started, or until the work is queued.
