OK; I can accept that provided there is a way to change the "what to
do with an I/O request" policy from auto-resume to something else
while we're suspending the system (and presumably restore the old
policy on system resume if the device was runtime-suspended at the
point where the system was suspended).

No; the late suspend call isn't appropriate for all drivers.  It is a
simple and safe way to do the suspend for some drivers, mostly the
simpler ones.  Things that are complex enough to have a subsystem
(e.g. USB) would want to use the early suspend call.

Then late-suspend is not appropriate for that driver, and it needs to
use the early-suspend call, and do something such as setting a flag
that the I/O request function tests.
