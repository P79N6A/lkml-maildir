	No, and you shouldn't want to know. Even if the other end ACKed the data,
that doesn't mean that the application on the other end didn't crash. So it
won't tell you what you want to know, which is 'did the application on the
other end process the data?'.
	Application-level guarantees can only be provided by application-level
code.
