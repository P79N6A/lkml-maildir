s/fixed compilation/appeared to work around a compiler bug/

It breaks elsewhere in various ways (or has broken; maybe they update
things they still call 2.96).

(1) I don't trust it for runtime code either; there have been problems.
(2) These idiotic rearrangements of code to work around compiler bugs
	are worthless since you'll eventually end up eventually needing
	contradictory changes to work around different compilers' bugs.
	They're also total crap changes, worthless code churn, and even
	uglify the code.
(3) 2.96? You must be kidding. Current is bordering on 3.4 if it's not
	there already. Do you think anyone's still taking patches for
	2.2.8 Linux kernels? Now apply the same reasoning to gcc. Some
	backport TLC from a distro is not going to be able to bring it
	up to modern standards.
(4) 2 versions of gcc is nothing and has zero bearing on the C++ ABI
	braindamage that went around a couple of years ago as it's not
	a C++ compiler.
