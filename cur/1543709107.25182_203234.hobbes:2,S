???  I checked the x86-64 early page tables and it does appear to work.
That is why I consolidated the change.  
In particular from arch/x86_64/head.S:
.org 0x1000
ENTRY(init_level4_pgt)
	.quad	0x0000000000102007		/* -> level3_ident_pgt */
	.fill	255,8,0
	.quad	0x000000000010a007
	.fill	254,8,0
	/* (2^48-(2*1024*1024*1024))/(2^39) = 511 */
	.quad	0x0000000000103007		/* -> level3_kernel_pgt */
.org 0x3000
ENTRY(level3_kernel_pgt)
	.fill	510,8,0
	/* (2^48-(2*1024*1024*1024)-((2^39)*511))/(2^30) = 510 */
	.quad	0x0000000000105007		/* -> level2_kernel_pgt */
	.fill	1,8,0
.org 0xa000
ENTRY(level3_physmem_pgt)
	.quad	0x0000000000105007		/* -> level2_kernel_pgt (so that __va works even before pagetable_init) */
0x0000010000000000 is handled by the pointer: 0x000000000010a007
0xffffffff80000000 is handled by the pointer: 0x0000000000103007
And then they both point to: 0x0000000000103007 which is the physical mapping.
And of course there is the comment on the 0xa000 entry:
(so that __va works even before pagetable_init)
So I don't see how using __va() early in the code is incorrect.  I can
buy that __va() adds the wrong constant but that is another matter.
