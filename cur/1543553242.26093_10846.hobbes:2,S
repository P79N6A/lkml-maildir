Right. This means you have to ensure (somehow blocking the process(es) with
access to the buffer(s) involved) that nobody can see half-filled buffers.
Tricky, but not impossible, at least not in principle. Or play VM games and
switch the areas underneath atomically. The VM games we have been told are
costlier than the average copy on "typical" machines (PCs, presumably ;-),
plus you'd have to either ensure aligned buffers (how?) or keep two copies
of whatever surrounds them (where is the advantage then?).
