Well this message pops up whenever the frequency changes, because
the CPU does not have constant_tsc. E.g.
<performance is default and active>
echo 598000 >/sys/devices/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq
spews out the clocksource message. I do not think the clocksource
is a culprit. The kernel just noticed the TSC jumped and hence
uses a new clocksource.

Nevermind, it does not look like it gets any cooler at lower frequencies,
so it's a nobrainer to run it at the default 733.
