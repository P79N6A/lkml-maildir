   What would one be looking for?  I don't know what the sideeffects of
   update_mmu_cache() might be.
   
   It looks to be the same as do_no_page() though: the update_mmu_cache() is
   the last substantive thing which happens in the fault or the syscall.
   
Yes, this is what I was talking about, making sure do_file_page()'s
return path isn't doing a update_mmu_cache() call already.
I don't believe this is an error (to do it twice for the same fault)
but it would be superfluous.
