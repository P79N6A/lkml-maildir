mm7 crashed where mm2 works.
The machine is a dual celeron with two scsi disks with
some raid-1 & raid-0 partitions.
deadline or anicipatory scheduler does not make a difference.
It dies anyway, attempting to kill init.
Here's what I managed to  write down before the 30 second reboot
kicked in:
EIP is at md_wakeup_thread
stack:
do_md_run
autorun_array
autorun_devices
autostart_arrays
md_ioctl
dentry_open
kmem_cache_free
blkdev_ioctl
sys_ioctl
init
init
This happened during the boot process. The kernel is compiled
with gcc 2.95.4 from debian testing. The machine uses devfs
