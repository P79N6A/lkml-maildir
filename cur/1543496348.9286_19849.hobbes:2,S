Variations on this theme: a bitmap counter map.  Each entry in the
counter map is an integer, one for each bitmap block.  The number of
bits set in a bitmap block is stored in the counter map.
When the counter map value hits zero, the bitmap block itself is ignored
-- you can simply bforget() it saving a write.
Also this could perhaps optimise bitmap searches for free space?
I'm not sure if that would gain anything.
Enjoy,
