Hard to say, really.  Yes, I think the frequency of reports has increased a
bit in the last month or two.  But it's always been a really small number
of people so that may not be statistically significant.
umm,
there was one report in January		(seems to be a kernel memory leak)
One in February				(ditto)
One in June
Two in July (one was with no swap, one with laptop_mode)
A few in August, but mainly due to the CDROM memory leak.
On August 23 the thrashing control was added.
After that, two or three people have been reporting it.
So yes, we do seem to have gone from basically zero reports up to a trickle.
