Hi all,
I'm the author of the document "Introduction to Linux Kernel
Development Process" hosted at
http://linux.tar.bz/articles/2.6-development_process.
Part of the document has been included in Documentation/HOWTO
I was reading  both the documents while I started, again, to think
about how to improve the quality of the vanilla kernels.
Here are a few line of the document I wrote:
---8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<---
 --- 2.6.x kernels ---
2.6.x kernels are maintained by Linus Torvalds,
it's development is as follow:
- As soon a new kernel is released a two weeks windows is open, during
  this period of time maintainers can submit big diffs to Linus, usually
  the patched sited in -mm kernels for a few weeks.
  Preferred way to submit big changes is using GIT
  (more information about GIT at 
http://git.or.cz/
 and
  
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/tutorial.html
).
- After two weeks a -rc1 kernel is released and now is possible to
  push only patches that do not include new functionalities that could
  affect the stability of the whole kernel. Please note that a whole
  new driver (or filesystem) might be accepted
  after -rc1 because there is no risk of causing regressions with
  such a change
- A new -rc is released whenever Linus deems the current git
 (the kernel's source management) tree to be in a reasonably sane state
  adequate for testing. The goal is to release a new -rc kernel every week.
- Process continues until the kernel is considered "ready", the
  process should last around 6 weeks ( 6 kernels per year should be
  released) an usually includes 4/5 rc releases.
---8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<------8<---
The sentence "Process continues until the kernel is considered "ready"
" should probably be changed in order to reflect the usage of the
"regression list" that Adrian and then Michal were used to maintain.
Is there a "stable" place were users can read/comment/modify the list?
Wasn't Google interested in employee a person to take care of
regression/bug report? (Yes, if there is an open position I would be
interested in applying ;-).
Thanks!
Regards,
