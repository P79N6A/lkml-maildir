OK.

OK, but remember that my problem is to find a way to access the machine
when I only have a serial console and it doesn't complete the "classical"
boot process because some init script at runlevel 3 is blocking...
This means that I can't go up to the "configure /sbin/sulogin", and need
a way to be given a serial prompt only by giving parameter at the LILO
prompt, considering that the kernel has already been configured for serial
console.
> /dev/ttySx for multi user modes (see the serial console howto)
This is already done.

Paul
