You can, if you can keep the internal state sufficiently small.
Say we want to keep the internal state down to 32 bit,
using a 16GB lookup table. (4G*32bit)
What would the state be?  Perhaps one general-purpose
8-bit register, a 16-bit program counter and
8 bits left for the current opcode & flags.
Less opportunities than a 6502, but it'd sure be fast.
