md does not rely on device names, it can work on array UUID's too (check 
out man mdadm.conf).

To avoid these kinds of pitfalls I usually only specify UUID's for mdadm 
to assemble, not device-names. Mount can also work with partition UUID's 
  if you are not using something like devicemapper or md in between that 
has a static device name scheme.
Beware that you may need a fairly modern initramfs/initrd setup to get 
all this to work cleanly, especially if the root device is involved.
