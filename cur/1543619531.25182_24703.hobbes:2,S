Unfortunately during conversion I found that there is lib/bust_spinlocks.c,
which is always included in lib.a, is always compiled, even if architecture
provides its own bust_spinlocks function.
As no other module in lib/ uses module_init() initalization, it looks
to me like that we should move crc32.c from lib/ to kernel/, instead of
turning lib.a into lib.o.
But of course if there is consensus that I should convert lib/lib.a
into lib/lib.o, I can either create Config.in symbol 
CONFIG_NEED_GENERIC_BUST_SPINLOCK, or add HAVE_ARCH_BUST_SPINLOCK #define
into some of i386, ia64, mips64, s390 and s390x architecture dependent
headers.
