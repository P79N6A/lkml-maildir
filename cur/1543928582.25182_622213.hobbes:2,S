Well, I suppose, but there's nothing particularly "internal" about the
functions that these modules want to get access to.  They are the proper
API functions for doing what the modules want to do.
And we have enough weird little config-dependent corners of the kernel
API that complicate testing; I don't think we need to knowingly
introduce more.

Anything that once worked but now does not is a regression.  Generally
when we intend a regression like this, we call it a deprecation of an
interface and have a procedure for that.  It was not my intention to
cause a regression with this change, and an unintended regression is a bug.

Why is it a step back?  What are the steps ahead?  There's been no
discussion on this point, so I don't think you can assume there's a
clear way forward.
I think Linus and Andrew have been pretty clear on the policy for these
kinds of things: regressions are always bad, even if fixing the
regression means some other bugfix needs to be put off.
