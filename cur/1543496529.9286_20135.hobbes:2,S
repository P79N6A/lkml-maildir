one's complement arithmetic (see rfc1071 for details on the checksum)

ppro+ breaks up instructions into something intel calls 'microops'.
There are three decoders, the first can do four microops per cycle,
the other two only one/cycle. so you can have up to three instructions
per cycle, but only one can be complex and the others must be simple.
For example that routine with "%adcl XX(%esi), %eax" replaced with
"addl  XX(%esi), %eax ; setc %ch; addb %ch, %bl" only does two
percent worse. With "addl  XX(%esi), %eax ; adcl $0, %ebx" it does
10% worse.
