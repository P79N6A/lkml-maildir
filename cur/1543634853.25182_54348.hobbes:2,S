I tried commenting out various pci_writes/pci_reads, but I'm not
familiar enough with the code to say whether what I did was
meaningful or not.
In any case, it still didn't let me boot the machine with the 160GB
disk installed.
I've now bought a Highpoint Rocket133SB card and plugged the 160GB
disk into that instead, and everything works fine.  I get DMA to my
main disk via the ALI15X3 controller, and DMA to the 160GB disk via
the Rocket card.
