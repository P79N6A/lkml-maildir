Neither did I, but introducing printk's through the function, we narrowed
the problem to this part of the code. And removing it makes the problem
go away. We inserted 37 printk's in the function body, and Jose bisected
those until the problem went away.

OK, thanks for clarifying.

Hmm, ok. And what about a CONFIG_I_KNOW_MY_SERIAL_IS_BROKEN option?

Sorry, I suck, I got that mixed with that one:

"probing for UART_BUG_TXEN in 8250 driver leads to weird effects on some
ARM boards"
