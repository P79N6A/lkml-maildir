Booting git snapshot of about 6 hours ago, getting the following:
USB Universal Host Controller Interface driver v3.0
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [ALKB] enabled at IRQ 21
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:10.0[A] -> Link [ALKB] -> GSI 21 (level, low) -> IRQ 18
ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:00:10.0 disabled
uhci_hcd 0000:00:10.0: init 0000:00:10.0 fail, -16
uhci_hcd: probe of 0000:00:10.0 failed with error -16
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:10.1[A] -> Link [ALKB] -> GSI 21 (level, low) -> IRQ 18
ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:00:10.1 disabled
uhci_hcd 0000:00:10.1: init 0000:00:10.1 fail, -16
uhci_hcd: probe of 0000:00:10.1 failed with error -16
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:10.2[B] -> Link [ALKB] -> GSI 21 (level, low) -> IRQ 18
ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:00:10.2 disabled
uhci_hcd 0000:00:10.2: init 0000:00:10.2 fail, -16
uhci_hcd: probe of 0000:00:10.2 failed with error -16
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:10.3[B] -> Link [ALKB] -> GSI 21 (level, low) -> IRQ 18
ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:00:10.3 disabled
uhci_hcd 0000:00:10.3: init 0000:00:10.3 fail, -16
uhci_hcd: probe of 0000:00:10.3 failed with error -16
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:10.4[C] -> Link [ALKB] -> GSI 21 (level, low) -> IRQ 18
ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:00:10.4 disabled
ehci_hcd 0000:00:10.4: init 0000:00:10.4 fail, -16
ehci_hcd: probe of 0000:00:10.4 failed with error -16
With "pci=routeirq" it is the same, but then it's "IRQ 17" instead of 18, 
and the line
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [ALKB] enabled at IRQ 21
is missing. Works with Debian etch default 2.6.18. /proc/interrupts under 
.23-rc9-...:
$ cat /proc/interrupts
           CPU0
  0:      31756   IO-APIC-edge      timer
  1:          2   IO-APIC-edge      i8042
  8:          1   IO-APIC-edge      rtc
  9:          0   IO-APIC-fasteoi   acpi
 12:          4   IO-APIC-edge      i8042
 16:       2627   IO-APIC-fasteoi   sata_via
 19:        472   IO-APIC-fasteoi   eth0
Under 2.6.18:
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [ALKB] enabled at IRQ 21
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:10.0[A] -> Link [ALKB] -> GSI 21 (level, low) -> IRQ 177
PCI: VIA IRQ fixup for 0000:00:10.0, from 10 to 1
uhci_hcd 0000:00:10.0: UHCI Host Controller
uhci_hcd 0000:00:10.0: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 1
uhci_hcd 0000:00:10.0: irq 177, io base 0x0000f900
Thanks
