Moreover I get some weird networking problems which prevent setting up the
routes (RNETLINK invalid argument messages) when I compile my kernel with
4.0.1 while the same kernel, same config works fine compiled with 3.2.3...
So eventhough 4.0 is supposed to be supported, it doesn't work too well in
my case.
