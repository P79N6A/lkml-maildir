It is in my git tree up on kernel.org.  I think it is in my proof-of-concept
branch.
The individual commits tell a tangled tale that is definitely unacceptable
for an upstream merge but the actual result is interesting.
If that isn't enough to find it, tell me and I will track down the details.
It has been a couple months since I posted it during the design discussion
and I'm way overdue for being in bed, tonight.
