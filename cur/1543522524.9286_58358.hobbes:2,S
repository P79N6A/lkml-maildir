Hi,
I've had excactly the same oops occurring twice today (so far), and I
can't figure out why. The machine configuration is:
 o 2x intel pentiumII 450MHz CPUs
 o 512MB RAM
 o Adaptec AIC-7890/1 Ultra2 SCSI host adapter
 o 3x IBM DRVS09V 8.8GB
 o 2x Seagate ST15150W 4.1GB
 o 3Com 3c905B Cyclone 100baseTx
The kernel is stock 2.2.14 plus the latest NFSv2 stable patches from
CVS, but I don't think the oops is NFS related.
Any help will be much appreciated, as this server is running a few
quite important tasks.
I have included the output from ksymoops and the kernel configuration
file. If more information is needed, please let me know.
Thanks,
-trond
Output from ksymoops:
---------------------
WARNING: This version of ksymoops is obsolete.
WARNING: The current version can be obtained from 
ftp://ftp.ocs.com.au/pub/ksymoops
Options used: -V (default)
              -o /lib/modules/2.2.14/ (default)
              -k /proc/ksyms (default)
              -l /proc/modules (default)
              -m /usr/src/linux/System.map (default)
              -c 1 (default)
You did not tell me where to find symbol information.  I will assume
that the log matches the kernel and modules that are running right now
and I'll use the default options above for symbol resolution.
If the current kernel and/or modules do not match the log, you can get
more accurate output by telling me the kernel version and where to find
map, modules, ksyms etc.  ksymoops -h explains the options.
No modules in ksyms, skipping objects
Warning, no symbols in lsmod, is /proc/modules a valid lsmod file?
