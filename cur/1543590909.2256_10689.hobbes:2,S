What version of serial.c? I'm assuming 5.05.
Define "go kablooey". We haven't noticed any problems, and we supplied
this bit of code.
The size_fifo() routine supplies its own baud rate divisor, and
on any rs_open() change_speed() sets the baud rate properly.
I can't figure what you might be seeing.

You're correct that the detection works as is, except that you
broke it in your patch. See below.

This isn't necessary. The revision field is only checked
for 950s, so setting it here doesn't harm anything. If the
current (only) example of checking it is followed as normal
procedure, the port type will always be checked first, before
checking the revision, ensuring only valid revisions are
referenced.

Only saving the revision for 850s is probably wrong. It should
be saved for all the 85x uarts.
