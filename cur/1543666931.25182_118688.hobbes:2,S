I wrote a PixelView (Cirrus Logic GD-5465) tuner&grabber device driver. 
(V4L interface)
 I'm not sure to which kernel should I patch against (I developed using 
vanilla 2.4.20).
Should I try diff's against current 2.4.x , or try to make it to the 
2.5.current and drop
support for 2.4.x ? or maybe both.
Respect,
Alex Damian
