I am sincerely sorry for being a bother, but I have spent several
hours searching far and wide for information on it, both in the
archives and generally on the web, without any luck in finding
anything. If it's not too much to ask, would you be as kind as to
provide a pointer?
Btw., Is there any preferred method of announcing hotplug events to
user interfaces?
