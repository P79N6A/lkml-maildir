Mr King, I'm not an idiot!
Can you _please_ explain what makes ARM so special here?
Why can't we have an array of this structure on ARM?
struct ssb_device_id {
       __u16   vendor;
       __u16   coreid;
       __u8    revision;
};
I will not apply any patches that I don't understand.
Why doesn't the compiler handle this? What's special? Can you please explain?
