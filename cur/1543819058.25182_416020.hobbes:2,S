Subject: [GIT PATCH] Driver Core and sysfs patches for 2.6.17-rc1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Here are some driver core and sysfs patches for 2.6.17-rc1.  They contain
the following changes:
	- allow sysfs files to be polled (this missed the initial
	  2.6.16-git merge due to the patch being reworked by Neil.  It
	  has been included in the -mm tree for a number of months now
	  with no reported issues.  Sorry for missing this one the first
	  time around this cycle)
	- fix bug in manual binding of devices to drivers.
	- report the offending driver when suspend fails
	- fix partition scanning and reporting to userspace (was being
	  reported before the scanning was finished, which isn't very
	  nice.)
	- few other minor bugfixes and build fixes.
All of these patches have been in the -mm tree for a number of weeks, if
not months (in the case of the sysfs poll patch).
Please pull from:
	rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-2.6.git/
or if master.kernel.org hasn't synced up yet:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-2.6.git/
Patches will be sent as a follow-on to this message to lkml for people
to see.
thanks,
greg k-h
