Well, it's obviously not a good time for this. First, suspend and
shutdown don't necessarily do the same thing, then it just doesn't work
in practice. So either do it right completely or not at all, but 2.6.13
isn't the place for an half-assed hack that looks like a solution to
you.
I do agree that there are enough similarities between the suspend and
shutdown process that we could use the same callback, but then, please,
at least with a different argument and with drivers beeing fixed to
handle it. Most drivers should probably just "ignore" shutdown anyway.
BTW. I suppose we still have the same constant for PMSG_FREEZE and
PMSG_SUSPEND ? That could have been fixed ages ago and is more important
imho....
Ben.
