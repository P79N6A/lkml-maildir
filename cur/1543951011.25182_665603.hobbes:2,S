My vote would be to include this sort of thing with a run-time option to 
enable the extra spew, since its a perfectly accepted standard for other 
drivers. It ought to be extremely useful in determining whats going wrong 
with end-user setups, particularly in cases where we can't reproduce the 
problem (typically for lack of having the specific hardware in-house).
