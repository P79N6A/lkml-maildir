The difference between 2.4 and 2.6 is not CB_CBCARD (0x0020), but
CB_PWRCYCLE (0x0008).
For some reason 2.6.x hasn't powered up the 16-bit card.
However, the whole CB_POWERCYCLE thing is ignored for 16-bit cards,
and what you end up doing by marking the card as a 32-bit cardbus card
(that's what the CB_CBCARD define means) is to basically force the
wrong code to be run, at which point the 32-bit code decides that
the card isn't powered.
The real question is why the card isn't powered up. Also, it sounds
like the 16-bit status (from I365_STATUS) doesn't agree with the 32-bit
status (from CB_SOCKET_STATE), so when you _do_ force trusting of the
32-bit status, then things work.
Which is interesting in itself. It's entirely possible that we should
just ignore the 16-bit status when it comes to the SS_POWERON logic.
Does the card actually _work_ when you do your hack? Or does it just
stop the hang?
