Andrew seems to be comming from the point of view of a developer rather than a 
developer/ maintainer.
So, the counter argument is the user who is sending the thing into the field and 
wants to send just one binary kernel to all locations.  But then he needs to 
debug some problem that will work fine over the lan and later one that requires 
an early connection which the lan can not, as yet, do.  I agree that for you or 
me, this is not an issue, but what of the IT folks...
As to KGDB_MORE and KGDB_OPTIONS, they were put in for those who want to change 
the "O" option.  I feel it should NOT be changed, but I recognize that some 
folks want to reduce the optimizer distortions.  I opted for a generalized 
capability to cover all bases...
KGDB_TS is for code developers.  I invented it to give a poor mans LTT and it 
has served me well.  I am not sure we need to be able to turn it off, however.
The stack overflow thing is, I think, now in the kernel AND I have never had a 
machine behave so badly that it actually caught one.  It can go.
