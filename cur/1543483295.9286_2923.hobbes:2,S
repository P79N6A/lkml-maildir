As an update to my own message..
This card comes with a 2k dos com file which sets the dma/int/irq for sb16
compatibility. I dont think it's a TSR. 
I dont have a copy of dos around here and I can't mount my freedos image
to put the file there (dont have msdos kernel module.. :) )... I'm
reasonable sure I can just disassemble this executable and find the ports
it plays with.. :)
It should then work (though without the fancy features).
