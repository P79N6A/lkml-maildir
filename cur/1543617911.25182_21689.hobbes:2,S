That is what I would expect up to a point. "Free" memory is wasted memory so
it is better to let all the free memory fill up with any bits of disk data
we have seen and might want again.
What actually matters (and sounds like 2.4.13 didnt do) is that at the point
you need memory for other things like applications and disk buffers that are
relevant to current usage the old stuff should rapidly get replaced by it.
