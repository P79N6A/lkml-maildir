The fact it appears to work on an unpowered hub doesn't mean anything. 
Why would the manufacturer specify it can consume 178 mA if it couldn't 
consume that much under some conditions? Have you measured it? What 
makes you think that the hub can supply that much power on all ports at 
the same time despite not being specified to do so?
Trying to say "Well, it says it needs this much, but it probably doesn't 
really NEED that much.." is an unreliable guessing game.

If the device can't get enough power, all kinds of bad stuff can happen. 
  This is the reason why USB power budgeting is part of the standard in 
the first place. The kernel has no business ignoring such restrictions, 
not without a clearly-marked-as-dangerous user choice.

Keep in mind that Windows will not permit the USB device to work in such 
configurations either. Windows always did the right thing here. Linux 
did not do the right thing before, and now it does.
