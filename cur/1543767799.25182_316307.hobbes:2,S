The problem is that pfn_to_nid is defined by the memory model.  In the
SPARSEMEM case it isn't always usable until after the we have
initialised and allocated the sparse mem_maps.  It is allocations during
this phase that need this early_pfn_to_nid() form, to guide its
allocations of the mem_map to obtain locality with the physical memory
blocks.
This is clearer in the i386 port where the early_pfn_to_nid()
implementation uses low level table to determine the location.  As has
been mentioned in another thread, we are using what is effectivly a
DISCONTIGMEM data structure here.  I have some work in progress to split
that last part and move to a true early implementation on ppc64 too.
