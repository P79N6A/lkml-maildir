Subject: [PATCH 2.6.22] [0/5] x86 updates for 2.6.22-stable
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/15/76

Should all go into the next stable release.
Two of the patches (cfi probe and rept fix) are only pending
for mainline (I hope Linus applies them today). They should
not go in before hitting mainline.
