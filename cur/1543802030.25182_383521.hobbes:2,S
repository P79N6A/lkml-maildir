Ah, then it's likely that this isn't a real problem and it would be
expected to cause an xrun?
Anyway, it seems strange that the trace doesn't show anything. I
suppose that's because cdrecord just grabs a lot of time at a higher
priority than Jack and Jack ends up not getting serivces at all for
5-10mS?
OK, back to the drawing board about debugging my problems!
thanks!
