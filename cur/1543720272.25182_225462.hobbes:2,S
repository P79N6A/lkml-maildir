Wine depends upon being able to execute code on the heap, and there are 
probably Windows EXEs that depend upon being able to execute code on the 
stack.
Fedore Code 1's exec-shield patch broke Wine badly, as there was no way 
for an application to turn it off from user space, and Wine depended 
upon certain areas of virtual memory being free.
We developed a hack to work around this problem by creating a staticly 
linked binary to reserve memory then load ld-linux.so.2 and a 
dynamically executable into memory manually and run start them.
So, just to confirm, an executable will be able to be built so that it 
can request an executable stack and heap using PT_GNU_STACK or something 
like that, right?
thanks,
Mike
