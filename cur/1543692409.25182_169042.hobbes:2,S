Hi All,
I met a very funny problem. I am writing the ethernet-over-usb driver for 
our PDA based on embedded Linux and QT/Qtopia. We use Qtopia desktop as the 
sync tools. Before our device launched the Qtopia-1.6.2. I can ping the 
device from my computer for a very long time. It looks that the connection 
is very stable. When Qtopia was launched, the connection will vanished in a 
short while, >3 seconds. How long the connection can last is not a constant 
value.  When I used Qtopia desktop to do the synchronization, it will 
failed 95%.
Who knows the problem, please give me some comments. BTW, the kernel 
version is 2.4.18. QT's version is 2.3.6. Qtopia's version is 1.6.2.
Regards
Hong Feng
