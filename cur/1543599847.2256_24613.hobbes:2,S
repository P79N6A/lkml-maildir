Even worse: most microprosessors don't do comparisons that way.
They compare either two signed or two unsigned 
items and do that reasonably fast.  This is why C also works this way.
A compiler can be made to use the above standard, but it would generate
slow code for all signed/unsigned compares because now there is
3 tests instead of one.  This is why language designers don't do that.
You can of course do this explicitly in code if you need that
sort of comparison, e.g.
signed a;
unsigned b;
if (a<0) case1() 
   else if (b>MAX_SIGNED) case2()
   else if (a<b) case1() else case2();
A nice feature of C is that ugly time-consuming stuff tends to
look ugly and time-consuming in code too.  So it is easier
to avoid. :-)
