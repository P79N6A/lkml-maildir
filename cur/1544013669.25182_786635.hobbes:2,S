True enough, although the newer SSD's will have this problem addressed
(although at least initially, they are **far** more costly than the
el-cheapo 32GB SD cards you can find at the checkout counter at Fry's
alongside battery-powered shavers and trashy ipod speakers).
I will stress again, that most of this doesn't belong in
Documentation/filesystems/ext3.txt, as most of this is *not*
ext3-specific.
