Hi
A little question:
I have a little server with kernel 2.4.16 running (without any problems, very stable).
I noticed that when approximately 4 GB data are received (over Ethernet) then the counter in /proc/net/dev again begins to count from zero. 
Is it normal? Does it depend on the Ethernet-Card? 
It's a Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8029(AS)
Should I update the kernel?
greets
Marc
