Hi,
IMVHO, you should merge Scott Lurndal's built-in kdb since, to the best of
my knowledge, the intention is to maintain IKD separately. There is no
doubt that both IKD and Scott's kdb are extremely useful and
technically brilliant pieces of software but they are
also rather intrusive, i.e. one can seriously argue against having them
on a production machine. As for David Grothe's
remote gdb support it is not more intrusive than the equivalent support on
other architectures which is already included in the official kernel so I
think it should be included in the official kernel, which was already
suggested by David to Linus.
Regards,
