I have found a problem on one of my drives. On my FC4 system, hald and
kded are constantly doing something with the drive, and this makes it
fail when I try to do packet writing. Killing those processes make
that drive work correctly. Maybe this helps in your case too. Try
packet writing from single user mode to see if it helps.
I don't know yet how to make hald and kded stay away from the drive
while packet writing is in progress.
