Yes, that is normal.
Linux usually knows in advance what type of filesystem is on a device:
it looks it up in /etc/fstab.  However, that is obviously not an
option for a root filesystem, so when mounting root, the kernel just
tries all the filesystem types it knows of in order.
If you have ext3 compiled in, then the kernel tries to mount the root
as ext3 first of all.  If root is only running as ext2, then ext3
won't find a journal on the filesystem so the mount will fail.  That
is perfectly all right --- the kernel will just try the next
filesystem type in its list, and will mount it as ext2 instead.
