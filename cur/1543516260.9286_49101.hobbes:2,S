Hi,
I dd'd a BFS image to a ramdisk and mounted it - got all zeroes in file
data, then od -tx4 -Ax /dev/ram0 | less and behold all data is there
correctly (chose BFS because its layout is so trivial that you can read it
by looking at its hexdump). Then dd'd the image back to a file and mounted
via loopback - all file's now can be read correctly.
So, only when we go through VFS to /dev/ram0 (any fs on it
(any=ext2,minix,bfs)) we get zeroes as file's data. But read/write to
/dev/ram0 block device works correctly.
Regards,
Tigran.
