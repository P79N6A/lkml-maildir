	Is this a Red Hat system?  I encountered the same thing on a
RHAS system.  Basically, Anaconda had controlled the module load order
in /etc/modules.conf for 2.4.  Because my network drivers were built in
in 2.5, they loaded in the order of the compile-in.  This turned out to
be the reverse order.
	Swapping eth0 and eth1 in /etc/modules.conf fixed the problem
for me.  This is not to say it is "Red Hat's fault" or that this is
entirely the same situation, but I figured this would make a good
datapoint.
