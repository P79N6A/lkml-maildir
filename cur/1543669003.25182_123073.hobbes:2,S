The amount of work to be done is still fairly small ... and we already
do (as far as I can see) *exactly* this already for the existing
rb tree. Yes, mmap has a little bit more overhead, but you lose all
the per-page stuff, which seems much more efficient to me.

Well, yes. Except I hope nobody would want to do that on a per-page
basis. If you want that level of granularity, we should just do this 
for linear objects, and fall back to pte_chains for nonlinear.
Life would be a whole lot simpler if people were willing to specify
non-linear VMAs at create time - I don't see that as a big burden,
personally. That'd get rid of all the conversion stuff.
