I think it does perform acceptable behaviour however - if the drivers
(in the unlikely event) refuse the event after we've told user space,
we tell user space we resumed.

What if the condition of the suspend gets changed by the act of paging
in memory, or some other change that occured in user space?  It's a
chicken and egg problem. 8(

It is a minor point, but an unwanted one that just obfuscates the operation
of the APM system - only the first PM SUSPEND event causes a change.
Sending 'n' PM_SUSPEND events because you have 'n' listeners on
/dev/apm_bios seems to be a waste of time when it could be handled
more cleanly.
