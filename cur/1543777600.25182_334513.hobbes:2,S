Could tty_io.c be all that changed by a small set of red-hat patches to
2.6.9?  Why would they need to go in there to make so many changes in the
first place?  Which 2.6 release changed tty_io.c's use of tty_sem so
heavily?
This conflict between main-line/redhat looks much worse than the unix sysV
r4.0 divergence after 3.2. Ouch.
Thanks for your help, though.  karl m
