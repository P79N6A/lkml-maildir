Not quite: if you do that underneath ll_rw_block, then the completion
interrupt needs to be able to do the final copy on a read request, and
that needs a separate kmap in case the interrupt occurred in the middle
of a foreground process using its own kmap.

Yes, and that is exactly what we'll need in the long term.  We will
still need bounce buffers for some devices, but a lot of devices will be
able to live without them.

If the entire page cache can now live outside of the va space, that is
still a *large* net increase in the usable kernel va!

Yep.
One last thing, Andrea: are you planning on fixing kswapd for bigmem?
Right now 2.3.16's kswapd doesn't check what kinds of memory are free.
If we have a lot of free high-memory pages and no low-memory space free,
then kswapd will stand idly by while the network layers are starved of
memory.  That's a _bad_ bug in the bigmem as it stands.  I'll fix this
next week if you aren't already working on it.
