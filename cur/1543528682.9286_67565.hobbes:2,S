No.  The main job of the msp34xx chips is to decode the TV audio signal
(FM Stereo/NICAM/BTSC/whatever) and provide stereo sound.  There is no
need to register within soundcore to provide this functionality.
Registering the chip as mixer for volume/bass/treble settings is
just a optional goodie because the chip can do it also.  volume
settings are also available throuth the v4l interface.
