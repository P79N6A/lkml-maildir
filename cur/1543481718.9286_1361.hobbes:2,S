Note that if you have a thrashing process, then by far the most
important factor to tune is the aggressiveness with which that process
charges through new pages.  It doesn't matter how many pages you try to
keep free: if you have any process which is trying to gobble them all,
then it is far more important to throttle the rate at which they can do
so than to have any hard and fast limits on freeable pages.  Otherwise,
you just end up freeing lots of pages for the thrashing task(s) to
reclaim them straight back.
This is what I mean by being tuned by the load, not by predetermined
limits.
