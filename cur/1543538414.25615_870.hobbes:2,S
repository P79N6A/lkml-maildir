Hi,
I have a COMPAQ Proliant dual proc PC and I have a lot of problems ->
1.
	Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82557 [Ethernet Pro 100] (rev 05)
	under 2.4.0-test2 kernel everything is fine with that card, it works
	under 2.4.0-test3 (tried pre2 and pre5) the very same card spits
		eepro100: wait_for_cmd_done timeout!
	errors and nothing goes through that card
2.
	SMP motherboard not detected. Using dummy APIC emulation.
	meaning that second CPU isn't booted.
All other relevant informations are available on request. (lspci, dmesg or whatever)
