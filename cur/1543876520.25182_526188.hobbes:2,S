ok, thanks for double-checking that.

i tried your workload and i think i managed to optimize it some more: i 
have uploaded the -rt8 kernel with these improvements included - could 
you try it? Is there any measurable improvement relative to -rt5?
one more thing to improve netperf performance is to do this before 
running it:
  chrt -f -p 50 $$
this will put netperf on the same priority level as the net hardirq and 
the net softirq (which both default to SCHED_FIFO:50), and should result 
in a (much) reduced context-switch rate.
Or, if networking is not latency-critical, then you could move the net 
hardirq and softirq threads to SCHED_BATCH, and run netperf under 
SCHED_BATCH as well, using:
  chrt -b -p 0 $$
and figuring out the active softirq hardirq thread PIDs and "chrt -b" 
-ing them too.
