AFAIK there is no spec yet. Just supporting 64bit DMA on 32bit hosts would 
probably only minor changes (like pushing the dma_mask flag a bit more out so
that it is visible by scsi or ll_rw_blk), but 2.5 will probably also see more
extensive changes for block drivers, like moving them to kiovecs.  
Your input would be probably welcome.
