<SNIP>
I have an Adaptec AVA<something>or other card, and it doesn't work at all
unless I insert -DSKIP_BIOSTEST in the Makefile in /usr/src/linux/drivers/scsi
this is for both 2.0.x and 2.2.x (with x being 0 at the moment - it's hard
to update when you have to use zips). Is it possible to make it fallback
without a recompile as I would have assumed this could bite many people.
Or maybe I'm doing something wrong <shrug>.
