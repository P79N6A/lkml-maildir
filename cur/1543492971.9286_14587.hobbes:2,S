Given the amount of trouble we have coping with problematic tcp
interactions right now, I can't begin to imagine how much worse things
would be if we had a dozen different configurable tcp behaviours in
the stack.  From a kernel maintenance point of view, this is just
several disasters heaped on top of each other waiting to happen.
