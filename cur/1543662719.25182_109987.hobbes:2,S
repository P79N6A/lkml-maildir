 Think of "timer events" as a single TCP connection, so you have...
time X: empty
time X+Y: timed event "Arrives"
time X+Z: timed event "Arrives"
...at which point it's pretty obvious that if you "poll" the timer
event queue from anytime before X+Y it'll be empty, and anytime after
X+Y it'll be "full". There isn't any point in being able to distinguish
between the events X+Y and X+Z, you only need to know a timed event has
occurred so you should process all timed events that are needed.
 At which point you just need to work out the difference between X and
X+Y, and pass that to poll/sigtimedwait/etc.
