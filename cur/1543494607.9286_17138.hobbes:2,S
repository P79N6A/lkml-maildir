Let me throw in another idea:
I would like to register the module upon initialization by init/main.c just
as modules are registered by their name and reported by /proc/modules. This
would allow for something like /proc/components to report all statically
linked kernel parts. 
Upon insertion of a module by insmod, we would check both lists, whether the
module is already there and preventing it from being loaded twice (maybe
modules where it is allowed can set a flag to prevent this).
This would also solve some issues with modules being inserted in spite of
static code being compiled into the kernel. 
[Try it with scsi_mod, but sync and remount ro before.]
