Probably that once in a while, we should set up a complete tree in a
tar.bz2 format on kernel.org. It would help a lot of people behind small
pipes. I have been encountering problems with git-clone when the link is
unstable. After the smallest error, it erases everything and you have to
retry from start, which is quite frustrating and expensive.
At least, downloading a tar.bz2 with FTP would be easier and a lot more
reliable. Also, people could download it from their workplace and bring
it home.
