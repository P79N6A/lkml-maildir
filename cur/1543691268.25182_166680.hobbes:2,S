The test was on a pentium 4, so its only removing the extra code.
I think Andi's patch is required (especially because it fixes
userspace), and under the current cpu selection scheme, it is
implemented correctly (although I am now at a loss as to what the
generic thing is for).
The conditional compilation thing is a seperate issue. This patch may
have just broken a few camels' backs.
What is intriguing to me is the "Its only a 2% slowdown of the page
fault for every cpu other than K[78] for this single workaround. There
is no point to conditional compilation" attitude some people have.
Of course, its only 2% on a pagefault, not anywhere near 2% of kernel
performance as a whole, so maybe that is justified.
Just repeating though, that is a seperate issue and I think Andi's patch
is needed.
