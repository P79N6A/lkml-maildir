Philosophical issues aside (I suppose everyone on this list prefers to
see drivers free) the main point that decides if a driver has to be
released with source is whether it can be considered a derived work or
not.  to the best of my knowledge, the exception for binary modules in
the kernel was mainly to provide for drivers ported from other operating
systems, rather than to allow for competlely new drivers to be kept
closed source.  If the driver can be claimed to be developed without
having access to other things than header-files, it can probably be
considered non-derived, but a drivers that has to modify the
sys_call_table is dangerously close to being a derived work (if not
already past the border-line...)
