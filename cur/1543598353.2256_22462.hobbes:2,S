No.  The problem Intel boxes do use Phoenix BIOS.  His box is the exact 
problem model.  It requires the use of IOAPIC support for UP or SMP in 
order to work properly.  If 2.4.8 and 2.4.9 both work correctly now 
*without* the use of UP-IOAPIC and without SMP, then that means in 2.4.8 
there must have been added a DMI scan whitelist entry that makes this 
motherboard do something sane (like never trying to assign interrupts or 
enabling UP-IOAPIC even if it isn't the default).
