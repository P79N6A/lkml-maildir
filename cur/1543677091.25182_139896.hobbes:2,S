Now, after further investigation, it seems reverting the pci-init-ordering-fix 
is not necessary... I simply had to switch off ACPI (for example with the 
'acpi=off' kernel parameter).
I recognized it because the changed kernel had the problems again if i started 
it with 'pci=noacpi', but not with 'acpi=off'. So I tried the original -mm8 
kernel with this option and... IT WORKS!
So perhaps it is better to leave this patch in the -mm tree and fix ACPI 
(which does not work for me anyway).
