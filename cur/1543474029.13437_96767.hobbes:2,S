Not without hacking. You would need to allocate a profiling buffer on
module loading, and extend x86_do_profile (or the equivalent on the
platform you're using) to search a table of these secondary buffers.
The profiler puts out-of-bound EIP values into the last histogram slot,
so you see at least when your module runs @)
