Alan,
The issue with my (mostly) PAGE_SIZE RAW IO patch is, it could generate
buffer heads with different b_size in a single IO request. Jens & Ben
have concerns about some of the low level drivers not able to handle
these. (it would be hard to analyse all the drivers to verify this).
So, Andrea suggested we add a flag in "blk_dev" structure. Only the
drivers which support variable size buffer heads in a single IO will
set it. My RAW VARY patch will use this flag to see if I can do 
RAW VARY or not. Makes sense ?
Let me know, what you think about this approach.
Regards,
Badari
