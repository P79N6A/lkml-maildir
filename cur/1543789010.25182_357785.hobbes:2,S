I'm not too fond of this new booted_core variable. How about
you just put the true number of cores into x86_num_cores? 
What should x86_num_cores be in your setup anyways if not
"booted cores"? 
Also I must admit the number of different variables to keep
track of multicore and siblingness starts to become mindboggling,
so I would recommend you add a fat overview comment somewhere
that describes their definition and relationship. Or better put
something into Documentation, it is probably as confusing for 
user space /proc/cpuinfo consumer too.
