FWIW, I'm not keen about the format strings either, but they don't
constitute a performance hit beyond an additional parameter.  It does
not need to actually get parsed at run time.

Note that this is for the unoptimized case.  The immediate-value code
is better.  I have still yet to see some good measurements of how much
the overheads of the various variants are, however.  It's only fair to
gather these numbers and continue the debate with them in hand.

This has been answered several times before.  It's because the marker
parameters have to be (conditionally) evaluated and pushed onto a call
frame.  It's not just a call that would need being nop'd, but a whole
function call setup/teardown sequence, which itself can be interleaved
with adjacent code.
