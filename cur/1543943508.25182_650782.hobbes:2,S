VM is livelocking if too many page are pinned that way right now. The 
higher the processors per node the higher the risk of livelock because 
more processors are in the process of cycling through pages that have an 
elevated refcount.

Rik has a patchset under development that addresses issues like this. The 
elevated refcount pin problem is not really relevant to the patchset we 
are discussing here.
