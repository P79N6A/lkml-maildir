Mathias Kretschmer posted a patch several months ago, and Daniel Drake
reposted it on August 30th if you check the archive. Bartlomiej was
asked to respond to/merge it but if he responded I didn't see it so it
was probably a private reply.
You can pull it from the Gentoo tree and it'll drop into other vendor
trees cleanly.
