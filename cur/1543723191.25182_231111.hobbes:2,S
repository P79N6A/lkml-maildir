Building linux-2.6.7 on a case-insensitive filesystem is currently not  
possible, because the build system requires the two files:
arch/$(ARCH)/kernel/vmlinux.lds.s
arch/$(ARCH)/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S
whose filename differ only in case.
Here is a patch which fixes this, by changing the build system to  
use"vmlinux.lds.asm" instead of "vmlinux.lds.s":

build_on_case_insensitive_fs-1.patch
Please consider applying.
Thanks,
Martin Schaffner
