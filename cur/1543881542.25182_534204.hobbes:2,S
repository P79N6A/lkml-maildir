Is it actually "not working" though, even at the hardware level? To my 
knowledge those noises are normal, and aren't even signs of a harware 
problem. I believe it is the natural result of changing frequencies at any 
time. If you change frequencies, especially in the low end of available 
frequencies, you should hear a very brief noise. A governor such as 
ondemand, which is rapidly switching the frequency from say, 333 MHz to 
2.66 GHz, is likely to make this much more noticable.
