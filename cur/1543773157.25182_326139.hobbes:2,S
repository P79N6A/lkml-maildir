Subject: 2.6.12-rc6 missing commit(s) in cpufreq?

According to:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/ChangeLog-2.6.12-rc6
There should be a:
commit 1206aaac285904e3e3995eecbf4129b6555a8973
Author: Dave Jones <davej@redhat.com>
Date:   Tue May 31 19:03:48 2005 -0700
    [CPUFREQ] Allow ondemand stepping to be changed by user.
And when I look at:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/davej/cpufreq.git;a=commit;h=1206aaac285904e3e3995eecbf4129b6555a8973
There are changes in the diff like:
--- drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_ondemand.c
+++ drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_ondemand.c
@@ -79,6 +79,7 @@ struct dbs_tuners {
unsigned int up_threshold;
unsigned int down_threshold;
unsigned int ignore_nice;
+ unsigned int freq_step;
};
Problem is that neither a clean 2.6.11 patched with patch-2.6.12-rc6 nor
a full linux-2.6.12-rc6.tar.bz (I just downloaded it) contain that
commit.
The first example from above looks like:
struct dbs_tuners {
        unsigned int            sampling_rate;
        unsigned int            sampling_down_factor;
        unsigned int            up_threshold;
        unsigned int            ignore_nice;
};
Even more strange is the other discrepancies in that list, suggesting
other missed commits. Live directory from 2.6.12-rc :
root:sleipner:/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/ondemand# ls
total 0
0 ignore_nice           0 sampling_rate      0 sampling_rate_min
0 sampling_down_factor  0 sampling_rate_max  0 up_threshold
Perhaps this is why I can't get the conservative governor to work at all
(it just sits at the freq at which it was loaded, never going up/down no
matter the load).
