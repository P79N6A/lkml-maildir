Could you please provide a detailed list of the
problems you have with shm_open? If they are
valid, then I can bet the patch will be applied,
no matter what. :)

In this case you need to use shm_unlink() right
after shm_open(). Then this shm will be accessable
only to your process and its children, via an fd,
and not to anyone else. And you still can do anything
with it (ftruncate/mmap/mremap whatever).

In what way, exactly?
