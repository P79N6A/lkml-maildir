Swapping too much probably has a lot to do with a particular hard drive
and its performace. Is there any way of adding a configurable option (via
sysctl) to allow the adminstrators to tune how aggressively the kernel
swaps out data/vs throwing out the disk cache (so if it is set to
agressive, the kernel will try hard to make sure to use swap to free up
memory, or if it is set to conservative it will try to free disk cache (to
a limit) instead of swapping stuff out to free memory)
