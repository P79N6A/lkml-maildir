Thanks for the info.  Did you get any performance results for before and
after?  I did try Ingo's patch a while back, and I experienced about a 8%
drop in performance.  I did not have hyperthreading on, just a simple case
comparing balance to no balance.  The overhead of the ioapic programming was
too high.  Increasing the time between reroutes by 20 got me back to the
same performance as no balancing at all.  I intend to test his patch again,
along with Andrea's next.
