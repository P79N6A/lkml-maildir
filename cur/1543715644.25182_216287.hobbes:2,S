as you said the only real goal of the device in request_firmware() is to
provide us with a unique path to the "loading" and "data" files. The
advantage of having the device linked is currently not used by the
firmware.agent script and I don't think that it ever will be used.
However you can take a look at 2.4, where the device parameter is only a
string. So what is wrong with letting request_firmware() create a dummy
and temporary device that is not related to any hardware?
Regards
Marcel
