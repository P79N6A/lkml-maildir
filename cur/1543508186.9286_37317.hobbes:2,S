lock-kernel is exactly what it says: lock kernel via global kernel lock.
Not from other processes on other processes but from processes on the same
processor also. It was invented way before Linus even dreamed about SMP...

Since kernel lock is NOT protecting everything. Initially just one kernel lock
protected everything in kernel. It was not SMP-friendly. So global kernel lock
was replaced by bunch of smaller locks. Some things are still protected by
global lock but some things need personal lock (things access for which are
time-critical mostly)... It's not trivial change since you need to take care
about potential deadlock situations...
