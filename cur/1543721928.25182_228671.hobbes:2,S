Sorry, I should have noticed.
Anyway, it looks like a pattern is forming which smells bad to me.
Apparently, we have:
1) A serious error condition that occurs on Seagate SATA drives connected to 
Silicon Image controllers.
2) As of today we can say that it only occurs on Seagate drives (Ricky, do I 
remember correctly that you see faulty behavior of such drives with a 3ware 
RAID?).
3) The error is reported by the kernel like that:
ata1: DMA timeout, stat 0x1
ATA: abnormal status 0x58 on port 0xCF819087
scsi0: ERROR on channel 0, id 0, lun 0, CDB: Read (10) 00 00 03 ca 47 00 00 00 
00
Current sda: sense key Medium Error
Additional sense: Unrecovered read error - auto reallocate failed
end_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 248391
Afterwards, the drive blocks its SATA bus in a "busy" mode and cannot be 
accessed by any means (ie. hardware reset is necessary).
4) The most "reliable" way to trigger this condition is to copy a lot of data 
(eg. 2 GB) to the drive in one shot.
Do we agree on that?
