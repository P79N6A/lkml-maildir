Hi Greg,
PitBull LX for Linux source patches have been available at 
www.argusrevolution.com. After the tragic event of Sept 11, Argus has 
temporarily suspended the operation of this web site. I am sorry for the 
inconvenience this may have caused. The Argus PitBull LX for Linux 
patches for Linux will be available shortly at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pitbull-lx
Thanks for your understanding,
Chad Hanson
