You really don't want every changeset as a patch :-/
Please talk to Jeramy, or someone else running penguinppc.org. At one 
point we had patches being generated for every changesets. It got to be 
too much of a headache.
Write some scripts to generage a patch every week or so, and we'll put it 
up.
What I'd really like is some kind of one-way bk->$OTHER_SCM mirror setup 
simply so people can pull stuff out without BK.
