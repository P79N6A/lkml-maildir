I'll send that off-line upon request.  FWIW, it's not the original boot 
dmesg output however, but one a freshly booted system...
As luck would have it, just as I was collecting the data, there was a major 
explosion.  Box was slogging through glibc make check, and when it hit the 
mutex tests in nptl, KaBOOM.  Ding-dong-dead box... [reboot] oh my, seems 
repeatable.  Guess I'll see if I can find my serial console cable instead 
of typing make install as originally planned :)
