Absolutely.

I'm sure some reasonable rules could be determined.  Maybe you'd need to 
be the owner of the file to get the extra info, with root able to 
monitor everything.
Maybe there should be a way to load plugins into inotify (something like 
netfilter) so that people load modules to send themselves whatever 
information they want...
Let's get it in first though before thinking too hard about extra stuff.
