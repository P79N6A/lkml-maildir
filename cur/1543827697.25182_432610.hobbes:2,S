Yes, you have some sort of a broken middlebox in your path (firewall, 
transparent proxy, or similar) that doesn't correctly handle window 
scaling.  Check out this thread: 
<http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-netdev&m=114478312100641&w=2>.
The best thing you can do is try to find this broken box and inform its 
owner that it needs to be fixed.  (If you can find out what it is, I'd 
be interested to know.)  In the meantime, disabling window scaling will 
work around the problem for you.
