There is something really wrong with this patch (or my hardware).

I get a lot of "end_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 31834343" messages.
I checked sda with badblocks and everything seems to be fine
/sbin/badblocks -o /root/sda.badblocks -v /dev/sda
Sprawdzanie bloków od 0 do 156290904
Poszukiwanie wadliwych bloków (tylko odczyt): done
Przebieg zakończony, znaleziono 0 wadliwych bloków.
(/root/sda.badblocks is empty)
BTW. sda is a new Seagate SATA II HDD atached to ICH5 (SATA I) controller.

Michal
