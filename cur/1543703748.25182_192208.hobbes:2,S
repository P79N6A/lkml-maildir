Yes, I do not propose that you remove the noise today.
But nothing is wrong.
Several utilities access the keyboard directly. (For example X and kbdrate.)
Since setting keyboard rate and starting X are rather common actions,
most people will see these messages a few times in their syslog.
A few months from now, when we are satisfied that the keyboard code
is in perfect shape, these messages can be silenced by default.
