Really? I can't find any drivers that seem to do this. The only calls to 
pci_set_power_state seem to be in the suspend, resume, init and exit 
routines.

I'd certainly agree that that's the right thing to do, but userspace has 
a habit of using whatever functionality /is/ available to get to a given 
end. The semantics of the device/power/state file were never made 
terribly clear, and it did have the desired effect of suspending the 
device. Removing it without providing warning or a transition pathway is 
a pain.

Agreed.
