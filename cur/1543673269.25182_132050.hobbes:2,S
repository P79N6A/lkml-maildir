You are ignoring the host side of things. PATA TCQ is basically
unsupportable without some hardware support (auto-poll). It's my
understanding that all SATA controllers do that.
Then there's the debate of whether TCQ is worth it at all, in general. I
feel that a few tags just to minimize the time spent when ending a
request to starting a new one is nice.

I agree, besides it just needs a bit of fixing, can't be much.
