Hi all,
I have a question regarding serial console support in Linux. Specifically,
does anyone know if there is any way to get serial console support without
using lilo? Specifically, by making kernel mods to redirect console output
to com1?
Here's my company's issue. As I understand it, you compile console support
into the kernel, and on bootup, if lilo sees the "serial=" option and the
"append=console=" option into lilo.conf, it will check the video adaptor,
if there is not a probed video adaptor sitting there, it will then redirect
console output to the serial port. We're using a boot floppy for some
installs out in the field, and the floppy does not have enough room for
lilo on the floppy, and we can't remove anything else. So we can't use lilo.
Thoughts? Solutions? Any help would be very much appreciated. If possible,
please also cc: any responses to me at erich@pobox.com, since this is
pretty time-critical. Thanks in advance for any help anyone can provide.
Eric
