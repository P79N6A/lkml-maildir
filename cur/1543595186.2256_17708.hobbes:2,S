glad to know this, i do wonder how does /usr/bin/ld work for red hat.
to my old mentality this seems red hat is going out of any resonable
standard.

It is my own curiosity. yes if you could send me the direcotory tree of
your /usr. Just to see. Actually i know none using red hat 7.X to whom i
could ask to check, they are all slackware addicted.

mmm!
Again I am confused. how can the linker work?

I would not be so scared, if you set a LD_PRELOAD_LIBRARY to
/lib/libc.so.6, you willse any binary will run anyway, because it would be
too mutch
if the same libc stripped would not run library, and they HAVE to mantein
a libc.so.6 linside of /lib, otherway this would be too mutch against
a resonable standard.
I would be happy if some guy from red hat could explain what is going on.
