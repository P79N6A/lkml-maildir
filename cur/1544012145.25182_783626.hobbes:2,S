Quoting Sukadev Bhattiprolu (sukadev@linux.vnet.ibm.com):

> Container-init must behave like global-init to processes within the
> container and hence it must be immune to unhandled fatal signals from
> within the container (i.e SIG_DFL signals that terminate the process).
> 
> But the same container-init must behave like a normal process to 
> processes in ancestor namespaces and so if it receives the same fatal
> signal from a process in ancestor namespace, the signal must be
> processed.
> 
> Implementing these semantics requires that send_signal() determine pid

Tested sending signals to a custom container-init.
Are you planning to address Oleg's comments with a new patch-set,
or with patches on top of this set?
thanks,
