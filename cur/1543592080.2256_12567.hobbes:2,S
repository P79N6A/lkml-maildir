Hi
              I  am comfronting with a macro __asm__ . What is the meaning of
this. I cannot find the definition of this. I need the meaning of this line
 __asm__("and	1 %%esp.%0; ":"=r" (current) : "0" (~8191UL));
                       This is defined inside the get_current()	in current.h
Thanks in advance
                           by
                                     Blesson
