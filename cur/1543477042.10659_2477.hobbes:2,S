   Is 16-bit -- ouch. It really needs to be 32-bit. I don't get how this
   occured, glibc uses 32-bit pid_t everywhere except here. 
   My best solution so far, is break this API before it gets too
   ingrained in code out there (which sucks, because this will break
   sybase, which rocks).
We can fix this without forcing people to recompile and without forcing
a major version number bump on the shared library by using ELF symbol
versioning.  Eric Youngdale did a presentation on this one or two Linux
Expo's ago, but as far as I know no one has attempted to actually use
this to rev a libc interface to date.  This would be a good test case, I
think.
