Hmm, those ones have slipped through - I'll fix those up, thanks.
The vast majority of zone alloc/free uses are via the other style,
many variables are named according to those interfaces, etc, etc.

Not without a very convincing argument, and "just kill wrappers
without even looking at the existing code" hasn't made me very
enthusiastic so far.
Regarding __GFP_NOFAIL, there are some situations where that could
be used now, and others where it should not be - it'd take a very
careful code audit and evidence of a level of low-memory-condition
testing done, etc, before such a change would be merged.  Note that
the -mm tree currently has a rework of the way incore extents are
managed within XFS, which significantly changes (in a good way) the
nature of the allocation requests we make (and hence I'm _really_,
_really_ not interested in cosmetic patches in this area just now).
cheers.
