Yep this all makes sense. I was looking at it from the other angle where
on some workloads we have to force malloc to use brk for best
performance. Im sure the MADV_FREE changes will close that gap but it
would be interesting to see if there is still a gap on the problem
workloads. Maybe Im worrying about nothing.
