This patch was written by Martin Bligh.
It changes all references of node_start_paddr and zone_start_paddr 
to node_start_pfn and zone_start_pfn.  This change is required to support PAE
for i386 discontigmem.  A version of this patch is in the 2.4 aa tree.
Here's Martin's previous discussion regarding these changes:

http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=101925421326030&w=2
I've tested this patch on the following configurations: UP, SMP, SMP PAE, 
multiquad, multiquad PAE, multiquad DISCONTIGMEM, multiquad DISCONTIGMEM PAE.
Any and all feedback regarding this patch is greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Pat
