ACPI modules provide the name of the device that they want to bind to in
the .ids section of the acpi_driver structure. Currently this
information isn't made available in module.aliases - nor does the
information from the DSDT seem to make its way into /sys anywhere. If
these two issues were fixed, it would be possible for hotplug to
autoload acpi modules on boot.
The first of these is fairly easy to fix - it just requires a macro to
populate a MODULE_ALIAS table during module building. The second sounds
more awkward. Is this a desirable goal, and if so what's the best way of
approaching it?
