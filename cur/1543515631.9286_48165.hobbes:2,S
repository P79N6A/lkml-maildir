Subject: [OT] where can I find a kernel debugger for 2.3?

Usually, I used a patched up version of gdbstub, but with 2.3.26, it
frequently crashes the target computer.
I found the kdb patch on SGI's page, but only for 2.2.10 - where can I
find a newer version?
Or where can I find a newer version of gdbstub/kGDB?
Thanks,
	Manfred
