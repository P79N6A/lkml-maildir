It is trying to allocate lowmem, but you have none left (and none
to speak of can be reclaimed).
I'd guess you have a kernel memory leak. Can you start by posting
the output of /proc/slabinfo and /proc/meminfo after the machine has
been up for 10-20 days (eg. close to OOM). And preferably also post
another set after just a day or so uptime.
Are you using the SLAB or SLUB allocator (check .config).
The kernel crashes (rather than recovers) because the leak has used
up all its working memory and killing processes does not release it.
(by the looks).
Thanks for the report,
Nick
