I'd rather work on my Bluetooth stuff for now :)
The reason I looked at the ATM stuff is that I got this DSL thing from 
PacBell that
came with Alcatel ADSL USB modem which talks to the ATM layer. The guy who
wrote that USB driver had a comment that it doesn't work on SMP for 
_unknown reason_ :)
Quick glance at the ATM code, revealed that one of reasons is messed up 
looking.
So I fixed device registration and now it works. But ATM locking in general 
has to be fixed.
