For the [sym/ncr]53c8xx driver, you must refer to:

I have 1 Atlas 1, 2 Atlas 2 and 1 Atlas 4. The Atlas 4 is a lot better,
but the driver copes with all these drives.

You get with Quantum Atlas < 4 drives in mono-initiator what you get with
any other drive in multi-initiator environment. A SCSI subsystem that can
work in multi-initiator environment must work with Quantum drives.

I does lie only if you enable write behind caching and FUA bit is not set 
for writes, which is correct.

The suggested method is to wait for a command completion from the
offending device prior to requeuing any subsequent command to this device. 
The sym53c8xx driver does shrink its internal device queue depth up to the
number of _actually_ disconnect commands which has the _same_ effect. 
Then, the device queue depth will be incremented later based on some fixed
amount of _successful_ commands. This scales quite well with a very low
overhead. This has been implemented and tuned based on the behaviour of 
Atlas drives.

I have such a 10000 rpm drive. I use it with 32 tags under Linux and 64
tags under FreeBSD. No problem.
Btw, the Viking II from Quantum also supports such an amount of tagged
commands (may-be only 63, but it is equivalent). This depends mostly on 
the firmware.
