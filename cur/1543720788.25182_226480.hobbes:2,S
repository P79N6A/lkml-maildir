hello
problem with 2.6.7-rc3 and asus a7n8x nforce2 board is here that
the C1 disconnect fix is not applied anymore after booting.
-rc2 worked OK without any lockups.
i understand that the new fix in -rc3 checks an bios option
to enable the fixup but the a7n8x bios does not have such option.
so it would be nice to have the possibility to force the fixup, because
it worked really fine here before.
thanks,
lars
