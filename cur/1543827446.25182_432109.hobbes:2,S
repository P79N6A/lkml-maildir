Of course it would be much more useful (at least for the more
knowing/interested folks) if the user can specify "legitimate" email
(i.e. for the whole email address, not only th domain part).
This can be done since years with PGP-signatures but almost no one is
really using ist. And this requires understanding of PGP etc. - which is
unfortunately not the case for everyone.
So any simpler (but also reliable enough) scheme needs to be defined.
