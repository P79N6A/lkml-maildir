If the bursts are short enough, it will be more work to
load the data into cache on another CPU than to do the
calculations 'locally'.
When it doesn't make sense to move the work to another
CPU, it won't make sense to force it there. OTOH, when
the amount of work is big enough, it _will_ get run on
multiple CPUs in parrallel.
