OK. In this case udev creates links based on MBR signature; it can be used to 
infer real device:
{pts/0}% LC_ALL=C ll /dev/disk/by-id
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root  9 Apr 12 21:36 edd-int13_dev80 -> ../../hda
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 10 Apr 12 21:36 edd-int13_dev80-part1 -> ../../hda1
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 10 Apr 12 21:36 edd-int13_dev80-part2 -> ../../hda2
Not sure about USB either.
