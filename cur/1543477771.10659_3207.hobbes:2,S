| What is your NFS server? It looks like your NFS server returns

I just got this message from a Solaris-2.5.1 NFS server.  
I'm also having the following problem:  when I try to read my mail
using NM's `inc' command, `inc' just hangs until I kill it.  The mail
drop file is on a Sun 4.1.4 NFS server.  Meanwhile, on the Sun 4.1.4
server several `procmail' processes start to accumulate because they
can't write to my mail drop file.  I assume they're waiting for a lock 
to be released.
Since I'm mounting the file file system with the `nolock' option, how
can this happen?  Could statd be causing this problem?
