OK, so it seems this is a moderately deep broken assumption in usbfs.

I'm still hoping that one of the folk who want make an interesting and
useful contribution to Linux will take the hint.  It goes slowly. :)
Right now I think a "usbfs 1.5" would be the simplest way to deliver
it ... an ioctl that returns a new per-endpoint file descriptor.  It'd
need to support the AIO calls and a bit more ... and that could be the
guts of a "usbfs2".  The "gadgetfs" code shows how small that part
could be ... and later, some libfs based code could do all the fun
stuff, creating a real "usbfs2" that exports normal per-endpoint files
and so on.  Then we could deprecate the current AIO stuff...

Other than tying up the file descriptor with a blocking read, that is.

*cough* usbfs2 aio *cough*

Sounds reasonable, except that not all such tasks will want the signal.
Though I guess the infrastructure to filter the signal out already exists,
so the main missing piece is that urb-to-file binding.
