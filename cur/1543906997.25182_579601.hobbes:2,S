Actually, this GPIO API has been added to the upstream in -RC1. In this
pull, Michael's patch just enable it in arch code and driver. And it is
tested at least 2-3 weeks, I think it is OK for the -RC merge.
And most our driver things are moved to depend on this new GPIO API. I
just wanna make thing easier to maintain.
Thanks Mike
