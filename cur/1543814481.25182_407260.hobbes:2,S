I think you're right, and you are consistent with the sequence when
try_to_release_page is called from elsewhere.
But the last time I had anything to do with try_to_release_page was
way back in 2.5.mid, I don't think there was a pagevec_strip then.
Andrew will know better.
I can't see what protects the default drop_buffers case against this,
so can't argue that it's an XFS problem.
But wouldn't you, on balance, be better off repeating the
PagePrivate test within the lock?
		if (PagePrivate(page) && !TestSetPageLocked(page)) {
			if (PagePrivate(page))
				try_to_release_page(page, 0);
			unlock_page(page);
		}
