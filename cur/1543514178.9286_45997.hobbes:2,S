Yes, John forgot to mention that we're assuming boot from a read-only 
media such as a write-protected floppy or CD-ROM.  We also assume 
that the rc scripts, kernel, and all modules to be loaded at boot 
time (before of course the sealing module) also reside on that medium.
About your last point, yes, root can do a lot of nasty things, but by 
sealing the kernel at least they are constrained to what's available 
through kernel services.  That may help presumably by disabling a lot 
of stuff in the running kernel.
