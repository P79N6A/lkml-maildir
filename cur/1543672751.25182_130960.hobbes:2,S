What really gets to me is that *you* wrote in
(
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.5/ChangeLog-2.5.41
):
        3. Intercept system calls
	OProfile (and intel's vtune which is similar in function) used to do this;
	however what they really need is a notification on certain
	events (exec() mostly). The way modules do this is store the original
	function pointer, install a new one that calls the old one after storing
	whatever info they need. This mechanism breaks badly in the light of
	multiple such modules doing this versus modules
	unloading/uninstalling their handlers (by restoring their saved pointer
	that may or may not point to a valid handler anymore).
	Eg the use of the export in this just a bandaid due to lack of a
	proper mechanism, and also incorrect and crash prone.
So what you're saying here is not that you object to having people doing
syscall hooks, just that operating on the syscall_table symbol directly
is error prone (to which I wholeheartedly agree). 
Then you reject a "proper mechanism".....
