As far as GRU is concerned, performance is the same as with your patch
(Jack can confirm).

If RDMA/IB folks needed to block in invalidate_range, I guess they
need to do so on top of tmpfs too, and that never worked with your
patch anyway.

The whole point is that your solution fits only GRU and KVM too.
XPMEM in your patch works in a hacked mode limited to anonymous memory
only, Robin already received incoming mail asking to allow xpmem to
work on more than anonymous memory, so your solution-that-fits-all
doesn't actually fit some of Robin's customer needs. So if it doesn't
even entirely satisfy xpmem users, imagine the other potential
blocking-users of this code.

anon_vma lock can remain a spinlock unless you also want to schedule
inside try_to_unmap.
If converting the i_mmap_lock to a mutex is a big trouble, another way
that might work to allow invalidate_range to block, would be to try to
boost the mm_users to prevent the mmu_notifier_release to run in
another cpu the moment after i_mmap_lock spinlock is unlocked. But
even if that works, it'll run slower and the mmu notifiers RCU locking
should be switched to a mutex, so it'd be nice to have it as a
separate option.
