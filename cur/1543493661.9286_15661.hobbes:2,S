Well, if you are mounting shares which live on the Win95 machine, you
might want to consider enabling the Win95 Bug Workaround in the kernel. 
If, however, you are *not* mounting shares exported by Win95
(specifically Win95), i.e., shares on an NT server or on another OS or
Linux, then make sure you *don't* have the Bug Workaround enabled.  I
don't have Win95 anymore (Thank you God!), but still run NT, so can't
really tell you how well the Workaround works.
BTW, what do you use to test the performance?
