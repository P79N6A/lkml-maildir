Subject: [PATCH] Rename "swapper" to "idle"
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/20/333

This patch renames the "swapper" process (pid 0) to a more appropriate name "idle". The name "swapper" is not obviously meaningful and confuses a lot of people (e.g., when seen in oops report).
Patch not tested, but I guess it works. :-)
