glibc could also return to run the syscall without waiting again from the
beginning by looking at the 'struct timespec *rem'. If there wouldn't be
the `rem` parameter in nanosleep, glibc couldn't wrap the -EINTR
trasparently. But there is.
NOTE: I can as well fix the kernel for this, but I agree with Peter that
returning -INTR looks like the right thing to do. (I don't know which is
the official semantic for the syscall though)
