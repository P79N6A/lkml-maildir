Unhappy with this latest O16.3-O17int patch I'm withdrawing it, and 
recommending nothing on top of O16.3 yet.
More and more it just seems to be a bandaid to the priority inverting spin on 
waiters, and it does seem to be of detriment to general interacivity. I can 
now reproduce some loss of interactive feel with O17. 
Something specific for the spin on waiters is required that doesn't affect 
general performance. The fact that I can reproduce the same starvation in 
vanilla 2.6.0-test3 but to a lesser extent means this is an intrinsic problem 
that needs a specific solution.
