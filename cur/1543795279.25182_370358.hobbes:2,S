Searching around some, I see that OS X has st_gen, but the man page I
found says it is only available for super-user.  It also appears that
AIX and at least some of the BSDs have it (which would make sense I
guess as Tru64, OS X, and IIRC AIX are all BSD derived).
Also, I ses someone pitched it to linux-kernel several years ago but it
didn't appear to go anywhere.  Maybe time to rethink that?
