What would be useful is to know under what situations that board can
raise NMI 30.

The first thing to find out is to find out in which kernel the behaviour
is introduced. It might also be worth disabling msi in case Intel screwed
the board up somewhat.

See if 2.6.20.* with the 2.6.18 driver compiles and how that behaves.
Also see if pci=nomsi and/or pci=nommconf make a difference.
