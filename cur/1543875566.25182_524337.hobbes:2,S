To work out whether the page was dirtied via write (in which case the
timestamps were updated) or via mmap (in which case they were not).

It might not be there any more - the ptes could have got taken down by, for
example, reclaim.
I dunno - I'm not trying very hard.  I'm trying to encourage you to come up
with something less costly and less complex than this thing, but you appear
to be resisting.

We can treat MS_ASYNC as we treat MS_SYNC.  Then, MS_ASYNC *does* walk the
pages.  Is does it in generic_writepages().  It also even walks the ptes
for you, in clear_page_dirty_for_io().
There is surely no need to duplicate all that.
