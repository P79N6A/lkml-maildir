The CDROM was showing up in the POST in all cases.
It turns out the problem (as I outlined in a followup post) resulted from a
combination of issues.
 1) This board uses a Marvell PATA controller, so the relevant driver must
    be configured.
 2) Unless the "Configure SATA as" setting in the BIOS is set to "AHCI" the
    PATA controller won't be found.  Sounds a bit odd and counter-intuitive,
    but that's what's happening.  Originally this item was set to IDE; the
    other option is RAID but I haven't tested that.
