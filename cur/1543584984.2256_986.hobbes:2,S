Hi,
The solution is not to go down the path2inst road, that is full of 
its own traps.  You want volume labels via a volume manager (do lvm and raid
already do this?) and/or filesystem labels (see e2fslabel).  This won't solve
all of the ills associated with device instance changes, but it will certainly
address the biggest one.
