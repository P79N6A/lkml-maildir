I don't see what you are saying in that message.  Ricardo agreed it had a
race condition and said he would, at some future point, redo it, but I
never saw a new patch.

Nobody points to any issues, ever, when this happens.  Look at how broken
the v4l2 only bttv driver was.  You still can't unload and load cx88-dvb
since Markus's patch for hotplug, no one's fixed that regression.  Now
there's yet another race in the cx88 subdriver code.  Maybe the original
author who added that code should feel some motiviation to fix the
regressions it caused....
The only complaints that are ever generated on commits to the development
enviroment are political, "so-and-so shouldn't be able to patch my
fiefdom."

I don't have the time or the desire to be the janitor who cleans up after
sloppy coders' bugs.
