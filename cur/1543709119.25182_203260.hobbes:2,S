But `w` just reads /var/run/utmp to see who's logged on. It reads
/proc for info. If you just killed all the tasks as you state,
(with KILL instead of TERM) utmp probably doesn't have logout
entries. This seems like a `w` problem, not a kernel problem.
The pts ttys will get recycled just like pids. There is no
error here either.
