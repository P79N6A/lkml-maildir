So you pick up 0->1 refcount transitions.

SetPageFreeing is only done in shrink_list(), so other pages in the
buddy bitmaps and/or pagecache pages freed by other methods may not
be found by this. There's also likely trouble with higher-order pages.

page != *pagep won't be reliably tripped unless the pagecache
modification has the appropriate memory barriers.
The lockless radix tree lookups are a harder problem than this, and
the implementation didn't look promising. I have other problems to deal
with so I'm not going to go very far into this.
While I agree that locklessness is the right direction for the
pagecache to go, this RFC seems to have too far to go to use it to
conclude anything about the subject.
