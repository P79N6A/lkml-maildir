Subject: [Patch] shmmin behaviour back to 2.2 behaviour
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi Linus,
The following patchlet bring the handling of shmget with size zero
back to the 2.2 behaviour. There seem to be programs out, which
(erroneously) rely on this.
Greetings
                Christoph
