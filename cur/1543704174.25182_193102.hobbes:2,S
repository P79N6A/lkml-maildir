Subject: (driver model) bus kset list manipulation bug

Hi Patrick, I know you've passed maintainership of the driver model code 
on, but I was hoping I could jog your memory.
I've found a bug in drivers/base/bus.c, where the bus_type.devices.list 
is treated as a list of device structs. bus_type.devices is a kset 
though, so devices.list should contain kobjects rather than devices. 
Here is the diff I've come up with:

The first hunk you can see is symmetrical with to_drv just below. The 
next hunk, to bus_for_each_dev, makes it match up with bus_for_each_drv 
(I take this as evidence that I'm right). The next hunk, in 
driver_attach, can be compared with device_attach and again you'll see 
the symmetry (to_drv/to_dev).
The last hunk in bus_add_device is where we were inserting the 
device.bus_list rather than devices.kobject.entry into the kset.
These are the only 3 users of the devices kset that I could find. 
Unfortunately when I make these changes I get a panic like so:
    bus_match +0x28
    driver_attach +0xa0
    bus_add_driver +0xdc
    driver_register +0x38
    pci_register_driver +0x6c
    serial8250_pci_init +0x28
I'm having a bit of trouble figuring out what went wrong. Are there 
other users of bus_type.devices that I've missed and need updating? Thanks!
