Actually, if anyone else is experiencing problems shutting down, as there 
have been quite a few reports in the last few days (thanks to myself and 
the SCSI guys), could you please do the following: 
- Apply both the patches mentioned in this email:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=103522568629074&w=2
- Enable debugging in drivers/base/power.c at the top of the file by 
applying the patch below.
- Rebuild and try again. 
If you're still experiencing a hang or an Oops, please report it to me 
and/or the list, along with your .config. 
Thanks,
	-pat
