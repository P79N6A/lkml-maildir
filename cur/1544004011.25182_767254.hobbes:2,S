Some progress with (2.6.28-rc4 this time)...  I've booted with /bin/bash
as init: works.
Then I rebooted in single mode => works
Runlevel 3 => works
Runlevel 5 => doesn't work
In terms of devices, lsmod says the only differences between runlevel 3
and runlevel 5 are that both drm and radeon are loaded...
If I rmmod radeon and drm while X is running suspending the devices
works...  I guess I don't have DRI enabled???  Just looked at the logs,
I guess I don't [1]...
Looking at a git log -p of gpu/drm/radeon shows lots of difference
between 2.6.26 and HEAD...  I see a vblank change [2] that changes the
way the device is suspended, not sure if it really matters though...
Alex, Jesse and/or Dave can you think of anything before I bisect?  FYI
my radeon is a:
ATI Technologies Inc Radeon Mobility M7 LW [Radeon Mobility 7500] rev 0,
Cheers,
Mathieu
