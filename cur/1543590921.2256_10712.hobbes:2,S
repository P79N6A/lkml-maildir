> I installed the 2.4.4 kernel on a dual P3-733 system with 1 GB of ECC RAM and found that /proc/meminfo reports back only 899MB of RAM.  The 2.4.2 kernel (with RedHat patches from the 7.1 release) worked fine as did the 2.4.0 kernel (with RedHat patches from the 7.0 release).#
Built it with 4GB support. 1Gb actually works out at about 900Mb and possibly
wants renaming..
