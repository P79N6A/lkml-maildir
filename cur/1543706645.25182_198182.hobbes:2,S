Subject: [BUG] 2.4.24 Via audio driver.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Can anyone offer any possible debug tips for tracing a problem with the Via 
Audio driver under 2.4.24?
Before anyone asks, I already tried using the email address in the maintainers 
list (linux-via@gtf.org) - that address is invalid - no such user.
The problem is that the audio driver appears to not be initializing the DSP
correctly.  Thus, I get no audio out.
Here is the relevent lines from dmesg:
root@db:~# dmesg | grep -i via

via82cxxx: Six channel audio available
via82cxxx: timeout while reading AC97 codec (0x8000000)
via82cxxx: board #1 at 0xE000, IRQ 9
Note that I already have tried the following in via_ac97_wait_idle
(via82cxxx.c): changing the usleep value from 15 to 150 - no difference.
Here is the dump from lspci -vv
