As they are currently implemented, the markers use the sorted module
list for marker listing, but I can change their implementation so they
do not require this (and make it a subsequent patch instead).
I could do that to diminish the patchset size a little more. However, it
implies using an interface with a known race condition. Could we just
post this as two different patchsets instead ? I really think the sorted
module list would be important to get in and I don't like to use buggy
unfixed lower level functions.
