	Exactly. This is the UNIX tradition of static and dynamic priorities. The 
more polite you are about yielding the CPU when you don't need it, the more 
claim you have to getting it when you do need it.

	Not all, just the same share any other process gets. They're all 
ready-to-run, they're all at the same priority.

	Then tell us what you are doing so we can tell you the *right* way to do it. 
Unless this is just an abstract theoretical exercise, you shouldn't complain 
when ready-to-run threads get the CPU.
