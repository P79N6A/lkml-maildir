Well, in case anyone actually cares, here's a patch (at the end of the 
mail) to fix the nit. "x86" does seem to be in the majority compared to 
"X86" in the Kconfig help texts, I guess we might as well make it 
consistent..

Filesystems, yes. C source, yes. help text for kernel options, no.
Desc: [Documentation] Make Kconfig help texts use the term "x86" consistently.
