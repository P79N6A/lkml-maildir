Bugha-gha,  I like you :)
It _is_ the way to use GPL only work_queues and to put trojan horses.
You've cracked me.
Btw, do you know, that ioctl is the way to call "any priviliged
kernel-mode 'callback' to user code" too?
Actually one can implement it in it's binary only driver by itself, 
it just requres some netlink/skbuff knowledge.
Since binary-only modules do not implement the same low level protocol
twice(that's why they are binary _only_), it will not cost too much for
their authors.
And, last ironic note:
extern void (*private_binary_only_callback)(void *);
int day_of_the_hell = HZ;
module_param(day_of_the_hell, int, 0);
int bi()
{
  init_timer(&bt);
  bt.function = private_binary_only_callback;
  bt.expires = jiffies + day_of_the_hell;
  bt.data = NULL;
  add_timer(&bt);
}
void fi()
{
  del_timer_sync(&bt);
}
module_init(bi);
module_exit(fi);
or something...
Sigh, and noone abolished EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL();
