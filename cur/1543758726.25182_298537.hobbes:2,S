The BSD accounting tools will expect the data to be written in a certain 
format, so we can't change that.  We could, however, unify the data 
collection under CONFIG_ACCOUNTING or something, that collects all the data 
available (which would be the sum of the data collected by the BSD and CSA 
calls) and then throw away data when writing to the BSD log so its format 
remains the same.
That would simplify data collection since there would just be one set of 
calls, and data reporting could be driven by userspace (whether it's in 
old-style sys_acct format, or new-style data that CSA/ELSA defines).
