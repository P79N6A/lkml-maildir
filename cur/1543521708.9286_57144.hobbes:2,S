sorry for this Q
but since yesterday(monday) I have a delay receiving kernel mails, the
delay is about 5-6h, the latest mail I got was timed from 19:05
On monday I didn't receive any mails until late night. Was blocked from
early morning. 
Well it's not so a bad, I get them, but I'm kind unsure. 
Has anybody else experienced that?
Andreas
