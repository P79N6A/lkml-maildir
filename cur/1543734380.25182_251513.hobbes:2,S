It worked no worse than current version (which is broken). In fact the 2.4 
clone had 2 arguments. So it's obvious.
I checked in the i386 code (the _syscall5 macro and the sys_clone definition). 
And the patch from David is the correct one:
This says where args go (from unistd.h, macro _syscall5):
        : "0" (__NR_##name),"b" ((long)(arg1)),"c" ((long)(arg2)), \
          "d" ((long)(arg3)),"S" ((long)(arg4)),"D" ((long)(arg5))); \
And this is the i386 code, with some comments, especially about the three 
remaining problems:
asmlinkage int sys_clone(struct pt_regs regs)
{
        unsigned long clone_flags;
        unsigned long newsp;
        int __user *parent_tidptr, *child_tidptr;
        clone_flags = regs.ebx; //arg1
        newsp = regs.ecx; //arg2
        parent_tidptr = (int __user *)regs.edx; //arg3
        child_tidptr = (int __user *)regs.edi; //arg5
/*XXX: Shouldn't UML implement this?*/
        if (!newsp)
                newsp = regs.esp;
/*XXX: UML forgets the "& ~ CLONE_IDLETASK". */
/*And also UML does not pass regs.*/
        return do_fork(clone_flags & ~CLONE_IDLETASK, newsp, &regs, 0, 
parent_tidptr, child_tidptr);
}
Now, the CLONE_IDLETASK must be copied straight into our version. Pretty 
clear, that flag is for kernelspace callers of do_fork() only.
Security problem? I guess possibly (in the meaning used by OpenBSD, i.e. it is 
a security concern, because somehow could discover that this is exploitable).
Instead, luckily, both newsp and regs are passed unchanged to the arch code 
(the arch-independent code ignores them), and exactly to copy_thread. And the 
Uml version is ready to deal with this API, luckily.
However, this is non-standard. I've added just a comment for now, since you 
may have reason to keep the current code, but such behaviour calls for 
breakage when things change.
The attached patch replaces the one on your page.

* Make sys_clone subarch-dependant
* Since i386 sys_clone skips reading %edi, the third param is unused
* Also, avoid passing to do_fork the CLONE_IDLETASK flag.
* Add a comment about the special calling convention used by UML for
do_fork and copy_thread.
