Actually, I ran into this same bug a day or so ago when updating to  
2.6.13-rc6,
it's just I noticed the error, fixed my config, then recompiled and  
forgot
about it completely until now :-D.  Thanks for the bug report, though!
Cheers,

looked at
it in the right way, did not become still more complicated.
