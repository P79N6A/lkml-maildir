	I don't know what you mean by this.  It's not a question of
whether the behavior being accomodated is conformant or nonconformant
to a standard.  The question is whether the accomodations controlled
by the "STANDARD_ATAPI" macro can easily be implemented in sr_mod.
Since the accomodations are translating a couple of numbers that
are repeseneted as binary coded decimal instead of integers (0-255)
on some drives, and sending a slightly different SCSI command to
change discs on a Sanyo three CD changer, it seems that they can easily
be implemented in sr_mod.

	From you email address, I would guess that English is not your
first language.  While you do write English very well, I think you made
a mistake in understanding what I siad.  "It should be easy to
have sr_mod accomodate those drives" means that it would be easy for
someone to write code in the near future to do this (that is, to change
sr_mod.c).  It does not mean that it has already been done.
