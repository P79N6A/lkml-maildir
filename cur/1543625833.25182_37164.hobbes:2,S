Unfortunately, your method #3 conflicts with methods #0 through #2,
which exhaust the range of possible values that may be returned
in *start.  Any value greater than buffer is regarded as being
"within the buffer".
Introducing method #1 was a bad idea because this hack made it
impossible cleanly to implement what you suggest.
