So you think the uclibc users should be getting their headers from glibc then?
I don't.  I like this work, and intend to integrate it into some systems I'm 
putting together, after I get all the rest of the busybox bugs shaken out.  
(Well, not always bugs.  Lots of it's missing functionality.  I'm using 
busybox to replace coreutils, bzip2, findutils, grep, sed, tar, util-linux, 
and so on...  And then adding binutils and gcc and trying to compile software 
with the resultng system.  Yes, I am insane.  This is what's taking up all my 
spare hacking time these days...)
I'll replace glibc with uclibc (and the 2.4 headers with 2.6 headers) once 
I've finished with busybox.  (So far I've had to rewrite sed more or less 
from scratch, and revert to the non-busybox versions of sort, sh, awk, patch, 
ar, gzip, and gunzip.  But some of those are easy to fix, and the rest of 
busybox seems to be capable of being used as part of a development 
environment, even to the point of handling ./configure and make for the GNU 
tools they replace...)
