That is a reasonable approach.

That is also reasonable. None of the RDMA libraries I have worked on
bothered to use an atexit()-type hook because the user was theoretically
*required* to close the rnic, and driver code was already reuqired to clean
up in case of a total process failure. Adding an intermediate safety-net
for applications that exited cleanly but forget to close just didn't seem
worthwhile. If the application wants the cleanup performed optimally
then it can close the rnic, otherwise it can't complain about forcing
the RNIC vendor to clean up in the driver code.

That should be allowed. It is actually more normal to use the parent
as a dispatcher and to actually manage the connection in a child
process.
