Subject: [2.5.50] Keyboard dying
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

       After some X <-> back switches keyboard stops doing anything.
       2.5.50 + preempt enabled, X 4.2.1-debian-unstable.
showkey started using gpm tells that the keys actually are pressed and
processed by the kernel.
Although even alt+sysrq+whatever do not make any effect.
