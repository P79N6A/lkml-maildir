Agreed that is a bug.

Totally agreed.  I was explicitly initializing all of the fields
then I missed one in an update and got bit rather badly.  So I went
for the shotgun approach.  I should probably just make it kmalloc
again at this point.   I think kmalloc plus explicitly initializing
the fields is going to be a more readable and more efficient because
it removes the redundancy.
