This fixes only symptom, not illness.
This check represent what code think about filesystem layout.
On what actually kind of UFS system did you test this patch?
When I sometime ago fixed similar issue for openstep ufs,
actully this was darwin's ufs which has the same layout,
I just set s_dirblksize to right value, may be for 
UFS_MOUNT_UFSTYPE_NEXTSTEP, UFS_MOUNT_UFSTYPE_NEXTSTEP_CD you need
do the same, see TODO items in fs/ufs/super.c.

Your right; I was using the NextStep ufstype on an OpenStep HD.
I have now checked an old (pre NS 3.3) floppy and a NS 3.3 CDROM
and they both need a  s_dirblksize  of 1024, just as the OpenStep
filesystem does. For the floppies, one can just use the OpenStep
option, but for a NextStep CDROM, the right s_dirblksize is
crucial. I would suggest changing both.
Thanks for the response,
