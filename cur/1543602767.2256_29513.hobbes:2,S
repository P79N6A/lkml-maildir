I'm not entirely sure if this is ac15's fault or the preempt patch acting up. 
But this is very ide-scsi centric so i'm leaning towards ac15.  I burned a cd 
using my ide writer and it worked fine.  Then i went to burn another and the 
drive went into an infinite reset loop.  like this.
	SCSI bus is being reset for host 0 channel 0.
	scsi0 : channel 0 target 0 lun 0 request sense failed, performing reset.
reloading the modules does nothing but report this error. 
	SCSI subsystem driver Revision: 1.00
	scsi0 : SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices
	scsi0 : channel 0 target 0 lun 0 request sense failed, performing reset.
	SCSI bus is being reset for host 0 channel 0.
Even though the modules were removed, the drive led is still blinking like it 
was writing.  If anyone needs some more info i'll try and get it. 
the cdr did detect and work correctly at boot. 
hardware:
