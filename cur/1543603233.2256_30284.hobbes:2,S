Yes, semaphores and spinlocks are not recursive. There is one exception
for rw spinlocks, they can recurse on read. I'm not aware that there are
any plans to change that.
My patch avoids calling copy_from_user in elf_core_dump, Andrea adds a 
limited recursion support and uses that to prevent the deadlock.
With his patch you can recurse on on down_read() if you pass special
parameters.
But full recursion support is not planned.
