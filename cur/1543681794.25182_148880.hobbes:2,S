Huh? Look at it this way: As it is now, if you have a non-hotplug joystick, 
then you can't load anything automatically, not even the hardware drivers.
If you have demand-loading in the input layer, on the other hand, you can have 
"above" directives in modules.conf (or "install" directives in modprobe.conf) 
to pull in the hardware drivers along with joydev. So not only does 
demand-loading permit hardware drivers and userspace interfaces independently 
of each other, it also provides for loading hardware drivers on demand for 
non-hotplug hardware.
