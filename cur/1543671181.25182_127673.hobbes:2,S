They can't affect the license of Linux because COPYING included with the
kernel says:
 Also note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as the kernel
 is concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not
 v2.2 or v3.x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated.
Now, IIRC, that paragraph was added after the fact, so someone could go
back to a version before that paragraph and fork under a new version of
the GPL, however they could not take any code from the current versions
of the kernel.
About 20% of the files in the kernel include the "at your option" clause
(this is from looking at the source to RH's 2.4.20-8).
