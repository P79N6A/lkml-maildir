I've done it before when I wasn't thinking, since it parallels those,
modules_install just calls modules_install.  AFAIK, it doesn't depend on
modules actually being compiled.
Typically, I do:
make -j 20 dep;make -j 20 bzImage modules;make modules_install
Yes, I've heard about the paralleled dep problem (there was one, right?),
but it hasn't effected me.
