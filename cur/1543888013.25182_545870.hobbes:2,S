This is the original ARM dyntick stuff, right ?
The dyntick support on your architecture is broken. Why does it fiddle
with the timer, when the system is not idle ?
This stuff should go away ASAP. A lot of ARMs are already converted to
clock events are using the generic NOHZ implementation, which does not
have those problems at all.
