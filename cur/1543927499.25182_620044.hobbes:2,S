argh. Guess i misread your answer:

i took that "Nope" as referring to my impression - but you in fact meant 
that i am not wrong? :-) So nothing to see here. single-bzImage initrd 
was and is possible, so we could in fact move chunks of system-related 
userland (such as irqbalanced) into the kernel proper?
