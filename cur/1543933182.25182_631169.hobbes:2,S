And if you still don't get it, I'm saying that x86, in the syscall
trap return path, should set the conditon codes based upon whether the
system call is really signalling an error or not.
And to handle potentially ambiguous cases we, for a long time, have
the force_successful_syscall_return() arch hook.  System call
implementations use this when the return values they give could be
mis-construed as error values.
And if you'll notice x86 makes no attempt to implement that hook,
because it currently can't.  That's what needs to be fixed.
