The protocol is
	lock_page()
	set_page_writeback()
	->writepage()
and there are various places which assume that nobody will start new
writeout of a locked page.  But I forget where they are - things have always
been this way.
If NFS is running set_page_writeback() against an unlocked page then I
don't know what will break.  I didn't know it was doing that.
