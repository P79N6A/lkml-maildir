Which appears to be a crash in wake_up_process() when doing memory
reclaim (waking the xfsbufd).

Ok, I've found this pattern:
#define POISON_FREE 0x6b
Can you confirm that you are running with CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB=y?
If so, we have a use after free occurring here and it would also
explain why no-one has reported it before.
FWIW, can you turn on CONFIG_XFS_DEBUG=y and see if that triggers
a different bug check prior to the above dump?
Cheers,
Dave.
