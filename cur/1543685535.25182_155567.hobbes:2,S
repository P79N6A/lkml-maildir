Didn't fix my problem.  I'll dig in and narrow this down further.

Interesting.  Something these have in common is that they all use
Berkeley db4 (up2date by virtue of using rpm).  I don't understand why
nss_ldap or pam_ldap would, but it's one of the sources in the srpm.
But, rpm works for me (both RH and unpatched kernels).
