Release 2.1.3: Tue Jan 15 14:41:45 EST 2002
	* Resync with 2.4.18-pre3 and 2.5.2.
	* It is now possible to declare explicit saveability predicates.
	* The `vitality' flag is gone from the language.  Instead, the 
	  autoprober detects the type of your root filesystem and forces
	  its symbol to Y.
The interactive configurators remain stable; no bugs of any kind have been 
reported since 6 Jan.  I'm waiting on an update of the probe tables from
Giacomo Catenazzi before releasing 2.2.0.

Under democracy one party always devotes its chief energies
to trying to prove that the other party is unfit to rule--and
both commonly succeed, and are right... The United States
has never developed an aristocracy really disinterested or an
intelligentsia really intelligent. Its history is simply a record
of vacillations between two gangs of frauds.
