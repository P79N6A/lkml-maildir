please check if this is a duplicate of bug #11259.

We (Wu, fengguang and me) reproduced this bug on a HP 6910p.
and we found that windows run a different AML code path when closing Lid
on this laptop and the SMI is not invoked...
And I have verified how to make Linux run the same code path by changing
the IGD OpRegion code.
DIDL is an IGD OpRegion field, as the Supported Display Devices ID List.
﻿it's evaluated by the _DOD method when ACPI video driver is loaded.
And according to the spec, "The graphics driver writes to this field
once during its initialization"
if DIDL is not empty, a flag is set and the SMI will not be invoked when
closing the lid.
In our tests, this field (DIDL) is set in windows when _DOD is invoked
while it's not in Linux.
I can workaround this bug by setting the DIDL manually in AML code.
So a patch setting the DIDL in i915_opregion.c should be a proper fix
for this problem. Fengguang will cook up a patch later.
But there is still one mystery left.
Windows doesn't break even if the SMI is invoked...
thanks,
rui
