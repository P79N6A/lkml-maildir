Hi Joerg:
(I tried to follow-up using the gmane.org mail/news gateway... didn't seem
to work.)

Please run the following commands as root (against both kernel versions) and
reply-to-all with the results:
	# modprobe i2c-dev
	# i2cdump -y 0 0x2d b 0 0x4e
	# i2cdump -y 0 0x48
	# i2cdump -y 0 0x49
Also, can you confirm that you're using the sensors.conf from here:
http://www.tyan.com/support_download_utility.aspx?model=s.s2466
Finally, can you confirm that "sensors -s" is running (without error) some
time during system startup, w/ both kernel versions?
Thanks & regards,
