Hello,
My machine (an ASUS P5W-DH-Deluxe, Core2, 4Go RAM, 3 SATA and 2IDE) is
reporting a :
irq 23: nobody cared (try booting with the "irqpoll" option)
together with a Call Trace, but :
 - irqpoll is present on the command line,
 - the irq is reported to be used by libata,
 - the irqpoll option is mandatory if I want _some_ of my SATA disks to be 
   accessible.
I've attached a file with :
 - dmesg, 
 - cat /proc/interrupts
 - lspci
 - lspci -vvv
 - my .config
I've tried mounting and accessing all the disks, and it works.
The last weird thing : though reported as used by libata, the irq 23 counter
seems to be fixed at 200001, though I've mounted and accessed all the
disks !
