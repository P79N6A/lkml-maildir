Any difference which is transparent to software is irrelevant.  Hardware 
differences which can be dealt with and hidden by the kernel are things 
Linux can just deal with.  The only thing that really matters here is 
user space.
People don't seem to have problems compiling kernels for specific 
processors, and the kernel can be designed to also do run-time detection 
for the generic case (i.e. boot CD's, etc.).
