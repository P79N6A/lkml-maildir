hi
I keep getting the exact same error
EXT3-fs error (device ide2(33,0)): ext3_new_block: Allocating block in system zone - block = 884763
EXT3-fs error (device ide2(33,0)): ext3_new_block: Allocating block in system zone - block = 884764
EXT3-fs error (device ide2(33,0)): ext3_new_block: Allocating block in system zone - block = 884765
EXT3-fs error (device ide2(33,0)): ext3_new_block: Allocating block in system zone - block = 884766
EXT3-fs error (device ide2(33,0)): ext3_new_block: Allocating block in system zone - block = 884767
...
The fs is newly created, and the computer has been working fine all the time.
Anyone know what this is ?
I'm running 2.4.17-tux-ide-rmap11c
