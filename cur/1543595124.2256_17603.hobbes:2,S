If your interested in old magazines, I had saved literally dozens of 80's
computer magazines, Compute, Computes Gazette, and some others.  I just
cleaned up the house, but may have some left.  I didn't think anyone was
interested in this stuff, and threw a bunch away.  I would be happy to
donate them if I have some left.  Let me know offline, as this sounds like
an interesting project.
