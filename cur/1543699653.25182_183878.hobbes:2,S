No you don't.  In fact, that would defeat one of the purposes of
usb_reset_device, which is to re-initialize the device while leaving an 
existing driver bound to it (so far as I know that feature is only used by 
usb-storage).  It's a last-ditch form of error recovery.
The API has an admitted weak spot when more than one driver is bound to 
the device.  No one has settled on a definite policy for how to handle 
that situation.

In the success case there are no errors, the device hasn't morphed, and 
there's no need to do anything in another thread.  The existing driver(s) 
can remain bound, usb_reset_device returns 0, and nothing more has to be 
done.
