So it is so stable that it isn't even merged into the mainline 2.4.x
sources? :-)
We're talking about a port which doesn't even exist in the mainline
sources yet.

No, I'm saying that ppc64 with >=256 physical PCI busses, is 2.5.x
material.

Yes, no kludges for 2.4.x
Look, I do not even feel for you.
I waited patiently for a sane PCI dma architecture so I could support
>4GB ram on 64-bit PCI systems (sparc64, alpha, etc.).  And it was
worth the wait, most of the important PCI drivers fully use this
interface, and it was all done properly.
Similarly you can wait for 2.5.x for >=256 physical PCI bus support.
Ok?
