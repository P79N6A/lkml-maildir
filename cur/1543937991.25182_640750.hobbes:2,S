Hi,
I have a PCI video capture card, and the command `lspci` tell me the
following info:
     00:09.0 Multimedia controller: Philips Semiconductors SAA7146 (rev 01)
In the kernel source, I compiled the module saa7146.ko and saa7146_vv.ko.
Those modules were inserted into kernel successfully.
But I can't find any new device file in /dev.
Can you tell me the reason?
Does the saa1746 module plays as a common driver for all the device
with that chip?
Thanks!
