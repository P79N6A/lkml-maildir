Potential bugs notwithstanding, given that this is a STREAM socket, and 
as such shouldn't (I hope, or I'm eating toes for dinner again) have 
side effects like tossing the rest of a datagram, why are you using 
MSG_PEEK?  Why not simply read the N bytes of the message that will have 
the message length with a normal read/recv, and then read that many 
bytes in the next call?
