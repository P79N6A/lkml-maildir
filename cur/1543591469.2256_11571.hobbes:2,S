Subject: FIC AD11(AMD 761/VIA 686B) AGP port not supported

The Motherboard is a FIC AD11(AMD 761/VIA 686B chipset).  Vid-card is a radeon 32M ddr model.
Whenever I startx with the radeon driver, the machine hangs, forced to use reset switch, not even C-A-Del works.  But with the generic vga driver I get all of 16 colors at less than 640x480.
Here are relevant dmesg lines:
agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 94M
agpgart: Unsupported AMD chipset (device id: 700e), you might want to try agp_try_unsupported=1.
agpgart: no supported devices found.
What does agp_try_unsupported mean?  Where do I set this setting?
and relevant lspci:
00:00.0 Host bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD]: Unknown device 700e (rev 12)

Also attached are the full dmesg and lspci output.
Please help, as it is I am force to use windows to get anything done (that too needed updated drivers before it would work properly).
Thanks in advance -- Josh
