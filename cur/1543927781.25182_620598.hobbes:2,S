With this patch I am seeing a endless stream of  IN_IGNORED events
for a removed watch.  I don't see a reason that user space should
ever see any IN_IGNORED, but an endless steam is not good.
Utterly unrelated, inotify does not work in /proc/.  The list archives
suggest that it isn't likely to start working anytime soon, but shouldn't
inotify_add_watch when fail with ENOSYS instead of pretending
it worked?
