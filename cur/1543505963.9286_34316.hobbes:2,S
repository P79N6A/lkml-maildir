	Folks, the first variant of FAT patch made it into 2.3.13. Please,
help testing it.
	Known b0rkenness:
a) devices with large sectors. Not yet.
b) dmsdos.
c) races around the truncate() - waits for the generic_write_file() /
sys_truncate() / knfsd serialization stuff.
	It's still not safe. It kinda-sorta works on devices with 512-byte
sectors, but it may eat your filesystem. Treat with care. Bug reports are
more than welcome, but if some luser will go "oh, FAT finally compiles, let's
try it on our critical data" he will get no condolence from me. You've been
warned. It's an improvement over the previous state (completely broken),
but it's still alpha-quality stuff.
