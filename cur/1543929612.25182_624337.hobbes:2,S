Doesn't do erase?  MTD has to learn almost all tricks from the block
layer, as devices are becoming high-latency high-bandwidth, compared to
what MTD was designed for.  In order to get any decent performance, we
need asynchronous operations, request queues and caching.
The only useful advantage MTD does have over block devices is an
_explicit_ erase operation.  Did you mean "doesn't do _implicit_ erase".
