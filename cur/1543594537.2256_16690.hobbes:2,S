Hi all,
I started running 2.4.6-pre3 using the same configuration file as 2.4.5.
Diff shows no effective differences between two config files.
depmod complains unresolved symbols (do_softirq) in ppp_generic, ppp_async
and sunrpc.
do_softirq is listed in System.map-2.4.6-pre3.
I started with a new source tree and built the kernel with Debian kernel
package.
Any comment? Thanks in advance.
Regards,
Anuradha
