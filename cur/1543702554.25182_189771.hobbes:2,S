I'm having trouble with e1000 in -mm1. (works in 2.6.1) The device is detected
and shows up and can be configured, but nothing ever goes out on the wire. 
Here is the device info:
07:01.1 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation: Unknown device 1010 (rev 01)
        Subsystem: Intel Corporation: Unknown device 1011
        Flags: bus master, 66Mhz, medium devsel, latency 64, IRQ 49
        Memory at fe9e0000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=128K]
        I/O ports at dc00 [size=64]
        Capabilities: [dc] Power Management version 2
        Capabilities: [e4] PCI-X non-bridge device.
        Capabilities: [f0] Message Signalled Interrupts: 64bit+ Queue=0/0

tcpdump shows no activity when I attempt to use the e1000 interface.
