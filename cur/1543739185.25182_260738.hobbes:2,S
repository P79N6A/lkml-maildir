I suppose this is a matter of taste.  I find it much clearer this way,
to overloading 0 vs 1 returns.

Not really: I've never had a single bug report, and I've had a fair
number of bug reports.  Without signed modules, it's really 300 lines of
code for no actual gain.  OTOH, it's going to be in the tree anyway. 
Unless we want to "sign" modules with a straight checksum when
!CONFIG_MODULE_SIG?  I'm not really convinced it's worth it.  Thoughts
welcome.

Sorry, my bad.
Now we have the code in front of us, I'll ask you to answer honestly. 
Do *you* think that the extra ~600 lines of code is a worthwhile
tradeoff so we can simply strip modules without resigning?  You know my
opinion, but you've done the code, and if you're really convinced of
that, I'll ack it.
(I'm not sure that having a whole GPG format parser in the kernel
matches our minimalistic ideals either, but I can see a much stronger
incentive there: less risk of weakening the signatures, convenience, and
the signing infrastructure can be used for other things).
Cheers,
Rusty.
