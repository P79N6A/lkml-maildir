...so one would think...yes it is supported technically, and the atp870u
driver does exist...but the 2.4 one does not work, that is a known fact.
browsing the forums, it seems that people were complaining about
 >2037 not working, but that the original one worked just fine.
some of the code has a different format in 2.4 than 2.2 and 2.0,
mostly the external stuff to load as modules...etc, but i can't get it 
to work.
so i needed help porting the old one into the new 2.4 framework
if you will.
