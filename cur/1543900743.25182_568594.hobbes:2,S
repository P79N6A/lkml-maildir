Hm, odd.  Ok, I see how it went.
I tested it _before_ that change went in with make oldconfig, and then
later after that patch went in.  If you do that (running oldconfig
between the patches) you do not get asked the zillion different USB
questions.  If, however, you just start with all of the patches at once,
it becomes annoying as hell.
So sorry about this fix, I agree with the revert, and am going to have
to try to figure out some way to check for things like this in the
future (rolling back .config files to the last version or something...)
thanks,
