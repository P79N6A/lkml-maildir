I have heard a lot of complaints from embedded people about having few
choices for graphics chips. Many of the low end chips from ATI/NVidia
are no longer in production and you are forced into buying more chip
than you want. You should ask about this on embedded developer lists.
For the new X servers you have to have hardware alpha blending.
Another important feature is accelerated drawing to off-screen
buffers. Also, DMA command queues help a lot with parallelizing
drawing.
If you implement VGA you will be able to boot and work in any x86
system without writing any code other than the BIOS.
