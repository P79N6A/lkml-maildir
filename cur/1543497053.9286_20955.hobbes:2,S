   On short cable, for notebook-to-notebook data transfer, it seems very
   practical to me. [serial cables are much more common than 10mbit
   pcmcia cards.] 
It depends on your environment, I suspect; in the circles which I
frequent, ethernet cables and pcmcia cards are far more commonly carried
around in one's laptop bags than serial cables.

   Is there some easy way for me to make it work 'just now'? Like calling
   tty_flip_buffer_push from some kind of bh or increasing hz to 1000 or
   ...? 
Well, you could set tty->low_latency and then call
tty_flip_buffer_push(), which will force it out to the line discpline
right away.  Increasaing HZ to 1000 is also a possibility.
   Why is size of struct tty limited to PAGE_SIZE in the first place?
Struct tty was done in the days where we didn't have wonderfully
efficient allocators.  So struct tty is allocated using get_free_page().
Back then I was also trying to make sure the driver was reasonably
memory efficient, so that's why the flip buffer is stored a part of
struct tty instead of being a separately allocated piece of dynamic
memory.   
If I were to change things now, I would not make struct tty bigger than
PAGE_SIZE; even now, it's best if you avoid trying to allocate objects
bigger than a page if you can help it.  Instead, I'd make the flip
buffer allocated separately from the tty structure, and make it up to
the device driver what a proper size for the flip buffer ought to be.
That way we don't have to waste a lot of memory if a device *knows* that
it's only doing low-speed transfers that don't need a lot of flip buffer
space.
