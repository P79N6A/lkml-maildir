Hello,
Just joined the list, and whipped throuh the FAQ. Then the MAINTAINERS
list. Can't really find a better place to ask this question. I admit I
am not in your league and will mostly lurk and attempt to learn through
osmosis if necessary.
All of the 2.3 kernels I have attempted to compile fail at init/main.c
because it is missing a declaration for memory_start. I tried inserting
the definition from the 2.2.13 version of init/main.c:
extern unsigned long memory_start = 0;
Since it's so obvious, and has survived so many 2.3.x kernel releases, I
have pondered wether it is a test to prevent people like me from trying
the 2.3.x kernels or if perhaps I am missing the point and doing
something else wrong. I have updated all the necessary files for running
a 2.3.x system according to the list I found at www.kernelnotes.org.
In any event replacing the line will allow the kernel to compile, but it
fails to start. It decompresses and dies. Not one line of output. My
machine is a K6 3/450 on an FIC-2013 MoBo, latest Bios. About the same
thing happens on my 533 Mhz Alpha 164SX MoBo. Not important in the long
run, eventually it will be made to work (thank you all).
