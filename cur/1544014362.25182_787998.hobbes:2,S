Currently, the Linux kernel keeps time in UTC. This means
that it must take special actions to tick twice when a leap
second comes by.  Due to a (stupid) bug, some fraction
of linux systems crashed; this includes everything from
laptops to servers, to DVR's,  to cell phones and cell
phone towers. There's now a fix for this.
However, during the discussion, the idea came out that
maybe keeping UTC time in the kernel is just plain stupid.
So there's this idea floating around that maybe the kernel
should keep TAI time instead. The hope is that this will
reduce the complexity in the kernel, and push it out to
user space, "where it belongs" (to repeat a well-worn
mantra).
However, *if* we were to kick UTC out of the kernel,
and push it to user-land, then, of course, there's a
different problem: how does the kernel know what the
correct TAI time is?  As your reply makes abundantly
clear, NTP is not a good source for TAI information.
The comments which you labelled as "non-sense" were
a mis-understanding of  a discussion of a particular issue
that would arise if the kernel were to keep TAI -- if it did,
then user-space systems would need to have a reliable
source for leap-seconds. Since NTP does not
provide this, there was discussion about how that
could be worked-around. This then lead to the comment
that, "gee, wouldn't the right long-term solution be that
NTP provide TAI info?"
Clearly, it would be a lot of work to get the kernel to keep
TAI instead of UTC, so this is not, at this time, a "serious
proposal".  But if it were possible, and all the various
little issues that result were solvable, then it does seem
like a better long-term solution.
