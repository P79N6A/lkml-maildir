Sure.  Of course, you could just cast the return value to a long
inside ia64, but that's pretty unclear.
Hmm, I actually just tried to do this, and like all typedefs, it's
icky.  search_exception_table() belongs in kernel.h, not module.h
where it is now.  But that means kernel.h has to include asm/uaccess.h
to get exception_fixup_t.
Maybe the cleanest way really is to simply document that your
search_extable() returns the fixup word... 8(
