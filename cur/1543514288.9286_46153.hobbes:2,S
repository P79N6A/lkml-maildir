OK, I got that to work. I am interested in using this as a secure method to
access my firewall from another machine. How do I disallow logins via the
network, but allow them via the local (at the kbd) and remote (via serial
cable) only?
Also, will having a getty running on the serial port block the sending of oops
messages via the serial port ?
