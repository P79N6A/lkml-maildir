Cool!!!
As a start, I was palnning to ask such a question on LKML for a long time, but
somehow I always forget. Also running SETI@Home on a few Gentoo boxen, but with
stock kernels (now 2.6.7). Now that I started reading the first e-mail I thought
something like "Oh, so I _did_ send that mail?!?" :-)
I think I will check the suggested MIN_TIMESLICE thing on next recompile, but
it started me thinking...
Will it be very difficult to have /proc/sched/min_timeslice or something, instead of
the above compile-time define?
That will be really good thing for the our cases and souldn't (or am I overseeing
something) pose problems for "normal" usage. RFE!
BTW, the mentioned "sched batch kernel modification" is something else, right?
Google wasn't very usefull for "sched batch"...
Can you post any concrete pointers/patches for the sched batch modification?
Kalin.
