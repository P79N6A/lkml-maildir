I hadn't.  It's quite spookily similar in some ways.  There's a lot of
things you've added because you presumably have use for them in git that
could easily be added once we had users for them in the kernel.  There's
a few things stringbufs do that strbufs don't need to because they're in
userspace.
I can easily change the API at this point, so if renaming things will
make you happier, just say so.

It's a matter of taste ... some people prefer to use accessors for
everything, other people prefer to expose the underlying structure
directly.  I have to confess to being influenced by Java in 1998-99,
so possibly I tend to go for accessors too often.  Or possibly it's
just my experience of restructuring things in Linux where diffs would
be smaller if we only had used accessors for something.  In any case,
I don't care to fight about this; if you want it to be called buf,
then buf it shall be called, and I'll get rid of sb_string.
