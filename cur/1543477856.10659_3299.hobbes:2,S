I think this is just evil, and should never be allowed. 
This code is just an excuse to let other bugs abound. If we use d_move(),
we should have made certain that both parents were locked. If that part of
your patch fixes anything, something else is wrong. 
That part of your patch just hides potential real bugs, and as such is
completely unacceptable.
