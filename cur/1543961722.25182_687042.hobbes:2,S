Hi all,
Changes since next-20080429:
New tree: pci (has a "current" and "next" part).
There was a build break in Linus' tree (pasemic_edac - patch supplied and
applied). Also a build breakage in the v4l/dvb code - but this seems to
have been caused by not cleaning my tree before the build.
Conflicts continue to disappear due to code being merged upstream.  Also
several minor/whitespace conflicts have turned up due to merging slightly
different versions of patches than what is in the linux-next tree.
[Notably a conflict in the v4l-dvb merge that was really just git being
confused and thinking that a new file in one branch of the merge was a
rename of a file in the other branch when it really wasn't.  Both files
were mostly the GPL stuff.]
The nfsd tree merge duplication of code has gone.
The sched-latest tree section mismatch errors have gone.
The novfs and the go7007 driver build problems have gone.
I am carrying one less PNP fixup patches.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have created today's linux-next tree at
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sfr/linux-next.git
(tar balls at
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/sfr/linux-next/
).
You can see which trees have been included by looking in the Next/Trees
file in the source.  There are also quilt-import.log and merge.log files
in the Next directory.  Between each merge, the tree was built with
a ppc64_defconfig for powerpc and an allmodconfig for x86_64. After the
final fixups, it is also built with powerpc allnoconfig,
44x/ebony_defconfig and allyesconfig.
Below is a summary of the state of the merge.
We are up to 66 trees (counting Linus' and 9 trees of patches pending for
Linus' tree (which are mostly empty)), more are welcome (even if they are
currently empty).  Thanks to those who have contributed, and to those who
haven't, please do.
Status of my local build tests will be at
http://kisskb.ellerman.id.au/linux-next
 .  If maintainers want to give
advice about cross compilers/configs that work, we are always open to add
more builds.
Thanks to Jan Dittmer for adding the linux-next tree to his build tests
at 
http://l4x.org/k/
 , the guys at 
http://test.kernel.org/
 and Randy
Dunlap for doing many randconfig builds.
