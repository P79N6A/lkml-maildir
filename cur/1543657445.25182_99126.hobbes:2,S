Good day!
I'd like to present 2nd version of fastps.
Changes at kernel side:
  - common codebase for 2.4 and 2.5
  - filters incorporated (ability to select processes to be retreived)
  - possible deadlock removed
  - usage of for_each_task() reduced
  - O(1)-compatibility
Changes in userspace tool fps:
  - ability to select processes to be shown (see fps -h)
  - cleanups in output format
  - fps looks for System.map in several dirs
Patches against 2.4.20/2.5.53 and userspace tool may be found at
http://tmi.comex.ru/fps/
with best regards, Alex
