Yes, I have considered it.
Bugzilla sucks when it comes to tracking things. There is
a regression field, but there are no difference between
2.6.22 and 2.6.23 regression.
Most people are reporting bugs through LKML:
- 23 regressions with reference to LKML
- 4 regressions with reference to Bugzilla

Unfortunately, the world is not perfect.
Is anyone interested in maintaining KR list for stable releases?
