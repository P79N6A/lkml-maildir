Main reason: long long generates crap code on 32 bit architectures,
you are better off doing it by hand if it is in any way near
performance critical code. Also on 32 bit archs you can often get away
with just setting the upper 32 bits to zero and leaving them like
that.
I am curious, what sorta device requires 64 bit entities on a 32 bit
architecture?
