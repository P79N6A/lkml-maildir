I want to imagine there is some reason why some threading apps will have
issues?  I have since rc1-mm4 issues with evolution - some threads do
not seem to come out of sleep or get running time for some reason.
Unfortunately I cannot find the thread again.  Is there a patch I can
apply/revert to get it to work for now?
Thanks,
