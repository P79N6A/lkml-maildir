'Info make' would give you the answer :) But here's the relevant part:
     The targets which `.PRECIOUS' depends on are given the following
     special treatment: if `make' is killed or interrupted during the
     execution of their commands, the target is not deleted. Also, if
     the target is an intermediate file, it will not be deleted after
     it is no longer needed, as is normally done.
     You can also list the target pattern of an implicit rule (such as
     `%.o') as a dependency file of the special target `.PRECIOUS' to
     preserve intermediate files created by rules whose target
     patterns match that file's name.
So a) it seems to be just what you need and b) *is* documented. That
is, if you regard texinfo as documentation, but gcc is no better :)
