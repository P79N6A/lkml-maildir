[description of problem and solution snipped]
Ok, thanks for explaining.
To make a long story short, I don't need Linux 2.0.xx anymore (as of a
little over a week ago), so the existence of this bug doesn't really bother
me. I just wanted to report it anyway in case it was a sign of a larger bug
in the kernel or something. (In case it's not obvious, that means I won't
be making any effort to fix it - someone else who is still using 2.0.xx can
fix it if he/she wants.)
