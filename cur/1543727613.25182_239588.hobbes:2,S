Hmm, ok.

Ouch.  I wanted to avoid that, but if we can't, we can't.  Will
netpoll_set_trap then to an atomic_inc or an atomic_add?  I've only seen it
called with 1 and 0, is that all that was intended?

Well, we kept the second part of the patch, which deals with the
hard_start_xmit routine returning 1.  That was a valid bug, I believe.

Yah, and I just noticed we don't want the poll_lock to be per struct
netpoll.  It should be a static lock in the netpoll.c file.  The problem is
that more than one netpoll object can reference the same ethernet device.
Thanks,
