Will change.

It's supposed to be used by the code that registers the platform device
(see the example in the documentation). No in-tree users since the board
I'm using is not supported by the kernel.
I just had a better look at i2c-gpio and noticed that I missed
gpio_request()/gpio_free() calls from the driver. Also the open-drain
requirement could be removed like i2c-gpio does. I'll send a new patch
ASAP.
