Well pipes are just an example. It could be any type of communication.
What's more, even the synchronous wakeup uses the wake balancing path
(although that could be modified to only do wake balancing for synch
wakeups, I'd have to be convinced we should special case pipes and not
eg. semaphores or AF_UNIX sockets).

OK there are probably a number of things we can explore depending on
what are the symptoms (eg. excessive idle time, bad cache performance).
Unfortunately it is kind of difficult to tune 2.6.13 on the basis of
2.6.12 results - although that's not to say it won't indicate a good
avenue to investigate.
