It works!  I'm testing a machine that has everything integrated (blech) that
has this nic.  Works great, just one problem.  Since this is an NFS machine
I need to know the HW address.  This driver doesn't print even finding the
card when the system is looking for cards.  I'm sure it's not a big deal and
I don't require it (I had the hwaddr already written down).  By the time
this is added, I doubt that I'll have the machine by then so take your time
and concentrate on the more important things!
