	This is not the case, I don't know where you got this
idea. This is a *two* step process with a 6 month interval between the
two steps. This was clearly detailed earlier in this thread.

	Yes, this is precisely what we have been doing, the two APIs
have been working at the same time for more than 6 months.

	Yes, we had more of 6 months of the new API. Please check the
facts : included April 11th in Gentoo.

	Yes, maybe 6 months was two short. That's why I say that we
should give it one or two more months. Maybe we need FC6 to be
released.
