I haven't disappeared, between family and workday I compiled
and booted some earlier kernels. Final result: kernels down to
2.6.11-bk7 do not work, 2.6.11-bk6 and -bk5 work.
All the -bk7+ kernels I tried produced the same strange bug
on my system: after gpm started I was able to move the
pointer on the screen but when X started up, it's pointer froze.
Please, forget what I said about -mmX kernels, I remember
that I updated the multiconsole patch to certain kernel versions
and I tested them for clean compilation but I may not have
actually booted them.
Another difference between 2.6.11-bk5/6 and -bk7+:
Kudzu complains about a missing PS/2 keyboard and indeed,
the kernel does not recognize the keyboard on the AUX port
on -bk5/6, -bk7 and later recognize it again.
