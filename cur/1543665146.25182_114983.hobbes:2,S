It would be nice if we had a "batch-job-able" simulation of this situation,
to do more accurate testing with ... can anyone think of an easy way to
do such a thing? "waggle a few windows around on X and see if it feels 
better to you or not" is kind of hard to do accurate testing with.
Of course, the simulation has to be accurate too, or it gets stupid ;-)
