Ok, I'm getting much further on ppc64 thanks to Anton B.
So far, I need patched in the hvc console fix, Anton's SCSI fix for
2.6.14-rc1, Paulus's EEH fix, and I reverted
remove-near-all-bugs-in-mm-mempolicyc.patch and
convert-mempolicies-to-nodemask_t.patch
I got most of the way through the boot scripts and crashed while
bringing up the loopback interface.
Here's the latest PPC64 crash on 2.6.13-mm3:
smp_call_function on cpu 5: other cpus not responding (5)
cpu 0x5: Vector: 0  at [c00000000f3b6b00]
    pc: 000000000000003d
    lr: 000000000000003d
    sp: c00000000f3b6a90
   msr: 8000000000009032
  current = 0xc000000002018050
  paca    = 0xc00000000048a400
    pid   = 1679, comm = ip
enter ? for help
5:mon> t
(xmon hangs here)
Anyone have ideas on what to try?
