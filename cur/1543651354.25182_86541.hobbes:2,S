1st try (running as root from commandline): success
2nd try  (running as user, cdrecord invoked from gtoaster):
  SCSI host 0 abort ..  timed out - resetting
  aborting command due to timeout .. test unit ready .. 00 00 00 00 00 
  aborting command due to timeout .. prevent/allow medium removal 00
  00 00 01 00
after a reboot, I get the same problems (1st try success, 2nd try
fail, now with with messages from the IDE layer about DMA and "DRQ not
asserted yet"). Interesting observations: that I forgot to mention the
first e-mail:
* it seems to go wrong happen mostly the 2nd try, I can't recall
  failing on the first try after bootup,
* when the kernel goes into this reset loop, everything is hanging,
  e.g. when pressing num-lock from console it takes a few seconds
  before the indicator led changes
