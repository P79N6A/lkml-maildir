Subject: [PATCH] preserve correct battery state through suspend/resume cycles
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

There is a problem in th following scenario(s):
boot -> suspend -> (un)plug battery -> resume
The problem arises in both cases - i.e. suspend with battery plugged in, 
and resume with battery unplugged, or vice versa.
After resume, when the battery status has changed (plugged in -> unplegged 
or unplugged -> plugged in) during the time when the system was sleeping, 
the /proc/acpi/battery/*/* is wrong (showing the state before suspend, not 
the current state).
The following patch adds ->resume method to the ACPI battery handler, which
has the only aim - to check whether the battery state has changed during sleep, 
and if so, update the ACPI internal data structures, so that information 
published through /proc/acpi/battery/*/* is correct even after suspend/resume
cycle, during which the battery was removed/inserted.
The patch is against current ACPI git tree, but applies cleanly also 
against -mm and probably other trees. Please apply.
