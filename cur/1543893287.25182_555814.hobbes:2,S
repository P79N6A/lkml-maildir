That's a ridiculous statement. Non-native language abilities and
technical competence have very little to do with each other. People have
to understand the code and figure out what it is that they want to
change. As long as this is done cleanly and the intent is obvious,
language doesn't even factor in beyond the Signed-off-by tag. Explanation
is necessary from time to time, but it really depends on the area in
which someone is working. If it's a complicated and involved change, then
of course it takes a bit more effort on both sides, but that doesn't
invalidate the importance or necessity of the work.

It's arguable whether those that know English well derive any benefit
from semi-obsolete Documentation/* files either. One could speculate that
not being able to read semi-obsolete documentation and being forced to
read the code is actually more productive ;-)
Besides, Kconfig localization is more for the end users than the
developers anyways. I certainly don't see any problem with this, the more
people eyeballing the documentation, the easier it is to find out areas
where we're lacking or that are simply wrong.

I suggest you step outside of your box and spend more time working with
people who speak little to none of the languages you understand.
