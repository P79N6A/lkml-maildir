OK, this bit is just specific to your setup, right?

So this is a bug in modutils? Could you please talk to Keith and check
this out? I don't want to add hacks to the sample config file to work
around bugs elsewhere.

But devfsd does the initial scanning in the parent process. It's not
done in the child process. Even the comments describe this. Maybe your
boot scripts start devfsd with a "daemon" programme, which itself does
a fork-and-exec?
I'm pretty sure that devfsd does the right thing (it didn't
originally, and then I fixed it because my system broke).
BTW: please keep sending devfs reports directly to me and not the
list. I don't always see everything on the list...
