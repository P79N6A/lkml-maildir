I cannot locate any such guarantee in the NFS spec... are you refering to
another spec which applies?

I don't believe that the behavior in this case is deterministic.  If you
have multiple people accessing a single file, reading and writing to it,
there is no guarantee as to what the behavior is.  The client should be
able to handle any errors it creates for itself while doing this kind of
parallel operation.
