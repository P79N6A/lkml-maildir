Just to another-confirm the problem, I have this too. The sysrq-t shows only
swapper with trace showing some lock function called, I have a screenshot of
this, but not here and I can't post it (not even test anything) till Thursday,

I think, the screenshot was taken in shutdown process of 2.6.19-rc2-mm1.
