So, we (Greg and I) have talked about this before - I do have a tree,
but I normally send things to Greg rather than directly to you.  I should
probably change that (why add levels of indirection...), but for the
immediate purpose of getting this patch tested etc just go ahead and take
it in and when I get my act together I will put it in my tree.
