If I understand your problem, you wish to treat an archive file as if it 
was a directory.  Thus, in the ideal situation, you could do the following:
	cat hello.zip/hello.c
	gcc hello.zip/hello.c -o hello
	etc..
Rather than complicate matters with a second tree, use FUSE with an 
explicit directory.  For example, ~/expand could be your shadow, thus to 
compile hello.c from ~/hello.zip:
	gcc ~/expand/hello.zip^/hello.c -o hello
I think no kernel change would be required.
I'm not keen on the caret.  One of the early claims made in 
http://lwn.net/Articles/100148/
 is:

The claim is wrong.  UNIX systems have traditionally allowed the 
superuser to create hard links to directories.  See link(2) for 2.10BSD 
<

+BSD>.  
Having got that wrong throws doubt on the argument; perhaps a path can 
simultaneously be a file and a directory.
