Parsing a certificate into precisely the format needed by cryptoapi
will be a task for user-space.  At least that was our plan.  Cryptoapi
can check for validity and return -EINVAL if there's a problem, but
shouldn't have to do any complicated parsing.

where
	sign = private_encrypt (setkey(privkey); encrypt();)
	verify = public_decrypt (setkey(pubkey); decrypt();)
	encrypt = public_encrypt (setkey(pubkey); encrypt();)
	decrypt = private_decrypt (setkey_privkey(); decrypt();)
so thus far the cipher tfm and algs suffice.

Wow.  Death due to a lack of heap was not something I had considered.
So, since the include/linux/crypto.h:cipher_alg struct's encrypt and decrypt
functions return void, we may need to create a assymetric_alg struct whose
functions can return an error.

Thanks, Tom.  This is precisely what we were hoping.
thanks,
