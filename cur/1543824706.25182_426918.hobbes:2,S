Andrew,
I see you folded a bunch of doc patches together.  I just want to make
sure that the updates to my document recommended by Randy Dunlap were
not missed. I haven't received any verification that they went in.
Here's links to the patches I'm talking about.

It includes 4 out of 2 patches :)  The last two were add-ons that needed
to get done.
Or would it be easier if I fold these into one patch and send it to you?
Thanks,
