Can you please expand a bit on who on the host OS would actually communicate
with the management engine? It looks like this driver just exports
an interface to user space. What user space would use it and for
what?
I would be definitely interested in a way to save oops information
away using this.  I remember you had a demo for this, is support
for that coming soon?
