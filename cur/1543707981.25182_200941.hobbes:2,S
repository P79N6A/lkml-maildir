You don't need access to AIX source.  Reading the IBM Redbook on writing a
device driver for AIX is sufficient proof. Or even reading up on how to get
more heap space than the usual number of segment registers using the 'ld'
command (yes, it's userspace visible).
And Christoph isn't pulling your leg -  it's pretty bizzare...
