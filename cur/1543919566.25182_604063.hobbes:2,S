I think the Linux peak has always been roughly as good as their
best FreeBSD ones (eg. 
http://people.freebsd.org/~jeff/sysbench.png
).
Obviously in that graph, Linux sucks because of the malloc/mmap_sem
issue. It also shows what he is calling the terrible CFS peak, I
guess.
In my own tests, after that was fixed, Linux's peak got even a bit
higher, so that's the benchmark for performance.

OK good. Once that's fixed, we'll hopefully be competitive with
FreeBSD again in this test :)
