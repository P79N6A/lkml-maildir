We have had this problem for a long time.  When allocating large pages
we could find ourselves unable to allocate such a page nor reclaim one
for ourselves.  At this point we will OOM with little hope of that
actually changing the situation for the better.
As you say PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER pretty much defines the orders at
which any sort of guarantee of success is provided.  It seems preferable
to fail a allocations above this order/ than killing things to try and
make it available.  As higher order users already have to handle failure
to allocate they should be best equipped to continue.
