Is it at all probable at this stage that devfs will be a different
directory than "dev" ?
I just think that backward compatibility can be pseudo-maintained best
by having a /dev/ directory full of those generated names (like devfsd
or just symlinking) but having a separate hierarchial structure that's
still easy to peruse (for those new to the system) as they migrate.
/dev/sda3 -> /devices/scsi/a/3
/dev/usb14 -> /devices/usb/14
???
Disclaimer: I've missed a few of the posts on the subject since I only
follow via "kernel traffic" on Linuxcare.
