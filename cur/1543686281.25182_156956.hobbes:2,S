Nevertheless it is defined the inefficient way by the C-Standard and
lots of people actually really know this.
So IMHO (re)implementing a function called "strncpy" differently doesn't
make much sense.

The kernel is implemented in C. And the function strncpy() _is_ already
defined by C. So please use at least another name. Given the existence
of strlcpy() -  
http://www.courtesan.com/todd/papers/strlcpy.html-
 this
problem already has been solved.

ACK. To use strlcpy() is correct solution (if padding is not required).
