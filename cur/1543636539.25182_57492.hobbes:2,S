Well, I'll at least take a stab at it, but I won't have time until
next week.  Here's the current version of the macros against 2.5.26
though, in case someone wants to add support for architectures other
than ia64.

It doesn't look like it would be too hard to do, but seems like it
should be a seperate patch (maybe with more header file tweaking).

Sure thing.  I fixed it up in this version.
Thanks,
Jesse
