It's an Armada 1700, with a pII 300MHz (150MHz on battery). It doesn't
support cpufreq (I tried modprobing all drivers, none work), I must boot
with acpi=off if I want suspend-to-ram and suspend-to-disk to work (apm
works great on this machine). As said elsewhere in this thread, booting
with clock=pit solves my problem.
Yet I can investigate for you (send dmesg, test things) if you're still
interested.
Thanks,
