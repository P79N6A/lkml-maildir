From a point of view of a card user this looks like that:
 - there is a small number of cards, usually older ones, which
   will work only with de4x5 or will work better with it
 - there are various Tulip cards which maybe will work with
   a driver which is included in a kernel but will spit on de4x5
 - various newer 21143, especially from places like NetGear, will
   refuse to budge with both of the above and will require a
   driver from 0.90 series which you will have to grab from
   Donald Becker's page.
In other words - what fits depends really on your hardware and
hardware is not created equal.
