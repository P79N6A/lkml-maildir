That seems reasonable.  If we special case the definitions of NR_CPUS
and the use of them to define arrays of things both of which appear
reasonable,
	#define NR_CPUS 10
	int semid[NR_CPUS];
then it seems sensible to report this one:
	WARNING: usage of NR_CPUS is often wrong - consider using cpu_possible(), num_possible_cpus(), for_each_possible_cpu(), etc
	#1: FILE: Z101.c:1:
	+       for (i = 0; i < NR_CPUS; i++)
This will be in the next push to -mm.
