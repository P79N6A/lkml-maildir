Am developing a device driver in Linux using C, wherein the processes
communicate via a shared memory.
Can you please tell me how should I design the memory. whether it
should be at the kernel level or at the user level. And if at the
kernel level, give me the functions and APIs to use.
Thanks and regards,
Naveed
