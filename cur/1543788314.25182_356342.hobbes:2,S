I might have misunderstood but I think that if you buy the hardware you
cannot connect it to the DSLAM network anymore. So that only the boxes
they own are connected to the DSLAM.

Are you sure this point has been clarified in court in the past ?
If not, I would bet on it (for the specific case of settop boxes).

"internal use" is kind of a buzz word here and should probably be
clarified for this kind of cases.
For now, I really don't see the flaw in Free's argument.
I mentioned in another mail the case of a mobile phone network
infrastructure where the network nodes to which mobile phones are
connecting are running Linux. It seems to be an "internal use" (as it
never leak out of the company network) and yet providing a service to
customers.
The only difference in the Freeboxes case is that the node is at the
customer place (you can compare the customer's mobile phone to the
customer's computer plugged on the Freebox). But the fact that you don't
share your node with others and that you have it at home doesn't change
the fact that the company own it.
Has been any previous similar cases in the past which went in court ?
Maybe the best attack angle would be to say that if a GPL system is
interacting directly with a customer, then the source code should be
distributed. But I don't see if this requirement need changes in the GPL
(I'm ain't no expert).
