For MSI, the interrupt message number field may change if the Multiple
Message Enable Field was changed. On the other hand, for MSI-X, I think
the interrupt message number field is constant. This is what the "[...]
For a given MSI-X implementation, the entry must remain constant. [...]"
explains in PCI Express spec, I think.
