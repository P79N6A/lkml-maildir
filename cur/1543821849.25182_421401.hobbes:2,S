Hi,
anyone know if the now already somewhat old Streaming Feature Set of
ATA/ATAPI 7 is going to be implemented in the kernel ata functions?
According to one web site that contains hdreg.h
http://www.koders.com/c/fidCD7293464D782E48F93EEF8A71192F1BF28FC205.aspx
there's at least some kind of mention in that include file about streaming
feature set, kernel 2.6.10. However in 2.6.16 it seems to be gone again.
Any ideas if this will be implemented, or how to use it with e.g. hdparm
right now?
many thanks!
 - Jan
