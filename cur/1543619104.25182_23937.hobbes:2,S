Making it a CONFIG option would preclude leveraging the advantages of the 
radix tree that fall out from its ordered nature, so I'd vote for all or 
nothing in this case.
I also have some perhaps-twisted plans for this thing, but if this patch 
passes muster on its own merits - that is, in the context we're currently 
using the pcache hash as opposed to new capabilities that can be leveraged - 
that's the ideal situation.  Hence no, or minimal, talking up other 
advantages.
I'm inclined to think that the radix tree has locality advantages for UP as 
well as SMP, under certain types of filesystem loads, and that it is never 
worse.  Well, we shall see about that soon enogh.
