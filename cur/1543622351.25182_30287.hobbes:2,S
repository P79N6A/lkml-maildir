Hi,
I use the kernel 2.4.17 and the hotplug facilities for my 3com cardbus
(driver 3c59x). It works well when I insert and remove the card.   
But If I don't remove the card before suspending (apm -s) my laptop,
The card is in a bad state when I resume the laptop and I need to remove
and insert the card to get it back. I have tried to ifdown and rmmod
before suspending but the result is the same.
Am i missing something ?
I understand it is a resume/suspend issue (not a hotplug issue).
What need to be done in the driver to support the suspending of the
card ?
Christophe
