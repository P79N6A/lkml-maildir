	For HostAP, the kernel crypto doesn't include any RC4 support,
so it can't use kernel crypto as it is.
	For airo, crypto was added before kernel crypto was available
in the kernel, and I don't know how easy it will be to refactor the
code.
	I just wanted to know the position of Jeff on this issue. I'll
let the technical decision to the respective authors.
	Thanks...
	Jean
