you can ioremap ISA space on x86 as well. But there is old code that still
relies on readb/writeb(low_address) mapping to ISA space memory access.
2.3.23-pre simply goes the first step making all such read[bwl]/write[bwl]
access illegal (by printing a warning) - then we can make io_virt an
identity mapping.
