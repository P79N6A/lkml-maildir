Hm, I believe you are barking up the wrong tree. Either you are omitting 
too much information in your statement above or you are contradicting 
yourself.
What you are looking for is _exactly_ particular FS solution(s)! And in 
particular you are looking for a truly distributed file system.
I just get the impression you are not fully aware what a distributed FS 
(call it DFS for short) actually is.
In my understanding a DFS offers exactly what you need: each node has disks 
and all disks on all nodes are part of the very same file system. Of course 
each node maintains the local disks, i.e. the local part of the file system 
and certain operations require that the nodes communicates with the "DFS 
master node(s)" in order for example to reserve blocks of disks or to 
create/rename files (need to make sure no duplicate filenames are 
instantiated for example). -- Sound familiar so far? You wanted to do 
exactly the same things but at the block layer and the VFS layer levels 
instead of the FS layer...
The difference between a DFS and your proposal is that a DFS maintains all 
the caching benefits of a normal FS at the local node level, while your 
proposal completely and entirely disables caching, which is debatably 
impossible (due to need to load things into ram to read them and to modify 
them and then write them back) and certainly no FS author will accept their 
FS driver to be crippled in such a way. The performance loss incurred by 
removing caching completely is going to make sure you will only be dreaming 
of those 50GiB/sec. More likely you will be getting a few bytes/sec... (OK, 
I exaggerate a bit.) The seek times on the disks together with the 
read/write timings are going to completely annihilate performance. A DFS 
maintains caching at local node level, so you can still keep open inodes in 
memory for example (just don't allow any other node to open the same file 
at the same time or you need to do some juggling via the "Master DFS node").
To give you an analogy, you can think of a DFS like a NUMA machine, where 
you have different access speeds to different parts of memory (for DFS the 
"storage device", same thing really) and where decision on where to store 
things are decided depending on the resource/time cost involved. Simplest 
example: A file created on node A, will be allocated/written to a disk (or 
multiple disks) located on node A, because accessing the local disks has a 
lower time cost compared to going to a different node over the slower wire.
Your time would be much better spent in creating the _one_ true DFS, or 
helping improve one of the existing ones instead of trying to hack up the 
VFS/block layers to pieces. It almost certainly will be a hell of a lot 
less work to implement a decent DFS in comparison to changing the block 
layer, the VFS, _and_ every single FS driver out there to comply with the 
block layer and VFS changes. And at the same time you get exactly the same 
features you wanted to have but with hugely boosted performance.
I hope my ramblings made some kind of sense...
Best regards,
         Anton
