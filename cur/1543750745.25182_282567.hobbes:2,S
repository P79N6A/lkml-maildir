I would like to comment in that the issue is not exclusively targeted 
to stability, but the ability to keep up with kernel development. For 
example, it was pretty common for older versions of VMWare and NVidia 
driver to break up whenever a new kernel version was released.
I think it's a PITA for developers to rework some of the closed-source 
code to adopt the new changes in the Linux kernel.
