If you're talking about the problems that showed up for some (myself
included) with ppp "stalling" every few packets after upgrading to 2.2.x,
it has been resolved.  The bsd_comp module doesn't work with some ISPs.
The solution was to switch it off in /etc/conf.modules (for Debian).
Maybe this will help...
Please include relevant versions, log files, and diagnostic output if this
isn't what you're talking about...
