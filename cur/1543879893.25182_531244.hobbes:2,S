oh, i realize that a number of those examples from my earlier post
were already handled/being handled (i don't even look under OSS these
days when doing any cleanup).
my point was that, if ian's position is valid and stuff shouldn't be
removed without fair warning, then a lot of that stuff should get
entered into the feature removal file real soon now.

p.s.  again, if you run the simple grep i mentioned before:
  $ grep -iw obsolete $(find . -name Kconfig\*)
you find some odd combinations, such as this from net/ipv4/Kconfig:
config ARPD
        bool "IP: ARP daemon support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
        depends on EXPERIMENTAL
        ---help---
        ...
        This code is experimental and also obsolete...
the thought of something being both experimental *and* obsolete is a
bit weird, is it not?
