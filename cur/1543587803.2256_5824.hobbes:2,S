Ah, if you want to inc and dec all the time, yes.  But even if the
performance isn't hurt, it's unneccessary, and something else people
have to remember to do.
Simplicity is very nice.  And in the case of module unload, gives us
the ability to avoid the distinction between "am I calling into a
module?" and "is this fixed in the kernel?" at runtime.  A very good
thing 8)
