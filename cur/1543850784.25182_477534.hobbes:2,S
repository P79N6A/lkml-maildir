There's no need to parallelise the scanning of SCSI host adapters.
Indeed, it only causes pain.  With
http://git.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/jejb/scsi-misc-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=3e082a910d217b2e7b186077ebf5a1126a68c62f
and
http://git.parisc-linux.org/?p=linux-2.6.git;a=shortlog;h=scsi-async-scan
some bugfixing, and moving the scsi initialisation earlier (so it has
longer to complete while other things initialise), we should never have
to wait for scsi scans again.
And your devices only reorder as much as they ever used to with scsi.
