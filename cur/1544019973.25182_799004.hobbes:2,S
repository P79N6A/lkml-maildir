Yes, makes sense.
Back to my initial question: The problem arises for us because we depend
on permanent mappings of memory which were
 - allocated with alloc_pages() or alloc_page()
 - mapped into ring 3 with remap_pfn_range() and
 - pinned with get_user_pages()
There are potential pagefaults when touching into these ring-3-mappings
from ring 0. So I assume we could prevent such pagefaults if we access
that memory from ring-0-mappings, right? Unfortunately, the space for
ring-0-mappings (< 1GB) is smaller than userland (~ 3GB), at least on
32-bit systems.
Kind regards,
Frank
