I have to admit that "system freeze" is a quite unspecific
symptom. It could have a zillion of different reasons.
In my case I'm currently chasing SCSI errors which I think
could have something to do with it (besides, it's _not_ an Adaptec
controller, but a LSI 53c1030 with Fusion MPT driver... :-)
In my server logs I sometimes see SCSI timeouts like this:
[...]

There are 4 hot swap SCSI disks in the server, and all of them
eventually report those timeouts (so it's not specific to a single
disk)
I already replaced cabling, tried a different hot swap (SCA)
cage, and I'm now trying to replace the disks one by one to
eventually find the culprit.
There are two problems with this approach:
1.) After each change I have to wait several hours up to two
    days for a SCSI timeout to occur as I can not reproduce
    the problem at will.
2.) I'm not _sure_ if those SCSI timeouts are related to the server
    freeze symptoms I see. It's just an assumption.
    IMHO it could work as follows: SCSI timeouts occure somtimes.
    The driver then aborts the command and resets the SCSI bus
    to get it into a sane state again. But what if the bus reset
    doesn't work as expected and the bus remains unusable for a
    while? Could this bring the whole system into this "freeze"
    state (the system is still running, but everything waits for
    the SCSI bus to recover)? Could this explain the symptom of
    those big delays of ICMP ping answer messages I saw?
So the most precious resource for chasing this problem is time,
and this is also the resource which I don't have available as
much as I'd like to... :-(
