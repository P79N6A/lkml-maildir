emacs does mv file file~ before saving file so the edited file will
not be linked byt the backup file will be.  You can stop it doing this
by setting backup-by-copying-when-linked.
$ echo "Test1" >> test1
$ ln test1 test2
$ emacs test2 # modify and save the file
$ ls -i test*
2491498 test1  2491500 test2  2491498 test2~
However as Horst von Brand noted if you try this with (standard) vi
you will edit the linked file which is the same behaviour as if you
set backup-by-copying-when-linked in emacs.
