Am I understanding correctly then that using fork() is
faster/better?  Or should one use a state machine?  I'm just
asking out of curiosity because thread programming is new to me.
All portability issues aside, if one is writing an application in
Linux that one would be tempted to make multithreaded for
whatever reason, what would be the better Linux way of doing
things?
I've heard comments from Alan, and others in the past bashing
threads, and I can understand the "threads are for people who
can't write state machines" comments I've heard, but what other
ways are there of accomplishing the goals that threads solve in
an acceptable manner that gives good performance without coding
complexity?
This is all just curiosity.  I've considered trying some thread
programming, but if it is as stupid as it sounds, I'd rather
learn the "right" way of writing code that would ordinarily be
done with threads, etc..  Right now, I'm using fork() all over
the place and don't much care how much waste it is...  I'd like
to though.

Makes sense... if you understand the details of why threads
suck.  I understand there are some cache coherency issues, and
I've heard of other things as well, but is there an FAQ out there
saying "Why to not use threads?" that goes into good detail and
provides alternatives?

Works for me.  ;o)
