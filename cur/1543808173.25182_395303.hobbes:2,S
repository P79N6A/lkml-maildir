Dear All,
Please help me perform my case study over USB Host Hardware & general
stack Architecture. My idea is to understand the Hardware.
I would like to explore the complete USB Host side stack. I have seen
the Linus written early USB Debug Mouse Driver + Stack which is very
compact and I guess this will help be debug the USB Architecture in
whole.
I have downloaded the USB Stack from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/testing/old/usb/usb-0.01.tar.gz
I understand from the Makefile of this version of USB Mouse + stack is
for Linux 2.2v.
But, which version of Linux 2.2 should I use exactly. I have asked this
on USB Linux maillits. 
Which version of Linux is compatible with USB Stack?
Thanks & Regards,
Mukund Jampala
