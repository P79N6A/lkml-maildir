WTF not?  Consider, e.g. uml/i386 and uml/amd64.
In any case, there's no reason to mess with that at all.  This stuff is
trivally dealt with by a wrapper script that takes target name as its
first argument (the rest is passed to make unchanged) and figures out
ARCH, CROSS_COMPILE, SUBARCH and build directory by it.  End of story.
