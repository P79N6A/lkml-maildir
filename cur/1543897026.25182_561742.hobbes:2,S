Sure, but it's not an extension (yet), but an implementation
side-effect; it would have to be (semi-formally) defined in
the manual to be an extension.  Until that happens, anyone
using this "feature" risks haven his code broken at any time
(or, rather, his code already was broken but he didn't know
it).
See gcc.gnu.org/PR456 for more discussion.  Yes it's an old
bug...
