Hmm, wouldn't that be source and binary compatability?  If an app used
O_NDELAY and O_NONBLOCK interchangably, then a change to O_NDELAY would
break source compatability too.
Also, what do other UNIX OSes do?  Do they have seperate semantics for
O_NONBLOCK and O_NDELAY?  If so, then it would probably be better to change
O_NDELAY to be similar and add another feature at the same time as reducing
platform specific codeing in userspace.
