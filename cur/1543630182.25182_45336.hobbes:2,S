Well it would...

PCI IDs are 0xffff.  Normally that is supplied from the EEPROM (we think).
Try setting the NIC up with 3com's DOS-based setup program 
ftp://ftp.3com.com/pub/nic/3c90x/3c90xx2.exe
 and also check your
BIOS power management settings, PnP OS settings, etc.
Try to work out why the EEPROM hasn't been powered up - could be
a dead card (test it under Windows) or a BIOS thing.
