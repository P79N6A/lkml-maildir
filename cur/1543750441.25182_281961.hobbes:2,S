 contains the most recent available 
patches. I have a few build-fixes pending to submit to Andreas though, 
but those are just gcc-2.95 stuff. And you have to fix up one or two 
patch rejects on anything recent from kernel.org..
It got submitted for inclusion on LKML some time ago, and got a few 
kinks ironed out in that process. Not sure why it hasn't been included yet..
I'm using this set of patches on 2.6.10 and have not noticed any 
problems using it to date. SuSE seems to ship with them too, so it 
probably have had a lot of usage/testing out in the field.
