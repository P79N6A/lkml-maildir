Beats me, Clemens.  But at the time, I got curious and the problem was 
100% repeatable using the bz2 src code files I had.  The third time I 
went after the srcs and patches to build that kernel, I got the .gz 
versions of both, and they worked first time.  Then I went back to 
the .bz2's and was seeing the same problem as the first 2 downloads 
gave me.  I mv'd that src file & patch, went after the .bz2's again 
(for the 3rd time), and that time it worked flawlessly.  Both the 2nd 
and 3rd dl's files had the exact same md5sum too.  Go figure.
I think I had a similar problem when I built kde3.3 using konstruct 
recently.  Most of kde is packed as .bz2 files.  I forget which src 
code file it was now but after the second failure to build it, I 
nuked the src code file and all its cookies which made it go after 
another copy, and that one worked as expected.
bz2 problem?  DamnedifIknow.  snilmerg maybe?  But it goes away if I 
stick to the .gz's.
