Hi,
For a while, I have the same behavior. I tested under 2.6.23.9, 
2.6.24-rc3 and rc4. So all of these kernels have the same issue. Also, I 
don't use any proprietary driver. My video card is Intel-945 and I use 
the "intel" driver. I use 3D screensavers as well. These kernels die 
after some long idles like 1 or 2 days after. My distribution is Kubuntu 
7.10 and with Kubuntu kernel this behavior did not happened. So, how to 
track this interesting problem ? Any ideas welcomed :-)
Cheers,
