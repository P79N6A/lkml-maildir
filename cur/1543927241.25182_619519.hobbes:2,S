sidenote: the way i combat these missing pieces of instrumentation in 
the scheduler is to add them immediately to the cfs-debug-info.sh script 
(and to /proc/sched_debug if needed). I.e. if we get one report that 
misses a piece of critical information is OK, but if it's two reports 
and we still havent made it easy to report the right kind of information 
that is our fault entirely. This constant ping-ponging for information 
that goes on for basically every MM problem - which information could 
have been provided in the first message (by running a single, easy to 
download tool) is getting pretty hindering i believe.
