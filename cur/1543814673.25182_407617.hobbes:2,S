In looking at the patches in -mm, I see the following 5:
	secure-digital-host-controller-id-and-regs.patch
	secure-digital-host-controller-id-and-regs-fix.patch
	mmc-secure-digital-host-controller-interface-driver.patch
	mmc-secure-digital-host-controller-interface-driver-fix.patch
	mmc-sdhci-build-fix.patch
Is that all that is needed for this feature?
If so, I'll go try it out now...
thanks,
