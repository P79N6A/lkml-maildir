No problem, someone would have to do the merge anyway, either me, you or 
Greg, so I did it :)
I have been asked by Andrew to wait a few more hours after all the patches 
he has pending for upstream have been processed. In approximately 5 hours 
or so I am going to check mainline, make sure that my patches apply 
cleanly on top of that, and push them to Greg again and we'll see.
Thanks,
