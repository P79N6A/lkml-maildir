Hi,
I'm trying to build a kernel using the kernel source from Mandrake 9.1
When I try and go into the ALSA selection off the sound menu
menuconfig aborts with the following message:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Menuconfig has encountered a possible error in one of the kernel's
configuration files and is unable to continue.  Here is the error
report:
 Q> scripts/Menuconfig: line 832: MCmenu71: command not found
Please report this to the maintainer <mec@shout.net>.  You may also
send a problem report to <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>.
Please indicate the kernel version you are trying to configure and
which menu you were trying to enter when this error occurred.
make: *** [menuconfig] Error 1
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a standard Mandrake 9.1 kernel (which I realise isn't really
that "standard").  The only patching I've done to it is apply the User
Mode Linux SKAs patch.
I hope this is helpful to you.
Thanks
Andrew
