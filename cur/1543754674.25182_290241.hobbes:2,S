I also said, "but not quite".  The differences are noticeable, but I
believe they are manageable.  I could still be convinced otherwise,
however, by a sufficiently persuasive argument.  ;-)  
I don't claim to know about every realtime system.

Where does the standard actually say this?  All I found was the
reference[1] in my previous note.  It talks about queue management,
but not scheduling latency.  The scheduling order is only defined to
be deterministic within the SCHED_FIFO class.  Ingo's patch actually
conforms to this requirement fully, AFAICT.

I'm not trying to be a "standards lawyer" about this, and I can see
your point of view.  But, we should clearly distinguish what is
*required* by POSIX from what we feel to be good engineering practice.
Both are important.

Absolutely.  And getting noticeably better these days.

Well, this extremely long discussion started with a request on behalf
of a large group of audio developers and users for a way to gain
realtime scheduling privileges without running as root.
Several kernel developers felt that would be unacceptable, because of
the Denial of Service implications.  We argued that the owner of a
Digital Audio Workstation should be free to lock up his CPU any time
he wants.  But, no one would listen.  We were told that we didn't
really know what we needed, and were asking the wrong question.  That
was very discouraging.  It looked like LKML was going to ignore our
needs for yet another year.
Had I been in charge, I would have adopted our silly little RT-LSM
patch, declared victory, and moved on to other matters.  But, I'm not
responsible for this particular kernel.  (Thank you, God!)  So, I am
willing to defer to the prejudices of those who are.  But, the limit
of my deference is reached when they refuse to meet my needs.
When Con and Ingo started floating scheduler proposals, I tried to
help them produce something useful.  I think they have succeeded.
Is this the easiest way to meet our needs?  No way.  But it's not bad,
and I think it will work.  In some ways, it's actually better than our
original RT-LSM proposal.  Ingo's scheduler patch is not very large.

Setting RLIMIT_RT_CPU to 100% gives exactly what you are asking for.
In fact, I will probably lower it to 98%, taking advantage of the
scheduler's ability to throttle runaway threads.  Locking up the CPU
is not a big problem in my life, but it can be annoying when it does
occur.  The JACK watchdog does not catch every bug we see during
development.

I think I can do it either way.  
Further, I believe distributions will probably set a reasonably high
RLIMIT_RT_CPU for desktop users, allowing audio applications to work
quite well right out of the box.
I don't much like Mac OS X.  It annoys the hell out of me that they
can run Linux audio applications so much better than Linux.  According
to Stephane Letz (who did the JACK OSX port), their scheduler has a
similar throttle set at about 90%.  It does not seem to be causing
them any practical problems that I can tell.

I do care.  The average overhead of running a watchdog daemon at max
priority is tiny.  But, its impact on worst-case trigger latencies is
non-trivial and must be added to everything else in the RT subsystem.
