Me too.

It only happens when running Azareus with IBM's Java (our's isn't
ready yet).
So far I was able to reproduce the problem on all -mm versions within
one hour.  Otherwise the kernels seem to work fine -- no lockup unless
I run Azareus.
I'm running rc2-mm3 without the timer- patches now.  It's up for 6
days now and survived downloading all Ubuntu torrents over ten times.

I'm might be the only one using evdev on ppc64.
And I don't know how popular LVM2 is on disks with Macintosh labels.
I had to set it up manually when I installed the machine, Debian's
installer couldn't handle it at that time.
Workload is normal, the lockups happen with just X and Azaereus.
(The machine also runs mysqld, apache, and a few other daemons.  But I
don't have to put load on these to make the machine lock up.)
