Yes, I suppose so.
I note that generic_file_aio_write_nolock() for O_SYNC or IS_SYNC will end
up calling generic_osync_inode() twice.  Once in sync_page_range_nolock()
and once in __generic_file_aio_write_nolock->generic_file_direct_write or
in __generic_file_aio_write_nolock->generic_file_buffered_write
It's all a bit of a mess.  I guess we should sit down and work out where we
actually want to do all this syncing and get it done consistently and
completely, all at the same level.  A filemap.c call graph would be needed :(
