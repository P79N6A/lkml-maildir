Actually, the solution I think would be to use the MSDOS loader to boot
linux.  I will look at grabbing the ELF code in Linux and loading Linux
from MSDOS -- if this can be accomplished you're there -- with an added
benfit.  When I am debugging MANOS, the source files and OS actually
load from another NetWare server over a DOS connection (pretty slick) so
in my setup the files are always remote, though they could just as well
reside on a local fat partiton.  Having DOS resident underneath gives
you all kinds of cool stuff you can do (you will note that while MANOS
is active in memory, DOS is still resident underneath and accessible). 
Perhaps the way to do this unobtrusively would be a different loader for
Linux (a DOS loader) that will run the debugger underneath.  The
debugger in MANOS is self contained, and you will note has few
dependencies on the OS code of any kind -- it was developed this way
intentionally.  We just take the MANOS loader, rip out the kernel, load
Linux from LLOADER.386, and the debugger is there!
