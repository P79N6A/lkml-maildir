This doesnt hold up at all, because the *closed* vendor software for 
some 802.11? radios will give you option to set the 'country' (and 
hence power), eg Netgear WG602v2 (an ISL3893 running Linux + 
proprietary mini-RTOS for the 802.11 bits + proprietary Linux side 
drivers to communicate between the two.).
Also, doesnt the USA have higher limits than most other countries? So 
the problem if anything would arise in /other/ regulatory domains, 
not FCC/USA.
