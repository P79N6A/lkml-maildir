during the big first phase of unification we generally kept file names 
untouched if they were only present in one of the previous 
architectures. I.e. pure 32-bit and pure 64-bit files were not renamed 
to _32/_64.
Now that we've got lots of unified 32/64-bit files it might make sense 
to rename the 'standalone' ones into _32/_64 if they share the same 
directory with 32/64-bit source files - to reduce the confusion. And 
given that for example arch/x86/boot/compressed/misc.c is unified while 
arch/x86/boot/compressed/relocs.c is 32-bit only, i'd agree with your 
observation. Feel free to send a rename patch for such cases.
