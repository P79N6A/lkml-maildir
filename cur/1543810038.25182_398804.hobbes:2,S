What about the userspace visible API for things already using relayfs,
like systemtap ?  Whilst technically these patches may make sense,
yanking the rug underneath applications as soon as they've started
using it without warning or a migration period doesn't sound too good an idea.
It's taken us *years* to try and get rid of devfs, why should relayfs
get ripped out any quicker, when it has valid users?
