It lost me almost from the start, so you're not alone there. I think
it amounted to somebody complaining that certain brands of PC's have
clocks that vary far too much, and incorrectly attributing that fact
to the digits printed on the various clock crystals, but I could very
easily be wrong there...

I gathered that, and I didn't comment on the rest of your post since
not only did it do a good job of clearing that up, but several other
people had done likewise.
Best wishes from Riley.
