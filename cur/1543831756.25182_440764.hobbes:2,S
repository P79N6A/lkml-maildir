I don't think so as its prio value should cause task_in_background() to 
fail.

If it's !safe_to_background() it's in our interest to let it run in 
order to free up the resource that it's holding.

It's more than just stopping them end up in the expired array.  It's 
stopping them being permanently in the expired array.

The difference is that the background task could stay there forever.

In spite of my comments above, I agree that not expiring mutex holders 
might (emphasis on the "might") be good for overall system performance 
by reducing the time for which locks are held.  Giving them a whole new 
time slice on the active array might be too generous though.  It could 
become quite complex.
