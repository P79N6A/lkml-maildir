Yep, this is all clear, but not quite what this code does.

One special part of this is that the ops structure is never to be freed
(this is documented). It should be a static read-mostly structure.
Since it is not to be freed, I did not export the registered functions to
keep modules from using it. I may later add an export that will cause the
module to increment it's usage count so that it may never be freed.
There's no guarantees that prevent the func from being called after it was
unregistered, nor should the users of this, ever touch the "next" pointer.
This makes things easy when you don't need to free ;-)

hmm, I'm still not convinced ;-)
This is a unique situation. We don't need to worry about items being freed
because there's too many races to allow that. The items are only to
register functions and are not to be dynamically allocated or freed. In
this situation we do not need to worry about deletions.
The smp_wmb is only for initialization of something that is about to enter
the list. It is not to protect against freeing.
Specifically:
   ops->next = mcount_list;
   smp_wmb();
   mcount_list = ops;
What this is to prevent is a new item that has next = NULL being viewable
to other CPUS before next is initalized.
On another cpu we have (simplified by removing loop):
  op = mcount_list;
  op->func();
  op = op->next;
  if (op->next != NULL)
     op->func;
What we want to prevent is reading of the new ops before ops->next is set.
What you are saying is that on alpha, even though the write to ops->next
has completed before mcount_list is set, we can still get a reversed
order?
  ops->next = mcount_list;  -- in one cache line
  smp_wmb();
  mcount_list = ops;       -- in another cache line
Even though the ops->next is completed, we can have on another cpu:
   op = mcount_list; (which is the ops from above)
   op = op->next;  -- still see the old ops->next?
I just want to understand this. I already put in the read_barrier_depends
because it doesn't hurt on most archs anyway (nops).
