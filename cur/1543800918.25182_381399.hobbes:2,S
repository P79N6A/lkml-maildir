considering that alsa API and drivers is pretty stable i see no problem
in OSS removal.
When writing a program adding oss compatibility seems faster, but,
creates lots of problems.
check the skype example (yes i know it's closed-source). 99% of sound
problems users have is due to OSS driver usage.
that's a big problem. Needs a radical solution. Considering aoss works
in 50% of cases i suggest aoss improvement and not OSS keeping in kernel.
A good idea could be an OSS API layer over Alsa-lib...but i personally
don't know how much can that costs, considering you should link against
alsa-lib too.
This discussion seems a no-sense.
Kernel API continues to change every -rc and noone cares that.
OSS has been deprecated for a lot, and it's as old as moon.
