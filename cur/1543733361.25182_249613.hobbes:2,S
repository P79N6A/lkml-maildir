I hate the "byte at a time" interface.
That said, I think the "long at a time" interface we have now for bitmaps 
ends up being a compatibility problem, where the compat layer has to worry 
about big-endian 32-bit "long" lookign different from big-endian 64-bit 
"long".
So there are other issues here.
