Hmm...  a quick diff shows that you are quite right.  However the "SG stopped or paused" messages disappeared on my box as soon as I replaced 2.4.18-3 with the latest 2.4.18-pre10-acX tree, so I assumed that somewhere the appropriate tweeks had been made.
Though I did have to move to ALSA later on because of issues with the generic AC97 chip on my motherboard, and everything is working great now.  Perhaps you can try that instead?
