Bullshit. You clearly haven't got a clue what you are talking about.
For all these 3 systems credentials need to be cached from file open
to file close.
  YES EVEN NOW, WITH NO CLONE_CRED AND WITH SYNCHRONOUS OPEN !!!!
On something like NFS or Coda, the server needs to receive
authentication information for each and every RPC call we send to
it. There's no state. The server does not know that we have opened a
file.
Currently this is done by the NFS client hiding information in the
file's private_data field. This means that other people that want to
do write-through-caching etc are in trouble 'cos they have to cope
with the fact that NFS has its private field, Coda has its private
field,... And they are all doing the same thing in different ways.
Now stop trolling
