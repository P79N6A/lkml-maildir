Unfortunately smbfs hasn't had a breathing maintainer for a couple of years
and I do not know anyone who knows the code much at all.  The stock answer
here is that you should migrate to cifs, which is maintained.
If you are for some reason not able to do that then please make the reasons
for this known to the cifs maintainer.

This oops is really hard to follow.  Without a
compiled-with-CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO kernel it'll be hard to work out where it
crashed.  And it appears that RH do not ship kernels with CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO
set.  Or maybe they do have that as a download somewhere; I don't know.
One option would be to self-compile a kernel with CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO and
when it crashes, do
cd /usr/src/linux
gdb /path/to/vmlinux
(gdb) l *0xffffffff882ea8ff
(substitute in the correct RIP value when doing this).
Sorry, no easy answers there.
