Unfortunately zero-copy doesn't help to avoid the schedules:
Zero copy just avoid the copy to kernel - you still need one schedule 
for each page to be transfered.
writer calls
    for(;;){
        prepare_data(buf);
        write(fd,buf,PAGE_SIZE);
    }
reader calls
    for(;;) {
        read(fd,buf,PAGE_SIZE);
        use_data(buf);
    }
What's needed is a large kernel buffer - I've seen buffers between 64 
and 256 kB in other unices.
zero copy only helps lmbench and other apps where the whole working set 
fits into the cpu cache.
The difference between
    main-mem->cache;cache->main_mem [non-zerocopy]
and
    main-mem->main-mem [zerocopy, the copy to kernel is skipped]
is small.
