You missed out " and should be in RTLinux instead".

There's also the open invitation to go code up a better patch.
In fact, probably the best option is to write (or sponsor) a patch to
RTLinux so that Linux user-space processes can be scheduled by the
RTLinux scheduler. If you submit such a patch to Victor Y., and it was
configurable (so that you don't always have to pay the extra penalty
for swapping VM contexts), I would expect he'd accept it.
It would keep him happy (hard-core RT users still get the best
latencies), it would keep you happy (you get good latencies 100% of
the time) and it would keep Larry happy ("git the hell otta that thar
kernhal"). And as a bargain extra, it would keep me happy (I could
send in a patch ripping out SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_OTHER and hence clean
up the Linux scheduler).
