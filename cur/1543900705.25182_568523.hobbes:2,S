For that to work, the kernel being hibernated would have to know in advance
which devices would be needed by the image-saving kernel.

Yes, IMO that's an important observation.  We shouldn't unregister devices
at this point and thus we need additinal callbacks for that.

Agreed, but spinning disks down and up during hibernation is really annoying.

I think that if we are going to support suspend-to-both (as Pavel calls it),
the image-saving kernel will have to support exactly the same set of devices
as the hibernated kernel.  In that case, it will be able to put all devices
into low power states for the suspend.
There's one more reason why that may be necessary, actually.  Namely, on ACPI
systems we may want to put the system into the S4 sleep state after saving the
image instead of just powering it off.  In turn, putting the system into the S4
sleep state is very similar to suspending it.

Yes, that might be useful.

Yes, that's what I'm referring to.

No, the swaps are not turned off for hibernation.

I think that the image-saving kernel will need to access the hibernated
kernel's swap data structures to figure out which blocks are safe.  That won't
be very easy, though.

Yes, I remember that discussion.
Still, I think that there also is an advantage of using kexec here, since in
that case we won't need additional support from the architectures that already
support kexec.

Well, I know too little about kexec to be able to comment that.
