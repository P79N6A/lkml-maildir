But I'm still not happy with it :-(
I suspect there might be other cases where it will still do the wrong
thing.
The real problem is that we are updating events_cleared to early.  We
are setting to the new event counter before that is even written out.
So I've come up with this patch, which I think more clearly
encapsulated what events_cleared means.  It is now set to the current
'events' counter immediately before we clear any bit.
If you could test it, I'd really appreciate it.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
