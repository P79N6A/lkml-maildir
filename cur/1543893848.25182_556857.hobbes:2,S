    This is generally a bad practice to guess protocol based on opcode. What 
if the code will have to handle a vendor unique command (or some other command 
not yet known to it but known to issuer)?

    I'd agree here.

    Bad idea again.

    This is reasonable if DMA direction can also be inferred from the protocol 
number.

    I think it's better to allow inconsistency then to limit functionality.
There's another option though -- let the caller specify the default protocol 
for the command to be issued or override it if it *knows* what it's doing.
