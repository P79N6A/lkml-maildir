After re-testing it shows that the offset was really 4 bytes, not 2
(memory glitch in my brain :-)
But now I can confirm that it works when both the kernel and the
module are compiled with gcc 2.7.2.3. So we definitely have a compiler
conflict here and the already too long list of module requirements
gets another item: "Use the same compiler as for the kernel". :-(
