OK, interesting.  I have some questions below.

Kernels without this patch, I'd have to take VmRSS and calculate that
against VmLib, and then have to think about shared memory between threads
and I'm not sure what else.
If I want to get the memory used by all apps from /proc/$pid/status, how am
I going to calculate it with this patch, and how will it be more accurate
from what I'd have to deal with from 2.[246] as they currently are without
the patch?
Thanks,
Mike
