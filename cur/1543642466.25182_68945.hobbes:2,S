Ah sorry - I never meant to imply that Tux was detrimental, other
than one case where it seemed to have no benefit and the performance
numbers while tuning for TPC-W *seemed* worse but were never analyzed
completely.  That was the actual event that I meant when I said:
	We also had some bad starts with using Tux in terms of performance
	and scalability on 4-CPU and 8-CPU machines, especially when
	combining with things like squid or other cacheing products from
	various third parties.
Those results were never quantified but for various reasons we had a
team that decided to take Tux out of the picture.  I think the problem
was more likely lack of knowledge and lack of time to do analysis on
the particular problems.  Another combination of solutions was used.
So, any comments I made which might have implied that Tux/Tux2 made things
worse have no substantiated data to prove that and it is quite possible
that there is no such problem.  Also, this was run nearly a year ago and
the state of Tux/Tux2 might have been a bit different at the time.
