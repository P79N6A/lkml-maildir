But udev should probably also create all the sub-nodes if it doesn't 
already.
And it really has to create _all_ of them, exactly because there's no way
to know ahead-of-time which of them will be available.
Then, user space can just access "/dev/sda1" or whatever, and the act of 
accessing it will force the re-scan.
