Hello!
i write to the list to inform about this strange message that appears
on Kernel 2.0.3[56] and 2.2.0-pre[1-9] and final.
the strange thing is that sinsce i have this 6gig disk, wich is like
6 month ago, i have never a single problem with this disk, but is
annoying enough to write to the kernel developers, i can't remember
with wish 2.1.13[123] or 2.1.12[6789] kernel this message didn't show up.
any one had an idea about it?
Regards
