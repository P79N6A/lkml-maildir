One big raid-5 would have higher speed because it would have one more 
disk allocated to storing data rather than more parity.  The raid 5+0 
isn't really going to be any more reliable because it can withstand a 
single failure in either half, but not two failures in one half, so in 
the face of a double failure, you have a 50/50 chance of one being in 
each half.
