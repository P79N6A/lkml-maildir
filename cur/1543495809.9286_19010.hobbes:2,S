Greetings,
I have read (several times) Linus' excellent documentation on spinlocks in
Documentation/spinlocks.txt.  I have also read all of the spinlock-related
header files in the kernel.  This answers most questions, however, I have a
more fundamental issue I am still uncertain of.  That is generally when to
use a spinlock for situations where no interrupt is involved; i.e.
non-interrupt-related reentrancy.
For example, say I am about to muddle with some members of current.  If I
am in init_module() do I need a spinlock (like lock_kernel())?  How about
in a system call that has no chance of sleeping?  From within tq_scheduler?
What about within a kernel thread?  Say I do a "struct task_struct *task =
current" and then only access members through task; do I still need a
spinlock at all?
Thank you for any information,
-bp
