Please stop repeating that, no one said we should *not* implement a 64 bit
LUN in linux scsi, and James posted a patch for 64 bit LUN. I posted a
clarification in response to your earlier postings, you seem to have
ignored or forgotten this post:

I said:
"I am talking about the scsi spec, not the code. IMO linux scsi code
should support W_LUN and 64 bit LUN."
