I couldn't find any documentation about the API, so I wasn't sure
whether it is actually suppose to be the MAC address or "sockaddr".
In fact, earlier version of our userland code was assuming it
is just the MAC address, until we found that it doesn't work on
recent kernels.

The set_mac_address() functions for each network device driver make
that assumption:
static int set_mac_address(struct net_device *dev, void *p)
{
        int i;
        struct sockaddr *addr = p;

Note that in my example rta_len was tweaked to match the MAC address
size, but the the payload itself and the netlink message nlmsg_len
actually match the sockaddr alignment.
The real mismatch is that ida[IFLA_ADDRESS - 1] is (as you say)
suppose to be a MAC address, but the set_mac_address() functions
for each device assume that the RTA_DATA(ida[IFLA_ADDRESS - 1])
payload is a sockaddr.
