I'd like to test other mice too, but I have nowhere to connect them to. 
This box is 6 years old by now (and yet still going strong :-), so it
doesn't have all those post-modern connectors...
For completeness: very occasionally, X does survive an hour or so of
normal use. So much so that last night I even thought to have found a 
solution by changing a mouse-related bit in my kernel config. But today
it locked up again, causing me to loose a whole bunch of mails in the 
process. So I'm back to 2.5.31 once more.
I'm gonna try a non-smp 2.5.38 next, to see if that makes any difference.
