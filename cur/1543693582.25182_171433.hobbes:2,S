Gabor, 
	Here's a first "2.7 thoughts" listing with some questions...
2.7 features
*	slab allocation quota
*	ntfs full support
*	kernel web server (Interfaced to Roman config tool)
*	ipc to sysfs
*	complete user quota centralization 
*	Add _responsibilities_ for virtual process tree and possible
relation in oops cases 
*	Does the whole proc vm stuff root/box relevant ?I don't think
so....Hence, those proc entries deserve security relevant attributes 
*	Devices should be limited as well against bad usage(floppy defect),
viral activity(netcard rush)... 
*	All this guides me to a more global conclusion in which all that
stuff should be kobject registration relevant 
*	Meanwhile, we don't have a kobject <-> security bridge :( 
* bind mount support for all general mount options (nodev,ro,noexec etc)
  with SECURE implementation with any (maybe even future) filesystems?
* union mount (possible with option to declare on what fs a new file
  should be created: on fixed ones, random algorithm, on fs with the
  largest free space available etc ...)
<LVM ?
* guaranteed i/o bandwidth allocation?
* netfilter's ability to do tricks which OpenBSD can do now with its
  packet filter
* ENBD support in official kernel with enterprise-class 'through the
  network' volume management
< NFS ?
* more and more tunable kernel parameters to be able to have some user
  space program which can 'tune' the system for the current load,usage,etc
  of the server ("selftune")
<What parameters would you add in procfs ?
* more configuration options to be able to use Linux at the low end as well
  (current kernels are too complex, too huge and sometimes contains too
  many unwanted features for a simple system, though for most times it is
  enough but can be even better)
* Virtual machine support
<Maybe more 3.0 relevant ?
