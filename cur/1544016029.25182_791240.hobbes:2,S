Sure, been doing that already... :)
There's just sort of a huge gap between rt-schedulers and the normal
scheduler.

For sure this is nice for certain tasks. I'm not entirely convinced if
the average media player or Flash-plugin would or should start using these.
I believe both approaches could co-exist to address different needs.
SCHED_MM is for the average software and is in a sense similar to
SCHED_BATCH and SCHED_IDLE, just targeting different use cases.
Modification is reasonably small and shouldn't have any impact when not
used. Deadline scheduler would probably belong to the
SCHED_RR/SCHED_FIFO family?

Managing the budget in an average system will be painful. In a
completely embedded environment this is of course rather straightforward.
