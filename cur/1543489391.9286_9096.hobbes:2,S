Subject: Missing ppp-compress modules.

Hi. When I connect to the net with kernel 2.2.1 in my messages file I get
messages that say something like:
modprobe: Can't find ppp-compress-21, 24 and 26.
I wouldn't mind the messages just appearing in my message file, but with
out these modules loaded I only get like 2.2 kps downloads.
So what I'm wondering is how do I get the kernel to load these modules
when it needs it? I'm using slackware 3.6.
Something else I notice:
When I use the default 2.0.35 kernel that comes with slackware I get the
usual 3.2 kps downloads and those messages do not appear in the
/var/log/messages file. So how do I fix this, cause in the 2.2.1 kernel I
have sound support and would like to have the sound and the faster
downloads.
Thanks.
Tommy.
