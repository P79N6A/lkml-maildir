Subject: moved to 2.2.x; now dhcpcd can't set IP address?

Hello.  I installed 2.2.1 and now I am getting the following error
when dhcpcd tries to set the IP address:
Mar 31 05:00:22 home dhcpcd[428]: \
     ioctl SIOCSIFBRDADDR (ifConfig): Cannot assign requested address
Is there an easy fix for this?  I am going to try rebuilding dhcpcd
against the newer kernel headers; that seems like the only thing that
could make a difference like this.
Thanks,
Mark
