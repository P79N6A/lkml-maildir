Subject: [PATCH 1/7] iosched: introduce WRITEA
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/23/483

Introduce WRITEA as 3, and redefine SWRITE as 5.
I'm not sure if WRITEA will ever be used, though it would be better to
redefine SWRITE to avoid possible conflict with BIO_RW_AHEAD.
