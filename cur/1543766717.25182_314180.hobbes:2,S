No.  Why would you block?  You can have transactions without blocking
other processes.
When updating, say, the core-utils package (which contains cat),
there's no reason why a program which executes "cat" should have to
block during the update.  It can simply execute the old one until the
new one is committed at the end of the update.
It's analogous to RCU for protecting kernel data structures without
blocking readers.
