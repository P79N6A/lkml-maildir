Nevertheless "nice" is still useful.  I'd bet that just about every 
Linux system has at least one task with non normal nice at any time.
I think that these caps can be similarly useful.
They can be also used as the basic mechanism to implement the kind of 
thing you want from OUTSIDE of the scheduler.

This still doesn't make it useless.
