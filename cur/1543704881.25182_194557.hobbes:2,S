It just won't really work for platforms with inexact MCEs for IO errors.
And even for those with exact MCEs it would probably be a nightmare
to implement (writing MCE handlers is extremly hard because you cannot
rely on any locking guarantees - even a printk can randomly deadlock)
For those the per pci_dev callback is the only realistic way.
