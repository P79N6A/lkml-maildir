   This seems to be happening because we now allow sg merging through
   the BIOVEC_MERGEABLE macro. On ppc64 (and sparc64) we can coalesce two
   sg entries if the first one ends on a page boundary and the next one
   starts on a page boundary because we have an IO MMU. (I know that you
   know this, Im just explaining it for those who dont :)
In that case you perhaps should be defining DMA_CHUNK_SIZE in
asm/dma.h :-)
