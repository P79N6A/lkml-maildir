.. but without a regression, it's obviously a post-2.6.22 thing, I guess I 
should make that clear, just because I think people send me patches after 
-rc1 way too eagerly just because they think it fixes a bug.
Basically if it's not somethign that has _ever_ worked some way, it's not 
a bug, it's a feature ;)
