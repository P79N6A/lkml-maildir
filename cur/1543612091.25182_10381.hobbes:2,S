Right, there's a consensus that the fs includes have to fixed and that it 
should be in 2.5.lownum.  The precise plan isn't fully evolved yet ;)
See fsdevel for the thread, 3-4 months ago.  IIRC, the favored idea (Linus's) 
was to make the generic struct inode part of the fs-specific inode instead of 
the other way around, which resolves the question of how the compiler 
calculates the size/layout of an inode.
This is going to be a pervasive change that someone has to do all in one
day, so it remains to be seen when/if that is actually going to happen.
It's also going to break every out-of-tree filesystem.
