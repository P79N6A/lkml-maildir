Thanks.  This rings a bell, I seem to remember what I thought to be
"impossible numbering" on the CPUs such as "CPU7" or somesuch in a
dmesg.. Will have to look through logs.  I'll raise CONFIG_NR_CPUS and
see what I get.  Now, the question is, why do we only interrupt on CPU0
on this pasrticular box|chipset with a vanilla kernel? ACPI problem?  My
SMP G4 ppc has an option in menuconfig: "distribute interrupts on all
CPUs by default", the x86 has no such option.
