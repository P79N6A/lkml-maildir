probly not really.  But putting it into lib.a has problems, and making it a
loadable module has problems, and making it Kconfigurable has problems. 
And it's only 150-odd bytes.
It'd be better to just start to use it.  There are a number of callers of
get_random_bytes() who just don't need such fanciness (and degradation or
/dev/urandom), such as ext2/3/4's Orlov allocator.
