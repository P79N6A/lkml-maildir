Hello,
     I want to save the system call parameters in a
table. I want to do this from the kernel module. For
that, I want to replace the already existing system
call handler by my own. Are there any other mechanisms
for doing this without exporting system call table? If
it is then plz suggest any one of them?
Thanks,
selva
