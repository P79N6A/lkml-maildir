I just re-ran that test (see my post on nanae).  They appear to have closed 
that hole.  Perhaps the controversy is having a beneficial effect.
For more info on the debate, see

I've been brainstorming ways to deal with this dilemma.  Here's one idea:
  Consider a netblock of commercial customers of an ISP, all of
  which are operating their own mail hosts.  The ISP requests
  that ORBS not scan his netblock.  ORBS lists the netblock as
  "unscanned".  (This is the current situation.)
  Perhaps ORBS could instead list the netblock as 'unscanned but well-policed' 
  if no addresses in the entire netblock currently appear in MAPS.
  In other words, unscanned netblocks are like coal mines, and
  a MAPS listing is like a dead canary... ORBS would list for each
  coal mine whether its canary was alive or dead.
Is this a reasonable way to increase the value of the information
served by ORBS, i.e. would this reduce rejection of good email?
