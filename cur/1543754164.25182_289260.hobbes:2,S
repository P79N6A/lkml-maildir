Andreas,
I'm starting to think the bug I saw is hardware error. I just got this
while trying to reproduce it tonight:
Jan 24 02:43:32 dev4-003 kernel: qlogicfc0 : abort failed
Jan 24 02:43:32 dev4-003 kernel: qlogicfc0 : firmware status is 4000 4
Jan 24 02:43:32 dev4-003 kernel: scsi: Device offlined - not ready after error recovery: host 3 
channel 0 id 1 lun 0
I'll see if I can get this confirmed tomorrow.
Cheers, Tridge
