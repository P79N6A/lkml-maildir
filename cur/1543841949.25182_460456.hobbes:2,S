Thanks for your explanation. Now it's the time to delete mmio_enabled
and merge slot_reset with resume.

I agree.

Is it the exclusive reason to have multi-steps?
1) Here link reset and hard reset are hardware operations, not the
link_reset and slot_reset callback in pci_error_handlers.
2) Callback error_detected will notify drivers there is PCI errors. Drivers
shouldn't do any I/O in error_detected.
3) If both the link and slot are reset after all error_detected are called,
the device should go back to initial status and all DMA should be stopped
automatically. Why does the driver still need a chance to stop DMA? The
error_detected of the drivers in the latest kernel who support err handlers
always returns PCI_ERS_RESULT_NEED_RESET. They are typical examples.

Above discussion is only about if mmio_enabled is needed.
As for slot_reset, I think it could be merged with resume, because platforms
do nothing between calling slot_reset and resume. Any comment?
