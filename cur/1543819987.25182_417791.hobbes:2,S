For strace -e what you say is reasonable, since it will set only a few bits to 
1 (the ones for the requested syscalls) and everything else to 0. Also, 
there's a problem for this case since the host will 1-extend the mask, so an 
old strace would trace some unwanted and unknown syscalls. I.e. we want here 
to 0-extend the mask and only maybe complain for bits set to 1.
For UML, instead, it's important to set that some peculiar syscalls are not 
traced, that the mask is 1-extended and that errors are reported.
So, I suggest a "flags" parameter for this. Sadly, we're using the ptrace() 
syscall and there's no 5th argument normally, we could either use it (IIRC 
some calls use the 5th regs indeed), or pass as "data" a struct with flags 
and the mask.
The flags could be:
MASK_DEFAULT_TRACE (set the default to 1 for remaining bits)
MASK_DEFAULT_IGNORE (set the default to 0 for remaining bits)
MASK_STRICT_VERIFY (return -EINVAL for bits exceeding NR_syscalls and set 
differently than the default).
probably with a reasonable prefix to avoid namespace pollution (something like 
"PT_SC_-").

This one is at all correct - that printk is only meaningful for debug.

No, you misunderstood the code, it does the opposite very different - the loop 
will detect the syscalls that the process wanted to ignore but don't exist. 
For the UML case, it needs it must trace that syscall and execute it on his 
own rather than rely on the host performing it.
