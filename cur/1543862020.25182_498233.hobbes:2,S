A cpu hotplug should happen between LOCK_ACQUIRE/RELEASE

Why? mutex_lock() taken in LOCK_ACQ will just block those functions
(cache create etc) from proceeding simultaneously as a hotplug event.
This per-subsystem mutex_lock() is supposed to be a replacement for the global
lock_cpu_hotplug() lock .. 
But the whole thing is changing again ..we will likely move towards a
process freezer based cpu hotplug locking ..all the lock_cpu_hotplugs()
and the existing LOCK_ACQ/RELS can go away when we do that ..
