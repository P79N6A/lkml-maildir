Machine info attached as a part of /dev/proc. i've tried with another AT 
keyboard and PS/2 keyboard attached via connector - results were the 
same. keyboard i'm using is: chicony model KB-5911 serial 6A00152705. 
what does it mean 'ancient'? mine keyb has about 10 years. is it ancient 
or not (it is the first keyboard i've been using)?
