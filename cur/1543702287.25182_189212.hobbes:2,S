I think it's a good beginning.  However, there are some things that
could be done to improve it.

This won't quite do beacuse tul_reset_scsi_bus() has some really nasty
properties
Under the old error handler, the reset routine was responsible for
resetting the bus, waiting the timeout (which tul_reset_scsi_bus() does
with a busy wait) and flushing the queue.
In the new scheme, the eh thread takes care of all of this (including a
nice thread based wait).
I think this may all work correctly if you change this call to:
tul_reset_scsi(pHCB, 0);
instead.  That should simply reset the bus and not busy wait at all,
which is really what the error handler is expecting.
