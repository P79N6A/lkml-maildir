Linux can still detect the chip and drive it natively even if the bios
is emulating IDE/PATA on the chip.  And libata will make both PATA and
SATA show up as /dev/sda now if you use libata for both.  On the other
hand if the bios has configured the intel chip to use the standard ide
registers, then it can't have configured the marvell to do so I would
guess, which could make it difficult to talk to.
