Would be fun though.  :)
I thought about using another acronym for port multiplier too.  But the 
spec uses that acronym all over the place, PM, PMP (Port Multiplier 
Portnumber), which reminds me of USB full/high speed fiasco.
Urghh... I thought we could use power for power management inside libata 
but that might be a bad idea.  So, PMS?
