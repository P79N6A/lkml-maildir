Well, the whole point of this patch set is _not_ to use the 2.5 ide core
for now. When configuring your kernel, you get the choice of using
2.4-ide or 2.5-ide. If you choose 2.5-ide, then yes you should add those
patches (I guess). If you choose 2.4-ide (which most users of the patch
set would do, why else apply it?!), then it doesn't matter.
