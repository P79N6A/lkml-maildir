Subject: [Announce] sg3_utils-1.14 available
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

sg3_utils is a package of command line utilities for sending
SCSI commands to devices. This package targets the lk 2.6 and
lk 2.4 series. In the lk 2.6 series these utilities (except
sgp_dd) can be used with any devices that support the SG_IO
ioctl.
This version adds sg_rmsn to read media serial number(s).
The tarball contains a spec file for building rpms. That
spec file builds two binary rpms: sg3_utils and libsgutils.
In the future my plan is to make other utilities such as
sdparm depend on libsgutils. See CHANGELOG for other changes.
A tarball, rpm and deb can be found on (see table 2):

For an overview of sg3_utils see this page:

The sg_dd utility has its own page at:

A changelog can be found at:

A release announcement has been sent to freshmeat.net .
