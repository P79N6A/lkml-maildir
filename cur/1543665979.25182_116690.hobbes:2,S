From a bit different point of view and in general this is much better.

The Code part of the Oops shows what's after EIP (i386). It's also
important (if not more) what's before. I fail to see the difficulties
to add this feature (or was it dropped?), ksymoops should handle it.
Real world example: I've spent 2 days trying to find a kernel
configuration that both builds and works (ordinary hardware and I'm
using Linux for 8 years) then 3 days waiting for data I asked for. If
the above info was in Oops it could be told immediately with very high
probability by somebody who knew already about this compiler bug.
