Arrgh.
1. If you want to remove the file contents use cat /dev/null > file_name
2. If work in heterogenuos environment you _can't_ rely on non-standard
link() semantics.
3. unlink() _never_ used to remove file. It removes one of the references
and not every reference sits in filesystem.
4. all nasty effects can be emulated with open(), which is _not_ a thing
you can change.
