If two seeks overlap, can't you end up with an f_pos value that is
different than what either thread seeked to? or if you have a seek and
a read overlap can't you end up with the read occurring in the midst
of an update of f_pos (which takes more than one instruction on
various architectures), e.g. reading an f_pos, which has only the
lower half of a 64 bit field updated?   I agree that you shouldn't
have seeks racing in parallel but I think it is preferable to get
either the updated f_pos or the earlier f_pos not something 1/2
updated.
