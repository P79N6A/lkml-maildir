Subject: ide-scsi problem in 2.3.17/18
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

[1.] One line summary of the problem:
ide-scsi has a problem in 2.3.17/18
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
[root@wr5z linux]# mount /dev/cdrw
mount: the kernel does not recognize /dev/cdrw as a block device
       (maybe `insmod driver'?)
dmesg (output included) shows that the ide-scsi device is not being
recognized as it was in 2.3.15 and prior.  ide-scsi, scsi support, and
scsi cdrom support was included in the kernel as shown in the included
config output.  lilo.conf (included) shows hdd=ide-scsi.  On my system
/dev/cdrw is a symlink to /dev/scd0.  This stuff all works in 2.2.12.
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
scsi, kernel, ide, ide-scsi, scsi
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
