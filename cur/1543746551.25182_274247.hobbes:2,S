Tell me I'm being silly, Martin, but wouldn't it be wiser to stick with
setup_arg_pages32 (with Nanhai's patch) for 2.6.10, then remove it after?
I'm cautious here because about six months ago I sent Andrew a patch
which eliminated setup_arg_pages32 (or equiv) from the three arches,
but the x86_64 one just wouldn't boot on Andrew's machine.  Both hch
and I spent hours staring at the code, neither of us could work out why.
Now, s390 may be greatly superior ;) but all the setup_arg_pages32
redefining is twisty weird stuff - good to be rid of it, but right now?
