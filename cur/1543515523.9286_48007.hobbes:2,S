I still don't see the point of doing a kcalloc() except for making
driver code slightly prettier. You have to remember that full pages
grabbed by the mm system do not come out of kmalloc() but
get_free_pages().

It's possible that pre zeroing pages for the mm system might be a win,
and if so it is probably a good thing to explore, however we are
talking two different things here. In the pre-zeroed cage you don't go
through kmalloc and kmem_cache_alloc (SLAB) at all.
