And with egcs 1.1.2. So 
	egcs is a different format to all others
	2.95 is a different format to all others
	2.96 is a different format to all others
and 2.96 is a C++ compiler

The 2.96 tree is maintained actively. Updates for the Red Hat 7 packages
are being worked on and CygnusHat people are working on both that maintenance
and on feeding all they find back to the core gcc team.
In fact we have sufficient faith in it we sell packages and support based around
that and our preparedness to support it.

I asked Jakub. He's confused as to your report. As far as he is aware the only
X problems in the CVS tree were related to XFree86 source code bugs misusing
type punning. If you have a case to lookat Jakub would love to hear about it
and fix either X or gcc.

That it was confusing and mistaken by some as an official GNU group release
is something we never intended and have already apologised for. It was done
without malice or ill intent.

We strongly recommend that people use 6.2 for developing binaries for general
release unless they have specific requirements for glibc 2.2. Thats the same
guidelines the LSB 'oops we havent finished yet here is a quickie for now'
documentation recommends.
Similarly RPM packaging using RPMv3 is recommended.
