Rusuu, you failed to understand that I not only understood your attack,
but also disregard it as minor imperfection (warning: personal opinion).
Reason:
This watermarking evidence can't be used at court, because it does not
reveal the content (at least not in my country!). Even if the
watermarking domain has a bigger cardinality than 32, I doubt the
practical implications.
However, if you haven't understood it already, one more time just for
you: I vote for changing the IV scheme, see my posting from 23.2.2004
[1]. But as you might not know (because you never contributed anything
substantial to the kernel): Kernel developers try to get things right,
and using CryptoAPI for hashing IVs results in some problems if one
wants to avoid reinitializing the context every call:
