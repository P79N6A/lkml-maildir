There have been no changes in the advansys driver since November 2005, and
nothing substantial in over a year.  So I'd say what we have here is either
a faulty .config or a bug.
Please check the .config and if it looks OK, provide a full description of
the problem.  It may be useful to do
boot (2.6.15)
dmesg -s 1000000 > 1
boot (2.6.16)
dmesg -s 1000000 > 2
diff -u 1 2 > 3
and include `3' in the report.
Thanks.
