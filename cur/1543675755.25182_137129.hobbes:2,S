Umm, I think those ";" should be "," otherwise you get a
parameter `insn' has just a forward declaration or some such error.
I have used more traditional style where the new Linus style was not
warranted.  Here is the patch for fs/jfs/jfs_xtree.c:

 	xtpage_t *p;
I haven't yet sent that to the maintainer (worked until late last night
and still getting -ENOTENOUGHCOFFEE from brain).  
Anyway, I agree that more traditional styles should be used unless
otherwise indicated, but having the return type on the same line as the
function name is something I've warmed up to.  And I can remember
14-character filenames and being able to print out the entire kernel in
less than 20 minutes on the line printer.  That was 8 or 9 years before
linux 0.01.  Yes, I'm an old-fogey.
