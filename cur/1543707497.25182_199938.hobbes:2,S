Hi,
I think this is a known problem, but I don't know how to fix it:
I have a dual Pentium-2 machine (non-SCSI Asus P2B-D), latest BIOS with
ACPI etc. It has an ISA card (serial port) using IRQ 9 (I can't change
the IRQ). It works fine without ACPI, Linux 2.4 lists IRQ 9 as
APIC edge-triggered.
With acpi=force (due to BIOS date) IRQ 9 is used by ACPI. /proc/interrupts
lists it as APIC level-triggered, and the ISA card no longer generates
interrupts.
IRQ 9 is set to "ISA" in BIOS setup. acpi_irq_isa=9 doesn't help.
Is is possible to fix it? Or is it just impossible to use ISA IRQ 9
with ACPI?
More details available on request, of course.
