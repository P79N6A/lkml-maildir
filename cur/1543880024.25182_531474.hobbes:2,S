I meant that it's indicative of the amount of work that you have to do 
to implement a new scheduling discipline for evaluation.

Yours is one of the smaller patches mainly because you perpetuate (or 
you did in the last one I looked at) the (horrible to my eyes) dual 
array (active/expired) mechanism.  That this idea was bad should have 
been apparent to all as soon as the decision was made to excuse some 
tasks from being moved from the active array to the expired array.  This 
essentially meant that there would be circumstances where extreme 
unfairness (to the extent of starvation in some cases) -- the very 
things that the mechanism was originally designed to ensure (as far as I 
can gather).  Right about then in the development of the O(1) scheduler 
alternative solutions should have been sought.
Other hints that it was a bad idea was the need to transfer time slices 
between children and parents during fork() and exit().
This disregard for the dual array mechanism has prevented me from 
looking at the rest of your scheduler in any great detail so I can't 
comment on any other ideas that may be in there.

I like Con's scheduler (partly because it uses a single array) but 
mainly because it's nice and simple.  However, his earlier schedulers 
were prone to starvation (admittedly, only if you went out of your way 
to make it happen) and I tried to convince him to use the anti 
starvation mechanism in my SPA schedulers but was unsuccessful.  I 
haven't looked at his latest scheduler that sparked all this furore so 
can't comment on it.

In the highly unlikely event that you can't separate them on technical 
grounds, Occam's razor recommends choosing the simplest solution. :-)
To digress, my main concern is that load balancing is being lumped in 
with this new change.  It's becoming "accept this beg lump of new code 
or nothing".  I'd rather see a good fix to the intra runqueue/CPU 
scheduler problem implemented first and then if there really are any 
outstanding problems with the load balancer attack them later.  Them all 
being mixed up together gives me a nasty deja vu of impending disaster.
