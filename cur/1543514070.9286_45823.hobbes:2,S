Even when marked with __initdata, doesn't it have to fit in the compressed
kernel file that LILO loads? People are already saying that file is reaching
the limit.
There is also the problem with PCI derivatives like cardbus and such, which
allow hot swapping. All of the sudden, you need those names on a dynamic
basis. I know that the current Linux driver design doesn't cover
hot-swapping, but I'm assuming that people will want to get there someday.
I really think it is a good idea to keep the kernel using just the numeric
values, let some userland utility convert the numbers to text.
