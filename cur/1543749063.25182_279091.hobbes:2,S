I think he means the other way.
	cat foo
is the same as
	cat foo/.../filebody
where "filebody" is some sort of link to (maybe) foo/.../glued.
Understand that you want to allow "normal" files which are not "glued"
anything, but also "glued" files which are composed of sub-files.

If the filesystem does caching, I'd rather have a type of executable
which, read normally, appears as a stream of its own standard output.
You'd get the actual file as something like bar/.../source.
This could be done with pipes and daemons, but it's not as easy to
manage and seems impossible to do as efficiently (with built-in caching,
etc.)

Right.
Also, there should be an inverse. For instance, a file-as-directory type
object should have a "contents" object, usually a normal directory, but
which could conceivably be any type of object, including a code-ish
object which implements a filesystem. Accessing foo/ would be the same
as accessing foo/.../contents, only because "..." (or whatever we use
for meta-files) is outside the actual directory namespace,
foo/.../contents/... refers to the metas of object "contents", which are
different than the metas of object "foo".
These two steps essentially create userspace "plugins", and do away with
having to mount other kernel layers such as lufs (or whatever its
current implementation is). It does have one important implication, though:
It's important that "metas" or "..." or whatever we've decided on should
_not_ be mutable by a "userspace" plugin that I have described, nor
should any meta-files created by kernel plugins. There would be other
security implications, of course -- user should still not be able to
create files that are owned by other users and setuid. I'm not sure
where such checks should go, but we want mortal users to be able to add
whatever plugins they want, while super-users can feel safe using the
metas interface to manipulate user files.
I think the issues with directory-as-a-file were the same problems you
get when you allow hardlinked directories -- that you'd eventually have
to ditch reference counting for a garbage collector, which is hellishly
impractical. I don't have a solution to that, other than dropping
hardlinks entirely.
Hmm. Why do we need hardlinks? I forget.
