Hm, I still don't agree :)

No, even with rcu versions, I don't see the need for this in the api.
Sure, for this specific implementation of a atomic_t, it is useful, as
the value is checked.  But that means that you might just want to use an
atomic_t, as it doesn't fit the model of a struct kref at all (something
where you don't touch the reference count directly at all.)
Becides, I don't think that people are convinced that this code needs to
be changed anyway :)
