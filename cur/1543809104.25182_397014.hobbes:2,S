sorry for that.  I honestly don't have the time to track two trees, and
I do all my development work against Linus' main tree, therefore my
patches are against that tree, too.

The question is: Why wouldn't my patch directly go mainline but rather
via -mm?  It is a very special-purpose device, the number of users are
small, it clearly fixes the bug that no device nodes are created, and
the fix came from the original maintainer.

Thanks, I'll cook up a fix.
