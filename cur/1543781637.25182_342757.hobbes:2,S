The fact that this is enabled under the experimental
CONFIG_MMC_BULKTRANSFER seems unfortunate.  I mean, if the code works OK
then we should just enable it unconditionally, no?
I'm thinking that it would be better to not have the config option there
and then re-add it late in the 2.6.14 cycle if someone reports problems
which cannot be fixed.  Or at least make it default to 'y' so we get more
testing coverage, then remove the config option later.  Or something.
Thoughts?
