This is usually only a problem on SMP motherboards.  In that case, I tell
people to boot the kernel with the option noapic and see if it helps the
problem.  In any case, linux isn't reading your IRQ routing information
properly either due to a linux bug or a buggy BIOS.  You could bring this
problem up to Ingo Molnar if this is an SMP motherboard *and* noapic helps, or
bring it up to Martin Mares otherwise since it would likely be a PCI problem.
