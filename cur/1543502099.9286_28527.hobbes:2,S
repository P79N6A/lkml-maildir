Hi !
 Currently I am writing a SANE backend for a scanner (AVISION AV530CS).
 I have trouble with reading data from the scanner: Sometime data
 transfer stops (command READ) for unknown reasons. 
 Is there any known  problem with the generic SCSI interface in the
 current kernel version?
 Any help VERY appreciated!
