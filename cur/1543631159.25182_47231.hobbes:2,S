This points very strongly towards an overheating problem. The 1800+ and 
higher CPU's run very hot. Any imperfection in the cooling setup, be 
it lack of thermal paste, undersized heatsink/fan combination, 
improperly seated heatsink, and even insufficient airflow around the
CPU's and inside the chassis, can and will cause crashes under load.
I had this exact problem a few weeks ago with a dual Athlon 1U setup. It
turned out that the aluminum heatsinks I had previously used for the
1.2GHz Athlons weren't good enough for the 1900+, and also that the
chassis fans were circulating enough air. Switching to copper heatsinks
got rid of 95% of the crashes, and adding a chassis fan got rid of the
remaining 5%.
