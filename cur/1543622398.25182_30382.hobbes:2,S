Any kernel special cases it adds will be unswappable because they are in
kernel space (not the semaphores here - we want them to be swappable and
they can be)

When you create a shared mapping by passing -1 to mmap we do
        } else if (flags & MAP_SHARED) {
                error = shmem_zero_setup(vma);
shmem_zero_setup does
        file = shmem_file_setup("dev/zero", size);
        if (IS_ERR(file))
                return PTR_ERR(file);
        if (vma->vm_file)
                fput (vma->vm_file);
        vma->vm_file = file;
        vma->vm_ops = &shmem_vm_ops;
and we are back creating file names. Basically because a shared mmap in
Linux needs vma->vm_file, and vma->vm_file needs all the rest of the logic
behind it
Thats why I am saying that magic name picking is something that user space
might as well do for unnamed objects. We end up with names and vm_file
however we do it
