With CONFIG_NR_CPUS increased from 8 to 64:
2.6.18     see no change in fork time measured.
2.6.19-rc5 see a 138% increase in fork time.
When I increase CONFIG_NR_CPUS to 128, the child process
from fork got killed when it executes sched_getaffinity call
in the routine to pin the process onto a processor.
This happened for both 2.6.18 and 2.6.19-rc5.
I'll need to check more carefully what lmbench is doing
there.
