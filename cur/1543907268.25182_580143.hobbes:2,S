I'm not sure if this is the answer that you looking for, but yes you
certainly will find fixed bug is older version of the tree.

If it's a kernel bug it's not going to matter if you use a xenomai skin

you really need to test your app on a current version of the kernel ..
We as developers generally don't support out dated trees..
