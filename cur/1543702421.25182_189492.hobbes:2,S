Yes, both of those are valid device IDs (which is probably why the
dropped 3 didn't get noticed right away, it still compiled).  But are
there any cards out there that bear LSI Logic's vendor ID (1000) and the
MegaRAID version 1 device ID (9010)?  I'm thinking not.
Since LSI just started making MegaRAID cards at version 3.  That is what
I ment was invalid, the full line, LSI + MEGARAID.  All cards with
LSI_LOGIC as the vendor will be MEGARAID3 (1960).
The older version of megaraid.c didn't include an LSI + MEGARAID, but
did have an LSI + MEGARAID3.  The new version was the other way around,
and didn't detect my card any longer.  In my first patch, I just added a
new ID.  But after a little thinking and back tracking, I figured it was
probably a copy and paste error, and the '3' was dropped from the device
ID.  A new defination wasn't needed, just a correction to the mis-copied
one.
