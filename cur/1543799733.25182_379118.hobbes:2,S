if you have write permission in the directory you're allowed to
1) create new files
2) rename existing files
3) delete files
4) rename files over existing files (combo of 2 and 3 sort of)
so an "edit" as you describe is
* create a new file with the new (eg modified) content
* rename the new file over the existing file
that's how reliable editors operate (the rename-over-file is an atomic
operation) to avoid any possibility of dataloss due to crashes etc.
Since the 1-4 rules are pretty much there for all unixes...
Maybe your solaris editor doesn't do editing in this way?
