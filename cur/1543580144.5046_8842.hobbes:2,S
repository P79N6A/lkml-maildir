Actually, this is not fine.  Check the code that says:
	if (minor >= MAX_MD_BOOT_DEVS) {
		printk ("md: Minor device number too high.\n");
		return 0;
	} else if (md_setup_args.set & (1 << minor)) {
		printk ("md: Warning - md=%d,... has been specified twice;\n"
			"    will discard the first definition.\n", minor);
	}
     ..........
	md_setup_args.set |= (1 << minor);
Note that "md_setup_args.set" is an unsigned long.
If minor >= 32, then we wont successfully set a bit in the set, and
things wont work right.
