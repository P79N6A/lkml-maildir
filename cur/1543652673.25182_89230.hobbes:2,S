I'm trying to figure out what is the subset of ioctl's a system needs to
run.  I figure the best way is sticking a printk in sys_ioctl, and
having it printk the number, so that syslog can pick it up, and then go
through the list.  This way I can use the system normally for a week to
collect the information I need.
Is there an easier way, or is there a way that I can make my life easier
(i.e. going from printk'd number to header file include).
thanks,
shaya potter
