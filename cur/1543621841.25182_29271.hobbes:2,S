Booting just normal with -rc2-ac1:
Directly after boot appears this messages again:
	init_special_inode: bogus imode (70141) 
I'd had to run e2fsck -f /dev/hda5 (/) on it:
	Entry 'par2' in /dev (8166) has deleted/unused inode 9337.
But former errors occured on other partitons as well (/dev/hda(5-8)).
The cable used:

	|<--16cm-->|<--------40cm-------->|
	+----------+----------------------+
    controller  WDC AC24300L          LTN301 CDROM
Booting with ide=nodma:
The corruption hasn't appeared yet.
I've also tried dd if=/dev/hda(1,5-8) of=/dev/null bs=4k without error-messages in the logs.
So I may switch back to -pre9-ac3 again and see if it happens with that kernel.
