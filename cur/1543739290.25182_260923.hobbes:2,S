"rss" is O(1), old "shared" is O(N). With N being a few terabytes of
data divided by PAGE_SIZE...
on any desktop machine you couldn't notice the difference, it only
matters on the high end.
But I believe Hugh's proposal will make everyone happy. Anything that we
stuff in statm must have O(1) complexity (or at least O(log(N)),
otherwise ps v will nearly stop running in the big boxes.
