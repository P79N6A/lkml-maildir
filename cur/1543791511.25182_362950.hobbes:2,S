A very odd combination:
- free_pages_check() ensures that neither PG_slab nor PG_dirty are set
- prep_new_page() complains that both PG_slab and PG_dirty are set
- AFAICS slab doesn't set PG_dirty, and noone except slab set PG_slab.
I don't understand how two wrong bits can end up in page->flags.
Dipankar, could you modify bad_page() and hexdump +-128 bytes? Perhaps 
someone overwrites random memory. Or change the value of PG_slab to 20 
and check if page->flags remains 0x90.
