No, my patch (plus Chris' modification) change request allocation
from an overloaded queue from semi random (timing dependant mixture
of LIFO and FIFO), to FIFO.
As Chris has shown, can cause a task to be starved for 2.7s (and
theoretically infinite) when it should be woken in < 200ms under
similar situations with the FIFO scheme.

Actually, there is no priority other than time (ie. FIFO), and
seek distance in the IO subsystem. I guess this is why your
arguments fall down ;)

In practice, the problems of having a memory size limited queue

If IO priorities were implemented, you still have the problem of
starvation. It would be better to simply have a per process limit
on request allocation, and implement the priority scheduling in
the io scheduler.
I think you would find that most processes do just fine with
just a couple of requests each, though.

No, they will be woken up one at a time as requests
become freed, and in FIFO order. It might be possible
for a higher (CPU) priority task to be woken up
before the previous has a chance to run, but this
scheme is no worse than before (the solution here is
per process request limits, but this is 2.4).
