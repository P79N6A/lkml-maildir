Do you mind doing a a quick grep:
    cd /path/to/your/kernel/source
    grep "Jari Ruusu" drivers/block/loop.c
If you see my name there, your kerneli.org cryptoapi enabled kernel is
running same loop code I wrote years ago. Those loop-jari-something patches
that you find on the net, are just copies of old loop-AES code.
