Hi all
I have a GE NIC card working in receive only mode capturing all traffic at
80Gbps in a 2-way SMP Pentium-III system.
I found very extrange that, for this device, stats on /proc/net/dev updates 
each second (more or less), that is, not in sub-second intervals. Again note
this only happens for this device and not for other NIC card (Fast-Ethernet 
card, e100).
I'm quite sure that the nic is receiving the traffic smootly, 
because interrupts are distributed smoothly in the time in /proc/interrupts
(I talk about sub second intervals here). Tthe GE card makes around 10000 
ints/second. 
Also I think packets are forwarded to the CPU smoothly (not in chunks each second)
because measurements of timestamps and RTT calculations I made.
I'm curious why just this device updates stats this way.
I'm running vanilla 2.4.20
Any comment will be greatly appreciated
Thanks in advance
