For example. My 8 years old EIZO F764M must not be powered down/powersaved
for more than few seconds, otherwise it takes about two days to get 
convergence back right (monitor "fixes" itself, it is just unusable until
it does so as there is about 0.5cm distance between red and green and
green and blue components...).

setterm -powersave powerdown. I used it until monitor told me that it was
bad idea.
