There has since been a some style cleanups and the raid5 refactor, but
you can go grab the 2.6.21-iop1 patch series from SourceForge if you
want to try these changes out.  Use the attached series file instead of
the one in the tarball.  
You can also wait for 2.6.22-iop1, which should be the final version of
md-accel queued for the merge window.
