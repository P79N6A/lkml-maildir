We can propagate it to secondary busses in pci_alloc_child_bus().
We inherit parent->ops and parent->sysdata at this point, we can also
inherit parent->whatever_flags_we_like.
Setting it from the quirk is a bit more yucky.  I *think* we're going
to have to walk the PCI tree, given that it's a FIXUP_FINAL.  Maybe it
needs to not be a FIXUP_FINAL ... a FIXUP_HEADER might get it set early
enough for it to propagate through that mechanism.
