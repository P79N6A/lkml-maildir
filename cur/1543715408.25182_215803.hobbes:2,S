You didn't bother to read the line above nor the fact that /proc
has NOTHING TO DO WITH A PROCESS.
If you don't want to share information amongst tasks, you simply
execute `umount /proc` as root. Then nobody except root can see
anything about any other task if the home directories of other
tasks are not world readable.
Each task then becomes isolated in its own little cocoon.
