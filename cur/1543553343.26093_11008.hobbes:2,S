Except likely it is hardware.. the plastic case :)

Compiling is very cpu intensive, so the system won't be doing many
idle calls (where cpu can cool down).  This sounds like your cpu is
having a heatstroke and shutting down instead of frying itself.
It may well be that 2.4 kernel is keeping the cpu busy more than 2.2
or windows does, and your box is poorly designed wrt heat disipation.
