Do not do it! You cannot control some very important features of IPX without
sysctl! Anyway below is patch, Alan please apply (although I must say that
this Makefile changed a bit my opinion on how obj-y and obj-m works...).
As for your other reports - No1 is fixed in Alan tree and patch is flying somewhere
around, and No2 looks like that your semaphore.h is corrupted. For parport
problems in No4, you have broken compiler or you changed some options in the
middle of compilation.
