Subject: another attempt to kill off linux/config.h

Every time I (or someone else) gets a patch included
removing explicit includes of linux/config.h, another few creep
into the tree a day or so later.
Lets kill them all for good.
master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davej/configh.git
is a git tree killing off all the current users in tree,
and adds a #warn to include/linux/config.h that it's going away.
(This should still leave as-yet-unmerged trees compiling,
 and hopefully get them fixed before they get merged)
We can then remove the file for real just before 2.6.19
