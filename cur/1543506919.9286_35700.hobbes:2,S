According to linux/Documentation/serial-console.txt, simple specify:
	'console=device,options'
(device=ttySx, options may include serial port speed, etc.)
e.g.:	'console=ttyS1,9600'
	-or-
	'console=ttyS1,9600 console=tty0' to use either serial or the
video card.
Of course, to enter this at the LILO prompt, LILO has to be installed with
the option to display on the serial port:
e.g.:	serial = 1,9600n8 (for ttyS1, 9600 baud)
so that you can specify this via the serial port; if not, then you would
need a keyboard/video card/monitor to set this :(
OTOH, similiar to your reference to Suns, FreeBSD's initial loader has an
option to probe the keyboard (-P)...if a keyboard is found, the video
card/keyboard is used; if not, the serial port is used.
