I am using 1006.  I have enabled MP 1.4 in order to get the IRQ
numbers 16 and beyond.  I am not sure how useful that is since several
PCI IRQs are shared and there are lots of free ones.  Anyhow, MP 1.1
works just fine too.  I am using the Athlon MP 1900+ CPUs.
Note to anyone who is considering this cpu/motherboard, this combo
uses *shedloads* of power.  400W is *not* enough (I've seen Alan post
to this effect before but it bears repeating).  Also, make sure you
have good case airflow -- all that power that is being consumed is
being turned into heat.  Aftermarket CPU heatsink and fan are a good
idea.  Unfortunately, it is a bit crowded for 80mm CPU fans though.
Things are stable now once I mitigated the heat death problem.
