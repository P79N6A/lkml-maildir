As Charles suggested, here are my .config files for my linux-2.4.20-8
(Redhat 9) and linux-2.6.0-test4 builds. CONFIG_FB_VESA is enabled for 2.6,
but vga=773 still does not work (and video=vga16:off is still needed, unlike
2.4). I am using a Dell Latitude C400 laptop, which uses an Intel i810 video
card, which only recently been supported by Redhat 9 and XFree86.
I've also tried Redhat's arjanv's linux-2.6 RPMs, which include the
following known problems for the AGP modules. The AGP problem definitely
affects my laptop because I just "modprobe intel-agp" before startx will
work. Could this same AGP problem be causing my vga=773 problems?
Known quirks
------------
* XFree86 vs AGP
  The kernel agp modules got split into per chipset modules; the auto-load
  mechanism of XFree86 in RHL9 isn't yet adjusted to this split. You can get
  it to work by hand by doing a "modprobe intel-agp" (if you have an intel
  chipset of course) before starting X.
