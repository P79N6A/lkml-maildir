Heh. I was wondering about that ...

Looks good. Might be useful to distinguish more carefully between the hot
and cold lists - what you've described is basically just the cold list.
The hot list is similar, except it's also used as a LIFO stack, so the
the most recently freed page is assumed to be cache-warm, and is reallocated
first. This reduces the overall number of cacheline misses in the system,
by reusing cachelines that are already present in that CPU's cache.
Moreover, the cold list tries to use pages that are NOT in another CPUs
cache. The main thing that allocates from the cold list is DMA operations,
and the main thing that populates it is page-reclaim. Other things are
generally assumed to be hot (this is one of the areas where more work
could probably be done ...)
