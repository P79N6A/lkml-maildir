Kitt,
The patch is a platform specific workaround that forces "pci=noacpi"
for this specific machine -- as if you supplied it on the cmdline.
The idea is to run the kernel w/o this patch and see
If we can fix the root cause, thus possibly helping other
systems which have the same problem.
If we fail to find/fix the root cause, or discover that
the platform has an issue that we simply can't fix
in the kernel, then it makes sense to add this automatic
workaround, but not before.
