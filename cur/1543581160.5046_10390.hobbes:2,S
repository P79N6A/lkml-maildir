Stephen already covered this point, the merging is not a problem
to deal with for read-ahead. The underlying system can easily
queue that in nice big chunks. Delayed allocation makes it
easier to to flush big chunks as well. I seem to recall the xfs people
having problems with the lack of merging causing a performance hit
on smaller I/O.
Of course merging doesn't have to happen in ll_rw_blk.
