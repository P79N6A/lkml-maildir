I like this as it moves the whole tracing code out of line.  It would
be nice if we could make blktrace a module with this, but we'd need
to change the interface away from an ioctl on the block device for that.
Btw, something that really shows here and what I noticed in my sputrace
aswell is that there is a lot of boilerplate code due to the varargs
trace handlers.  We really need some way to auto-generate the boilerplate
for the trace function to avoid coding this up everywhere.
