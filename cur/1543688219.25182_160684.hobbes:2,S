Do you mean in your case nothing shown on monitor (I've disabled monitor
blanking, so that is not it), sysrq key didn't work, nmi watchdog didn't
trigger but you were still able to get output from serial console? An oops?
Or, did you use kdb/kgdb in addition to serial console?

ACPI has never been enabled. I enabled local APIC when I enabled nmi
watchdog, so I've tried it on and off.

I don't have 2.2 output at hand, but the 2.4.21-jam1 output doesn't seem too
suspicious:
