Over the easter weekend I took some time for testing. One ide channel does
not work with dma enabled, which is bootup default. After about 30 seconds,
the channel is switched to pio and the machine running again.
Funny though: Before, I could not return from console blanking or reach the
machine through network. But as for any production system, I rather keep it
running than spend downtime seeking the error.
Thank you all.
