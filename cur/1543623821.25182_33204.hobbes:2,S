1) keep track of which pages we are reading ahead
   ... the readahead code already does this
2) at read() or fault time, see if the page
   (a) is resident
   (b) is in the current readahead window,
       ie. already read ahead
3) if the page is in the current readahead window
   but NOT resident, the page was read in and
   evicted before we got around to using it, so
   readahead window thrashing is going on
   ... in that case, collapse the size of the
   readahead window TCP-style
4) slowly growing the readahead window when there is
   enough memory available, in order to minimise the
   number of disk seeks
5) the growing in (3) and shrinking in (4) mean that
   the readahead size of all streaming IO in the system
   gets automatically balanced against each other and
   against other memory demand in the system
regards,
Rik
