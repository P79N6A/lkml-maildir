Subject: Forcibly remove broken disk from LV

I have a disk that only gives SCSI errors etc which
I want to remove from the VG. But vgreduce only hangs
and so does pvremove...
If I physically remove the disk, the vg/pv/lv etc isn't
accessible so the vgreduce won't work (claims that it
can't find any PV's etc).
So how do I remove the disk?
