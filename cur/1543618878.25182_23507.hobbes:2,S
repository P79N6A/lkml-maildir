I suppose you're talking about the Intel patch, not mine, which is
obviously out. I admit it was too complex.
The problem with the original code is that it combines reading the status
of the MTRR default register and disabling cache in a single step that
is performed simultaneously by all CPUs.
The patch from Intel inserts synchronization between these two steps,
thereby avoiding that the second CPU reads a "defaults status" that in
reality is the "cache disabled" status the first CPU had set before.
This suffices to fix the problem.
