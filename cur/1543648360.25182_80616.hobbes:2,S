Subject: How to allow caching of PCI addresses in user space?

I am currently working on a univ. project which
requires caching of data stored on a remote computer
and accessed via PCI address mmapping to userspace.
I have repeatdly failed to enable caching of these
addresses. 
The mmaping is done using remap_page_range.
I have tried various protection options without
success. 
Does this have to do with anything concerning the
MTRR's? 
How can I allow caching of PCI addresses accessed in
user space thorugh mmaping using remap_page_range?
Thanks,
Daniel Zinder
