It is rude, but they're writing proprietary modules, and *that* is
rude, so screw 'em.

Greg didn't say it was rude to write a new driver without consulting
the author of an existing driver.. just that taking their code without
asking them if they would prefer to put it in the tree themselves is a
bit rude.
Admittably there is a point where this whole politeness thing could
get out of hand, but I think a good rule of thumb is to ask the author
if they're ok with you doing X with their code, and if they say no,
well, try to be gracious about it.  Not that they *should* say no,
this *is* free software after all.
