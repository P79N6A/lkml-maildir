Hi,
I'm running a PIII system and now when it reaches "Power down." in it's
shutdown sequence the machine doesn't shut off like it did under 2.4.
I'm not sure what info would be useful in finding out the cause so just
ask me. Or maybe I'm just screwing option up, which isn't entirely
unheard of... ;)
Thanks for your help,
Harold
