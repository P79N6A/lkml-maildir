Since 2.2.16 it has been functional in the 2.2 kernels
as well.

Sure, I have some code. The most interesting is probably
the cdrwtool just mentioned in this thread. I've been
thinking about doing a cdrecord "transport" using the
CDROM_SEND_PACKET stuff just for the fun of it, if it
worked well enough that would eliminate the need for ide-scsi
on ATAPI burners completely.
