Subject: [PATCH] Fix RELOC_HIDE miscompilation

[resend due to mailer problems]
RELOC_HIDE got miscompiled on gcc3.1/x86-64 in the access to softirq.c's per 
cpu variables.  This patch fixes the problem.
Clearly to hide the relocation the addition needs to be done after the 
value obfuscation, not before.
I don't know if it triggers on other architectures (x86-64 is especially 
stressf here because it has negative kernel addresses), but seems like the 
right thing to do.
Also does the arithmetic in unsigned long to avoid undue assumptions of the 
comp for pointers.
