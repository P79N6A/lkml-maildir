Btw, on another tangent - Andrew Morton reports that APM is unhappy about
the fact that the fast system call stuff required us to move the segments
around a bit. That's probably because the APM code has the old APM segment
numbers hardcoded somewhere, but I don't see where (I certainly knew about
the segment number issue, and tried to update the cases I saw).
Debugging help would be appreciated, especially from somebody who knows
the APM code.
