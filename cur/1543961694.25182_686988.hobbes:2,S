Hi all,
Today's linux-next build (powerpc ppc64_defconfig) fails like this:
fs/xfs/xfs_ialloc.c: In function 'xfs_ialloc_ag_alloc':
fs/xfs/xfs_ialloc.c:301: error: implicit declaration of function 'random32'
I added
#include <linux/random.h>
after the other includes in fs/xfs/xfs_ialloc.c, but there is probably a
better fix.
The commit that seems to have caused this
6309a0720469beb77e0ab75f403a98a0aba4140c ("XFS] Don't initialise new
inode generation numbers to zero") in the xfs tree that I have seems to
have just gone into Linus' tree as commit
359346a9655c8800408ed3ca44517ac7ea95c197.
