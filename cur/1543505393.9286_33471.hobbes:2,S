Hi,
    I've just received a cd which is written in the standard iso9660
format. However the stupid author, wrote some of the file names (in his
html) in upper case and some in lower case. Since the majority are in
upper case and since linux seems to mount the device by default so that
files appear in lower case, I must ask - how do I mount a cdrom such
that all files appear as upper case rather than lower case. Thanks. (The
CD has 1000s of small files which are linked to so it isn't realistic to
fix by hand - there must be an easier way anyway.... Thanks again.
Oh, one more while I'm here, I tried putting an rc6 ext2fs on a cd but
it simply refuses to mount (yes I did create the image correctly and
pass mount the right options). Any ideas? - I'm also waiting for the li
patch for 2.2.11
Jon.
