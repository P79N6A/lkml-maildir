Ah, Martin, thanks for sending the patch. I think I saw the voodoo in your
patch. When I did that last time I did _not_ do this:
+                       if (PageReferenced(page)) {
+                               del_page_from_inactive_list(page);
+                               add_page_to_active_list(page);
+                       } 
+                       continue;
This may shorten your inactive list through consecutive runs.
And there is another difference here:
+       if (max_mapped <= 0 && nr_pages > 0)
+               swap_out(priority, gfp_mask, classzone);
+
It sounds reasonable _not_ to swap in case of success (nr_pages == 0).
To me this looks pretty interesting. Is something like this already in -aa?
This patch may be worth applying in 2.4. It is small and looks like the right
thing to do.
Regards,
Stephan
