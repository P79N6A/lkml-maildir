Basically:
tmpfs size < ram size + swap size
now, lets say a fair bit of your ram dies. you can't repolace it but the
box will manage to run with your new ram size. if the tmpfs size is
static then you get
tmpfs size > new ram size + swap size
and so any process can fill up your ram+swap by writing to tmpfs when
you use tmpfs for /tmp.
By having the tmpfs size be a function of your ram size (as it is by
default at 50%) you wont get that. Currently my tmpfs size is 63%. If
half my ram dies I can still happily use my laptop without any fiddling
because its new size will by 63% of the new ram size (so it'll be around
80MB rather then 160MB). Now, it does mean my /tmp is smaller but
everything is still functional and it's bigger then my root partition,
which I'd rather nto be actively writing to and only has 20MB free by
design.
