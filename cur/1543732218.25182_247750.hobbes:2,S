 - the writeable queue_depth sysfs attr is fine,
 - the reverse_scan option is vetoed because it can't be supported when
   the driver will be converted to the pci_driver interface (soon)
 - I'm not so sure about the module parameter, what's the problem of beeing
   able to only change the queue depth once sysfs is mounted?
