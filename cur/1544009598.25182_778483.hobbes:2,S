I don't understand this comment.  This interface is only used when
getting the FH for an already allocated inode.  hfsplus_iget is what
all other operations use in hfsplus, so it seems fine.  hfs experts
might chime in that something else might be needed due to the strange
ways links work in hfs, but from the VFS POW it seems fine.

hfsplus never updates i_generation, so this check is superflous.  Brad,
Roman: is there something that can help to guard against inode number
reuse on HFS/HFSplus?

You _do_ need a get_parent, otherwise access will magically fail once
any directory inode in a path is out of the cache.  This can be
trivially reproduced by unexporting and unmounting a filesystem while
a client has a cwd deep inside the exported filesystem.
And otherwise I don't think this comment is helpful in the code,
fh_to_parent / fh_To_dentry and get_parent is what most simpler
filesystems have.
