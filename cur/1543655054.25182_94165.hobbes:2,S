So just let SOFTWARE_SUSPEND depend on ACPI_SLEEP, if ACPI_SLEEP is 
independent it doesn't has to depend on SUSPEND.
Another possibility is that you might want to restore the old behaviour, 
that SOFTWARE_SUSPEND is always visible and forces ACPI_SLEEP to y if 
needed, but then you have to explicitly disable the user prompt and 
SOFTWARE_SUSPEND must not depend on ACPI_SLEEP:
config ACPI_SLEEP
	bool "Sleep States" if !SOFTWARE_SUSPEND
	default SOFTWARE_SUSPEND
config SOFTWARE_SUSPEND
	bool "Software Suspend (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && PM
bye, Roman
