Hi guys,
Does some kind soul have an exclude file for being able to run
diff -urN -X exclude_file linux linux-patched > my.patch 2>&1
i.e. I can put patterns like "*.o" ".config" etc etc but it will take time
to find them all out.
This would allow making patches from the compiled patched tree without
having to do "make mrproper" each time.
Regards,
