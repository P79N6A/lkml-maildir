In upcoming kernels, changer support will work equally well
with ATAPI, SCSI and IDE-SCSI so that should not be an issue. ide-cd
contains work arounds for faulty hardware that you will miss. I
think the best solution would be a setup with both ide-scsi
and ide-cd, running ordinary drives with ide-cd and cd-r/w
with ide-scsi.
