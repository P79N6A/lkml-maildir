It's possible to divorce PAGE_SIZE from the binary formats, though I
found it difficult to keep up with the update treadmill. Maybe it's
like hch says and I just needed to find more and better API cleanups.
I've only not tried to resurrect it because it's too much for me to do
on my own. I essentially collapsed under the weight of it and my 2.5.x
codebase ended up worse than Katrina as a disaster, which I don't want
to repeat and think collaborators or a different project lead from
myself are needed to avoid that happening again.
It's unclear how much the situation has changed since 32-bit workload
feasibility issues have been relegated to ignorable or deliberate
"f**k 32-bit" status. The effect is doubtless to make it easier, though
to what degree I'm not sure.
Anyway, if that's being kicked around as an alternative, it could be
said that I have some insight into the issues surrounding it.
