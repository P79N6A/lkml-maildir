Yes.
In a lot of ways if you access /proc/self and you get back information
that does not correspond to yourself the result is nonsense.  Which
is a fairly mighty problem.
I'm still trying to understand which will break user space more,
adding /proc/task or changing /proc/self.

The name sounds good to me.
I am not certain the two components make sense as we have a possible
permission problem where it is remotely possible that a task will
have permission to access /proc/<tid> but not /proc/<tgid>.
We certainly need to think through that case before making it
to a stable kernel.
The reason I care is that we need to fix /proc/mounts.  So once we
have /proc/task we can also have change /proc/mounts to
be a symlink to /proc/task/mounts. 
Once we get the /proc/mounts thing sorted out.  There are several
other entries in /proc that need to that need to follow in it's wake
as they also become per namespace.  /proc/net and /proc/sysvipc for
starters.
