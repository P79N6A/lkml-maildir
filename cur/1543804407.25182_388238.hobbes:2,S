I agree. I think you should try with simplified version again.
Then, we can discuss.

IMHO, I don't like automatic runtime tuning, you say 'flexible' here.
I think flexibility allows 2^(MAX_ORDER - 1) size fragmentaion.
When SECTION_SIZE > MAX_ORDER, this is terrible.
I love certainty that sysadmin can grap his system at boot-time.
And, for people who want to remove range of memory, list-based approach will
need some other hook and its flexibility is of no use.
(If list-based approach goes, I or someone will do.)
I know zone->zone_start_pfn can be removed very easily.
This means there is possiblity to reconfigure zone on demand and
zone-based approach can be a bit more fliexible.
