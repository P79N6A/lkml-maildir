Yes.  And my bug for not noticing your s_time_gran patch to the others.

The file is shamefully big, yes.  I'd hate to move the swap entry
part of it out of mm/, but it might be a possibility to divide it up:
the filesystem entry points in fs/, the use of swap in mm/ - be nice
if all that could be under obj-$(CONFIG_SWAP) in the Makefile.
I did once embark on looking at it from a CONFIG_SWAP point of view;
but didn't get far before more urgent work intervened.  And your
argument grows weaker, with filesystems spreading through drivers,
and even to arch (spufs).
