     Are there any cases where a system does not have E820 but has a
     broken E801?   And in that case, is there any safe way to deal
     with it?  If you're assuming that E801 is only broken when AX
     >15mb, you'll get bitten when your 12mb machine cheerfully E801's
     back 14.5mb in AX -- As someone who spent a few months sorting
     threw bizarre E820 errors, I'll say that it's a lot better to gets
     lots of "this machine isn't correctly reporting memory" than it is
     to get one or two "this machine isn't correctly reporting memory"
     while other machines of that type cheerfully work.
