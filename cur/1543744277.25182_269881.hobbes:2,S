How about we define cpu-distance to be "relative distance to the
lowest level cache on another CPU". On a system that has nodes with
multiple sockets (each supporting multiple cores or HT "CPUs" sharing
some level of cache), when the scheduler needs to migrate a task it would
first choose a CPU sharing the same cache, then a CPU on the same node,
then an off-node CPU (i.e. falling back to node distance).
Of course, I have no idea if that's anything like an optimal or desirable
task migration policy. Probably depends on cache-trashiness of the task
being migrated.
