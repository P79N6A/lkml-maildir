Was your stress test using threads (or other nonstandard clone() calls)?

Did you find the exact instruction which faulted, and the place in
dup_fd() C code which it corresponds to?  Was the oops due to a NULL
dereference or an invalid pointer?

I don't see immediately how the wrong open_files value could cause an
oops in this function.  If the stale open_files value was too big (some
files were closed while we dropped the lock), it should still be safe
(AFAIK file tables can only grow, but never shrink, so access to entries
which were valid before should not access invalid memory).  If the stale
open_files value was too small (some more files were opened), the copy
would miss some files, which should be OK (except that memcpy() calls
which copy fd_sets will copy bits for some of that missed files which
happened to be in the last word - this would cause some fd's to be
permanently busy, and potentially could cause problems later, but an
oops in dup_fd() due to this problem does not look likely).  Seeing the
exact place in the code which oopsed would be interesting.
However, the new code does not look safe in all cases.  If some other
task has opened more files while dup_fd() released oldf->file_lock, the
new code will update open_files to the new larger value.  But newf was
allocated with the old smaller value of open_files, therefore subsequent
accesses to newf may try to write into unallocated memory.
Hmm, and actually the patch seems to be wrong for yet another reason -
the old_fdt pointer which you pass to count_open_files() may be stale
(the comment above even warns about that, and the following line updates
old_fdt).  The count_open_files() call must be after the "old_fdt =
files_fdtable(oldf)" line.
