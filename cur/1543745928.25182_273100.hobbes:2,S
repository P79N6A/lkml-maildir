I see your concern. There are some more changes neccecary to make this
reliably work. I'm not sure if it can be done without really big
changes. I will look a bit deeper into this.

Yeah, I observed this too and therefor came up with the whom to kill and
reentrancy patch.

As I said before the random behaviour was _not_ introduced in -rc2. It
might have changed in -rc2. The random kill with overkill can also be
triggered in 2.6.7 and 2.6.8. I have not tried elder versions though.
