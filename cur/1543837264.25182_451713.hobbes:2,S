Ah, OK.  And not to forget select/poll.  (What about SIGHUP?)
I'm not sure though, whether it's really necessary to allow the
owner of a file to revoke fds - I would feel better if only root
(or someone with the right caps) could revoke fds/mappings.

With the EIO/EOF behaviour that's not a problem - apps that deal
with ttys have to expect that condition.

Hmm... which apps have an open fd on block devices?  Usually a
filesystem is mounted on the device and then there are no fds
to the block-dev involved.  Or do you expect the "fuser -m"
behaviour from revoke?  Afaics, that's not the case at the moment.
Which users have perms to access a block-dev anyway?

Hmm... then use fuser and kill the process instead of silently taking
away fds and mappings.
My summary: revoke on chars devs with EIO/EOF behaviour is ok.
            revoke on blocks devs is questionable
            revoke on regular files is wrong.
Ciao, ET.
