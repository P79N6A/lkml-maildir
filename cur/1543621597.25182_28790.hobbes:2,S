Sorry that was a simplified explanation above.  If you examine the
patch you'll see that it can only change the time by < 1 jiffy (10ms).
However this is the interval wrongly estimated by the CPU's timer
(because the laptop's clock rate is not what the kernel thinks it is).
Ie, shouldn't be a problem.
