One can't assume that 'cld' is not required because a user can
execute 'std'. Such a user, calling a kernel function in its
context, could really make a mess by executing 'std' before.
You definitely need a 'cld' inside any copy_to/from_user code.
memmove(), can copy overlapping buffers. It does this by
copying backwards when necessary. If it uses ix86 string
primatives, it executes 'std' for the backwards repeat counts.
