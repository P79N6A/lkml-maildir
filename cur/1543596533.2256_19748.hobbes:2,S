It's happened again.  The server which previously failed with memory
errors, has failed again and required a reboot.  It was using 26% swap,
and apache would fail to start with 'semget: No space left on device'. 
What we also noticed was that the kswapd process showed 'defunct' on
ps...  mean anything to anyone?
