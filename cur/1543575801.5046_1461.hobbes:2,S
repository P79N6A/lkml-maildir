Bad news: the old problem with lockups during insmoding parport is back! I
recompiled 2.2.18, because there is a problem with the 8138too-driver vs. 
modutils-2.3.22. Since then, the old problem was back! Unfortunately I
did not save the old modules. So, for the moment I cannot use 2.2.18 at
all and I have switched to the 2.4 series and modutils-2.3.14 (version of
modprobe doesn´t matter for the lockups, however). 
Any hint is welcome, for I would prefer a really stable kernel for this
machine.
