I can't follow you on SYNCHRONIZE CACHE.
The only command written to the syslog in the errors where
0x60==ATA_CMD_FPDMA_READ and 0xB0 (which is not in
include/linux/ata.h, but ATA-6 says that this is SMART related. That
makes sense, as smartd is failing).

But that still seems correct, as I would not expect that SMART
commands get queued. (Thats just a guess, as I did not try to find the
code that does this distinction)

Comparing sata_nv.c from 2.6.23-rc8-mm1 and 2.6.23-mm1 I see two
changes, that look suspicious:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/libata-dev.git;a=commitdiff;h=31cc23b34913bc173680bdc87af79e551bf8cc0d
The comment says: "ahci and sata_sil24 are converted to use ata_std_qc_defer()."
But the patch also adds ".qc_defer = ata_std_qc_defer," to sata_nv.c
The second change is the removal of the 'lock' spinlock from sata_nv.c
that was used in nv_swncq_qc_issue and nv_swncq_host_interrupt.
Should I try to revert one or both of these changes?
