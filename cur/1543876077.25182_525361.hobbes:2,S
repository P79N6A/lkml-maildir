... yet not all CPU's *have* an FSB. Notably AMD ones do not, and I'm
sure you've read on a lot of online tech magazines that other vendors
may also not have one in the future  :-)
Exposing a concept that we KNOW does not make sense via a kernel
interface (which means we need to keep it around forever) is in my
opinion quite a bad mistake to make.... Please lets not do this.
