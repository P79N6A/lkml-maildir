1. having patches inline in messages instead of as attachments make
initial viewing of the patches much easier - no need to open a
sepperate attachment just to review a patch.
2. Commenting on patches is a lot easier when you can just reply to
the message and have the patch quoted inline and then add your
comments.
3. saving patches for application is easy when you can just save the
email message with the patch inline - then you have the explanation of
the patch and the patch itself nicely contained in a single file (and
patch will conveniently strip the extra text before the patch-proper
when you apply it).
4. You don't need an account that's able to add 'binary data' -
patches should preferable be in 7-bit ASCII text form, not 8-bit.
And if your current MUA doesn't allow you to add text files inline,
then there are several that do - mutt, pine & kmail come to mind and
there are several others.

I'm currious - in what situations are you prevented from sending
patches inline in emails??
