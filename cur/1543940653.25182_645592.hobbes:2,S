Yes, is with DMA disabled

I explain it bad:
- with spin_lock the system seems, there is no problem with Valuntary 
Preeption and
Preemptible Kernel
- with full preemption  it runs but the serial line can't be used for 
receiving at
high bit rate (using lrz)

In the complete preemption yes.

I just change it because I have corruption on receiving buffer. All
my test are done with this fix

I just test it I don't have
buffer overflow.
I protect with a spinlock the access to the register when we sending
from the tasklet. It is correct?

Ok
