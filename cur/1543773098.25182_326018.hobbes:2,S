Subject: why does fsync() on a tmpfs directory give EINVAL?

The man page for fsync() suggests that it is necessary to call it on the 
directory fd.
However, in the case of tmpfs, fsync() on the file completes, but on the 
directory it returns -1 with errno==EINVAL.
Is there any particular reason for this?  Would a patch that makes it 
just return successfully without doing anything be accepted?
