From a quick peek at eepro100:
Is wait_for_cmd_done() racy?  It is called from hard_start_xmit()
outside the spinlock as well as from get_stats().  set_multicast_list()
also.
mdio_read() is called from various unprotected contexts, one of which is
a bh. Confident about this?
mdio_read() and write() use a self-timed timeout which will get 30%
shorter each year (Moore's law should be repealed).
tx_timeout() appears to be unprotected from the ISR.
Then there's this magical construct which also appears in 3c59x's ioctl:
    switch(cmd) {
        case SIOCDEVPRIVATE:            /* Get the address of the PHY in
use. */
                data[0] = phy;
        case SIOCDEVPRIVATE+1:          /* Read the specified MII
register. */
                saved_acpi = pci_set_power_state (sp->pdev, 0);
                data[3] = mdio_read (ioaddr, data[0], data[1]);
This makes my brain hurt.  data[0] is an output, data[1] is an input,
data[2] is unused, data[3] is an output.
Is this right?
