And this case isn't too bad either - it's no worse than the current
situation of not having a destination list.

I disagree, still. The d{addr,port} lookup in __ip_masq_in_get() 
should find it quickly without having "special case" keying; this
strikes me as an unnecessary complication.

Why would it hurt other entries? I think it's a win regardless.
I think you're trying to trade clarity and flexibility for memory
footprint. I'd rather see the following lists:
  s{addr,port}
  d{addr,port}
  m{addr,port}
  s+d{addr,port}
  m+d{addr,port}
...and no "special case" keying. For NO_D* | F_DLOOSE ip_masq_hash() 
could simply *not hash* the entry into the destination lists. This
means 10 pointers per ms (each being a doubly-linked list), and two or
five hash operations in ip_masq_hash() depending on the flags. Is this
too expensive?

  So, we should not be surprised to find that modern electronic
