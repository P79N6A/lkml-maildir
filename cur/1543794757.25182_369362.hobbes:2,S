In the US you can't sue to force their hardware open until they are a
proven monopoly. And as long as we have both Nvidia and ATI splitting
the market we won't get a monopoly.
So the choices are:
1) Live in 1998. What happens in five years R200's are no longer
available, fallback to VGA?
2) Temporarily accept the ugly drivers. Let desktop development
continue. Work hard on getting the vendors to see the light and go
open source.
3) Use Linux on the server and run Mac or Windows on your desktop.
The choice's aren't exclusive, you can do all three if you want. The
catch is the part about advancing the Linux desktop, that can't happen
without access to current and new video hardware.
