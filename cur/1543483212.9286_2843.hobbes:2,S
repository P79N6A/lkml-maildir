These new functions allow a kernel hacker to use semaphores without
recursion, so you'll be allowed to use again something like this:
data_ready()
{
	up_norecurse(&sem)
}
engine()
{
	sem = MUTEX_LOCKED_NORECURSE;
	while (need_data)
	{
		down_interruptible_norecurse(&sem);
		do_something()
	}
}
NOTE: The norecursive functions are _not_ thought to be used mixed with
the recursive ones and I am not going to think at what can happen doing
that ;). 
Here the patch against 2.2.1:

Note we could also avoid some asm instruction in norecursive semaphores,
but I don't think it's worth since the recursive semaphores are likely to
be so used that I think it's very probabile that your CPU get the function
__down (see kernel/sched.c) just from the cache. And left
waking_non_zero() untouched made more fun to implement no-recusive
semaphores ;)).
NOTE: the patch is completly untested, but make sense to me (even if
really I had not a lot of time to think about its correcness.. ;)
BTW, MUTEX_LOCKED used with recursive semaphores (2.2.1) is not likely to
make a lot of sense (to me at least) and the code that is using it should
be probably reviewed (e.g. ide_do_drive_cmd(), ide_end_drive_cmd()). Code
that is using MUTEX_LOCKED is likely to want to be converted to
norecursive semaphores. Personally I would remove MUTEX_LOCKED and I would
left only MUTEX, MUTEX_NORECURSE and MUTEX_LOCKED_NORECURSE... I'll do
that here soon but I am not going to post my future changes on the list
even if I am worried by such _potential_ bogus semaphores usages.
NOTE: In many cases we may want to convert a not-recursive semaphore to a
add_wait_queue() loop because is more efficient then a down_norecursive()
and is the right structure to not miss irq handler and at the same time
not cli() the CPU (see Ingo's email for more details), but I see at least
a clean usage of no-recursive semaphores, that could be to take care of
_how_many_ interrupts happened in the meantime. You can handle the same
with a separate volatile counter of course, but a norecursive semaphore
would produce simpler code for sure.
I hope that the patch will work fine ;). If somebody will play with it
please feedback. Thanks.
