We have the patches applied in ofed 1.2.c with default module parameter set to
caching disabled (ofed 1.2 had a different version of the patches, but caching
is disabled by default there, too). At least in this configuration
(caching disabled), all issues I've seen seem to be fixed now, and tests seem to
be running smoothly.
So I think it's safe to merge it up if the module parameter
is set to cache disabled by default.
No idea what happens if it's enabled though :)
