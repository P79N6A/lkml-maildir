Hi
Could you please apply this patch to 2.4. It fixes a very annoying problem
with logitech wireless keyboard/mouse combinations. Every time a 
mouse button is pressed the message 
keyboard.c: can't emulate rawmode for keycode 272
appears on the console, which is somewhat annoying especially if you want
to use gpm. For 2.5 this has been fixed by the patch in
http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/linux/linux-kernel/2003-06/0754.html,
Here's a similar patch for 2.4, which fixes the problem for me.
