It is absolutely lame that people in 2.5 are clueless to what is going to
need to be supported.  Also it is lame in 2.4 that cruft from OEMs who do
not get Linux, but their changes are accepted.  There were very careful
decisions made over the past 4-5 years about device ordering and
protecting the power of ide0/ide1.  Within a few days it is shot to hell
because nobody ever thinks to look at what was there before them.  They
all know better, are wiser, empower w/ megalmania (sp) and gawd knows what
else.  Please next time, do your homework before you attempt to call me
on these issues.  Do the two word "Native" and "Compatablity" in ATA-ATAPI
have meaning?  This will help you go a long way.
