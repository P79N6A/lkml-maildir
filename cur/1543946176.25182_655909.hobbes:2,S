Hi,
I'm mostly reading documentation and Kconfig/Makefiles...

Oops, bad struct name "pps_source_info_s".  What's that trailing _s
doing there?  We already know that it's a struct, so it must be
something else.  :)
We don't add such trailing (or leading) type/struct indicators in Linux.

Drop "an".

s/an/a/
"high time reference":  maybe a "high-resolution time reference"?
or "high-precision time reference"?
Just having "high time reference" is missing something...

Did you add any line(s) to Documentation/ioctl-number.txt ?
If not, please do so.
