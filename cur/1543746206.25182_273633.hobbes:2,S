I stand corrected.  ACPI wasn't widely deployed until 1998, so I expect
everything at that time was APM.  grepping my logs for more modern
systems, I see APM still in many of the laptops, about half the
desktops, and none of the servers -- YMMV.

yup, this is common on some hardware.
Frankly, I don't know if it is something to be concerned about if you
don't see it that much, but if the hardware loses interrupts when the
IOAPIC is enabled, then disabling it is a reasonable workaround.

You'll get C1 even without ACPI, so ACPI processor driver doesn't give
you any additional power savings c-states on this hardware.

maybe Dave can determine if there is a governor that can help you.
