well, it existed, and i can add it back - i dont have any strong feelings
either.

in those cases the 'irq overload' code should not trigger. It's not the
rate of interrupts that matters, it's the amount of time we spend in irq
contexts. The code counts the number of times we 'interrupt and interrupt
context'. Interrupting an irq-context is a sign of irq overload. The code
goes into 'overload mode' (and disables that particular interrupt source
for the rest of the current timer tick) only if more than 97% of all
interrupts from that source 'interrupt and irq context'. (ie. irq load is
really high.) As any statistical method it has some inaccuracy, but
'statistically' it gets things right.
