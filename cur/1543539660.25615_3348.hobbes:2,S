I have a small network out here, behind a masquerading firewall.
My firewall gets kicked out by my provider once a day, and gets
assigned a new IP address. the link is back up in about 30 seconds.
All my machines run NTP.

As you can see, I just did some testing from the ".1" machine which is
correctly masqueraded with the outgoing IP address of today (C3...),
but the .1 and .2 machines both have entries indicating that they are
trying to contact outside servers with the D4.... IP address that I
probably had a few days ago.
It seems as if the masq table entry has an IP address entry. Shouldn't
this be a reference to "the IP addr of that interface"? Thus when the
interface goes down and comes back up, the new addr is used?
Currently every xxx seconds the person now logged in on D4404C1A will
get a reply to my ntp query.....
(it is wrong to take the masq entry down with the interface: Then
people with fixed-ip will see their masqed connections go down, over a
power-cycle of their modem)
If you network guys can think of a valid reason why a masq-ed
connection may need to persist with an invalid IP address, then I'd
also accept a solution where I'd be able to nuke the offending 
masq entries in my IP-up script.
