Wait a second, forget all of this cache alignment crap.  If we can
avoid drivers seeing it, we should by all means necessary.
We should just tell people to use PCI pools and be done with it.  That
way all the complexity about buffer alignment and all this other
crapola lives strictly inside of the PCI pool code.
