That is the sticking point.  The MBR can NOT contain whatever values we 
want.  It must contain the values that the bios expects, otherwise boot 
loaders that use those values will fail to operate correctly.

dosemu emulates the bios and talks to the disk via the kernel, so it 
does not care what the real bios geometry is, or even if there IS a real 
bios geometry.  You can run dosemu on any block device, including a loop 
device, which clearly has no geometry.  It can choose whatever geometry 
it wants to emulate, though it should probably use whatever existing 
geometry is in the MBR of the disk ( physical or virtual ) that you are 
having it use.

The boot loaders get it from the MBR if they are not operating in LBA 
mode.  The partitioners put the geometry in the MBR.  The geometry that 
they place there must match the values expected by the bios.  If the 
kernel does not know those values, then it should not lie to the 
partitioning tools about it, it should fail the request, and let the 
partitioning tool decide what to do.

Right, the kernel can keep the old interface and rely on yet another 
user space tool to tell the kernel what it should report, or it can drop 
it and rely on the partitioners to deal with it.

You said already that as of 2.6 the kernel no longer knows the bios 
values, so the driver NEVER knows the right value to return.  Since that 
is the case, it should not pretend that it does know, it should let the 
user space partitioning tools know it does not know.  Yes, they may need 
modified to handle that case, but that is something they should have 
been doing a long time ago, and why complicate the kernel when this is 
really done in user space anyhow?
