Enclosed patches is tested and works on UP wo ramdisk.
It was in -mm until Andrew dropped it due to it causing
problems on SMP, NUMA and with ramdisk.
Ramdisk expects to be at the end of lowmem zone so it
wont work in it's current implementation with this patch
when memory is shiften into highmem zone.
I'll be looking into fixes when less busy.
