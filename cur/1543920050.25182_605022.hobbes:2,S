Provocation is often in the eye of the beholder, and basic manners
should be observed nevertheless.

No, he couldn't have. He quite obviously didn't even know enough
to understand his boot environment might be at fault, and hence
was unable to conceive the question you're demanding from him.

It may have appeared like that from the highly antagonistic mindset
that seems so prevalent in LKML. But if one just stepped back and
took a breath before answering it should have been quite obvious
that he wasn't. (out for a fight, that is)
Granted, it can be difficult to comprehend the point of view of
someone who does not know or understand something you yourself know
or understand well. But you should at least be aware of that
inability, and consequently refrain from accusing of provocation
where there may be none. Hanlon's razor, cynical as it may sound at
first, is an eminently humanistic principle.
