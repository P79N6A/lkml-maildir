OK, the core of my objection to this is that at the moment there's no
entangling of the bio layer and the DMA layer.  The bio layer works with
a nice finite list of generic or per-queue constraints; it doesn't care
currently what the underlying device or IOMMU does.  Putting such a
callback in would add this entanglement.
It could be that the bio people will be OK with this, and I'm just
worrying about nothing, but in that case, they need to say so...
