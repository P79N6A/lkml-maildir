Why do you use ramfs? Most of it is duplicated in tmpfs and ramfs is a
minimal _example_ fs. There was some agreement that this should stay
so.
Look into mm/shmem.c and look how little is added by CONFIG_TMPFS and
how much is duplicated from ramfs
If we really think the added swap vector per file in tmpfs is a major
overhead we should add the nonswapping functions there.
