Which brings me back to my initial reaction to this work. Do we need
two flavors of Mutex? some program sections need Fairness, some need
performance. Some need low-latency, some need absolute raw CPU power.
Because at the end of the day spinning in a saturated CPU work-load
that does not care about latency, eats away cycles that could be spent
on computation. Think multi-threaded video processing for example. 
Thing I would like to measure is 
1 - how many times we spin and at the end get a lock
2 - how many times we spin and at the end sleep.
3 - how many times we sleep like before.
vs. In old case CPU spent on scheduling. Just to see if we are actually loosing
cycles at the end.
