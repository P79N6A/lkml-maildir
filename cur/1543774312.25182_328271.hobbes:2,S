After some thought, I'm inclined to think that the patch below is
the right one.  It unconditionally saves and restores the PCI config
registers when pci_enable_device is called.  Although this is often
(usually?) unnecessary, it seems like a safe thing to do and it should
not be a performance-sensitive path.  The code to check for whether
or not this is necessary would be a little harder to read IMHO,
so I think this is warranted.
The comment block at the head of pci_enable_device says "Initialize
device before it's used by a driver" which implies that saving and
restoring the PCI config should be safe if the function is used
as intended.  Out of ~318 files referencing pci_enable_device, ~47
of them (~15%) of them are actually calling pci_enable_device from
multiple places.  Most of these that I've looked at so far are calling
it from ->resume as well as ->probe.  A few drivers seem to call
pci_enable_device from one of several branches within the same if
statement inside the ->probe function, but I figure thoese examples
are equivalent to just calling it from a single place.
Is calling pci_enable_device from ->resume really proper?  If not,
what should those devices be doing?  I'll be happy to take a glance
at all the drivers calling pci_enable_device multiple times if there
is general agreement that the approach below would be acceptable.
What do you all think?

P.S.  Below is the one-liner I used to determine who is accessing
pci_enable_device.  It probably misses a few strays...
# Generate list of calls to pci_enable_device
find . -type f -name '*.c' -exec \
	grep -H pci_enable_device[[:space:]]*\(.*\).*[\;\)] {} \; | \
	cut -f1 -d: | sort | uniq -c
