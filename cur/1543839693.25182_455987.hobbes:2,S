Subject: [PATCH][RFC] x86_64: Reload CS when startup_64 is used.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

x86_64: Reload CS when startup_64 is used.
The current x86_64 startup code never reloads CS during the early boot process
if the 64-bit function startup_64 is used as entry point. The 32-bit entry 
point startup_32 does the right thing and reloads CS, and this is what most 
people are using if they use bzImage.
This patch fixes the case when the Linux kernel is booted into using kexec
under Xen. The Xen hypervisor is using large CS values which makes the x86_64
kernel fail - but only if vmlinux is booted, bzImage works well because it
is using the 32-bit entry point.
The main question is if we require that the boot loader should setup CS
to some certain offset to be able to boot the kernel. The sane solution IMO
should be that the kernel requires that the loaded descriptors are correct, 
but that the exact offset within the GDT the boot loader is using should not 
matter. This is the way the i386 boot works if I understand things correctly.
