But if the EXPORT_SYMBOL() is in sound_firmware doesn't it just say that
sound_firmware uses mod_firmware_load? And that's no need for ld to use
that object file, or is there some magic in the
__attribute__((section("..."))) part that I don't understand?
% nm sound.a | less
...
sound_firmware.o:
00000000 ? __kstrtab_mod_firmware_load
00000000 ? __ksymtab_mod_firmware_load	<- from EXPORT_SYMBOL()
00000000 t do_mod_firmware_load
00000000 b errno
00000000 t gcc2_compiled.
00000150 T mod_firmware_load
...
Moving the EXPORT_SYMBOL() to sound_core makes the symbols appear in
vmlinux, since sound_core.o gets a U mod_firmware_load. Again, I haven't
tried booting with these kernels but the symbols are there.
