This is rapidly becoming off topic, especially for the kernel dev list, which is why I originally just posted the following info to the cc'ed people, but since it might be of interest, I'm posting it to the lists:
Sony GY-8240-DTF2 tape drive, picture of it, with some info here:
http://www.tomtec.co.jp/english/tape_hisped.html
this uses similar technology to that which is used in their Digital Betacam(tm) studio VCRs, and stores 200 Gigs uncompressed on one large tape, (60 on a small tape).
Data rate, 24 MB/s.
You've got to have a lot of data for that to be insufficient, and it would be my backup system of choice, if I needed the capcity, (I currently use punched Myler tape :-) ).
John.
