matroxfb supports multihead and fbcon already has this feature for a
long time, ie you can bind /dev/fb0 to tty0-3 and /dev/fb1 to tty4-6.
And there are definite users because I happen to break this feature once
and I got rained with complaints :-)

You can't drop something that's already in the kernel and has users, well,
the binding part at least. What we don't currently have is the fine-grained
control and because of the reason's you mentioned, I said that it's for the
future.
(Note1: fbcon already has support to selectively bind/unbind drivers
to specific tty's, using the con2fbmap utility.)
So what we have is control for wholescale binding and unbinding of
drivers, which essentially results in only 1 driver loaded at one time.
(Note2: fbcon already has an option to determine what range of vc's to
control, as a kernel boot parameter, so we can't just drop something 
that's already supported by one driver at least.  Though I know of no one,
including myself, who uses this feature.)

Yes.
