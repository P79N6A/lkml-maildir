The spurious completions during NCQ error is indicating that the drive 
has indicated it's completed NCQ command tags which weren't outstanding. 
  It's normally a result of a bad NCQ implementation on the drive. 
Technically we can live with it, but it's rather dangerous (if it 
indicates completions for non-outstanding commands, how do we know it 
doesn't indicate completions for actually outstanding commands that 
aren't actually completed yet..)
