Hello,
i have some problems using sk_buffers and Kernel 2.2.x. Perhaps someone
could help me. (I tried to look in the archive, but the search engine did not work)
First of all: is there a good documentation about using sk_buffers?
Now my Problem: 
I want to write a little "Firewall". My problem is, how to reply 
to an "echo request" ( I do not want to block them). 
I am getting  (struct firewall_ops *this, int pf, 
struct device *dev, void *phdr, void *arg, struct sk_buff **pskb) from 
the function firewall_(forward|input|output)_check. 
I think, this is all I need.
I though, I could use the **pskb to reply to the request.
I looked in net/ipv4/ip_* to learn how to manage the sk_buffers.
But everytime I want to send the buffer, the computer crashs.
I used skb->dst->output (skb) (like the functions in ip_output.c)
or dev_queue_xmit (skb). 
Even when I create a new sk_buffer (allocating mem and so on), 
it did not work. When using skb->dst->output my computer reboots, when 
using dev_queue_xmit nothing happens.
I do not want to bother you, but could someone give me a litle example
or send me a url where I can learn more about using sk_buffer?
Thanks for your help
