Actually, in Centera we use generic hardware with a fairly normal kernel 
which has strategic backports from upstream (libata, nic drivers, etc).
No UPS in the picture.  Data integrity is protected by working with the 
application team to insure they understand when data is safely on the 
disk platter and working with IO & FS people to try and make sure we 
don't lie to them (too much ) about that promise.
The centera boxes are tested with power failure & error injection and by 
all of our customers in all those ways customers do ;-)
