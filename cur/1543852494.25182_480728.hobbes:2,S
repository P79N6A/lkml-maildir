What's MAX_JIFFIES? Is it MAX_ULONG? jiffies is unsigned long
so you'll have to be careful with unsigned long arithmetic.
Consider that now is 5 and t->sched_info.last_queued is 10.
On my system
perl -e '{printf("%lu\n", -5 + (1<<32) - 1);}'
4294967291
perl -e '{printf("%lu\n", -5 );}'

hmm.. jiffies wrapped around in sched_info_depart()? I've never seen
that happen. Could you post the additions and user space tool to look at?
What additional features are you planning to measure in the scheduler?
