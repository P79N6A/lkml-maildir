 And we'd get a lot more crashes on broken systems that do not handle NMIs 
in the SMM -- this is the very reason the NMI watchdog is disabled these 
days by default.  A whole lot of systems simply cannot handle NMIs 
happening randomly.
 Programming an I/O APIC to deliver the RTC interrupt (or any other that's 
edge-triggered) as an NMI is itself trivial (we can do this for the PIT 
for the NMI watchdog already).
