GAT,
Not sure how to comment, but did enabling the chipset code make it work?
Second your case is one where the generic code can not find DMA space,
therefore you are forced into PIO, and that will place the system under an
extra load to potential produce your problem.
So the question back is does the chipset code work?
If so then a generic blurb about sound would be valid in at least two
cases and that make a good case for inclusion.
