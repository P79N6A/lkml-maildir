I think it is a regression in recent rc versions as I use 2.6.24-xx kernels on
my new laptop from the very beginnig I have the laptopt and I did not notice
such behaviour before.
I have 1 GB RAM and I was coping a 2GB file from the network to the laptop.
After the operation, 600MB of the swap area has been consumed. At the
beginning of the copy, the swap area was empty.
