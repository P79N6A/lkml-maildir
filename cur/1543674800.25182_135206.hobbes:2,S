Here's another one for your list: when CLONE_DETACHED threads were
removed from /proc several approaches were suggested to let procps find
out about them and none of them were implemented.  There's some real
potential for badness with these mostly-invisible processes.  Something
needs to be added so that we can display and detect them.
