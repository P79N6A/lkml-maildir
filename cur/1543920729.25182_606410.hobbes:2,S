I really don't think this should work.
Doing "sg_next()" on a valid sg is *always* ok. So if the old code didn't 
work, then "sg" wasn't valid to start with (and the code *after* the 
sg_next() would have oopsed even if you try to avoid using sg_next.
So avoiding the "sg_next()" on the last entry is pointless. 
Also, your patch makes the code almost totally unreadable, with that 
subtle issue of the "if (bvprv && cluster)" case not triggering on the 
first case, so the NULL initial sg is "safe".
So at a guess, I think the *real* problem is simply that the passed-in 
sglist was just too small. What guarantees that the sg list allocation 
(apparently done by scsi_alloc_sgtable()) is big enough? 
If I read things right, scsi_alloc_sgtable() will allocate "cmd->use_sg" 
SG enties, no? But I also notice that it does not seem to initialize the 
SG allocation, so those SG entries contain random crap - including, 
perhaps, a random - and bogus - chain pointer in sg->page..
Yes, we set sh->page *if* we create a chain, but if we don't chain, we 
leave the old random contents around which in turn may include old and 
stale chain pointers. Or am I missing something?
So when you added that "memset(sg, 0, sizeof(*sg))" into blk_rq_map_sg(), 
you did it way too late - it needs to be done when the sg chain is 
allocated, and for every entry (and then the "link" entry needs to be 
linked in separately)
I think.
