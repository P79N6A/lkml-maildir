Again, for debugging... it would be interesting to replace this with:
LOW_PAGES = (0x100000000-__PAGE_OFFSET) >> PAGE_SHIFT_asm
... to smoke out further problems; this will take the strict definition 
of "lowmem" (modulo the pci region, which someone unwisely made 
dynamically adjustable... which would have been fine if initramfs could 
live in highmem, which it can't yet.)
