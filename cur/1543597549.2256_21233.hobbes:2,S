If it's locking up just after printing out the `NET3' banner,
don't bother - known problem with softirqs.  It'll be fixed
in the next kernel.

Wouldn't have a clue.  It isn't spinning on a lock.
It almost looks as if the timer interrupt isn't getting
cleared, and the CPU is never leaving the interrupt.  But
that would cause the timer interrupt count to increase like
crazy and the NMI would never have kicked in.  Nice one.
For interest's sake, could you please try booting with the
`noapic' option, and also send another NMI watchdog trace?
Thanks.
