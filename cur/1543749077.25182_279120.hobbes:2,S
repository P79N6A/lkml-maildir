Most of it actually. But perhaps your mailer just messed up the patch?
Anyways, if there are no negative comments I would recommend you
submit your patch (preferably in a non messed up form) to akpm@osdl.org
for inclusion into -mm*. The other parts of the proposal (converting
the existing users and deprecating register_ioctl32_conversion) could be 
attacked then.
There is also some related work that could be done easily then,
e.g. the network stack ioctls currently drop the BKL as first thing.
With ioctl_native that could be probably done better. There may 
be other such low hanging fruit areas too.
