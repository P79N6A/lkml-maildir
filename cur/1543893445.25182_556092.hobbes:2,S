I have a 386 here that allows 5M, with 4x256K in bank 0 and 4x1M in bank 1 
(it has 16M). 4M, let alone 16, wouldn't work on a 5M machine ofcourse.
But, it's just a default anyway. Would it be considered beneficial to more 
explicitly provide a few options through a config menu, something like the 
attached?
I don't know how to also (cleanly) provide a custom value in addition to the 
choices in Kconfig but maybe more options are not actually considered useful 
anyway?
And perhaps it's not considered useful period. Please just drop on the floor 
if so.
Rene.
