Hi Johnson,
I tried with depmod -e option. It showed that printk is unresolved
symbol. Is it current? Is it(printk) not a kernel symbol? If so, give me
a suggestion.
Note: I included the <linux/kernel.h> and <linux/module.h> also. Please
see the attachments.
Thanks and regards,
Srinivas G

Maybe `depmod -e ...` would tell you what symbols are missing??
Then, after you observe that, try including <linux/kernel.h>,
and <linux/module.h>, like you are supposed to do.
