I guess its because of an uninitialized helper field in struct
nf_conntrack_expect, which is then copied from the expectation to
the conntrack entry.
Peter, do you have locally generated netbios ns queries on the machine
running nf_conntrack? If so, please try this patch. Otherwise, are
there any other conntrack helpers that are actually used?
[NETFILTER]: nf_conntrack_netbios_ns: fix uninitialized member in expectation
->helper is uninitialized in the expectation registered by the netbios_ns
helper and it later copied to the expected connection, which causes invalid
memory dereferences when trying to call the helper.
