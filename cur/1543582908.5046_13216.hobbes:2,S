looking further at 
net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c:tcp_create_openreq_child() (for 2.2.16)
and
net/ipv4/tcp_minisocks.c:tcp_create_openreq_child() (for 2.4.x)
immediately after the sk_alloc() call (if it successful) it calls
	memcpy(newsk, sk, sizeof(*newsk))
i suggest setting your NULL initial values immediately after this line.
sorry for the premature email
