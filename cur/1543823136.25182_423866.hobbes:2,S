    For PIO2+ actually, according to Intel's PRM (29860004.pdf), and it's said
to have no effect in the lower modes. This is actually not very correct since
when one issues Set Transfer Mode ATA command with the value (8 + PIOn), this
means select PIO _flow control_ mode n, so -IORDY is assumed to be in use.

    What is/was the point for keeping MW DMA 0 support anyway? On PIIX, it's
greatly slowed down (600 vs 480 ns cycle) and was never "offically" supported
by Intel.
