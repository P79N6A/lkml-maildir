If I understood the above correctly, regarding a kernel space iSCSI
target implementation, only LIO-SE and SCST should be considered. What
I know today about these Linux iSCSI target implementations is as
follows:
* SCST performs slightly better than LIO-SE, and LIO-SE performs
slightly better than STGT (both with regard to latency and with regard
to bandwidth).
* The coding style of SCST is closer to the Linux kernel coding style
than the coding style of the LIO-SE project.
* The structure of SCST is closer to what Linus expects than the
structure of LIO-SE (i.e., authentication handled in userspace, data
transfer handled by the kernel -- LIO-SE handles both in kernel
space).
* Until now I did not encounter any strange behavior in SCST. The
issues I encountered with LIO-SE are being resolved via the LIO-SE
mailing list (
http://groups.google.com/group/linux-iscsi-target-dev
).
It would take too much effort to develop a new kernel space iSCSI
target from scratch -- we should start from either LIO-SE or SCST. My
opinion is that the best approach is to start with integrating SCST in
the mainstream kernel, and that the more advanced features from LIO-SE
that are not yet in SCST can be ported from LIO-SE to the SCST
framework.
Nicholas, do you think the structure of SCST is powerful enough to be
extended with LIO-SE's powerful features like ERL-2 ?
