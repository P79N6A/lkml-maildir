The enabled one :-)
I don't see a general solution.
You can know if an AGP card's vga portion is enabled by checking the
corresponding bit in the pci bridge configuration space. But for PCI
cards there is no standard way of enabling vga.
If you have only one card with I/O enabled you can know this is the
card. If you have more, you can write to the 0xb8000 region, and see in
what linear aperture the write happens.
