IIRC, it's supposed to work just like normal reading from a
floppy. That should still work.

The intent is that root_device_name is changed, so it should just
work. Has something broken? AFAIK, this too used to work.
I'll try to have a closer look at this tonight. Which kernel version
are you staring at?
BTW: you didn't respond to my question about fixing devfs+blkdev
races. If my scheme will work, or at least improve things, I'd like to
include that in my next patch. Marcelo is waiting for me to fix
something else. Here's what I wrote a couple of days ago:

How about if I do this sequence:
	lock_kernel();
	devfs checks;
	if (bd_op->owner)
		__MOD_INC_USE_COUNT(bd_op->owner);
	revalidate();
	if (bd_op->owner)
		__MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT(bd_op->owner);
	unlock_kernel();
Is there any reason why that won't work?
