After switching consoles a couple of times, it the switch no longer
succeeded but hanged. I had to reboot. Noe that I can access the log, I
see:

(The show regs was issued by me although I never saw the output.) This
also shows that the clock has stopped completely, it was ~21.00 when I
pressed sysrq-p - the machine stopped responding ping at ~13.00.
Stuck on TLB IPI wait... Perhaps this is a BP6 problem after all?
