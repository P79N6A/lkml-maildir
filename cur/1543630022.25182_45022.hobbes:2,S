Is memmap[i++] so much worse? Let me repeat, this is only executed once
at boot!

And it's called virtual address space.

_Please_ show me an example.

Are we looking at the same code??? Where is that zero-offset thingie? It
just works with virtual and physical addresses and needs to convert
between them.

That also works with just physical and virtual addresses. What are you
talking about???
