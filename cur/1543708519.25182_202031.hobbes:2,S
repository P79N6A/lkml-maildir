It probably isn't difficult to add this to the applications, but since
I haven't seen the source code to them, it's hard to say.  When I
modified efibootmgr to handle either /proc-style or /sys-style
entries, whichever was present, it wasn't difficult, and really made
the code cleaner.  I wouldn't think your tools would be that much more difficult.
As Jeff hinted, if your userspace<->driver ABI is consistent between
your new MPT-based RAID controllers and your existing megaraid driver,
then perhaps you need a single small helper module (lsiioctl or some
better name), loaded by both mptraid and megaraid automatically, which
handles registering the /dev/megaraid node dynamically.  In this case,
both mptraid and megaraid would register with lsiioctl for each
adapter discovered, and lsiioctl would essentially be a switch,
redirecting userspace tool ioctls to the appropriate driver.
Thanks,
Matt
