not sure. It could be qemu being scheduled away? You could try to run 
qemu with nice -20 or so, to avoid getting preempted. If time lapses 
like this still show up:
 trace-cm 434   0D.h. 1008us!: do_timer (tick_periodic)
 trace-cm 434   0D.h. 1972us+: update_wall_time (do_timer)
 trace-cm 434   0D.h. 1008us!: do_timer (tick_periodic)
 trace-cm 434   0D.h. 1972us+: update_wall_time (do_timer)
then that could indicate a timekeeping weirdness, OR it could mean that 
qemu is simply very slow. (there could be timer hw access between those 
two function calls)
