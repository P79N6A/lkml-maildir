I have a 3ware SATA 8500-4 controller with 4x WD 36GB Raptor SATA drives.
Wow.  Just "wow".  At least a factor of 2 better than what I've seen 
before.  I think a boatload of that is the 5ms seek time, gotta love 
that.  
I'm burning them in, if they work then we'll use those for bkbits.net.
If you guys need me to run any tests/kernels against this mix let me
know.
These are nice drives.  I got 4 drives and the controller from newegg
for about $950 shipped including tax.
