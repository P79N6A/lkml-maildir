Alan, kupdate _only_ recall sync_old_buffers(). Even if it would _not_
work (so it would not recall sync_old_buffers()), then you should _not_
see fs corruption anyway.
If there is fs corruption and you always unmounted cleanly the harddisks
then kupdate is _unrelated_.

I reproduced fs corruption on the postponed-msg mailbox with 2.3.18 clean
if I remeber well. But I don't remeber well so don't trust such
information. I had lots of patches (kupdate not yet developed for 2.3.x at
that time) and so I can't assure my fs corruption is the same seen by
other people. My one replaced the data of the file with zeros.

I think it's not trivial to reproduce, and I think that's the reason they
reported some kernel working and some other failing. I suggest to run
2.3.18ac2 again for a long time.
