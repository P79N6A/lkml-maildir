I suspect that this part of the patch to airo.c is incorrect.  The
intent seems to be to clear a section of memory pointed to by range that
contains (or will soon contain) a struct iw_range.  The sizeof(*range)
is equivalent of the sizeof(struct iw_range) above.  The patch reduces
the size of the memset to the size of the pointer (which I'm assuming is
smaller than the structure [/me goes and looks]).
Of course, the range pointer is derived from the char *extra
parameter...  this could mean that we're actually getting a pre-filled
iw_range and the memset is only supposed to clear the first member.  If
that's the case, I would hope that the author could come up with a
cleaner way of expressing that.
