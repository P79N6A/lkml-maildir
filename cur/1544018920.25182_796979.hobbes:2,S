But you get more TLB local allocations.

Its going to be quite difficult to realize algorithm that guestimate what
information the processor keeps in its caches. The situation is quite
complex in NUMA systems.

Its the per cpu slab. SLUB does not switch pages often but frees objects
not from the per cpu slab directly with minimal overhead compared to a per
cpu slab free. The overhead is much less than the SLAB slowpath which has
to be taken for alien caches etc.
