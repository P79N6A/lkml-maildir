Hi,
yesterday, I've send mail below to this list. Today I've noticed that on 
2.6.17, kjournald is running with nice level -5. On 2.6.16, kjournald is 
running with nice level 0. I did "renice 0 `pgrep kjournald`" and it 
have "solved" my problem.
I wonder why have been changed the nice level of kjournald in 2.6.17 kernel?
Thanks,
Martin Kourim
