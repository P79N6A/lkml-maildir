What consensus do you see here?  Two people?  I didn't even see any
cases where this behavior was said to be used -- only said to be
needed in a few rare cases.
AC posted in this thread, saying that assert code already exists in the
kernel, in the networking code (grep for BUG_TRAP).  Guess what?  It
evaluates to null.  In fact, grepping around, every assert macro I could
find in the kernel (not many, granted) evaluates to null in its
non-debug form.
Evaluating to null is the standard set by both the existing kernel
sources and ANSI C.  NOT evaluating to null potentially slows down a
fast path, if a kassert() is used there.  Why use it, if it breaks with
tradition and creates slower production code?
So, my suggested updates to your kassert.h:
o Evaluate to null in non-debug form ;-)  Copy code from BUG_TRAP
  instead of simply "#define kassert(cond)".  It wraps a null do-while.
o Allow developer to redefine REPORT_LEVEL by wrapping it in an #ifndef
o Is there some central file that the CONFIG_xxx selection can be moved
  to, so avoid changing each port's Config.in?  Maybe source
  linux/kernel/Config.in (new file) from each port instead.
  There are too much common stuff in the port Config.in's anyway, IMHO.
