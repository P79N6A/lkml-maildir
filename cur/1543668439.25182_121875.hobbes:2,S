Simply because quite a lot of the tmpfs code is concerned with moving
pages between ram and swap: if you've limited ram and no swap, you may
not want to waste your ram on that code!  One day I might try applying
#ifdef CONFIG_SWAPs within mm/shmem.c; but I might well not, it could
get ugly, and looks rudimentary elsewhere - do we intend to get serious
about CONFIG_SWAP?
