After some hunting (kernel hackers guide proved fruitless, web searches
were the same, looked in fs/buffer.c and found
void invalidate_bdev(struct block_device *bdev, int destroy_dirty_buffers);
Found use of it in block_dev.c:
/* Kill _all_ buffers, dirty or not.. */
static void kill_bdev(struct block_device *bdev)
{
	invalidate_bdev(bdev, 1);
	truncate_inode_pages(bdev->bd_inode->i_mapping, 0);
}	
So hopefully I can just invalidate the block device when I need to.
