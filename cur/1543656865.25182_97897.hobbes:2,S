I'm no IDE RAID expert, however I've build quite a few linux servers
for customers.
If IDE raid unix linux is needed here, there's no question that a
linux supported (thanks adam) 3ware card is dropped in, no questions
asked.  For my 3 years of working with them under linux THEY JUST
WORK.  Native monitoring tools included too..
