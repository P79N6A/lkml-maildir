Not sure whats going on with your systems, Zoltan, but I'm running a 
M$ bluetooth optical RF mouse into a usb port, running 
2.6.12-rc5-git9 with no known gotchas.  Booted for about 8 hours now.
From my dmesg:
drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c: v2.01:USB HID core driver
mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
...
input: USB HID v1.11 Mouse [Microsoft Microsoft Wireless Optical 
Mouse® 1.0A] on usb-0000:00:02.1-2.1--
