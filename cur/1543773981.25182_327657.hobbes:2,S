You shouldn't call usb_create_sysfs_intf_files in any case.
Your driver is returning -EIO from its probe routine according to the log,
so it's not getting bound to the device.  Hence there shouldn't be any
attempt to unbind the device when your driver is removed.  This is a bug
in usbcore; it tries to delete all the interfaces without checking whether 
they were successfully added.
