I asked vojtech@suse.cz as one of the driver developer
this is how I did it (just prototype)
(neccessary just one folder and two files)
1. copy template linux-source/drivers/input/joystick/magellan.c
2. insert in line 90  :
	printk("%s:\"%s\"\n",__FUNCTION__, data);
3. make and insert it
4. inputattach --magellan /dev/ttyS0 &
5. date > /dev/ttyS0
6. dmesg | tail
voilà!
[output von dmesg]
	[27336.486980] serio: Serial port ttyS0
	[27336.487270] input: LogiCad3D Magellan / SpaceMouse as
/class/input/input6 [27336.518603] magellan_process_packet:"Mi  6 Jun
19:22:31 CEST 2007"
