Sorry, it breaks my machine in "interesting" way. Cursor no longer
blinks, sleep 1 takes more than five seconds, ...
Pentium-M in compaq evo n620c notebok, cpufreq active:
pavel@Elf:~$ dmesg | grep tick
dyn-tick: Found suitable timer: tsc
dyn-tick: Registering dynamic tick timer v050610-1
dyn-tick: Maximum ticks to skip limited to 13
dyn-tick: Timer not enabled during boot
pavel@Elf:~$
Ouch, even system time seems to go slower. I'll try setting
DYNTICK_USE_APIC next.
