Well, in this case, it wasn't so nebulous, to me anyway.
The "Hack" referred to has a big fat comment beginning:
 *
 * Hack:
 *
 *    Set the exiting tasks cpuset to the root cpuset (top_cpuset).
 *
 *    Don't leave a task unable to allocate memory, as ...
and is labeled at the scene of the Hack with:
        tsk->cpuset = &top_cpuset;      /* Hack - see comment above */
So "Hack" was intended as a proper noun, not a nebulous generic term.
But, sure, hard to argue with anyone wanting improved comments.
And while I'm at it, I will change the name of this Hack to something
less generic ... say "the_top_cpuset_hack".
Patch coming soon.
