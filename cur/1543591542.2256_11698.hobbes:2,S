This is the core of why we cannot (IMHO) have a discussion
of whether a patch introducing new VM tunables can go in:
there is no clear overview of exactly what would need to be
tunable and how it would help.
When you and Ingo have something more specific to talk about,
I guess we can decide on that; but deciding on something like
this isn't really possible without at least knowing what should
be tunable ;)

Rik
