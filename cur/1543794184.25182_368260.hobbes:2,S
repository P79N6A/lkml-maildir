even with my patch the robust-futex code is still quite broken. E.g. in 
down_futex(), it accesses rt-mutex internals without any locking (!):
        if (rt_mutex_free(lock)) {
                __down_mutex(lock __EIP__);
                rt_mutex_set_owner(lock, owner_task->thread_info);
        }
both rt_mutex_free() and rt_mutex_set_owner() must be called with the 
proper locking. David?
