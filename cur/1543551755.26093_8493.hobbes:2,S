You know, it would help if I posted the right pseudocode.
Yes, I found this race condition a while ago.  I do set flagvar _before_ I
chew on the hardware.
Nevertheless, what I'm seeing looks like either (a) the change to flagvar
isn't being propagated from the IRQ handler to the thread, or (b) the
down() fails to sleep for no good reason.
