I don't see why the kernel can't map this magic page to the same
virtual address for each process. I assumed you'd want to do that for
code anyway.

Yeah, OK. But user-space can MAP_INHERIT the code which is appropriate
for the CPU.

Why do you say I've ignored the security issues? I've suggested a
number of ways of dealing with that. I've not seen any replies saying
that the solutions are flawed.
The re-building page table argument sounds like it's the killer,
though. I assume you're saying that we'd lose VM optimisations if we
have to avoid touching certain vma's when tearing down page tables?
