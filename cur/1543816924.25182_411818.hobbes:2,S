Notwithstanding the HUP, I've investigated this and have found that 
there is more instability than expected and that it is due to a silly 
bit of code (by me) at the end of find_busiest_queue() marked by the 
comment:
/* or if there's a reasonable chance that *imbalance is big
  * enough to cause a move
  */
that makes load balancing more aggressive.  The functionality it 
implemented should have been abandoned when the code was updated to use 
average run queue loads instead of SCHED_LOAD_SCALE in the code that 
handled small imbalances but wasn't.  I'll send Andrew a patch that 
removes the offending code shortly.
