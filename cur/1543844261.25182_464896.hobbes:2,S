Not necessarily - you could have both compiled in, and each would only
worry about the resource management that they cared about - e.g. you
could use the memory node isolation portion of cpusets (in conjunction
with fake numa nodes/zones) for memory containment, but give every
cpuset access to all CPUs and control CPU usage via the resource
groups CPU controller.
The generic code would take care of details like container
creation/destruction (with appropriate callbacks into cpuset and/or
res_group code, tracking task membership of containers, etc.
