Our kernel build process has to look at CONFIG_xxx because we build
multiple kernels from the same base .config.

I have no control over what you choose to do.  It's a free 'net, and you
are free to ignore any and all suggestions.
The normal way to get patches into the kernel is to split them up.  I
just sent Linus 21 patches, which got condensed into

Separate out your changes.  Make the maintainers aware of your changes. 
ie. if it modifies my driver's CONFIG_xxx usage or my subsystem's
Config.in, let me know.  ("me" == any maintainer)
Read Documentation/SubmittingPatches.
