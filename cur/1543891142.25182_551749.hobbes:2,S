Nope. An errored connection is always ready for read/write -- there is
nothing to wait for as far as the kernel is concerned. Your code keeps
asking the kernel if something interesting has happened, the kernel keeps
telling it yes, and it refuses to do anything about it.
At minimum, a detection of an error condition that could be persistent
should be followed by a delay. A detection of an error condition that has in
fact persisted and was previously detected should *never* be followed by an
immediate return to 'select'.
You need to *handle* the I/O error. Backoff might be one way, sleeping for
an increasing amount of time after each fatal error, subject to some limit.
And why are you calling FIONREAD? Just 'read' the data -- you're going to
have to eventually anyway.
