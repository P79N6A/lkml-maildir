Let me rephrase so it is clear.
When dealing with pids there is exactly one case where we need
to take read_lock(&tasklist_lock);
Posix (and sanely handling corner cases) requires that when we send a
signal to a process group or a session we have a snapshot in time view
of the entire group.  In particular this allows us to send SIGKILL to
every member of the group and to have the entire group die.
For all other cases (like /proc) we can safely and simply use the
rcu_read_lock and it improves scalability.
So for those cases where we are sending a signal to multiple processes
it looks like we need to go in and change the code to say:
read_lock(&tasklist_lock);
rcu_read_lock();
...
rcu_read_unlock();
read_unlock(&tasklist_lock);
Which is all sane, and should be correct and maintainable in the
future and is relatively easy to understand.
Of course if we start with find_get_pid and then later do put_pid we
are also fine.  The current code is a little extra confused right now
because we have not completed the pid namespace conversion.  Although
we are getting quite close.
