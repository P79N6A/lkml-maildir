Agreed, there is a "confusion cost" to that.

At the moment, but possibly not in the future (if one day
usnhare() needs a flag that has no analogue in clone()).

Not sure what future incoherence you mean here.  Anyway,
we inject some incoherence *now* (some unshare() flags reverse
their clone() counterparts, one does not).

I'm not trying to do that.  I've repeated my statements 
because I haven't seen any clear counterarguments.  I have a
particular opinion about what constitutes confusion, and it
comes from a perspective that focuses on the kernel-userland 
interface.  I agree that it does create some "confusion cost"
for userland programmers to add new flags.  But _in my opinion_
that cost is outweighed by the greater "confusion costs" that
I have described.  Eric seemed to agree.  Unfortunately for my
argument, you and Janak don't ;-).
Cheers,
Michael
