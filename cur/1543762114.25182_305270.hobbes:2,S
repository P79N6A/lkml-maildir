Yes, but scsi_release_buffers isn't referring to bounce buffers anymore,
it's simply releasing the sg buffers.

I'll defer to Jens here, but I don't thing you can just remove this ...
sg_io with a misaligned buffer will fail without this.
That rather nasty code freeing cmd->buffer needs to be in there as
well ... so it does make sense to keep this API
