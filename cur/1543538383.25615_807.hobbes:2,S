AFAIK that is caused by gcc using instructions that exist on P-II but
not P-I, including instructions like conditional move (CMOVE).
Unfortunately those instructions are used everywhere, including in
printk.  No way to get a message out without detecting the problem in
the real mode boot loader and using BIOS I/O.
