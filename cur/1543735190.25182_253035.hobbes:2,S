Right now, I'm thinking the switch_to assembly
has bad asm constraints.
I count 8 items passed in or out of the asm.
I count 11 clobbers. You don't have 19 registers.
If you pass something in and then destroy it,
you're supposed to use a dummy output. Look at
the i386 version, where esi and edi are dummy
outputs for this reason.
I recall seeing i386 compilers complain about
clobbered inputs. I guess the x86-64 gcc needs
to have this warning added?
