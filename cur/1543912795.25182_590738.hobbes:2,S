The latter is the code by Video54 Technologies?

Sorry, this has been a thinko on my side:
If noone except you and onoe-san made any contributions to this code 
that were non-trivial enough for automatically giving its author a 
copyright on his contributions (whatever this means in various 
jurisdictions...) it was indeed an author-only change.
