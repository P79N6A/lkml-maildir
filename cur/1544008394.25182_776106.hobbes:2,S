Hi,
SI_ASYNCIO is defined in include/asm-generic/siginfo.h as:
	#define SI_ASYNCIO      -4              /* sent by AIO completion */
The negative value makes it a 'user-space' signal according to 
	#define SI_FROMUSER(siptr)      ((siptr)->si_code <= 0)
	#define SI_FROMKERNEL(siptr)    ((siptr)->si_code > 0)
But this signal is generated in the kernel async_completed() -
drivers/usb/core/devio.c
Am trying to understand why this is considered as a user-space signal ?
Isn't SI_ASYNCIO similar to SI_POLL or SI_MESGQ - both of which are
'kernel-signals' ?
POSIX.1 explicitly ignores async io. 
Thanks,
Sukadev
