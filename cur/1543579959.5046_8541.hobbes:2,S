Hm. As a point of comparison, I use a similar system to yours (full SCSI,
though, no IDE) and I can copy a 100MB file from disk-to-disk, or on the
same disk, in around 13 seconds. Where are you copying to the SCSI drive
from - the same drive, an IDE disk, CDROM? If IDE, what are its
particulars? (Check with hdparm -iI /dev/hd?)
