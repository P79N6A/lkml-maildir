I know sucky huh? I was assuming you had done some testing.. It's
unfortunate that you haven't (I know your busy tho)

Only in so much as the high res changes parallel my own. That includes
from my set the update_callback removal and the rating sorted list.
thats about where the similarity stops, even those changes don't appear
to have the breath of mine.
My patch set is more extensive. The changes Thomas made exist only to
allow the verify functionality .

Seems backwards , clean ups should always go first. If Thomas had
started off my patch set his changes would have been smaller and
hopefully stronger. (I even remember you tell me that you wanted the
kernel/time/timekeeping.c change first in my series cause clean ups
should go first..)
If the HRT changes went in I would have to re-make my cleanups, then do
more cleanup to change the stuff Thomas is introducing. Looking at his
code, to do a clean up I would want to just outright revert it.

The release of HRT is a dead duck anyway. It's way to late in the 2.6.20
release cycle to be introducing that extensive of a rewrite. I'm not in
control of that tho.

Do you remember Thomas was CC'd on all my releases, and all of your
comments got CC'd to him (as far as I remember). So it's hard to imagine
that any of the code collision is on your hands.
Given the circumstances I don't see how we can do anything less than
resolve the conflicts .. My cleanups first, then his code and condense
and update his set. I'll gladly volunteer to do that.
