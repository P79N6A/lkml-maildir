It may be a bug in the 180.06 driver.  Try 177.80 which comes with
Ubuntu 8.10.  However...

Not really.  You'll either need a snapshot of the way things were, or
to reinstall, to bring it back to normal.  The NVIDIA custom installer
plays with all sorts of files all over the place, not just the kernel
configuration.  The main issue is that it will have modified files that
are under the control of the package manager (or are delegated by the
package manager to other utilities to manage).

"man dkms" will get you started with learning about DKMS, and you can
also look it up on Google.
The point of DKMS is to permit you to update your kernel and have it
manage the binary drivers with source interfaces (or even pure-source
drivers that aren't in the kernel tree) for you.  As such, it does work
with a vanilla kernel---this is how I use it because installing new
kernels doesn't do anything that would confuse dpkg.
On Ubuntu, you probably want to do:
 $ make all && make install && make modules_install && \
   update-initramfs -c -k ${KERNEL_VERSION} && update-grub
That is how I do mine.
update-initramfs and update-grub are utilities provided by
Debian/Ubuntu.
