The copy completed some time ago, but now I cannot ssh into the box!
This is a new development, as before I was always able to ssh into,
even when the copy slowed down to a trickle.
I'm far from the machine right now, so I will do some more tests
tonight, but right now, the new patchset is not good.  What is the
difference between reverting the patch you sent yesterday and your
current fifth patch?  I assume the other four are identical, right?
