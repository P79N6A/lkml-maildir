I hit this bug a while back - most often it's for 4byte sized objects 
(ints or pointers) on x86 arch (don't know about others).  Unfortunately 
there was a case where it was for an 8 and was wrongly declared via sizeof 
and thus 4.  I'd suggest moving all to single sizeof's and where this 
causes API changes to implement bogus/extra declarations which could then 
possibly be faded out with time.  However currently the glibc kernel 
headers are also similarly screwed.  Obviously this would bloat the kernel 
a little, OTOH for x86 arch I only noticed one case where it didn't end up 
the same whether thru double or single sizeof.  Perhaps we could be lucky 
and have almost as much luck on other archs?
