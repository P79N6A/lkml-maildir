"a machine that locks up hard" is a pretty uncommon case, and it should 
be ruled out by the following two factors:
- patch must be in Linus' tree
- I'm asking the patch authors and maintainers of the affected subsystem
  whether the patch is OK for 2.6.16
You never achieve 0% risk, but many bug fixes have a much higher risk of 
regression.
I do know that the only value of the 2.6.16 tree lies in a lack of 
regressions and act accordingly, and as soon as people will report 
regressions compared to earlier 2.6.16 kernels I'll know that I'll have 
done something wrong (but I haven't yet gotten such bug reports).
