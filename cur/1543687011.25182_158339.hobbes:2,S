Acrobat has a switch so that it keeps a cache of rendered pages, and
obviously it default to ON, so just reading a big PDF file page by
page will trash all the system with lots useless data. BUT, for simple
PDF usage in a non-multitasking single-user machine it's faster
so there you have a possible reason for it's strange behaviour.

1. Dado un programa, siempre tiene al menos un fallo.
2. Dadas varias lineas de codigo, siempre se pueden acortar a menos lineas.
3. Por induccion, todos los programas se pueden
   reducir a una linea que no funciona.
