The correct way to use the ioctl, would be something like this :
changed = ioctl(drive, CDROM_MEDIA_CHANGED, CDSL_CURRENT);
And that is the only way you can do it. There's no way you can retrieve
the info by trying to call media_changed() - userspace programs can't
access kernelspace functions like that. Hey, that's one of the reasons
for ioctl!
