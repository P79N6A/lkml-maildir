Yeah, this also sort of echo a recent discovery on one of our benchmarks
that schedule() is red hot in the kernel.  I was just scratching my head
not sure what's going on.  This dependent_sleeper could be the culprit
considering it is called almost at every context switch.  I don't think
we are hitting on lock contention, but by the large amount of code it
executes.  It really needs to be cut down ....
