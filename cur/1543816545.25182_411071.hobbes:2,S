I like the current approach, that is, load pcspkr to get a beep, load 
pcspkr+snd-pcsp to get the full blow.
On some servers, I need a mixture of when to allow a beep and when not. In 
these, I patched the oops and panic functions to make a sound, which 
implies that pcspkr.ko must be loaded. In turn, I modified vt.c to have the 
default bell time = 0 to shut /bin/*sh up. Works good.
