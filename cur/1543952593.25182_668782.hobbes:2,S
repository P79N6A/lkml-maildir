Can you bisect it? There's only 343 commits between -rc5 and -rc6, so it 
should not take too long to check which commit it is. Even if it should 
take 9 reboots to bisect it entirely, going just five or six will likely 
narrow it down sufficiently that we can probably guess fairly well what 
it's about.
