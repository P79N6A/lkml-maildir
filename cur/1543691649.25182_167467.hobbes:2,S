Subject: 2.6.0-test5-bk8 breaks VMWare build

I don't know if this should be considered a VMWare or a kernel problem.  This works fine under 2.6.0-test3-bk8, so a header that VMWare depends on has changed.  The 
`__set_64bit_var': warning does occur in test3-bk8, but the module safely compiles.
None of VMware Workstation's pre-built vmmon modules is suitable for your
running kernel.  Do you want this program to try to build the vmmon module for
your system (you need to have a C compiler installed on your system)? [yes]
Using compiler "/usr/bin/gcc". Use environment variable CC to override.
What is the location of the directory of C header files that match your running
kernel? [/lib/modules/2.6.0-test5-bk8/build/include]
