When read() or write() is used after sysfs_remove_file(), it doesn't call 
the function and returns -ENODEV. I would assume that it will wait for a 
running show() or store() before leaving sysfs_remove_file() too - if it 
doesn't then it should...

b) You're right here, I'll need to add a mutex for that whole function.

Yes, the sysfs attributes are set up in bind so the user can change the polling before 
atm_start is called. Also the device could be removed while usbatm is still preparing 
to call atm_start.

Yes, this could happen and I designed it so that whichever process sets it to POLLING 
MUST then start polling - if something else wants it to stop it will stop at the end 
of the poll function. The only way to allow something other than the poll function to 
stop it would be to reschedule with the mutex held which I'd rather avoid doing.

Again, it will be stopped at the next poll - it's safer than trying to cancel work 
that may not be scheduled.

They are removed further down in unbind. Polling is safe to continue because 
it is stopped below, and it must continue because:

Cancelling the work causes an infinite loop if the polling is never rescheduled, 
I've written it so that the polling is always either enabled/disabled at this 
point. The SHUTDOWN state prevents anything else changing it.
If it's scheduled to run then it will be cancelled, and if it's running it will 
be cancelled as soon as it gets rescheduled.
I could repeatedly acquire the mutex and check if it's shutdown itself, but 
there would be no point since it won't be any faster.
