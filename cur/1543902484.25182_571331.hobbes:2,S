I've certainly worked on such devices. I expect there are more of them
still in service, than, say, Voyagers.
I haven't looked at whether this CPUID stuff is worth the trouble, I'm
just responding to your argument about init code. Init code is
definitely not free. It takes up storage space, which can be extremely
valuable.
The deeper point is: if you know what your platform is, platform
feature detection is a waste of code, regardless of whether it's
marked init or not.
