I have to agree here, as I've set up several suchlike systems, and
it's for precicely that reason that I'm only discussing the issues
here rather than working on a patch - this is something where the
design HAS to be right before any coding starts.

I can't speak for other architectures, but the common RTC chip on the
ix86 architecture is the 148???? (I forget the rest of the number),
and this has two flags of interest. The first is writable, and tells
the chip whether or not to implement DST, and the second is read only
and states whether the chip is currently returning DST or non-DST
time. I don't have the technical docs handy, so I'll refer to these
two flags as DSTenable and DSTinuse respectively in the text that
follows.
As far as I can see it, the basic kernel algorithm would be something
like the following pseudocode:
 1. Define two kernel parameters, configurable at compile time, as
    follows:
	__s16 rtctz  = Non-DST timezone offset from UTC in minutes
	__s8  rtcdst = RTC's DST shift in minutes
    Note that the latter will normally be +60 and can be regarded as
    being architecture specific.
 2. Read the RTC registers, producing:
	time_t  sysclock = RTC time in time_t format
	boolean dstused  = DSTenable && DSTinuse
 3. Perform the following calculations:
	sysclock -= 60 * RTCTZ
	if (dstused) {
	    sysclock -= 60 * RTCDST
	}
Once that's been done, the kernel's system clock will reflect the UTC
time indicated by the RTC if RTCTZ is set correctly, and since there's
nothing in there that changes any register in the RTC, there's nothing
that can affect the value the RTC returns.

That's why I would only see this code referencing the flag in the RTC
chip, and not tweaking it itself, as stated above.

That's primarily because Windows actually tweaks the RTC chip itself,
and as I see it, that's one thing we MUST avoid doing.
Incidentally, one thing that's often overlooked is that we do NOT need
to ensure that the shift in to and out of DST in the RTC occurs on the
correct date. All we need is to know whether the time returned by the
said chip is the DST or non-DST time, and what the DST shift used by
that chip is, which is why the above pseudocode works.
