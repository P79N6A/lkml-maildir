Hi,
I installed two new SAMSUNG SP1203N (120GB) drives on the same IDE.
But, from the boot log:
hdc: attached ide-disk driver.
hdc: host protected area => 1
hdc: 234493056 sectors (120060 MB) w/2048KiB Cache, CHS=14596/255/63,
UDMA(100)
hdd: attached ide-disk driver.
hdd: host protected area => 1
hdd: setmax_ext LBA 234493056, native  66055248
hdd: 66055248 sectors (33820 MB) w/2048KiB Cache, CHS=4111/255/63, UDMA(100)
So the second one get its capacity limited to ~33GB. I know there is a limit
of 34GB (CHS=4111/255/53) with older BIOSes and kernel, but i believe it
doesnt apply as the first drive got recognized properly. Also, i have
another 120 GB SEAGATE as hda working properly. (So the disk with wrong
capacity is the third IDE drive)
I'm running kernel 2.4.25. CONFIG_IDEDISK_STROKE is off.
Any ideas of what might be happening?
(I'd like to be personally CC'd  answers/comments)
Thanks in advance.
