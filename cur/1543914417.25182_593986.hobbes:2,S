While access=<uid> and dfltuid=<some-other-uid> creates an interesting
flexibility in the way things can be used, I'm wondering if
access=<uid> dfltuid=DEFAULT_UID is intuitive, it might be nice for
the default behavior to be setting defltuid to the uid specified in
access when that access option is used.  This can be overridden with
the dfltuid option, but I think it makes more sense to attach as the
uid you are restricting access to.
If that's the way we want to go, I think that can be handled in a
separate patch.
I've merged this stuff into my test tree, as soon as regressions pass
and I confirm they compile clean on another architecture I'll push
them into my devel to be picked up by -mm.
