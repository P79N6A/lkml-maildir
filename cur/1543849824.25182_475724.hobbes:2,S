Did you send resend the patch to remove sched-domain partitioning?
After clearing up my confusion, IMO that is needed and could probably
go into 2.6.19.

The sched-domains code is all there and just ready to be used. IMO
using the cpusets API (or a slight extension thereof) would be the
best idea if we're going to use any explicit interface at all.
A cool option would be to determine the partitions according to the
disjoint set of unions of cpus_allowed masks of all tasks. I see this
getting computationally expensive though, probably O(tasks*CPUs)... I
guess that isn't too bad.
Might be better than a userspace interface.
