I disagree.  The SCM changelog should contain _what_ a patch does and if
necessary _why_ it does so.  The rest (e.g. the sign-off tag to state
that the licensing is alright, and any other tags) should have its
meaning sufficiently defined outside the changelog.
Remember what the SCM changelog is for, i.e. what we do with it after
commit.
