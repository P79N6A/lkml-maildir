Subject: USB Key light on/off state depending on mount

Most USB keys nowadays have a small LED somewhere inside of them that 
lights up when they are plugged in. On a windows box, the key is lit up 
whenever it is mounted, and as soon as it is unmounted it turns off, 
giving a handy physical indicator that the key is safe to remove. On 
linux, the light is simply on whenever the key is plugged in.
Should linux toggle the light depending on mount state? Is it as trivial 
as it seems or does this reflect some larger issue?
