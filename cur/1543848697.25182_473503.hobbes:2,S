The put is implicit in the call, since for each dev returned from
pci_get_device_reverse() we then call it with the same dev as the last
('from') parameter. We take a reference to dev elsewhere, just before
we start using it.
In any case these bridges can't be hot-plugged, so as long as the ref
count remains positive, we're fine.
Cheers,
Muli
