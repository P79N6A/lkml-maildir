You've made checkpatch unhappy ;-)
So we don't bother with anonymous only, always attempt the merge.

And here we don't bother merging because that would have been done
before. Assuming ->mmap() doesn't go wild, in which case it ought to
have set a VM_SPECIAL bit anyway to discourage merging.
[ And even if it didn't, failing to merge shouldn't be a problem, as
minimizing the vmas is an optimization, not a strict requirement
afaik. ]
The obvious glaring difference is the vma_policy() cruft. But staring at
the code a bit I can't see how the new vma can have acquired a vm_policy
here, so it ought to not matter.
Looks ok to my eyes, so I guess:
