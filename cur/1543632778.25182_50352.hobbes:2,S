   Ok, how about just keeping it a subsys_initcall, like it was in the first 
   place? 
Then there are ordering problems with subsys_initcalls which want to
add devices to sys_bus.  In fact, arch_initcalls are the places where
most of the actual uses of subsys_bus registry.
So for the ump-teenth time, you need to init this thing EXACTLY after
core_initcalls.  I can only say this so many times, this is the
initcall classification we need to fix this bug, "POST CORE INITCALL"
and "BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE".
One way to do that, for the ump-teenth time, is to rename
unused_initcall to postcore_initcall and use that new initcall
to fix the pci_bus and sys_bus generic bus initialization ordering
problems.
We're talking in circles and the fixes you're proposing are not
going to fix the bug, just create new versions of the old bug.
