2.4.21-rc1 with NCAPINTS==6 hangs at boot in the local
APIC timer calibration step; before that it detected a
0MHz bus clock and the local APIC NMI watchdog was stuck.
Correcting head.S:X86_VENDOR_ID fixes these problems.
Without correcting head.S:X86_VENDOR_ID, head.S will store
the vendor id partly in the capabilities array. This breaks
both the capabilities and the vendor id. I can't say why 2.6
works, but obviously the CPU setup code has changed since 2.4.
BTW, the patch below should be applied to 2.6.
