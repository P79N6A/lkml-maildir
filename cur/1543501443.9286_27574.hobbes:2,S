No flames here. Sounds good to me. The label needing to be attached to
a statement seems true.
	void func()
        {
          goto foo;
          .......;
          .......;
          foo:
        }
     ..... does not work. However
        void func()
        {
         goto foo;
         .......;
         .......;
         foo: return;
        }
     .... does work.
Which is inconsistant because running off the end of a void function
implies a 'return'. -- which means that the label is attached to a
statement in both cases (one implied, one explicit).
