We have the following properties in the character sets we handle:
- every ASCII character is encoded with the same byte as in ASCII
- if the eighth bit is 0, the byte can't be part of a multi-byte character
- no ASCII character can be encoded in a different way
This (plus most likely some other properties I've missed to mention) 
allows some parsing based on ASCII characters.
But if you want to match "one character" (like TOMOYO does) or want to 
check for printable characters except space (like Smack does) you must 
know whether the byte string 0xC3 0xA0 is the character à or a sequence 
of two characters with the second one being NBSP.
