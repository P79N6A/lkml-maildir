these are all the first type of latencies, which seem to be hardware 
related. Could you try to boot the UP kernel, do you see these latencies 
there too? (if yes then please post those too)

the fix is in current -RT kernels already. As can be seen from the 
latency traces you got, the SMT scheduler is not causing latencies 
anymore.
