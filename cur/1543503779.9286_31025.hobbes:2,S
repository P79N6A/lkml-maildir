Thanks. This does indeed seem to prevent the oopses and subsequent system
freezeup. Now I just get into an infinite loop of bus resets. At least now
I can shut my system down safely.
(More info on my problem can be found at
http://kernelnotes.org/lnxlists/linux-kernel/lk_9907_03/msg00969.html
if anyone else is interested in helping me in my predicament :)
Here's the relevent part of the kernel log. In this case, a "mount"
generated several of the timeouts, but then appeared to be successful. The
rest of the errors were generated after a "find ." from the root of the
cdrom.

...the Soviets have the capability to try big projects.  If there is a goal,
such as when Gorbachev states that they are going to have nuclear-powered
aircraft carriers, the case is closed -- that is it.  They will concentrate
on the problem, do a bad job, and later pay the price.  They really don't
care what the price is.
