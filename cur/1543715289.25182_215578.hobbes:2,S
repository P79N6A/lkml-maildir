thanx for ur reply.
if u dont mind u want little more information about the problem.
wht do u mean by legacy floppy drive. if kernel can boot in that why not 
on IDE floppy drive. i think booting process is done by bios program, i 
dont think it depends up on kernel.why i cannot install & boot kernel 
from the compact flash in newer kernels.can u pls give some information 
about this.
