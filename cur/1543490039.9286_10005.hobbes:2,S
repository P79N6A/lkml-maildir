Nope, currently on tunes for PIO via tuneproc.
I am haveing to consider at least three difference chipset tuning
functions for PIIX.  Also determine how to impose speed limits on PIIX3's
with UDMA devices attached.  There is more to all the different
implimentations of these chips.  Most get it right with the BIOS and a few
completely goat-screw the design.
This is the problem that I am finding with the Aladdin V M5229 IDE, also.
