Hi all,
I really think you should try the lastest snapshot. Get via cvs (vger) or:
	<
http://www.pi.se/blox/modutils/modutils-snap990312.tar.gz>
A summary _is_ available in ChangeLog, and as soon as I have the time,
I _will_ update the man pages...
FYI, modprobe now understands a couple of new keywords:
    Files and variables:
	include FILE		(Guess what...)
	define VAR VALUE	(also puts it in the environment)
    Flow control (conditional decoding):
	if EXPRESSION
	else
	elseif EXPRESSION
	endif
		where EXPRESSION can be:
			! EXPRESSION
			-f FILENAME
			WORD	where UNDEF, "", "0" or "false" => FALSE,
				else => TRUE
			WORD op WORD  (op is one of == != < <= >= >= )
		All WORDs are expanded w.r.t. meta-characters
    Additional dependecies (described in the config file):
	above module modulelist		pull in a module on top
					(such as a compressor above ppp)
	below module modulelist		for completness...
Lots of interesting (long) options all over the place and every
reasonable (or even worse) possibility to easily combine apps
with insmod (for ramdisks/floppies...). See: insmod/README.combined
