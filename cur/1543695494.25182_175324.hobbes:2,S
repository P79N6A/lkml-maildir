I was having a simliar problem, except my machine seemed to recover
from the error. With this patch applied, I get a double-fault:
PNPBIOS fault.. attempting recovery.
double fault, gdt at c02bbe20 [255 bytes]
double fault, tss at c031ca00
eip = ca2f9e10, esp = 00000028
eax = 00000000, ebx = ca2f9e0c, ecx = 00000097, edx = c02bf11c
esi = 00000000, edi = c01187f0
Here is how the addresses resolve in /proc/kallsyms:
c02bbe20 is in _etext
c031ca00 is in km_waitq [ipv6]
ca2f9e10 is in __crc_rtc_control [rtc]
ca2f9e0c is in __crc_rtc_control [rtc]
c02bf11c is in __PAGE_KERNEL [agpgart]
c01187f0 is in do_page_fault
