What is that GART thing exactly? Is this the hardware IOMMU? I've always
thought GART was something graphics card related,.. but if so,.. how
could this solve our problem (that seems to occur mainly on harddisks)?

Does this mean that PATA is no related? The corruption appears on PATA
disks to, so why should it only solve the issue at SATA disks? Sounds a
bit strange to me?

Can you explain this a little bit more please? Is this a drawback (like
a performance decrease)? Like under Windows where they never use the
hardware iommu but always do it via software?
Best wishes,
Chris.
