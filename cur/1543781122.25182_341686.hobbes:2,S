Please don't - I have a patch in the wings which fixes this properly.
Unfortunately, its behind a ton of other patches, and I don't want
to try to find all these fixes in each driver.
This is wrong because we will re-initialise it from an indeterminant
state (it might be locked) later during the initialisation.  Let's
fix it properly.
(Since Linus pulled the shutters down when I still had a large chunk
of stuff in my serial tree, my serial patch merging is currently at
a complete standstill.)
