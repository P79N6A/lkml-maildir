The CHANGELOG has never been in the BK files that I submit.  My guess
is that when the driver was last updated, the CHANGELOG file from the
tar distribution was included.  I don't think it should be especially
if the BK files are used for the next update.  In my merges with 2.4.X,
I have maintained file history even when duplicate changes were integrated
via "patch" instead of via BK.
