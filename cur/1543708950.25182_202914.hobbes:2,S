The O(1) Entitlement Based Scheduler places the equivalent restrictions 
on setting task attributes (i.e. shares and caps) as are placed on using 
nice and renice.  I.e. ordinary users can only change settings on their 
own processes and only if the change is more restricting than the 
current setting.  In particular, they cannot increase a task's shares 
only decrease them, they can impose or reduce a cap but not release or 
increase it and they can change a soft cap to a hard cap but cannot 
change a hard cap to a soft cap.
Additionally, only root can change the scheduler's tuning parameters.
I hope this alleviates your concerns,
Peter
