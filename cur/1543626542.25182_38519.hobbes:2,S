That's sort of supprising.

The way you're doing it now, you're sticking it into final image itself
tho, and passing it along.  If you're not going to be able to change the
commandline, why not handle it all in C? eg:
strcpy(cmd_line, CONFIG_CMDLINE);
if ( passed a new commandline )
   strcpy(cmd_line, new_cmdline);
Tho I have to admit I'm not sure where x86 ends up passing the
commandline in now..
