Thanks Jeff for a quick response. Well, it is only because 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/ChangeLog-2.6.18
 mentions 
the following:
    Author: Jeff Garzik <jeff@garzik.org>
    Date:   Wed May 24 01:43:25 2006 -0400
        [libata sata_promise] Add PATA cable detection.
        Original patch from Phillip Jordan <phillip.m.jordan@gmail.com>
        Cleanups and fixes by me.
Does this mean something other than that sata_promise actually provides 
support for PATA or how should I interpret this? Also, with respect to 
the error messages in my previous messages, could you please advise me 
about my options? (e.g., wait for a new kernel, etc.)?
Thanks,
Theo
