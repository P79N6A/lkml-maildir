As far as I can tell, timekeeping_resume is called via class ->resume 
method; and according to comments in sysdev_resume() and 
device_power_up(), they are called with interrupts disabled.
Looking at suspend_enter, irqs *are* disabled at this point.
So it actually looks like something (may be some driver) unconditionally 
enabled irqs in resume path.
I believe the patch should be hold back until this is clarified.
