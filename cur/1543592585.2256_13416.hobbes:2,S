NOTE: I'm not pushing anything out of the atomic context, I'm using
ksoftirqd only to cure the cases that are getting wrong by the fast-path
code.
It fixes the 1/HZ latency with the idle task and it gets right the case
of softirq marked pending again under do_softirq.

Yes, that is what all kernels out there are doing.

Of course almost all the time the processing is not deferred.

The sofitrq could be marked running also from another softirq, it
doesn't need to be an interrupt.

that just happens, I assume you mean you prefer to remove mask &=
~active from do_softirq() internally.
But doing that will hang in irq as soon as a softirq or tasklet or
that marks itself running again in software (and I think this happens
just now in some driver to poll the hardware from atomic context where
you cannot schedule).  Furthmore the softirq is going to take more time
than the irq core itself, so the live lock issue is not so obvious as
you say I think.

softirq is still as light as possible but without ksoftirq the logic is
wrong in some case, and so it can get a seneless 1/HZ latency sometime.
ksofitrqd fixes all those broken cases in a clean manner.
I'd like to know how much it helps on the gigabit benchmarks. For the
100mbit ethernet that I can test locally it is fine.
