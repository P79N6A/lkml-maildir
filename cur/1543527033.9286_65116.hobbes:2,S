I've thought about this since I have the above (more or less) all over
my code. The problem is, I could find no good way to do that macro. I
ended up with something like:
#define for_each_entry(p,tmp,head,type,member)		\
for (tmp = (head)->next;				\
     p = list_entry(tmp,type,member), tmp != (head);	\
     tmp = tmp->next)
struct node {
	int data;
	struct list_head list;
};
struct list_head *queue, *tmp;
struct node *n;
...
for_each_entry(n,tmp,queue,struct node,list)
	printf("%d\n", n->data);
...but I could never remember what order the fields come in. Or you
can leave the list_entry call outside, but then the macro doesn't help
much, just reduces the readability of the code. So no macro for me.

Borislav
