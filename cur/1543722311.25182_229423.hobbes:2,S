Subject: [PATCH] check_region removal - trm290.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/6/22/253

Here's a patch to remove check_region from drivers/ide/pci/trm190.c
As far as I can see this should not make the driver any less safe than it
currently is, but as Guennadi Liakhovetski has pointed out to me
previously, it doesn't look quite safe that the driver tries to access
ports before request_region gets called from ide_hwif_request_regions()
Unfortunately I'm not quite sure how to rework the driver properly to
make sure it's safe (suggestions welcome).
Anyway, this gets us one step closer to being able to get rid of
check_region() completely, and I don't see how it can do any harm. If the
drivers port access is currently broken, then it's no less broken with
this patch and we gain the bennefit of one less warning and one less
check_region user.
Comments on how to fix this up better are welcome as well as comments on
whether or not it's sufficient and safe to just get rid of check_region
without any further changes.
Patch below is against 2.6.7
