Hi Len,

This is great idea! I know that the patch I suggested was "patching the symptom", not really addressing the cause. I didn't really expect it to be used, mostly just to illustrate the problem.

Yes, please send me the patch and I will test it immediately.

Actually, I was just looking for you, and this is my email to one of my friends, who I think won't get it till tomorrow: "The alternative patch I came up with I think is correct, but looks really ugly.  There are like 3 or 4 places where it can be done, maybe someone could give me a hand to decide where to put the fix. Who is actually in charge of the mpparse and things like that I could cc to?"
:)
Thanks,
