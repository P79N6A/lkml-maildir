Just making sure this fix winds up in 2.6.23:
http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/developer/patches/viewpatch.php?id=4454/1
It fixes a regression that occurred between 2.6.20 and 2.6.20-rc1.  Without 
it, qemu-system-arm can't use emulated SCSI drives.  It wasn't in -rc7, and 
the attached patch Works For Me (tm).

ARM Versatile PCI config reads of one byte width have the lowest two<br />
bits of the address cleared and result in reading from a wrong place<br />
in the config space.  This change is to use word size accesses like it is done for halfword reads.
Byte reads are used for retrieving the IRQ number of a PCI device and the problem was not exposed until 2.6.20 because the value read was discarded in drivers/pci/setup-irq.c (recently fixed).
