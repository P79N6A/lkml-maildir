 Okay.

 As far as I read the code, I found that spinlock is only used by the
generic driver, in the
drivers/usb/serial/generic.c:usb_serial_generic_write() function.
 Can we drop the spinlock there and use our new semaphore? Or should we
create a new spinlock just to use there?
 I ask it because the semaphore will be used to serialize open()/close()
operations in the usb-serial driver, is a bit weird to use the same
semaphore in a write() function of other driver.
