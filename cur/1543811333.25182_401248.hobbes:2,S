Appended is a patch against the current -mm.  [It also makes
swsusp_shrink_memory() behave as documented for image_size = 0.
Currently, if it states there's enough free RAM to suspend, it won't bother
to free a single page.]
If anyone please can test it on a machine with less than 128 MB of RAM
and see if it helps suspend there (in particular when X is running), 
and if changing the value of SHRINK_SLEEP to 200 (or more) makes
any difference,  I'll appreciate it very much.
Greetings,
Rafael

Make swsusp_shrink_memory() try harder to free more RAM if necessary or
if the anticipated size of the image is greater than image_size.
