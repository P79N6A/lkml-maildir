One more datapoint: The box boots if I move the zap_low_mappings((0)
in the following way:

iHowever, if I place the zap_low_mappings((0) before the
#define CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC in line 673, it doesn't boot.
Certainly init_apic_mappings() is at fault.  Could that be a reult of a call to
alloc_bootmem_pages()?.
And one more: I have to boot with "noapic".
