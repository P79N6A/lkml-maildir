Ok, so we tried that.  That caused all sorts of havoc, most of which we 
might be able to figure out.  It seems that RedHat's utilities and stuff 
don't get along well with 2.4.24 if all you do is just boot the new 
kernel.  Seems a bunch of other stuff needs to be upgraded.
Also, 'root=LABEL=/' doesn't work anymore in grub.conf, and there seems 
to be no way to enable it.  Is this a RedHat only thing?
In any event, when we managed to get it to boot, it absolutely did NOT 
fix the DMA problem with the KT600.  Trying to enable it with hdparm 
still says "Operation not permitted".  We spend a LOT of time trying to 
make sure we got the kernel configured right with all of the right 
options, etc., but we're still without IDE DMA.
Any further suggestions?
Thanks.
