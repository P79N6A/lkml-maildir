You don't want do do this in SCSI because it is a task of a layer above SCSI.

Again:	this is a task of a layer above SCSI.
	In some cases, where you might refer to medium access level read ahead,
	this is done by implementing tagged SCSI command queueing.

Again: this is a task of a layer above SCSI. See Solaris and FreeBSD as 
examples.
It would help if you first do some homework and read some decent kernel 
sources to understand how a kernel needs to be layered to implement
e.g. Storage/FS/kernel/user interface layering.
Then use e.g. 'iostat' to see how overlapping disk I/O is done.

It looks like you never did metering tests to see what amount of time
is needed to handle the SCSI protocol.
I did many tests when implementing RSCSI. Even when you include TCP/IP
times, the overhead is <= 100 µs per SCSI command.

Not knowing what is bad may make people believe that something is good.

It definitely did not help 4 years ago, when the sg problem did came up.
