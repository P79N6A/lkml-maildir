Hi all,
I'm currently using Linux (2.6.7-rc3) in an embedded system with a 8-port
Sealevel SeaLink 2802 USB device. This is a 8-port RS-232/422 device that
allocates /dev/ttyUSB0 through /dev/ttyUSB7 when plugged in.
If I have a process talking to one of the ports, e.g. 'cat < /dev/ttyUSB0', and
I unplug the USB hub, all ports except ttyUSB0 unregister properly.
Without killing the 'cat' process, plugging the hub back in will make it
allocate /dev/ttyUSB1 through /dev/ttyUSB8, thereby offsetting each USB port#
by 1.
When killing the 'cat' process at this point, the kernel reports:
drivers/usb/serial/ftdi_sio.c: error from flowcontrol urb
drivers/usb/serial/ftdi_sio.c: Error from DTR LOW urb
drivers/usb/serial/ftdi_sio.c: Error from RTS LOW urb
and then unregisters /dev/ttyUSB0.
Is there a way to allow "hotplug" of a USB device to reuse /dev/ttyUSB0
regardless if an application still has that particular tty open?
If not, is there a way I could make the serial subsystem can send an EIO errno
or some other notification when the serial device is disconnected?
Thanks for your help,
  -Byron
