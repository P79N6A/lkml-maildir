Even when this works around it, the problem that the kernel triggers
module loading on /dev/console access stays and needs to be fixed
instead.
It's a pure kernel bug, regardless of how many times Alan likes to
establish non-sensical hotplug rules to prevent this. The next
innocent driver change, like yours is, will run into the same problem.
