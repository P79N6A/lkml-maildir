If your server has a kernel that doesn't support modules, then a trojan hiding
module can't be used.  Modules are easily tampered with and you no more the wise.

Modules are fantastic for workstations, testbeds, machines that change a lot.
Servers are normally a static configuration.  I won't ship a blackbox device to a
customer that allows them to twiddle with things, their curiosity becomes a
maintenance hassle.  I have a product in the lab that uses bttv and I'd really
love to be able to compile it into the kernel.

Tulip works dandy for me, I have no need of changing it and on a remote server
it's not intelligent to remove your networking support and reload it.  The
process may fail and that leaves you dead.

My vcard size is the same or smaller than the average signature.  Using mime, you
have the option of easily filtering vcards.  Signatures aren't as easily
identified for filtering.
