A PS: to this one, clues if you will, to be added to the other info 
I've posted regarding a ClickSmart 310 camera, and the qcam-vc 
drivers.
I built a kernel with usb debugging turned on, which made it work.  
I'd also tried to build v4l into the kernel but that got an error 
exit, so I went back to making it as a module.  So with everything 
V4L related is as modules below.
The difference between the verbose usb debugging on/off apparently 
does something to the timeing.  With the debugging on, it works but 
the dmesg buffer is overrun so I don't get a full report only the 
tail end, and with the debugging turned back off and the kernel 
rebuilt, no other changes, then it fails, with these lines being 
logged in /var/log/dmesg:
--------
vid 0x04B8 pid 0x0005
host/usb-uhci.c: interrupt, status 2, frame# 1641
hub.c: usb_hub_port_status (2) failed (err = -84)
hub.c: connect-debounce failed, port 3 disabled
--------
And the device is not intitialized.
Is this a usefull clue?
