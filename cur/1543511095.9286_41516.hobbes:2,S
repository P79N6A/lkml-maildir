The way I've seen this done (on BSDI boxen, I think) is that the system
does an arp for it's own IP address before/as the interface is brought up.
It it gets a response, it assumes that there is another box out there with
the same IP address (not a BAD assumption).
BSDI is nice about this -- it complains about the duplicate IP address a
few times to the system console, but it still configures the interface and
goes on about its business. I've always liked the way BSDI does this, and
how its ifconfig shows if you have an ethernet carrier (instead have
having to check the back of the system for the link light..if there is
one.).
