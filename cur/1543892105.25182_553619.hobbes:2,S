OK.  It sounds like a healthy dose of comments is in order.  I'll
clean things up and send out a new patch sometime tonight or tomorrow.
Additional comments inline below:

At this point, we've already called setup_arg_pages(), so the user
memory is our own private copy.  No other threads can access it.

No, strnlen_user() returns N+1 (where N==MAX_ARG_STRLEN) if the string
is too large.

If that's the case, then we will fail to copy the null terminator, and
the string will munge into the following string.  Since we always
access this data via the various userspace access routines, we will
either return an error on a later operation, or the new process will
segfault shortly upon starting.

This is correct.  In this case, shift is already populated with a
negative, wrapped unsigned value.  The -shift is needed to make it
positive before the bitwise shift.

We add EXTRA_STACK_VM_PAGES.  To be honest, I think neither of us know
why this is done.  It's just what the old code did, so we preserved
it.
