You have periods of excessive system usage, although DMA is enabled on
the drive. Depending on what transcode does, it might still be using pio
though. Any chance you can profile such a 'sy' peak so we can see what's
going on?
Looks odds, though. I'm inclined to guess this is a CPU scheduler
problem. Does booting with elevator=deadline change anything at all?
