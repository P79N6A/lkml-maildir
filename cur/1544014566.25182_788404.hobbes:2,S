To my knowledge the inliner is already fixed. We're just talking about 
old gccs.
Also to be honest I never quite believed in the basic idea of
"hurt users to get someone else to do something" strategies like
you're advocating here.

Not inlining bitops qualifies as the later I believe. 
I agree with you if we're talking about random static function
in .c files, but widely used functions in .h files that are 
not expected to change are a little different. The main
reason to not use __always_inline normally is that when people
change the function to contain more code they typically don't 
drop these markers and then it eventually leads to bloat.
But for the bitops style functions I changed here it's not really
expected that they change this way.
Also I don't think adding a few __always_inline for functions which
really need it will hurt maintainability or anything else. In fact
we already have them in a couple of places (e.g. uaccess.h)

That's true, I just reacted to Hugh's report. I don't use old
compilers on my own.
