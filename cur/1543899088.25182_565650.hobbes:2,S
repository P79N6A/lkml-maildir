You can't catch/block SIGKILL (9), but you can catch SIGTERM (15 -
what kill sends by default).
A well behaved app should catch SIGTERM and do proper cleanup before
shutdown so that when a user does  kill <pid_of_app>  it shuts down
cleanly.  kill -9 <pid_of_app> shouldn't normally be needed - it is
for emergency termination of the app, which is why you can't catch it.
