Hi,
While looking at the atomic_t definition for i386, I found the fact that
"counter" isn't volatile is rather strange. Especially since a
volatile_read() doesn't add the "volatile" which would make the (probably
bogus example):
while (atomic_read(&atom_var));
dangerous as gcc might optimize it into registers... [1]
Granted, the example is probably not a good one, but I hope it shows the
problem.
Stranger things might happen if the variable is also modified from
interrupt-context... as there is nothing that stops gcc from optimizing
the variable in the the non-interrupt code into registers.
The patch below will make the counter always volatile; it seems to be the
correct thing to do.
Greetings,
   Arjan van de Ven
[1] No doubt the crusoe will handle this nicely
