Only if you can demonstrate any real-world scenario where 
init will be chosen with the current algorithm.
The "3 MB init on 4MB machine" kind of theoretical argument
just isn't convincing if nobody can show that there is a
problem in reality.

The nice flag has been removed from my current kernel tree.
The CPU time used, however, is a different matter. You really
don't want to have the OOM killer kill your 6-week-old running
simulation because a newly started netscape explodes ...

Quoting from mm/oom_kill.c:
/**
 * oom_badness - calculate a numeric value for how bad this task has been
 * @p: task struct of which task we should calculate
 *
 * The formula used is relatively simple and documented inline in the
 * function. The main rationale is that we want to select a good task
 * to kill when we run out of memory.
 *
 * Good in this context means that:
 * 1) we lose the minimum amount of work done
 * 2) we recover a large amount of memory
 * 3) we don't kill anything innocent of eating tons of memory
 * 4) we want to kill the minimum amount of processes (one)
 * 5) we try to kill the process the user expects us to kill, this
 *    algorithm has been meticulously tuned to meet the priniciple
 *    of least surprise ... (be careful when you change it)
 */
Do you have any additional requirements?
regards,
Rik
