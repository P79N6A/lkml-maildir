Yeah.  They were already outdated in the sense that they did not specify 
that the interleave nodemask could change as a result of a cpuset mems 
change.

Good question.

Well, sure, but mempolicy's already get overridden by cpusets anyway.  For 
example, if you were to attach a task with an MPOL_BIND mempolicy to a 
cpuset with a disjoint set of allowed mems.
The important distinction is that you can still interleave over a subset 
of the mems_allowed if you set your memory policy after being attached to 
the cpuset.

No, because that would negate the above.  We still want to be able to 
restrict interleaved memory policies to a subset of allowed mems.  This 
option gives the most power to applications.

I think that documenting the change in the man page as saying that "the 
nodemask will include all allowed nodes if the mems_allowed of a 
memory_spread_user cpuset is expanded" is better.
I've got a few fixes for my patchset queued so I'll resend it later; it's 
mostly style changes but there is a subtle bug where the task changing the 
value of a cpuset's memory_spread_page is not in the same cpuset.
