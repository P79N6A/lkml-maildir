+2+sys+power+state+pcmcia
Thanks, but recall that that is PCMCIA. The point of the patch was to pass
the value to the bus drivers, so that they could decide what were valid
values. In the case of PCMCIA, they had adapted to "2", so they could
still receive "2", if the user process wrote that..
Thanks,
