Hmmmm.. The issue is really in krealloc which can be called with a NULL
parameter (a special case). However, krealloc should not call ksize
with NULL.
The merged patch above makes ksize(NULL) return 0. So we are
returning zero size for an object that we have not allocated.
Better fail if someone tries that.
The __do_kmalloc issue looks like a hunk that was somehow dropped.
IMHO: The right fix for the ksize issue would be the following patch:
