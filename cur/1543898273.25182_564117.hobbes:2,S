But that isn't the kernel you reported the error against. You reported
that 2.6.22-rc5-g75154f40-*dirty* had the error, which means there was
a diff between what you were building and what was in the repository.
If you know what the diff was and it was something trivial, then you
can disregard this bit of pedantry, but if not, try to recall if you
had something else patched against that.
Regardless, as it's not reproducible it sounds like the report should
be closed...
