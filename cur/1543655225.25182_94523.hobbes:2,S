Nono, these are _old_ machines, probably stopped production round about
1995 or so.  We mentioned these briefly back in the original days of
the pci_alloc_consistent interface discussions.  These machines cannot
allocate uncached memory, nor can the peripherals snoop the CPU's cache
(or vice versa).  As I indicated to Adam, there's a fairly limited range
of devices available for these systems and there shouldn't be a huge
problem converting the few drivers we need to these interfaces.
