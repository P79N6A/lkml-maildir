Nope. The lspci output looks perfectly normal. I looks like a mixture of
issues with BM DMA being disabled for a reason I haven't figured out and
then the code crashing because it doesn't like BM-DMA being disabled ...
Again, best is you pour printk's all over setup-pci.c and ide-dma.c to
figure out what's going on...
