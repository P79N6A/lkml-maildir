Now there is a bug opened up at redhat:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=229227
I've ran into this info:
http://www.lavrsen.dk/twiki/bin/view/PWC/FrequentlyAskedQuestionsPWC#modprobe_fails_with_FATAL_Error
and did removed the index=X line associated with the pwc driver.  This still create a problem from time to time.
Seems like the index=X option is broken in the alsa driver (or maybie deprecated, remove, buggy, duno?). There is another way to fix the problem by using a /etc/asound.conf file (see 
http://alsa.opensrc.org/FAQ026
) and removing the index=X entries from your mdoprobe.conf file
Maybie the Fedora team should use the asound.conf configuration instead?
