Special files and fops really only work well if you can coerce the
interface into one where data flows predominantly one way.  I don't
think they work so well for something that is more like an RPC across
the user/kernel barrier.  For that a system call is better.
For instance, if you have something that kind-of looks like
	read_pmds(int n, int *pmd_numbers, u64 *pmd_values);
where the caller supplies an array of PMD numbers and the function
returns their values (and you want that reading to be done atomically
in some sense), how would you do that using special files and fops?

Why?  What's inherently offensive about system calls?
