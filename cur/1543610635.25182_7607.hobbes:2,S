AFAIK, ext3 was introduced to the kernel in 2.4.15, which is currently the 
latest, and also happens to have a bug which can ruin your filesystem.. i.e. 
dont use it. Your current kernel has ext3 support because redhat has patched 
your kernel with it (and numerous other patches). As far as upgrading kernels 
go, if your current one is fine, and you dont have any real need for features 
in a later one, then stick with your current one. If you do want to upgrade, 
2.4.13 is the latest kernel without any major bugs. It doesnt have ext3 
support but you can download a patch. ext3 is virtually the same as ext2 
anyway- a kernel with ext2 support will happily read and write ext3 without 
any problems, you just wont have journaling support.
You can also download a kernel RPM. the latest one released by redhat is 
2.4.13, and it is pretty much guaranteed to work with your current system and 
not break anything. It is also be patched with ext3 support.
