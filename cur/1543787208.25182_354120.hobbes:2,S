Hi,
does linux support binaries with code
for several architectures? I read that
elf allowes that, and for example
apple plans to use it on mac os X,
but I couldn't find anything whether
such binaries would work with linux
or not. can you tell me?
if linux supports that, it should
also work for merging x86 and x86_64
into one binary? would ther be a way
to run the 32bit version in the 64bit
kernel, if requested? are there any
tools to create such binaries?
with google I found info from 97
that indicades elf format has no
provision for fat binaries and linux
doesn't support them. is that still
true?
Thanks, Andreas
