Indeed the entire set might be able to benefit wrt to pid
virtualization. I think we are quite open to embrace a larger set of
applications of pid virtualization.

Not being to alien to the CKRM concept, yes there is some nice synergy 
here. As well as to PAGG and SGI's jobs. CKRM provides resource
constraints and runtime enforcements based on some grouping of
processes. Similar to container, class membership is inherited (if
that's still the case from last time I looked at it) until explicitely
changed. Containers and in particular provide another dimension
namely the ability to constraint "visibility" of resources and objects,
in this particular case pids as the first resource used.
