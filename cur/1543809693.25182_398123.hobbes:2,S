Possible. Because when the migration thread runs it moves the current running
task out of the processor and the checks in can_migrate_task() like
"sd->nr_balance_failed > sd->cache_nice_tries" can result in cache hot task
move to the idle package.. This is a round about way and we should not depend
on this behavior..

active load balance is designed only with HT optimizations in mind. And now
multi-core optimizations also use this active load balance. No one else uses
active load balance.
