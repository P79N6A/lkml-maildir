Well, I figured the change from -mm2 to -mm3 was responsible, as I have
never seen the VP patches make a perceptible difference in system
response time.  The VP effect only becomes apparent when you do
something that really needs millisecond or sub-ms latency.  I guess a
bug in the VP patch could cause performance regressions though.  However
no one reported sluggishness with mm2+S7, but it's apparent when you try
mm3+T3 that it feels a lot more responsive.
Anyway I was just wondering if there was an obvious change that would
cause this.
