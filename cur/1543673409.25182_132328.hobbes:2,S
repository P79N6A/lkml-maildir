Hi.
I want to submit the ARM26 architecture. its still broken, but its
getting there. now a couple more people want to hack on it, so I'd
appreciate it if you could put the non-invasive parts into the kernel
tree for me.
I have two patches - one to add arch/arm26 and another to add the
corresponding incluse/asm-arm26
will you accept them?
