Okay, let's take a look at the case where I have 64 connections open: if 
I'm using a 64 entry hash table with one 4 byte pointer per entry and 
perfect hashing, then it has a cache footprint of 256 bytes.  Max.  Now, 
the same hash table blown up to 4MB is going to have a cache footprint 
of 64 bytes (1 cache line) per entry, for a total of a 4KB cache footprint.
Which is better?

Don't AssUMe that I don't realise this.  What I'm saying is that a 4MB hash 
table for a system with a puny number of connections is bloat.  Needless 
bloat.  4MB is enough memory for a copy of gcc.  Or enough to run 4 shells.  
If the hash table was grown dynamically, I wouldn't have this complaint.
