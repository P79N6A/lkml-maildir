Ok, time to warm up this old chestnut. I "solved" my immediate problem
with wbsd, and this got forgotten. AFAICT, mmci.c and the rest of the
lot are still broken in the sense that they use kmap but exceed page
limits (which happens to work on non-highmem pages).
I think the right solution is to let them use page_address() instead.
Would that be correct?
