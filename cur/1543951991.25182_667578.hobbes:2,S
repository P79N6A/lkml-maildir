Subject: linux-next20080314 build fails with !CONFIG_PM
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The next-20080314 tree build fails 
drivers/serial/serial_core.c: In function `uart_add_one_port':
drivers/serial/serial_core.c:2359: error: invalid lvalue in assignment
make[2]: *** [drivers/serial/serial_core.o] Error 1
The config # CONFIG_PM was not set.The code which is causing the 
build failure is 
	device_can_wakeup(tty_dev) = 1;
when the CONFIG_PM is set the macro is preprocessed as
#define device_can_wakeup(dev) \
        ((dev)->power.can_wakeup)
and when not set, it becomes 0 = 1 
#define device_can_wakeup(dev)                  0
