At least this is what the 1st generation PowerBook G4 does.  I don't
know if other PPC_PMAC are affected.
I suggest we explicitly switch cable power on in .resume() but also
explicitly switch cable power off in .suspend(), so that we don't get
any surprises. (Hardware bugs related to these platform features
excepted.)  Patches follow:
 1/4 firewire: fw-ohci: switch on bus power after resume on PPC PMac
 2/4 firewire: fw-ohci: refactor probe, remove, suspend, resume
 3/4 ieee1394: ohci1394: switch on bus power after resume on PPC PMac
 4/4 ieee1394: ohci1394: refactor probe, remove, suspend, resume
