Could you make a man-pages-latest symlink in the download directory?
I'm trying to keep an HTML copy of this (converted with doclifter) up to date 
(It'll be on 
http://kernel.org/doc
 after OLS but right now it's just at 
http://landley.net/kdocs/xmlman
 and yes I know the symlinks are screwed up, 
and there are inappropriate UTF-8 squigglies without the accompanying code 
page declaration.  Doclifter bugs, I'm working on it...)
Anyway, I only intermittently spot these notices going by on the list.  
Something I could check from a cron job would be nicer...
Thanks,
Rob
