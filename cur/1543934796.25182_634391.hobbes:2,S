If you look a bit more you will see two functions named
profile_hits.
So you just add the export twice - like this:
diff --git a/kernel/profile.c b/kernel/profile.c

Which has the added benefit that it is now documented for
both implementations that they are exported.

Stick the prototype in profile.h maybe?
I can see that not all implementers of this function
includes profile.h so it is not foolproof.
