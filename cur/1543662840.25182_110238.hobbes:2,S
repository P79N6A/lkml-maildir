I'm still missing a single good argument for the current SVN being
"bad code" aside from Al Viros' lovecraftian comparisation which seem
to be universal accepted (I got some mails citing or even using this
comparisation to prove that SVN is "inferior"). The Apache Foundation
e.g. is planning to move most of its projects to SVN from CVS in the
near future. And all of these people on infrastructure@ can't be that
clueless...
