Exec loaded kernel for jumping back is also different from exec loaded
kernel normally.
Maybe the two reboot operations in kexec jump can be seen as "jump to"
and "jump back"?

Yes.

This kernel parameter will be added to kernel command line by
kexec-tools automatically.
I will add corresponding document in next version.
