C-1 "worthwhile addition..." Probably shouldn't be part of this.  That's
what additional Signed off by ACK's provide.  I think reviewed by should
limit its scope to code correctness leaving the subjective "worthwhile"
statements are better expressed with other tags.

I think this is a good thing to have, although recruiting reviews remains
an open issue.
I think it would be easier to recruit patch testers than reviewers
should a Tested-by: tag be considered as well?
