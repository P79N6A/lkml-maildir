Andrew:
I propose that we remove this patch from the -mm tree. We will work on a
clean solution and send a patch soon. Please see further discussion on
this under the subject "2.6.9-rc2-mm4 e100 enable_irq unbalanced from"

OK, that patch didn't really work terribly well - the interrupt still
happens.  I've changed it to simply disable the interrupt during e100_up
(), which does seem to work properly.

On resume, the e100 chip seems to raise an interrupt during chip reset.
Since there's no IRQ handler registered yet, the kernel complains that
"nobody cared" about the interrupt.  This change disables the IRQ during
e100_up(), while the hardware is being (re-)initialized.
