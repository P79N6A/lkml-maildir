Intel PIIXn chipsets support (EXPERIMENTAL)
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PIIX
Enable this option..........
I had that "Abit BX6-r2" board in my head during the design of this

I would like a copy of your current pci-config space and with the latest
"kilo" patch.
hexdump /proc/bus/pci/00/07.1 > piix4.hotel
hexdump /proc/bus/pci/00/07.1 > piix4.kilo
You may get a "set_geometry_intr" error/hiccup but that is okay.
I suspect that you will not since the BIOS needs to be educated during
