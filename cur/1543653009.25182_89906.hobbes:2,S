That's really a matter of taste... a lot of Linux hackers seem to enjoy 
retrocomputing and keeping old things around just in case.  Just in case 
somebody sees you post, for example, and gets motivated to fix IOmega 
Buz :)  Some things do get removed though, every now and then.
We have CONFIG_OBSOLETE as a pseudo-config option around which we may 
deprecate drivers.  If a major version or two passes with no one 
complaining, we can remove the driver then...
