I don't know about uncommon, given that I have six machines in this 
building with three way RAID-1 for the boot partition, to be sure I can 
get off the ground enough to get the other partitions up.
And since you added "write-mostly" for remote mirrors I do have a few 
systems doing >2 mirrors as well. This set of patches definitely will be 
in my kernel by this afternoon.
