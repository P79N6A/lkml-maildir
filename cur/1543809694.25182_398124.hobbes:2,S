Hardly "fixed in stone."  I checked before making the suggestion to
change it, the topology sysfs entries are only in 2.6.16-rc kernels, so
they've never been released in an official mainline kernel.  Fixed in
clay that hasn't been fired yet, perhaps.  Maybe by -rc3 it's already
baking in the kiln, but its still changeable.

Now is hardly the time to worry about efficiency in sysfs.  It's already
a maze of twisty symlinks.  And the whole rationale of sysfs is easy
shell-tool access to kernel data about the system.

Nice frontends processing efficient but hard to read data would be best
implemented in binary through netlink or system calls where there would
be no need to format to text, create an inode, then have userspace open
directories, follow links, open a file, read it, parse it BACK into
binary, etc.  
So obviously efficiency isn't a primary sysfs consideration.  That would
leave ... ease of use? :-)
Your two objections aren't convincing to me, but I don't suppose it
matters since I don't have a major interest in the topology code or how
it works.  So continue on!  It was only a helpful suggestion.
