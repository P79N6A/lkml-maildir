Yes.

However, we don't know which consoles are safe to stay alive during suspend.
Generally, defaulting to suspending them all is not a bad idea IMHO.
And IIRC it is plain luck if a serial console survives the suspend (or was
the serial code fixed recently?)
So i do not care too much, but my / Frank's patch was shorter :-) and safer.
