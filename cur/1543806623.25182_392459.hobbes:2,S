That also fails. Same error message.
Unlike the nfsroot code at least my version of mount
does not use nfs version 2 as the default. I had to force
a v2 nfs mount attempt with mount -o nfsvers=2 ...
Would it be a good idea to change the default nfs version
nfsroot uses? I think nfsroot and mount defaults should
be identical.
BTW: Google shows some related old threads, e.g. "Madhan" writes on
2 Aug. 2001 06:55  "There has been a change in the NFS Client
behaviour in Linux Kernel  2.4.3 onwards.  There are 2 issues here,
1. as traces show new clients expect link count '1' and NetWare
NFS has  been sending '0' for volumes. ..."
cu,
 Knut
