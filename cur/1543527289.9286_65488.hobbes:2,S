I totally agree with you.
Maybe yeah, it's more keystrokes. Yeah, code looks larger'n'stuff.
But what matters in big projects such as the linux-kernel; it must be as
maintainable as possible! So any codingstyle that makes things more
readable/
less prone to errors should be encouraged.
In my opinion, the kernel is also rather under-documented, so
to say.
