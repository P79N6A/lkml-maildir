On a side note, what happens if say 32bits were implemented (as it's
currently IIRC 16 bit.  8bit major 8bit minor) as 12bit:20bit and you have
an older nfs client (say about .2 or .4 kernel versions prior.  I'm talking
minor kernel version, not patch) looking in /dev on the server?  I use on
occasion, /dev/dsp off a server (this is the way I have a game setup that
runs entirely over nfs)
What would happen, would the nfs server realize it has an old client and
mask the major/minor?
