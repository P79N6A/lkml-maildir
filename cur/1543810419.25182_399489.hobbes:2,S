Well, we already have perfectly good code to free pagecache.

That's okay. Imagine 
"cat /proc/vm/pagecache-contents > /tmp/delme" just before suspend and
"cat /tmp/delme | prefetcher" just after it. Prefetcher is actually
simple app that reads specified pages, then discards them. It can
actually be done in userspace around regular swsusp/uswsusp/suspend2
with no impact on it.
