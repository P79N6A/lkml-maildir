Subject: clarity on kref needed.

Dear All,
I have gone through kref and am planning to implement then in my usb driver.
please terminate my misconceptions if any by correcting the statements below.
In the call below:
kref_init(&dev->kref);
	sets the refcount in the kref to 1.
kref_put(&dev->kref);
	increment the refcount.
kref_put(&dev->kref, mem_release );
What I understand is when the refcount falls back to '1', only then the mem_release() function will be called.
Is it correct? I mean, when is the mem_release () called i.e. when the refcount is '0' or '1'.
Thanks & Regards,
Mukund Jampala
