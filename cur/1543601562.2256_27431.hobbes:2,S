Two other data points:
Desktop PC (Asus P5A motherboard, AMD K6/333) and Happy Hacking Lite
keyboard: only Alt-SysRQ-[sm] work, all other don't (unmount, off, and
reboot not tested, though). Kernel is 2.4.9-ac10.
LART StrongARM SA1100 board, serial console (sa1100 driver), kernel
2.4.9-ac9-rmk1-np1 (latest stable release for StrongARM machines):
everything works.
The evidence with the ARM board points in the direction of the keyboard
driver. I don't have a null modem cable right here so I can't test the
desktop with a serial console, but that would also give an interesting
data point.

PS: my laptop also runs 2.4.9-ac10
