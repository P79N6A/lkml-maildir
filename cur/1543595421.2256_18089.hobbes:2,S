Could it be smbfs? The following piece of code from smb_writepage
looks like it could return with the page locked:
      static int
      smb_writepage(struct page *page)
      {
	      /*   ....    */
	      /* easy case */
	      if (page->index < end_index)
		      goto do_it;
	      /* things got complicated... */
	      offset = inode->i_size & (PAGE_CACHE_SIZE-1);
	      /* OK, are we completely out? */
	      if (page->index >= end_index+1 || !offset)
		      return -EIO;           <=====   This looks bad!
      do_it:
	      get_page(page);
	      err = smb_writepage_sync(inode, page, 0, offset);
	      SetPageUptodate(page);
	      UnlockPage(page);
	      put_page(page);
	      return err;
      }
