Rene,
    Of the uni-processor systems currently that can run Linux, I would not
    doubt if  99.9999% percent are uni-cores. It will be probably
    3-5 years minimum before the multi-core processors will have any
    decent percentage of systems.
    And I am not suggesting not supporting them. I am only suggesting
   is wrt the schedular, bring the system up with a default schedular,
   and then load additional functionality based on the hardware/software
    requirements of the system.
    Thus, the fallout MIGHT be a uni-processor CFS that would not migrate
    tasks between multiple CPUs and as additional processors are brought
    online, migration could be enabled, and gang type scheduling,  whatever
    could be then used.
    IMO, if their is a fault (because of heat, etc) the user would rather
bring
    up the system in a degraded mode. Same reason applies to...
    boot -s..
