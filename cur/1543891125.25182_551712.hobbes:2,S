We end up with this:
	/* find a device that is not in use. */
	if (!idr_pre_get(&allocated_ptys, GFP_KERNEL))
		return -ENOMEM;
	spin_lock(&allocated_ptys_lock);
	idr_ret = idr_get_new(&allocated_ptys, NULL, &index);
	if (idr_ret < 0) {
		spin_unlock(&allocated_ptys_lock);
		if (idr_ret == -EAGAIN)
			return -ENOMEM;
		return -EIO;
	}
	if (index >= pty_limit) {
		idr_remove(&allocated_ptys, index);
		spin_unlock(&allocated_ptys_lock);
		return -EIO;
	}
	spin_unlock(&allocated_ptys_lock);
this leaves a small window in which another thread can come in and steal
away the idr tree's reserves, causing the idr_get_new() to fail.  It's
highly improbable, but it's real.
Hence I think a straight semaphore->mutex conversion would be better.
The IDR API absolutely blows chunks: it should require caller-provided
locking, like radix-tree.  But then it'd need gunk like radix_tree_preload
to be reliable.  Fact is, storage librares which need to allocate memory at
insert-time are always going to be problematic in-kernel.
