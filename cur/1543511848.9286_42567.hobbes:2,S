Subject: [patch] replacing "/dev/root" in /proc/mounts
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

There seems to currently be no mechanism (at least none I am aware of)
from user space to determine what the root device name _really_ is. The
kernel knows what the kdev_t for the root filesystem's device is, but
it apparently has no method of sharing that knowledge with userspace.
This patch lets /proc/mounts tell userspace the major/minor number of
the root filesystem. The patch applies to both 2.3.18 and 2.2.12.
some background:
I'm working on some _very_ stripped down utils for embedded systems, and
so I wanted to use /proc/mounts instead of making my own /etc/mtab file
<rant>and why do folks put mtab in /etc instead of /var? </rant>
Anyway, I noticed the following
    [andersen@dillweed andersen]$ cat /proc/mounts
    /dev/root / ext2 rw 0 0
    proc /proc proc rw 0 0
It claims the root device is /dev/root. Ugh, at reboot time, you can't
remount /dev/root ro (since there isn't really a /dev/root), so you
can't get a clean reboot.
So I looked through the source and found the spot in
/usr/src/linux/fs/super.c where folks stuck the "/dev/root" kludge,
and realised they did this since the kernel doesn't have a real
/dev/<something> name for the root device (since the root filesystem
isn't yet mounted that makes sense). The kernel _does_ know the root
filesystem's device major and minor number, so it seems like a more
reasonable entry would be kdevname(ROOT_DEV), which can then be parsed
from user space and used to umount /.
So, unless somebody knows of another way to find out from user space
what the root filesystem's device name is, I propose the following
patch. With this in place, you can get results which allow you to find
the root filesystem's device, i.e:
    [andersen@dillweed src]$ cat /proc/mounts
    ide0(3,3) / ext2 rw 0 0
    proc /proc proc rw 0 0
