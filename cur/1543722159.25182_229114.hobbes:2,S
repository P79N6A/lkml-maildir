This happens with many gcc-3.x versions, not just gcc-3.4.
In any case, it doesn't prevent a successful kernel build.

This is HIGHMEM which I never tested before. The problem is yet
another FASTCALL/fastcall discrepancy where a function's definition
doesn't have the exact same attributes as its prototype.
My updated gcc340 patch fixes this problem. Get
<

or simply apply the patch below on top of the previous version.
