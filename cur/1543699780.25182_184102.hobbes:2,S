agreed. Patch without these changes reverted is attached. (this is pretty
close to your last patch.)
just one nit wrt. the first micro-optimization:
> So setting variables earlier tends to actually pessimize code [...]
in this specific case the critical section only sets the variable, and the
lifetime of the variable necessiates a stackslot anyway, on x86. So moving
the initialization outside the lock shouldnt pessimise the generated code,
in fact it could even free up a register, due to the compiler being able
to do:
  movl $1, 0x12(%esp)
due to the clear register spill, instead of using up a register due to the
initialization being too close to the setting to 1.
But i agree, due to worse readability alone it is not worth having this
change. And on non-x86 it could even result in a spilled register.
(the nonlinear code at the end of the function was clearly a bad idea.)
