You're correct. While this eliminates the possibility of getting
random values from the stack, it still leaves space for letting
previous unwanted values unchanged.
Unless, of course, the structure in question is kcalloc()'d (which is
not the case of gdev in the beginning of the patch - I haven't had the
time to check the other cases). But we surely can't rely on that.

I can't see the semantic change.

Yes. Since the code can't be depend on the caller passing a zeroed
structure, it's definitely more safe to memset to 0 (or use kcalloc(),
instead of kmalloc(), when the allocation is the routine's own
responsability).
Changing subjects a little bit: where's the stack overflow in the
code? Either I'm too stupid to find it myself by looking at the patch
or the e-mail is mistitled.
