I just thought of another solution, which actually seems cleaner and has 
less impact on the top-level (generic) Makefile.
Let's just do the 
	LDFLAGS_vmlinux := -T arch/$(ARCH)/vmlinux.lds.s
before including arch/$(ARCH)/Makefile.
Normal archs can then just do
	LDFLAGS_vmlinux += -extra_option
while UML does
	LDFLAGS_vmlinux := -r
The actual executable UML generates is called "linux" anyway, so its 
Makefile can have its own rule (as for other archs the boot images) which 
builds "linux" from "vmlinux" using gcc and the link script. - I.e. the 
same way as UML used to do it earlier, anyway.
The only impact on generic code is basically
s/LDFLAGS_vmlinux :=/LDFLAGS_vmlinux +=/
in arch/*/Makefile, and it makes the UML "linux" build conceptually 
similar to other archs' "bzImage" or whatever targets.
What do you think?
