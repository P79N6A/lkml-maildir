Thanks for that readme, now I discovered git remote, which is not
mentioned often enough for some reason.
A lot changed indeed, most importantly the race that I hit is
fixed in tip by improved locking. Replace ring_buffer_consume()
and ring_buffer_peek() with ring_buffer_get_event() or not is
just a matter of taste now. Are you still interested in such a
patch?
(34 EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPLs in ring_buffer.c seems a bit excessive though.)
Greetings,
Indan
