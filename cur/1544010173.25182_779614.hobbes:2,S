I was going to apply these but
a) It's nine patches all with the same title and I can't be bothered
   thinking up useful titles for each one.  See
   Documentation/SubmittingPatches
b) I can't find all the patches on lkml.
c) Why am I applying misdn patches anyway?  If someone else already
   applied them then they aren't in linux-next.
