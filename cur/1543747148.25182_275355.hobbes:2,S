1 - not really
2 - details please:
    - which kernel versions have been tested ?
    - when did the bahavior appear first ?
    - which compiler version ?
    - can you provide a short description of the hardware ?
    - lspci -vx, lsmod, dmesg after boot, /proc/interrupts, vmstat 1
      for a few seconds when ok/nok will be welcome
3 - can it be reproduced with latest -bk ?
