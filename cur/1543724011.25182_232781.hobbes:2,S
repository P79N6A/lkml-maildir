You've changed the wrong define.  Bump MAX_HWIFS in <asm/ide.h> instead.

- there are no more major numbers assigned for IDE
- for majority people of people it is enough
- IDE driver uses static data structures so higher number of interfaces
  means more memory wasted (if you don't use all of them of course)
- nobody cared
