Historically hackers were not too good at raising funds.
Maybe we should use stuff which we are good at? Forcedeth
is a nice precedent. 2d and especially 3d engines
may be significantly harder to reverse engineer,
but people can scale rather nicely, as kernel development shows. ;)
Then write specs from gained knowledge and put it on a web page.
IIRC reverese engineering for driver development is legal
in most countries.
If ATI/NVidia will sue Linux on this, then server-oriented companies
(RedHat, IBM, ...) probably could provide defence.
