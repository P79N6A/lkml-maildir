Very interesting idea. But not correct.
The reason is code rot(*). You have never to stop maintaining and patching
and fixing the code to keep it working. A perfectly good and clean code,
if you don't touch it, becomes crusty and smelly over time(**). This is why
the number of patches daily entering the kernel is actually a sign of good
overall code quality. ;)

(**)
	One of the reasons for this is that the hardware changes over
	time. Another is that the requirements of what it is expected to
	do change over time. And yet another is that due to the above
	changes the rest of the code gets updated and the parts that
	were not touched do not interoperate properly any more.
Huh. And now I'll be getting all the e-mails following in this thread.
