My point is that the SATA subsystem is a very different case from 
device-mapper.
The SATA subsystem provides _hardware_ knowledge, it provides the ability 
for certain very popular devices to work, and improved functionality
for devices which could be driven by the IDE subsystem.
Now the device mapper can be thought of as a high-level abstraction in which 
LVM, RAID, and other functionality can be built on top of. We already have 
those in v2.4. 
They are quite different.
