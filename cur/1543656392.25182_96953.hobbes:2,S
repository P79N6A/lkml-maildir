Ok that's reasonable.
My belief is that S4bios is a stopgap measure until S4 gets better. That
said, I think you are right - it should go in for now, and then at some
point in the future someone will say, "S4bios?? who needs *that* anymore??"
and it will get pulled out. ;-)
So I'll look to merge it, unless someone upstream beats me to it.
