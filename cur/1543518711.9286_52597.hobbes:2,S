  Care to elaborate why?  Or are you only referring to when the driver is
attempting s/w mixing.

  I'd have thought you'd want to be able to open the soundcard as many
times as you want and 'grab' a subset of the available channels.
  The only other approach would be to allow one open,  export all channels,
and then have a super-esd that subsequently re-exports to apps.
