I don't think I got that one. How many disks would you use, and
how would you distribute the above fields across the disks? If
you put each column on a disk you can handle any two lost
blocks, but not two lost disks. Or would you use a total of 15
disks? Or do you have some way of placing them on 5 disks with
3 blocks on each disk?
