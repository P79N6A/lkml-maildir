I ran into this as well under various kernels including 2.4.18.  Try
adding:
    append="idebus=50"
to the lilo stanza for your kernel.
It seems even after I amputated the offending "write" that causes the
lockup, the bus speed was being set to 33MHz instead of 50Mhz.  The
above solved the problem for me.
I don't need to specifically set idebus in the 2.5.7 version of the
driver so I assume something has been corrected in more recent
releases.
For anyone else trying to configure the pcg-c1mrx or pcg-c1mv, I'm
updating linux configuration document as I work through the
setup of the various devices:
