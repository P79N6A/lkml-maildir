I'll fold the patch in anyway, maybe set to pio by default

Given it seems its an SI chip I suspect SI are the right people here
if we need to bug someone. I would be very suprised if this is anything
but an SI3112. Its expensive to fab a chip so you dont fab special ones
for people. You might print a different logo or change the PCI ID in
the external serial eeprom but no more.
