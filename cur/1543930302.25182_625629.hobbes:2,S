It looks like pata_pcmcia is always PIO mode 0:
/**
  *	pcmcia_init_one		-	attach a PCMCIA interface
  *	@pdev: pcmcia device
  *
  *	Register a PCMCIA IDE interface. Such interfaces are PIO 0 and
  *	shared IRQ.
  */
I assume that with old IDE this would use ide_cs.c, but I'm drawing a 
blank on what modes that supports..
