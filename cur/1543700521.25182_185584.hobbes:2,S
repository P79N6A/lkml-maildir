Hi,
with 2.6.0 kernel, I have some troubles with sidewinder support.
It works perfectly, but when using it, the kernel log is fullfilled by
messages like these:
sidewinder.c: Read 5 triplets. [77773]
sidewinder.c: Read 5 triplets. [77773]
so dmesg command it's useless.
With the attached patch the SWDEBUG is removed and the messages aren't
printed.
