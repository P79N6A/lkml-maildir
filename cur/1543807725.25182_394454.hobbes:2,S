The only problem is that we compile with -ffreestanding which implies 
-fno-builtin, so just declaring them as normal externs is not enough and 
you have to something like this:
#define __HAVE_ARCH_MEMSET
extern void *memset(void *, int, __kernel_size_t);
#define memset(d, c, n) __builtin_memset(d, c, n)
(BTW you do this already in x86-64.)
Another problem here is because of -fno-builtin it's not easy to use the 
generic functions as fallback. x86-64 basically does this: 
#define strlen __builtin_strlen
size_t strlen(const char * s);
#ifndef __HAVE_ARCH_STRLEN
extern __kernel_size_t strlen(const char *);
#endif
This means you define a prototype for the builtin function and not for the 
normal function. I'm not sure this is really intended.
bye, Roman
