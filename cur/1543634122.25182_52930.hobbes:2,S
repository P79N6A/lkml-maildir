In case you just add controllers, you just need to make sure you get them the
same numbers again. A solution for this exists already:
* For a kernel where SCSI low-level drivers are loaded as modules,
  you just need to keep the order constant
* For compiled in SCSI drivers, use scsihosts=
But actually, the patch is not meant to be the holy grail of persistent
device naming. But it enables userspace tools to collect information 
* reliably 
  (fails so far due to possible open() failures with unknown
   relation to the corresponding sg device (which could be opened))
* without too much trouble
Both things I consider important and useful.
The patch basically does provide two pieces of information:
* mapping between sg vs. other high level devices
* mapping CBTU to high-level devices
The latter one is enough for many setups, and the former can be used for
more elaborate solutions involving userspace tools more advanced than the
simple script I included in the patch.
If you want to go for the holy grail, you may either come up with a 
unique address at hardware level (which does currently not exist for all
types dealt with by the SCSI subsystem) and make it available to SCSI mid
level or use signatures that allows you to find devices back. LVM, e.g.
does the latter. 
But at this moment, I fear, neither of them are possible in all cases.
Regards,
