No no. Look at how this works:
 - only one dentry actually exists. It is marked "tentative", which means 
   that nobody will use it as-such without doing a lookup on it. It has 
   zero impact on aliases etc, because it's really just a place-holder: it
   doesn't point to any inodes at all, it only says "there may or may not
   be a file here"
   NOTE! This dentry is in no way case-insensitive. It happens to have 
   _exactly_ the contents (and hash) that the readdir entry had, but it
   has no meaning outside of that.
 - each caller of "__d_lookup()" will have to check if it's a tentative 
   dentry and basically ignore it if so.
   There aren't that many of them, and I think it all comes together in
   "do_lookup()", which may be the _only_ place that actually cares right
   now. Look at how that works right now:
		dentry = __d_lookup(..);
		if (!dentry)
			goto needs_lookup;	/* This case will allocate a whole 
					new dentry and use that for lookup */
		/* NEW CASE! */
		if (dentry->d_flags & D_TENTATIVE)
			goto needs_lookup_with_this_dentry;
	done:
		path->mnt = mnt;
		path->dentry = dentry;
		return 0;
	/*
	 * NEW CASE!!
	 *
	 * Unhash the tentative one, and look up a real one.
	 */
	needs_lookup_with_this_dentry:
		d_drop(dentry);
		dentry = NULL;
	/* OLD REGULAR CASE */
	needs_lookup:
		...
In other words, neither the low-level filesystem NOR anything else really 
ever sees the tentative dentry (the above is the really stupid approach: a 
slightly more clever one will avoid the "real_lookup()" alloc_dentry() 
thing and just use the tentative dentry after having unhashed it and 
verified that it's the only user).
See? Nobody actually ever sees the "raw dentry". They all go through 
__d_lookup(), and the rule would be:
 - if "d_lookup()" sees a tentative dentry, it will just unhash it and 
   drop it (it has the dcache lock, so it can do that)
 - all callers of "__d_lookup()" will have to check for D_TENTATIVE, and 
   decide what to do with it. I think there are exactly _three_ callers, 
   and one of them is d_lookup() itself.
See? Very very minimal impact that I can see (really, the biggest part
would be to do the dentry re-use in the better version of "do_lookup()" -
that would mean some re-organization, but maybe that optimization isn't
even worth it).
Or did I miss anything?
