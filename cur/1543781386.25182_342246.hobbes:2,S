There are two cases:
  1) Metadata.  If anybody is doing racy writes to metadata pages, it is
     your filesystem, and you have a bug.
  2) Data.  In Linux practice and Posix, racy writes to files have
     undefined semantics, including the possibility that data may end up
     interleaved on a disk block.
You seem to be trying to define (2) as "corruption" and setting out to prevent 
it.  But it is not the responsibility of a filesystem to prevent this, it is 
the responsibility of the application.
Could you please explain why it is not ok to end up with a half-written page 
in your cache, if the client was in fact halfway through writing it when it 
crashed?
Regards,
Daniel
