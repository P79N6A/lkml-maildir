i've uploaded the -P5 patch:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.8.1-P5
Changes since -P4:
 - increase PERCPU_ENOUGH_ROOM to avoid percpu overflow on SMP.
   (Mark H Johnson)
 - reduce ZAP_BLOCK_SIZE to 16 when vp != 0. This pushes the exit
   latency down to below 100 usecs on Lee Revell's box.
 - added a preempt_count field to /proc/latency_trace. This makes it
   easier to spot IRQ contexts and generally it gives a nice overview of
   how the preemption depth changes. It should also help us debug
   those 900usec weirdnesses related to cpu_idle. (if they still occur)
 - made the tcp packet-queue collapsing dependent on VOLUNTARY_PREEMPT.
 - fixed 10-20 msec latencies triggered by 'netstat', which occur when
   there are lots of sockets on a box.
 - rediffed against 2.6.8.1 for the patch to apply without fuzz
