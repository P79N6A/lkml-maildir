I do think we expect /proc/net when the netns support is disabled
to be as robust as it has been prior to 2.6.24, which is where we came
in.
The problem I tried to close one hole too many with my previous patch.
The simplest thing to do and that will make things work for everyone
in a tried and true fashion is not a complete revert but to simply
remove d_revalidate (which is causing all of the trouble).
We can figure out how to deal with the VFS mount handling not being
friendly to network filesystems  later.  The implementation details of
VFS mount handling do not lest us remove dcache entries for
directories (even when they have been removed from the backing store)
until we have removed all mounts from them and their children.  Since
I violated that rule. Kaboom!
