I suspect the right place to send this is:
netfilter-devel@vger.kernel.org
The subject line should indicate that you've contributed a patch
otherwise you may not get a quick response (I've modified it
accordingly).
For more on submitting patches you can read
Documentation/SubmittingPatches and Documentation/SubmitChecklist
