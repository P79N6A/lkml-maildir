Subject: [patch][3/4] ibmasm driver: redesign handling of remote control events

This patch rewrites the handling of remote control events.  Rather than
making them available from a special file in the ibmasmfs, now the
events from the RSA card get translated into kernel input events and
injected into the input subsystem.  The driver now will generate
two /dev/input/eventX nodes -- one for the keyboard and one for the
mouse.  The mouse node generates absolute events more like a touch pad
than a mouse.

My apologies for this being sent as an attachment, but 
I can't get my mailer to accept the one umlaut in the patch.
