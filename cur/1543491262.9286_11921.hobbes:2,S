On 29 Mar, brent verner spewed forth:

I'll try that and see what happens.
BTW, something else occurs to me.  What happens when the NT box is
rebooted (as they always are! :/)?  I get the same -3 error on the
samba_retry as if it timed out.  Any ideas on reconnection?  Ideally,
samba would keep retrying the connection with the UID/PWD of the user
who started smbmount, until either it reconnects, or is killed.
Is this what's supposed to happen?  If so, it doesn't seem to work so
well.
Also, on a kernel note ('bout time we mentioned it, since we're on a
kernel mailing list! ;) ), would it be a bad thing to undef the
SMB_PARANIOA flag? or maybe change it to the SMB_DEBUG.. flag?
