We're dealing with msec delays. Any frequency > 1000 will just cause
problems. There was a reason for using half that but it escapes me and
might be unneeded now. 500Hz/1000Hz is above the frequency the human eye
can see so is unlikely to present a problem.

This is the important bit. It should return an -EINVAL back to
userspace.

Duty cycles > 100 make no sense and would break the subsequent
calculation. Same problem/solution as above.
