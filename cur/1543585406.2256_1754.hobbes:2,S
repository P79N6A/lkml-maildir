I simply mirrored the check done in do_exit():
	if (tsk->pid == 1)
		panic("Attempted to kill init!");
Since PID_MAX is 32768 I do not believe pids can be negative.
I suppose one could make an argument for skipping "daemons", i.e.
pids below 300 (see the get_pid() function in kernel/fork.c), but
I think that is a larger issue.
