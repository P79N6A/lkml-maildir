Humm.  The kernel ppp module is not getting unloaded.  I am using both the
pppd 2.3.11 and pppd-mppe 2.3.10 versions (pppd-mppe has CHAP-80 and MPPE
patched into the code).  The user space module does load and unload a lot 
due to all the testing we are doing.  
I took the CWorthy ncurses interface I wrote for the NWFS tools, and am 
using it to write a pppconfig utility that handles modem setup, inittab, 
mgetty, options.ttyX, etc. so setting up a dial-in server will be as 
easy with IPX and IP as it is in NT.  
I have also noticed that pppd is not "kicking" modprobe -v the way it 
probably should, and the ppp kernel modules have to be loaded and 
configured manually.
