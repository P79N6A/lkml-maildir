It looks like sound drivers use PNP_DRIVER_RES_DISABLE to say "ignore
what PNP tells us about resource usage and we'll just use the compiled-
in or command-line-specified resources".
The main reason to do that would be to work around BIOS defects or
to work around deficiencies in the Linux PNP infrastructure (e.g.,
maybe we erroneously place another device on top of the sound card
or something).
I'm just suspicious because PNP_DRIVER_RES_DISABLE is only used in
sound drivers.  If it's to work around BIOS defects, why wouldn't
other PNP drivers need it sometimes, too?  And wouldn't it be better
to use PNP quirks for BIOS workarounds?

When resuming, wouldn't we *always* want to preserve the resource
allocation from the last suspend, regardless of whether
PNP_DRIVER_RES_DO_NOT_CHANGE is specified?
Linux PNP definitely has issues with suspend/resume, and I suspect
this is one of them.
