Umm.. can you?  That sounds suspiciously like "given an inode, how
do I find the pathname?".
How do you handle the case of a file that's hard-linked into 2 different
directories a "long way" apart in the heirarchy?  It's easy enough to
backtrack and find *A* path - the problem is if the watcher was on
some *other* directory:
mkdir -p /tmp/a/foo/bar/baz
mkdir -p /tmp/b/que/er/ty
touch /tmp/a/foo/bar/baz/flag
ln /tmp/a/foo/bar/baz/flag /tmp/b/qu/er/ty/flag
If you modify 'flag' again, how do you ensure that you find a watcher on
/tmp/a/foo or /tmp/b/qu, given that either or both might be there?
