Yes. OPEN should really be called NEW. Will try to fix that as it
seems to be causing confusion. I don't particularly like the naming
of RESOLVED or ACCEPTED either, but we'll have to see how hard it
is to change these things.
> Where does someone sign up for this new mailing list?
Email me. But I'm going to keep it to a small tight group for now,
will see how it works out from there. At the moment bugs that have
not real owner just go to me or Khoa, so this is a step up, even if
it's not perfect.
