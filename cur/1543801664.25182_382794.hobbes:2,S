Once you've narrowed down what two release kernels are "last one
working" & "first one broken" you can get even closer by doing a git
bisection search between those two to (hopefully) narrow it down to
the exact git commit that broke it.
It's a bit of work, but usually very useful to track down the exact
thing that broke it if nothing else finds the problem :)
