For both VGA and DVI I think the optimal answer is to build a small 
back-back breakout adapter.  The parts seem to be quite reasonably 
priced and reasonably available, eg from Farnell (www.farnell.co.uk):
VGA: Plug partcode 1071807 GBP 1.76   Socket partcode 1071811 GBP 2.10
DVI: Plug partcode 9965190 GBP 1.38   Socket partcode 1012227 GBP 2.01
If the original cabling looks like this:
   <Video card Socket>
     |
   <Original Cable Plug>
     |
     |
     |
   <Original Cable Plug>
     |
   <Monitor Socket>
then the breakout concept looks like this:
   <Video card Socket>
     |
   <Adapter Plug>
     |--------------------- I2C signal wires broken out
     |                      All wires passed to corresponding pins
   <Adapter Socket>
     |
   <Original Cable Plug>
     |
     |
     |
   <Original Cable Plug>
     |
   <Monitor Socket>

The adapter does give an opportunity to interrupt the connectivity of 
the I2C to the monitor if worst comes to worst, I guess no traffic is 
typically present after X init or Linux touching it.  Pretty ugly that 
things ignore b2-b0 of the I2C address.
A whole other way forward is to consider to replace the EEPROM from the 
original proposal (which does provide its own advantages such as 
simplicity, I accept) with something else that ends up on another PC. 
In this concept some logic presents a fake I2C peripheral to the DDC 
interface at an I2C address of our choosing.  This logic acts as a 
bidirectional "UART" type of thing, allowing transfer of data in both 
directions between the Linux box being debugged and another PC.
I designed something conceptually similar for the effort to hack the 
original Xbox, which was very effective (and is GPL'd):
http://warmcat.com/milksop/filtror.html
However this would be much simpler, not even needing RAM.  It can hook 
to the second PC by the same I2C method, parallel printer port, RS232 or 
USB depending on the level of complexity of the design.
I guess the link will feel quite like a 9600 or 19200 baud serial port 
in terms of throughput.

Maybe this effort is considered too esoteric, but it seems to me to be a 
reason to keep the DDC access drivers standalone, the hardware-specific 
framebuffer drivers can call through to them and we can use them in a 
clean way.  I realize this is a bit of a late objection and that there 
was not previously much point to keeping them as separate things in the 
world.

Address conflicts we can solve by widening the scope and powers of the 
interface into a generic communications link by adding a little 
hardware, removing the address clash.  If basically magic-ing a 
cheap-to-drive comms link out of nowhere, on most all PC-type hardware, 
has value then maybe it can sway people to keep the separated DDC drivers.
