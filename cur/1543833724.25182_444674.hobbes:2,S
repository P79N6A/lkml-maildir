That may be reasonable.  However please confirm that everything
that you have complaints from is using libpthreads.
As there is one use of libpthreads that is using sysctl
in a very non-serious way.
With libptrheads modified to use uname and not sysctl I am not seeing that
message.  I thought I had broken my test setup by forgetting to compile
glibc with --with-tls but I managed but I managed to get things working
again using LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.1
Still not the best data point but a very interesting one.
