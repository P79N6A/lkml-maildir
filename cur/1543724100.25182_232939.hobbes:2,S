      Hi All,
   I just joined the list. I have "played" with linux for about 3 years 
now. I am finally tired of windows to the point I have joined several 
Linux oriented Lists. I have to admit this list is one of the better 
lists I have joined. It is informative and active in a friendly and 
dynamic way. Thank you all for a great list!
