i really have no intention to allow multiple readers for rt-mutexes. We
got away with that so far, and i'd like to keep it so. Imagine 100
threads all blocked in the same critical section (holding the read-lock)
when a highprio writer thread comes around: instant 100x latency to let
all of them roll forward. The only sane solution is to not allow
excessive concurrency. (That limits SMP scalability, but there's no
other choice i can see.)
