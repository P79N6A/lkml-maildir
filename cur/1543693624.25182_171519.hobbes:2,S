Folks,
I am using 2.4.20 on a pentium with 256M ram. I am calling a 
function fxxx() in the user_mode, which results in an 
ioctl to a driver in kernel space. The function which handles
this function is k_fxx(), and this function calls some other
nested functions. IMHO somewhere in this call thread the stack
overflows and the process [which called fxxx] coredumps. How can 
I verify this hypothesis ? Is it possible to change the size of
the kernel for user process? can I set it per process ?
Please cc: Arun.Punj@marconi.com in your replies.
thanks
Arun
