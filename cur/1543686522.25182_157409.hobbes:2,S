Devil's advocate:
Then perhaps the (revision control) tool is getting in the way of doing 
the job and should be fixed?  :)
Perhaps being able to flag a changeset as a 'formatting change', and 
have the option to hide it or make it 'transparent' in some fashion? 
Hmm... "Annotate only the changes that relate to feature X."...
Oh, and a complete AI with that if you don't mind. ;)
But you've probably already thought about all this...
