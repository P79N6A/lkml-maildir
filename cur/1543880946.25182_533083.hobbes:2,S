Hi all...
After a big update in my systems, two of them just does not let me ssh into it.
It says that stdin is not a terminal. The same hapens if I try to open any
terminal emulator, like aterm.
It finally let me do somathing like ssh xxx@xxx /bin/bash -i, to get a terminal,
and I saw this:
nada:/etc/rc.d# ll /proc/self/fd/
total 0
lrwx------ 1 root root 64 2007.04.21 00:13 0 -> socket:[23705]
lrwx------ 1 root root 64 2007.04.21 00:13 1 -> socket:[23705]
lrwx------ 1 root root 64 2007.04.21 00:13 2 -> socket:[23707]
lr-x------ 1 root root 64 2007.04.21 00:13 3 -> /proc/6814/fd/
whats that ? udev really messed something ?
One other box is working just fine.
Any ideas ?
