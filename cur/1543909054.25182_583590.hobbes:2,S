Subject: [PATCH 0/23] make atomic_read() and atomic_set() behavior consistent across all architectures

By popular demand, I've redone the patchset to include volatile casts in 
atomic_set as well.  I've also converted the macros to inline functions, to help 
catch type mismatches at compile time.
This will do weird things on ia64 without Andreas Schwab's fix:

Notably absent is a patch for powerpc.  I expect Segher Boessenkool's assembly 
implementation should suffice there:

Thanks to all who commented on previous incarnations.
