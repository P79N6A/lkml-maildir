   I'm not sure why we haven't seen this before, but I started seeing a
stack trace on reboot on my rx2600 ia64 box running latest 2.6.  Here it
is:
 [<a0000001006ba020>] get_boot_pages+0x0/0x2c0
                                sp=e00000010267fc80 bsp=e000000102679130

 [<a0000001000b10a0>] sys_reboot+0x2e0/0x720
                                sp=e00000010267fd30 bsp=e000000102678f50
sba_alloc_coherent is simply calling __get_free_pages() to setup a DMA
mapping for the mpt driver to sync a disk.  However, we've already
cleared system_running in sys_reboot, so w/ CONFIG_NUMA, we blowup
trying to call get_boot_pages, which was already freed.  I'm not sure if
the proper fix is to make get_boot_pages not an __init function or if
the CONFIG_NUMA code really intends to be keying off something else. 
Thoughts on the right fix?  Thanks,
	Alex
