There is plenty of information on this:
- in the Documentation directory in the kernel source.
- in the mailing list FAQ, the address of which appended to every post
to this list.

The "kernel users" should follow the instructions above, search the
archives (address is in FAQ), if the problem has not been reported,
report it, if it has been reported (and they have no more information to
add) they should not post and can rest assured that at least the hackers
know about it... a fix may even be iminent.

A quick search for "kernel hacking" on google brings up
http://www.kernelhacking.org
which contains a kernelhacking-HOWTO (work in progress) in the docs
section.  It aims to make kernel hacking/programming/debugging
accessible to the average C programmer.
With a _little_ effort, you could have found all this information
yourself ;)

If the kernel doesn't currently do what _you_ want, _you_ should invest
_your_ time to learn how to make it do what you want, then contribute
your fix and what you learned in the process by helping others.  That is
what free software is all about.

happy hacking,
