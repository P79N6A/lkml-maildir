Yea, I haven't looked at the submitted implementation, but at CMU ACLs
were critical to be able to selectively share data between a very large
set of users w/o bugging an administrator. Given multiple classes per
semester which had multiple group projects, where you may have different
groups for each project, I have no clue how anyone would be able to
handle the (unix)group management required. ACLs let the users
themselves manage what people got what access to their data.
How else can I fix my partner's bugs (or vice-versa), give the clumsy TA
read only access, and let the cheat across the hall figure it out for
himself? (There may very well be a good solution to this w/o ACLs but
I've not seen it in use.)
So yea, I'd love to see a common ACLs API.
