Probably on the server's side it got an ICMP Host Unreachable or two as 
some router updated its tables, and decided to close the connection.  The 
FIN jumped the queue in one/several of the routers in the path, so it got 
reordered relative to the data.  This would imply that the router in 
question had its route to you back by the time the FIN got there.
Wierd, but far from impossible.

I think you provided enough info to tell what happened.

Doesn't look like a kernel problem.
Someone's got a dodgy link or a routing problem.
