i think whatever gcc does, we probably cannot get hurt more than we are 
hurting right now: everything is inlined, which bloats stuff to the 
maximum level. Stating that doesnt in any way excuse gcc 3.1's 
unilateral change of what 'inline' means, it doesnt reduce the distrust 
that might exist towards gcc, it's simply a statement of the situation 
we have right now. We can continue to distrust gcc (and probably 
rightfully so), but we probably cannot continue to hurt users as 
collateral damage of whatever tool-level fight. (and i'm not suggesting 
that this collateral damage is intentional in any way, it slowly evolved 
into the mess we have now.)
