OK, here's the patch to fix the boot problem, for reference (just the above
reversed).
http://mbligh.org/abat/no_hole
Now what's REALLY, REALLY wierd is that this fixes my hang problem
whilst trying to run kernbench:
http://mbligh.org/abat/no_hang
which is just reverting:
x86_64-use-a-common-function-to-find-code-segment-bases-fix.patch
But the patch is tiny, and it makes NO sense at all for this to fix
anything. All it does is:
diff -purN -X /home/mbligh/.diff.exclude 2.6.12-rc2-mm2/include/asm-x86_64/ptrace.h 2.6.12-rc2-mm2-no_hang/include/asm-x86_64/ptrace.h

How the hell can that possibly fix it? Boggle. But it does. I checked.
I ran a whole damned sequence of patches from your tree against the box,
then extracted the one where the failover started and retested it with
just that and the no_hole one. There's even a little green box to 
prove it about 4 down on the left here:
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/mbligh/abat/regression_matrix.html
My brain is now a small piece of silly-putty smushed against the far
wall of my study. Anything you can do to help me scrape up the remains
would be splendid. I can only speculate it's some wierd side-effect,
because I have no other explaination at all.
Humpf.
