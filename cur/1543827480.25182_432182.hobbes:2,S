	with the patch below i get the correct results.
the patch for testing and some changes for the block reads.
and the ACK seems working - i have some status bits
which get cleared on correct read (i.e. the ACK is sent) and i have them cleared.

	SMBus read it's fixed now on the board. As for the ACK problem i think it is ok.

	that works. there is a probe function if there is nothing dangerous 
known at this address why it can not be auto probed. any pointers where
to check how to autodetect it ?
