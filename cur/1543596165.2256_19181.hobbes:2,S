Here you have two options:
You are either under attack by someone who's trying to exploit your
LPRng (someone's trying to use LPR's logging function to get a shell).
This is the LPRng string format _syslog bug that theoretically could
allow root access. For more info check 
http://www.securityfocus.com/vdb/bottom.html?vid=1712
The other option is that you're under rpc.statd attack at the moment.
In either case, make sure you upgraded to the latest patch versions
and subscribe to BugTraq and the Security Focus Incidents mailinglist :)
regards,
Remco
