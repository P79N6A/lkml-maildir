I'm not sure what OS the T1 provider's box is running.  I experience the 
same problems trying to access kernel.org or one of my servers hosted at 
Verio in Sterling, VA.
Alan Cox says it's most likely a broken NAT box or firewall.  I'm not 
aware of any firewalls in between my office and my servers in Sterling 
other than the Cisco 1811 here in the office, and it is performing NAT 
and firewall services for our office.  I'm going to try a few cheapo 
home routers and see if the problem remains.  I would think the Cisco 
router would be better off than a home Linksys or Xincom one, but I 
figure it's at least worth a try.
Thanks for your help.
