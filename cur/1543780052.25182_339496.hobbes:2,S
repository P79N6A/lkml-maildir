Well, OK, it might be something to do with your drives trying to
negotiate IU and QAS.  Support for this was added to the sym2 driver but
never verified (because no-one seemed to have drives that could do it).
The attached should stop the driver from negotiating these two
parameters, if you could try it (it will produce complaints about static
functions defined but not used, but you can ignore them).
