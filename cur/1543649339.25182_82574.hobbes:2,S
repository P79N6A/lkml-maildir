It looks like the INQUIRY page code 0 is timing out and appears to have
hung the bus, as all other commands sent to the bus then timeout.
It's surprising that that would hang the bus.
That driver really needs at least some basic reset handling.
Try removing the scsi_load_identifier call in scsi_scan.c and
see if you can boot. And/or get sg_utils and on your 2.4 system
send a INQUIRY page 0 to the device, and see if that hangs or
not, like:
[patman@elm3a50 sg_utils]$ sudo ./sg_inq  -e -o=0 /dev/sg1
EVPD INQUIRY, page code=0x00:
 Only hex output supported
 00     00 00 00 0c 00 03 80 81  c0 c1 c2 c3 c7 c8 d1 d2    ................
