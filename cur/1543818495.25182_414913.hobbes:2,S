First of all sorry for the late answer.
My intention is to get the compile error fixed, and I don't care that 
much how it gets fixed.
OTOH, there's the question whether it matters at all - is the 
intersection of the people who are in such space-limited environments 
that they are setting CONFIG_EMBEDDED=y and then CONFIG_SYSFS=n and
the people using OCFS2 actually non-empty?
