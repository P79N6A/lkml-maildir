Keep in mind that just about any virtualized environment might benefit from 
being able to tell the parent system "we're not using this ram".  I mentioned 
UML, and I can also imagine a Linux driver that signals qemu (or even vmware) 
to say "this chunk of physical memory isn't currently in use", and even if 
they don't actually _free_ it they can call madvise() on it.
Heck, if we have prezeroing of large blocks, telling your emulator to 
madvise(ADV_DONTNEED) the pages for you should just plug right in to that 
infrastructure...
