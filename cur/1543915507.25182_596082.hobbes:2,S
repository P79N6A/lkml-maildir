Hm, does that mean you can reproduce this when you modprobe/rmmod
either of them on a fresh boot? (There could be follow-on errors...)
Could you try with DEBUG_KOBJECT set?

Is this the first error message you see? This looks like the embedded
kset had its refcount decreased too much. (Or was the sdio bus never
registered? Don't see how this could happen if mmc_init was successful,
though.)
(The next errors seem to have the same cause.)

Strange. Can't see how this can happen except as a follow-on error.
(Next ones are follow-on errors from this one.)

(Following errors don't look like they could have anything to do with
the driver core.)
