Yes, I thought that just returning "0" from these function would
successfully disable checksumming, but now the situation is as such;
- TCP still does the checksum and seems as if no patch is applied at all
- UDP now does not do checksum if it should return a destination unreachable
error. (that means, when I inject a packet to a closed socket, regardless of
the checksum in the packet, the system now sends a destination unreachable
error). However this is the only change, still the application do not
receive UDP packets with wrong checksum. (Such as netcat or snmpget etc.)
Perhaps this is not the way?

OK, try this, not tested:
replace the return statements with "return 0;" in:
net/ipv4/udp.c, function __udp_checksum_complete, about line 759
net/ipv4/icp_input.c, function __tcp_checksum_complete_user, about line 4070
* line numbers above are for linux-2.6.7
