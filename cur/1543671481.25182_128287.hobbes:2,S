Heh. I just happen to have written a multi-threaded webserver (called
Seminole), but it does CGI "in process." Actually, it runs on VxWorks too
where there is no concept of a process. :-)
But you're right. This could be a boon for any non-in-process (non
mod_perl or PHP) webservers.
The idea would be that the file mapping array would be easier to scan
(kind of like how poll() is a lot easier than select()).

Yup. I suppose for Apache this could be an alternate interface of the APR
spawn process function.
