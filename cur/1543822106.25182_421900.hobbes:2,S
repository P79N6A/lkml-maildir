Looks like both count it, or something stranger is going on.
2.6.16:
static unsigned long count_active_tasks(void)
{
         return (nr_running() + nr_uninterruptible()) * FIXED_1;
}
2.4.0:
static unsigned long count_active_tasks(void)
{
         struct task_struct *p;
         unsigned long nr = 0;
         read_lock(&tasklist_lock);
         for_each_task(p) {
                 if ((p->state == TASK_RUNNING ||
                      (p->state & TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE)))
                         nr += FIXED_1;
         }
         read_unlock(&tasklist_lock);
         return nr;
}
