I tried my card on the windows PC, but we wasn't able to install the 
original driver, as it is outdated and didn't install on Windows XP. So 
we used:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/btwincap
Using this driver, I had exactly the same problem, I also have on Linux. 
I was able to get a second card, which is the same model, I have. I 
tried the second one, too and also have the missing lines with the 
second card.
Now I don't know, if this is a driver problem, or if this model of bt878 
card is just cheap shit.
