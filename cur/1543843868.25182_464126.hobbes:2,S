On similar lines, some time back, i read that, to accomodate large
physical memory ,
the 3G/1G layout is modified to have 4G/4G partition. But if somebody
can focus the light on following things, it will be helpful.
1) what was the requirement of 4G/4G layout ?
2) how it is managed ?
3) how HIGH_MEMORY concept is related here.
Thanks in advance,
Yogeshwar
