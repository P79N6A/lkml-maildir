Yeah, this does suck.  That ioctl hack isn't pretty.

You just lose some of the fault tolerance, until you rerun a partition
tool (or even boot a kernel) that re-does the end of it, adjusting
for the new disk size.
The whole point of having an extra copy of the table is to be fault
tolerant, not to introduce another point of failure!
