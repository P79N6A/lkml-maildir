Yes- if that makes sense. For a lot of data it does. But for a lot of
transactions and systems, it's a little less clear. I sort of liked the
speculative I/O execution thread paper of Fay Chang's which might do what
this mini-paper is talking about, but at runtime. That is, dynamically
generate a hint-list. That's really good for reads, and logging
filesystems with offpeak garbage collection may solve a lot of the write
problems?
