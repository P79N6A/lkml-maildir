The problem is that kthread_stop used to send a signal to the kthread,
which meant we didn't have to beware of races (since it would never
sleep any more): kthread_should_stop() was called signal_pending 8)
Andrew hated the signal mechanism, so I abandoned it, but didn't go back
and fix all the users.  It's tempting to send a signal anyway to make
life simpler, though, although that might set a bad example for others.
