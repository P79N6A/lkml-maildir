major/minor numbers are still required to (a) uniquely identify a device
(e.g. "is this file on the same filesystem as this other one?"), (b)
identify when block devices are on the same physical device
(e.g. "should I run these fscks in parallel or not?").
They're also recognised by applications: Glibc (see ptsname) and
anything statically linked with it knows about pty device numbers.
Aside from that they can go :-)
