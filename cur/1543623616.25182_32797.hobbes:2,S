Yep, but microkernel => userland filesystems ;-). Anyway, they *can*
do things linux can't do (or linux has hard time with), like
partitioning physical machine into few logical ones, filesystems in
userland, ability to debug drivers on production machines, etc.
I like those features, but I'm not sure if costs introduced by
u-kernels are worth it.
