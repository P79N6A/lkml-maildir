Looks like you think differently :)

I guess you mean that check_start_me_again() can miss start_me_again != 0 ?
Yes, of course, it should check the condition from time to time. We can even
do
	start_me_again = 1;
	wake_up(&start_me_again_wq);
, this is still unsafe.

Yes. But RCU core doesn't write to rcu_head (except call_rcu). Callback _owns_
rcu_head, it should be ok to use it in any way without fear to break RCU.
Of course, callback should take care of its own locking/ordering.

So. Do you claim that rcu_func() above is buggy?

Agreed.
