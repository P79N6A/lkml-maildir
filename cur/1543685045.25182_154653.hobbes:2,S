Actually, it does:
./arch/arm/kernel/Makefile:obj-$(CONFIG_PM)             += pm.o
./arch/arm/mach-pxa/Makefile:obj-$(CONFIG_PM) += pm.o sleep.o
./arch/arm/mach-sa1100/Makefile:obj-$(CONFIG_PM)                        += pm.o sleep.o
./arch/i386/kernel/Makefile:obj-$(CONFIG_PM)            += suspend.o
./drivers/pci/Makefile:obj-$(CONFIG_PM)  += power.o
./kernel/Makefile:obj-$(CONFIG_PM) += pm.o power/
But, I agree with your change anyway.
