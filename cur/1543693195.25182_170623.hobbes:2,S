Subject: How come the assembler can't count? (probably insignificant, but 0x37ffffff truncated to 0x37ffffff seems strange)

This is probably completely insignificant, but I'm wondering why I get
warnings like the following when compiling 2.6.0-test* kernels :
tmp/cc211T0f.s: Assembler messages:
/tmp/cc211T0f.s:860: Warning: value 0x37ffffff truncated to 0x37ffffff
It seems like the assembler can't count since it seems to believe that
truncating a value to the same exact value would make a difference...
I've been trying to find the reason for this message, but so far I've not
been able to locate it. Does someone have an explanation for this
seemingly bogus warning?
