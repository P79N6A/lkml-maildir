First of all, #ifdef... is bogus - check kmod.h and you'll see what
happens if CONFIG_KMOD is undefined. So removing it is OK right now.
Another thing being that yes, it would be nice to have printf-like _real_
request_module(). The only thing to watch for is literal module name
passing - if you know that name will never contain % you are fine,
otherwise you'll need to go for "%s",name.

See above. Don't bother with always making it a function - just keep
kmod.h as-is and it will take care of the thing.
