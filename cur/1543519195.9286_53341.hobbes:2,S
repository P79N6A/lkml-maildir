Hi,
we (try to) run a dual p-III 500 machine with 1Gb RAM and 2.2.13.
In the kernel config the option CONFIG_2GB is set to use all the RAM instead
of about 960Mb. Unfortunately the machine crashes a lot. Oops reports are only
on console and not in the logs, so i can't actually supply one here.
Yesterday i run several memtest's (from freshmeat) with interesting results:
To overcome the PHYSPAGES/2 limit in mlock i did run 2 memtest in parallel,
each about 500 Mb big.
Sometimes i got:
 zap_pte_range: bad pmd ... messages
and one time a 
 panic: free list corrupted 
just before the crash. 
At the moment the machine is running 2.3.31 with no errors encountered so far.
My question: Is this a known issue with 2.2.13 ? 
Should i try CONFIG_1GB instead of CONFIG_2GB ?
I noticed that the kernel is "mapped" to 0xC000000 using CONFIG_1GB and
in 2.3.31 using that 4GB config option. But if i use 2.2.13 and CONFIG_2GB
it is "mapped" to 0x8000000. 
Any clues on that ?
-Michael
