one of the virtual metatags should be something about the method to 
serialize the data
if you are viewing a tarfile as a directory the VFS/Filesystem shoud know 
that the link between the whole thing and the contents is tar, and it 
should be possible for userspace programs to find this out by reading teh 
appropriate thing inside the virtual directory (and eventually change it 
as well, which would trigger regeneration of the base object, or at least 
noting that the current version is wrong and needs to be regenerated)
