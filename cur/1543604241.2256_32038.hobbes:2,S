Now, before people get all excited, what is this particular code
actually _good_ for?
Creating a lock-free list that allows insertion concurrently with lookup
is _easy_.
But what's the point? If you insert stuff, you eventually have to remove
it. What goes up must come down. Insert-inane-quote-here.
And THAT is the hard part. Doing lookup without locks ends up being
pretty much worthless, because you need the locks for the removal
anyway, at which point the whole thing looks pretty moot.
Did I miss something?
