Hi,
after doing some code review it seems like I found 2 bugs.
a.) deadlock within the pccard/pcmcia framework
b.) slab corruption when unloading the driver
a.) it's easy to reproduce a, just run
$ while :; do pccardctl eject; pccardctl insert; done
concurrently on 2 shells.
another way to reproduce it is:
$ while :; do insmod oz...ko; pccardctl insert; pccardctl eject; rmmod
oz...ko; done
(it's sufficient to run that on one shell)
The bug is sysfs related, there are 2 locks one to protect critical
parts of the pccard/pcmcia framework, the other one to lock the sysfs
inode. I'll try to commit a patch for this during the next few days I
was able to solve one problem there already.
b.) slab corruption; it's a bit difficult to reproduce since a. might
lock up the device before anything shows up. So I haven't done much
here yet.
