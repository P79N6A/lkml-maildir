Okay, after Ralf's message I found this newsgroup post:

I got a new firmware from Maxtor today. My disks now have firmware
VA111900, before that I had VA111630. Let's see what happens...
PS: Maxtor's hotline guy had no record about firmware related
problems. I'd like to report those (with the two additional
references), but now the hotline has technical difficulties...
Bye,
