How about just adding an early test:
	if (!chip->midi_out)
		goto out;
and adding a label for out before the chip->lock unlock?  We still need to 
clear chip->midi_full so we still require the spinlock, but there's no 
reason we should be testing chip->midi_out multiple times since the 
remaining code path in its entirety depends on it.
