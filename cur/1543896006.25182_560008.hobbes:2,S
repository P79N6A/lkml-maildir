The freedom to "run the program, for any purpose" is just as much violated
by Microsoft when they make the Xbox. You can't run the Linux kernel on that
either, for the exact same reasons you can't run a modified Linux kernel on
the Tivo. It is manifestly obvious that the "freedom to run the program for
any purpose" must be limited to those pieces of hardware where you are the
one who decides what hardware runs on that software. (And GPL rights were
always applicable equally to all hardware in the universe, not specially to
some hardware and not others.)
