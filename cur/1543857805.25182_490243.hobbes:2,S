IOW, you're suggesting I walk the process list from userspace to find a
process for which a) it claims it's running for a given nbd device, and
b) I can verify that it actually has the permissions to do so. That's a
whole lot of code in comparison to
f=open("/sys/block/nbd2/pid", O_RDONLY);
read(f,buf,len);
I think I very much prefer the above two lines, not only for simplicity.
Also, your suggestion relies on users /only/ using the official
nbd-client, and is fragile in cases where that assumption is false
(i.e., it's susceptible to false negatives). The suggested patch does
not have that problem.
