Perhaps it is huge, but it is a small fraction of the GPFS kernel
implementation.

The sys_call_table stuff was under #ifdef, and was intended for
use by a research project that was later put out of its misery.
This stuff has since been removed from the source tree.
As to the evilish tricks with lowlevel MM code, the whole point
of the mmap_invalidate_range() patch is to be able to rid GPFS
of exactly these evilish tricks.

Again, the point of the mmap_invalidate_range() patch is to be able
to do precisely this.
						Thanx, Paul
