I tried manually removing -fomit-frame-pointer from Makefile and adding 
-fno-omit-frame-pointer but with same results - junk return addresses. 
Probably a X86_64 issue.

I looked at ndiswrapper mailing lists and found this explanation for the same 
issue of growing size-64 with ndiswrapper  -
----------------------------------
"It looks like the problem is kernel-version related, not ndiswrapper. 
 ndiswrapper just uses some API that starts the memory leak but the 
 problem is indeed in the kernel itself. versions from 2.6.10 up to 
 .11-rc3 have this problem afaik. haven"t tested rc4 but maybe this one 
 doesn"t have the problem anymore, we will see"
----------------------------------
I tested -rc4 and it has the problem too.  More over, with plain old 8139too 
driver, the slab still continues to grow albeit slowly. So there is a reason 
to suspect kernel leak as well. I will try binary searching...
