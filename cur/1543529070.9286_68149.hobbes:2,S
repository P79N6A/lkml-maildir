Sure, the process was swapping out from fast memory to a slow disk...
as far as it being unusable, the kernel was probably busy juggling
interrupts.  This is probably a question for an x86 person who is
familiar with the new generation of eide disks; all of my boxes are
axp with scsi.

Possibly.  I've used Linux for 7 years, dropped code into the 
main kernel and am actively working on a distribution, but went with 
FreeBSD on the desktop at work.  Tried an equally-configured Linux box, 
but it would repeatedly choke and panic when loading large (.5-2G) 
tcpdump captures.  Best thing you can do in this situation is 
back off your data, stick BSD on the hardware, and compare results. 
In the 'real world' (whatever that is), application performance usually
determines platform choice. 
That said, a personal Linux dev box (500Mhz EV56 w/768M ram, 
 UW-SCSI disk array) chews up said large captures for breakfast 
without flinching or crashing.

Shell ulimits (bash(1)) are the current way of handling this.  
It would be nice to get a set of userland tools for setting 
processor affinity, per-pid/uid resource tweaking, etc.
