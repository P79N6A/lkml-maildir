I agree that since couple of people are voicing disagreement the definitely it means something and
probably it means that you are right.
Let's try to apply the same logic to my explanation:
KFREE() macro has __actually__ been used at atleast 1000 places in the kernel by atleast 50
different people. Doesn't that lend enough credibility to what I am saying.
People did something like this 1000 times: kfree(x), x = NULL. I simply proposed the KFREE() macro
that does the same thing. Resistance to something that is already being done in the kernel. I
really do not care whether it goes in the kernel or not. There are lots of other places where I
can contribute. But I do not understand the resistance.
It is already being done in the kernel.
