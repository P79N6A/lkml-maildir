No, it really is as confusing as it sounds!
The drive is SATA, but the transfer speed gunk only
applies to the internal "PATA" portion of the drive,
which communicates to the built-in SATA bridge chip
of the same drive, which in turn presents a pure SATA
interface to the host computer.

Same as always:  hdparm -I /dev/sd?
(requires the libata-dev "passthru" patch
recently reposted here by Jeff Garzik).
