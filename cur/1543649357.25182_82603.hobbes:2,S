	Actually, I'm not 100% happy with the IrDA situation. I would
not mind someone exporting more events to RtNetlink, very similar to
the functionality/events I already provide in the IrNET control
channel (discovery/expiry/link blocked/...).
	Note that if you are only interested in IrNET, then the IrNET
control channel gives you everything you need, and you don't really
need to use RtNetlink. Personally, I think the future of IrDA is
IrNET, so that's why I don't bother with the rest.
	In any case, send me a link to you applet, I'll add that on my
web page.

	Check this thread :
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=1165868&forum_id=1881
	Basically, you need to check the code in hcid.c (in utils) to
know how to collect this events. I've coded this and it works
perfect. Yeah, it's another socket to manage.
