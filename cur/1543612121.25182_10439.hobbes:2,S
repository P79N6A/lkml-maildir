Subject: APIC Error when doing apic_pm_suspend

I get an APIC error 0x40 when resuming from an apm -s. If i'm correct
that would be an illegal register access wouldn't it? I tried putting
enter/exit printks in the apic_pm_resume/suspend functions and it showed
that both returned before the APIC error printk. Is there anyway of finding out
which register access it was? I "thought" it would be one of the
apic_writes in the pm functions but looks like i might be wrong.
The kernel is compiled with local APIC and gets detected and enabled on
boot (UP machine).
Thanks,
