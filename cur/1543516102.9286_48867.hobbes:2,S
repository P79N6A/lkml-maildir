	linux-2.3.28/fs/ext2 does not link as a module if module
versions are enable.  This is because a number of files in the ext2
module unnecessarily include <linux/module.h>, resulting in
conflicting declarations of the .modinfo stuff.  This patch simply
deletes those unncessary #include statements.  I have a machine running
this code now.  It works.
