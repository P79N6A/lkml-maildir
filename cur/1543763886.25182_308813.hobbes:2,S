Sam,
Here are a few more suggestions for you to consider.
- in Networking support, move Network testing and Netpoll
support to the end of the menu (basically put the devel.
tools toward the bottom of the menu)
- I would rather not "hide" Amateur Radio, IrDA, and
Bluetooth in the Networking protocols area, but have them
near 802.1x and ATM in the top-level Networking support
menu.  How does that sound to you?
Thanks.
