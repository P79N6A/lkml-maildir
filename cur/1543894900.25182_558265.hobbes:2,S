The problem is not the bug tracking system, be it manual tracking in a 
text file or a Wiki or be it in Bugzilla or any other bug tracking 
system.
One problem is the lack of experienced developers willing to debug bug 
reports.
But what really annoyed me was the missing integration of regression 
tracking into the release process, IOW how _you_ handled the regression 
lists.
If we want to offer something less of a disaster than 2.6.21, and if we 
want to encourage people to start and continue testing -rc kernels, we 
must try to fix as many reported regressions as reasonably possible.
This means going through every single point in the regression list 
asking "Have we tried everything possible to solve this regression?". 
There are very mysterious regressions and there are regressions that 
might simply be reported too late. But if at the time of the final 
release 3 week old regressions hadn't been debugged at all there's 
definitely room for improvement. And mere mortals like me reminding 
people is often not enough, sometimes an email by Linus Torvalds himself 
asking a patch author or maintainer to look after a regression might be 
required.
And a low hanging fruit to improve the release would be if you could 
release one last -rc, wait for 48 hours, and then release either this 
-rc unchanged as -final or another -rc (and wait another 48 hours).
There were at least two different regressions people ran into in 2.6.21 
who successfully tested -rc7.
