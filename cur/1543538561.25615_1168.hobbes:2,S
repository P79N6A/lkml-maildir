I think there was a small thread recently about this here on
linux-kernel, and somebody mentioned it has been already fixed. Please
look in the archives or try a pre17 kernel.

These are not error messages, but just debug messages (I get them,
too, with 2.2.14). I think there was also a patch posted recently
which removed them, IIRC.
