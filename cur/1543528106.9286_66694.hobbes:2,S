Subject: [uPATCH - 2.3.49-2] parport moved under main menu

part of 2.3.49-pre2 moved the "source drivers/parport/Config.in" call
such that parallel port support went under the main menu in menuconfig
instead of in general setup... if this was intentional (I can't see why,
though) and I missed the discussion, my apologies.
