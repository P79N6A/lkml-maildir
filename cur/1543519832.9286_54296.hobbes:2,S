The rest of the kernel already uses a 32-bit type for pid_t, but prevents
pids from exceeding 32767.

Only poorly written ones, I hope. Anyway, most of the programs that really
need to use UIDs/GIDs are run as root, and compiled from source, which
makes converting to 32-bit UIDs fairly painless.
The problem with a 32-bit pid_t is that an old libc5 program that fork()s
and has a child with pid >32767 is going to break when it tries to send a
signal to the child. There is no nice way to fix this; the only workaround
I can think of is hacking the old libc to remap pid numbers in user space.
Ick.
