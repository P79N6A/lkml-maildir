Time has passed without further mention of this problem. Today I took
some time to discover exactly where the boot process was hanging. I
found the place. 
In drivers/usb/host/pci-quirks.c, in function quirk_usb_disable_ehci
(should start around line 211) there is a stanza that reads:
			/* always say Linux will own the hardware
			 * by setting EHCI_USBLEGSUP_OS.
			 */
			pci_write_config_byte(pdev, offset + 3, 1);
On my sapphire athlon64 motherboard (see the thread for more details),
this call never returns (without generating any output). I commented
it out, and now the EHCI subsystem works OK (currently running
2.6.16rc2).
I do not know what the right patch should be.
