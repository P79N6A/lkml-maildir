Page clustering wants something similar but slightly different. The
unit it wants as its stride (MMUPAGE_SIZE) isn't present so this doesn't
really help or hurt it. I believe I actually dodged this bullet by
ensuring (or incorrectly assuming) the callers used sizes <= MMUPAGE_SIZE
and left it either unaltered and suboptimal or (worst-case) buggy.
I'm just going down the list of FIXME's in the VM I turned up by grepping.
Should we do the following instead?
