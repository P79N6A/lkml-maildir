Yes, true.

I hope nobody will buy Microsoft products from now on, now that they are
not only filled with internal bugs but also with external ones introduced
by the guys from Leningrad... :)
But it is probably Microsoft's own original way of "releasing source under
GPL". Maybe they don't have the guts to admit that the proprietary
software model (in OS market, where Linux dominateth!) is a failure so
they make it look like some script-kiddie posted their source listings on
the Usenet (or wherever he is going to post them?) and so they "have no
choice but to release windoz under GPL" :)

PS. Leningrad is the old historical name of the modern St. Petersberg but
we "old-timers" do still call it Leningrad, it seems more appropriate than
all those "modern" name-changes... ;)
