I can implement differently what I want, though it will be somewhat 
kludgy and kernel depenedent (depends on a version and distribution). I 
wanted to avoid that. Since what I write is really an application and 
not interface, it was very "native" to use application syscall approach.
My real problem is not how to implement it. I want to understand this 
specific x86_64 problem.
