Thanks, Jeff!

With passthru, it would really be much better to just leave it enabled
without any option.  It's NOT on any main code path, and users/distros
have to intentionally run "smartctl -d ata" or "hdparm /dev/sd*" to
trigger any of it.
So it is already "off", unless somebody wants to use it.
This is different from the ATAPI code.
But good to have it finally going upstream where it will get used.
Cheers!
