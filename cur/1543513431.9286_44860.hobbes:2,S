Hi,
I'm running Red Hat 6.1 (i386) and my dmesg seems to have filled
with "VFS: Disk change detected on device sr(11,0)".
I'm running autofs and have noticed that this happens only when
my cdrom is scsi and not ide.
Anyone know what is going on or how to stop this
aside from not running autofs?
Thanks,
Tuan
