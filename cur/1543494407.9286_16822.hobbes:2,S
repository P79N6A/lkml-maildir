Well If you want to do benchmarks I suggest you to do that over the things
you do with your machines. I tend to optimize the kernel for the software
I use here ;).
So if in your normal usage you do some intensive VM work you can simply
write a script that simulate your normal load, and then issue
`/usr/bin/time ./script` and compare a clean 2.2.7 with one of my patches 
(I suggest the latest that [usually] is also the greatest ;).
