Good news, WPA association is back to work for me using
 wireless_tools.29.pre10 and wpa_supplicant-0.4.9 with
 2.6.18-git11 vanilla
 2.6.18-git11 with reverted wireless fixes
 2.6.18-git13
 which appears to mean that backward compatibility of the
 new tools with older kernel features has also been tested :)
Dave, do you want me to file a request for updated FC5 RPMs
 for wireless-tools and wpa_supplicant in bugzilla or is it
  - already happening
  - never going to happen
 ?
Thanks, ciao,
