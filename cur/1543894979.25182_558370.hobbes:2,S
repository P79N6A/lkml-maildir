  Sujet : airo suspend problem
      À : linux-pm@lists.osdl.org
Hi,
the airo driver (drivers/net/wireless/airo.c) does in its suspend routine [1].
But not all the pci cards support power management and cause
pci_enable_wake/pci_set_power_state to return errors.
On pci card that don't support PM, what should be done ?
Don't call pci_enable_wake/pci_set_power_state ?
Thanks
Matthieu
PS : after the failed suspend to ram due to airo driver, I tried to unload airo
driver and it hanged. After a reset, I got my ext3 root fs corrupted :(
[1]
pci_enable_wake(pdev, pci_choose_state(pdev, state), 1);
pci_save_state(pdev);
return pci_set_power_state(pdev, pci_choose_state(pdev, state));
