<DIV><FONT size=2>Excuse my ignorance, but would someone explain to me why Linux 
and other Unices are vulnerable to buffer overflow exploits? I suspect it's 
because the code, data and stack for a given process is kept in a single memory 
segment, but I'm not at all sure about that. If however, I'm right, would Linux 
Alpha, running on a Harvard architecture 21164, be immune from this 
weakness?</FONT></DIV>
