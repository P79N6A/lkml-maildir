Surely the estimate of 100 forks/sec is low.  I get 83 forks/sec on
a 486-75 and a Python program, just as an estimate.  Besides,
vulnerabilities due to PID wrap should just plain get fixed, if only
because ports to a "lesser" unix might be made.
31- or 32-bit PIDs might be a convenience, but they don't furnish security
against wraparound attacks, they just make them take a little longer to
exploit.
