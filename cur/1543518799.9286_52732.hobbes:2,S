Yes, but almost always when you perform "optimise for xxx but maintain
compability", you slow down (and/or increase memory comsumption) for all
the other alternatives that you don't compile for.
Tests performed by someone on the debian-devel list recently showed that
programs optimised for pentiums, were slower on _all_ other
processor-models (486/PPro/AMD etc.) than 386-code.
And the cache-aligning used in the kernel right now is at least too big
for both 386's and 486's.
It's not that I oppose optimisations, it's just that I want there to be
an 386-optimized version too; there is none now, only a "works for 386,
but probably butt-slow" option.
