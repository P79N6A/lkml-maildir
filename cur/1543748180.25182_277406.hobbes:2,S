I think it is actually pretty good at general purpose stuff. For
example, the old writes starve reads thing. It is especially bad
when doing small dependent reads like `find | xargs grep`. (Although
CFQ is probably better at this than deadline too).
It also tends to degrade more gracefully under memory load because
it doesn't require much readahead.

That is synch write bandwidth. Yes that seems to be a problem.
