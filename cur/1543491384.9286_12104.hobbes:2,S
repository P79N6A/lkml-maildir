	I'm having problems (segmentation faults) when using some
apps under 2.2.3 an later kernels (have not tested it under previous kernels
yet) with some "out of memory" errors under some apps, for example
under kreversi or x11amp, after stracing this programs I've found that
the problem is related to a failed mmap (although I have 512Mb of RAM :-).
	I'm using GNU Libc-2.1 and egcs, but everything was right with
the same configuration under 2.2.1 (I've not tested it on 2.2.2), is it
a new feature which requires some changes in the code or is it a bug in
those programs?
	Thanks
