I have anMy system has an AMD K6-2 and is running kernel 2.2.9 with our without
the latest mtrr patch.
There is an mtrr entry in /proc and the mtrr flag in /proc/cpuinfo is set:
processor       : 0
vendor_id       : AuthenticAMD
cpu family      : 5
model           : 8
model name      : AMD-K6(tm) 3D processor
stepping        : 12
cpu MHz         : 350.810582
fdiv_bug        : no
hlt_bug         : no
sep_bug         : no
f00f_bug        : no
coma_bug        : no
fpu             : yes
fpu_exception   : yes
cpuid level     : 1
wp              : yes
flags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr mce cx8 sep mtrr pge mmx 3dnow
bogomips        : 699.60
However, the command 'cat /proc/mtrr' produces no output. Also the command
'echo "base=0xf8000000 size=0x400000 type=write-combining" >! /proc/mtrr'
has no effect.
I have read 'Documentation/mtrr.txt' and tried to get a hint from
'arch/i386/kernel/mtrr.c'. Unfortunately this was without success.
So, it would be very kind if someone could point out  other sources of
information or - even better - just tell me what I'm doing wrong :-)
Thanks a lot for your time and best regards
        Andree
