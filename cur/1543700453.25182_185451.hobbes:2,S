But we want to get rid of lock_kernel(), not create new code that depends 
on it.
And _especially_ if fasync_helper() is rarely used, that means that 
changing the callers to have a nicer calling convention would not be 
painful.

Note that my personal preference would be to kill off "kill_fasync()" 
entirely.
We actually have almost all the infrastructure in place already: it's 
called a "wait queue". In 2.5.x it took a callback function, and the only 
thing missing is really the "band" information at wakeup time.
So if we instead made the whole fasync infrastructure use the existing 
wait-queues, and made wakeup() say what kind of wakeup it is, we could 
probably get rid of the specific fasync datastructures entirely. And we'd 
only take locks that we take _anyway_.
I dunno. But to me that at least sounds like a real cleanup.

And two functions that statically do something different is actually 
_better_ than one function that does two different things dynamically.
And if the two cases have different locking, then they should remain as 
two separate cases.
