it's not that easy. Simply put: the gcc people release an update every 6
months; distros "jump ahead" the bugfixes on that usually. (think of it
like -stable, where distros would ship patches accepted for -stable but
before -stable got released). Taking an older compiler from gcc.gnu.org
doesn't mean it's bug free. It just means you're not getting bugfixes.
