OK, so lets get down to brass tacks and look at the API characteristics.
Some of the issues are:
     1. Should kmap() actually flush all the user spaces? 
     2. Do we need additional hints in to kmap/kunmap?
My initial thought on 1. is no, since by and large we use kmap on pages
that have come to use via an I/O path, so usually they've already had
the user caches made coherent, unless you want do do this via a hint.
For 2. like I said, I coded this on parisc without hints (using the page
table information instead to deduce what type of access the page had
taken) but we could equally well have used hints.
