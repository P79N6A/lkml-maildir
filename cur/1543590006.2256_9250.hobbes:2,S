This might be grasping at straws I remember VIA problem in the "good old
days" of Socket 7 with CPU/PCI Prefetches and especially Read-around-Write
settings that would cause issues like we're seeing with the Athlon
pre-fetches. This could be (total conjecture) related somehow to the
corruption bugs they are admitting to in the 686B although they are blaming
the SB Live now.
