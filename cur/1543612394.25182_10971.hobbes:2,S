And it is absolutely amazing what you *can* do, if you have the soure,  
what you never expected to be able to do, but because you *do* have the  
source, you just *have* to look at the problem area ... and poof! there's  
something that certainly doesn't look right, maybe if you just try to  
change this little bit ...
And thus you learn something new which you wouldn't even have tried with  
closed source.
It's not only this. I remember when I first tried to get PPP to work - no,  
wait, back then it was SLIP. (Slightly before Linux 1.0, I think.) It just  
wouldn't work, and I had no idea why. Obviously I was doing something  
wrong, but what?
So I looked at the relevant kernel part. Still rather unclear, but the  
data has to go through *here* ... now suppose I insert a printk there, and  
one there, and then reboot and retry and watch syslog ... aha! (Well,  
actually, it took me several passes, and I don't remember what the problem  
turned out to be except it wasn't a kernel bug.)
