Hello,
       I have some questions...
1)When data is copied to ICMP/UDP packets? 
when i trace kernel code in 2.4.26 kernel version is
that in case of ICMP and UDP packets the packet gets
its space allocated in ip_build_xmit function and then
ip header is built.
2) What getfrag does? Does it copies actual data in
packet?
3)Also can anybody explain me function 
int ip_build_xmit(struct sock *sk,int getfrag (const
void *,char *,unsigned int, unsigned int),const void
*frag,
		  unsigned length,
		  struct ipcm_cookie *ipc,
		  struct rtable *rt,
		  int flags)
and its parameter usage???
regards,
linux_lover
