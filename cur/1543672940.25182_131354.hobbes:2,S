So I'm not the only one having this problem... I think I first saw this
with 2.5.68 but I'm not sure.
My boot partition is a small ext3 partition on a lvm2 volume accessed
over device-mapper (I've written a lilo patch for that, but the patch is
working and) but I don't think that has something to do with the
problem.
When syncing, unmounting and waiting some time after running lilo, the
changes sometimes seem correctly written to disk, I don't know when
exactly.
Could it be that the location of /boot/map is not written to the
partition sector of /dev/hda? Or not flushed correctly or something?
After reboot the old kernel came up again (though it was moved to
vmlinuz.old).
