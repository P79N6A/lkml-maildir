I have a ton of drives plugged into some promise IDE cards and my
motherboard's builtin ICH5 that I use for testing things.
I have not been seeing IRQ problems.  However, when I have both
the promise and the intel IDE drivers built into the kernel,
there _is_ some sortof a race condition present, such that
stat("/", &statbuf) returns the wrong value for statbuf.st_rdev
about 50% of the time when booting.  Instead of returning the
major/minor with the correct values (/dev/hda2 on the ICH5), it
instead returns some value from one of the drives on the promise
card such as /dev/hdh or some such.  I've tried tracking that
down, but havn't been able to squash it thus far.  Grrrr.
