What about the new network cards which can do checksums in hardware?
Also, the decreased memory usage is also a (not as significant) win.
Albeit, the architecture to support hardware checksums isn't in place,
but that can be worked on.

Hmm, caching checksums? I wonder how that would work. It would only work
on data which is somewhat repeated. This would probably be a no win for
encrypted data. Albeit, I haven't read the paper yet, so I dunno how it
works.
