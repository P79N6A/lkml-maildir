Thanks....
So: we seem to have two different approaches to solving this problem.
One is to stop any other thread from calling dentry_iput while the
umount is running generic_shutdown_super.  This cannot be done with
the PF_MEMALLOC trick and so would require calls to prune_dcache to
state their intentions (e.g. pass a 'struct super_block *').
With this approach, generic_shutdown_super needs to wait for stray
pruning to finish after marking the superblock as being unmounted, and
before shrinking the dcache.
The other is to allow other threads to call dentry_iput at any time,
but to keep track of them, and to wait for all to finish after
pruning all the filesystem's dentries.  This requires the extra
locking in prune_one_dentry to make sure we dput the parent before
releasing dcache_lock.
Of these two, I prefer the former, because fiddling with the locking
in prune_one_dentry is rather intrusive.
Also, the recent 
   nfs-permit-filesystem-to-override-root-dentry-on-mount.patch 
patch in -mm means that generic_shutdown_super does not call
prune_dcache but has it's own pruning code.  This means there is no
longer a need to pass intentions to prune_dcache.  Prune_dcache can
always ignore dentries with s->root==NULL, and shrink_dcache_sb only
works with it's own dentries.
So: blending the better bits of various patches together, I've come up
with the following.  It still needs a changelog entry, but does anyone
want to ACK it ???
Thanks,
NeilBrown
