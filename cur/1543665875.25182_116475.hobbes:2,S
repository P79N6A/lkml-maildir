After a little more digging in drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c, it 
seems that Jens might be the best person to discuss the 
following with.
Apparently I have a system that is making bio requests of a size 
that exceeds the max sector size for the device? How is that 
possible, and more to the point, how can I help get it fixed? 
Or am I misinterpreting something?
