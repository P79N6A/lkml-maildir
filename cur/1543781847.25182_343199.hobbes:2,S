Yes, that's why I have resisted the "just add the PCI ID" patches that 
have cropped up.
SiS submitted patches that duplicated portions of libata inside their 
driver, rather than simply fixing libata as would be proper.
So we are stuck in the middle :(
Someone needs to work with the SiS submission until it's kosher with the 
upstream kernel, then everybody will be happy.
