No.. these drivers dont call DMA mapping api's.. thats the problem.

In the intro we had outlined a way to handle this via a generic unity
map for all devices, we could do that, i.e
- implement a generic 1-1 map if the device is not calling dma api's and 
dynamically dissociate it if the device does start using dma apis.
For some of the addr reservation as well, we could use set_dma_mask() 
to ensure there is some dma space. Problem is some drivers may not use 
dma apis. Also it might be difficult to address device hotplugged that 
has a weird requirement.
