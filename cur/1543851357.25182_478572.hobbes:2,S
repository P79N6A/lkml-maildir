I don't quite follow.  If the branch is taken, err is -ENOMEM.  If the
branch is not taken, err is set to 0 with the next instruction.
Both methods definitely work.  Whether one is preferrable over the
other is imo 90% taste and maybe 10% better code on some architecture.
So just pick what you prefer.
