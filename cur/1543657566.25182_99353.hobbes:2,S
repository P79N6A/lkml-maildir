I'm running an ATI OEM (Xelo) Radeon 8500 with a NEC MultiSync 1535VI 
panel connected via DVI-D. X runs well with the latest fglrx driver 
from ATI as well as with the OpenSource radeon driver. When booting, 
the framebuffer does not initialize (see below). With older versions of 
ATI's driver (fglr200) I also had problems with the 
panel-size-detection, too: I had to start X 3 to 10 times before it 
started fine. Once running, there were no further probs.
Is there a possebility to skip the auto-detection of the panel size at 
boot time by setting it manual (via bootparams or compiling it into the 
kernel)?
--- Kernel output ---
