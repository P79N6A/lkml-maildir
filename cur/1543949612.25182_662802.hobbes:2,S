Hi again.
Ok, I just tried doing the same thing on my M1330.  It behaves 
differently to yours in that a small section of music repeats again 
and again until the disk is ejected, and then carries on (I was using 
RealPlayer with a local file as a simple test).
And it does look like other things stop working while the disk is 
ejected - screen updates freeze and network too I think.
I'm going to be travelling for the next few days, so I won't be able 
to try anything else till later in the week.
Regards,
    Mike.
