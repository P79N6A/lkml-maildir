You basically do a query for each page fault and an insert for each mmap
and a remove for each munmap thus AVL gives better performances.

I just implemented RB trees in the kernel with a reusable implementation
exactly like include/linux/list.h for the lists.
If somebody find this interesting I can provide a patch to add the
include/linux/rbtree.h and lib/rbtree.c that will provde rbtree support.
