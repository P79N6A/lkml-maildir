Maybe I used the wrong words... But you are right: It has to be opt-in! A 
change in the kernel sources which automagically sends data, regardless 
what kind of data, to somewhere in the net must not be enabled by default.
But until klive is implemented one day it is interesting thinking about 
what possibilities (and maybe even possible misuse) such a data 
collection has. What data does klive send? Is the data just a hash of
different system variables or is it also possible to identify one single 
computer (or person)? Data protection...laws etc. are things that must be 
considered too maybe.
I think the problem is not the technical implementation. The bigger 
problem is the data, where it comes from and the most interesting point 
what to do with it at the end.
