Hi all,
This patch has been in my patch directory for a while.
The PLEB is a SA-1100-based ARM computer developed at CSE at the
University of New South Wales.  I have discovered some of the earlier
models would not set register 1 properly, which was required for Linux
to boot.  This was inside their (very old) kernel tree but which they 
never submitted for inclusion (?)  It is a Photon1 with catapult
bootloader combination.
	- G.
