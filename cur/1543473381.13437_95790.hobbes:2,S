First of all, hello and greetings to everybody in this much honorable
list. Now let's get down to business. :)
I just noticed that 2.0.36 explicitly complains about gcc 2.8.x and
requires a patch in order to be compiled by this gcc version. I took a
look at the patch source and saw all the changes have something to do
with assembly/machine-specific directive syntax changes and the like. It
also has an ominous warning about the changes not having been tested.
I already applied the patch and put everything to work, no problem. I
just got squeamish about that warning. What could go wrong? Or can I
sleep well at night? The machine in question is our ISP's proxy server.
Cheers,
