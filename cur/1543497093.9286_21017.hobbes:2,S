Hi.
	In the linux/crypto/des.c from the 2.2.9 international patch, there is
a section of code in des_set_key() that always rejects my keys. I was hoping
someone could explain the purpose of this bit of code, and maybe why it
doesnt seem to like any of my keys.

	Here is the code snip: (for all my keys, the conditional is true. If I
just skip this check, everything seems to work ok.)
int des_set_key(struct cipher_context *cx,
                u8 *key, int keybytes)
{
    register u32 n, w;
    register char * b0, * b1;
    char bits0[56], bits1[56];
.....
    /* check for bad parity and weak keys */
    b0 = parity;
    n  = b0[key[0]]; n <<= 4;
    n |= b0[key[1]]; n <<= 4;
    n |= b0[key[2]]; n <<= 4;
    n |= b0[key[3]]; n <<= 4;
    n |= b0[key[4]]; n <<= 4;
    n |= b0[key[5]]; n <<= 4;
    n |= b0[key[6]]; n <<= 4;
    n |= b0[key[7]];
    w  = 0X88888888L;
    /* report bad parity in key */
    if ( n & w )
        return -1;
==========
	Any info appreciated.
