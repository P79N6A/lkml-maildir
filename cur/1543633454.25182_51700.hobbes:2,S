Frame pointer - used to reference the function return state, and function
arguments.  Optional.
Stack pointer - used to reference the function local variables.  In the
absence of the frame pointer, this is also used to reference the function
return state and the function arguments.
As you can see, it has nothing to do with task switch mechanisms.
I suggest you revise your "pascal and gdb" and "task switch mechanism"
knowledge.  I don't believe ARM is special in doing the above.  In fact,
the above is probably very common indeed.
