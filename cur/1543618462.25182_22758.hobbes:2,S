I just finished testing the patch, and it shows huge temperature savings
(10 to 15C when idle).  The problem is, it screws up v4l (bttv), usb
keyboard under X becomes effectively unusable, etc.
V4l - using xinerama, xvideo, v4l under X4.1.0.1 - the picture gets
jagged lines through it (offset scanlines maybe?) and tends to be jumpy.
usb keyboard - its slightly bad under X anyway (sticky keys, modifiers,
etc) but with this patch I had to log in from another system just to
shut down - even ctrl-alt-delete wouldn't work. In about 15 mins of
arguing with it I probably got 20 keystrokes into the xserver. (mouse
continued to work fine however.)
Seems like a great idea, if these problems can be solved. I'd love to
get my cpu back down to 30C on a regular basis ;)
(Currently running the same kernel w/o amd_disconnect=yes and it isn't
showing any problems at all.)
Motherboard is an Iwill kk266 (kt133) w/ a 1.2G tbird, 512M ram, 2
aic7xxx (one pcb w/ pci bridge)
Primary video: nvidia geforce2 mx (yah yah but it works ;) ..)
Second/Third video: matrox mga g100 (4port card, 2 ports in use)
Also, I noticed an odd problem w/ ACPI. dmesg shows:
ACPI: Power Button (FF) found
ACPI: Multiple power buttons detected, ignoring fixed-feature
ACPI: Power Button (CM) found
..and:
 ls -l /proc/acpi/button/
