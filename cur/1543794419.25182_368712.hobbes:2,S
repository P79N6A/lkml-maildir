And here's a shell script that will automatically create a mini.conf from a 
standard .config file.
It does this via the simple expedient of trying to remove each line and seeing 
which ones make any difference to the generated .config.  (This means it runs 
make allnoconfig about 1300 times.  This is very very slow, so it displays a 
progress indicator.)
To use the script, go into the kernel source directory, create your .config 
file (via menuconfig or however), rename that .config file to something else 
(like "myconfig"), then run the script like so:
./miniconfig.sh myconfig
(Note you still have to be in the directory where the script can run "make 
allnoconfig".)  When it finishes, you should have a mini.conf containing the 
minimal set  of lines necessary to specify that configuration via
"make KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG=mini.config allnoconfig".
I'm sure there's a better way to do this, but this works now.
