The recommended practive today is:
In some relevant Kconfig file add:
config HAVE_MODULE_SECTION_STUBS
	bool
And then in arch/$ARCH/Kconfig do:
config PARISC
	...
	select HAVE_MODULE_SECTION_STUBS
	...
The select are supposed to be sorted alphabetically
but people seems to use a different alphabet for
each arch.
