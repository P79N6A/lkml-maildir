     How is that different from what I proposed, other than the
requirement to pass the swap data stuctures between the two kernels?
     Even if you only expect hibernation to work only _most of the
time_, suspending to swap means allocating a bunch of swap space that
you intend to never be used as swap.  The two functions don't really
belong together.
