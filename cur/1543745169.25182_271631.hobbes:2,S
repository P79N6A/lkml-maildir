Hi Avi,
> I recently posted a patch which fixes the problem; see attached.
thanks for the patch. I will try it. According to another tip i disabled EFI 
GUID partition support and activated USB debugging. The Ipod is working 
without problems with this config. I'll now try only the GUID support 
disabled but again deactivating USB debugging. I will also try your patch. 
Greetings, Joerg
