macserial is obsolete on 2.6. it should be removed. pmac_zilog is the
replacement.
I still haven't found the bug with pmac_zilog that caused the occasional
crash on boot on the G5 though (it seems to be a subtle race, I haven't
found anything wrong with pmac_zilog itself), but then, I've been
quite busy with other things latey.
