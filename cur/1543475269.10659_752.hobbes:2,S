Hi,
Are your net-tools up to date?
Also, Documentation/Changes has:
   "If for some reason you need to override this automatic default
routing, you have to specify the complete route specification (netmask,
device, etc.) for the kernel to accept it. Consequently, you need to
either remove interface routes from your init scripts or add missing
information to them if you need to replace the automatic routes."
Does this imply that you don't need to remove the routes, just re-add them
with the extra information?
Hope this helps - if not, my excuse is that it's late & I'm tired.
Cheers,
Steve
