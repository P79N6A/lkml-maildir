Marcello, Andrey
I believe this patch is wrong.
First, it prevent nothing: NMI watchdog is a signal that you wait too 
long with disabled interrupts. Your controller was not answered too 
long, obviously it is a hardware issue.
Second, you could not call schedule() with io_request_lock spinlock taken.
You should unlock io_request_lock before msleep, like in latest versions 
of megaraid2 drivers.
Please fix it.
Thank you,
      Vasily Averin, SWSoft Linux Kernel Team

#   Ok, msleep() backported, but driver isn't fixed. This patch
#   acceptable?

#   Prevent NMI oopser kill kernel thread when megaraid2 driver waiting
