The latter.  A ring is optimal for processing a huge number of requests, but 
if you're really going to be firing off syslet threads all over the place 
you're not going to be optimal anyway.  And being able to point the return 
value to the stack or into some datastructure is way nicer to code (zero 
setup == easy to understand and easy to convert).

Unfortunately, waiting for someone to write a killer app which uses your new 
API is the road to disappointment.  The real target is convincing the handful 
of important apps (Samba, Apache, ...) to #ifdef around some small piece of 
code in order to get performance.  And a mere single design wart could mean 
that never happens.  Look at epoll, it's probably been the most successful 
and it's still damn niche.

Is replacing epoll with syslets really going to win, even if you're writing 
apps from scratch?  Anyway a fast notification mechanism is a different 
problem than syslets, and should be separated.

This must be solved, yet all avenues seem crawling with worms.  Redirecting 
find_task_by_pid() to find the original and converting all the places where 
we return tids to userspace?  Swapping tids when we clone?  Duplicate tids, 
with only the non-syslet one being returned from find_task_by_pid()?

Let's just tell Ingo it's impossible to solve :)
