Hah!
I haven't seen Mark post any follow-ups to this, but I have some more 
information of my own.
Mark, are you running the IPW2200 drivers, by any chance?  I'm pretty sure 
that's what is causing the lock-ups on my end; that, or something in the the 
kernel's wireless handlers.
I did hook up an ethernet cable and started doing netconsole traces... only 
then the problem disappeared!  To make a long story short, the system is 
entirely stable when running network over ethernet, but when I use the 
wireless network interface, it eventually locks up.  There are no error 
messages that I can associate with the wireless device or network traffic.
