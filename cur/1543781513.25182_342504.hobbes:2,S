An LFS from April 05, with the stock 50-udev.rules, 25-lfs.rules (which 
doesn't do anything suspicious, I think; certainly nothing related to my 
problem).
25-lfs.rules does duplicate some of the things in 50-udev.rules, but I think 
that's deliberate (they want to interfere with the stock install as little as 
possible, and the overrides take precedence). I've put my /etc/udev directory 
unmodified up here:
http://devzero.co.uk/~alistair/udev/
If I reinstall 053 and reboot, everything that's broken on 067 works again. Do 
you need a specific hotplug installed?
