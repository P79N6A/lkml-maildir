Subject: [PATCH] late spinlock initialization in ieee1394/ohci
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

spinlock used in irq handler should be initialized before registering
irq, even if we know that our device has interrupts disabled; handler
is registered shared and taking spinlock is done unconditionally.  As
it is, we can and do get oopsen on boot for some configuration, depending
on irq routing - I've got a reproducer.
