There are three downsides with the slab-like approach: internal
fragmentation, under-utilized slabs, and pinning.
The first is the situation where we ask for a kmalloc of 33 bytes and
get 64. I think the average kmalloc wastes about 30% trying to fit into
power-of-two buckets. We can tune our buckets a bit, but I think in
general trying to back kmalloc with slabs is problematic. SLOB has a
2-byte granularity up to the point where it just hands things off to the
page allocator.
If we tried to add more slabs to fill the gaps, we'd exacerbate the
second problem: because only one type of object can go on a slab, a lot
of slabs are half-full. SLUB's automerging of slabs helps some here, but
is still restricted to objects of the same size.
And finally, there's the whole pinning problem: we can have a cache like
the dcache grow very large and then contract, but still have most of its
slabs used by pinned dentries. Christoph has some rather hairy patches
to address this, but SLOB doesn't have much of a problem here - those
pages are still available to allocate other objects on.
By comparison, SLOB's big downsides are that it's not O(1) and it has a
single lock. But it's currently fast enough to keep up with SLUB on
kernel compiles on my 2G box and Nick had an allocator benchmark where
scalability didn't fall off until beyond 4 CPUs.

I think we should probably just accept that it makes sense to have more
than one allocator. A 64MB single CPU machine is very, very different
than a 64TB 4096-CPU machine. On one of those, it probably makes some
sense to burn some memory for maximum scalability.
