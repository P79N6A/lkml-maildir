The patch series looks like a nice cleanup, except for a few things in 
this patch.

I don't think there is. "tmp" is not being passed to kallsyms to be 
filled with a symbol name, but it's being used to hold a name written by 
the user to lookup an address.
If the powerpc/xmon people feel that 63 characters is enough to hold a 
symbol name, it's their problem, but there is no buffer overflow.

This one seems ok, since "tmpstr" is used everywhere to hold symbol names.

This one is completely out of the blue. Why "sizeof(tmpstr) / 2"?
It would make more sense to use "sizeof(tmpstr) - 1", but either way it 
is a change in behavior.

This also introduces a change in behavior. It is still a nice cleanup, 
though. So, if the powerpc people feel they can spare an extra 64 bytes 
of stack here, I guess it's ok.
