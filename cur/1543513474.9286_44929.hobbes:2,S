The Requirements for Internet Hosts RFC dictates
that such an inbound datagram must be silently discarded anyway.
(You are not allowed to use a zero as the host source address, 
except in the specific case of 0.0.0.0, and then only during 
bootup from the network). -RFC 1122
So,it would appear Linux is only doing what is required of it here.
(Must silently discard such an inbound packet).
