i have released the 2.6.16-rc6-rt7 tree, which can be downloaded from 
the usual place:
   
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
the main change in this release is the merge up to John Stultz's GTOD 
-B20 patchset, and Thomas Gleixner's latest -hrt (high resolution 
timers) queue. This, amongst many other fixes, resolves a system-time 
(and uptime) anomaly observable under high load.
Changes since -rt4:
 - merge to John Stultz's GTOD -B20 (Thomas Gleixner)
 - merge to latest -hrt (Thomas Gleixner)
 - zap_pte_range() latency breaker (Hugh Dickins)
 - small latency tracer cleanups
to build a 2.6.16-rc6-rt7 tree, the following patches should be applied:
  
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.15.tar.bz2
  
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/patch-2.6.16-rc6.bz2
