No, 50ms is still too much, I'd consider every instance of 'mdelay'
to be a bug in general, except maybe with exceptionally broken
hardware, which I don't think this is.
The reason that it gave you an oops is that you call it from
a tasklet. You have to convert the tasklet to a workqueue at the
same time if you want to sleep inside it. In fact, it might
be a good idea to convert all the tasklets in that driver
to use schedule_work instead.
