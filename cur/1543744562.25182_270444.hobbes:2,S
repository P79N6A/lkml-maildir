Have you looked at what sungem/sungem_phy does ?
Among others, sungem has an algorithm for automatically testing fallback
forced speeds when aneg fails, which has proven useful with a variety of
PHY/hub combos, plus a "magic_aneg" bit in the PHY definition for PHYs
taht can do that themselves automatically.
Also, besides shutdown(), you probably want a suspend() callback used by
the MAC driver when the machine is entering a suspend() state (I
definitely need that with various PHYs on powermacs) along with the
various WOL parameters.
