Reuse the size argument of epoll_create, however the size must be smaller than the max file descriptor number: ether the resource limitation or the compiling time limitation.

Hum, you should read this :
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.7-rc3/2.6.7-rc3-mm2/broken-out/epoll-uses-rbtrees.patch
Your patch is a revert of this change, it probably wont be accepted.
epoll_ctl() is scalable, since it's O(log2(N)) : With 1 millions files
descriptors, that means less than 20 nodes to lookup in the tree.
In what situation do you think epoll_ctl() performance is bad ?
