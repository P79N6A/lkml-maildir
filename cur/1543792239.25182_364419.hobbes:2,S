If module A depends on module B, and "modprobe A" and "modprobe B" are 
run parallel, there is time window when module B is already listed in 
/proc/modules, but not completely loaded/initialized, it is in the state 
"Loading". At this point "modprobe A" checks /proc/modules if module B 
is already loaded, but it does not take into account that it is in the 
state "Loading" and not yet "Live". So it tries to load module A, but it 
fails, because there are missing symbols because module A did not 
register them yet.
