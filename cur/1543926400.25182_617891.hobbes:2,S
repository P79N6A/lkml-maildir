just to confuse things, i just got a crash with the twiddled network 
setup :-/ I have reverted the same-name optimization and have got a 
similar crash again. So this angle is a red herring.
now that it's reproducible again i'll try more direct debugging. 
(Networking might not even be the cause of this - that was just a quick 
first impression that i had.)
Btw., the .config is the result of automated "make randconfig" x86 
bootup testing QA, so there might be weird combinations in the .config. 
That's how SLOB got randomly enabled in the first place, i dont normally 
use SLOB kernels.
