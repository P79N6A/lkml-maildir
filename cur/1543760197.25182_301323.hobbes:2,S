Ok, after some investigation into the files I was able to find out the 
problem.
scripts/kallsyms.c uses a subset of the symbol table to optimize the 
tokens to use to compress the symbols. It does this because using the 
complete set of symbols would be much slower without a significant gain 
in compression.
For some reason, in the files sent by Dominik, two aliased symbols 
change places from the first to the second step of the kallsyms build 
process (__sched_text_start, __down).
Because of this, the subset used for optimization is different and so 
are the tokens selected, producing a 2 byte difference in the total size 
of the compressed symbol names :P
So I must change the sampling algorithm in a way that is robust to 
symbol position changes.
A simple and robust way is to do the sampling on a list of symbols 
sorted by symbol name. This way, even if the symbol positions that are 
given to scripts/kallsyms change, the symbols sampled will be the same.
I'll do the patch to do this and send it ASAP.
