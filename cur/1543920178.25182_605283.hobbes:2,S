 I do not think it should have relied on it in any way or otherwise 
"select" should have been used.  I recall confusion around this driver and 
even recently some breakage happened as a result of some fiddling with 
include/asm-mips/mach-generic/ide.h and the fact this platform is 
legacy-free -- there is nothing decoding subtractively on the PCI bus (no 
south bridge of any kind) and blind pokes at presumed ISA addresses result 
in bus error exceptions.
 I'll have a look at it in due course.
