The question is if they do it in a way I can read. If I can read it, I
can fix it. There was too much noise inside e2fs to see a point or points
of intercept. So the intercept has to be higher, and ..

But not correct behaviour wrt metadata in a shared disk fs. And your
calculation of "maximum performance" is off. Look, you seem to forget
this:
   suppose that I make the FS twice as slow as before by meddling with
   it to make it sharable
   then I simply share it among 4 nodes to get a two times _speed up_
   overall.
That's the basic idea. Details left to reader.
I.e. I don't care if it gets slower. We are talking thousands of nodes
here. Only the detail of the topology is affected by the real numbers.

Garbage collection. I assume that either there is a point at which the
dcache is swept or as I free a dentry from the cache its dependents
are swept. I don't know which. Feel free to enlighten me. My question
is simply "is doing a dput of the base directory dentry on the FS
enough to clear the dcache for that FS"?
