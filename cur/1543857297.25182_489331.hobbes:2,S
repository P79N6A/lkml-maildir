The problem is that -stable patches should not introduce regression.
And if this patch would be included in the next -stable release,
people who upgrade to this release may get unexpected changes of sound
cards indexes.  This may be OK for a new 2.6.x release, but not for a
new 2.6.16.y.

Yes, now I have exactly the same setup.  But before this patch I did
not have any index=N assignments in my configuration; after the patch
I needed to add them to get my system working as before.

I don't question the need for this patch in mainline; however, it does
not seem to be suitable for -stable.

Currently I get:
VIA 82xx Modem: probe of 0000:00:11.6 failed with error -13
on every boot (and snd_via82xx_modem module in memory).  Not a grave
bug, but not a good thing either (and another reason for not adding
this patch to 2.6.16.y).
