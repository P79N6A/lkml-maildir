We've tested clone_startup() with real threads on a 2.4-backported version
of yesterday's final TLS API quite extensively, and it works as expected.  
(as we've tested earlier incarnations of the TLS API and code as well.)
This portion of the code is not changed by CLONE_SETTLS - so it should
work equally well, unless i've done something stupid ... I'll backport
this and will fit glibc to the new API later today. (Ulrich's on LW)

this was just me shortening some code a bit. I've attached a new patch
that gets rid of those unrelated changes and does the CLONE_SETTLS /
CLONE_SETTID bits only.
