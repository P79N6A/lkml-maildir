Unfortunately, this is not as easy on logfs, because there is no point
in allocating a block when there is no data to write into it. Fragmentation
on flash media is free, but you can never modify a block in place without
erasing it first. This means it will always be written to a new location
on the next write access.
One option that might work (similar to what you describe in your other mail)
is to have a per-inode count of reserved blocks, without allocating specific
blocks for them. The journal then needs to maintain the number of total
reserved blocks for all files and keep that in sync with blocks that were
reserved for specific inodes.
