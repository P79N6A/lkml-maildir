- Each 2.6.x.y series would be abandanded after the next 2.6.x release
  came out.
- There would be no big development fork.
Those are two ways this differs.

Have you looked into the kernel-janitor project?  That's the best
"breeding" ground around for people who want to learn the kernel
development process.  I highly recommend that.
I don't think this "stable/bugfix" release series would be a good place
for new hackers, as most first bugfixes are of the janitorial type,
which would not be accepted into such a release tree.
