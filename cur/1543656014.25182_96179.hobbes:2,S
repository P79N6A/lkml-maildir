James,
 the fbcon update seems to have broken the plain VGA console. I get a page
fault at vgacon_scroll+0x144, the call sequence seems to be:
	vt_console_print+0x203
	set_cursor+0x78
	vgacon_cursor+x0xb5
	scrup+0x122
	vgacon_scroll+0x144
I don't know what triggers it, since it seems to happen pretty randomly.
