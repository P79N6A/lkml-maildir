I'd bet that some process early in the boot adjusts your system time.
Then this is expected behavior. This is why I would have preferred the 
simple back-out patch for the boot times problem.
I'm sorry I fell of the net for so long and didn't stand up for the 
simpler change in this case. Oh well.
I'll probably supply a back-out patch for -mm then, after wading through
my multi-megabyte email backlog (sorry John, still need to read your time
keeping proposal and all its discussion).
