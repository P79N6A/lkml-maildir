Subject: [2.6 patch] remove drivers/char/tpqic02.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/2/5/69

Since at about half a year, this driver was no longer selectable via
Kconfig.
Since it seems noone missed this driver, therefore this patch removes
it.
