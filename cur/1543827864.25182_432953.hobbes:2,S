If BSD supports it why can't Linux?  
Yes.  My code works great on HP-UX but does nothing on
Linux.  It will not compile because it can't find
SO_REUSEPORT.  I don't have the exact error message at
hand, but I could send it if it would help.  If I
switch to SO_REUSEADDR the code compiles but the
server does not receive anything.
Thanks,
