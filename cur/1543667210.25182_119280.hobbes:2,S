I'm having that message sent to logs too many times when i have a blank
disc on my drive.
Is there any way to have that message sent only once unles the disc
remains in the drive ??
I had a 700Gb log file one night i forgot to unplug the CD-RW with an
empty disc
Sorry for the silly question, I dont know a lot of C, and even less
kernel coding.
the problem is line 2648 on drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c
cdinfo(CD_WARNING,"This disc doesn't have any tracks I recognize!\n");
I could comment that line out, but i would love a better solution before
recompiling my kernel. btw. this is on 2.4.21pre5-ac3.
Thanks for any comment
Max
