i have left it that way on purpose. There is no reason to assume that the
timeslice will get smaller after a fork. If we do anything like that then
we should reset the _parent's_ timeslice ... (thats the typical fork()
usage pattern: parent forks a child and goes sleeping [ie. waiting for
results] shortly afterwards).
