   I've been running it for 2 weeks with Exodus without a single problem,
as far as I know (one week with a test data base, one week on the
production data base as well as the test). I've had one wierd thing happen
starting yesterday, but I haven't found out what is causing it yet, and
have no reason right now to suspect the raw devices. I don't know if you
wanted a general answer, or just one for those 2 data bases specifically.
But I've been meaning to let Stephen know some time soon, anyway.
