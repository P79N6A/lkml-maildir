This is contrary to C99 standeard annex H2.2 
(
http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf
):
"An implementation that defines signed integer types as also being modulo need
not detect integer overflow, in which case, only integer divide-by-zero need
be detected."
So if it doesn't properly defines wrapping it has to detect integer 
overflow, right?
gcc does niether with that optimization :-(
