If there is a better list for this, let me know and I'll take the question
there.
I have a new CDRW I've been trying to get working for a couple of months
now.  Working with autoloading the modules anyway.
I've tried following the CD-Writing HOWTO for setting up modules.conf with
no luck.
Currently my modules.conf has:
options ide-cd ignore=hdc            # tell the ide-cd module to ignore h
alias block-major-11 sr_mod          # load sr_mod upon access of scd0
pre-install sg     modprobe ide-scsi # load ide-scsi before sg
pre-install sr_mod modprobe ide-scsi # load ide-scsi before sr_mod
pre-install ide-scsi modprobe ide-cd # load ide-cd   before ide-scsi
And lilo.conf has:
append="hdc=scsi"
Of course, also tried hdc=ide-scsi with same results.
Now, if I try something like ``head /dev/scd0''  I see the following in
dmesg:
SCSI subsystem driver Revision: 1.00
Uniform CD-ROM driver unloaded
And the following in /var/log/ksymoops:
20011024 214049 start /sbin/modprobe -s -k -- block-major-11 safemode=1
20011024 214050 probe ended
Now, if I take the command from that:
/sbin/modprobe -s -k -- block-major-11
I get the following:
thune:~# /sbin/modprobe -s -k -- block-major-11

20011024 214924 probe ended
20011024 214924 probe ended
20011024 214924 probe ended
And dmesg shows:
CSI subsystem driver Revision: 1.00
ide-cd: ignoring drive hdc
scsi0 : SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices
  Vendor: PHILIPS   Model: PCRW804           Rev:  2,1

sr0: scsi3-mmc drive: 32x/32x writer cd/rw xa/form2 cdda tray

So, it appears to me that the autoloading should work.  But it's not.
What am I missing?
Help appreciated,
