For gcc >= 3.1, we are already telling the compiler that it should 
either inline the code or abort compilation.
"extern inline" doesn't make much sense. And it gives a warning with 
-Wmissing-prototypes.
I'm currently cleaning up warnings with -Wmissing-prototypes to get them 
to an acceptable level. -Wmissing-prototypes will help us to enforce a 
coding style that will avoid a class of nasty runtime errors that are 
currently sometimes hitting us.
