RH9's /sbin/installkernel tries to run /sbin/new-kernel-pkg in order to
build a new initrd. This will almost certainly fail if your modules
directory isn't already populated at this point.
make modules_install; make install
in that order solves the problem.
If you don't like RH's installkernel then you can always write
your own and put it in ~/bin. That's what I did a long time ago
to make it lilo-friendly. (RH prefers that POS grub.)

It hasn't before. I doubt very many people have a major problem with it.
