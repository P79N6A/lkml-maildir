All of my technical arguments on this topic were nicely obliterated by
Andrew.  The only real reason remaining (that I know of) is that I want
to first eliminate all things which are a barrier to inclusion before
dealing with this because it requires man hours to fix it.  If you want
to send us a cleanup patch that fixes it, I would be grateful for your
time donatioin.
