This is correct behaviour. Nobody building his kernel for a pc will ever want 
his keyboard not to function until the module is loaded; the 
CONFIG_SERIO_I8042 option is really only there for embedded devices based on 
x86 processors which don't have an i8042 keyboard controller, which is where 
the EMBEDDED option was made for. Modularizing this would effectively disable 
the possibility of booting with init=/bin/sh.
