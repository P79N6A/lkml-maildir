Not helpful.
The CPU ordering constraints for "test_and_set_bit()" and friends are weak 
enough that even if you have a full memory clobber, it still wouldn't work 
as a lock.
That's exactly why we have smp_mb__after_set_bit() and friends. On some 
architectures (arm, mips, parsic, powerpc), *that* is where the CPU memory 
barrier is, because the "test_and_set_bit()" itself is just a 
cache-coherent operation, not an actual barrier.
