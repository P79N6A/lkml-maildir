nice! I've added this to the -rt tree and have released -rt18.

this should definitely be cleaned up. There are a couple of periodic VM 
threads you could do this from - but none is really per-CPU. So my 
suggestion would be to do the check_pgt_cache() from desched_thread() - 
which is an rt-specific cleanup thread. You dont even have to make it 
ia64-specific i think.
