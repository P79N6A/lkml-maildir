Hi,
**** Please BCC me in on any reply, not CC me.  Two reasons, I am not
on the LKML, and second I am suffering BIG time with SPAM from posting
to the mailing list.  Thanks in advance. *****
Sorry I made a few bad typo and incoherrent statements in my last
eMail.  I am very tired and very short on sleep due to some major
construction work in my building.  Please see below for important
corrections.

Ignore the "-PentiumK6-SMP-ow3" line above, part of my cut and paste
activity.

Umm, now this make no sense at all above, trying again:
EXTRAVERSION = -PentiumK6-SMP-ow3
Worked just fine with the supporting and dependant on the Kernel in
some manner programs.

Please BCC me by replacing yahoo.com after the "@" as follows"
TLD =         The last three letters of the word internet
Domain name = The first four letters of the word software,
              followed by the first four letters of the word
              homeless.
My appologies in advance for the jumbled eMail address
and request to BCC me, but SPAM has become a very serious
problem.  The eMail address in my header information is
not a valid eMail address for me.  I needed to use a valid
domain due to ISP SMTP screen rules.[unhandled content-type:application/pgp-signature]
