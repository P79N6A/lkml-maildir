Hi Steffen!
Have you tried to compile the kernel with the setup that caused the
kernel panic? e2fsck and make {,b}zImage are real stress test for the
memory subsystem and are often the applications that show you your
hardware failures, although win et al. seem to run fine.
I'd get a new DIMM from the vendor.
