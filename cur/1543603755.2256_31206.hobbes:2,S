This is precisely my point as well:  You've made all the drivers that must be 
able to do this type of mapping assume the worst case because we cannot now 
have any window into the iommu if there is one.
Worse still, every driver that needs this feature is doing it on its own, so 
the code for doing this in usb-ohci is different from the code in the 
sym53c8xx driver etc.  We're now duplicating this fairly subtle and complex 
code all over the driver base.
At the very least, providing an API to do this will get us away from all the 
error prone duplication.  And if it's going to be an API, it might as well be 
architecture specific and iommu aware so it functions in the simplest and 
fastest way.

I agree that some people are very prone to abusing the tools provided to them. 
 I cannot agree that this is a good reason not to provide the tools in the 
first place.  This is the type of argument usually heard from lawmakers and 
politicians.  The linux community is better than that:  we have a review 
process for new drivers.  We even have a bunch of people who trawl through the 
old code looking for mistakes and problems who would probably be more that 
willing to send in patches for abuse of this API.  Can we not educate the 
community (document the API properly) and rely on it to make the correct 
choices?
