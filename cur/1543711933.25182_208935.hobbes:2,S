And I would consider an error that happens after atomic copy critical. If
this happens all attempts to draw progress bar, etc. should be stopped and
suspend should probably abort as well.
What happens if swsusp1 gets such an error during atomic phase? Will it
continue or abort? If it continues I would imagine user not noticing the
message it it flashes the split second before the box powers off.
