Have you compiled IPv6 as a module but compiled TCP
itself into the kernel rather than as a module? I'm
not sure if it can link like this . . . I had this
problem with 2.2.16 where many modules (sound,
soundcore, etc) had a dependancy upon the module
loader and could not find the dependancy because I had
compiled the kernel so the module loader was internal.
The problem was fixed when I recompiled with an
external module loader.
