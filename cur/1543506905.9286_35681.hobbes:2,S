Subject: Should this list be split between RELEASE and DEVELOPMENT??

In the wake of last week's spam attack, and the subsequent cleanup
performed by folks like David Miller, should we take time to reorganize
the mailing list?
I would personally like two lists, one for released kernel (2.0, 2.2) issues
and another for developmemt kernels (2.3, etc). There is a _lot_ of traffic
on this list that I would love to automatically sort into separate mailboxes
based on the mailing list address.
For example, 'linux-kernel-rel' and 'linux-kernel-dev'.
