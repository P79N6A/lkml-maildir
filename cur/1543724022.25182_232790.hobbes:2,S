True. Below a simple example for hda and hdb.
Yes, having EDD 2.0 helps.

It was hdh: IOMEGA ZIP 100 ATAPI, ATAPI FLOPPY drive, with geometry
(probably 96/64/32, don't know why C and S are interchanged)
obtained from HDIO_GET_IDENTITY.

hda or hdb. Since that system boots from SCSI there is no reason to
prefer seeing the first or second IDE disk in the BIOS setup.
(Don't know anymore what the truth was.)

Also Linux can change disk order with boot option "ide=reverse".
