So you're saying, as regards "putting presentation format in ... the 
kernel", that we already have presentation formats specified pell-mell 
in the kernel.  That should then be a non-issue, because you aren't 
introducing anything new, just centralizing an existing kernel behavior. 
  Do I have you right?

Because you're just providing a range of basic output formats, 
standardized.  So anybody can ask for statistics from the kernel in a 
preferred output to then massage as needed in userland.  ACK?  Am I 
oversimplifying?
