Fine with me. I'll do the full analysis tonight, anyway, and try to write
down the rules for that stuff. One thing that makes me seriously uneasy
is the fact that VM knows about ->buffers - I would be much happier if all
this stuff would be contained in fs/buffer.c. IOW, I'm not sure that
block_flushpage()/try_to_free_buffers() is a happy camper.
I'm not proposing it for immediate inclusion, but I don't feel good about
all this code - current rules are too complex and rely on details of
VM/buffer interaction too much for my taste. It may be correct, but it's
not obviously correct...
