Most of the time, the bus driver kicks in *after* the device driver is
registered to the EISA framework (eisa is second to last in the driver
list, so if the driver is built-in, it is guaranted to init before the
root driver has a chance to discover the bus).
So, returning -ENODEV immediatly in this case prevents you from using
any built-in EISA driver. A possible solution to this problem would be
to move eisa just after the pci init (and even that would cause some
trouble, because the virtual_root driver would register before the
parisc root driver has a chance to be probed...).
So yes, this sucks, but I can't come up with a better solution...
