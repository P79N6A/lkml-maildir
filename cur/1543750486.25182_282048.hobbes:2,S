Ok. This is apparently a slab cache corruption issue.
Can you compile with SLAB_DEBUG and DEBUG_PAGEALLOC turned on, since that 
may well catch something in the act (or it may make the machine so 
unusably slow that it's not funny - who knows..)

Goodie. Maybe Alan already knows what it's about. Alan? Any slab 
corruption or wild pointers that you are aware of? However:

I suspect that it's more of the slab corruption thing, and Alan's patch 
ended up moving something around subtly enough that you don't get the 
crash, but instead get corrupted buffer heads or similar.. Your BTTV 
issues are interesting, though.
