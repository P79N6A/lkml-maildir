'Z' is an obsolete equivalent of standard 'z'.  That one is portable and it
is, indeed, available in userland (libc6 and anything C99-compliant).  To
quote the manpage:
       z      A  following  integer  conversion  corresponds  to  a  size_t or
              ssize_t argument. (Linux libc5 has Z with  this  meaning.  Don't
              use it.)
       t      A  following integer conversion corresponds to a ptrdiff_t argu-
              ment.
Please, do s/Zd/zd/.
One more thing: folks, please stop using crap like "%08x", (int)pointer.
It's not only non-portable (consider 64bit boxen), it's extra work for
no good reason.  "%p" is standard and will do the right thing with less
PITA.
