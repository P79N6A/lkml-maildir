Hi Uwe.
The thing is, nobody really reads your emails. Why?
 - you're too abrasive.
   Hey, I'm not the most polite person either, but when you complain about 
   other maintainers doing badly, you'd better try to show that you can do 
   better.
 - they are so horribly formatted that it's impossible to read them.
   Quote appropriately, and use correct whitespace. That means wrapping 
   long lines, proper paragraphs, and it means whitespace in between 
   paragraphs and the things you quote.
I really would suggest you try to fix these issues, as I strongly suspect 
that people skip over your messages as it is now.
