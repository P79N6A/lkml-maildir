Right, thanks.  (I had that one right, once, but must have
dropped it on the floor.)

OK, 
http://www.kegel.com/spell-fix-dan2.txt
 is up, with the
following changes:

The above covers errors in three or more source files.
The next logical step was to do the words misspelled in exactly
two source files.  I did gather a list of them
( 
http://www.kegel.com/errors2.txt
 ) but
I don't have the energy to make a corrections file for those
right now.  (FWIW, the procedure is: copy to a new file,
run aspell and consult original source, then use 'paste'
to join input and output of aspell into a two-column file)
