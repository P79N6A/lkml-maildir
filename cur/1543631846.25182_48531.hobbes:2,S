Subject: [PATCH] i386 arch subdivision into machine types for 2.5.18

This code rearranges the arch/i386 directory structure to allow for sliding 
additional non-pc hardware in here in an easily separable (and thus easily 
maintainable) fashion.  The idea is that all the code for the particular 
problem hardware should be able to go in a separate directory with only 
additional build options in config.in.
The current patch really only pulls out the visws code from the core and 
places it into a separate directory (sort of a simple example case).
This code is essentially just an up-port of the previously announced 2.5.15 
version.  In particular, I haven't added the extra documentation that I need 
to make the way the hooks work transparent to the interested user.  I'm 
currently marking time until Linus applies the Mochel setup/cpu split patches 
from the -dj tree and I can merge my code with it.
