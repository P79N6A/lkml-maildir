I don't think you could use only the tsc. From reviewing John, and
Thomas work it's pretty clear the TSC isn't going to work correctly all
the time.

It's possible for the TSC to change frequencies without notification. It
can also completely stop when the system goes idle.

What would be the benefit of using this over the vsyscall gettimeofday()
from userspace ?
