No, I should have been clear. The size of the map remains the same but 
mem_map does not point directly to NODE_DATA(0)->node_mem_map when the PFN 
of node 0 is not 0. Instead mem_map points to
NODE_DATA(0)->node_mem_map - NODE_DATA(0)->node_start_pfn
The relevant bit of code is
 	map = alloc_remap(pgdat->node_id, size);
 	if (!map)
 		map = alloc_bootmem_node(pgdat, size);
 	pgdat->node_mem_map = map + (pgdat->node_start_pfn - start);
 	/*
 	 * With FLATMEM the global mem_map is used.  This is assumed
 	 * to be based at pfn 0 such that 'pfn = page* - mem_map'
 	 * is true. Adjust map relative to node_mem_map to
 	 * maintain this relationship.
 	 */
 	map -= pgdat->node_start_pfn;
and later
 	if (pgdat == NODE_DATA(0))
 		mem_map = map;
So memory is wasted and ARCH_PFN_OFFSET isn't needed in the case where it 
is working around NODE_DATA(0)->node_start_pfn != 0

It would be a kick in the shins all right if that was the case.
