[GFP-Mask semantics discussion]
ok, once we are about it here, could you please explain the
_exact_ semantics for the GFP_XXX constants?
GFP_BUFFER
GFP_ATOMIC
GFP_BIGUSER
GFP_USER
GFP_KERNEL
GFP_NFS
GFP_KSWAPD
So which steps are tried to allocate these pages (freeing
process, freeing globally, waiting, failing, kswapd-wakeup)? 
Because it is not easy to decide from a driver writers point of
view, which one to use for which requests :(
Thanks and Regards
