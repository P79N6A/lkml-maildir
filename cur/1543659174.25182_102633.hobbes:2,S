I would like to see it stay within the kernel for the following reasons:
1) It works as it is for those who have QT
2) It's more appealing to some people with a grapical frontend
3) If it fails, people can revert back to menuconfig
4) It does not take up much space. ~2 files
The problem seems that some people does not like the QT choice.
But only one attemp has been made (that I know of) implementing
an alternative graphical frontend. (Romain Lievin - GTK)
I you do not like the QT version - don't use it.
If too many people post error - get it fixed.
Simple...
