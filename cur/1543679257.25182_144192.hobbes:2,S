Al, I don't even think about doing it :) Tar still works for me (and the
neutral format to be compatible with all fs will be nothing more than a
tar can export) and the thing is not even close to be interesting. It was
obvious though that :
# raiser.export | ext2.import && ext2.export | raiser.import
will produce a different raiser metadata.
