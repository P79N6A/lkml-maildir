a very clintonesque definition indeed ;-)
what is relevant is the latency to switch from one process to another one.
And this is what we call a context switch. It includes scheduling
decisions and all sorts of other stuff. You are comparing stack &
caller-saved register switching performance (which is just a small part of
context switching and has no standing alone) against full Linux context
switch performance (this is what i quoted), and thus you have won my
'Mindcraft benchmark of the day' award :-)
