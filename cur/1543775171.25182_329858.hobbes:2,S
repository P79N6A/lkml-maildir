Note that MacOS has the monopoly on what they ship, Linux has a
motherload of file managers and window systems and all.
What pisses me off is the fact that Gnome and friends implement
their own incompatible-with-others VFS's and automounters and
stuff.
Surely supporting this in the kernel and extending the LSB
to require this is the best step to take without infringing
anyone's freedom as such.
