Hm, however, if this is a purely cosmetic thing, let's go all the way 
and format the xfs options like the others, with indentation etc:
  config XFS_RT
-       bool "Realtime support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
+       bool "  XFS Realtime support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
May be simpler to just make this change internally & let Nathan push it 
out.  I do agree that it looks better.  :)
