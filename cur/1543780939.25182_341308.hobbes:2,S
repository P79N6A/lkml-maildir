This is broken code. You are supposed to set the state before adding
oneself to the wait-queue, if you are going to unconditionally sleep,
I believe.
So, the loop probably should be:
prepare_to_wait(&channel->wait, &wait, TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
for (;;) {
         spin_unlock_irqrestore (&chip->lock, flags);
 
         set_current_state (TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE); // redundant in the
first iteration
         schedule();
 
         spin_lock_irqsave (&chip->lock, flags);
 
         if (channel->frag_num - channel->filled_frags)
             break;
}
 
finish_wait(&channel->wait, &wait);
Thanks,
Nish
