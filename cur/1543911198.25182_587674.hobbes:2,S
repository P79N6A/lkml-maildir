Hi,
I have a problem with a 82801DB chipset, the intel-rng module refuses to
load with the following error:
intel_rng: FWH not detected
The problem is that there is almost no entropy available for
/dev/random, and so SSL operations take a loooooooong time.
I have tried to look at the intel-rng module, and added some debug code
to check for the command results:
intel_rng:   mfc: 0x00ea (should be 0x0089)
intel_rng:   dvc: 0x0045 (should be 0x00ac or 0x00ad)
intel_rng: FWH not detected
intel_rng: XXX Trying to continue anyway
intel_rng:   hw_status: 0x00 (should contain 0x40)
Then, again a -ENODEV.
Tried with 2.6.19.4 and 2.6.22.3, no result. For what I can tell, 2.6.8
had no RNG but had more entropy available.
I'm not sure the mhat a hardware RNG is present, so I want to check.
How can I know if this motherboard contains a RNG ? (which seems not to
be the case). This is a MB for servers (with a compact flash slot), and
has no soudn card, for ex.
lshw shows:
       description: Motherboard
       product: i845GV-83628HF
Alternatively, how can I make more entropy available ? (other than
tricks like using find() or similar, I do not think this is a serious
solution for a server to run "find /" in a cron every minute ..).
Maybe I have not understood, but it seems that entropy generators try to
create a new device /dev/erandom, for ex, so it would need a
modification of applications to work.
Thanks for your help,
Pierre
