It cannot be lifted without:
1) creating aliasing between buffercache and blkdev pagecache
2) changing all fs to kmap around all buffercache accesses
2 would create an huge change (sure not a good idea during 2.6, 2.7 if
something). 1 would break lilo and tunefs and other things writing to a
superblock while the fs is mounted.
I effectively wrote it like 2 but I had to learn the hard way it broke
lilo in some weird configuration and IIRC Linus and Al fixed it very
nicely with current design.
There's no highmem and in turn no limit on 64bit in the first place, so
both efforts are worthless in the long term.
