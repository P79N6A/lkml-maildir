Hi,
I am trying to build user-mode-linux binaries for sparc64 architecture.
I am running a debian (sid) system. Now, I made some sparc64 specific
changes to uml code like TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE and SPARC_FLAG_32BIT. 
When I try to "make vmlinux", I get the following error:
checksum.S:513: Fatal error: checksum.S:97: bad return from
bfd_install_relocation
I tried searching for this error, but couldn't get any help. Is there
any documentation where I can look for possible reasons for different
kinds of Sparc64 compilation errors? 
I am not subscribed to the mailing list, so please CC me. Any pointers
would be appreciated.
Thank you
-Regards
