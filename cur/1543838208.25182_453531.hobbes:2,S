Sadly, the case of using EVIOCGRAB for mice to stop the use of
/dev/input/mice is actually not the primary usage.
xf86-input-evdev will more or less happily continue talking to a mouse
that it can't grab, however things become somewhat more problematic when
it comes to keyboards.
X needs to keep the keyboard driver from receiving events while it has
it open, however that being the default behavior would be, ah,
undesirable because just running evtest on the event node of the
keyboard could abruptly make it unkillable. (Single keyboard system.)
An alternative would be to either redefine the semantics of EVIOCGRAB,
add another value to it, or another ioctl entirely, which explicitly
tells the kernel to stop listening for the console keyboard handler,
the multiplexer, etc.
I'm not horribly attached to any specific means for doing it, except
that it needs to either explicitly fail or fallback to 'X has this
keyboard, the kernel does not' if we don't support it. (Trying it on a
2.4 kernel or a current 2.6 kernel, for example.)
Quite simply, having the X server killed when someone hits ctrl-C in an
xterm is entirely unacceptable, and so we need to make sure that it
can't happen.  Beyond that, throwing support in for a less exclusive
grab is fairly trivial.
