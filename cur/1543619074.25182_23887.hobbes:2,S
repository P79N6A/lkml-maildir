Absolutely. Even something as simplistic as "lmbench file re-read" changed
by 0.1% or something. I definitely believe in the scalability part (as
long as the different processes don't all touch the same mapping all the
time), so I'm more interested in the "what is the impact of the hash chain
lookup/walk vs the radix tree walk" kinds of numbers.

Well, I would put it the other way around: the advantage of the
per-mapping lock (as opposed to the per-hashchain one) is that for common
access patterns where one process walks the whole file, we get added
locality from the per-mapping approach. While the per-hashchain one tends
to take a _lot_ of different locks (module bucket behaviour, of course).
And locality is good - especially as we try to make processes have CPU
affinity anyway. So I'd expect the per-mapping lock to generally show
_nicer_ cache behaviour.
