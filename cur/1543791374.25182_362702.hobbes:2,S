Ah, but what if the unregister function for atomic chains is implemented
in such a way that it doesn't sleep or block?  That's what Chandra and I
have been discussing.
On the other hand, it's still true that for blocking chains, unregister
will have to acquire a write semaphore.  We won't want callouts on
blocking chains (which already own the read semaphore) trying to 
unregister themselves.
And in any case, it's cleaner for callouts never to unregister themselves.  
That's why I tend to prefer the block_enable/disable solution.
