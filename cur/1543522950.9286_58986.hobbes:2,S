sorry it was a my bad explanation, we are speaking about scheduling times.
The 15% loss is relative at the same switch / second.
The fact is that two tasks enviroments has a switch rate much lower then a
300 one,
so the 15% loss must be scaled with a factor (2 / 300) << K < M, where M
depend
on the nature of the tasks ( system call rate versus pure computing ).
I think it can be lower than 1%.
Cheers,
    Davide.
