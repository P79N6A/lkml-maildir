Such programs, like Adaptec CD Creator, create a big map on a CD-RW,
because one place on CD-RW can be rewritten not more than about 15 times.
If this feature will be inserted in to kernel, the code, that handles that
map should be written. But isn't format of this map and algorithm of
working with it proprietary, closed standart? So, will developers have any
law problems with it?
Best regards.
