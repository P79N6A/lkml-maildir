	Admitedly, 256 bytes is a bit of nothing, but people trying to cram
linux into extreme small memory machines, perhaps for embedded applications
are interested in reducing any unneeded memory consumption. The linux-lite
people might have different ideas about tuning, than someone with a fat
router. Whatever the 'linux tuning' project results in, I hope at its core,
it creates _information_; what can you do, and what it means, and why.
	Once the information is gathered, you can package it up in different
ways, according to various biases.
