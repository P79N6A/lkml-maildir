I'm not sure if these memory barriers are even needed, or whether
volatile made any impact on stability - but I can isolate these 
changes today and see if it has any impact simply by experimenting.

I would prefer to just minimize the whole thing to a patch that 
only fixes the stabilty problem, less paranoidically. If you can
suggest such patch for me to test I'd be happy to give it a try.

Interesting, I'll look into that. I wonder how it managed to work 
so far.

Nothing, that's just a diff hunk I should have cleaned away.

A 256 entry SG array takes a PAGE_SIZE, I didn't want to allocate more
than PAGE_SIZE to avoid fragmentation problems.

Yes, I forgot these allocations should be aligned (by 16, right?).

Me too.
