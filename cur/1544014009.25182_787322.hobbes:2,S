I didn't see that documented anywhere, so my patch adds a comment to
that effect.

I'm no kernel locking or scheduling (or anything else) expert, but if
printk can check to see if xtime_lock is held, can it skip trying to
wake klogd (so messages still get logged, just maybe not quite as fast)?
Is there anything else that will wake klogd later?
