After some testing, I found that the pmac_zilog Oops (which claims we've
not initialized port->lock) only occurs when I also enable 8250/16550
serial support (CONFIG_SERIAL_8250)
I'll try to track down what's going on on the plane tomorrow, but I'm 
curious to hear if any of the recent csets might have caused this...

Sure enough, the "IN from bad port XXXXXXXX" ended up being the i8042
serial PC keyboard driver, enabled with CONFIG_SERIO_I8042.  Don't know
why that's in ppc defconfig....
