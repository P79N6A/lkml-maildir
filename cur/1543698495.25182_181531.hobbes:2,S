I'm totally confused.
What's a miniport driver?  What is a boot controller?  Do these have
anything to do with LBA?
Also, you say "autodetect"... you mean it is making a decision to use
some method (not that I understand this).  How does it make the decision?
The article doesn't mention "Linear", "LBA", "boot controller" or
"miniport driver" at all.  (I was looking at
http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=98080
 - is this the right one?)
The question I believe I asked was: how does the Windows installation
software decide whether to use LBA or CHS?  Is this an answer to
this question?
Cheers,
Andrew
