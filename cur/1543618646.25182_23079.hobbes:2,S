Btw, a little story about startup times and Linux.
I once wrote a Perl script that needed to know the current directory.
It did:
   use POSIX 'getcwd'
   getcwd(...)
After a few months, I was annoyed by the slowness of this script
(compared with other scripts) and decided to try speeding it up.  It
turns out that the above two lines took about 0.25 of a second, and that
was the dominant running time of the script.
I replaced getcwd() with `/bin/pwd`.  Lo!  It took about 0.0075 second.
Says very good things about Linux' fork, exec and mmap times, and about
Glibc's dynamic loading time, I think.
