Every 2 seconds exactly.
I would also be interested in a statement from intel fellows on the 
reasoning behind this decision, since every user of gkrellm will 
notice some strange behaviour (value oscillating between 0 and 
throughput * 2). (Poor man's real time bandwidth management ;-). 
After being tired of cognitive interpretation of these values, I 
decided to fix it, which was pretty easy:
