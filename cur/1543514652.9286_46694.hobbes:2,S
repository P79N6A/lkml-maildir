Hi,
2.2.x caches NFS accesses.  I have a LED on the wall that indicates
that I have mail. When I see it on, I want to read my Email. Is there
a way that I can foce a cache invalidate? It is now annoying to have
to wait something like 30 seconds before I can read Email that I know
is simply sitting in my mailbox... 
					Roger.
