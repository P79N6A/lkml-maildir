I tried this patch + 2.2.10 + patches from knfsd 1.4.6. It works just
fine for me. However, I did see the "Stale NFS file handle" problem.
My conclusions are
1. NFS client in 2.2.10 is broken.
2. Both NFS server and client in 2.2.10-ac10 are broken.
I will take a look at #1 and I will leave #2 to others.
