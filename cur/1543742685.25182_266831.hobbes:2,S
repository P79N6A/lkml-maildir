iirc gcc itself was faster (the modern one,  not the old version in SpecInt) 
KDE startup ended up being faster too, but that may have been due to other
improvements too.
This was all tested on CPUs with very large caches (1MB L2), you
can pack a lot of code into that.
Also when people benchmark -m64 code compared to -m32 they often
see large improvements on AMD64 (as long as the code isn't long or pointer
memory bound), and I suspect at least part of that can be explained
by the -m64 gcc defaulting to the long function prologues.
Another example of larger code usually being better is x87 vs SSE2 floating
point math.

in SpecInt.

I would expect it to help in the uncached case too because
the CPU does very aggressive prefetching of code. Once 
it gets started on a function it will fetch it very quickly.

Yes, there are. And there are others that don't.
