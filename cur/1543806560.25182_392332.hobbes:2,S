At the risk of the obvious....
 	struct meminfo meminfo;
         ioctl(fd, UPDATE_PARAMS, &meminfo);
... and define UPDATE_PARAMS and other function codes to start
above those normally used by kernel stuff so that `strace` doesn't
make up stories.
This is what the ioctl() interface is for. Inside the kernel
you can use spinlocks (after you got the data from user-space)
to make the operations atomicc.
