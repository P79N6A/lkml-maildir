You just described the "dentry" reference counting. Which has the same 
issues: as long as a dentry has any children, it needs to remain.
Except dentries are a lot more complex, because we want to keep cached 
versions of them around even when the count goes to zero (and zero only 
means that we're _allowed_ to remove it under memory pressure). And 
dentries can move from one parent to another.
