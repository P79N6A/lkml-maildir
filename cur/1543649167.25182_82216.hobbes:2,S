After struggling with setting up LSB to test
remote mounts for a while, I checked
with the LSB team on Andi's suggestion below of
using the POSIX file API section of LSB on a
network mount.   They indicated that it won't
work without modifications to the LSB source,
(I had been trying to do it via just changing
the config files) something I will eventually
have to look into.
