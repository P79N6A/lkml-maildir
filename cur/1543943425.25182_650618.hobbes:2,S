There was a good analysis of that argument on the list some time ago. I
think the conclusion was fairly definitively no as the GPL explicitly
gives the right to modify GPL code. You are therefore aready "authorised"
to make such a change.
It might have a significance in terms of intent but thats for lawyers to
argue over.
