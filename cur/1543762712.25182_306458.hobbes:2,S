<flame type="Binary Driver Hatred">
NOTE: I *strongly* discourage binary drivers.  They're crap and 
frustrate
poor PowerPC users like me.  Since this is purely a theoretical 
discussion,

THE BELOW MAY NOT BE USED IN A BINARY DRIVER, SO DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT 
IT!
</flame>
Ok, so what if the _driver_ provides an API like this:
int start_driver(void);
int stop_driver(void);
void register_alloc(void *(*alloc)(unsigned long));
void register_free(void (*free)(void *));
[... more register functions here, generic functionality ...]
And a BSD licensed bit of glue based on that interface that connects the
driver to a dozen different OSen by wrapping or using their interfaces
directly.
Do you think _that's_ legal?  As far as I can see, even that level is
iffy, but it's a murky issue, and I doubt it will be decided one way or
another until people test it in various courts.
Cheers,
