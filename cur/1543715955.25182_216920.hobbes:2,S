Yes, and the two other functions doing similar stuff.

Yes pagevec are much more efficient for that.  In fact I have a workarea
switching over XFS to use pagevec for that probing.
I'm not yet sure where I'm heading with revamping xfs_aops.c, but what
I'd love to see in the end is more or less xfs implementing only
writepages and some generic implement writepage as writepages wrapper.
