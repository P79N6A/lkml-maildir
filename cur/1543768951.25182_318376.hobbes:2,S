Subject: [2.6.12-rc4] Oops in reiserfs_panic [please CC]

Hi list,
I have tried to compile 2.6.12-rc4 on my iBook G4 running Debian Sid, 
with custom 2.6.9 kernel.
2.6.9 works absolutely wonderful on this machine, so I used the same 
.config file to compile 2.6.12-rc4, downloaded as a complete tarball.
Upon rebooting with the new kernel, my reiserfs partition (/ actually) 
is correctly seen and checked, but then (before syslogd starts) I get an 
Oops. I transcribe here the first lines:
REISERFS: panic
Kernel BUG in reiserfs_panic at fs/reiserfs/panic.c:362!
Oops: Exception in kernel mode, sig:5 [#1]
If you need any other info I will be glad to report them. Thanks for any 
help.
