    Yes, probably. If the SDDR-09 lets you talk to the raw flash rather than 
    doing the SmartMedia format for you in hardware/firmware then that support
    probably also wants to be separated so it can be used on any hardware. 
Maybe you can look at ftp.XX.kernel.org people/aeb/*sddr09*.
I used identifiers nand_* when I thought things would be useful
for both (so that they should be outside of the usb tree).
Maybe we can find a suitable setup.
No, I am afraid this thing doesn't let me talk to raw flash,
or if it does, I have not yet discovered how.
