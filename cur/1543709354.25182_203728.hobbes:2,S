Looks good to me, but Dave is more familiar with this stuff ... Dave?

Bill has been keeping that up to date  - he may have some more recent
changes somewhere?

John has that going - there's a copy in 2.6.3-mjb1, but it has a problem
at the moment on some boxes, which he's trying to fix up. I've been 
pushing for the same thing - fixing the most common syscall will help ;-)
We're trying to get some numbers here, but have had a small setback with
some disk problems - should be this week still though.

Makes sense. But why would you want 4:4 on opteron? I'm not sure we care
about the perf for anyone nutty enough to run a 32 bit kernel there ;-)
