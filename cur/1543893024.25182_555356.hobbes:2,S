I tried to give each file it's own label, but I couldn't do it.

There are many elements that forms too strong barrier between pathname and labels,
such as bind-mounts, hard links, newly created files, renamed files, temporary files and so on.
So I gave up giving each file a label that can be used as an identifier,
and took an approach to forbid unneeded mount operations, unneeded link operations,
unneeded renaming operations to keep the pathname represent it's own identifier as much as possible.
Thanks.
