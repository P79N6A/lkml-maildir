Are there any pointers on fixing up kernel code that likes to blow up with the
newer EGCS semantics (spillage/etc)? I realize that GCC 2.7.2 is supposed to be
the supported compiler but its days are very numbered.
I'm mainly wanting to fixup the Pentium FPU memcpy for egcs because my uber-old
P60 eats it up like no tomorrow when enabled.
