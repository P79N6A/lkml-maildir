Hi,
As part of my thesis I've written an extended ptrace i386 syscall patch.
This patch makes it possible to trace the memory writes made by 
system calls in a very easy way. If anyone else is looking for such a 
thing, I've put it online.
Since it's my first 'big' kernel patch feedback would be very appriciated.
The address,
