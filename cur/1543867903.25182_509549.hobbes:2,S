The problem here is that due to historical reasons, there could be code
out there that abuses "char" for "signed char" (not sure about "unsigned
char"). Old code and old habits are rather persistent.

How are you sure those who wrote foo(char*) agrees with your opinion or
even understands all the involved issues?

And if people were writing perfect portable code all the time, there
would be no need for warnings in the first place...
