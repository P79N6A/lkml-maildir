Thinking more on this and looking for possible solutions:  One  
(voluntary) technical solution to a mildly technical problem of lack  
of authenticity would be to write a mail server (or just glue postfix  
and apache with some perl CGIs) which stored the emails locally and  
added a header like this:
> X-Hosted-Email:  
http://my.mail.server/hosted-email?id=
$BASE64_HASH
Then replace the body with this:
> You have received a hosted email from "John Doe"  
> <jdoe@mail.server>.  Click the link below to view the email, or  
> install a free hosted-email client from http:// 
> oss.hosted.email.project/
>
> 
http://my.mail.server/hosted-email?id=
$BASE64_HASH
The templated message might start to get filtered by a few spam- 
filters, but it makes blacklisting of abusers much easier so such  
messages could easily be given a big +bonus in spamassassin or  
similar.  If each compliant server along the way checked that the  
host server was up and provided a compliant SMTP-over-HTTP email it  
would be a trivial load for individual hosts but a quite considerable  
load for spammers.  In addition it's possible to implement other  
checks like wait-for-http-response-before-accepting-email, content  
filters, digital signatures, and other processing steps.  Such a  
system would be very reliable and easy to implement by relying on  
existing proven technologies (SMTP and HTTP) in completely standards- 
compliant ways.  Just some food for thought.
Cheers,
