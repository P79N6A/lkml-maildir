I think the point James is making is that on very large systems, you
will get system tick skew as well. On one system I know of, the bus
frequency is intensionally skewed slightly between nodes. This is what
causes the TSCs to skew, and I believe would also cause this "system
tick" to skew as well.
Additionally, where is this system tick thing? You make it sound like
its a register in the cpu, and while the Ultra-III may have one, I'm
unaware of a system/bus tick register on intel chips. Is it in some
semi-documented MSR?
I apologize for being confused, I'm just not sure if your criticizing
the code or the hardware. 
thanks
