We have to do a similar thing for some zd1211rw USB-wireless devices, 
which appear as a virtual CDROM drive on plugin. To convert them to a 
proper wireless device, the cdrom has to be ejected, then the device 
disconnects and reconnects with different ID's (and the wireless endpoints).
Originally I wrote a usb-storage subdriver to handle the auto-eject, but 
this was rejected. It was decided to make usb-storage simply ignore the 
devices, and have the zd1211rw driver do the eject operation. The same 
may also apply in your case. See the US_FL_IGNORE_DEVICE flag, and the 
DEVICE_INSTALLER handling in drivers/net/wireless/zd1211rw/zd_usb.c
