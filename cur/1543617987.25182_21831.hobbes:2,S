True. But unfortunately that's not a useful guarantee. This code doesn't
(normally) run _on_ Linux. It is _in_ Linux, and it's still possible that
the offending code won't get included when it should.

We think *BSD uses _KERNEL, and don't know of anything else which defines 
__KERNEL__ other than Linux. So he's switching from something that's known 
broken to something which we _believe_ will be reliable.
