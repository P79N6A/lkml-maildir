The bug of nr_hashed_buffers inconsistency is due where
nr_hashed_buffers++ nr_hashed_buffers-- are been placed by me. They has to
be placed in the path where pprev is != 0. It's really a minor issue
though.
        struct buffer_head **pprev = bh->b_pprev;
        if (pprev) {
                struct buffer_head * next = bh->b_next;
                if (next) {
                        next->b_pprev = pprev;
                        bh->b_next = NULL;
                }
                *pprev = next;
                bh->b_pprev = NULL;
                nr_hashed_buffers--;
        }
and where b_dev is != 0:
        if (bh->b_dev) {
                struct buffer_head **bhp = &hash(bh->b_dev, bh->b_blocknr);
                struct buffer_head *next = *bhp;
                if (next) {
                        bh->b_next = next;
                        next->b_pprev = &bh->b_next;
                }
                *bhp = bh;
                bh->b_pprev = bhp;
                nr_hashed_buffers++;
        }
