That's is route.c and regards the route cache. It received a
RTCF_REDIRECTED, I don't know if this is arp or ICMP related, but occurs
very often if you have a NAS and the client which was connected to your
server was disconnected from the NAS.
In any case, the client is not accessible from your machine.
BTW, I suppose this printk is quite annoying (or ar least disc
consuming) for ISPs, but it's easy to avoid it, just comment line 717 in
linux/net/ipv4/route.c
Best regards,
