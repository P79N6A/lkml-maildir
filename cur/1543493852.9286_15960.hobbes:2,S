You need to beg Rockwell for the specs for the modem and write a
driver.

I'm sorry to say that you are out of luck for now. Generally Linux
only works with internal modems which have a serial port onboard. The
new PCI modems are not real modems as they compleately lack serial
functionality (which is done by software). Hence support in the
kernel is needed for these to work. Go buy an external modem.
