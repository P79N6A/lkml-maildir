Subject: System hang with ATI's lousy driver

So, since XFree86's lousy open-source Radeon driver won't do OpenGL 
right, I am forced to use ATI's lousy proprietary Radeon driver.  With 
that, I can do OpenGL right, but when I exit the X server, the system 
hangs completely.  I get lots of vertical lines on the screen, but I 
can't even ping the computer.
Does anyone know of any conflict between using ATI's X11 driver and the 
Radeon console driver at the same time?
I'm using kernel gentoo-2.4.25.
I'm getting really sick of not being able to get new graphics cards to 
just work properly under Linux.
Thanks.
