Subject: TCP stack optimization for high number of connections [OT]

I'm running a front end spam filtering service and I
get a lot of incoming connections but not a lot of
volume of traffic. I'm experiencing some high loads
and I think it might be related to the volume of
connections it's processing. I often will be connected
to 2500 email servers at once and a lot more that are
trying to connect and being denied.
My question - are there any optimizations I can do to
make the TCP faster for high number of short lived
connections?
Also - how much do iptable entries slow things down
and is there any optimizations for that?
