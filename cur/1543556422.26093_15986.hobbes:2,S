    Definately could be your hardware.  I once saw a 486 board (PcChips M571
I think) which would report a PS/2 mouse even though the port didn't even
exist on the motherboard.  This problem showed up on all versions of Win9x.
From what I could tell it appeared as if the BIOS had support for the PS/2
mouse port but the port pins themself had not been saudered onto the board
and for some reason the board alway thaught it had a PS/2 mouse and reported
as so to Windows.
