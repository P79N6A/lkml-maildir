Don't know but the following might be used as a work-around:
Set up a perl script to search for the ports used by the "LAST_ACK".
Use this information to find the processes that hold these open, and
use fuser -k to kill them.
I used to have a news server that exhibited the same type of problem.
My script limited the number of outstanding closes to 20-50. I sorted
the list by port order, and killed all but the last 20. This kept the
server up, and available. I think the web server will respawn processes
as needed, but the leftover ones will be terminated and release the
resources.
It is a problem, but I don't know where, unless a timeout is set too
large in the TCP/IP stack.
