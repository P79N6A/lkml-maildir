Wow, I did not know.

Because all locking goes through timer_list->base->lock now.
That is why timer_list->lock can be deleted. The timer is
always locked via loc_timer_base().
timer->base == NULL only temporally when __mod_timer() does
while switching timer's base:
	base = lock_timer_base(timer);
	timer->base = NULL;
	unlock(base->lock);
		// Nobody can use this timer, lock_timer_base()
		// will spin waiting for ->base != 0
	lock(new_base->lock);
	timer->base = new_base;
	unlock(new_base);
So ->base == NULL means that timer itself is locked, not it's
base. That is why __mod_timer() do not need to hold 2 spinlocks
at once.
Oleg.
