I tried this tree a while ago but at the time it had a problem with tags 
(
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/14/177
). I just recloned and see that's now 
fixed...
I'm rolling my own since then though. Not sure, but perhaps it's interesting 
to someone: when Linus tags a release from his repo I branch of the -stable 
branch myself:
$ git checkout -b v22 v2.6.22
and then (following advice from Junio Hamano) add the following stanza to 
.git/config:
===
[branch "v22"]
         remote = linux-2.6.22.y
         merge = refs/heads/master
[remote "linux-2.6.22.y"]
         url = 
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.22.y.git
         fetch = refs/heads/master
===
(the url = is one line, but is wrapping).
When on this v22 branch, a simple "git pull" then updates from the stable 
tree. It's been working nicely for me. The manual .git/config editing is a 
little awkard perhaps but for all I know I could do so via some well-chosen 
git commands.
Rene.
