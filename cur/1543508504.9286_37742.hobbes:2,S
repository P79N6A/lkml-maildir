    Thanks a lot, it works in part, but unfortunately there's
something I can't explain:
 I set up a notifier to watch my eth0, the body of the
notifier is a big switch() that prints different messages
(depending on the delivered notification)
 I can see ifconfig eth0 up/down nicely, but ifconfig IP
does not do anything.
 I can see clearly  (in ./net/core/dev.c) that the code is
indended to be called, but it just never happens.
 Did anyone else see it?
 Any pointers are welcome.
 Thanks.
 Roman
P.S.
 I wonder if I can get the address of the ipv4_table (defined in
sysctl_net_ipv4.c)
from the kernel module. I want to toggle ip forwarding on/off
so that this will display in /proc/sys/net/ip_forwarding.
