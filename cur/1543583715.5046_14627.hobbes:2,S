Yes - gather this can make life in the fast lane easier... if its all done 
perfectly.
Just wanted to confirm that the freezes _do_ happen with X3.3.6 too.  I was 
able to get into kdb from a serial console (an then lost the log - murphy can 
be a real PITA).   I figure a ps, bt and bta should be enough to point out 
the problem task?  Its there anything else I should do (sr t maybe?)?
This was with 2.4.2+ac10+kdb1.8 and x3.3.6 it froze when I returned to the 
keyboard after a pause of three hours.
TIA,
Ed
