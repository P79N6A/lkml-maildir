It is broken subtly (but noone would probably notice :-)).  It is OK
on the structure size, but copy_siginfo will copy sizeof(int) bytes less
than necessary sometimes (particularly in the case of a SIGCHILD).
You need the following patch (against 2.6.0-test1-bk2 but should apply
to just about anything).
