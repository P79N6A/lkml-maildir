This is a good step in the right direction for ARM, but not quite there 
yet.
As it is, the core mutex code is still relying on atomic 
decrement/increment to work properly.  What would be extremely 
beneficial on ARM is to be able to use (variants of) atomic_xchg 
everywhere.  And the semantics of a mutex allows that where a semaphore 
doesn't (which is why I see big benefits for ARM with mutexes).
I even forsee a fast path implementation on ARMv6 that would use an 
hybrid approach which will be less instructions and cycles than a 
standard atomic decrement/increment (they are available only on ARM 
version 6 and above).
What we'd need is a bit more  flexibility but only at the low level.  No 
need to reimplement the whole of mutex_lock(), mutex_unlock(), and 
friends.
Please consider the 3 following patches that already bring an immediate 
benefit on ARM, even if the fast path isn't inlined yet.
