I tested the new version from today... it works okay. It produces some
weird messages:
acpiphp: Slot [4294967295] registered
ACPI Exception (acpi_bus-0072): AE_NOT_FOUND, No context for object
[c1d081e8] [20060210]
PCI: Found IBM Dock II Cardbus Bridge applying quirk
PCI: Found IBM Dock II Cardbus Bridge applying quirk
PCI: Transparent bridge - 0000:02:03.0
PCI: Bus #0c (-#0f) is hidden behind transparent bridge #02 (-#0b)
Please report the result to linux-kernel to fix this permanently
PCI: Bus #10 (-#13) is hidden behind transparent bridge #02 (-#0b)
Please report the result to linux-kernel to fix this permanently
ACPI Exception (acpi_bus-0072): AE_NOT_FOUND, No context for object
[c1d02368] [20060210]
Could the code be fixed not to start numbering slots from -1?
