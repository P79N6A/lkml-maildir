  Weird claims are made all the time...
  I don't know, how  linux.*  groups are working, and (more importantly)
  is there a feed from  linux-kernel (et.al.) LISTS to that/those
  newsgroup(s).
  Because BIDIRECTIONAL list/newsgroup interconnect is extremely difficult
  to do (and keep working) so that there won't happen any sort of loops,
  we are actively discouraging such things.
  (Do it, blunder, and your feed is killed.)
  For UNIDIRECTIONAL  list->newsgroup  feed we listkeepers won't care
  (much), except perhaps dislike of address harvesters sending spams..
  I don't now remember what was the motivation for forbidding UNIDIRECTIONAL
  (local) newsfeed, unless it was to cut down the number of "That is nice
  rule for average John Doe, but I am a Wizard at this.." blunderers..
  (Which were abundant a year or two ago.)
