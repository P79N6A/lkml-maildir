This is (at least on the PC) a userspace issue.
As a previous poster pointed out, you can already do this by specifying 
LABEL=Home              /home                   ext2    defaults     1 2
or 
UUID=<whatever it is>	/home 			ext2 	defaults     1 2
in fstab. I tried it, and mount likes the labels just fine. However, my
fsck doesn't understand the labels yet (didn't try the UUIDs). 
Is there a new fsck that will look at ext2 labels like mount does?
I suppose mount/fsck could be taught to look at the label in the RDB if
you have an Amiga.

On my Amiga, when I was partitioning a new drive, it asked me for a name, 
so I gave it MOE:, which was an easier name to remember than DH3:
