Headers serve a technical purpose.  So for example adding Received: headers
is a MUST according to RFC 2822, 3.8.2:
3.8.2 Received Lines in Gatewaying
   When forwarding a message into or out of the Internet environment, a
   gateway MUST prepend a Received: line, but it MUST NOT alter in any
   way a Received: line that is already in the header.
Similar for the other headers; basically all of them cannot be removed
without loosing functionality or putting the reliability of the mail
system at stake.  Let me just say mail loops ...
