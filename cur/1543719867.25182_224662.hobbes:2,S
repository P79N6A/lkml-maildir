Depends on the type of crash: updates are sequenced and synced (in
co-ordinated batches) so it should cope with events like
freezing/stopping (but not necessarily memory corruption).
As Kevin indicated, we'll certainly be generating more documentation
in the near future.  [Some of this will be a by-product of the
forthcoming LVM2/device-mapper tutorial at LinuxTag.]
