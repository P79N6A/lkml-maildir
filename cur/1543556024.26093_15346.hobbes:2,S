The funny thing being, access() _was_ consistent with open(). Relevant code
(I doubt that AT&T will care):
/*
 * open system call
 */
open()
{
        register struct inode *ip;
        register struct a {
                char    *fname;
                int     rwmode;
        } *uap;
        uap = (struct a *)u.u_ap;
        ip = namei(uchar, 0);
        if(ip == NULL)
                return;
        open1(ip, ++uap->rwmode, 0);
}
open1(ip, mode, trf)
register struct inode *ip;
register mode;
{
        register struct file *fp;
        int i;
        if(trf != 2) {
                if(mode&FREAD)
                        access(ip, IREAD);
                if(mode&FWRITE) {
                        access(ip, IWRITE);
                        if((ip->i_mode&IFMT) == IFDIR)
                                u.u_error = EISDIR;
                }
        }
        if(u.u_error)
                goto out;
....
out:
        iput(ip);
}
access(ip, mode)
register struct inode *ip;
{
        register m;
        m = mode;
        if(m == IWRITE) {
                if(getfs(ip->i_dev)->s_ronly != 0) {
                        u.u_error = EROFS;
                        return(1);
                }
....
}
See what happens? open() calls open1(ip, mode, 0), we check that rtf is
not 2 and call access(ip, mode). Which sets u.u_error to EROFS and we
return from open1() (and open()). Failing. So behaviour of access()
was pretty and consistent with open().
When opening devices for write became allowed even for r/o filesystems
access() also had to be changed. And changed it was, back in mid-80s.
It's way older than Linux. Changing one of them and leaving another
as-is means introducing a bug. If standard admits one but not another -
standard is buggy. Again, when 4.*BSD (and 2.*BSD) allowed opening devices
for write even for nodes on r/o filesystems they did change access().
If standard in question doesn't allow such use of open() - too fscking bad.
For standard. Because I'll take the ability to boot from r/o media and
install the system (kinda requires ability to run mkfs) over POSIX/SuS
compliance any day.
<looking into SuS> Oh, lovely...
   [EROFS]
          The named file resides on a read-only file system and either
          O_WRONLY, O_RDWR, O_CREAT (if file does not exist) or O_TRUNC
          is set in the oflag argument.
Wonderful. Andries, care to try pushing _that_ kind of standard-compliance?
It _is_ consistent, all right. And utterly wrong.
