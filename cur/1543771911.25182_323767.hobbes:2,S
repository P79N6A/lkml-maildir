The howto deal with an IOMMU has been sorted out but so far no one 
has actually done it.  What has been discussed previously is simply
reserving a handful of IOMMU entries, and then only using those
in the crash recover kernel.  This is essentially what we do with DMA
on architectures that don't have an IOMMU and it seems quite safe
enough there.

Well we are at least capable of multitasking but that is no longer the
primary focus.  Having polling as at least an option should make
debugging easier.  Last I looked Andrews kernel hand an irqpoll option
to do something very like this.

Agreed.  Which means any drivers we really need for dumping the system
should be fine.  If the drivers don't work in that mode at least the
concept of fixing it won't be controversial.
