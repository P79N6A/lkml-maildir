Hello everybody!
I'm just playing around with netlink and all the interesting event
devices in 2.6.23.9, because I see that acpid still uses
/proc/acpi/event.
And I must say that the whole event system is pretty fun:
Easy to use, mostly documentated in linux/input.h and
helpful ioctl()s.
I did some hacking on it and if somebody wants to see his / her
acpi events without /proc/acpi/event, she / he can try some of the hacks
under

Many greetings,
Nico

P.P.S.: If I see how easy it is, I really think of spending some time on
        gpm again, to resurrect it and the work on gpm2...
