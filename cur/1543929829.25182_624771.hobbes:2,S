Subject: [patch 0/7] Immediate Values (redux) for 2.6.24-rc4-git3

Hi,
Here are the redux version of immediate values. It currently supports x86_32,
x86_64 and powerpc. The other architectures use a generic fallback (a simple
variable).
It depends on the text edit lock patches. It diminishes the impact of dormant
markers by providing a fast branch over a function call with a "load immediate"
instruction. It minimizes the d-cache hit.
This redux version it not reentrant wrt NMIs and MCEs. One must be cautious not
to use it in code paths reached by such execution contexts.
It could be interesting to queue this for 2.6.25.
Mathieu
