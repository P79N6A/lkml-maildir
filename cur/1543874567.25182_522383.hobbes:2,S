I'm tied up elsewhere so I won't get to it in a timely fashion. Maybe
in a few weeks I can start up on the first two of the bunch.

Not much of a VM translation; it's just a lookup through the software
mocked-up structures on everything save i386, x86_64, and some m68k where
they're the same thing only with hardware walkers (ISTR ia64's being
firmware a la Alpha despite the "HPW" name, though I could be wrong)
reliant on them. The drivers/etc. could just as easily use helper
functions to carry out the lookup, thereby accomplishing the
unification. There's nothing particularly fundamental about a pte
lookup. Normal arches that do software TLB refill could just as easily
consult the radix trees dangled off struct address_space or any old
data structure floating around the kernel with enough information to
translate user virtual addresses to the physical addresses they need to
fill the TLB with, and there are other kernels that literally do things
like that.
Basically, drop in to the ->fault() callback with no attempt at a pte
lookup. The drivers using the standard pagetable format can call helper
functions to do all the gruntwork surrounding that for them. Then the
more sophisticated drivers can do the necessary work by hand.
But others should really be consulted on this point. My notions in/around
this area tend to be outside the mainstream. I can anticipate that the
two ->fault() functions will look strange to people, but not what
alternatives would be most idiomatic to mainstream Linux conventions.
