I read the list archive yesterday, and tried this work. I got the results
http://youpibouh.thefreecat.org/speedstep/ac
http://youpibouh.thefreecat.org/speedstep/battery
and hence tried my gpo_hilo=11, and it works... Sometimes.
I seems like the hardware si sometimes slow to get to the low speed. My
PIII is a 800Mhz/650Mhz, but initialization sometimes shows 800 and 800,
as if the speed measure was done before the hardware actually achieved
the slow down.
As a result, speedstep_cpu_init() fails, hence cpufreq_add_dev() fails,
which is ignored by sysdev_driver_register(). In the end, the module is
kept loaded (since speedstep_init() successes, since
cpufreq_register_driver successes()), and I have to unload it by hand,
which entails kobject badness warning of course, since cpufreq then
tries to remove entries which were actually never added to /sys!
I hence modified drivers/base/sys.c to have sysdev_driver_register()
fail as well, and then I also had to modify kernel/cpufreq.c, because
this failure did not imply a setting cpufreq_driver to NULL (preventing
me from reinsmoding speedstep-ich: EBUSY)
I'd also suggest that the speedstep drivers printks something if
everything went ok (including the cpufreq_frequency_table_cpuinfo()
call), the low & high speed for instance, just to be sure everything
went ok
Regards,
Samuel Thibault
