I can no longer select my soundcard: In test5 it was configured by
CONFIG_SND_CS46XX! This option is no longer available in test6 (make
menuconfig does not offer me the opportunity).
It happened between test5-bk11 (option set/module build) and bk13
(option not available).
Please, give my sound option back!
