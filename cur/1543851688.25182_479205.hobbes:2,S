sorry,  i thought i could rmmod evey module which was insmod/modprobe'd 
before and i didn`t know that there are exceptions

i think this is not completely related to vmware - but maybe this is being 
triggered more often by vmware ?
http://www.google.de/search?hl=de&q=
%22unregister_netdevice%3A+waiting+for+eth0+to+become+free
it`s really strange, but after taking a look,  vmware seems to recommend 
disabling ipv6 for _every_ linux based guest OS in general:
http://pubs.vmware.com/guestnotes/wwhelp/wwhimpl/common/html/wwhelp.htm?context=gos_ww5_output&file=choose_install_guest_os.html
since there are already running millions of  linux based VMs in this world, 
i think this isn`t very good "promotion" for ipv6, if vmware recommending 
disabling it.
ok, there are not that much people already needing ipv6 NOW, but the later 
they are running it and the later outstanding bugs being fixed, the harder 
it will be to convert from ipv4 to ipv6....
