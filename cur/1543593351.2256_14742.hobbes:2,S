Steve:
I still have not figured out the magic that creates the .ver files which
would resolve your concern with the symbol versions, but I do know that
you can edit the .ver file yourself (under /usr/src/linux/include/modules/)
and add entries.  This will eliminate the funny versioning, as in:
    grab_timer_interrupt_R__ver_grab_timer_interrupt
You can pick a hash value to use.  For example, you might add the following:
	#define __ver_grab_timer_interrupt	a1b2c3d4
	#define grab_timer_interrupt	_set_ver(grab_timer_interrupt)
As far as the printk() warning, you need to make sure your module code
includes the right header files.  In this case, I believe you need to grab
<linux/kernel.h> after including <linux/module.h>.
I hope this helps.
