Hi,
	I recently installed an RH6.0 with 2.2.12 on it and after 2 days
uptime I have 894 sockets connections from about 5-10 machines, all stuck
in CLOSE state, the machine is an ftp site and the ftp logs show these
machines were ftp connections, 
So has anyone else seen this with 2.2.12, and how do I get rid of these
sockets without rebooting the machine ..
Regards,
	Dave.
