Hello again!
Finally had time to test this on IDE, "better late than even later"...

The "max-readahead" does not seem to affect IDE-RAID, at least not with
the 2.4.27-pre6 I just compiled on two machines. So the problem still
exists, read speed on 2.4.20-ac2 is almost twice as fast as on later
kernels :-/
Have a nice summer,
