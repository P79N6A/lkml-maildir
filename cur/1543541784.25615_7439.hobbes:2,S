If by all-NT systems you mean clients which *never* run *any* program that  
*ever* wants to do anything with short filenames, you may be right.
Sadly, I don't think systems like that exist except in theory. I've  
certainly never seen any. And I don't expect that to change in the next  
ten years.
On the contrary, I see far too many programs running on NT that just can't  
deal with long filenames.

Sure. That's what it does in ext2, after all; and I know from personal  
experience that it mostly works. Programs that need short names for long- 
named objects and then save those names will get into trouble, though.
