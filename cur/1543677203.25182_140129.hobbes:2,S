David, arch-specific code in the driver concerns me.  I would really
like to avoid any arch-specific code in the driver if at all possible.
Can we find a way to move this work to the arch-dependent areas?  This
doesn't seem to be an issue unique to e1000, so moving this up one level
should benefit other devices as well.  More questions below.

2-byte alignment is bad for ppc64, so what is minimum alignment that is
good?  (I hope it's not 2K!)  What could you do at a higher level to
present properly aligned buffers to the driver?

If I'm understanding the patch correctly, you're saying unaligned DMA +
TCE lookup is more expensive than a data copy?  If we copy the data, we
loss some of the benefits of TSO and Zerocopy and h/w checksum
offloading!  What is more expensive, unaligned DMA or TCE?
