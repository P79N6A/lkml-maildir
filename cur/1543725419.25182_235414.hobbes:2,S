Nice patches, I've applied them with a few tweaks, as noted below.

Consistancy with other "get" and "put" functions.  It's quite common to
do:
	have_this_foo(foo_get(foo));
or:
	foo_to_send_off = foo_get(foo);

Heh, yeah, that's just dumb, as that failure will never happen :)

This is not needed.  First off, the Copyright statement for IBM is
already included in this file, for this same year, above these lines.
Also, we are not including file history in the files themselves, that's
what Changelog comments are for (which scale much better over time.)

The extra blank line in tha comment was needed for docbook to work
properly, last time I checked.

I also added a check here to test if release == kfree to catch people
like the s390 developers who want to do nasty hacks :)
