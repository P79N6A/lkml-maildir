I think it is perfectly within their rights to do so.  I think it's
kind of silly to try to hide it, if someone wants to boost the maximum
transmit power, they're going to hack the firmware anyway.  But if it
makes Intel happy, well... :-)

I've been hoping that they will understand that too.  So far it has
been a futile hope.  It is soo fun to write a design spec saying
"Whatever you do, do not use this chip, it sucks.  Yes, I know it is 50
cents cheaper than the competition, but it is not worth it." just too
see exactly that chip being put into the product.

Mmm.  I've actually put consulting on the shelf for a while and have
become employed by CSR instead.  They have a really nice, and as far as
I've understood, fairly good and price competitive WIFI chip for low
power systems such as mobile phones or PDAs.  I've gotten a
preliminary go ahead from the bosses to provide documentation under an
NDA to Linux developers that would like to write GPL drivers for it.  I
just haven't had time to do anything more about it yet.  And since I'm
fairly new to CSR and are located at a remote office, it takes time to
find the right people to talk to.

How could you guess?  :-)  Actually, I got three of them, and all of
them lie unused in a box at work.
And the OpenMoko sucks.  Or actually, it doesn't suck at all, I'm
thinking of buying one just for fun, it's just that I like buttons on
a phone, and really don't want a touch screen.  So I like the OpenMoko
project in every way, it's just not the right phone for me.
