Here is the most important part (limiting the disk capacity to 137GB if
LBA48 is not available) as a patch agains 2.4.21. The goto is not nice,
but I didn't want to do a major rewrite. 
Note that the function contains a bogous if-clause:
	if (id->cfs_enable_2 & 0x0400) {
	[...]
		return;
	} 
	[...]
	if ((id->command_set_2 & 0x0400) && (id->cfs_enable_2 & 0x0400)) {
	[...]
The second if-condition can never be true. But I didn't want to touch
that stuff.
