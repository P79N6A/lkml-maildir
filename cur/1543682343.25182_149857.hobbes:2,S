Hi,
I've tried to build the 2.6.0-test1 kernel and run it.
It suceeded to compile and boot properly except the isdn4linux subsystem
and the hisax driver which don't get compiled/linked properly.
I've sent a bug report to this list 3 days ago, and also CC-ed to the ISDN 
maintainers and mailing list but none have replied so far.
(it can be found here:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0307.2/0230.html
)
There are some entries in the BugZilla database about this which can be
found here:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=OPEN&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&field0-0-0=product&type0-0-0=substring&value0-0-0=isdn&field0-0-1=component&type0-0-1=substring&value0-0-1=isdn&field0-0-2=short_desc&type0-0-2=substring&value0-0-2=isdn&field0-0-3=status_whiteboard&type0-0-3=substring&value0-0-3=isdn
None of the workarounds (modifying ksymc.c etc.) don't seem to work for
now (the modules get loaded but don't work etc.)
The question is, has anybody got it working and how? I think it's a
major issue to address in 2.6.0 before it becomes stable.
Regards,
Danijel
