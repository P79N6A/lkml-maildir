getdents() do not return the type of entry. And if you will make lstat()
paint long names as symlinks - $DEITY pity you. Symlinks are not supposed
to change when you rename them. Symlinks are not supposed to follow the
objects they are pointing to when those objects are renamed. Symlinks are
not supposed to become directories when renamed (and the object they point
to is not supposed to disapper after that operation). Moreover,
rename("foo.boring.and.mighty/","42") will have to do interesting things
with dentry of short form of the source - it must be moved, it can't be
dropped (it may be someone's CWD and dropping *those* is not fun) and it
will have to share its place with the moved source dentry.
	Unfortunately long names are anything but symlinks.
