Not to enter into any of the other discussions on this issue, I wouldn't
usually do what you suggest above. Sure, for operations like accept() that
are inherently inefficient, I would loop until EAGAIN, but if I did I
a recv() or read() of 2K, and I only received 1K, there is no reason why
another system call should be invoked on the resource that likely will not
have any data ready.
