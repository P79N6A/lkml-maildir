Your statement makes a hell of a lot more sense to me, but I'm just
going on what I was told, and observed behavior.
As soon as I followed his instructions, the symptom went away. Basically
on this one machine, I'm getting tons of command timed out, resetting
card messages. Along with unknown ioctl messages. Snippet from dmesg
follows:
3w-xxxx: scsi0: Unit #0: Command (0xdfeb4400) timed out, resetting card.
3w-xxxx: Unknown ioctl 0x46.
3w-xxxx: Unknown ioctl 0x46.
3w-xxxx: Unknown ioctl 0x46.
3w-xxxx: scsi0: Unit #0: Command (0xdfeb4400) timed out, resetting card.
3w-xxxx: Unknown ioctl 0x46.
3w-xxxx: Unknown ioctl 0x46.
3w-xxxx: Unknown ioctl 0x46.
3w-xxxx: Unknown ioctl 0x46.
3w-xxxx: Unknown ioctl 0x46.
3w-xxxx: scsi0: Unit #0: Command (0xdfeb4800) timed out, resetting card.
3w-xxxx: Unknown ioctl 0x46.
3w-xxxx: Unknown ioctl 0x46.
3w-xxxx: Unknown ioctl 0x46.
3w-xxxx: scsi0: Unit #0: Command (0xdfeb4800) timed out, resetting card.
Have not seen any of those with the .016 driver.
I'm more than happy to test any changes/etc. to make this go away with
current drivers, but it'll need to be code for 2.4.x as I haven't
started doing anything with 2.5/2.6 yet.
