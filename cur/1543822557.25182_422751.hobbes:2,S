This patch interferes with using a traditional bootloader.  The loader 
for Xen should be smarter - it already has VIRT_BASE from the xen_guest 
section, and can simply add the relocation to these header fields.  This 
is unnecessary, and one of the many reasons a Xen kernel can't run in a 
normal environment.
