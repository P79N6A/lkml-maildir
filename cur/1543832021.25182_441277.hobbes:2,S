The POSIX thread api? 
Anyway, who cares? The final word on the kernel is that "volatile" is 
wrong. Arguing against that standpoint is pointless, especially since 
other real kernel developers have already stood up to back me up on this.
In user programs, you can do whatever you damn well please. I don't care, 
it's not my problem.
