the reason it isn't easily feasible is that you can learn that the
writepage fails way after the process isn't mapping the page anymore and
we can't keep unowned unwriteable dirty pages  around for long, we've to
drop them. if the vm tried to writepage it means no one single task had
such page mapped, so at that time of the failure we've no clue of who to
notify for such page, all tasks just thought to have written the data
successfully when the pte dirty bit is been trasmitted to the page dirty
bit, by the time the page dirty bit is lost because writepage fails it's
too late to let know the task about it, the task may be exited long ago.
We lose track of the task when we trasmit the dirty information
from pagetable to pte, and only after that happens we will attempt a
writepage. So as far as I can tell the only way to fix it and to for
example reliably send a signal to a task to notify a write is been lost,
is to run the fs get_block(create = 1) while trasmitting the dirty bit
from pte_t to page_t, which isn't a trivial change, certainly not
something that would be confortable to do in 2.4 and it would affect
performance, it is much cleaner and efficient to deal with the fs only
at the page_t phyical pagecache layer rather than at the pte layer.
Lefting unowned, unfreeable pages around by marking the page dirty when
block_write_full_page fails, doesn't look a viable option, the kernel
could do nothing but loop forever trying to write in such case.
