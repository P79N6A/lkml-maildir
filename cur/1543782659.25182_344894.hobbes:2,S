You're right that it can get two "faults" there, but it's such a rare case
(ptrace modifying an area readonly to the process) that I didn't bother
about it.  It isn't even two real faults, just two iterations within
get_user_pages - or does that somehow get worse in the UML case?

We always prefer not to read from the disk.  You're right that we could
choose to remove the page from the swap cache at that point (locking
considerations?) and make it private (in the case where it has actually
been written to the disk, often not yet so), but that's not how the page
cache has ever been treated.  Avoid going to slow disk at all costs.
