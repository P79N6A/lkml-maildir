So i buy a book; clearly the reason it's written in english is so that I can
extend and alter it.   So I rip out the last chapter and replace it with one
of my own.   Now _clearly_ i can distribute this new work around the world
without any fear of being sued by the copyright holders because it's fair use.
NOT!
Now before you try to argue that altering copyrighted source code is fair
use but altering copyrighted books isn't; just stop.  Please leave this 
matter to the lawyers and off this list.
