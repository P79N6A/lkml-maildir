Rerunning lilo is correct fix. But modify your lilo.conf and /etc/fstab to 
reflect eventual changes in partition names first. - You said that two 
partitions are getting merged so there might be changes...

This is not true. NTFS driver will NEVER write to your file system unless 
it is mounted read-write. Even if journalling was implemented it still 
wouldn't write to your fs when mounted read only as long as I have 
something to say about it! Read only means read only IMO, full stop, end of 
discussion. - If you have ever seen it write to the disk when mounted read 
only please let me know as I consider this an extremely serious bug!
