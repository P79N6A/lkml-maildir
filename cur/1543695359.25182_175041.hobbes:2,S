Hi all,
I was upgrading kernel on my server this one day last week. I have
2.6.0-test4 running there happily. But I lost it's config somehow so I
started everything from the beginning.
I first tried to upgrade to -test8 and had some random lockups (The
lockups happened about two minutes after reboot). So I tested -test9
there today. And still got random lockups, after modification of config
my server did hang on for seven hours, and again lockup. 
My test4 was running for 60 days without any problems, untill I decided
to upgrade. And I found no errors in log files from the crash time, so
this is probably a total mystery. I'll attach my config[1], lspci[2] and
lsmod[3] output so you'll see if there's something wrong.
Any suggestions would be welcome. I can't reboot the server many times,
but if you see something wrong straight ahead just tell me.
Thank you.
