You can compile and use bt848 without V4L1 turned on.  It still has some
V4L1 functions defined.

I think this is pretty much what I've been saying.  Drivers should:
A. Not include videodev.h, but use videodev2.h
B. Include videodev.h, but be marked V4L1 in Kconfig
C. #ifdef around videodev.h (and code that needs videodev.h), so it
   is not included or needed when V4L1 is turned off.
