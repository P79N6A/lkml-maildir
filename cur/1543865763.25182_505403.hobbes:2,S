And as I explained earlier you get false values. The existing hack is
dodgy as well and breaks on suspend/resume then loading the driver for
one. It's probably the best that can be done without ACPI but the ACPI
_GTM/_STM methods are pretty clean so its not hard to use them. You need
them for full suspend/resume support anyway.
