In fact, you don't even need to do that. Here's why:
 Q> The first part of the compilation process for BOTH `make zImage`
 Q> and `make bzImage` is identical, and results in the file vmlinux
 Q> (note the 'x' at the end) in /usr/src/linux (or whatever the base
 Q> directory is).
Therefore, the following script will work, if run from the relevant
base directory - replace menuconfig as preferred:
 Q> #!/bin/bash
 Q> make menuconfig
 Q> if [ ! -f .config ]; then
 Q>     echo 'ERROR 99: Kernel configuration not available.' >&2
 Q>     exit 99
 Q> fi
 Q> if [ ! -f .depend ] || [ .config -nt .depend ]; then
 Q>     make dep clean
 Q>     if [ $? -gt 0 ]; then
 Q>         exit $?
 Q>     fi
 Q> fi
 Q> if grep 'CONFIG_MODULES=y' < .config > /dev/null ; then
 Q>     make modules modules_install
 Q>     if [ $? -gt 0 ]; then
 Q>         exit $?
 Q>     fi
 Q> fi
 Q> make zImage
 Q> if [ $? -gt 0 -a -f vmlinux ]; then
 Q>     make bzImage
 Q> fi
 Q> exit $?
Best wishes from Riley.
