Well process context defeats the purpose. Ok, I've more closely read
your report and if I understand correctly, you're using the NAPI
version of e100? There's some magic NAPI bits in netpoll_poll that
might help here:
        if(trapped && np->dev->poll &&
           test_bit(__LINK_STATE_RX_SCHED, &np->dev->state))
                np->dev->poll(np->dev, &budget);
Perhaps we need to pull the trapped test out of there. Then with any
luck, dev->hard_start_xmit will return non-zero in netpoll_send_skb,
we'll call netpoll_poll to pump the card, and we'll be able to flush
it.
