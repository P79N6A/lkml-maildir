-and send the output the maintainer of the kernel area that seems to be
-involved with the problem. Don't worry too much about getting the wrong
-person. If you are unsure send it to the person responsible for the code
-relevant to what you were doing. If it occurs repeatably try and describe
-how to recreate it. Thats worth even more than the oops
-
-If you are totally stumped as to whom to send the report, send it to 
-linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.edu. Thanks for your help in making Linux as
-stable as humanly possible.
