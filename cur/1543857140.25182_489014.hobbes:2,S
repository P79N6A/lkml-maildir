The only use of the early pci code is for finding the hardware.  Everything
else is through mmio.
The practical issue is that during the normal initialization of the ehci 
the reset of the hardware state is going to remove the delegation to the
ehci debug registers.
Greg's current thing uses the hardware but through the normal interrupt
driven usb methods.  I think it is worth using the ehci debug registers
if possible as that (except for reset) gives us independent control of
what is going on.
For understanding what needs to happen except for the initialization just
look at my dbgp_bulk_write routine.  That and the functions it call is
the only code in there that is executed.  It is just a hair more complicated
than other early debug port code because it has to deal with retransmits.
But I think it is still under 100 lines of code.
