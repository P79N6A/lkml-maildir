yes. You can always find the latest and greatest LFS in my 2.2 tree (I
also accept patches regularly for it):
	
ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.2/2.2.20pre2aa1/40_lfs-2.2.19pre16aa1-26.bz2
It is not against vanilla 2.2.19 or vanilla 2.2.20pre2 so you need to
apply a few other patches in my tree first or to fix the few rejects by
hand, but if you need lfs you probably need the other features as well,
so you can more simply use the whole 2.2.20pre2aa1 patchkit.
