Well, the original desire was to stop new drivers getting in without
proper power management. For this to help achieve that aim, one or more
of the following would need to happen:
* developers of new drivers would have to remember to run the test
after/during writing their driver. Of course if they remember to do
this, they've already remembered that they need to implement power
management;
* you, I or someone else would need to test all these trees before
Andrew and Linus merge them and report problems to the developers before
they get their new drivers merged;
* Andrew or Linus would run it prior to or after merging a whole lot of
stuff.
I'm afraid I don't like the chances of any of those things happening, so
I'm not sure that it is an acceptable alternative from my perspective. 
Sticking a printk in dmesg doesn't exactly put the problem in flashing
red 36 point characters before the developer either, but I think they're
slightly more likely to see it there if only because they might stick
printks in that they want to read (eg perhaps while debugging the
driver) and therefore see the message when checking output from the
driver being loaded/initialised.
Maybe another alternative would be to make the warnings compile time
warnings - if that's possible?
