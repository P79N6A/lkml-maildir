Andrew,
the following two patches are the outcome of the thread "brk randomization 
breaks columns" [1]. As brk randomization is already in Linus' tree, it's 
definitely 2.6.25 material, so it would probably be good if you could push 
them in your next bunch going to Linus, if noone has any objections.
I think it's better if they go through you than through Ingo, as they are 
not x86-specific at all.
Thanks.
