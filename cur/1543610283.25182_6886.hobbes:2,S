No dave, I read it, and I am not trying to create a slab cache twice.  I
only
create it once.  I did go look at the code and I got the part of using an
invalid
opcode to generate an exception.  Sort of like an int3 embedded in the
code (the old NetWare/NT way).  :-)

Dave,  I went and looked at this stuff.  I have been running this code for
over a year on 2.4 and I AM NOT CREATING A SLAB CACHE TWICE!!!!
I am building an NWFS module external of the kernel tree, and unless make
dep
has been run, the default behavior of the includes causes me to drop into
the
BUG() trap.
