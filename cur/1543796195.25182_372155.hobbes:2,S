Which is perfectly the point Kyle made. 
The timer tells you that the cookies or your breakfast eggs are well
done. You put them out of the oven or the pot at exactly the time when
the timer event happens. You won't turn off the timer before your
cookies/eggs are done, because you want them well done.
The timeout you set up is to remind you to switch off the oven before
your kitchen starts to burn. This timeout is likely - not sure in your
personal case :) - to be cancelled because you did think about switching
off the oven in time. If you forgot it, it is not a big difference if
you get the reminder 5 minutes earlier or later. 
In case of the egg / cookie timer the distcintion of 1 to 5 minutes
makes a big difference.
