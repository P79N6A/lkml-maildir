By slow, I meant having enough time between posting the RFC/patch and
its getting included in -mm or mainline. The AIO core code is tricky and
subtle in parts, so it is better to err on the side of caution during such
cleanups, at least give ourselves time to remember why something was there
in the first place. Especially now that there are several out-of-tree patches
under re-consideration.

Its not a big deal either way in this particular case - possibly only
some redundant work eventually. And I think its already in -mm anyway.
I'm just raising the flag about the need to be very careful about cleanups
in this part of the code in general.  Under such circumstances, I would
tend to look at it from the angle of "Is there a value in removing it ?"
rather than the other way around.
