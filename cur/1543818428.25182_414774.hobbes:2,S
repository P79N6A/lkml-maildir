> Andrew Morton pointed out that compiler might not inline the functions
> marked for inline in kprobes. There by allowing the insertion of probes
> on these kprobes routines, which might cause recursion. This patch
> removes all such inline and adds them to kprobes section there by
> disallowing probes on all such routines. Some of the routines can
> even still be inlined, since these routines gets executed after
> the kprobes had done necessay setup for reentrancy.
