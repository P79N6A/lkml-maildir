   Dave, what performance do you get with the sk98 using normal size
   frames? (to compare apples with apples). BTW - i can't try jumbo
   frames due to my crappy 3com gig switch.
Use a cross-over cable to play with Jumbo frames, that is
what I do :-)
Later this week I'll rerun tests on all the cards I have
(Acenic, Sk98, tigon3, Natsemi etc.) with current drivers
to see what it looks like with both jumbo and non-jumbo
mtus over gigabit.
