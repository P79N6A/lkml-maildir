I first thought that too, but then looking at the code I noticed:
int do_setitimer(int which, struct itimerval *value, struct itimerval *ovalue)
{
        struct task_struct *tsk = current;
Where tsk is current.  So the only ones that can change the
tsk->signal->real_timer seems to be the task itself and ksoftirqd. So
between del_timer_sync (which handles the ksoftirqd part) and the
spin_lock, there's no one else that can modify tsk->signal->real_timer.
So I don't believe that there is a race condition here.
[thinks about this a little]
Oh wait, is ->signal shared among threads?  Damn, I think so! So you are
right, another _thread_ can come and change this. I forgot about threads
(they're evil! ;-).

OK, for the -mm branch this may work. But for the current tree, we may
need to do something else.  Like this ugly patch. But it should work!
int do_setitimer(int which, struct itimerval *value, struct itimerval *ovalue)
{
        struct task_struct *tsk = current;
	static spinlock_t lock = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED;
[...]
		spin_lock(&lock);
		spin_unlock(&tsk->sighand->siglock);
		del_timer_sync(&tsk->signal->real_timer);
		spin_lock(&tsk->sighand->siglock);
		spin_unlock(&lock);
This would handle the case for threads in the main line kernel, but it
looks (to me) pretty ugly, but should work. I also don't like this
because it is shared among all tasks!
Andrew, (or Roland since I see Andrew added you to the list)
  
 What do you think? Should try_to_del_timer_sync be brought over to the
mainline, or have the above ugly code added?
