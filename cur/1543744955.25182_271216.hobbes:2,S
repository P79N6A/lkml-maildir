Possibly yes, unfortunately :-( All places where a node's keys change
would have to be updated, yes. Are there cases where vm_pgoff,
vm_start, or vm_end can change without doing a prio_tree_insert or
vma_prio_tree_insert afterwards ? If not, the key update could just
be moved into vma_prio_tree_insert and vma_prio_tree_add.

Nope :-) We already have space for adding one more long, i.e. h_index.
So all we need to do it to calculate and set it before going to
prio_tree.
For r_index, one can use what I've described in the last mail.

Yes, it starts to look fairly heavy for what it does ...
