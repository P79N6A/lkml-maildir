Also remember that even if you do larger pages by using virtual pairs or
quads of real pages because it helps on some systems you end up needing
the same sized sglist as before so you don't make anything worse for
half-assed controllers as you get the same I/O size providing they have
the minimal 2 or 4 sg list entries (and those that don't are genuinely
beyond saving and nowdays very rare)
