I've just compiled "linux-2.4.20-ac1". 
It reports "DMA disabled" messages on boot for all of my IDE drives:
 |   VP_IDE: VIA vt82c686a (rev 22) IDE UDMA66 controller on pci00:07.1
 |     ide0: BM-DMA at 0xd000-0xd007, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
 |     ide1: BM-DMA at 0xd008-0xd00f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:DMA
 | hda: WDC WD400BB-53AUA1, ATA DISK drive
 | hda: DMA disabled
 | blk: queue c02918a0, I/O limit 4095Mb (mask 0xffffffff)
 | hdc: WDC WD1000BB-00CAA0, ATA DISK drive
 | hdd: CD-540E, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
 | hdc: DMA disabled
 | blk: queue c0291d0c, I/O limit 4095Mb (mask 0xffffffff)
 | hdd: DMA disabled
However, "hdparm" reports DMA mode to be enabled for all drives:
 | pc01:~ # hdparm -d /dev/hda
 | 
 | /dev/hda:
 |  using_dma    =  1 (on)
 | pc01:~ # hdparm -d /dev/hdc
 | 
 | /dev/hdc:
 |  using_dma    =  1 (on)
 | pc01:~ # hdparm -d /dev/hdd
 | 
 | /dev/hdd:
 |  using_dma    =  1 (on)
What might be the reason for this behaviour?
SuSE's start scripts seem to activate DMA mode explicitly only for the 
CD-ROM drive ("hdd"), so I suppose that the "DMA disabled" messages the 
kernel reports for "hda" and "hdc" are not true. 
The same messages I had using "linux-2.4.20-rc4-ac1" and
"linux-2.4.20-rc2-ac3".
More information (kernel config, full dmesg output, lspci output) is 
available at:
