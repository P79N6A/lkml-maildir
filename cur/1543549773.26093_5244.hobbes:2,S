Yes, I'm inclined to agree. Or at least not disagree. I'm more arguing
that the order itself may not be the most interesting thing, and that I
don't think the balancing has to take the order of the allocation into
account - because it should be equivalent to just tell that it's a soft
allocation (whether though the current !__GFP_HIGH or through a new
__GFP_SOFT with slightly different logic).
