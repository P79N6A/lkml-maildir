you still can't have that. think USB harddisks for example. The only way
you can do this reliable is to use UUIDs from the disks. Guess what..
udev does that. devfs doesn't.
Same for PCI hotplug; the "path" to your pci IDE controller might change
after you "hotplugged" some stuff. And no that's not just high end
hardware; most docking stations are like this too. Again, only the disk
UUID is usable for getting stable naming.

actually.. linphone for example shows you the name of the device, not
the device node. And at runtime it finds which device node belongs to
that name somehow. I didn't look at the code how it does that, but it
sure isn't impossible since it's done in practice already.
