This problem is commonly found in an embedded SCSI system where there is no IDE hard drive. In that case, the cdrom device will have the device node /dev/hda. If you issue the command:
  cat /proc/ide/hda/identify
  or try to read the file /proc/ide/hda/identify
the kernel will print out the following message to the system log:
       "hda: bad special flag 0x03"
The user may think something is wrong but in reality nothing is wrong. And we don't want to see this message comes out when nothing is wrong.

> the message "hda: bad special flag 0x03" gets written to the system log.  This will happen because the .config file that RedHat uses to create the kernel image has the flag CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDECD=m.  Thus in ide.c code, it won't call ide_cdrom_reinit(). So for CDROM the special flag is left as 0x03.
