Hello to all!
Does anyone know if there is an unwinding library for
user level apps available somewhere for amd64 linux?
I have a simple unwinder that I wrote that just grabs
the fp and steps through looking for symbols, however,
I can not get it work on amd64 platform (my trace gets
lost when it enters a sig handler).
I have searched around and found one for itanic, but
nothing else.
TIA!
Phy
