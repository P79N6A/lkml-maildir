After some debugging it looks like it takes a long time to processes
lines similar to,
/*************************************
 * Bit definitions for each register *
 *************************************/
#define LCR_BITS_5              0x00    /* 5 bits/char */
#define LCR_BITS_6              0x01    /* 6 bits/char */
#define LCR_BITS_7              0x02    /* 7 bits/char */
#define LCR_BITS_8              0x03    /* 8 bits/char */
#define LCR_BITS_MASK           0x03    /* Mask for bits/char field */
There's a section in the code which has several of these. The processing
slows down when this expression matches repeatedly,
# Check for potential 'bare' types
                my ($stat, $cond, $line_nr_next, $remain_next, $off_next);
                if ($realcnt && $line =~ /.\s*\S/) {
                        ($stat, $cond, $line_nr_next, $remain_next, $off_next) =
                                ctx_statement_block($linenr, $realcnt, 0);
and ctx_statement_block will process $realcnt lines trying to find a
complete block, and it has no concept of "define" so it just keep
processing until it's concept of a block ending.. That happens on each
"define" line in the file, which I think accounts for all the overhead.
I added the following temporary work around, which speeds things up
considerably. Just forcing it to only process one line at most.
