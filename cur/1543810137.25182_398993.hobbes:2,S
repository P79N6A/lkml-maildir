I'm not sure how standard that is. For example, I looked at the asus
and toshiba drivers. These ACPI board drivers use
/proc/acpi/somedevice/lcd. For example,
asus_acpi.c
894                 asus_proc_add(PROC_LCD, &proc_write_lcd,
&proc_read_lcd, mode,
895                               device);
toshiba_acpi.c
472         {"lcd", read_lcd, write_lcd},
So, that's why I chose to do the same in my implementation. I'd have
much rather used a generic sysfs entry but that's not what any ACPI
drivers appear to do. Further, I see that Patrick Mochel is rewriting
the whole acpi driver model (and incorporating sysfs) anyway so I
figured I'd go with the flow of existing drivers. Perhaps someone
could clarify what the consensus is. I'd be happy to make any desired
adjustments.

I'll go take a look at that. I didn't look for an acpi driver outside
of the drivers/acpi directory. But if that's the consensus, shouldn't
someone also mod the toshiba and asus drivers?

Standard wallmount stuff. There's 8 buttons on the one I'm using for
testing. Vol up/down. Brightness up/down. Then several buttons for
miscellaneous usage by people who customize the chassis. Most apps for
this type of board are custom written and tend to just select on
/proc/acpi/event.

I would have loved to make it an input driver. But looking at the
mailing list archives, that seems to be a bone of contention and hence
I chose to go with the flow. I'll be happy to switch it over to an
input driver if there is consensus around that. Please do let me know.
