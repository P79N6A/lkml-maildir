[root@adelphi /root]# uptime 
  4:26am  up 273 days,  1:34, 17 users,  load average: 0.15, 0.18, 0.14
ie it wrapped 273 days ago. :) 734 days. it's the standard RH 2.2.16 
kernel from RH6.1.
hanvt noticed any funnies whatsoever. (except init and some other
long running procs seem to have a start time that varies whenever you
run ps, which isnt right.)
