I hate to follow up to my own message, but I've got some more to add.
I had the system completely stop talking through the 3Com interface last
night.  I had to come in to work and reboot the system to get it talking
to the network again.  When I got here, I noticed that the light on that
port on my hub was even out.  I remember way back I used to have this
kind of trouble with older 3c590 cards and the old 3c59x.c driver, and
the trick then was to ifconfig eth0 down then ifconfig eth0 up, so I
tried that last night - no luck.  I had to reboot the system to get the
network interface back up.
I don't think this is a cable/hub or driver issue, since 2.0.36 talks
through the same interface just fine (zero lost packets).  But if I use
the driver from 2.0.36 in 2.2.5, I get the pauses (and eventual hang).
What could be causing this?
