There is only one queue per callback device.

There may be several connectors with different socket types.
I use it in my environment for tests.

? Nothing stops clients from sending several notification requests now.
I do not see how it simplifies the things?
Feel free to set idx_num and val_num to 1 and you will have the same.

Current implementation has big warning about such theoretical behaviour, 
if it will be triggered, I will fix that behaviour, 
more likely not by naive work allocation - there might be
at least cache/memory pool or something...

You mess up layers.
I do not see why you want it.

Connector with your changes just does not work.
Dmitry, I do not understand why do you change things in so radical manner,
especially when there are no 1. new interesting features, 2. no performance
improvements, 3. no right design changes.

You substitute license agreements with copyright.
"All rights reserved" is targeted to copyright 
(avtorskoe pravo, zakon N 5351/1-1) of the code
and has nothing with license.
