Just like the case just pointed out in your 'net' version
of this patch, it is being tested "<= 0" so this fix
is not necessary at all.
Please carefully review all of your changes of this kind
to make sure the test is strictly equality to zero rather
than <= 0.
I'm dropping all of these postfix decrement patches.
