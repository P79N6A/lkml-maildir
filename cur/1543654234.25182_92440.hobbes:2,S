I'm not talking about a device driver, but modularizing the IPv4
stack.

As I realized last night after I wrote this, there is a bug in
module.c.  If O_NONBLOCK is specified, we shouldn't drop the module
sempaphore at all, for exactly this reason.  A bug I introduced while
"cleaning up" the "--wait" path.
Sorry for the confusion.

Non-removable is easy.  It's now possible to do removable IPv4 and
IPv6, which was kind of the point of the exercise.
Hope that helps,
Rusty.
