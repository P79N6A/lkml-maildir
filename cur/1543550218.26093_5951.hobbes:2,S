Do you really think that explicitly supporting broken distributions
(redhat 7.0 comes with a experimental snapshot of gcc which is neither
binary compatible to 2.95 nor to 3.0, cutting binary compatibility to all
other gnu/linux distributions) really is the right thing? ;)
Anyway, the gcc project was just forced to bump the version number of gcc
to 2.97 so it became possible to identify borken wild 2.96's from official
gcc snapshots...
