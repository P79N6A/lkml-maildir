. and foo/. are also links, not directories... the directories themselves 
are filesystem internal objects, and not discussed by the standard.  I 
didn't know that linux supported hard links to directories... Isn't that 
just asking for trouble?

intentionally, afaict) should fail, but you can do something intelligent 
instead, you probably should.
