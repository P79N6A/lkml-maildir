I have add support for generating modules.isapnpmap to my modutils
tree, basically a clone of modules.pcimap.  ISAPNP_CARD_TABLE is more
of a problem.
struct isapnp_card_id {
	unsigned short card_vendor, card_device;
	struct {
		unsigned short vendor, function;
	} devs[ISAPNP_CARD_DEVS];       /* logical devices */
	unsigned long driver_data;      /* data private to the driver */
};
Modutils and the kernel are compiled from different headers, none of
this #include <linux/xxx.h> business in modutils.  So you must never
assume that the structures in modutils and in the kernel have the same
specification.  Since ISAPNP_CARD_DEVS is #defined and can be changed,
that value must be exported to user space.  Also putting driver_data
after the array might cause parsing problems if the array size changes,
driver_data should be before the array.
Solution 1:
struct isapnp_card_id {
	unsigned short card_vendor, card_device;
	int isapnp_card_devs;
	unsigned long driver_data;      /* data private to the driver */
	struct {
		unsigned short vendor, function;
	} devs[ISAPNP_CARD_DEVS];       /* logical devices */
};
isapnp_card_devs is set to ISAPNP_CARD_DEVS for every struct isapnp_card_id.
Solution 2:
struct isapnp_card_id {
	unsigned short card_vendor, card_device;
	unsigned long driver_data;      /* data private to the driver */
	struct {
		unsigned short vendor, function;
	} devs[ISAPNP_CARD_DEVS];       /* logical devices */
};
static int isapnp_card_devs = ISAPNP_CARD_DEVS;
EXPORT_SYMBOL(isapnp_card_devs);
isapnp_card_devs only has to be defined once, probably in isapnp.c.
In either case depmod can print modules.isapnp_cardmap data as
Print 1:
# module             cardvendor carddevice driver_data vendor     function ...
eepro100             0x00008086 0x00001229 0x00000000  0x00008086 0x00001229 ... all non-zero devs entries on one line
or as
Print 2:
# module             cardvendor carddevice driver_data vendor     function
eepro100             0x00008086 0x00001229 0x00000000  0x00008086 0x00001229 one line per non-zero devs entry
Which solution do you want?
Which print format do you want?
