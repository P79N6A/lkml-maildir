OK, in terms of code, it is new API. Just the refcounting mechanism
is same as existing non-kref refcounts.

I am reasonably sure that when that patch was done (months ago) kref wasn't
there. Now that kref.[ch] is around, everything can be put there.
Now, if struct kref is shrinked (want patch ? ;-), all this 
can possibly be nicely collapsed into one set of APIs for refcounting.
There aren't many users of kref yet, so this seems like a good
time to do it. Was there any objection to shrinking it ?
Thanks
