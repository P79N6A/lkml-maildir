Subject: [BUG Report] Hacks in IDE (perhaps) section => 2.6.8 make REALLYbad audio-cd's

Hello, I'm not a developer, but I've noticed that EVERY kernel version
later than 2.6.7 (excluding that) have a bug when burning any audio cd,
causing bad "jumps" every second or so...
I maintained the same conf. from 2.6.2 to 2.6.8.1 (even 2.6.10 is
affected), and even when changing something, no effect.
FYI if you want I can upload an audio sample somewhere.
Any idea?
