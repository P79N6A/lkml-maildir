   IMHO, there are no such thibg as multisession audio CDs. Regular
CD-Audio players (not CD-ROM readers) only look at the first session,
ignoring all others (that's what's used in CD-Extra - The first session is
audio and the second is data). I believe that CD-ROM readers also have
this limitation as far as audio is concerned. It makes no sense in having
audio tracks in a second or third session, as CD readers don't see them.
Also, note that common CD burning software allow you to record audio
tracks without closing the session, so you can record several tracks in
several recording sessions (make no confusion with session in a
multisession disk), only closing the session when you want to take it to
you stereo CD player.
