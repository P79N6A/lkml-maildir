Unfortunately EDD30 isn't implemented by very many BIOSs or option roms.
The Adaptec aic7xxx series BIOSs and recent LSI-based PERC3 BIOSs are the
only ones I've found that do, but their implementations are slightly buggy.
Granted, I've limited my testing to those cards and/or onboard devices that
Dell sells.
I made a simple DOS program if people want to test boards for themselves.
(EDD30 specifies a real mode int13 extension, so it was easy to to it in
DOS, only slightly harder to do it in the boot loader or kernel before
switching to protected mode.)  Posted to 
http://domsch.com/linux/edd30/.
There's a results page there that I'm starting to fill in.  Please send
results to edd30@domsch.com per the README included.
Thanks,
Matt
