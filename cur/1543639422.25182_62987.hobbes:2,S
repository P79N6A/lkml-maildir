I have been having problems with ext3 hardlocking while in X and in
Console. Symptom one is while in console moving large ammounts of data
around between partions it will hardlock. Symptom two is sometimes I
will leave my computer for a few minutes (on a very rar occasion :P )
when i return x is hardlocked. Was running XFS and Resierfs before I
tried ext3 and never had these problems. Any information I can provide
let me know.
