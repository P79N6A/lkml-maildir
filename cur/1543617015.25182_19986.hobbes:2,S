Hi Andrew, Jeff
	My 3c905B[1] (2.4.18-pre3) always autonegotiates 10baseTx Half
Duplex whenever i use a crossover cable (works fine on a 100 switch and a
10/100 Hub). The link partner is a Realtek RTL-8139A [2] (2.5.2-pre11) and
reports the following if i boot it after the 3com box;
eth0: Setting half-duplex based on auto-negotiated partner ability 0000.
Forcing 100BaseTx/FD on the 3com ends up in nothing being able to go out
the wire (destination host unreachable).
mii-diag on the 3com box gives the following
Basic registers of MII PHY #0:  c000 c000 c000 c000 c000 c000 c000 c000.
 The autonegotiated capability is 0000.
No common media type was autonegotiated!
This is extremely unusual and typically indicates a configuration error.
Perhaps the advertised capability set was intentionally limited.
 Basic mode control register 0xc000: Auto-negotiation disabled, with
 Speed fixed at 10 mbps, half-duplex.
  Transceiver in loopback mode!
  Transceiver currently being reset!
 Basic mode status register 0xc000 ... c000.
   Link status: not established.
 Your link partner advertised c000:.
   End of basic transceiver information.
mii-diag on the 8139A box
Basic registers of MII PHY #32:  0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000.
 Basic mode control register 0x0000: Auto-negotiation disabled, with
 Speed fixed at 10 mbps, half-duplex.
 Basic mode status register 0x0000 ... 0000.
   Link status: not established.
 Link partner information is not exchanged when in fixed speed mode.
   End of basic transceiver information.
All drivers are modular with no module parameters. The 3com negotiates
100BaseTx/FD in FreeBSD 4.4 and NetBSD 1.5 using the same link partner.
