umm, OK, I queued it for 2.6.24.  I'll give people a day or so to comment
on this.
I had to invent some silly changlelog for it.  Please review it for
accuracy and completeness?
It isn't complete, really.  How come we only make max_cstate writeable if
CONFIG_CPU_IDLE=n?  What happens to people who were reliant upon writeable
max_cstate who now enable CPU_IDLE?  Things still break?  What is the
rationale behind this?  What constraints led us to this decision?
From: Venki Pallipadi <venkatesh.pallipadi@intel.com>
This was writeable in 2.6.23 but the cpuidle merge made it read-only.  But
some people's scripts (ie: Mark's) were writing to it.
As an unhappy compromise, make max_cstate writeable again if the kernel was
configured without CONFIG_CPU_IDLE.
