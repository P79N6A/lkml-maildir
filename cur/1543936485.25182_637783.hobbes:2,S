Hmm, they should not need to do anything.
When linux calls video BIOS with lcall (acpi_sleep=s3_bios), they
should turn on backlight and put video into text mode. They should
also make sure mode setting works after that.
I don't see how ACPI fits into this picture, and I think it can work
well without ACPI tricks.
