That may be AP-related, but I had no such problems with the bcm43xx used
previously on the same hardware w/ the same AP.

Hm, I wonder what I've done wrong, then. :-)
Can you send me /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 (or whatever the card is
visible as on your system) from the x86_64 laptop?

Well, finally I did configure the card with YaST, but I had to manually add it
to the list.  ifup/ifdown works, but I haven't tried NetworkManager yet.
