If this is still safe for selinux I'm fine with it.  It also gets rid
of one of them few remaining s_files users which is always good.
Btw, after this patch we should be able to kill all places that check
for a non-zero file->f_op because it should never be non-zero.  Of course
we'll need an actual audit first to make sure nothing has been slipping
through.
