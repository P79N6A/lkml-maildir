Let's be accurate: both fat and ext2 CAN use serial numbers. However,
neither is forced to, and certainly with fat partitions, there are
plenty that don't have any serial numbers in place - any formatted
prior to MSDOS 6.00 and never reformatted, for example.
Even with Win9x based systems, there are several formatters around
that achieve higher than normal capacities on fat format floppies that
don't bother putting the serial number (or any other part of the BPB
extension its in) on the said floppy.
Even when they do have a serial number, it's all too common for it to
be duplicated. Indeed, some of the high capacity formatters ALWAYS
allocate the same serial number to the disks they format, and others
allocate the same series of sequence numbers within each formatting
session, which amounts to the same thing.

SCT is probably far more au fait with ext2 tools than I am...

Personally, I believe they are so high that anything that can't give a
rock solid guarantee that it has correctly identified the disk that
was removed shouldn't even be considered.
Best wishes from Riley.
