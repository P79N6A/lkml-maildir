yeah - during the context-switch the value of 'current' might be 'stale' 
in a number of ways, but it's always atomically and coherently either 
pointing to the previous task or the next task. So from a tracing POV 
it's perfectly safe to use it (and we've been doing that for ages with 
the mcount stuff).
(The notrace mcount exclusions arent really to avoid any tracing 
badness, they are mostly to make the trace less spammy and more 
readable.)
