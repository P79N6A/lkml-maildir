Yes, there are some coherency problems various places.
The sequence mkswap; swapon fails for certain kernels,
unless mkswap does fsync(DEV).
Linux does not guarantee coherency between hda and hda1.
For example, cfdisk will show filesystem labels.
If one showed a label (accessed by cfdisk via /dev/hda)
and then changed it (via /dev/hda1) and then used cfdisk
again, the old contents would be shown. Here a BLKFLSBUF helped.
Sometimes the result of fdisk disappears - one uses fdisk,
rechecks with a new fdisk call that all is really well, reboots,
and finds the old partition table. I am not sure what precisely happens.
Perhaps a dirty (super)block written back, destroying fdisk's changes.
Anyway, whole disk access is a bit suspect in Linux.
The BLKFLSBUF and sync() kludges help a little but still
do not guarantee correct operation.
