We can add a check that if the incoming buffer index start and length does
not match the current start and len (as set by cmap_range), then exit with
and empty buffer.
Conversely, users  can always check if the output read from color_map matches
the value it entered in cmap_range.
As a side note:
The rest of the fbsysfs attributes suffer from the same thing, especially since the
value of each attribute depends on each other.  What if one process reads the
virtual_size, while another one changes the bits_per_pixel?  I'm pretty sure that
setting bits_per_pixel to a higher value will almost always change the virtual_size.
Currently, the only way to guarantee atomicity is to use the ioctls. The main
reason why we change the video mode, framebuffer format, color format, etc in one
go with fb_set_var() is precisely this.
