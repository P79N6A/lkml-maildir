Note egcs is also gcc 2.9x. What problems is 2.95.2 supposed to have
with 2.2? And people will come running if something breaks to have
somebody look if it's the kernel (see Alan's mail) or the compiler.

Who decides if it's supported? Anyone who is unable of getting binutils
and gcc release versions compiled? The who is to lazy to upgrade?
Sorry, I still fail to see any evidence. Quote, forward mails, show
broken code (which can then be fixed), give any proof that NOT using
2.95.2 is justified in any way. FUD should be kept off this list.
Now, what's your point? What are you after?
