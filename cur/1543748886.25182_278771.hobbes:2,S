schedule_timeout() specifies a sleep in jiffies -- it's actually a
rather annoying interface for the very reason that it depends on the
value of HZ how *long* you actually will sleep for (in human time
units). So your assumption is incorrect, presuming the code author
knows what they are doing. They wish to sleep for 1/10 the number of
timer ticks in a second. What this translates to, though, clearly
depends on HZ. Thus
msleep{,_interruptible}(100);
would be far better to use (it calls schedule_timeout() correctly
[another thing not done often]). Also, if you look carefully at the
timer code, you'll notice that the x86 timer frequency is not actually
1000 Hz, it's actually less. Thus you run into issues with timer
intervals... But, in any case, specifying a timeout of 100 msecs is
different then specifying a timeout of 100 cycles on x86. I'm not sure
what it exactly translates to, but it will be more. Hence, you should
use msleep() not schedule_timeout() directly. Jiffies should not be
what you base your timing on; msecs & secs are easier and less likely
to be misused.

No, please don't. Use msleep() or msleep_interruptible(). Let the
conversion functions take care of the conversions.

No floating point in the kernel...
