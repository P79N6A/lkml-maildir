Is there a driver inside or outside of the kernel to allow mounting of
sd cards under linux? I have been able to mount compact flash cards but
now sd cards, and I understand from the Zaurus group that the sd group
doesn't release there code.
Is there a project to add support to the kernel? I have a PNY FPT-D
Multireader, and a generic internal reader ( I'm not sure about the name
).
Thanks,
John
