Hi,
[ please cc me with replies. ]
I have asked this upstream at linux-dvb [1] and to the Ubuntu kernel's
bugtracker [2], but no help so far. Googling around, one can find other
reports about this, but no solution, either.
Using a Nova-T dvb card, I get the following in /var/log/messages...
22:09:54 kernel: cx88_wakeup: 2 buffers handled (should be 1)
22:09:57 kernel: cx88_wakeup: 2 buffers handled (should be 1)
22:10:06 kernel: cx88_wakeup: 2 buffers handled (should be 1)
22:10:09 kernel: cx88_wakeup: 2 buffers handled (should be 1)
22:10:12 kernel: cx88_wakeup: 2 buffers handled (should be 1)
22:10:15 kernel: cx88_wakeup: 2 buffers handled (should be 1)
...every few seconds while watching TV with xine or other dvb-apps. The
event results in a visible interruption of the video stream.
Looking on the net for solutions, I tried these:
- changing pci latency in the bios settings
- putting the card into a different pci slot
- using "pci=routeirq" or "pci=noacpi" kernel boot parameters
NONE of these solved the problem.
Please see [2] for more info.
The problem appears with three different recent Linux distribution
kernels: Ubuntu 2.6.22-7-generic, Ubuntu 2.6.20-15-generic, Suse
2.6.18.2-34-default.
The problem is not hardware-specific, it appears with an Intel CPU and
Intel chipset as well as with an AMD CPU and a VIA chipset.
The problem appears to be shared irq resources [3]. However, my
mainboard doesn't allow to choose specific irqs for pci slots and
anyway, shared irqs shouldn't break this dvb card, in the first place.
What else can I try?
Thanks for any help,
Hanno
