If a "module" (whether built as a loadable module or builtin to the
kernel image) uses module_param() with a permission (or mode) field
that allows reading that parameter, then the parameter will show up
in /sys/module/<module>/parameters/<parameter>.
E.g., drivers/scsi/sg has these parameters listed and are readable
by anyone:
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Sep  5 10:07 allow_dio
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Sep  5 10:07 def_reserved_size
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4096 Sep  5 10:07 scatter_elem_sz
However, the st driver uses 0 for permission (mode), so none of its
parameters is visible.
