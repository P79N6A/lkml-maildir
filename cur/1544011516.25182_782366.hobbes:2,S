The series of patches:
1. use module's refcount instead of self-maintained use field;
2. use pointer reference instead of making a copy of target_type;
3. totally remove tt_internal;
The 3rd patch may be controversial,

But I still think it's worth it:
1. current users of struct target_type hasn't been marked with const, just
   static;
2. other similar structures (file_system_type in filesystems, packet_type in
   net core, ) all have internally used list_head for manage purpose;
   this design can avoid memory frag from kmalloc/kfree.
