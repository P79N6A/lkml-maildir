Aha, I see.
The last question. The 'srcu-2' you posted today does synchronize_srcu_flip()
twice. You did it this way because srcu is optimized for readers, otherwise we
could just add smp_rmb() into srcu_read_lock() - this should solve the problem
as well.
Is my understanding correct?
Thanks!
Oleg.
