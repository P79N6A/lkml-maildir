I've just tried udev 073 from Debian unstable, with a freshly pulled
kernel 2.6.14 from earlier in the evening on 11/7.  Same failure:
/dev/input only has /dev/input/event3, and is missing the event0, event1,
and event2 files that is present if I boot 2.6.14.
So is this a Debian bug, a kernel bug, or a udev bug?  What is going
on?  I don't know enough about recent changes to udev and/or the
events sent to udev to start debugging this, but this is something
that works in 2.6.14 and fails post-2.6.14....  
So this is what I believe Andrew would call "a regression".  :-)
