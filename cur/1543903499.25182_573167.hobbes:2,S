I don't know your code at all but the diffstat suggests that "lru
cache", "worker", "receiver", and "bitmap" could possibly be made
independent patches with all Kconfig and Makefile changes appearing as
a final separate patch (so it's git-bisectable).
This is 17 KLOC of new code. You really want to make it easy to review
if you're serious about getting it merged.
