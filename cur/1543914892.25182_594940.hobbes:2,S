The 16MB is the size of a hugepage, the size of interest as far as I am
concerned. Your idea makes sense for large block support, but much less
for huge pages because you are incurring a cost in the general case for
something that may not be used.
There is nothing to say that both can't be done. Raise the size of
order-0 for large block support and continue trying to group the block
to make hugepage allocations likely succeed during the lifetime of the
system.

At the risk of repeating, your approach will be adding a new and
significant dimension to the internal fragmentation problem where a
kernel allocation may fail because the larger order-0 pages are all
being pinned by userspace pages.

It improves the probabilty of hugepage allocations working because the
blocks with slab pages can be targetted and cleared if necessary.

That suggestion was aimed at the large block support more than
hugepages. It helps large blocks because we'll be allocating and freeing
as more or less the same size. It certainly is easier to set
slub_min_order to the same size as what is needed for large blocks in
the system than introducing the necessary mechanics to allocate
pagetable pages and userspace pages from slab.

I'm not sure what you are getting at here. I think it would make more
sense if you said "when you read /proc/buddyinfo, you know the order-0
pages are really free for use with large blocks" with your approach.

As the kernel pages are all getting grouped together, there are fewer TLB
entries needed to address the kernels working set so there is a general
improvement although how much is workload
All this aside, there is nothing mutually exclusive with what you are proposing
and what grouping pages by mobility does. Your stuff can exist even if grouping
pages by mobility is in place. In fact, it'll help us by giving an important
comparison point as grouping pages by mobility can be trivially disabled with
a one-liner for the purposes of testing. If your approach is brought to being
a general solution that also helps hugepage allocation, then we can revisit
grouping pages by mobility by comparing kernels with it enabled and without.
