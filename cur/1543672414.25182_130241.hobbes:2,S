To reproduce the problem:
- - mount some nfs from a server in your lan.
- - Open an app, that uses the mounted fs. I've simply opened a
  konqueror-window for the directory where the nfs is mounted.
- - shut down or crash the server or just pull the network-cable.
- - Now the konqueror-process is nonkillable in D state. There's no
  chance to kill it.
I've tried it with all firewalls disabled, but the problem resists.

@linux-kernel-mailing-list: I've posted a thread to nfs-mailing list with
the same topic as in lkml. IMHO this is the better list for this problem. :)
