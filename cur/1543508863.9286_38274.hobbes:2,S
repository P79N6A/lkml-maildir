I'm not sure if I understand this right. Once a packet leaves the TCP
layer and it can not be passed to the ethernet hardware immediately, the
packet is not buffered, it is discareded?! Is that right? Why can it not
stay in some sk_buff list? When there is no more system memory
available, then the send system call will block and therefore there
should be always enaugh memory to buffer the packet for a wile.
