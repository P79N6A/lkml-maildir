Better would be to turn it into a per-architecture function.  On PA-RISC,
we can set a bit in the CPU to make it trap on transitions to userspace
and having a set_resched() function which just sets the need_resched
flag on x86 but sets the L bit on PA-RISC would mean that we could avoid
checking the flag.  Maybe this is a 2.5 thing though.
