Subject: [PATCH] softcursor.c: avoid unaligned accesses
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Franck Bui-Huu <fbuihuu@gmail.com>
This patch fixes some possible unaligned accesses when accessing
fields of 'image' pointer. Indeed this pointer was obtained by
allocating a block of memory that embeds a temporary array plus an
image structure. The temporary buffer was located at the start of the
allocated block and depending on its size, the image structure which
comes right after can be unaligned.
For example when using mini fonts (4x6) (cursor's width is 4 and its
height is 6) the temporary buf size is 6 bytes.
Therefore this patch moves the image structure to the start of the
block and moves the temporary buffer right after. It makes 'image'
pointer always aligned and since the tempo buf is a buffer of char,
it's always correctly aligned as well.
It also fixes the file header alignement.
