Domen Puncer's change to support "MPC5200 low power mode" (in
powerpc-git, which is in Linus's tree now) adds new code calling
mpc52xx_pm_prepare and _finish with suspend_state_t as an argument,
while Rafael Wysocki's pm-rework-struct-platform_suspend_ops.patch
converts those to take no arguments.  So the build fails:
arch/powerpc/platforms/52xx/mpc52xx_pm.c:61: error: conflicting types
for ‘mpc52xx_pm_prepare’
include/asm/mpc52xx.h:270: error: previous declaration of
‘mpc52xx_pm_prepare’ was here
arch/powerpc/platforms/52xx/mpc52xx_pm.c:167: error: conflicting types
for ‘mpc52xx_pm_finish’
include/asm/mpc52xx.h:272: error: previous declaration of
‘mpc52xx_pm_finish’ was here
Sorting this out is beyond my abilities; I don't know how to deal with
stuff like this (in arch/powerpc/platforms/52xx/lite5200_pm.c):
static int lite5200_pm_prepare(suspend_state_t state)
{
	/* deep sleep? let mpc52xx code handle that */
	if (state == PM_SUSPEND_STANDBY)
	       return mpc52xx_pm_prepare(state);
