It would be best to make this change.  minix, ext2 and ext3 do set ctime,
so it is "the Linux standard".
btw, this code:
      old_dir->i_ctime = old_dir->i_mtime = CURRENT_TIME;
      new_dir->i_ctime = new_dir->i_mtime = CURRENT_TIME;
      old_inode->i_ctime = CURRENT_TIME;
should avoid evaluating CURRENT_TIME three times: is has some computational
cost and if an interrupt happens at the wrong time you end up with
differing times in the inode(s).
