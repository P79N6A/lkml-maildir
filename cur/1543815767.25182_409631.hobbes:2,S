FYI, the grant table support is also used by non-x86 Xen architectures
(currently ia64 and soon ppc) so grant table files (along with event
channel files and some others) will eventually need to move out
of mach-xen.  The files are currently in drivers/xen/core in the Xen
tree, which is not really a good place either.  Suggestions?
