Hello,
I was looking for something like tmpfs, but with additional feature - 
that all the files in that file system would be compressed.
I think it could be nice for one's RAM, especially in embedded 
devices/diskless stations, at a little expense of efficiency.
Is there such a feature in 2.4 kernel yet, and, if not, where should I 
look for it?
There is e2compr module on 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/e2compr/,
 but 
I'm not sure if it can be easily applied to 2.4.22 kernel (seems like 
it's for 2.4.17 kernels only).
Regards,
Tomasz Chmielewski
