thanks to lunch with ess engineers and the hospitality of Hack Central, we
now have a partially working OSS driver for the ESS Maestro family of
chips.
caveat:  it only half works.
but the half that works gets you 16bit stereo output untill the buffers
get a bit out of sync or the thing leaks your machine to death.  at least,
on my maestro 2 it does.

If you're brave, please give it a try and let me know how it does on your
hardware.  I'm especially curious to find out what ac97s actually work,
and wether or not anyone out there has a maestro with a pt101 on.  
alsa dudes, feel free to drop me some mail and I'll happily chat you
through the gotchas in the hardware.  I don't have time now to wrap my wee
noggin around the highly complex alsa architecture.
