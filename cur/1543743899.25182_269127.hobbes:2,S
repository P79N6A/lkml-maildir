Yes.
So now I'd like to know _where_ the culprit is, since it turned out to be 
not the ALSA code.

Sounds like something else changed, and likely the ALSA _and_ the OSS 
driver both broke. Which is not all that unlikely, since I suspect they 
share a lot of history.

Not your fault. Think of this as a learning experience ;)
Anyway, now that the _other_ driver also oopses, and with a very similar 
oops too, so it looks like they both depended on some undocumented (or 
changed) detail in the PCI layer. Next step would be to see if the thing 
that breaks is this merge:
	ChangeSet@1.2463, 2004-11-04 17:07:16-08:00, torvalds@ppc970.osdl.org
	  Merge bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/driver-2.6
	  into ppc970.osdl.org:/home/torvalds/v2.6/linux
which merges Greg's PCI/driver model changes.
It's all the same steps you took with the ALSA merge, you're a
professional by now ;)
Greg, have you followed this thread?

Hey, sound is important. And especially if you somehow found something 
non-sound that just broke sound by mistake, all the more important to fix 
it.
