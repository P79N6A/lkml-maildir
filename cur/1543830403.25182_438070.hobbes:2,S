/* Heh, heh */
So what do I need to replace cli/sti with?
Oh btw:
(linux-2.6.17)
21:05 shanghai:../drivers/isdn > grep cli'()'  -lr .
./hardware/avm/t1isa.c
./hysdn/boardergo.c
./hysdn/hysdn_proclog.c
./hysdn/hysdn_sched.c
./isdnloop/isdnloop.c
There does not really seem to be a lot of places (yes, isdnloop is full of 
it) to change. Especially HISAX has no cli/stis anymore as it seems, 
which, among AVM stuff, is commonly in use. I am running this one:
  00:0a.0 Network controller: Tiger Jet Network Inc. Tiger3XX Modem/ISDN 
  interface (PCI, CONFIG_HISAX_NETJET)
previously I had a Teledat 100 (ISA, CONFIG_HISAX_SEDLBAUER) but had to 
replace that when I got a new motherboard with no ISA slots.
Have a nice day,
Jan Engelhardt
