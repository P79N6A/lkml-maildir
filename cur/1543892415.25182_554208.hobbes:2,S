Change request 85bd2fddd68e757da8e1af98f857f61a3c9ce647 introduced
section-mismatch checking for vmlinux, which caused all these warnings
to become visible.
It looks as if gcc can create references from .sdata to .init.sdata
depending on what optimisations it chooses to do.  Ideally we could
teach gcc to put its constants in the same section they reference.
But I'm no gcc guru.  The alternative is to get modpost to ignore such
references, at the cost of perhaps missing a real problem somewhere.
