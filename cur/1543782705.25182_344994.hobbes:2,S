Hmmm, I think you're trying to burn all the steps to programming...
First, your program needs some includes, otherwise it will never
know what struct thread_info and task_struct are made of.
Second, those are kernel structures and functions. There's no where you
can call them from userland.
You should really start from the ground with easier programs to
familiarize with C first.
