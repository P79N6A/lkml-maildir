Your system should have a way of doing this in a callout during the ifup
and ifdown scripts.  Under Fedora, ifup calls ifup-post, which calls
/sbin/ifup-local - you could add your routes there.
More importantly, routes are different from iptables.  At worst, an iptable
rule has a dangling '-i ethX' match that will fail if the interface is down,
but that's a harmless because the packet isn't from that interface.
On the other hand, what is the kernel supposed to do with a route that
points to a down'ed ethX after you've done the ifdown, but before you've
done the ifup?  It may as well clear routes to the down'ed interface....
