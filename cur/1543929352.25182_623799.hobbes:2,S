We need to hold onto inode_lock while walking sb->s_inodes.  Otherwise the
inode which we're currently looking at could get removed from i_sb_list and
bad things will happen (drop_pagecache_sb will go infinite, or will oops, I
guess).
drop_caches is bad this way - it has a couple of ranking errors.  A
suitable fix would be to remove the drop_caches feature, but it seems to be
fairly popular as a developer thing.  The approach thus far has been "yeah,
sorry about that, but drop_caches is only for development and it is
root-only anyway".
We could fix this particular issue by changing JBD to run
mark_inode_dirty() outside list_lock (which would be a good change
independent of the drop_caches issue) but other problems with drop_caches
will remain.
One way to fix jbd (and jbd2) would be:
static void __journal_temp_unlink_buffer(struct journal_head *jh,
					struct buffer_head **bh_to_dirty)
{
	*bh_to_dirty = NULL;
	...
	if (test_clear_buffer_jbddirty(bh))
		*bh_to_dirty = bh;
}
{
	struct buffer_head *bh_to_dirty;	/* probably needs uninitialized_var() */
	...
	__journal_temp_unlink_buffer(jh, &bh_to_dirty);
	...
	jbd_mark_buffer_dirty(bh_to_dirty);
	brelse(bh_to_dirty);
	...
}
static inline void jbd_mark_buffer_dirty(struct buffer_head *bh)
{
	if (bh)
		mark_buffer_dirty(bh);
}
