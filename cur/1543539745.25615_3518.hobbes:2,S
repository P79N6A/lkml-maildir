If someone's broken into the system, compromised root access, and is
really intent on killing the hardware (and knowledgeable about how to do
it), the EASY way would probably be to have a program that sends the
appropriate commands under DOS (no OS between you and hardware), make a
bootable DOS disk image, copy it to /dev/hda1 (or whatever you boot to,
run lilo if necessary to twiddle booting to the image), and reboot the
system with the sucker autoexecing itself.
At that point, Linux is out of the loop, and there's NOTHING you can do
in the kernel to make that unworkable without totally crippling your
system anyway.  You can't even get fancy about intercepting and parsing
port commands.  The OS isn't running anymore.
I reality, what does this mean?  Simply formattting your drive could
easily cost thousands of dollars in lost time and productivity if you DO
have good backups.  Killing a $200 IDE drive is basically adding insult
to injury.  Any corner computer store can have you back in business in
an hour, hardware-wise.  It's commodity stuff.  Paying your employees to
reinstall and reconfigure the system just might cost more than the new
hardware...
Software destroyable hardware isn't something more software can
protect.  It's like the old Microsoft strategy of "piling on more code
until the system becomes stable and efficient".  It just doesn't work
that way.
