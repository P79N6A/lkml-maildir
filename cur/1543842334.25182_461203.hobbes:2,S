hm, could you take a look at why that difference happens? Do you make 
use of __do_IRQ()? Do you make use of all the various flow handlers that 
are offered in handle.c? Could you #ifdef out all the functions that are 
unused? The kernel build process doesnt remove them and i havent (yet) 
put them into a library.
Could you please send us the patch that genirq-ifies FRV?

To have shared code between architectures? To make generic API updates 
easier for all of us? To have less cruft in interrupt.h? To not having 
to add last-minute patches to v2.6.18 because some arch defines its own 
IRQ prototypes and a difficult generic feature like irqtrace breaks? To 
get new IRQ subsystem features for free like preemptible irqs, irqpoll 
or SHIRQ debugging?
the same "why should we share code" argument could be made for the VFS 
too. Sharing code has a (small) price most of the time, but it's also 
very much worth it. I think the size increases you are seeing are 
artificial and most of it is not caused by the indirections. If they 
were caused by the indirections i'd probably agree with you.
if your argument were true every arch should run its whole Linux kernel 
in arch/frv, with zero sharing with anyone else. There's always a lot of 
'unnecessary' stuff all around the kernel that is just a hindrance for 
FRV. In reality what makes us stronger is to work together. I dont for a 
minute say that we should overdo code sharing - if it's not possible 
then it must not be forced, but just the pure fact of "more 
indirections" or "what does this bring me _now_" isnt a good enough 
reason i believe - it simply makes _future_ changes easier.
