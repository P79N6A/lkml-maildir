i wasn't trying to suggest it was hard to code or understand.  my question
is how to do this efficiently.  has anyone compared the performance of
this model with the performance of the same application implemented
using NT's completion ports?
every Unix model i've seen that uses the "single thread waits for event
and wakes up worker threads" has suffered from a variety of problems that
can cripple its performance, like:
how does the event waiter thread determine whether there is a
suitable/idle worker thread to awaken?

agreed!  any ideas?
