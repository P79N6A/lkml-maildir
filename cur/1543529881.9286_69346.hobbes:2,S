An interrupt on another process can wake up a task and set
current->need_resched on this processor.

Waking up another task may set current->need_resched.  But it can't
actually reschedule until reaching the spin_unlock_irqsave.  At that
point or some low-latency time later, you need to reschedule to get low
latency.
