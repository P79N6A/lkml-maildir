A.,
   I have the IWILL KA266 motherboard (that I got from micropro.com...)
and it works just fine with the 2.4.x kernels.
   At home, however, I have a motherboard with the AMD760 chipset
(an FIC AD11, I wish slightly that I'd gotten the DFI motherboard) that
also works with the 2.4.x kernels - and it is far better at taking
advantage of DDR memory for number crunching applications (both from
my own benchmarks (20% better), and from www.tomshardware.com.  For
most things, however, it has very similar performance as the IWILL.  If
at all possible, it is worth getting an AMD chipset to go with the
DDR memory.  But micropro doesn't carry them...you might call them and
ask if they could order it.
   Both of these motherboards are around $100-125 - I have nothing
fancy on these, however.
B.D.
