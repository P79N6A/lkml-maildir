Subject: DMA support in cs5530 IDE driver?

Can anyone report success or failure with enabling DMA for
the CS5530 IDE driver? I can get my system to crash or at
least hang pretty reliably by using hdparm to turn on DMA
while reading an MPEG-2 movie from my hard disk drive.
The hard disk drive is the only rotating drive on the 
system.
Hardware: GCT Allwell set top box 
CPU: National Geode 266MHz GXM  
IDE controller: CS5530 Geode companion chip
Linux: 2.4.3
Disk: IBM Deskstar, 46.1 GByte
Any comments or suggestions appreciated
Thanks,
Michael
