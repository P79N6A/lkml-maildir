I've not run updatedb in years, so I have no idea what it does to a
modern kernel. It used to be an unholy terror of slab fragmentation
and displacing user memory. The case of streaming kernel metadata IO
is probably not quite as easy as streaming file IO.

The policy people need to clean this up once and for all at some point.
clameter's targeted reclaim bits for slub look like a plausible tactic,
but are by no means comprehensive. Things need to attempt to eat their
own tails before eating everyone else alive. Maybe we need to take hits
on things such as badari's dd's to resolve the pathologies.
