No.  ACPI is the preferred method in order to *get configuration*
for cpu frequency and voltage scaling, but it's up to a
specific processor driver to control frequency (actually I'm
simplifying things since it's possible to control frequency
from ACPI only, but only in certain situation).
Throttling is another method to frequency control by throttling
the processor (and ACPI is then preferred for both configuration
and controlling how to throttle the processor), but there is
no voltage scaling at all as for frequency and voltage scaling.
Those far it's up to the OP to activate ACPI even if he do not trust
ACPI.  It's the only way to get configuration from BIOS if he do not
want to hardcode a configuration in the speedstep-centrino driver.
