I've seen this too.  It's irritating to have to reboot my colo server
twice a week; it's like I'm using NT or something.  :-(

My observed rate is more like one per minute, with occasional faster
bursts.  I haven't managed to correlate any particular activity to the
bursts.
To summarize what we know so far:
  * The leak affects 2.2.13 and 2.2.14, at least.
  * The leak occurs when the high-activity filesystem is either ext2
    or reiserfs, so it's probably in the fs-independent code.
  * The leak rate varies depending on system activity.
Anything else?
