It is available for KVM compilation, not for KVM use.
In fact smp_ops is not available for KVM use, so as
smp_call_function_mask() is smp_ops.smp_call_function_mask() we can say it
is not available...
My first reflex was to export smp_ops, but as it seems it is an internal
and hidden variable, it appears I should export smp_call_function_mask()
instead.
