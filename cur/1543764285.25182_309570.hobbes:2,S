The stuff we discussed.
Plus, I'm still quite unsettled about the whole object lifecycle
management, refcounting and locking in there.  The fact that the code is
littered with peculiar barriers says "something weird is happening here",
and it remains unobvious to me why such a very common kernel pattern was
implemented in such an unusual manner.
So.  I'd like to see the whole thing reexplained and resubmitted so we can
think about it all again.

Guillaume was referring to "fork connector", not to "connector".
