Check on your /boot/grub.config.  The above error message is typically 
seen when the root= parameter points to a symbolic disk label instead of a 
specific disk such as /dev/hda1.  I'm not sure what the procedure for 
updating where the label points (possibly a mkinitrd) because I normally 
change the grub.conf to point to a specific disk.
