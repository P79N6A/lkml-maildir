   Playing around with the Mesa3D demos last night I had 3 similar
lockups.  The system is a PII-400 128MB RAM, 256MB swap on vanilla 2.4.3
(also did this on 2.4.2-ac18 as it happens).  There's:
	a) A similar lockup to described above, I caught my 'resetv2'
	(small util to just initialise a voodoo2 then exit cleanly, or
	so I thought) chewing up VM like it was going out of fashion.
	Shortly thereafter solid lockup, LEDs not working etc, although
	I think I forgot to try Alt-SysRq+R that time to see if the
	keyboard would come back to life.
	b) Running a Mesa3D demo that uses threads was fine with 3 or 5,
	try it with 10, instant lockup, no magic sysrq, had to hit the
	reset button.  So I'd assume some other issue with threads in
	2.4.3/2.4.2-ac18
