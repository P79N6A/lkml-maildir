I suspect we could do with a Documentation/syscalls.txt collecting such
rules from various architectures.
We could _also_ do with a way to warn about unimplemented syscalls on
any given architecture. I'm thinking about something along the lines of
a kernel/syscalls.c containing nothing but...
	#include <asm/unistd.h>
	#ifndef __NR_sys_foo
	#warning The sys_foo system call is not implemented on this architecture
	#endif
Ideally, that wants to be auto-generated from the union of all
<asm-*/unistd.h> files, but in practice I suspect we could do it just
from <asm-i386/unistd.h>. Even I usually manage to add new syscalls on
i386 after I've done PowerPC.
