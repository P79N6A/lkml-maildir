OK. I noticed some minor conflicts with 2.6.29-rc1 but I'll have a look
at linux-next as well. IIRC, is the -mm tree based on top of linux-next?

I would feel a bit more comfortable if kmemleak lived for (at least) a
release cycle in the -mm tree so that it may get wider testing. As I
said, I mainly tested it on ARM.
If you are OK with this, I'll update the branch and make sure there are
as few conflicts as possible (the alternative is patches by e-mail and
based on top of linux-next).
