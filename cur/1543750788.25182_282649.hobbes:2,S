Instead of adding another ioctl, wouldn't an xattr be more appropriate?
For instance, system.fatattrs containing a text representation of the
attribute bits.
i.e. 
	a = archive
	d = directory
	h = hidden
	r = read only
	s = system
	v = volume
	6 = unused bit 6
	7 = unused bit 7
and
bash-3.00$ getfattr -n system.fatattrs dosfile.txt
# file: dosfile.txt
system.fatattrs="ar"
bash-3.00$
