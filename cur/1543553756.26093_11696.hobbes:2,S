hi,
As you've suggested, you'd be better off not using the load
average but rather some other measure (or combination of
measures) to figure out when you have enough spare cycles or
bandwidth.
The "pmie" tool might be useful to you - here's a contrived
example I just knocked up (instead of a "print" you'd want
to run your program via the "shell" keyword) with an
occassional artificial load in the background.
kernel.all.cpu.idle is aggregate idle time across all cpus.
pmie converts it to a rate (#idle milliseconds / 8 seconds)
so it will always have a value between 0 (no idle time) and
1 (lots of idle time).
$ pmie -t 8sec -v
( kernel.all.cpu.idle > 0.5 ) -> print "start a new job";
^D

pmie is one of the gpl'd pcp tools which you can get from
the sgi oss site... hope its useful to you.  mailto the
pcp list if you need any more info.
cheers.
