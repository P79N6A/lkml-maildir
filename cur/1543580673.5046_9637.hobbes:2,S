Go measure the cost of a distant cache miss, then complain about having
everything in one structure.  Also, 1 kiobuf maps 16-128 times as much
data as a single buffer head.

This is a Really Bad Idea.  Having semantics depend on a subtle flag
determined by a caller is a sure way to

Keep in mind that using distant memory allocations for kio_data will incur
additional cache misses.  The atomic count is probably going to be widely
used; I see it being applicable to the network stack, block io layers and
others.  Also, how is information about io completion status passed back
to the caller?  That information is required across layers so that io can
be properly aborted or proceed with the partial amount of io.  Add those
back in and we're right back to the original kiobuf structure.
