You either stick with SuSE 9.3 forever, or you
*try* something newer to see if it works,
or you pay the manufacturer to certify something newer.
This problem isn't linux specific - hardware vendors tend
to support software that is current at time of sale, then
the world moves on without them.  This happens
for all operating systems.

Users of closed-source drivers get their support from
the closed-source vendor - not from the kernel developers.
It is that simple.
Again - this is how all operating systems works.
If you have closed windows 3.1 drivers, then microsoft do
*not* make sure they work with vista either - unless
the device is extremely mainstream.  For all other devices,
the device manufacturer have to provide updated drivers.
If your vendor don't want to support you anymore, try getting
the source.
