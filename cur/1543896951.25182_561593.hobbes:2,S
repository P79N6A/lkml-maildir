Probably "XScale 270" is not the best word combination for this,
the exact processor name is PXA270 (formerly Intel, now Marvell).

Assuming the mainline kernel already includes support for your machine,
1. get the latest stable Linux kernel
2. compile the kernel:
    make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=<your_crosscompiler_prefix> 
<your_machine_name>_defconfig
    make <kernel_image_name>
    For example, to compile the kernel for Mainstone platform
    with blob flashed, do the following:
   
    make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux- mainstone_defconfig
    make zImage
3. boot the image as appropriate for your bootloader
