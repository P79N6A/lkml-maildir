Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.21 /proc/<pid>/cmdline overflow
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/6/16/121

Currently when a process has a command line that is more than 4k long, 
the internal buffer does not end up being null terminated and the kernel 
assumes that the process has called setproctitle.  The net effect is 
that for processes with >4k command lines, the commnad line available 
via proc is terminated after argv[0].
This patch terminates >4k command lines with ... at the 4k mark.
It has been only minimal tested in 2.4.21, but has been used quite a bit 
in 2.4.18.
