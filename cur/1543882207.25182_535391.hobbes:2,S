No, you need to use the *proper* type as an argument, and assuming that 
type has the same representation in both 32-bit and 64-bit world, the 
numbers will automatically match.
Using "void *" is totally bogus. It's supposed to be the actual argument 
you pass in, not the pointer to it. If your argument doesn't have a 
"struct xyz" kind of format, then you could use "int" (or u32 or 
something: but realistically int is 32-bit for the forseeable future), but 
it's always wrong to pass in "void *" or "unsigned long", since either of 
those are just a sign of the interface being either (a) misunderstood or 
(b) broken.
