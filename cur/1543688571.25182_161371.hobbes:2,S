Hi!
acpi/sleep needs to stay. It is published interface, being used in
2.4.X and 2.6.0-test3. That makes it wrong to change it in
2.6.0-test4. [I've seen two different people trying to use
/proc/acpi/sleep in last week, *in person*.]
Also your new /sys/power/state is bogus. You invented new abstraction,
alas that abstraction is harmfull. User needs to know if he is doing
S4BIOS or swsusp: in first case he needs to set up special partition,
in second case he needs to pass resume= flag.
