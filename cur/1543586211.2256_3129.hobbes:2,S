Only for trusted binaries. (extreme paranoia now).

Compilers should work normally, the link phase is what would generate
the checksums, though if each object file contained a checksum for the
segment then the interpreters/dynamic loaders would have the choice.
The only applications I see as really needing to check such signatures
are those using PAM. These should do it anyway. The dynamic linking programs
should do so only if they are configured to do so.

User eduation is a reasonable substitute as long as they can be directed
to follow the rules.
