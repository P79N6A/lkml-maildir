The check can not be removed. The reason why it was added is still the
same. 
It has nothing to do with a state machine. It's a simple SMP locking
issue.
softirq runs on CPU0
base->lock()
remove_timer(timer);
base->unlock()
			signal of previous expiry is delivered on CPU1
			timer is reqeued.
requeue = timer->fn();
base->lock()
if (requeue)
	enqueue_timer(timer)
--> OOPS
We can not wait in the signal delivery path until the callback has been
executed, as we hold the posix-timer->lock and this would deadlock
timer->fn().
