That's wrong:
cisco-switch(config)#cdp ?
  advertise-v2  CDP sends version-2 advertisements
  holdtime      Specify the holdtime (in sec) to be sent in packets
  timer         Specify the rate at which CDP packets are sent (in sec)
  run
it can be enabled/disables on a per interface base.
There are also some different output possibilitites on cisco:
sh cdp
and:
sh cdp run
sh cdp timer
sh cdp traffic
and (no the interesting parts within here):
sh cdp neigh <detail>
sh cdp entry <*> <WORD>
sh cdp interface ..

portability ? linux is not the only OS in world. Think about running
on *BSD, Solaris, AIX, HPUX, ...
