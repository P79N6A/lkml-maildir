Hi, this is just a reminder that discussion is now starting on the 2007
ksummit discuss list, and that I will be turning off the 2006 discuss
list shortly after sending out this note.  Please direct all comments
about the Kernel Summit to the 2007 ksummit discussion list.
If you missed last week's announcement, the list submission address and
subscription URL can be found by executing the following perl script.
Not that I expect this will keep the spammers out, but maybe it will
slow them down a little...
#!/usr/bin/perl
$at="@";
$AD=(gmtime(time))[5]+1900;
print "ksummit-" . $AD . "-discuss" . $at . "thunk.org\n";
print "
http://thunk.org/mailman/listinfo/ksummit-"
 . $AD . "-discuss\n";
