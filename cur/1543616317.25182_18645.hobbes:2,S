hear hear!
The akpm patch is achieving a MUCH better latency than pure -preempt,
and only has 40 
or so coded preemption points instead of a few hundred (eg every
spin_unlock).... 
and if with 40 we can get <= 1ms then everybody will be happy; if you
want, say, 50 usec
latency instead you need RTLinux anyway. With 1ms _worst case_ latency
the "mean" latency 
is obviously also very good.......
