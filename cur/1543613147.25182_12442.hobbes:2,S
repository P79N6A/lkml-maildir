hi
I have this pc with a promise udma133 tx2 controller, having one 120G
drive per channel. I'm benchmarking this, using some 50 'dd if=file[1..50]
of=/dev/null' to simuate my application. This will work for a few seconds,
giving me pretty good i/o speed, but then all the processes go defunct and
stay like that some minutes (i really don't know how long).
I tried to do the bechmark with the individual drives, and no problem
there...
Anyone have a clue?
Configuration:
- Promise 133 TX2 (20269 manually patched in. Just made som defines to
  alias it to the 20268)
- 2 WD1200BB drives (hde and hdg)
/etc/raidtab:
raiddev /dev/md0
	raid-level              0
	nr-raid-disks           2
	persistent-superblock   0
	chunk-size              4096
	device                  /dev/hde
	raid-disk               0
	device                  /dev/hdg
	raid-disk               1
