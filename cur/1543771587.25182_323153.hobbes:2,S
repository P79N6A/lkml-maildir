The oops is because we normally don't even assign but->resource[2] for the 
root bridge. The following seems to fix the oops, but it makes a normal PC 
totally unbootable, so that doesn't help you. I didn't have a serial 
console hooked up, so I didn't get the logs. Somebody who has, and enables 
CONFIG_PCI_DEBUG, can you send me the output?
