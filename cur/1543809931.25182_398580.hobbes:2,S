I'm sorry if I didn't make that clear. Some developers are saying that 
the application shouldn't be finding devices because udev does that so 
it doesn't matter that doing device location in the application is 
complex and poorly defined because udev does it for you. I was making 
the point that in the most common distributions (Fedora and SuSE) 
pluggable burners don't get proper entries in /dev to make cdrecord 
work. Based on a single report sent directly to me that seems to be the 
case in ubuntu as well, but I haven't personally tried it.
I was refuting the claim that applications no longer need to find their 
own devices; in many cases they do.
Burning using the USB devices works fine if the right devices are found 
and created.
