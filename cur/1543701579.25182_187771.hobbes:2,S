Note that one reason I didn't much like the 64-bit versions is that not 
only are they bigger, they also encourage insanity. Ie you'd find SCSI 
people who want to try to encode device/controller/bus/target/lun info 
into the device number. 
We should resist any effort that makes the numbers "mean" something. They 
are random cookies. Not "unique identifiers", and not "addresses".
The unique identifiers you get from things like udev, using contents of
the device itself or user preferences etc. That's outside the scope of the
kernel. The addresses you get from /sys.
