Subject: Dead lock in kill_fasync() in 2.4.0-test2

kill_fasync() in ../fs/fcntl.c is called on interrupt and also from
non-interrupt code.  This causes the read_lock(&fasync_lock) to be (on
occasion) locked by the same processor.  
Has this been fixed in later versions?
Here is the trace:

For some reason gdb doesn't print the following line (but note eip above
-1072334279=0xc0157a39):

This trace was obtained by putting debug code in the lock calls to check
for prior locks on lock and unlocked on unlocks.  The machine is a
simple pentium II UP.  The test load is from windows, in a shell window
run "ping -f add" where add is an up and nearby machine on the local
area net.  Then all you have to do is move the focus (by using the
mouse) to another shell window.  Fails very easily.
I would think that obtaining locks from interrupt code should be a
NO-NO.  Is this not so?  Or is the fact that is it a read lock a reason
to dismiss it?  But even read locks are on a machine basis, not an
interrupt basis....
