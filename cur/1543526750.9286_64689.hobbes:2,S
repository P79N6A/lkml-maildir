I know I should not touch POSIX semantics. 
But you did not understand me well. I wanted to keep allowed bits in
filesystem and keep special semantics of uid 0.

No. Because I would keep allowed set in filesystem. So if it is setuid
0 but allowed set is NET_BIND_LOW, I *know* that it will drop all but
NET_BIND_LOW. You see?

BTW you could also attach proofs that it will correctly drop
privileges (:-) or use elfcap trick. It actually provides lscap...

You are right that my approach will not give you ability to get away
with nonzero uid. That's the point where elfcap got ugly: if you
wanted it setuid smtp and forced NET_BIND_LOW, where do you put old
uid with my approach.

I'd like to see elfcap in kernel ;-). That gives verifiable way to
know that process drops its capabilities.

No. We still miss enforcible allowed set. I wanted to keep allowed set
but forget about forced. My idea brings something new (verifyable way
to see process drops rights). This idea is better than elfcap because
it also works for scripts (not big advantage). And it gets ugly with
raised but setuid to different users... So you are partly right...
