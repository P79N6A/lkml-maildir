Nope, that isn't design, that's reacting.

Hogwash ;)  Please see my post above where I point out 'evolution isn't 
random'.  Your genes have a plan, if only a vague one.  It goes something 
like this: "we'll allow random variations, but only along certain lines, 
within limits, and in certain combinations, and we'll try to stick to 
variations that haven't killed us in the past."
Sounds a lot like how Linus does things, huh?
I'm sure Linus does have quite considerable talent for design, but I haven't 
seen him execise it much.  Mostly he acts as a kind of goodness daemon, 
sitting in his little pinhole and letting what he considers 'good' stuff pass 
into the box.  There's no doubt about it, it's different from the way you 
like to develop, you and me both.  Equally clearly, it works pretty well.
