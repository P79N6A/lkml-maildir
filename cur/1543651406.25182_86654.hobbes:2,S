Are you sure? Isn't what Linus is saying is that he understands that some
problems can be solved using dumps, some from the oops message and some by
source code inspection and some by others means. But, he's not interested
in a timely resolution; he has a preference for solving the problems by
looking at the source and only that way. That's his preference: arguments
relating to timeliness and commercial considerations are of no interest to
him - simply because they argue for benefits in which he has no interest.
Because LKCD doesn't personally interest him he has declared that he will
not merge it; it' up to some trusted advocate.
So, for those of use who passionately care whether Linux has a system
dumping mechanism, we need to regroup, we need to decide the correct
strategy for gaining LKCD's inclusion into the kernel.  Many of the
arguments relate to timeliness and ultimately have a commercial benefit. I
suggest we actively campaign among the various distros who are interested
in selling Linus businesses and provide support. We also need to
concentrate on consolidating the various requirements of a system crash
dump - it's going to be much easier for everyone if there is a consensus on
system dumping technology.
First crucial question - are there any avenues still open for 2.5?
