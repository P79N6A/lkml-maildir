Which is why it's a good place to start.  If we didn't see huge
improvements here, there's no use in experimenting with this tactic
further.

I had a much longer reply at first as well, but this is only day 1 of
Jens' benchmark, and he had plans to test other workloads.  I'd like to
give him the chance to do that work before we think about merging the
patch.  It's a good starting point for the question "can we do better
