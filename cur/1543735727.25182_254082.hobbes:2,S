Okay, I'll resend after dealing with that. It looks obvious, but just
to cut down on noise and/or false starts I'll get it through a clean
ia32 boot before following up. It was runtime tested on x86-64, sparc64,
ia64, alpha, and ppc64 prior to posting, so it boggles my mind that a
bogon this obvious could have run that gauntlet undetected...
