Hi William,
If it ever gets that bad, email me and we'll find a way to create
hardware without those restrictions, and get it to people who want it.
If the hardware that comes out of industry won't let you hack, hey you
still have basic materials like SiO2 from the real world to make your
own.  Tough, but rewarding :)
It only gets _really_ bad when it becomes illegal to make your own
hardware :(
