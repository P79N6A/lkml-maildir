In normal configurations it shouldnt be. Both ext3 and reiserfs currently
have the problem that they need to replay the log to get a stable file 
system. Obviously you cant replay the log to disk if its read only, so they
replay the log to disk read/write then mount the fixed fs read only.
It breaks if your hardware has given up writing (certain disk fails) or if
you are running the swsuspend patch (serious disk corruption) but really
the swsusp patch interaction is the only problem one
