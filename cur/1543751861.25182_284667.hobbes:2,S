 According to Linus, using straight kernel headers for /usr/include
is obsolete for 10 (ten) years now. I do not agree, but kernel
developers do.
 There was few discussion on this topic. Here's one Linus post:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0007.3/0587.html
 Here you can find latest thread about fixing this issue:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/11/26/106
 Mainstream distributions use ,,sanitized'' version o kernel
headers - Fedora has own set, Debian has another,  LFS too. For rest and
for us, casual users, there are headers made as byproduct of PLD
Linux, which are used since december 2003 (before kernel 2.6 was
even released).
