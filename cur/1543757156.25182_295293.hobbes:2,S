Hello,
I saw the discussion between you and Andrew Morton in the LKML on serial
driver's problems.
I think the problem comes, as you said from the serail driver:
According to the tty_io.c file comments:
It should not call the flush of the tty buffer from within interrupt
handler in case of handling low_latency.
IMHO most drivers do that and are buggy.
(or may be I am buggy)
what do you think?
I was not in the lklm at tht time so I cannot answer in the thread, 
so I put you in CC.
I do not have the email address of Andrew Morton.
best regards,
Pierre Morel
