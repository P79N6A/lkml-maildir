Crippling a few KB of metadata in the ext{2,3} case probably wouldn't
fobar the filesystem...

The point is that it's quite hard to really fuck up ext{2,3} with only
some KB being written while it seems (due to the
fragile^Wsophisticated on-disk data structures) that it's just easy to
kill a reiser3 filesystem.
