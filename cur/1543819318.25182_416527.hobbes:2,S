Yeah, I thought about the paging latencies when it was first mentioned.
And this is something that's going to be very hard to know the impact,
because it will be different on every system.

OK, but as I mentioned that this is now more of a side project, so a
month of work is not really going to be a month of work ;)  I'll first
try to get something that just "works" and then post an RFC PATCH set,
to get more ideas.  Since obviously there's a lot of people out there
that know their systems much better than I do ;)
