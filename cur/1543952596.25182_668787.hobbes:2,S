Thanks, I reduced COUNT to 2500, otherwise it took ages on my slowly
machine :-) Also, I don't have jrocket, so I stuck with openjdk as that
is the official open source JRE (afaik).
Using the below patch, I get:
sched_features=319:
Average throughput = 65984 messages per second
Average throughput = 64568 messages per second
Average throughput = 66059 messages per second
sched_features=63:
Average throughput = 52536 messages per second
Average throughput = 53592 messages per second
Average throughput = 51705 messages per second
Which seems to suggest the current code does better for me.
(fwiw this is with compat_yield=0)
sched_features=319, sched_compat_yield=1:
Average throughput = 47669 messages per second
Average throughput = 47435 messages per second
Average throughput = 47120 messages per second
[ this is in stark contradiction to all these Java _needs_
  compat_yield=1 stories I keep hearing.. ]
This is on a single dual core opteron.
So given these numbers, I'm inclined to say openjdk is a better behaving
JRE than jrocket - but what do I know about these things :-)
