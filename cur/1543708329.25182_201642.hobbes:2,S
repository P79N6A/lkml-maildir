I observed a serious slowdown on non numa, non smt machines with kernbench and
the scheduler changes (posted results a week ago here:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=107719112225482&w=2 )
A summary of those results is half job load (-j4 on 8x):
2.6.3: Elapsed Time 231.274
2.6.3-mm1: Elapsed Time 273.688
The drop in reaim performance is possibly related.
