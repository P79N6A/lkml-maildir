Infact the patch was bogus (and the previous code was bogus too not only
by design). Here the _right_ fix (this time I didn't cared about other
no-linux things I have to do today and I taken the time to think about
it). I also removed the preshirnk mess that was not allowing an admin to
increase inode-max (to have a bigger inode caching beahvior) if preshirnk
was incidentally just 1.
Here the _right_ patch against 2.2.2-pre1 (2.2.1 clean make no
differences). This time I checked and I am pretty sure you'll be happy as
me ;).
I am not forwarding this to Linus because he asked me to go away and so I
don't want to hurt him further.
