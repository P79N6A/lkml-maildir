did i ever mention that i find rwlocks evil, inefficient and bug-prone, 
and that we should get rid of them? :-)
(Most rwlock users can be converted to straight spinlocks just fine, but 
there are a couple of places that rely on read-lock nesting. The 
hardest-to-fix offenders are nested rcu_read_locks() in the netfilter 
code. I gave up converting them to saner locking, PREEMPT_RCU works it 
around in the -rt tree, by not being rwlock based.)
