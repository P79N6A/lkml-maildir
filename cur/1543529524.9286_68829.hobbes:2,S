I'd disagree. The remove and attach technique is very very commonly used
by other applications in order to ensure the segment is deleted if a program
crashed - directly analogous to open/unlink/read.
Gimp wont be the only thing that breaks. So the old behaviour needs to work
at least for SYS5 IPC, what posix ipc does is another matter
