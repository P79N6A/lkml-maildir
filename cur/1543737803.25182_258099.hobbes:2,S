Yes, that _raw_read_trylock patch has fixed my zombie problem: since
2.6.9-rc2-mm1 my repeated kernel builds would hang after several hours,
with a zombie (usually cc1) on one cpu and its waiting parent (usually
gcc) on another, with the puzzle of why the parent had never got woken -
because do_wait's read_lock(&tasklist_lock) went ahead even while
exit_notify held the write lock.
