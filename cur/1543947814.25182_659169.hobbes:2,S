hm, interesting.
but unfortunately the cpuset have more than depend.(i.e. CONFIG_SMP)
To more bad thing, some embedded cpu have poor or no atomic instruction
support.
at that, turn on CONFIG_SMP become large performace regression ;)
I am not already embedded engineer.
thus, I might have made a mistake.
(BTW: I am large server engineer now)
but no thinking dependency is wrong, may be.
Pavel, what do you think it?
