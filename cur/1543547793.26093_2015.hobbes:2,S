Neil,
I think Linus knows this, and from what I've seen, it may break a ton of
shit.  I think folks need to let Linus know these issues.  NT and
NetWare both support variable length and offset sectors read/write
requests.  This fixed block size stuff is tough for non-Linux file
systems like NTFS and NWFS.
