I know about grope, but I didn't know about Nat's talk - thanks for the
pointer.  That's pretty much the same area, but its nice to be able to make to
work for already-linked programs too.
Certainly doing it in the linker means you can pack things into pages better,
whereas my approach only allows you to rearrange pages, and therefore only
helps the VM system but not the CPU cache hit rate.  The advantage is that you
need no special support at compile/link time, so you can do it to anything.
