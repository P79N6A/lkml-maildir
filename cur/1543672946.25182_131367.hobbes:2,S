Possibly, I can try backing out just that part.
To complicate matters, this is happening on 2 machines:
a server and a laptop.
I disabled USB on the laptop (2.5.69) and the problem
is still there :-(
I am confident about these results:
1. On the server, bk10 and earlier works, bk11 and later breaks.
2. On the server, bk11 with USB breaks, bk11 without USB works.
3. On the laptop, 2.5.68 and earlier works, 2.5.69 breaks
I need to test the laptop with the bk10/bk11 sets to
see if this follows the results on the server.
Maybe disabling/enabling USB is just triggering something else
in the configuration file.
I'm leaving for the weekend now, and will try
to get back to this on Monday.
