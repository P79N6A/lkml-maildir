Ok, that's just being mean, cut it out right now if you ever want my
help again.
I'll gladly accept patches for this document that is in the kernel tree
now if you want to send them.  But criticizing the grammer of a document
with statements like this one gets you no where and is damm rude.
I suggest you start this thread over if you want my feedback, I'm not
going to respond anymore to this one.
