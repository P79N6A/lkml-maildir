Am I missing something here? If you have ro and rw data in a cache line:
1r  0w  if you don't modify the data
1r  1w  if you do
if you have ro and rw in separate cache lines:
2r  0w  if you don't modify the data
2r  1w  if you do
It would seem that you always have at least one read, and if you modify
the data at least one write, wherein is the saving?
Note: I am not disagreeing with you, I just can't follow how this is a
win in any case.
