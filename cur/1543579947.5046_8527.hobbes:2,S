It was posted on linux-kernel - I don't save the dang things because I
have too much in my "archives" as is ;)

Well, IF they are sleeping (and thus, if the wake_up_nr() will trigger on
them), they _will_ use a request. I don't think we have to worry about
that. At most we will wake up "too many" - we'll wake up processes even
though they end up not being able to get a request anyway because somebody
else got to it first. And that's ok. It's the "wake up too few" that
causes trouble, and I think that will be fixed by my suggestion.
Now, I'd worred if somebody wants several requests at the same time, and
doesn't feed them to the IO layer until it has gotten all of them. In that
case, you can get starvation with many people having "reserved" their
requests, and there not be enough free requests around to actually ever
wake anybody up again. But the regular IO paths do not do this: they will
all allocate a request and just submit it immediately, no "reservation".
(Obviously, _submitting_ the request doesn't mean that we'd actually start
processing it, but if somebody ends up waiting for requests they'll do the
unplug that does start it all going, so effectively we can think of it as
a logical "start this request now" thing even if it gets delayed in order
to coalesce IO).
