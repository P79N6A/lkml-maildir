	It sounds like you haven't compiled the drivers required to access your
root partition into the kernel.  If your root partition on an IDE drive,
the kernel _must_ have the IDE drivers in the kernel, that is, they
_cannot_ be modules.  Same applies to SCSI.  If you have the proper
drivers installed in the kernel, and you're still having trouble, check
your lilo config (/etc/lilo.conf) to make sure you have the correct root
device set.  If you don't use lilo, then try using `rdev` which sets the
image root device.  man rdev.
	Hope it helps,
