What if one of the workloads on the queue has another call to
flush_scheduled_work()? (which again finds itself calling another
instance, ...)
This fix doesn't really resolve the deadlock issue. It just reduces the
possibilities of it having any consequences...
Could you please at least include a dump_stack() before the call to
run_workqueue()) so that we can catch the bug in the act, and attempt to
fix it.
Cheers,
