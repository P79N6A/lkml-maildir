I thought you said hardware to test wasn't necessary?
It's not particularly hard to find drivers that need work -- just
looking at everything protected by CONFIG_BROKEN would find plenty of
things to jump on.  Or do "git grep 'cli(' drivers/".

A quick web search finds

 but I don't see
any signs that anyone plans to submit it upstream.

I disagree -- Linux today gets drivers not just from volunteers
writing drivers from specs, but also from vendors writing drivers and
volunteers writing drivers via reverse engineering.  And many of those
drivers don't work on every platform and aren't supported by
enterprise distros.  And when the community loses interest, drivers
are left to bitrot.
Hardware specs help.  They help a lot.  But they're neither necessary
nor sufficient for getting a high-quality Linux driver written.  And
they definitely don't guarantee continuing maintenance.
