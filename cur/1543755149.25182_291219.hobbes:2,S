I set the PCI card to primary, and kept the AGP card. Then I booted up
2.6.9-rc3 which normally crashes hard when X starts.  
But now X came up just fine on the radeon!  The log indicates
no problems with drm either, I did not get a "pci oom".
I didn't actually test with glxgears, but drm came up according
to the logs.
I did not change the X setup, so the pci card was initialized by
int10 although that wasn't necessary this time.
I have not yet tested wether the AGP card works in this configuration, my
user was impatient so I had to restore a known working configuration.
