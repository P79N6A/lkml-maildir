There's a missing piece of behavior here that's probably fatal.
Namely, the next time the CS descriptor is loaded, even with the same
value, the high bits are lost. So, for example, if you're running BIOS
out of ROM, decompressing it into the top of 20-bit address space,
then long jumping to your uncompressed code, you don't want to find
yourself back in ROM.
Perhaps there's a trick that can be played with loading the descriptor
into CS and then clearing the descriptor table without flushing, but it
sounds rather dubious..
