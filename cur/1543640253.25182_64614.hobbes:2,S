Well, as I implied, Alan seems to be not completely unwilling to work on 
it, and unlike me he _can_ interact with Andre most of the time. Possibly 
Jens will do the 2.5.x side, of it (with Alan working on 2.4), but we've 
not talked it through.
I'd like Vojtech to be a bit involved too, he seemed to do some
much-needed cleanups for PIIX4 IDE (now gone, since we couldn't save just
those parts..)
