Some pgdat/zone scanning code will access it.
See: for_each_zone() and populated_zone().
AFAIK, in 2.6.9 age(means RHEL4), cpus on memory-less-node are moved to the
nearest node. And there were no useless pgdat.
Now, there are memory-less-node. Cpus on memory-less-node are on a pgdat
with empty-zone. I think this is very simple way rather than remapping.
And I think cpus on memory-less-node are sharing something (FSB,switch,etc..)
Tieing cpus to a memory-less-node may have some benefit.
