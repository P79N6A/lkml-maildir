Hi guys,
I've emailed this message 36 hours ago but since I can't see it in maling
list
I've thought that It may be loosed on the net.
I've made some changes to the scheduler finalized in avoiding linear scan
of all the run queue to find the most suitable task.
It should be faster in all environments where there are a lot of processes
ready to run.
My help request is, can You point me to a test ( benchmark ) suite with
which I can test my changes ?
It already exist or I must build one from my own ?
Cheers,
        Davide.
