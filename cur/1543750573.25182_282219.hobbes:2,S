This strikes me as being some damn petty politics on verizons part.  
I'm a customer because its the only game in town with affordable 
broadband, by at least 30 dollars a month.  So I'm stuck with it, or 
a friggin dialup that is also about 30 a month more expensive.
And it seems that everytime I use the "reply all" button on this list, 
I'll get at least 2 bounces because somebody elses server has 
blacklisted verizon for running an open relay 2 years ago, & never 
got around to lifting the ban when verizon rebuilt the systems last 
spring.
One should be carefull as that shoe can fit many feet. The CC: line of 
this message:
Jim Nelson <james4765@cwazy.co.uk>, Russell King 
<rmk+lkml@arm.linux.org.uk>, Andrew Morton <akpm@osdl.org>, 
kernel-janitors@lists.osdl.org
I'm curious as to who I will get a bounce from.
