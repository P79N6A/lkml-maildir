maybe.

We don't want to create duplicate address in any case.
ipv6_add_addr() IS right place.
And, we can return error code by using IS_ERR() etc.
I'll fix this.

It is not a problem because dev is always non-NULL.
However, it should be dev == NULL || ifp->idev->dev == dev.
Thanks.
(I don't understand what you mean by "you could return 0
before even acquiring the lock.")
