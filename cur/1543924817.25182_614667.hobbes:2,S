Just locking the tree root is not enough? (thereby avoiding all any new
modifying operation to descend into the tree).

Pin the sub-tree root with a reference, iterate the sub-tree and delete
the leafs one by one?

Right, so you say you have unbounded stack recursion? How about pushing
each probe into a stack (workqueue perhaps). Then each stack entry would
only do a single level probe, if it would recurse push a new entry on
the stack. Basic recursive -> stack transform.

I'd first start by asking if you want to lock all the children or the
sub-tree. The latter can be done by locking the root of said sub-tree.

Of course there is a natural deadlock free locking order in a tree: lock
the parent, lock all its children, repeat by noting that each child is a
parent again. If you only ever lock top down, there should not be any
lateral dependencies.

And only up to 8, as that's the max nesting depth.

Right, but does the grandparent really need serialisation? Normal simple
tree manipulations don't require more than 2 locks to guarantee tree
consistency. So you either don't have a simple tree, or you have more
requirements.

Ah, there are more constraints than tree order (which as I get it
resembles bus order)? Which confuses me, as you cannot detect a leaf
before you have a parent, so top-down should still be good, no?

D'0h, right you are. How about a delete, insert sequence?

      A
  B      C
D   E  F   G
In order to lock F we do:
  lock A, lock C, unlock A, lock F, unlock C
Look at it this way, either you're more complex than the VFS or it can
be annotated :-)
