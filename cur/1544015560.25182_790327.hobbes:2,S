The netdump I'm familiar with had the misfeature that it didn't do
packet retransmission, so when it was used on a customer network with
any amount of traffic, packets would get dropped and the crash dump
would utterly fail.  I honestly can't remember which enterprise distro
shipped it, but I can't say I was terribly impressed.  :-(
