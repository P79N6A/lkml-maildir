I mentioned earlier today we need someone to step up and write a kcompat.h
for 2.5 stuff like minor() and the new remap_page_range().
I'll have to do this anyway for the stuff I use (I already have oodles of
2.2 stuff) but it would be nice to be able to use a "standard" header (and .c
if necessary)
