Here user/admin atleast knows what he is doing. So they have to deal
with it. (Proper device naming solution would be great here).
But just by doing rmmod/insmod if my device names change, it will
be a pain. For example, in my case, i have to re-do all my raw device
bindings to just start the database. This will be a problem with 
dynamic <major, minor> assignments also. (Again, i will need a proper
device naming solution here).
Thanks,
