scsi_error_handler has tried to get a lock and somebody else has
already got it and is not letting go.  It is not clear from the source
of scsi_error_handler which lock is the problem.
objdump -S --start-address=0xeaf90180 --end-address=0xeaf902f0 vmlinux
will disassemble the scsi_error_handler routine, the object code will
probably mean something to the scsi maintainers.
The trick is to find out which routine is holding the lock.  It could
be an active routine or it could be caused by code that failed to
release a lock when it should.  To check for active routines, in kdb
set BTSECT=0
bta
that will do a backtrace on every process, without the section lines.
Look for any other process with scsi code in its backtrace, it is
suspect.
kdb can help diagnose the problem but the fix will have to come from
the scsi maintainers.
