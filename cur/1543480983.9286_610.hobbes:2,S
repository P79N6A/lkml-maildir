Hello Ted,
I have a strange problem with Linux (2.2-pre7): When I put pulses of 
100 and 200ms on the DCD pin (in parallel to the RxD pin) of my 
serial port (plain PC) every second, the receive code seems to 
swallow rather exactly every 10th pulse (read character). I can 
receive 9 characters without a problem though...
(Practically this makes my DCF77 receiver unusable. Unfortunately the 
same hardware/program works fine with 2.0.36)
I have searched the code for that 10 second value, but couldn't find 
it. Any ideas?
(With my PPS patches I have seen the opposite in 2.0 (and 2.1): Only 
every 10th pulse gets through, but it seems to depend a lot on 
timing. Most of the time the same code works. I have never found that 
mysterious 10 second thing...)
Can that DCD monitoring be disabled?
Regards,
Ulrich Windl
