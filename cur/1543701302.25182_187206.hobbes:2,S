Why? I want to keep my static device files in /dev. I don't even have
hotpluggable devices, and many months do pass before even one piece
of hardware gets changed (in which case I know what I have to do).
I don't want to eat any overhead or run any daemons or hotplug agents.
What benefit would there be in "random" numbers? More compressed number
space by giving out numbers sequentially? Or less having to work with
the numbers because they become just cookies and never need to be
inspected except in very small parts of the kernel?
