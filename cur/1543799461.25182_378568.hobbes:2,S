It is trivial to align to a given alignment in a call. Please search
the archives since this was needed for CPM2 and I've committed a patch.
As for mapping user space, since rheap only deals with addresses and never
touches the memory it's supposed to control, you can do pretty much everything.
I still don't understand what are you trying to do however.
Mind explaining?
