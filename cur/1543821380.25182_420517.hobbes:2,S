As I said, the lack of DNS is just the *start* of your troubles. Things just
get worse once you start trying to do error handling and other similar issues.
For instance, how do you intend to secure this "insert things directly into
the kernel"?
You *really* want to do this in userspace - if nothing else, it's a lot easier
to develop and debug userspace (when a userspace program you're debugging
crashes, you get a gdb prompt rather than a kernel panic), and it shouldn't be
put in the kernel unless there's no reasonable way to do it in userspace.
This is certainly well into the category of "If you have to ask if it's possible,
you're nowhere near qualified to make it work"...
