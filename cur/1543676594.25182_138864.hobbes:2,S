   If I read the source correctly, unregister_netdevice() simply does rip the 
   device out and sees what happens? It's a bit primitive, but should of 
   course work too.
The transition is half complete.  Eventually even that
"wait for refcount to hit zero" part will go away, and
also we will add the logic to mark the device at "dead"
and then teach all the sysfs/procfs routines to error out
if they see the device they are examining is in this state.
