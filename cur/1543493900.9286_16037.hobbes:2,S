To whom it may concern,
I'm using Linux slackware 4.0.0 and recently upgraded my kernel to 2.2.6.
I got that msg: /var/log/syslog ->> giving an incorrect version of kernel
after i've upgraded to kernel 2.2.6. 
How can i fix that?? It might something with syslog.conf ??
Let me know as soon as possible
