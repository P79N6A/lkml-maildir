This was a bug (?) in libgphoto2 which is fixed with 2.1.6rc2 or 
later.
Please download libgphoto2-2.1.6rc2 from sf.net/projects/gphoto 
and it will be fixed.
The technical problem was that that the libusb call
usb_set_configuration() could only be called with the USB interface
released via usb_release_interface() before.
I do not know why this is necessary, but we fixed it neithertheless.
Ciao, Marcus
