I was under the understanding a "patch" to something GPL, means
the "patch" is also GPL.  If the patch was not GPL, and it
patches GPL code, then it itself is in violation of the GPL.  The
fact that the patch is a "derivative work" of the original GPL
code, means it is GPL wether stated or not.
Someone removing a portion, and using it, must make their work
GPL as well.

But if the code is a modification to a GPL work, then it must be
GPL only.  In other words, a patch to the kernel which modifies
existing kernel files, MUST be GPL or else it is useless.  You
can call it "My private license" if you like, but that prevents
it from being used in the kernel because "My private license" is
not GPL compatible.  The key word is "derivative work" here.  If
your patch or other program is a derivative work of something
else GPL, you can NOT license it how you see fit.  If your code
contains code from other GPL sources as a whole, then you require
permission from those sources to relicense the code under a
different license.
If you didn't, one could make a kernel patch that modifies
existing kernel GPL code, say it is licenced as public domain,
and then allow Microsoft to use the patch which now contains
linux kernel GPL code as if it were not GPL'd.  That is not the
way it works at all.

Cool.  ;o)

I duly hope it is!

As will I when 2.4 final is released...

Good point..  That is one of the things I like most about Linux.

Right, and "Linux" is a word you can pronounce easily, and it
sounds cool.  Linus himself I believe when asked "why would one
use Linux over FreeBSD aside from the cool name" responded
something like "No that is the main reason - because Linux has a
cool name."
I about fell off my seat laughing when I read that one... I think
it is in the fortune database...  A good one-liner.  ;o)
