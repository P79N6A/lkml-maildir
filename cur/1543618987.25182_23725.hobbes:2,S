The kernel module is actually open-source and could even be merged in 
the kernel tree. If the modem was smart it would run its own firmware 
without relying on the client's machine to do it.
Q1: Are the ST USB drivers for Linux completely Open Source ?
A1: Alcatel supports the Open Source Movement, but feels it has to 
protect it's Intellectual property. Therefore, The drivers are only 
partially Open Source.
There is a open source kernel-module (GPL) and a closed source 
management application. The management application is distributed as a 
binary and contains the firmware.
