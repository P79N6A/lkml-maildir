You might want to add some throttling in swapout_pages() instead of 
relying on the block layer to do it for you.
There have been problems before with very large disk queues (IIRC it was
CFQ) in which all available memory became pinned by dirty data causing
OOM.
See throttle_vm_writeout() in mm/vmscan.c.
