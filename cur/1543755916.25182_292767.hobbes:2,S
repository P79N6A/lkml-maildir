Come on, claiming that you are only getting 50% of the information is 
just blatent FUD.  If you can't see that I can't help you.

You get a commitment from the group of BK complainers that that is good 
enough and we'll do it.  It may take a while because in the current way
that BK stores metadata it would be prohibitively expensive.  But we
want to change that anyway so we can prototype it on an internal tree
and see how well it works.
If/when we do this we'll reexport the 2.4 and 2.5 histories from scratch
so you get the info going backwards in time.
So, do you think you can sign up the usual suspects to being happy with
this answer?  And do you mind spelling out exactly what it is that you
think is being offered so there is no confusion later?
