Okay, I believe you... (someone told me once, Russell is right, and if
you do not believe him, he is still right ;-)

This remark is what convinced me :-))
I changed the interrupt handler from the simple_irq to the edge_irq,
and it works...!!
(I added a noop routine for that .ack part, because there is no ack)
I believe I was too focussed on the masking bug in the RT kernel on
the simple_irq() that I did not see that for the AT91 series the edge
type interrupt handler also works... (even better...) What I thought
was 1 single bug in the RT-kernel turned out to be a number of things
together that aren't correct, even for mainline.
So, to come to a conclusion: The masking bug in RT is still there in
the simple_irq path, and masking has to be removed from the simple_irq
code. Also for mainline. AT91 can live without simple_irq.
I think we are in sync again...
I will post a patch for the AT91 later on, after some more testing.
Kind Regards,
Remy
