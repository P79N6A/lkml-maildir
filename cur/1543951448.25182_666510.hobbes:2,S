(full quote below, because this message was in January)
I did some new tests, see 
http://zmi.at/x/wire.delayack2.pcap
Dump from SUSE10.3, Apple client had delayed ACK set to 2 with
sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.delayed_ack=2, and also MacOS10.5 has this 
problem. It was suggested I could have this problem:
http://www.helios.de/support/ti.phtml?110
On the same hardware, I can start the old SUSE10.0 at the same time in 
parallel with the new SUSE10.3, both are virtual machines in VMware, 
and the old machine is always fast and the new one always slow. From 
the dump I would say it's the fault of MacOS - sometimes a very long 
delay before an ACK. But then again, it's fast when copying to the old 
SUSE linux box. Very strange.
