Of course the common code is just completly correct and it's also the most
finegrined code we could write there. Also to optimize the x86
implementation we did a set_mb() to let x86 to use xchg while other archs 
does a strightforward write + mb().

For the wait_event interface case the memory barrier must be put between
setting the current->state and the reading if the event happened.
set_current_state() will achieve that (also efficiently).
Each time you write code that runs SMP threaded you must insert the proper
barriers and you must consider each case separately. That's why writing
SMP threaded code is harder ;).
