That's not always true.
Imagine a slow computer with a GBit ethernet connection, where the user 
is downloading files from a server that can utilize the full 
network connection while listening to music from his local disk with 
XMMS.
In this case, the audio stream is not depending on the network 
connection. And the user might prefer dropped packages over a stuttering 
XMMS.

What do you want to achieve with this thread?
1. Try to proof that Linux is inferior to *BSD?
2. Get help with your problem?
If your goal is 1. feel free to do so, but please do so on more 
appropriate lists.
If your goal is 2., you must help the people who are trying to help you 
with _your_ problem.
E.g. Patrick McHardy asked you:
<--  snip  -->
In that case please send more information, like both 2.4
and 2.6 configs, dmesg output from booting, lspci output,
other hardware details, ..
<--  snip  -->
Crystal balls are rare, and if your goal is really to get problem solved 
you should send the information other people require for debugging your 
problem.
