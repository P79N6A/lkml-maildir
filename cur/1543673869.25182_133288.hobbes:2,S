Hi Michel,
In regards to the Alpha platform: Jeff Wiedemeier was able to get things
to work after applying the attached small patch.  He says:
  What was happening is that the offset was a system-relative
  representation of the address and the (agpmem->bound) was
  bus-relative, so it couldn't find the right agpmem.
  This patch makes the offset bus-relative before the scan (and with
  this patch, DRI/DRM is working on a Marvel...)
If it looks OK to you, can you add it?
Thanks,
	--david
