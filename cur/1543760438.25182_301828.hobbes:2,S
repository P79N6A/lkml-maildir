-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
This wrecks the ipv6 modular build for a lot of people.
In fact, since I always build ipv6 modular I am surprised
I never hit this.  My best guess is that my compiler is
optimizing the reference away, but that can never be
depended upon and the symbol export really is needed.
[TCP]: Put back tcp_timer_bug_msg[] symbol export.
  
It is needed for tcp_reset_xmit_timer(), which is invoked by
tcp_prequeue() which is invoked from tcp_ipv6.c
