Well, Karsten Keil and me are listed for that, and I think Karsten is 
actually actively working on fixing problems there. I've been far away 
from any ISDN equipment for the past 1 1/2 years now, which combined with 
a certain lack of time unfortunately reduced my ability to contribute, but 
I'm still there to take questions and review patches.
