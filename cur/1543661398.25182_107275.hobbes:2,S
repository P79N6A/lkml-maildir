I prefer buggy driver be fixed ASAP. The first step is to know
that there *is* a (jiffywize-) buggy driver or something.
Jiffie wrap at 5 mins is done this way: jiffies is initialized to -5*60*HZ
instead of zero at boot. Accounting code is adjusted e.g. not to show 400+
days uptime (it subtracts -5*60*HZ from jiffies).
Jiffies wraps to zero in five minutes. Box should survive with no probs.
If it instead hangs, oops or otherwise feeling bad, you have a jiffy wrap
bug somewhere.
Today you need to wait 400 or so days before you can test what will happen.
Production servers' admins getting a bit nervous close to that date ;)
A nice printk "Timer code check..." at jiffies = -30*HZ
and "...timer code check passed" at jiffies = 30*HZ will let us have
good bug reports ("what was your last log message?") and would not
scare people. "A jiffie would wrap in 5 seconds!" is not that good -
please do not unnecessarily scare new users ;)
