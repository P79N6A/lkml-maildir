With the proprietary nvidia module, the laptop resumes, but the screen
stays black. Meanwhile I tested the nvidiafb module, with identical
results: machine comes back from suspend, but with a black screen. Now
I cann ssh into it and do a proper shutdown or whatever. This is of
course nonsatisfying and I'm still playing around.
I haven't tested noapic, nolapic so far. This is a UP kernel.
Regards, Olaf.
