Hi,
some review comments below

can't this be a mutex instead ?

can this be const ?

eh shouldn't you do the readl()'s inside the semaphore (or mutex) area?

you're missing a PCI posting flush here
(if you don't know what this is please ask)

you shouldn't look at dev->irq ...

.. before calling pci_enable_device() since pci_enable_device() may be
the one that sets the dev->irq value to it's final value in the first
place

you know how to use pci_resource_start() and co.. why not use them 3
lines higher ? ;)
the driver looks quite clean otherwise btw, great work!
