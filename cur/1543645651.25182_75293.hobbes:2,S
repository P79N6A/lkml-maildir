I'm having real trouble spotting substantive change in the patch that
would affect a UP kernel.  I believe you when you say it fixes your
problem, but we don't know why, and it is worth making some effort to
find out why.
Ah wait, I see one candidate, would you like to try:
                 * the page as well.
                 */
                if (page->buffers) {
                        /* avoid to free a locked page */
-                       get_page(page);
                        spin_unlock(&pagemap_lru_lock);
+                       get_page(page);
 
and see if your bug comes back?  There are a couple of other changes
that could be considered substantive by stretching one's imagination
enough, but this is the leading candidate.
Oh wait, you could also try this, a little further down:
+                                       page_cache_release(page);
                                        spin_lock(&pagemap_lru_lock);
-                                       put_page_nofree(page);
By the way, the original patch you posted was reversed and your editor
apparently took the liberty of cleaning up some whitespace in the file.
Generally, we try do avoid patch chunks that just, e.g., change bogus
spaces to tabs, and save those for official whitespace patches.
