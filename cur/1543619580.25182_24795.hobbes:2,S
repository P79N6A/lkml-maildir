all the hashes should be allocated with the bootmem allocator, that
doesn't have the MAX_ORDER limit. Not only the pagecache hash, that is
the only one replaced.
In short, for an optimal comparison between hash and radix tree, we'd
need to fixup the hash allocation with the bootmem allocator first.
