Cool...  Any/all comments are definitely welcome...

Um, yes!  I don't quite know how, though...  I call sys_register_root() 
for each of the nodes...  That call seems to parent them under the 
root/sys directory...  How can I change that?

Yes...  I have some patches that I'm working that will put PCI busses 
and devices into the topology infrastructure (both in-kernel & via 
driverfs).  Again, this is just a first pass of what I'd like to see... ;)
Cheers!
