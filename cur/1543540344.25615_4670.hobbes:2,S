Which is normal and definitely not reiserfs-dependent.
As for some hint: use "noflushd" (try freshmeat). With that, you don't loose
atime (which is very important for many things, like /tmp cleanup) and your
disks still do not spin up.
I use it on my answering machine, and unless I receive e-mail (fsync ;), or
the memory cache is full (very rare, as i receive lots of e-mail), the disks
stay down.
At night, when I don't route mail to my machine, the disks are usually down
for hours.
You could, of course, just disable atime but that's far worse a solution, as
every write will trigger a spin up.
