There are use cases than can be solved better via iSCSI and a
filesystem than via a network filesystem. One such use case is when
deploying a virtual machine whose data is stored on a network server:
in that case there is only one user of the data (so there are no
locking issues) and filesystem and block device each run in another
operating system: the filesystem runs inside the virtual machine and
iSCSI either runs in the hypervisor or in the native OS.
