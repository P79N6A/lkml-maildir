sorry I do not understand: what do you mean with a dedicated machine ?
the mmap() case has to be handled as well, or we will still be in a situation
where linux will be unsuitable for professional work.

I disagree here, who can ensure that while doing low-latency work
you don't do this and that and that other ?
a low-latency OS means that it can achieve reasonable (1-5ms) under
high load conditions (at least for ONE SCHED_FIFO task),
all the other solutions not acceptable and I prefer to work with high
latencies reliably rather than having low latencies with a nice
crackle/noise floor in the audio stream.

Yes this is a good strategy, at least we will see which
"random pre-emption points" are pretty useless.

PS2 is causing high latencies, on std kernels, Ingo's kernel handles this just
nicely.
