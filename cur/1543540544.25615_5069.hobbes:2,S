Hello:
I note that the 2.4 series kernels have version 3.2M of the Advansys scsi driver included in the source tree.
The latest driver available on the Advansys (now connectcom.net) site is 3.3A.
Is the newer 3.3A driver known to be unstable or hazardous in some way? If not, should it be included in the 2.4 release?
thanks,
