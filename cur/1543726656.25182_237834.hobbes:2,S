LOL.  But, the last overclocking I did was when i figured out that
removing the 'SPEED' jumper on my 486/33 would make it run at 50Mhz.  I
am actually working on an embedded system (well, small anyway).  I have
never used Gentoo.
Even if it's not appropriate for this case, there have to be some places
in the kernel where this would be useful.  What about hardware that is 
broken, requiring a device-specific kludge?  Hardware that the kernel
developers would prefer didn't exist.  There have to be some of these. 
Or are most of these already broken out and disabled by default like the
old CMD640 ide bug?
