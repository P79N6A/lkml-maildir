Known problem.  The cause, as you noted is duplicate EXPORT_SYMBOLs in
netsyms.c and the netfilter code.  Rusty Russell does not appear to be
responding to email queries, though.
LINUS:  In the absence of a response from Mr. Russell, the maintainer,
this needs to be fixed.  Do you want a patch with EXPORT_SYMBOLs in
net/netsyms.c or in net/ipv4/netfilter/*.c?
