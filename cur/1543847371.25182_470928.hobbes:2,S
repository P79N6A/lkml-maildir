As per Documentation/CodingStyle 
"Functions can return values of many different kinds, and one of the
most common is a value indicating whether the function succeeded or
failed.  Such a value can be represented as an error-code integer
(-Exxx = failure, 0 = success) or a "succeeded" boolean (0 = failure,
non-zero = success)."
That means if the function need to indicate success it should be made to return 0. 
I don't see any other value being returned from init_srcu_struct. Also having a consistent
style of if() check make code reading easier.
