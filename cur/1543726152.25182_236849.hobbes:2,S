Ok, That is fairly simple, and can be implemented easily, so it is
a good place to start.
A buffer to save old kernel state is needed.  At the very least
we need to save the old register state, copying over several megabytes
of data won't hurt the picture.
It has a little more exposure to on-going DMA transfers than running
from a reserved area of memory, as some of that memory may have been
setup as DMA buffers by the dying kernel. 
If it turns out that on-going DMA is a problem I see that as something
we can fix later on.

Yes I would like to look at that.  
I am tempted to suggest the data buffer with the registers and memory
actually be in ELF format with virtual address representing where the
data was in memory, and the physical addresses reporting where the
data actually is in memory now.  Then we could just grab everything
with /dev/mem..
But I don't know how much of pain this would be.
