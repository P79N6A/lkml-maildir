The filename does not matter. If it sits in an RPM, then it
is good for the version of base kernel that the RPM uses.
I know for the fact that Stephen updated it for cooperation
with add_gendisk/del_gendisk in 2.4.16, so the patch is
maintained actively. I would not worry about it, it's a good
patch.
