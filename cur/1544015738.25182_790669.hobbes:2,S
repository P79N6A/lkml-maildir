My Linux Foundation mail address still works, and I can still have
access to old software at my account there. But as of Decemeber 2007,
I work for Vyatta.  The marketing department would like the attribution
in statistics to be Vyatta, it is not a big issue for me.

Thanks Dave.
But I wonder that whether Stephen still be LF people.
If not, I will separate these two addresses to different employers.
