Only followed your advice.  (-;  But yes, it is not very nice at all.

But the write() side of things don't need s_umount or trylocking with
the proposed find_or_create_pages(), either...
Unfortunately it is not possible to do this since removing
->{prepare,commit}_write() from NTFS would mean that we cannot use loop
devices on NTFS any more and this is a really important feature for
several Linux distributions (e.g. TopologiLinux) which install Linux on
a loopback mounted NTFS file which they then use to place an ext3 (or
whatever) fs on and use that as the root fs...
So we definitely need full blown prepare/commit write.  (Unless we
modify the loop device driver not to use ->{prepare,commit}_write
first.)
Any ideas how to solve that one?

I guess it would be possible but ->nopage is used for the read case and
why would we want to then cause writes/allocations?  Example: I create a
sparse file of 2TiB size and put some data in relevant places.  Then an
applications mmap()s it and does loads of reads on the mmap()ped file
and perhaps a write here or there.  Do we really want that to start
allocating and filling in all read holes?  That seems worse than having
a square peg for a round hole that is hidden away in a single function.
There is nothing in the proposed find_or_create_pages() that means it
needs to go into mm/filemap.c.  It could easily be a private function in
fs/ntfs/aops.c.  I just thought that other fs who want to support
writing to large block sizes might find it useful and having a shared
copy in mm/filemap.c would be better in that case.  But if it is too
ugly to go in mm/filemap.c then that is fine, too.
At the moment I cannot see a way to solve my problem without the
proposed find_or_create_pages().  )-:
