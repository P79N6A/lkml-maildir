You can grab it at:
        
ftp://mozart.stat.wisc.edu/pub/misc/patch-2.4.0-test5-sysreq
It doesn't dump all CPUs; it just dumps whichever one handles the
SysReq request, so I just keep doing it until I get them both.

Okay.  I've actually determined that my window manager (Enlightenment)
creates a shared memory segment for the X server to map and unmap
anywhere from 25 to 100 times a second; the segment appears in the X
server's memory map at the address 0x40014000 that "shm_nopage" was
trying to fault in when my lockup occurred.
I didn't notice it before because the time the page is mapped is
small.  To catch it, I had to do
        while true; do egrep 40014000 /proc/xxx/maps; done
and wait a bit.  A "printk" for shm_mmapping at address 0x40014004
gave me the 25-100 times per second figure.
The fact that this has crashed once in all the time I've been using
this setup would seem to imply a very subtle race condition.  Ugh.
Can you offer me a tutorial on the SHM locking?  What's supposed to
protect against what?
In the meantime, I'll keep plugging away at it.
