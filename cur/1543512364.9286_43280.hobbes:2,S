Thank you for many insights especially the quantative
discussion concerning the earlier post of mine.
Please send any other tips to me.
I will summarize them and contact Mr. Sagai since
he doesn't seem to read linux-scsi / linux-kernel himself.
(I am not sure if he can assemble 4 or 6 SCSI disks for additional
raid configuration in a short time or if he can move up to 2.3.x series
easily, but one of my friends who's a  college researcher may.)
Again thank you and send any hints/tips/suggestions coming.
Regards
Chiaki Ishikawa
