With the speed, yes.  With the stability, no.  I use it on my desktop
now, as that's for games, and use xfs on cryptoloop for my laptop.  I
hope to replace that with reiser4 and some crypto plugin someday.  I'll
follow this up with the specific problems in a bit.

In fact, regarding the whole "innovation" thing, Microsoft and others
have occasionally announced that they were going to create a filesystem
which could act as a database (or the other way around), and generally
introduce some of the features reiser4 has solid by now.
Every time I've seen such a thing announced, it flops later.  It becomes
a userland project, or an abandoned project, and definitely nowhere near
as usable.  Reiser4, however, seems to already have that kind of
functionality -- it's efficient at storing lots of tiny flat text files,
and searching them randomly.
I haven't run any benchmarks against "real" databases like mysql, but if
we want to talk about what V4 obsoletes, it obsoletes things which
haven't even been developed/released yet (WinFS on Longhorn).
