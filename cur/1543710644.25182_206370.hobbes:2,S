hm, I hadn't noticed that 2.4 was changed to _not_ add anon pages to the
LRU.  I'd always regarded that as a workaround for pagemap_lru_lock contention
on large SMP machines which would never get beyond the suse kernel.
Having a magic knob is a weak solution: the majority of people who are
affected by this problem won't know to turn it on.
I confess that I don't really understand the failure mode.  So we have
zillions of anon pages which are not on the LRU.  We call swap_out() and
scan all these pages, failing to find swapcache space for them.
Why does adding the pages to the LRU up-front solve the problem?
(And why cannot we lazily add these anon pages to the LRU in swap_out, and
avoid the need for the knob?)
