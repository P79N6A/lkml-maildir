Client side krb5 authentication was added in November last
year. Privacy and integrity are queued but fell afoul of the
code-freeze. I'll bun(d|g)le them into an NFS_ALL after we've tested
them out in the v4 Bakeathon in Austin (so in about a fortnight).
I believe the server support is ready too but hasn't yet been merged
in due to bugs in the upcall mechanism.

I'm cherrypicking the relevant bugfixes from CITI and folding those
into the tree. Much of the rest will be part of the forthcoming
NFS_ALL.
Cheers,
