Hello all,
I am trying to upgrade my kernel from 2.0.36 to 2.2.10.  I'm running
RedHat 5.2 on my machine.  I got the full distribution and unpacked it to
a directory in my /usr/src directory, and modified the /usr/src/linux link
to point to where the new kernel source is.  I run 'make config' from my
/usr/src/linux directory, and configure the kernel.  But then when I do a
'make dep', I get several errors like the following:  "scripts/mkdep.c:13:
ctype.h:  No such file or directory".  Any of the header files which are
being included in the '/usr/src/linux/scripts/mkdep.c' file with the
#include statements are not being found.  Some of the files I can find in
various places on my disk, such as '/usr/src/linux/include/linux/ctype.h'
(the c program doesn't find it though.)  But some files I can't find
anywhere on my disk, such as 'stdio.h' and 'sys/stat.h' I get the same
types of errors when trying to run 'make xconfig' or 'make menuconfig'
Is there something else I must do/install before I can go from 2.0.36 to 
2.2.10???
Thank you in advance for any assistance you may be able to provide me.
