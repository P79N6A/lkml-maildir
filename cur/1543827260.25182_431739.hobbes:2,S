Your driver also uses lots of kernel version dependent
code in the main driver file.
Please implement new kernel API functions using old kernel API
functions and put these into your existing gdth_kcompat.h file.
Rationale: Linux drivers are required to be forward compatible instead of
	backward compatible. More details per private email, if your needed.
Other issues with your patch were already raised by Andrew and Christoph.

Ingo Oeser
