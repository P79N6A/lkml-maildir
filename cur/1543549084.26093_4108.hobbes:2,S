2.2.16,  migrated FreeBSD to Linux on production system this weekend.
Dreamed that I just leave ufs there without copying the stuff.
1. First - it mounted a ufs but showed nothing.... long time to find the
44bsd senseless
option.
2. ok, linux up&running, samba and MS Windows Nx100MB profiles copying by few
users.
    After a while - MS tells me : media is read-only.... what a hell.
    going to command line - the partition IS now readonly....
3. -o remount,rw  : disk full (not really)
It would be nice, if for 2.4 there would be mandatory printk for expermiental
and non-production modules.
So after a year someone would not try to use that stuff on production system.
elmer.
