   Why wouldn't it be much better to delegate this job to a userspace
daemon? The advantages I see are
 - easier customisation of OOM killing rules. Write your own OOM daemon if
   the existing one isn't satisfactory.
 - if you don't want OOM killing, simply don't run the daemon.
 - smaller kernel.
