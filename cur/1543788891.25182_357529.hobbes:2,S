Okay. I have to take a "work break", but you can check the
driver and see if the code is interruptible (it must be)
and if there is something like if(signal_pending(current))
get_to_hell_out_of_this_loop.... in the time-out loop.
You can check against 2.4 code to see what's changed (a lot).
Sometimes with massive re-writes, simple things are forgotten.

The tty drivers were modified.
