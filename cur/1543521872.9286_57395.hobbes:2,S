Hi--
I wasn't sure if this was the correct outlet for this problem, but I 
noticed many postings of these types of problems on the kernel archive, and 
I wanted to know if this was a new problem or not.
I've tried burning a standard directory full of information on a 700 MB 
Memorex disk a number of times, but I seem to have this problem no matter 
what front end/command line options I use.  (similarly, I seem to be unable 
to burn with 2x speed, separate problem?) Has anyone seen this?
Kernel = 2.2.14
Scsi = aic7xxx (Adaptec 2902)
CDROM = Philips CDD 2600
Software = cdrecord 1.8a39
Front End = gcombust, BurnIt, and others (same problem with all)
Here's the output.
