There were very similar problems reported in the past and they were
fixed by replacing power supply with a better one.
Also you shouldn't need to use "ide=nodma" and play with hdparm,
driver should tune the best mode available.  If this doesn't work then
something needs fixing.
You can find out if BIOS/driver configures cards correctly by
comparing PCI config space (lspci -xxx) for working/non-working
controller.
