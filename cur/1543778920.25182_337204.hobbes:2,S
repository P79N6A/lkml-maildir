Damn me - sorry for the misinformation... I've compiled the kernel
without Debian-loved initrd image... 
so I've booted 2.6.12.3 -- LED light is on - so I bet no blame on libata
patch, although I've mentioned few patches from that patch migrated into
the mainstream kernel.   
Any ideas on which next step to take? 2.6.13-rc4? or vanilla 2.6.11?
