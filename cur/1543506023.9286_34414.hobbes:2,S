This other incremental patch will make the bigmem code safe w.r.t. raw-io:

But now IMO there's to choose between one of the below options:
1) should we change all device drivers to allow us to do I/O over
   bigmem pages? NOTE: all DMA engine are just fine since virt_to_bus
   just works right as Gerhard pointed out to me. The only problem is for
   drivers that reads and writes to the b_data in software.
2) should we change ll_rw_block to force an high limit of bh queued in
   the same request and then remap the b_data in the ll_rw_block layer
   with a NR_REQUEST*MAX_BH_PER_REQUEST array of virtual-pages in the
   fixmap area? (many tlb_flush_all... or at least many SMP-invlpg with a 
   smarter cross-CPU-invlpg message)
   virt_to_bus must be able to resolve the bus address starting from
   the fixmap virtual address.
3) using the remap trick that I am just using in the swapout/swapin code,
   I could just do raw-io on anonymous memory but I get stuck with the shm
   memory where I can't simply realloc a page without browsing all
   processes VM. Should I take a list of all pte that are mapping
   each smp page and doing the remap trick also on shm memory?
4) should I avoid raw-io in the shm memory and use the remap trick
   with the anonymous memory?
5) should I avoid bigmem in shm memory and simply use the remap trick
   with the anonymous memory?
I guess big databases uses the shm memory as cache. And I guess they use
raw-io to fill the shm memory with proper data. Am I right about this? If
so I can't choose (4). And since I would like to use the bigmem as shm
memory I would like to avoid also (5).
(3) looks dirty and add a performance hit in the shm_nopage hander.
(2) looks dirty and slow due the SMP tlb flushes.
(1) looks clean and efficient (100% efficient in the DMA case!) but it
    breaks all drivers out there... :(((
Theorically the cleanest solution would be (1) but I don't know if this
will be a good choice on the long run (theorically on 2038 we won't need
CONFIG_BIGMEM anymore...).
Right now I temporary applyed solution (0): the patch at the top of this
email so if you want to use raw-io on anonymous or shm memory you'll have
to recompile with CONFIG_BIGMEM not set.
Comments? (very welcome :)
