Well, not to get into a debate, but think about whether
"/usr/sbin/sshd /bin/bash" and "/sbin/mingetty /bin/bash" is more
understandable to an administrator than "remote shell" vs. "local shell"
- the label-based approach lets you map the low-level detail of
individual programs/pathnames to abstract equivalence classes that are
more understandable, not less.  Further, think about the advantages of
being able to encode only the security-relevant invocations, not all of
them.
On a different note, from a quick look, it looks like TOMOYO is AppArmor
+ invocation history from a user perspective.  Plus a wider range of
controls in your original implementation, but your LSM implementation
seems to be just getting started and only deals with files.  So what's
the case for having a whole separate security module vs. a small
extension to AppArmor?
