Hi, 
I am software engineer at a french research institute, in charge of the linux 
support on about 600 computers. I am looking for laptops whith linux
support/certification. I couln't find any recent laptop model on your
certification page. Would you recomend me any brand of computer ?
We curently buy Compaq Evos laptops, but enabling linux on those laptops
is terrible :
- - power management seems to be ACPI only (which linux barely supports)
- - sound is hard or impossible to setup correctly.
Any help/advice would be apreciated.
