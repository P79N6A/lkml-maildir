Would't it be better to split drivers:
sound/core.c
sound/alsa/alsa-core.c
sound/alsa/drivers/alsa-emu10k.c
sound/oss/oss-core.c
sound/oss/drivers/oss-emu10k.c
low level card drivers are different, and this way oss and alsa are
independent subtrees.
BTW, 2.5.x was born to be broken, so this is the moment to reorganize
the beast (better before than after kbuild 2.5 ?)
