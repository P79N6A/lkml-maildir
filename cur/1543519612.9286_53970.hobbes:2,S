Interesting idea, though I'm not sure if I'm understanding
you right. Do you have anything places that describe this
in more detail?

Here I'm confused. There is no one-to-one mapping between
userids and capabilities. Do you mean that each {user,group,etc}id
has associated with it a set of capabilities which go beyond
just the simple bits in the capability structs. Then you
extend the fd passing machanism to handle passing of any of 
these around.

This program, afaics, will not require any changes to any
other programs. I want it basically so I can add 'exec scap NET_RAW'
to my .bash_profile so I can test all my networking programs
and run tcpdump without having to open a root console.

So they can kill the process even if it changes its userid? This
would probably require some encryption to prevent people faking
the strings.

Sounds like what you really want is the separation of userids as an
identification mechanism and the rights granted by that. So the user
has a userid and associated with that they have an NT id, a set of
capabilities and other such things, all of which give rights to certain
objects.

Not quite sure what you mean here.

I've always thought it would be nice if you could send UIDs, GIDs
and other such things over a socket. You could then abstract this
whole thing to a user-space daemon (capd? authd?) which the login
script could connect to and be given all the approprite rights.

No idea what you mean here.

I've no idea. Is this the kind of security models they use on
mainframes?
