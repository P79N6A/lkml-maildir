The problem is a circular include reference.
Specifically, linux/sched.h eventually causes us to
include asm/string.h, where we have:
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_USE_3DNOW
/* All this just for in_interrupt() ... */
#include <asm/system.h>
#include <asm/ptrace.h>
#include <linux/smp.h>
#include <linux/spinlock.h>
#include <linux/interrupt.h>
#include <asm/mmx.h>
The include of interrupt.h is what causes us to ultimately include
asm/hw_irq.h, which breaks because of the inline x86_do_profile(),
which refers to prof_buffer, prof_len, and prof_shift, which are
declared in sched.h starting at line 491.  
Arrgh.
