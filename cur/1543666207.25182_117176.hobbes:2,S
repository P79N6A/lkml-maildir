Hi Alan,
    for 2.4.21-pre5-ac2 and -ac3 patch also.
    there's still problem on reset. when I do 'hdparm -w /dev/hda' once
after another, all seems ok.  but when I make a shell script and let
'hdparm -w' run in several times loop, system would always crashed
at the second time and left oops messages:
    kernel BUG at ide.c:1700!
    ...
so, if any bugs still locking there?
