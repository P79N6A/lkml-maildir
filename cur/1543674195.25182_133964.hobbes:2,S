I for one would want the ability to select, poll and epoll on a futex while
also being notified of availability of data on sockets. I see no alternative
even, except for messing with signals or running select with a small
timeout, introducing needless latency.
It may be weird, but it does work in practice. 'Unrobust' would be a problem
but I fail to see how this is unclean.
Thanks.
