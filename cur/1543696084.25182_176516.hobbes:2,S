This is actually _really_ trivial to see with a simple test program.
This is Fedora Core test3:
	#include <stdlib.h>
	/* Change this to match your CPU */
	#define NR (10*1000*1000)
	int main(int argc, char **argv)
	{
	        int i;
	        for (i = 0; i < NR; i++)
	                putchar(0);
	}
and then just time it.
I get:
	torvalds@home:~> time ./a.out > /dev/null 
	real    0m1.305s
	user    0m1.283s
	sys     0m0.004s
and
	torvalds@home:~> time LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.1 ./a.out > /dev/null 
	
	real    0m0.321s
	user    0m0.318s
	sys     0m0.003s
ie a factor of _four_ difference in the speed of "putchar()".
Interestingly, if I compile the program statically, I don't see this 
effect, and it's noticeably faster still:
	torvalds@home:~> gcc -O2 -static test.c 
	torvalds@home:~> time ./a.out > /dev/null 
	real    0m0.193s
	user    0m0.191s
	sys     0m0.002s
	torvalds@home:~> time LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.1 ./a.out > /dev/null 
	real    0m0.194s
	user    0m0.190s
	sys     0m0.004s
Is the TLS stuff done through an extra dynamically loaded indirection or
something?
