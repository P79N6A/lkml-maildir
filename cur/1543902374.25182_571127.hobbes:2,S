Actually I'd worked on what was called MPSS (Multiple Page Size Support)
before I ever started on pgcl. Some large portion of the pgcl proposal
as I presented it internally was to reduce the order of large page
allocations and provide a promotion and demotion mechanism enabling
different processes to have different sized translations for the same
large page, and hence no out-of-context pagetable/TLB updates during
promotion and demotion, essentially by making the TLB translation to
page relation M:N. ISTR describing this in a KS presentation for which
IIRC you were present. But that's neither here nor there.

In any event, that is a sound strategy for mitigating internal
fragmentation of pagecache, though internal fragmentation of anonymous
memory has more severe consequences and is less easily mitigated.
