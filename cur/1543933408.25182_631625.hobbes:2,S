Well, having considered that for a longer while, I think the AML code is
referring to a device that we have suspended already, and since it's in a low
power state, it just can't handle the reference.
If that is the case, we'll have to find the device (that should be possible
using some code instrumentation) and move the suspending of it into the late
stage.
