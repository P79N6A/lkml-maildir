It doesn't break it. It reduces it to current speeds.
I might be wrong, but it seems to me that O_STREAMING isn't the answer
to everything. The primary benefactors of O_STREAMING would be
applications that read very large files that do not fit into RAM, from
start to finish.
If you want to improve grepping the kernel tree, the answer lies in
improving the standard scheme, not overloading the specialized
O_STREAMING scheme.
