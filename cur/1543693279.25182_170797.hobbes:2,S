No. The range of addresses for floppy disk controllers is
"reserved" for floppy disk controllers. That's the rule for
IBM/PC/AT/Intel compatible devices. This is specified in
the literature like that written by Phoenix, IBM, etc.
(Phoenix Technical Reference Series, System BIOS for
IBM PC/XT/AT and Compatible Computers.  ISBN 0-201-51806-6
We have rules. That's what "Compatible" means. If you break
the compatibility by putting something else at that address,
you take your chances.
When the Super I/O chips are programmed, the floppy device,
(usually logical device 0) is (must) be put at the base
address reserved for floppy disks in compatible machines.
It's the rule. If you are using the same chip in some non-
compatible machine (like a power-PC), they have rules where
the floppy must be addressed, too. These addresses are
different for different architectures and, some machines
don't have I/O ports, they are memory mapped. In those
cases, the floppy is put at some memory-mapped address.
For the architecture in the linux i386 subdirectory, which
is what I was talking about, there will either be a FDC
controller output register at 0x372, with the bits previously
taught, or there will be nothing. It's that simple. If
you make it more complicated, then you don't understand
what compatibility means.
Cheers,
