	I wasn't sure of the etiquette -- I'd thought that by saying you had
signed it off that meant you were accepting my modifications, and didn't
want to presume. But I will change it if you like. No slight intended.
	Unfortunately I don't have a changelog, and since I've since forward
ported the changes it would be hard to produce. If you want to review it
you should probably review it all, because the forward porting may have
introduced issues.
