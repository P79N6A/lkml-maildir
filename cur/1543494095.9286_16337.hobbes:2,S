Hi
Yesterday, i added 64Mb of memmory to a box i have (compaq deskpro 575, 2.0.36
kernel) and it never got to recognise it. I tried to boot linux and it got it
all. But during the boot, i got this :
Uhhuh. NMI received. Dazed and confused, but trying to continue
You probably have a hardware problem with your RAM chips or a
power saving mode enabled.
It's comming from arch/i386/kernel/traps.c :
asmlinkage void do_nmi(struct pt_regs * regs, long error_code)
{
#ifndef CONFIG_IGNORE_NMI
        printk("Uhhuh. NMI received. Dazed and confused, but trying to continue\n");
        printk("You probably have a hardware problem with your RAM chips or a\n");
        printk("power saving mode enabled.\n");
#endif  
#endif
}
The thing i'd like to know is what's going on, is it gonna hurt by any way :)
what does it mean..
