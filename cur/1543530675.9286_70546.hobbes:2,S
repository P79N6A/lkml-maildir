Most file systems do. People who implement maildir properly use subdirectories
for good reasons.

It looks like memory corruption - possibly from a kernel race or vfs

Maildir is great, but use a non screwball implementation that divides

Well actually you can download and try Reiserfs for 2.2 right now, and it
is supposed to handle your huge directories and the latest one has
journals. You can also add the ext3 patches and get journalling without
a disk reformat but it wont solve your big directory problem.
