Red Hat ships SELinux enabled by default with a set of policies that
most users just leave enabled, indeed most users don't even know they
have SELinux enabled or what SELinux is, any more than they could say
tell you what posix acls do.
That said there is a need for nice pretty policy design tools, but
that's not part of an LSM discussion.

If the AppArmour people care to submit their code upstream and get it
merged then that would be a reason to keep LSM, if they don't then LSM
(if they even want it..) can just become part of their patchkit instead.

In Fedora Core its impact is far from obvious from my testing. Older
SELinux had some ugly SMP scaling problems but those are fixed.
