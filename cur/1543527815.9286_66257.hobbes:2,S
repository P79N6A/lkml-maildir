Yes. See BUGTRAQ for the latest method to use named as a flood generator.

Yes. 
There is a list of publically available time servers. Most of them stratum 1 (or
2 at worst). Scanning for one instead of using a known publically available
server is at least strange ;-)
Lists are at:

And caldera config utility should ask before scanning after it has failed to
locate resources via DHCP. That is besides the fact that it should try BOOTPC,
bootparams, rdisc and a couple of other things as well if DHCP fails . And warn
the user of course that it is going to fire at random at everything that
moves ;-)
This is OT, inbtw ;-)
