You might consider UPX (

Very cool. The beta version supports compressing the kernel
and "direct-to-memory" compression. I think it still
has the disadvantage of not sharing segments between many
instances of the same program. Is there any way of fixing
this? (probably would have to hack a bit with the loader?)
For a general solution I would look @ changing the filesystem
so that particular files (not just executables) can be compressed/
decompressed transparently. (I.E. for ext2 implement `chattr +c`).
