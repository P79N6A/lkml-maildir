Red Hat's 2.4.21-9.EL kernel?  ;-)
Seriously, I've already set up 3 new bk trees on linux-scsi.bkbits.net. 
They are 2.4-for-marcelo, 2.4-drivers, and 2.4-everything.  Right now
the trees are still just clones of your current tree.  The plan,
however, is to sort through all of the scsi patches we put into our
kernels and put them into the various trees.  Obviously, the everything
tree will have both the iorl and mlqueue patches plus the other stuff. 
The for-marcelo tree is stuff that is agreed to be appropriate for
mainline.  The drivers tree is where I'll start sticking driver updates
that come across linux-scsi for the 2.4 kernel.

Well, that's a hard to answer question.  First, the problem only shows
up on drivers that actually enabled tagged queuing and use a reasonably
deep queue depth (normally).  So, that automatically strikes out most of
the older ISA and crap hardware drivers since they only do a command at
a time.  The better drivers; aic7xxx (new and old), ncr53c8xx, sym1 and
sym2, qla2x00, etc.; work around the problem.  It's mainly newer drivers
that vendors are starting to write and who don't know the history of the
broken mid layer handling of QUEUE_FULL and BUSY situations.  So, I
cited the two I know of off the top of my head, and there may be others
but I would actually have to look at the source code to identify them
(when 98% of the scsi market is QLogic and NCR/SYM and aic7xxx, those
other drivers fall through the cracks).  Of course, one of the other
issues is that each driver that tries to handle this situation itself
does it in a different manner, and the correctness of those varying
implementations is also an issue to consider.
