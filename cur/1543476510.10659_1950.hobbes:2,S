If we don't do blocking system calls, we don't lose the CPU until our
time-slice is up.
Once you lose the CPU, you may lose it for N time slices because there
are N computable tasks that will get it before you get it back. This is a
multitasking operating system with many more tasks than just yours. You
get it CPU back when it's your turn, not the next timer-tick.
If N tasks are CPU bound, you sure want a long time-slice before the
CPU gets stolen from you.

Not accurate.
