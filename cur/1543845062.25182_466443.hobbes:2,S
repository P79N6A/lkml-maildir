It gets FRV to where it was at the point of 2.6.18 release.  Whether it 
worked on FRV at the time of 2.6.18 is quite a different question...
This recent push merely exposed _existing_ arch dependencies.  They 
aren't new by any stretch of the imagination.
As we see, the push has spurred relevant people into taking the correct 
action ;-)
