PCI interrupts should always be level triggered, not edge triggered 
(except maybe in a few special cases - non-native-mode PCI IDE maybe? 
and in those cases I don't think the interrupt is considered sharable). 
With a level triggered interrupt the ISR will simply be triggered again 
and the event handled in this case so there is no race. I think this 
patch is going to double interrupt overhead and only covers up some 
other problem.
I think that in cases where the interrupt is edge triggered and is 
shared (for example on ISA cards that support it) the kernel already has 
such logic as you describe.
