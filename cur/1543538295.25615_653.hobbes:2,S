There's NIPQUAD in the kernel, which pretty much does the same thing. Your
above version has an endianness problem though - all addresses are in
network order and you assume machine order. Macros that expand quietly
expand into four args are a bit too magic for my taste, but it's arguably
less magic than in_ntoa since the compiler will probably notice when you
use it wrong.
