No, because all symbols inside an "if FOO" block just means they
have a "depends on FOO". So other than saving some typing, it
does nothing. Well, perhaps it _ensures_ that all objects are
properly put _into_ the menuconfig. Some people get this wrong
and use "depends on FOO" inconsistently, leading to options
"falling" out of the menu, i.e. reappear at the parent menu.
