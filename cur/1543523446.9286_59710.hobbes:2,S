Some time in the last 48 hours, someone posted a very nice summary of what
the various GFP_* symbols mean when passed to kmalloc() -- unfortunately I
accidentally deleted that message.  And, I can't seem to find any archives
on the web.  Could someone please send the message to me please?

We've made a business out of making money from annoying and stupid people.
