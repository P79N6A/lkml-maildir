Hello!

Besides that, it works perfectly when you need to split load on servers
talking to enough large number of clients. Any http server is good example.

... and introduces even worse problem of strong tcp reordering.
Actually, experiments show that load balancing works only
in the situations, when congestion window is bounded by 3 packets.
If it is not made artificially, it occurs automatically on each
connection after some amount of excessive retransmissions.
Total single TCP connection throughput is never better in this case. 
Actually, it hints to the thought that "true load blalancing"
has to involve tracking connections and avoiding reordering TCP packets.
