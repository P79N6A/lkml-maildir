At least as a mount option, I'd definitely say it's worth it. I've lost count
of the times I've watched my box fsck huge partitions that it hadn't even
touched before the crash - not even for an atime update. 
When we mount a filesystem, do we currently wait until the superblock write is
flushed to the media, or do we just queue the superblock write and carry on as
if it's safe?
(If we don't flush the superblock write, what's to stop the block layer from 
reordering the writes, so we start writing the actual filesystem before the 
superblock write has hit the media?)
