gahh! don't put ...Office50/lib in ld.so.config! and don't set LD_LIBRARY_PATH
in your .profile or .bashrc, and don't tell other people to either! You only
want Star Office to look for libraries in a different place before trying the
regular system locations, but setting it up that way makes every executable on
your system try to find libs there too.
the problem, aside from the fact that it's an utter waste of time since no
executable but star office uses those libs, is that now all your executable will
find "libc.so.6" in there, and use that old version, and your shiny new libc you
just compiled with pgcc -O9 -march=amdk6 -fomit-frame-pointer is just sitting
there in /lib and /usr/lib getting utterly and completely ignored by most
programs
which, if you had really compiled it like that, would actually be why your box
kept running. :)
remove ...Office50/lib from /etc/ld.so.config, rm -f /etc/ld.so.cache and then
run ldconfig
that will correct your library search path.
then copy ...Office50/bin/soffice to /usr/bin
edit /usr/bin/soffice , *in here* set
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/Office50/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
personally I gutted the 'brains' out of the script too, and just explicitly set
the two or three variables it tries to set. This way only star office uses a
funky LD_LIBRARY_PATH
hint: many precompiled binaries need this. rvplayer,rmenc,pnserver (Real Audio),
netscape used to, etc...
cat /usr/local/bin/soffice

as you can see I still just have office 4, which needed libc.so.5.4.38
actually 5.4.33 through latest libc5 works, but 38 seemes to work the best.
this script will probably look about the same, you just have a different version
of libc sitting in ...Office50/lib
so, (this is to Alex) all that is requiered to run star office is an extra 5
megs of hard drive space taken up by two files, libc.so.6 and libm.so.6 sitting
in a directory where only star office will ever see/use them. since star office
is 150 megs, what's another 5?
I don't know why anyone reading this list needs directions for stuff like this,
but for those that don't know how to diagnose and treat a library dependancy,
http://www.waldherr.org/soffice/
 has always had the simplest boiled down
instructions for getting star office running since office 3
