I've just bought an ASUS P5B motherboard with an AMD K6-II 400MHz, and I'm
seeing some weird problems.
First, when I try to use /sbin/shutdown to reboot the machine, it properly
shuts everything down and starts to reboot, but it never makes it.  That
is, the screen goes blank and I can see the FDC and HDC reset (from das
blinkenlights), but I never see the video BIOS (a Diamond Viper V770) or
the memory test.  If I push the reset button on the case, it sometimes
works.  A full powercycle always works.
So, I checked for a BIOS upgrade.  And, there was one.  And, suprisingly,
according to ASUS, I need this upgrade to make the BIOS Y2K compliant.  (I
just bought this thing like 3 weeks ago, and it's not Y2K compliant?!?)  I
used their utility to flash the BIOS, and it seemed successful.  However,
when the kernel booted, it OOPSed when insmoding the module for the
Ethernet card (a Netgear 10/100 card).  The Oops was very consistant and
repeatable.  Downgrading the BIOS back to the old version seemed to the
Oops, but left me with a non-Y2K non-rebooting system.
Anyone have any idea what's going on?  This, BTW, is with a stock RH 6.0
distribution with all the latest updates as of today.
