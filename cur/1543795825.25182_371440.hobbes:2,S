From the source,
/*
   Transitions NUD_STALE <-> NUD_REACHABLE do not occur
   when fast path is built: we have no timers associated with
   these states, we do not have time to check state when sending.
   neigh_periodic_timer check periodically neigh->confirmed
   time and moves NUD_REACHABLE -> NUD_STALE.
   If a routine wants to know TRUE entry state, it calls
   neigh_sync before checking state.
   Called with write_locked neigh.
 */
I got the impression that neigh_periodic_timer is supposed to check
for stale entries although it doesn't. Which tasklet are you referring
to ? Or are you saying I should be calling neigh_sync instead of
checking for stale entries myself.
VMACS are used outside the linux system - for e.g. certain routers
present different VMACS for a default gateway ip for active-active
load-balancing and when one dies off, the failed VMAC is removed
eventually causing linux system using the failed VMAC to balk as it
doesn't stale out the arp cache entries even when traffic isn't able
to flow (confirmed doesn't move ahead).
netdev folks, can you CC me on your reply.
Thanks,
Pradeep Vincent
