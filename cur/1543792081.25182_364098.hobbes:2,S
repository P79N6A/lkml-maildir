Good question - I'm not sure currently.  In the places where set_irq_type
is used on ARM, we're mainly interested in setting the input according
to rising/falling edge or high/low levels rather than switching between
edge and level mode.
We could do as you suggest, but my concern would be adding extra
complexity to drivers, causing them to do something like:
	ret = request_irq(..., SA_TRIGGER_HIGH, ...);
	if (ret == -E<whatever>)
		ret = request_irq(..., SA_TRIGGER_RISING, ...);
The alternative is:
	ret = request_irq(..., SA_TRIGGER_HIGH | SA_TRIGGER_RISING, ...);
at which point the driver is telling the IRQ layer what it can support,
and allowing the IRQ layer to select the most appropriate type given
the driver and hardware constraints.
