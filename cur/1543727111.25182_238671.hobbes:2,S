sure: take a process that uses 85% of CPU time (and sleeps 15% of the
time) if running on an idle system. Start just two of these hogs at
normal priority. 2.6.8-rc2-mm2 becomes almost instantly unusable even
over a text console: a single 'top' refresh takes ages, 'ls' displays
one line per second or so. Start more of these and the system
effectively locks up.
unapply staircase-cpu-scheduler-268-rc2-mm1.patch and the same workload
becomes usable.
