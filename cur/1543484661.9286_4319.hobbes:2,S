Good work!
Now the kernel behaves as it shoud. dd running background can be hardly
noticed, with no impact on interactive feeling. Without this patch
the machine becomes useless within a couple of seconds.
I have tried it on a single machine (Pentium II, 328Mb)
so far, on monday I will make a torture test.
Thanks,
