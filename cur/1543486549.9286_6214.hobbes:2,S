There is something else we might need as well: Yielding to a specific
process.
The problem manifests itself in large threaded programs.  Say you have
a couple of hundred threads in a program.  In these programs, there
will always be some bottlenecks.  Locks surrounding malloc() is a
typical example.  Lots of processes will block trying to allocate
memory.  After the process that has aquired the lock releases it, all
the other processes will be waked up, leading to a "thundering
herd"-problem exactly like the one happening for networking
applications.  Now if we could yield explicitly to the first process
waiting for the lock, we would get acceptable performance again.
LinuxThreads seems to loose against FreeBSD user-land threads in this
regard.
