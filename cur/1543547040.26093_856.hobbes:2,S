   Due to another bug that I haven't isolated yet, the packets are
   actually received twice by tcpdump.
This is not a bug at all.  Over loopback, you will see the packet
twice because it is captured at two points 1) where it is transmitted
over loopback 2) where it is received over loopback, just as it would
be for ethernet transmit/receive.
This behavior is consistent with how every other interface captures
packets and it isn't going to change or be "fixed".
Later,
