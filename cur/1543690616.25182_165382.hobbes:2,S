I hit it too on a PS/2 Siemens keyboard, but surprisingly I could only
verify it with both windows keys on the right side of the keyboard (the
ones between altgr and ctrl). It has never happened with a 'regular' key.
It's not very frequent but I get it about once per day or so.
I use those keys to switch consoles, instead of using
alt + [left|right] arrow; and sometimes one gets stucked and scrolls the
consoles around until I press another key.
I'm pretty sure it's not the keyboard as it never happened in 2.4, and
it's been happening since 2.5.5X or .6X IIRC (in fact I think I posted
something about it).

Yes, it stops on any keypress or, if I'm running X, when it hits the X
console.

I have no idea, I really never thought about it but I'll put load and see
what I can find. 
Do you mean cpu load or some more complex vm load? (ie. I should "while
true; do true ; done" or "make -j bzImage" =)
Please let me know of anything else I can help you with.
Thanks,
