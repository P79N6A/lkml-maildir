Such (embedded) hardware uses a very small percentage of the drivers
we have in the tree, changing them as required seems quite sane and
manageable in 2.7.x time-frame.
I also do see why clock-less has to be embedded only, I suspect maybe
the s390 could make use of this too?  (Think of lots of mostly-idle
Linux instances under VM).
And, it's a 'new feature' so if people need to upgrade, then Life is
tough.  How sad.
