You mean the TIF->_TIF thing? Yes that was wrong in the first patch,
but fixed in the patches later. Unfortunately the patch still 
has the problem pointed out by Manfred Spraul: if you're unlucky
it could destroy the _TIF_SIGPENDING set by another CPU with the
non atomic access. Really thread_info should have two flag words:
one that is truly local and can be accessed without LOCK and 
one that can be changed at will by external users too.
After some discussion with him I think the right fix for now is to 
move it it back to PF_USEDFPU into task_struct->flags.
Will submit a patch for that later after I was able to test it.
