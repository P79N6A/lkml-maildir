The amount of people using 2.2/2.0 and SATA is probably small.
But sure, why dont you start the backport ?

This is not like "the rest of the feature sets", this is 
basic functionality needed to support new systems in the market.
And again, unfortunately not everyone is running v2.6 on their production
environment, yet.

Right, the old and lousy should wimper off and die. But this is 
a special case (a lot of people are applying SATA by hand, look at lkml).
