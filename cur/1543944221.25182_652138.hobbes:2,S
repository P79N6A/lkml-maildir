With your patch, the sound in headphone-out is working again, but surprisingly 
the integrated loudspeakers stopped working! ;)
Also, new on/of control appeared in alsamixer - "Speaker", but unmuting it 
(and unmuting all playback controls, plugging-out headphones) didn't have an 
effect on non-working integrated loudspeakers.
Some kernel mesgs with your patch:
hda_codec: Unknown model for ALC262, trying auto-probe from BIOS...
autoconfig: line_outs=1 (0x1b/0x0/0x0/0x0/0x0)
   speaker_outs=1 (0x14/0x0/0x0/0x0/0x0)
   hp_outs=1 (0x15/0x1b/0x0/0x0/0x0)
   mono: mono_out=0x0
   inputs: mic=0x18, fmic=0x19, line=0x0, fline=0x0, cd=0x0, aux=0x0
