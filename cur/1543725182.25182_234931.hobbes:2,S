I have an ethernet card with a DM9102AF chip.  It only works at 10 Mbps.
More precisely by using etheral on another box I see the frames it is
sending but it seems unable to catch the replies.  If I configure it 
to transmit at 10 Mbps then it works.
It happens both with 2.4 and 2.6 kernels.
The computer with the Davicom card is linked to the network through 
a switch.  The particualr cable and switch's port have worked 
perfectly with other cards.  Same thing for the network config;
Could be a thing about failing negotiation with the switch 
(as I saids the switch has worked perfectly with other cards).
Now the question is if negotiation is a hardware thing and there
is nothing to be done or a driver thing and then it should be
fixed
I have tried to link the card directly to another computer through a
crossed cable.    It worked but
I haven't checked at what speed the cards agreed to work.
I have tried the card in several computers: K6 with VIA chipset, PIII
with VIA chipset, P4 with Intel chipset.  Same results everywhere: card
doesn't work at 100 Mbps only at 10 Mbps
