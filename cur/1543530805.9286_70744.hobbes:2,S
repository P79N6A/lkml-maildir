   Gcc checks its memory allocations and exits if they fail. That clearly
didn't happen. The reason of course is that putting 0 into
/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory is darn close to a no-op. What you saw was
the effect of overcommitting memory. The "No memory for process xxx"
messages on the console could have told you that.
