It isn't non-existent, think of it as if you are asking the
device (which in this case is the devfs namespace) whether
there is an inode for a file named "0" in ./printer. devfs
knows that part of the tree is managed by module "printer",
which is an alias for whatever module to load. After trying
to load the module, either the node is there or isn't.
It seems you take issue with ANY dynamic FS.

It is unlike traditional Unix fses, but is that really that bad?
