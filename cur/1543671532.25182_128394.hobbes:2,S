Things that run in user space use the /usr/include headers.
Things that run in kernel space use the kernel includes.
If you think you need to violate these rules, you're either incorrect or
shouldn't be needing to ask.
(Having said that, if you're encountering a *specific* case where the difference
between the two sets of headers is *actually causing a problem*, feel free to
re-post and explain in detail what the issue is....)
