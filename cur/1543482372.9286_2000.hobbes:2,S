Hello, Sir/Madam:
I downloded and compiled the new linux kernel v2.2.0 successfully. But
when I reboot my machine with the new kenel (on a flopy disk, generated by
make zdisk command), the booting process stops at the following message:
kernel panic: VFS: Could nor mount root fs...
I don't know what wrong with it. Can any one help me?
Thanks!
Jia
