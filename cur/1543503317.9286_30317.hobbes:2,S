A bloke by the name of Jerry Breecher wrote something up on this back in the 
late eighties in one of the IEEE journals. I have the article floating about 
in paper form. Basically he just used standard old flat profiling data to 
reorganise the linking order, compared that to a number of other approaches 
(including profiling in the temporal domain) and discovered that it reduced 
the resident set size quite nicely for a lot of programs, with the associated 
benefits of less paging and possibly better cache locality. Profiler directed 
feedback has been around for ages in the MIPS camp (coord & pixie).
