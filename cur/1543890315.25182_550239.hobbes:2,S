After more contemplation, I now think I may have gone overboard here.  I 
am now of the opinion that any degradation of overall system performance 
due to the use of cpu affinity would be confined to the tasks with cpu 
affinity set.  So there's no need to prevent ordinary users from setting 
cpu affinity on their own processes as any degradation will only affect 
them.
So it goes back to the situation where you have to assume that they know 
what they're doing and obey their policy.

This idea is now not just bad but unnecessary.
