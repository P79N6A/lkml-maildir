Umm, but this is yee standard old interrupt probing - calling
probe_irq_on() and causing interrupts to be generated.
This seems to be something that these IRQ changes completely missed;
interrupt probing does not register interrupt handlers, so "retval"
in handle_IRQ_event will always be zero, and we'll always produce
these complaints.  I'm sure there's lots of other older drivers using
IRQ probing which are going to suffer in a similar way.
