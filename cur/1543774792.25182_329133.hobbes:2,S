Apparently your Python does not automatically look in /usr/local/lib/ 
python
and you don't have PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python.  Try adding the  
following
to your .bash_profile, then logging out and back in again:
if [ -z "$PYTHONPATH" ]; then
     PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python
else
     PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/lib/python"
fi
export PYTHONPATH
Cheers,

Somone asked me why I work on this free (
http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/
)
software stuff and not get a real job. Charles Shultz had the best  
answer:
"Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems? They do it
because life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't.  
That's why
I draw cartoons. It's my life."
