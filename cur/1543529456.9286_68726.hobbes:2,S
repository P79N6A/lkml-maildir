Subject: DEVFS: How to autoload modules?

I have read Richard Gooch's documentation, searched the archives,
but I don't understand how to work this.
Kernel is currently 2.3.49, compiling 2.3.51 right now...
From my .config:
CONFIG_DEVFS_FS=y
# CONFIG_DEVFS_DEBUG is not set
CONFIG_DEVPTS_FS=y
So.  I have SCSI cdroms (a regular and a cd-burner).  Neither comes
up upon boot as SCSI cdrom support is built as a module.  Richard's
documentation says you can just open /dev/sr and it'll autoload the
appropriate module(s).
I haven't found this true for my ide disks stuff, or cdroms or my
sound cards.  What do I need to do to get this working?
In a possibly relate thread of thought:  What exactly *is* the
format of the /etc/devfsd file?  I only want parts of the
compatibility stuff, not all of it, but I don't know what does what.
What is 'new' vs 'old' devfs?  I only just started, so I don't know.
What are the module.conf lines doing that Richard suggests adding?
I don't understand them, either.
I'll make a deal.  If someone explains this to me, I'll write up a
couple of sections for Richard's FAQ/Readme explaining this.
Ciao!
