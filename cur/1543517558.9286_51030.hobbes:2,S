_Rename_ the kernel structure, and move the kernel structure
into ipc/xxx.c.
old_user_semid_ds       -> semid_ds
user_semid_ds		-> new_semid_ds (*)
semid_ds	        -> sem_array [defined in ipc/sem.c]
(*) the glibc developers will rename the structure in their
header.

Message counts and sizes > 64 K are supported. I had to increase the
limit to 65535 because the DB/2 docu says that it needs a message size
of 65535, and supporting INT_MAX was straightforward ;)
