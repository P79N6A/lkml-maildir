Great, thanks. The HZ should make very little difference, except for slightly 
lower latencies as you increase the HZ.

Good. I obviously need to ensure that these remain well managed since I, for 
one, never want linux to suck on the desktop. In your case, I was more 
interested in your real world problems you were having so the rest of your 
report is even more important to me.

Thank you very much. I think you have nicely pointed out some of the real 
world advantages to this design. Those testcases are good for testing average 
latency, fairness, and consistency of both of them under various loads so 
they are excellent real world examples. If you extrapolate those facts to 
server loads you can understand how the fairness and latency can translate 
into advantages anywhere.

Thanks. I've already had a hundred or so people testing this code (thanks to 
the -ck mailing list people!) without any recent bugs prior to announcing it 
to lkml so I believe it is quite safe for testing.
