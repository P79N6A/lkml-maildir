	I'm sorry, but it *IS* actually a clever thing to
	intentionally break the interface whenever you make
	substantial changes to the inner gears of whatever programs
	you maintain.
	One could argue that changes to the API should be kept to a
	minimum (and I tend to agree with that), but if you do change
	the semantics of a software component, then you've got to
	break your own software to avoid having to chase unexpected
	bugs due to different semantics, whenever other components try
	to talk with the modified module.
	It's plain and simple and the core Linux maintainers know this
	very well -- and this may be the reason (note that I'm not
	actually saying that these were *the* reason) why we've had a
	major breakage of file systems: the semantics or functionality
	of the FS seem to have changed. So, there are now only a few
	file systems working (NFS, ext2, AFAIK).
	IMO, it is better to have software that does NOT work for a
	known reason (e.g., API change) than to have software that
	DOES work for an unknown reason.
	[]s, Roger...
