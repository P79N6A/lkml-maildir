The program fdisk does not know about Device-Mapper. It only reads and writes 
DOS partition tables, and leaves it up to the kernel block-layer to provide 
the corresponding block devices. Other tools are available that use the same 
partitioning format and work with Device-Mapper.

Yes. Software RAID devices are currently handled by the MD driver, but much of 
that functionality could be ported to Device-Mapper. RAID-linear and RAID-0 
can already be supported in DM, and the latest DM release from Sistina has a 
module to support RAID-1. So all that's left is to port the RAID-5 code to a 
DM module, and modify the user-space tools.
