I really appreciate the lot of -rcs, especially if there are so many 
intrusive changes/regressions. Like Andrew, I have a feeling that it 
gets buggier, but at least, it seems to be made up every ... two 
releases. 2.6.16 was a good one, .18, and .20. I suppose the 
bug/regression distribution between [2.6.16-2.6.17, 2.6.17-2.6.18] was 
biased like [70, 50]. About 2.6.21 - will see, rc has been to my liking.
Since a picture says more than a thousand words, have

(The last kernel to have only 5 -rcs was 2.6.14 - interesting)
Happy hacking,
Jan
