Yeah, that makes sense :(

Well, this will force the distros that are going to ship based on 2.6.25
(Fedora 9, openSUSE 11.0, etc.) to either enable EMBEDDED, or patch this
chunk out, as they do want to run with that option enabled because they
do have up-to-date userspace code.
It's as if we should just change the config option name every kernel
release to make sure that users keep things up to date.  So Ingo's
original proposal makes sense to me, more so than this patch.
