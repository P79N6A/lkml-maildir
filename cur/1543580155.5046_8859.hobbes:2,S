Subject: [PATCH] drivers/scsi/BusLogic.c: No resource probing before pci_enable_device (241p11)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi.
The following patch makes drivers/scsi/BusLogic.c wait with probing
pdev->irq and pdev->resource[] until we call pci_enable_device. This
is recommended due to hot-plug considerations (according to Jeff Garzik).
It applies against ac12 and 241p11.
Comments?
