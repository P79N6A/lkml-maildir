It depends a lot on the workload.
On a few workloads, the current VM explodes with as little as
16GB of RAM, while a few other workloads the current VM works
fine with 128GB of RAM.
This patch tries to address the behaviour of the kernel when
faced with workloads that trip up the current VM.

They seemed a reasonable balance between limiting the maximum amount
of work the VM needs to do and allowing pages the time to get referenced
again.  If benchmarks suggest that the ratio should be tweaked, we can 
do so quite easily.

Patch series like this can always use a good poking.  Especially by
people who run all kinds of nasty programs to trip up the VM :)
