Subject: [PATCH 08/11] uml: mark both consoles as CON_ANYTIME
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade@yahoo.it>
Since both UML consoles do not use percpu variables, they may be called when the
cpu is still offline, and they may be marked CON_ANYTIME (this is documented in
kernel/printk.c, grep for CON_ANYTIME to find mentions of this).
Works well in testing done with lock debug enabled, should be safe but is
not needed for next release.
This would probably help also stderr_console.c, but this is yet to test.
