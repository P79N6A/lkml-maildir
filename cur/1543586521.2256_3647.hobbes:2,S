Would it the case that bladeenc running on 2.4.2 spends more
time doing I/O?  I am not saying that the userland makes more I/O
requests, but if the same set of I/O requests are taking longer
to complete on 2.4.2, then while bladeenc is waiting for their
completion, it is not so surprising that the other process uses
the otherwise-idle CPU cycles.
