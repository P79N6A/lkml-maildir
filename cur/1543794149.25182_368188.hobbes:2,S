2.6.14-rt13 panics on my machine during the boot process. It gets to the
point where it loads my sound card, or just after (it goes by too fast
to tell), and then panics verbosely. You can see the .config, a terrible

There's nothing remarkable about it. All one has to do is hit the 
right keys at the right time and the instrument plays itself.
