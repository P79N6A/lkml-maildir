Exactly.
In the way we are moving naming policy out to userspace, you will be
able to specify exactly which disk, on which pci bus that you want to
boot from (remember initramfs will let us run userspace programs before
the boot disk is touched by the kernel.)
Yes, it still involves some handwaving at this moment in time, but it
will happen, and I do know about this requirement :)
