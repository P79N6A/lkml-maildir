I agree, but, under what rules?  Are there any?  I might even find some
time to help if I know the rules.
On the above problem, because of circular includes and the don't include
twice location, i.e. the whole file, not just the body (which circular
includes require) we often get the body of the file we are trying to
include below the actual body of the including file.
I also had a problem with the kgdb.h moving from 2.2.x to 2.4.x.  Seems
one of the include files started using typedefs for ints, you know, like
u32, etc.  This is fine my me, but PLEASE include the defining file(s). 
It should not be up to the user (even if he is a kernel jock) to sort
these things out!
