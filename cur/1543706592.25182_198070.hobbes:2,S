Subject: 2.6 PATCH : UFS2  filesystem support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi ,
I am trying to produce some patches to be able to
support UFS2 (of FreeBSD 5.x )  filesystem.
The work-in-progress patches are available from
http://ufs-linux.sourceforge.net/ufs2/p1.txt
http://ufs-linux.sourceforge.net/ufs2/p2.txt
Currently , these provides the bare minimum  ufs2
support and that also for Read-Only .
This is just a snapshot so several things simply may not work.
But atleast I was able to mount my ufs2 partition
(from a FreeBSD 5.2 install ) and read files.
Some testing will be good on them, though.
