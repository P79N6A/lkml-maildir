Hi Adolfo,
thanks a lot for the detailed and accurate report. Yes, this device would 
require a mapping quirk for the non-working keys. The endlessly repeating 
key might need something more sophisticated. I will look into your report 
and send you a patch to test in a few days. Currently, I am overloaded 
with other things, sorry.
Thanks,
