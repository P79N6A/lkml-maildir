With some in house code, on 2.4.14-pre8 I'm still getting some
unwanted swapping after filling up the cache that i'm not getting with
the 2.4.14-pre6aa1 kernel of a 4G system.  With pre8 if fills up the
memory with cache and does some minor swapping, on pre6aa1 it fills up
the memory with cache and happily works.
