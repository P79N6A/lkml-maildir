this issue is a bit different. The problem is that the irq warning
message (which is harmless) is printed from an atomic context. In the
next release i'll try something different: simply dont print to the
fbcon if the kernel is in an atomic context. This will reduce the
utility of fbcon when debugging kernel crashes, but it should avoid this
assert (and potential problems resulting out of it). Other types of
consoles (serial, text, netconsole) will still try to output everything,
independently of atomicity. (of these, only netconsole wants to
reschedule.)
