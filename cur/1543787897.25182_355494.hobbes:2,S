We'll need a bit more detail than that.
Please provide the entire crash dump message exactely as it is printed
on your screen.
Please provide as much of the bootup log as you can - using a serial
console or netconsole to capture boot messages may be a good option
(See the text files describing this in the kernel source
Documentation/ directory for details).
Please tell us the kernel version.
Please read the REPORTING-BUGS file in the kernel source dir (or use
this link: 
http://sosdg.org/~coywolf/lxr/source/REPORTING-BUGS
 ).

Irrelevant.
Not a kernel issue. Talk to the distribution people and/or the X
people about that.
