dmesg reports to me stuff like

It never used to complain at all.  This is an amd64 laptop, and related symptoms
include
 - kpowersave not being able to monitor the batter or AC adapter correctly;
   leading to catastrophes like laptop powering itself off with no warning,
   loss of work, filesystem needing log recovery, and so forth.
 - Serious fan action.  Recent kernels seemed to finally be doing sane things
   so that e.g. just editing text kept the CPU cool ... but now it's on almost
   all the time, CPU is very hot.
What's an AE_TIME?
I'm not quite sure where these problems crept in, but I never saw such stuff with
2.6.18 at all.
