Not really, everyone on the planet who cares is using the existing patch
and that just works. If the SCSI folks can't fix the SCSI layer to do
power management then the scsi drivers just need to not provide pm
methods until they catch up.
Blocking SATA suspend which people need for SCSI suspend which is
utterly obscure and weird is pointless, as pretty much ever vendor
except Red Hat has already decided.
