yeah, _some_ static markers are OK, as long as they are within a dynamic 
tracing framework! (and are thus constantly "kept in check" by the easy 
availability of dynamic probes)
what is being proposed here is entirely different from dprobes though: 
Roman suggests that he doesnt want to implement kprobes on his arch, and 
he wants LTT to remain an _all-static_ tracer. That's the point where i 
beg to differ: static markers are fine (but they should be kept to a 
minimum), but generic static /tracers/ need alot more than just a few 
static markers to be meaningful.
So if we accepted static tracers into the kernel, we'd automatically 
commit (for a long period of time) to a much larger body of static 
markers - and i'm highly uncomfortable about that. (for the many reasons 
outlined before)
Even if the LTT folks proposed to "compromise" to 50 tracepoints - users 
of static tracers would likely _not_ be willing to compromise, so there 
would be a constant (and I say unnecessary) battle going on for the 
increase of the number of static markers. Static markers, if done for 
static tracers, have "viral" (Roman: here i mean "auto-spreading", not 
"disease") properties in that sense - they want to spread to alot larger 
area of code than they start out from.
While if we only have a dynamic tracing framework (which is a mix of 
static markers and dynamic probes) then pretty much the only user 
pressure would be: "implement kprobes!". (which is already implemented 
for 5 major arches and takes only between 500 and 1000 lines of per-arch 
code for most of them.)
( furthermore, from what you've described it seems to me that 
  kprobes/kretprobes/djprobes+SystemTap is already more capable than 
  dprobes is - hence the number of static markes needed in Linux might 
  in fact be lower in the end than in Solaris. )

yeah, precisely my point.

yeah, agreed.
