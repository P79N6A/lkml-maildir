Well, IIRC, Alan and DaveM were essentially 1.2.x maintainers with various
-ac and "ISS" patches (bonus points if you can remember what ISS stood for).
I've probably got some of those 1.2.13 patches around somewhere...
As for 1.0.9, at one point some years ago I had updated it (cf. linux-lite)
to compile with "new" gcc-2.7.2  when RAM was major $$$ - I don't imagine
it has been touched since.
