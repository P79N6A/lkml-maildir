David,
Sorry for the delay, we've had email problems most of last week.
Yes, we can get rid of the early_serial_setup() in ev64260_setup.c, no
problem there.  I'm very busy on some other things right now but I'll try
to get to that soon.  If you can't wait, go ahead and make the change and
I will test it for you.
Mark
