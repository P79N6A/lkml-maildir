I do not remember name but I saw such utility somewhere...

Since this is big and complex task to transfer all userland from "root is god"
model to capabilities model perhaps ? Plus most daemons are not written
for Linux and thus do not support such scheme natively.

We do not have "Trusted Linux" (where UID 0 is just UID 0 and does not have
special power) yet, not even close. I know of no distrubution where such
work (reduce capabilities for only needed ones on daemon startup) is even
started.
