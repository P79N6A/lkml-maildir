whoa, big change.
What exactly are the semantics here?  If the process has actually been
killed (ie: we know that userspace won't be running again) then we break
out of a lock_page() and allow the process to exit?  ie: it's basically
invisible to userspace?
If so, it sounds OK.  I guess.  We're still screwed if the process is doing
a synchronous write and lots of other scenarios.
How well has this been tested?
Have the NFS guys had a think about it?
Why does it return -EIO from read() and not -EINTR?
