Please note that the use in HFS is inappriopriate. It's supposed to 
optimize the
read throughput there, which is something that shouldn't be done at the 
fs setup
layer at all. The usage of read_ahead there can be just removed and
everything should be fine (modulo the fact that in current state the HFS 
filesystem code
is just non-working obsolete code garbage anyway ;-).

Well if we do:
find ./ -name "*.c" -exec grep max_readahead /dev/null {} \;
One can already easly see that apart from ide, md, and acorn drivers 
this has been already abstracted
away one level up at the block device handling as well. My suspiction is 
that there is now already
*double* initialization of the sub-slices of this array there. Anyway 
ide should be adapted here to the
same way as it's done now for scsi.
Will you look after this or should me? (I can't until afternoon, becouse 
I'm at my "true live" job now
and have other things to do...)
