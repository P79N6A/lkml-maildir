The thing is here, this is PCIE, so if there is a GPU plugged into the
PCIE 16x slot in theory the main onboard graphics should disable, AGP
code is used to control the GART for the onboard chip, in this case a
plugged in card will  not use AGP, I wonder have Intel tested with a
pcie card in place...
