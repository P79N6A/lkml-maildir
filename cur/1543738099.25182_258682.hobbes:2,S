Subject: [2.6 patch] #include <asm/bitops.h> -> #include <linux/bitops.h>
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

There's no reason to directly #include <asm/bitops.h> since it's
available on all architectures and also included by
#include <linux/bitops.h>.
This patch (attached gzipped due to its' size) changes
#include <asm/bitops.h> to #include <linux/bitops.h>. It contains only 
the parts that apply cleanly to both 2.6.9-rc3-mm3 and 2.6.9-rc3 for 
making merging easier.
