The pagecache is a cache-per-inode.  So the cache for a regular file is not
coherent with the cache for /dev/hda1 is not coherent with the cache for
/dev/hda.

It will not.  And I doubt if it will make much difference anyway.  I once
wrote a gizmo which a) generated tables describing pagecache contents
immediately after bootup and b) used that info to prepopulate pagecache
with an optimised seek pattern after boot.  It was only worth 10-15%.  One
would need an intermediate step which relaid-out the relevant files to get
useful speedups.
