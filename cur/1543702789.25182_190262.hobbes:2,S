Linus just vehementally stated recently that partition parsing wouldn't 
be leaving the kernel :)
However, I do think we will eventually move to a middle ground, where 
partition parsing code will be in the kernel _source_ tree, but it will 
be in initramfs as you describe.
The reason being is that block device attachment and setup is growing 
more complicated over time, as people move to things like dm+lvm2+md or 
iscsi+dm+evms.  Thus, the support code to make those device combinations 
to be used as a root device will get more and more complex.
RAID and device mapper were actually two big reasons why I am pushing 
for klibc (pushed back to 2.7 now) and initramfs in the kernel source 
tree.  LVM, some EFI bits, dm, and md all have boot components are 
mainly in the kernel because they need to happen (a) early and (b) 
always, not because they actually need to be compiled into the kernel 
image itself.
