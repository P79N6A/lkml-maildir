I have seen behaviour similar to this (descibed in 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=98262067309185&w=2)
locally on a 2.4.X machine where the rsync completes but fails to
terminate, apparently because the child does not receive the KILLUSR1
(wild speculation)? Anyways, the parent process waits in wait4 and
the child loops, waiting for the signal. This is not reproducable
in 2.2.X (for me).
I have found that in order to reproduce this problem I need to
make rsync do a certain amount of work. Ie., rsync linux/drivers
new-dir will make rsync hang, but rsync linux/drivers/[a-p]* does
not. Does the same thing apply for you? stracing the rsync does
make it all work if I specify that rsync should trace the child,
too.
