i doubt you're going to get consensus on the *best* way to write this,
but it would be worthwhile to at least agree on the really *bad*
variations that shouldn't be used, the most vile one being:
  ret = whatever();
  if (ret) {
	...
  }
when there are no more references to "ret" inside the "if" construct,
which means there was no need to declare "ret" in the first place.
i'm guessing we can all agree on *that* but, beyond that, i think it's
going to be a matter of personal preference.
