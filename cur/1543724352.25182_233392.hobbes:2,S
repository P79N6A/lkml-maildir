Actually I need 7GB RAMDISK to use with my Caching
Drive Project. I have to use RAMDISK of 7GB or more
for the Caching purpose. The Architecture is like Disk
Caching Disk (DCD), but here I hav to use RAMDISK. 
I created RAMDISK using physical address as I hav
reserved all RAM above 1GB for my RAMDISK, but I am
not able to create RAMDISK of 7GB as a single Drive. 
Is there any Idea regarding this ????
