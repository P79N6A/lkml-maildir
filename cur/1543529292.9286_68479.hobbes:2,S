As for a good memory tester, try:

As for BP6 locking up, this is a know problem, propably not related to
Linux. For some, the new QQ bios seem to have fixed it. I can't say for
sure yet.

The lockups usually happen during long standing cpu load (possibly more
prone to fpu action), but sometimes they seem to happen with no reason at
all. I think vmware is completely unrelated (I've had it running perhaps
during one lockup, it was not running during the ~8 others.)
You can join linux-abit@geek.net mailing list to discuss bp6 issues,
