Doesn't make sense.  The kernel just tries all registered filesystems
for the rootfs until one clames it.  It means you either:
 - don't actually have ext3 in the kernel or
 - the filesystems actually is ext2 and not ext3
Try calling debugfs /dev/$ROOTDEVICE and then typing features, what does it
say?
