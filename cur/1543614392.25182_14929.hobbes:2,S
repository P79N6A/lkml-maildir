I don't know if this has something to do with your problem, but
bugs.debian.org has a _long_ list of reported bugs for ssh, many of them
with respect to ssh's X-forwarding.
My own experience with Debian's ssh is that, sooner or later,
X-forwarding fails, with Send-Q (or Recv-Q) in the server side
completely full. The server side was Debian Sid, and client side was
Debian Woody, and it happened with both a simple xclock and gkrellm (ssh
remoteserver xclock, ssh remoteserver gkrellm).
However, interactive shells didn't seem to show this problem.
