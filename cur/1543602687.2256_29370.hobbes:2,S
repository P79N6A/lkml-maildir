I stopped on 2.4.6, using it from its release, and it seems rock-stable
to me - it was with p75 (amd k5 133mhz) with 32mb ram, sometimes under
really HEAVY load with all memory full; infinite loop consuming
all the memory ;), now with amd k6 singing in the rythm of 500mhz,
and w/o any problems. It is used as my desktop machine (bunch
of vims, sometimes even X+wm) and as the server (binds, postfix/qmail,
apache..) as well. If you aren't doing unusual things on exotic hardware
(ok, via soundcard driver has a problems ;), you should be happy with
this.. The last mainstream kernel with sane vm :-).
