Most new laptops are moving away from PS/2 ports, for example my
shining (literally) new Acer Ferrari 4005 only has USB2 ports for mice
and keyboard inputs (unless in the optional pcie docking station maybe).
So my suggestion would be to fix USB power management.
The mouse that comes with the ferrari 4005 is actually a bluetooth
mouse, but for some reason it is the worst thing I've ever used.
So, what I'm currently using is a usb -> ps/2 converter. I can't imagine
this to be any good for power consumption at all.
(OT:Bad mouse)
-It will overcharge battery so the whole mouse becomes HOT
-Occasionally it will stop working for ~5sec
-The optical sensor takes a while to focus on the pad when lifted and
 put down again.
BTW: The laptop itself is _really_ good, just the mouse is a total
     failure.
