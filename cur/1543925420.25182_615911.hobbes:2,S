hm, kprobes and gdb support.
ho hum, I've seen worse-looking code ;).  There's quite a bit of the usual
stuff in there: use of SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED, a forest of fishy-looking
volatiles, but I don't need to sit here and emulate checkpatch.pl.
I googled a bit but most of the mn10300 info pertains to linux kernel and
gcc.  Who is using this CPU and in what applications?
