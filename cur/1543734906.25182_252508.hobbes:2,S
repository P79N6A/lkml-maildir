I don't see deterministic execution time of hardirqs/softirqs happening
on stock hardware and without serious driver work, and I don't see much
hard RT ever happening on SMP due to lock contention. But maybe that
just means it's difficult.

One reason I'm not complaining is because voluntary switching is
required to reschedule in otherwise non-preemptible critical sections.

Well, one thing that completely voluntary context switch -based
critical section management tells us that reliance on implicit kernel
preemption doesn't is which codepaths matter: whatever codepaths would
need to be preempted implicitly then explicitly show up as latency
blips on the latency instrumentation radar screen, and by so doing at
least get annotated with "this codepath matters for latency" and
whoever may inadvertently try to extend a nonpreemptible critical
section over the scheduling point will have a big "stop" sign in front
of them.  So, even if CONFIG_PREEMPT is the way and the annotations are
nops there, the annotation of latency-critical scheduling points, even
where they would be preemptible with CONFIG_PREEMPT=y, has value.
And, of course, the preemption reenablement required for voluntary
yielding from non-preemptible critical sections also has a positive
operational effect with CONFIG_PREEMPT=y, so there is nothing in VP
that doesn't also benefit CONFIG_PREEMPT.
