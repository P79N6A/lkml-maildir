It isn't when you are not using persistent super blocks, and if it were 
doing so that would definitely be a bug IMO.
And anyway, it occurs without using the md driver as well (on a normal 
partition as I described in my original post...).
Andries Brouwer's reply/post offered the AFAICS correct explanation that 
the last sector (512b sector size) on partitions with an odd number of 
sectors cannot be accessed at present due to the 1kb block size of the kernel.

Anton
