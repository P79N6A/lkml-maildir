It is for user-space developers who include headers for the ksyms
prototypes. It works to permit them to use gcc -ansi and -pedantic if they
wish. I recommend that for producing maintainable and portable code.
$ info gcc;
for reasons to use __inline__. I didn't invent that macro, you know. The
majority of kernel headers used it to start with.

Who's going to put the revisions into gcc-2.7.2?

Yes, I think that may need to be handled, perhaps by something like:
#ifdef _GNUC_
extern
#endif
I'm open to suggestions on that.

Who said anything about altering kernel mechanisms for this?
I think you haven't followed the discussion that produced these patches. I
would have turned off the religious war too, if I hadn't got involved as an
innocent agnostic.
