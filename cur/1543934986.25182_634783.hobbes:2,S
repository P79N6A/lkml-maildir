Maybe it is not obvious that I maintain this driver and would like to be
kept on Cc:.  Will send a patch to fix that shortly.

Not for me.  I don't mind if you keep such a hack until a proper
solution if found in your private tree.  But it is a horrible solution
to a problem introduced elsewhere.
Ingo, Peter, does either of you actually care about this problem?  In
the last round when I debugged this problem there was a notable lack of
reaction from either of you.
