Been around forever and a day. RedHat getty's clear the screen, which tends to 
remove the unscrollable region that the logo sits in. Debian doesn't, so it's 
much more noticable (and always has been).
This might be best done thru userspace, as having the logo and other graphics 
sitting at the top of the screen through the boot process (eg: sysv init 
scripts, etc) within an unscrollable region can be useful. I know that the 
boot-icons package in Debian actually relies on this behaviour. Perhaps you 
could provide an option in the kernel config to change this default 
behaviour, for those that want it?
If it's possible to unlock this region so that it scrolls again from userspace 
(ie: not resetting/clearing it, just unlocking it), then it's just a simple 
matter of checking wether the current console is an fb device, and if it is, 
making it unlock the scrolling region. In Debian, this could be done 
in /etc/init.d/rmnologin, or even in /etc/profile if someone would rather it 
done after login.
