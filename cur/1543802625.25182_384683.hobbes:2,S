Hi Ingo,
While trying to exploit the race in the hrtimer code in your kernel
(still unsuccessful), I found a bug that I introduced with the
wait_on_softirqd patch.   The wake_up is called within preempt_disable,
and thus might schedule and cause a bug output.  I've uploaded my latest
with the fix for this.
