These are general Dell laptop problems, and so far as I can tell, there's 
no solution yet to either.  Audio is quite hard (except to get apps to use 
bigger buffers; try googling for 'hammerfall cardbus dell', it's a common 
problem).
This page:
http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-hw2.html
may contain a solution to the audio issue, too, I just discovered.
The clock problem is something Linux should deal with.  Like to look into 
it?  I can help somewhat.
