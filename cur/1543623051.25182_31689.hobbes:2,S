I'm pretty sure Andrew realizes this.  I can see two valid complaints,
1) you don't need ugly ifdefs in the code itself -- define a no-op
static inline function for when !VLAN
2) IIRC Alan or somebody is trying to get rid of CONFIG_xxx_MODULE,
because it doesn't really cover the case of when somebody builds VLAN
"later on" as a module, but disables it initially.
