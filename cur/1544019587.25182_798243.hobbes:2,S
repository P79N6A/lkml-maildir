Subject: [PATCH 085/114] x86: disable Voyager temporarily
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/28/570

x86/Voyager does not build right now and it's unclear whether it will
be cleaned up and ported to the subarch-less 32-bit x86 code - so disable
it for now.
If it's fixed we'll re-enable it - or remove it after some time. There's
a very low number of systems running development kernels on x86/Voyager
currently. (one or two on the whole planet)

 	  Voyager is an MCA-based 32-way capable SMP architecture proprietary
