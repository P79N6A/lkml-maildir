This got me to take a non-casual look at that particular git commit.  The
first portion of the change log description says perfectly about the intent,
but after studying the code, I have to say that the actual code does not
implement what people say it will do.  In recalc_task_prio(), if a task's
sleep_time is more than INTERACTIVE_SLEEP, it will bump up p->sleep_avg all
the way to near maximum (at MAX_SLEEP_AVG - DEF_TIMESLICE), which according
to my calculation, it will have a priority bonus of 4 (out of max 5).
IOW, for a prolonged sleep, a task will immediately get near maximum priority
boost. Is that what the real intent is?  Seems to be on the contrary to what
the source code comments as well.
I think in the if (sleep_time > INTERACTIVE_SLEEP) block, p->sleep_avg should
be treated similarly like what the "else" block is doing: scale it proportionally
with past sleep time, perhaps not the immediate previously prolonged sleep
because that would for sure bump up priority too fast.  A better method might
be p->sleep_avg *= 2 or something like that.
