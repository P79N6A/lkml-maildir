Dave, we've been thinking about this some more and have concluded
that since the problem is a relatively non-fatal one, the kernel
should just print out an "assertion failed" error similar to the
one in tcp_input.c, line 1323 [BUG_TRAP(cnt <= tp->packets_out);]
and maybe fix things up a little rather than oops on a NULL pointer
dereference;  The state in question, although invalid, is possible
and should IMHO be checked for as in all the other "if (skb != NULL)
..." places).
What do you think?  We keep on trying to locate which code is causing
the corruption, meanwhile the affected system has been running crash-lessly
with the attached patch.
Thanks,
