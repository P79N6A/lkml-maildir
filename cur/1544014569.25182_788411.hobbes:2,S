Patches to do so are gladly welcome, but it might be a bit difficult as
spelunking through old distros isn't exactly the most fun thing to do :)
In short, any distro released in 2008 is fine, for 2007, you should also
be fine, but you might want to be safe.  anything older than that, you
should set this value to Y.
