It'd be nice for it to be normal enough to go tristate, but there isn't
going to be any effort expended directly to that end. Might as well
remove the exit function. Probably mostly pointless to try to avoid
panicking, but I'd not bother with new panics as a simplification just
because panicking is somewhat rude.
