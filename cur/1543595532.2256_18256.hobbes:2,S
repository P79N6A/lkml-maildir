ignore that.  You can sleep in remove, and it will not be called from
interrupt context.

if someone yanks the card, how is it going to deliver an interrupt to
the CPU?

huh?  what are you talking about?  oops or random memory corruption
occurs.  there is no consensus necessary.
If you are worried about unregister_framebuffer failure, then don't
deallocate the memory, or sleep until unregister_framebuffer succeeds,
or any one of a number of workarounds.
