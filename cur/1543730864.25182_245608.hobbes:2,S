it doesn't work, even with these two patches applied. I tried to burn
a DVD image (3.5GB) with kernel 2.6.8.1 including those patches and
again the memory run full until the kernel started killing processes.
Unfortunately the host always crashes before it writes the messages
to the log files, but I saw some messages about "cpu0..." and DMA.
I was running "cdrecord -sao dev=ATAPI:/dev/cdrecorder -v 2.4.img"
on a NEC ND1300A.
Can I debug/provide more info?
BTW, the bio.c from 2.6.9rc1 and 2.6.8.1 don't differ, so I assume it's
still unfixed in 2.6.9-rc1, too...?
cu,
Frank
