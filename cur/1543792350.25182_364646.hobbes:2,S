although if the primary workload is short-lived tasks and you don't do 
balance-on-fork/clone won't you have trouble ever balancing things? 
(anything that you do move over will probably exit quickly and put you 
right back where you started)
at the risk of a slowdown from an extra test it almost sounds like what is 
needed is to get feedback from the last scheduled balance attempt and use 
that to decide per-fork what to do.
for example say the scheduled balance attempt leaves a per-cpu value that 
has it's high bit tested every fork/clone (and then rotated left 1 bit) 
and if it's a 1 do a balance for this new process.
with a reasonable sized item (I would guess the default int size would 
probably be the most efficiant to process, but even 8 bits may be enough) 
the scheduled balance attempt can leave quite an extensive range of 
behavior, from 'always balance' to 'never balance' to 'balance every 5th 
and 8th fork', etc.

even though people will point out that it's a brin-dead workload (that 
should be converted to a state machine) I would expect that most 
fork-per-connection servers would show problems if the work per connection 
is small
