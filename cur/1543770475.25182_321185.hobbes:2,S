I'm not sure.
The thing is, right now git allows binary commit messages if somebody
really wants to. Now, a lot of the _tools_ end up only printing up to the
first '\0' or something, but in general, maybe somebody actually wants to
embed his own strange stuff in there (eg use encryption but still use
standard git tools).
Which makes me worry. So I _do_ do whitespace cleanup in my "apply email 
patches" scripts, but I'm not sure whether the core should care about the 
data that people feed it, even for commit messages.
Opinions?
