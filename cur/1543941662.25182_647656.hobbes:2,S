FWIW with my distributor hat on I think File system capabilities are very nice 
and enables one to ship a distribution with a small set of setuid binaries.
On the other hand for per-process securebits, it would be nice to see a 
complete example how it could be applied to a setuid program. That would be a 
nice step in moving forward.
