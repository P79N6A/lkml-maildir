But it's not minimal. Maybe it was long ago when the code was designed
on a 3c509 but not with modern hardware: Think interrupt mitigation and NAPI. 
And with NAPI we tend to process the packets directly after they
are fetched out of the RX queue, so there is practically no delay
between driver seeing the packet and softirq seeing it.  All the queuing
is done either at hardware level or later at socket level.

That would be fine too (because it will be likely fast), but unfortunately
I don't know of any driver that does that.
