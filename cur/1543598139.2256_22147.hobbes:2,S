The problem with suspend actually turned out to be because the APIC is
unconditionally enabled _before_ the command line is scanned and the 'noapic'
option is detected. The noapic option, however, does have the effect of
preventing the registration of the power management code :)
Booting with 'apic' makes the thing take some time to suspend, and then 
it reboots instead of resuming. That may be your case (b). I put printk in 
the apic suspend and resume functions and neither of them seem to appear.
