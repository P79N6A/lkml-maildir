Well please propose the virtio API first and then I'll adjust the PCI 
ABI.  I don't want to build things into the ABI that we never actually 
end up using in virtio :-)

I was thinking more along the lines that a hypercall-based device would 
certainly be implemented in-kernel whereas the current device is 
naturally implemented in userspace.  We can simply use a different 
device for in-kernel drivers than for userspace drivers.  There's no 
point at all in doing a hypercall based userspace device IMHO.

It's pretty invasive.  I think a more paravirt device that expected an 
edge triggered interrupt would be a better solution for those types of 
devices.

None of the PCI devices currently work like that in QEMU.  It would be 
very hard to make a device that worked this way because since the order 
in which values are written matter a whole lot.  For instance, if you 
wrote the status register before the queue information, the driver could 
get into a funky state.
We'll still need save/restore routines for virtio devices.  I don't 
really see this as a problem since we do this for every other device.

You also at least need a num argument which takes you to 48 or 64 
depending on whether you care about strange formatting.  8 queues may 
not be enough either.  Eric and I have discussed whether the 9p virtio 
device should support multiple mounts per-virtio device and if so, 
whether each one should have it's own queue.  Any devices that supports 
this sort of multiplexing will very quickly start using a lot of queues.
I think most types of hardware have some notion of a selector or mode.  
Take a look at the LSI adapter or even VGA.
