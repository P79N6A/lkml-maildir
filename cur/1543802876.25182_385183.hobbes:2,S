Ok, but I think I'll rename existing variables in separate patch.

This scales the time_offset value so that later at every tick you add 
only (time_offset >> SHIFT_HZ) and after HZ ticks time is changed by 
time_offset and so makes the crude compensation later completely 
unnecessary.

This part will change at some point anyway, when tick_nsec_curr/ 
time_adj_curr are merged to a single 64 bit value, until then I prefer to 
keep it a bit more verbose, but also a bit more efficient.
