Half of the cards without ALSA drivers are ancient PC hardware and the 
other half are drivers for !i386 platforms.
Me scheduling other OSS drivers for removal brought me indirectly in
contact with two users of SOUND_TRIX and one user of SOUND_VIDC - and 
I'd assume that most of such hardware has some users somewhere.
I don't consider it a big problem if a handful OSS drivers for obscure 
hardware will stay forever (although getting ALSA drivers for all 
hardware would be the superior solution).
We are already able to both remove a serious amount of code and getting 
many bug reports against the ALSA drivers without removing support for a 
single piece of hardware.
