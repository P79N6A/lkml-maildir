Right.  We can do that as well. In practice in working code
there is no real difference.
There is a little extra uniformity in rolling it ourselves, but
not enough to worry about either way.
In the review/debug etc cycle it just wound up being a lot easier
to roll the code myself.
By the time we get to lookup_one_len_kern it is almost impenetrable
code in namei.c where sysfs_add_dentry tends is easier to comprehend,
and to modify for debugging.
