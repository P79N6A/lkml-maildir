Suspend-to-disk has a few advantages over suspend-to-ram: 
With suspend-to-disk I can remove the battery (to put in a fresh
battery when traveling), try doing that with suspend-to-ram.  It's
also really useful for my moving my old Thinkpad which has a battery
which is so bad it can't even hold power for suspend-for-ram for more
than a few seconds.
With suspend-to-disk I can suspend Linux, resume Windows to be able to
run that one program I have to run under Windows, suspend Windows and
resume Linux again without having to restart alla applications.
And yes, this have been very useful for me in real life.  So it's
really nice to have both suspend-to-disk and suspend-to-ram.
