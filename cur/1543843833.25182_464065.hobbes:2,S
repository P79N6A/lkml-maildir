Plese dont put words into my mouth. No, i dont assume they are mutually 
exclusive, did i ever claim that? But i very much still claim what my 
point was, and which point you disputed (at the same time also insulting 
me): that even if hell freezes over, a static tracer wont be able to 
extract 'x' from the MARK(event, a) markup. You accused me unfairly, you 
insulted me and i defended my point. In case you forgot, here again is 
the incident, in its entirety, where i make this point and you falsely 
dispute it:
