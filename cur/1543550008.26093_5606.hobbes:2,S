If the expression (from fs/Makefile)
subdir-$(CONFIG_NLS)	+= nls
evaluates to
subdir-y		+= nls
and mod-subdirs contains "nls"
both-m         := $(filter $(mod-subdirs), $(subdir-y))
SUB_DIRS       := $(subdir-y)
MOD_SUB_DIRS   := $(sort $(subdir-m) $(both-m))
will add nls to both SUB_DIRS and MOD_SUB_DIRS.
The two examples just don't belong together.
