The PCI9050 LAS0RR local configuration register
controls whether the address range is marked
prefetchable or not. If bit 3 is set, then the range is marked as
prefetchable in Bit 3 of PCI configuration register BAR2.
I would verify that the EEPROM attached to the PCI9050 is setup
to program the LAS0RR bit 3 to zero to mark the address range
as *not* supporting prefetch.
