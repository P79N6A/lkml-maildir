Note that in order to support more reliable allocation of
contiguous memory areas (eg. for loading modules) we may
also want to add some simple form of defragmentation to
the VM.
If you really want to make life easy for the VM, ->writepage()
should work towards making the page it is called for freeable.
You probably want to do this since an easy VM is good for
performance and it would be embarrasing if reiserfs had the
worst performance under load simply due to bad interaction
with other subsystems...
kind regards,
Rik
