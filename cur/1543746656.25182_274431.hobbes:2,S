Yes, sorry. I'm confusing initrd/ramfs support with modules. You can
resume from an initrd/ramfs without building as modules.
Regardless, building support as modules does have the other advantages
noted above, and I haven't found adding support for building as modules
to be a pain at all.
Sorry again for confusing the issue.
