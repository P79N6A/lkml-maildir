It's logical that PageDirty should never be get for ramfs, and a ramfs
page should never have buffers on it.  With this and Chris's anon_space
mapping can we replace the check for null ->writepage with BUG?  With
the anon_space mapping we should be able to do the same ford for
->mapping.
Though these things aren't strictly bugs, having to check multiple paths
for everything is slowing us down in picking off the fluff.
