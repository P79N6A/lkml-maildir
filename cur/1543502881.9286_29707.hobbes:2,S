Okay, I'm beginning to notice a trend here... would people be happier if
I gave you a patch that did this "process clustering" thing I keep
mentioning?  I despise the idea, and I still think it's a lot cleaner to
do it the normal way... but it wouldn't be any trouble to do both.  If I
understand Larry correctly, though, I don't think that would placate his
objections. :(
Comments here?

That would be me (disagreeing, that is).  IMVHO we'd be better off just
screwing POSIX altogether than pretending to support it, only to disagree
on points like this.  We either support POSIX, or not, and "almost"
supporting standards has already caused enough grief by commercial
companies who have an incentive to tell lies like that.  We don't have to
do so as well.
