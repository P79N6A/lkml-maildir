Its a known problem. There are two approaches. Either rewrite the ide
scsi reset code to use ide_abort infrastructure or switch ide-scsi back
to the old abort/reset code not new_eh and use SCSI_RESET_PUNT so that
the recovery is all handled by the ide layer.
For 2.4 the latter may be the best approach, for 2.5 it has to use
new_eh
