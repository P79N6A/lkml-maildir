	I don't currently use bugzilla (just due to inertia), but the
whole world doesn't have to switch to something overnight in order for
that facility to end up saving more time and resources than it has
cost.  Adoption can grow gradually, and it's probably easier to work
out bugs (in bugzilla) and improvements that way anyhow.
