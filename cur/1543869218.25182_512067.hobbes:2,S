No, it doesn't. I've tried all the methods from 640x480 to 1600x1200,
and they /all/ come up snowy. This is starting to look queerer and
queerer. I've also tried changing vf min and max as you suggested:

and even the M and MR methods which you suggested in the other email.
Since nvidiafb is being loaded from the command line because it's a
blacklisted module otherwise, I've been using the mode_option option.
However, neither the mode_option nor fbset seem to give me anything
not snowy.
Damn.
