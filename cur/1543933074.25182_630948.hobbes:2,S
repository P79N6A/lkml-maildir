Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

The 
http://www.kerneloops.org
 website collects kernel oops and
warning reports from various mailing lists and bugzillas as well as
with a client users can install to auto-submit oopses.
Below is a top 10 list of the oopses collected in the last 7 days.
(Reports prior to 2.6.23 have been omitted in collecting the top 10)
This week a total of 100 oopses have been collected, up from 59 last week.
(This does not mean that the kernel quality has gone down; rather it means
that there's more effective data collection)
