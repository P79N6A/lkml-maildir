The kernel interface is sysfs and hotplug.
Udev interfaces that and can be set up so that it assigns
/dev/cdrecorder0, 1, ... to evey recorder in the system, implementing
the userspace interface.
HAL interfaces the above and implements the desktop interface.
So for a GUI application it's appropriate to use HAL, while a command
line program doesn't need any enumeration, as 'ls /dev/cdrecorder*'
should be enough for an experienced user.
