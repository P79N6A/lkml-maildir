Semantic quibbling, trying to paper over stupidity.
It doesn't really matter if it's a "console driver" or "the console device
itself".  If you're in modprobe loading *any* piece of "all the stuff needed
to make open("/dev/console") work", the last thing you want to be doing
is opening /dev/console to complain about something not working.
As Alan said several times now, there really *is* a requirement that early
userspace has its act together.
