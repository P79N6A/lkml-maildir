You can only do that if the cowid object has a pointer to the last
remaining reference to it.  That's possible, but more complicated and
would incur a little more I/O per cow operation.

fsck could do it.  It's not a big deal though: simply looking up the
inode through the last remaining path can also clean it up.  Until
them, it's very little space used: the same as a short symlink.
