I forget what the output from modprobe said.  But I had 
cpufreq.debug=7.  Here are the logs:

Okay.  I understand the distinction between what the processor supports 
and what the motherboard exports via the ACPI tables.  I do still want 
to know what C states the E6600 supports.  Does anyone know?  Also, I've 
heard the it's possible to modify the DSDT on boards to add interfaces 
to processor features that the board does not provide.  Of course this 
is a dead end if E6600 doesn't support these low power states to begin 
with.  Assuming it does, does anyone know if it's possible to get them 
working on the Asus P5B Deluxe?
