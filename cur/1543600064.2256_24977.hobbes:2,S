I see.  Instead of checking the interrupt flag in in_irq(), spin_lock_irq
could also simply increment the local_irq_count, just like spin_lock_bh
increments the local_bh_count.

This would definitely solve the deadlock in our case.  However, I'm not
sure this doesn't have some adverse effect on other code; e.g. there are
quite a few routines that use if (!in_interrupt()) as a bug-check, and
some might possibly be called from inside a spin_lock_irq ...
