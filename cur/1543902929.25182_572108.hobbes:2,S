During debugging, I noticed that dev_queue_xmit() is called twice for tx vlan frames. This results in a frame being passed twice to a packet socket bound to 'any' interface. If the packet socket is bound to a specific interface, though, it will get only one copy of the tx frame, which is good.
In more detail: suppose we're tx'ing a frame, and the route table lookup yields a vlan outgoing device eth0.2. dev_queue_xmit() is called, which calls dev_queue_xmit_nit() for dev = eth0.2 then dev->hard_start_xmit() for dev = eth0.2. 
The latter call gets into the vlan layer, which attaches the vlan id 2 (accelerated or not... in my e1000 case accelerated) then calls dev_queue_xmit() again. This time around dev_queue_xmit_nit() is called for dev = eth0, and dev->hard_start_xmit() actually calls the ethernet driver.
The net result is that dev_queue_xmit_nit() is called twice, once for dev=eth0.2 then for dev=eth0.
