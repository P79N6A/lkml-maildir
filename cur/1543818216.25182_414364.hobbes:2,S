Will this dump text segments that have been COW'd for the purposes of
inserting a breakpoint?
It's just a question of goals, I guess.  We could dump code, but it's
rarely useful, so historically we didn't.  Similarly, we could dump
mapped data from shared memory, but it can be huge and is rarely
useful, so generally we don't.
