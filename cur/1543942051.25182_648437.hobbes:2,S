ROFL! Well, since a lot of screwdriver types are easily available, I 
don't think a judge could agree with 'em...

Well, then why close the driver? Simply place the check in the firmware. 
Much harder to find, since it have to run on proprietary HW. The OS 
driver instead runs on standard (and usualli well-known) HW.
Keeping the screws similitude, closing the driver is more like using a 
Torx, while placing checks in the FW is more like using a lock-only 
screw (already seen some)...

Well, we all agree on this... Now we just have to make THEM agree, too...
