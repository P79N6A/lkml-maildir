Done that, rebuilt and rebooted...
/dev/hda and /dev/hdb (old driver) are gone... 
OK, rebooting again, with a new root device as /dev/sde1...
No problem for the old IDE devices, they are now /dev/sdX.
But the Jmicron stuff is still broken though no more conflict :(

Also, I've seen a :
ata1: Spurious SDB FIS during NCQ issue=0x0 SAct=0x7ff8001f
FIS=004040a1:00040000
What's this ? Is it really bad or just a warning ???

Paul
