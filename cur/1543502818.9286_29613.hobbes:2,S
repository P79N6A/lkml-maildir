Subject: 2.2.10-ac4/8 : eth0 not initializing after fsck at bootup

Hello,
I have a very reproductible problem in the following situation :
with kernel 2.2.10-ac4/8 (maybe ac10, not tried yet), when a
fsck occurs at system boot ("maximum mount counts reached, forcing
fsck" [or similar], or when the system had to be rebooted with
the little button), network initialization stops on eth0 (I let
the system the whole night stuck on 'initializing eth0').
CTRL-ALT-DEL reboots properly, et the system comes up correctly after
a few minutes.
I have the problem at home (DEC 21140 based NIC) and at work (Epic 100).
Configuration : PII 400 UP or K6 2/3D 300 UP with 128 Mo, RH 6.0,
100 Mbits/s ethernet card, kernel 2.2.10-ac4 or 2.2.10-ac8.
Has anyone seen that ?
A+,
