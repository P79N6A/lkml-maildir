What Matt and Ted are looking at is the question 'are flash devices close enough 
to other block devices that it would make sense to change the existing linux 
definition of a block device to handle the special requirements of flash'
if the block device layer can be reasonably modified to accomodate flash, then 
doing so greatly improves flexibility and maintainability. It would also reduce 
the overall code size since existing features of the block layer (for example 
snapshots) would not need to be duplicated or re-written for the flash block 
layer.
if not then so be it.
everyone understands that flash has different requirement from a hard drive as a 
block device, what isn't clear to the people reading this thread (and reviewing 
the code) is why you believe that it is _so_ different that it's impossible to 
consider extending the linux definition of a block device.
the fact that the native eraseblock size is significantly larger isn't a factor.
the fact that you erase in large blocks and then write in smaller blocks is a 
difference, and one that the current block layer doesn't understand. but this is 
a difference that the current block layer could be changed to understand. it's 
not something that would justify a seperate-but-equal block layer for flash 
devices.
as Ted notes, the idea that block sizes may not be powers of 2 (128k-128b from 
his e-mail) _may_ end up being a big enough difference that it's not worth 
teaching the exising block layer how to deal with, but it's not clear why you 
are useing this odd size.
this is why you are being asked for further explinations.
