You need to use iommu=soft swiotlb=force
The standard IOMMU is also broken on VIA, but forced swiotlb should
work.
However it is a bit slow because it will force all IO through an
additional copy.
If it helps I can do a proper patch that only bounces IO > 4GB through
the copy.

We can probably get it to work, but you're clearly outside validated
territory (= you're running the hardware in a untested by the vendor
configuration). Normally that's not a good idea.
BTW there are NForce systems with similar problems, but they are
rare.
