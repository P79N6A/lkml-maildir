How can't you get the fact that semaphores could _never_ be as simple as 
mutexes?  This is a theoritical impossibility, which maybe turns out not 
to be so true on x86, but which is damn true on ARM where the fast path 
(the common case of a mutex) is significantly more efficient.
Semaphores _require_ an atomic decrement, mutexes do not.  On some 
architectures that makes a huge difference.

No one disagrees with that.

The very point is that mutexes will always have a speed advantage by 
nature.

I spent the whole week making that demonstration repeatedly.  Why are 
you ignoring me?
