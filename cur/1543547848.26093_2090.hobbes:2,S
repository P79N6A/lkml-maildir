Greetings...
Of all the bugs i've run into, this is one of the oddest. Hopefully,
i've a) got all the req'd information here and  b)a hope of finding a
solution/workaround/a facsimile thereof to the problem.
System Spec's: K6-2/500
               64 MB RAM
               9.2 Quantum HD
               2.4.0-test7 kernel
               Panasonic 1.44M
FloppyDrive
               Distro: SusE 6.4
Problem: mounting /dev/fd0 or
/floppy gives the following output:
        /dev/fd0 has a wrong major
or minor number!
News to me.../dev/fd0 is still 2,
0, just like it's always been. 8)
The floppy drive was tested with a
boot kernel, and works;  mke2fs -m
0
/dev/fd0 also works well, as does
make bzdisk. 
I checked the /etc/fstab parameters
which are automatically set up upon
installation of SuSE, and these
read as follows:
/dev/fd0        /floppy
auto            auto,user 0     0
All the other devices seem to be
working properly.
Any clues as to what might be a
good workaround to the problem
would be
really appreciated...the -t option
with mount has done nothing, nor
has
rebooting.
Thanks for your time and help.
