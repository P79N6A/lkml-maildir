Having more drivers in the kernel is not bad. However having every
possible driver there is stupid.
A friend of mine created (years ago) an innovative oxygene analyzer for
forest industry. They sold that to all possible factories in Finland and
then got out of business because there were no more customers. What do all
the millions of Linux users benefit if the driver for such device is
included in the kernel? If Linux is really going to be the #1 operating
system in the future then Linux drivers for this kind of devices will be
quite common. In fact a large number of Linux kernel experts will work on
this kind of projects. Isn't there any idea in making their life easier by
dropping the silly idea that everything can be included in the kernel
tree.
Best regards,
Hannu
