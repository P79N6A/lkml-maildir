Hi Greg,
Although I am a bit of a cynic, I really hope that this endeavor works
the way you hope.
I'd also like to offer my services to this quest of yours. If you get
any SD, MMC or SDIO requests, feel free to pass them along to me. I am
not a big fan of debug-by-email though, so I'd prefer vendors who either
can provide samples or where the hardware is cheap and freely available
so I can just go out and by one.
Rgds
