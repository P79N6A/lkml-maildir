I didn't miss it, but it hasn't come up, and I don't think it's actually
all that much an issue of "RTLinux vs RTAI", but simply an issue of "do
you have the same API in user land as in a module"?
Because if you have the same API, you can do non-RT development in user
land, and then just move it over once you know the basic code "works".
Since the API is bound to be fairly limited, that shouldn't be much of a
problem, but I have no idea what the actual development environments
offer, and I have ansolutely zero interest in trying on the RT
"straighjacket" myself ;)
