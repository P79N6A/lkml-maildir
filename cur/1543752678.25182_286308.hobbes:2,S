And I see these errors on i386:
ACPI-1138: *** Error: Method execution failed
[\_SB_.PCI0.LPC0.EC0_.EC8C] (Node c17ee940), AE_AML_BUFFER_LIMIT
ACPI-1138: *** Error: Method execution failed
[\_SB_.PCI0.LPC0.EC0_.EC04] (Node c17eeba0), AE_AML_BUFFER_LIMIT
ACPI-1138: *** Error: Method execution failed [\_SB_.ECPF] (Node
c17ded20), AE_AML_BUFFER_LIMIT
ACPI-1138: *** Error: Method execution failed [\_SB_.BATA._BIF] (Node
c17f3c00), AE_AML_BUFFER_LIMIT
consequently, my /proc/acpi/battery/ is empty. 
Further, when I go to S3 the system does not enter sleep mode (as it did
with 2.6.10).
Otherwise it runs without problems.
cheers,
Hp.
