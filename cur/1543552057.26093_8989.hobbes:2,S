  My suspition is that there is quota enabled on journal and write_dquot()
deadlocks as to write dquot we need to journal and to journal we need
to update quota which is locked for writing :(.
  IMO journal file is one of candidates not to turn quotas on (same as
quota files). Probably some general function which would say on which
files shouldn't be quota enabled will be needed. Quota code will care
about quotafiles and filesystem about the other files if there are any.
Probably best place for this function would be struct dquot_operations but
that would mean to change handling of it. foo_read_super() will have
to fill in the dq_op pointer and quota will never alter it - currently
it's set in quota_on() (and it's also reset in quota_off() and tested
everywhere but I already fixed this in my quota fixes).
  What do you think about it?
