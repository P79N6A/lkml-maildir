 	It seems like this bug is a packed scheduler one and it was 
introduced in 2.6.10-rc2. In the summary of changes from 2.6.10-rc1 to 
2.6.10-rc2 there are a lot of changes announced for the packet 
scheduler.
 	I removed all the changes of the packet scheduler files from the 
incremental patch 2.6.10-rc1 to 2.6.10-rc2, I applied it to 2.6.10-rc1 
and the new 2.6.10-rc2-whithout-sched-changes does not hang.
 	So the problem should be looked in that changes to the pkt sched 
API, the patch containing only those changes is at 
ftp://blackblue.iasi.rdsnet.ro/pub/various/k/patch-2.6.10-sched_changes-from_rc1-to-rc2.gz
