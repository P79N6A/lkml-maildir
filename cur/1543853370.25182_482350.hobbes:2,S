It was introduced for a good reason, and that reason is still relevant
today.  Cdparanoia is not using it gratuitously.  The only problem is
that the implementation had a bug (well, at least two bugs) and only
sg ever implemented it correctly.  Had block and sata implemente dit
correctly, we'd not be having this discussion.
Or you can blame a lower level layer for having no way to inform
mid-level drivers that DMA only completed a partial transfer.
"but anyway"...
This lockup was happening using SATA through the block layer, or does
SATA implement its own version of the ioctl?  Back when I was testing
my probing code, the buggy kernel would reject the request, not lock
up-- did a change make it inot 2.6.18 or later that causes a lockup
instead?
(I never tested with SATA cdroms, as I don't have any.  I tested with
IDE and SCSI and saw correct or detectable behavior)
