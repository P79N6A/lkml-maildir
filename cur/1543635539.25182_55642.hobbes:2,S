Hmm, I wrote an even more cut-down one called hackbench (I really should have
called it schedbench).  Basically, if you can do well on this, you should
do well on Volanomark, since at the core it's the same scheduler-stressing
load.  Look for the linearity of "hackbench 10" to "hackbench 100".
Google is your friend,
Rusty.
