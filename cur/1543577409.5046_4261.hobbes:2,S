Subject: Make errors in 2.4 drivers/acpi, recursive CFLAGS

At least one of the reported make errors on drivers/acpi is caused by a
bug in make 3.78 on alpha.  3.79 works on alpha for that user and 3.77
and 3.79 work on ix86 for me.
Anybody getting recursive CFLAG errors on drivers/acpi with make 3.78
should upgrade to 3.79 or downgrade to 3.77.  The recommended version
is 3.77.  If you still get a problem with 3.77 or 3.79, let me know.
