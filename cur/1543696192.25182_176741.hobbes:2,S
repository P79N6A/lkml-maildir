I reset it to 2:1 while trying to get the PS/2 mouse attached to
my Dell laptop to work "reasonably". I never was fully successful
because I didn't know how the different parameters interacted --
the recent posts to LKML has clarified that.
Currently I only use psmouse_noext, which is absolutely required
to prevent total mayhem. (You wouldn't believe what crap it spews
out otherwise after a resume from suspend.)
