  Have a look at:
http://www.bullopensource.org/posix/Bench/sysbench-oltp/sysbench.html
for benchmarks using Sysbench and MySQL.

  Then you're using glibc AIO implementation based on helper threads
and without taking advantage of kernel support.

  Supported but without notification (SIGEV_NONE only).

  Needs support from the underlying fs.

  Yes, I think so.

  I personally use Sysbench and have compiled 3 MySQL servers,
one with librt AIO, one with libposix-aio and one with MySQL
native simulated AIO.
  You may also try iozone.
