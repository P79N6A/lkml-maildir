(I don't like hardcoding /sbin/depmod; this is just for conversation.)
My problem is that I cross-build my kernels, and 'make rpm' is very
unhappy when it can't use depmod. I know that I can do 'make
DEPMOD=/bin/true rpm', but can't we figure that out automatically?
In general if you're cross-compiling I don't think you can assume
/sbin/depmod is ok. Someone could do 'make DEPMOD=powerpc-linux-depmod'
though (couldn't they? does anybody bother?), so if $(DEPMOD) has been
specified we still want to let that work...
