You *still don't have a clue what config_nonlinear does*.
It doesn't matter if the first 4G of physical memory belongs to node zero.
Config_nonlinear allows you to map only part of that to the kernel virtual
space, and the rest would be mapped to highmem.  The next node will map part
of its local memory (perhaps the next 4 gig of physical memory) to a different
part of the kernel virtual space, and so on, so that in the end, all nodes
have at least *some* zone_normal memory.
Do you now see why config_nonlinear is needed in this case?  Are you
willing to recognize the possibility that you might have missed some other
cases where config_nonlinear is needed, and config_discontigmem won't do
the job?
