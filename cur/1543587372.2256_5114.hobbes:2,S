hi,
the default MAX_ORDER is 10. as i don't know anything about
page usage, i did some tests to see how it affects performance
(with the infamous kernel compile time).
here it is (all +6m):
	1st test	2nd test	mean
2	40.153
3	38.543
4	38.065		38.615		38.350
5	36.778		38.696		37.737
6	37.902		37.800		37.851
7	36.990		36.650		36.820
8	37.157		36.379		36.768
9	37.215
10	37.951
11	36.889
12	36.773
13	36.765
14	36.533
15	37.683
so i conclude that the test is inconclusive. only the first
three (MAX_ORDER == [234]) have noticeable difference, but
those must be affected by the shrinked dentry & page cache
hash table size, right?
the machine has 128mb ram, so the maximum MAX_ORDER that really
works is 14 (largest chunk 32mb).
if i use MAX_ORDER = 6 i save one page. so what should i use?
6, 14, or the default (10)?
would somebody care how the chunks used?
