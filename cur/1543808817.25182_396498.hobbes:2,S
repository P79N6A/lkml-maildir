but there is no 'old behavior' to restore to. The +1 to itimer intervals 
caused artifacts that were hitting users and caused 2.4 -> 2.6 itimer 
regressions, which hrtimers fixed. E.g.:
  
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3289
so i dont think restoring the first timeout of an interval timer to be 
increased by resolution [which your patch does] has any meaning. It 
'restores' to half of what 2.6 did prior hrtimers. Doing that would be 
inconsistent and would push the 'sum-up' errors observed for interval 
timers above to be again observable in user-space (if user-space does a 
series of timeouts). What's the point?
