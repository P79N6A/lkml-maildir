Think about compact flash devices. They also using some kind of flash memory 
and also doing wear leveling. And I think they are not only used with 
FAT16/32! If they run with different filesystems, then your pendrive stick 
will also. Only the interface is different.

I'm not sure if the price was the reason that they failed with different 
filesystems. Some kind of wear leveling tries to guess which blocks of the 
filesystem are in use and which are unused (to avoid wear leveling of unused 
data).
But it only works if you are using a filesystem that is "known" by the wear 
leveling process. If you are using a different one, it fails badly, because 
it tries to interpret a FAT that does not exists, and destroys your 
filesystem while the wear leveling process is running. So this cheap pendrive 
was too intelligent for filesystems other than FAT16....
So if you can use a different filesystem than FAT16/32 on your pendrive, it 
does not matter what kind of filesystem you are using. The wear leveling 
process has no clue about it and always "wear leveling" used *and* unused 
data (means: every block of the whole disk) until it ruins the flash memory.
Hope it helps
