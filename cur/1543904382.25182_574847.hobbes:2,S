    Also, what mmio-ide in the compat properly means in the context of 
ide_platform which is able to handle both port and memory mapped IDE. I think 
we must get rid with this crap, and since this IDE register mapping is pretty 
much board specific, call it something like "mpc8349emitx-ide" instead.
