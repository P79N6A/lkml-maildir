I still don't understand the purpose of SCHED_IDLE. It seems as if the only purpose
is to slow down general execution by a couple of percent in order to make it appear
as if the lowest priority tasks are not using any cpu time -- that is to shift the cost
of lowest priority tasks from running those tasks to general kernel lock management code.
Someone, maybe it was Linus, pointed out that the current range of "nice" levels is totally
arbitrary and simply increasing the range would do good.
