This is a HACK.  This is ONLY a hack.  If this had been a genuine patch, you
would have recieved assurances that it would solve your problems.  But it
might anyway.
The first hunk reports the full 64-bit values, so we can be happy that the
data is reasonable.  The second blocks out all regions which overlap the dos
high memory region (0x0A0000-0x100000), and is not safe for general use.
