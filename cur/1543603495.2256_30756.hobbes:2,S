Hi!
I have some diskless clients whic I want to boot via bootp and nfsroot.
The kernel is loaded fro tftpboot with the option ip=bootp and tries
to find the configuration, the server sends out the informations but
the kernel does not react. I checked the communication with tcpdump
and it looks ok, but 2.4.10 does not get the ip-data.
Is this a known problem?
PS: Please respond by email too, thanks a lot.
Best wishes
Norbert
