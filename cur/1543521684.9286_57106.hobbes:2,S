Now that /is/ a nice idea.  It shouldn't take much memory --
__persistant would probably be a small section that could be kmalloced.
/proc/ksyms would retain the address of the persistant data, just as it
already retains other exported module symbols.  In this case it would
retain that one symbol even when the module is unloaded.  That gives
insmod an address to work with.
