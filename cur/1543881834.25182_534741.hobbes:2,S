Why does everyone think suspend-to-disk was a laptop-only thing?
My personal usage of suspend-to-disk is for turning the computer off in 
the evening and getting the complete FVWM with all programs running, 
open browser tabs,... back the next morning.
All I need for suspending is:
- echo "disk" > /sys/power/state
All I need for getting a running and usable system back is:
- turn on the power at the socket my computer is connected at
- swapoff -a; swapon -a       [1]
- wait a bit until the above commands finished
That's much more convenient than a cold boot.
And it's working with a plain 2.6.16 kernel and zero userspace support.
