Ok, I don't mind the name change from something different than
"private".  I was looking for something to call the interface between
the user and kernel that almost all userspace programs should be using
the library instead of the "raw" kernel interface.  ALSA and netlink are
two examples of this, and I'm sure there's others.
We will probably have more of these in the future, and if they need to
move their "library" into the kernel tree, that's fine too.

Yes, ALSA has gotten a lot better.  But what about the next project that
comes along that has the same kind of binding and it takes a year or so
to figure out the way that the interface should work as no one has ever
done that kind of interface before?  For the majority of things that
people have been complaining about, this has never been done by any
operating system before, the others don't have these problems as they
don't even try :)

So should we just not even document anything we consider "unstable"?
The first trys at things are usually really wrong, and that only can be
detected after we've tried it out for a while and have a few serious
users.  Should we brand anything new as "testing" if the developer feels
it is ready to go?
