It is used in __do_SAK ().

It was not.  The new version will be.

This is used in send_sig_info() and several other functions in
kernel/signal.c.

I don't know what the memory access atomicity assumptions are in the
kernel, so I have used the basic rule that any write<->read conflict on
a variable with type other than atomic_t must be prevented by a lock.
This happens to work for the bit field as well.

The new patch replaces the bit field by a simple "unsigned", a whole
word is allocated for the bit field anyway.

The user-space process must avoid concurrent AUDIT_TTY_SET to get
reasonable results.  There's nothing better the kernel can do.

So I can assume that int-sized reads are always atomic with respect to
concurrent writes?
