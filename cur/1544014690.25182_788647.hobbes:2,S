You are right, I misread the documentation part where it is explained
that already connected sockets are allowed to operate. Btw that code
part breaks codying style with trailing '\' and '&&' on the new line.
There should be something wrong in the patch :)

No you are not, as long as user is allowed to operate with already
connected and/or bound sockets there should be no problems.
