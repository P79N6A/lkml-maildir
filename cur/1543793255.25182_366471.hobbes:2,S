Hello all.
We have even found the hack that fix that problem:

Somehow since 2.6.15-rc1 VM_RESERVED makes get_user_pages return EFAULT. I don't know the exact reason of
that behavior and the correct way to fix that problem. Just kernel interfaces changed once again, the old
point everyone knows. So if someone can explain it, that would be helpful.
