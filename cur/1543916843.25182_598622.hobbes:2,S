Sorry I didn't review the patches earlier when you sent them in private.
The patch looks good to me, especially since you did exactly what I
suggested ;-)
Maybe the description should have another sentence in it about what
the change is good for. You have that in the 0/5 mail, but that does
not go into the changelog, so the information gets lost in the process.
