hai,
    In RH9 the starting function of keyboard.c is handle_scancode, this is 
the function to which the scancode is given by the keyboard interrupt 
handler, its fine, but in FC2 , this handle_scancode is not there, it's 
functionality is spitted and placed in several functions. What is the 
starting function of keyboard.c in FC2?
if anybody knows please suggest on it.
Thanks & Regards,
P.Manohar.
