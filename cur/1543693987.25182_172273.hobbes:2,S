this is not the complete story. Some USB Bluetooth devices are buggy,
that's right, but in some cases the USB host controller is acting very
weird. The ACER BT-500 for example shows the same error on all of my
UHCI based devices (with usb-uhci.o and uhci.o in 2.4), but with a NEC
USB 2.0 card and usb-ohci.o it works fine every time. But if the device
is already plugged in and the UHCI host driver is loaded later, the
device works. Also unloading/reloading of the UHCI host driver helps to
get this device working.
This problem was already mentioned some times in the USB mailing list,
but nobody found the real problem and nobody was able to solve it. From
my experiences this is a problem in combination with some UHCI chips and
the USB part of the Bluetooth devices.
Regards
Marcel
