I was trying 2.4.5-ac14 this morning. I issued some command to test
buffer and page cache behaviour
I run 2 cat /dev/hda > /dev/null and  find / -name \* concurrently
When find finished I ran free and it gave me
fourier:~# free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers	cached

It seems a kernel bug to me, but it didn't hurt, my PC is working
without problems
