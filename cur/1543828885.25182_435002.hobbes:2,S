So you are worried about a priority 1 timer running when the 99 priority
timer expires?  In this case we should up the timer softirq to 99 and make
the currently running timer just like a critical section.  So the latency
would be just the time of the longest running timer callback.

OK, that sounds like a bug.

If the above bug is fixed, that should read "at most" that of the longest
callback.

We really do need the softirq-hrt dynamic. For what I deal with it helps a
lot.  I want the sleeping high priority task wake up when its timer goes
off, and I don't want it preempted when it's not sleeping by timers of
lower priority tasks.

Doesn't work for my situation. Unless I tell the application programers to
up the timer softirq-hrt just before the highest prio thread goes to
sleep. But they are Java programmers and I don't expect them to do this ;)

No, I think fixing the bug you found is better :)
