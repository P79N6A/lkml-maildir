Or we can use a vprintk-like function to parse the format string and
serialize the information into trace buffers. I prefer this latter
option because, overall, it will localize the probes in a few bytes of
functions instead of duplicating the memory and instruction cache
required by multiple serializing functions.
I have the code ready, but I do not want to flood LKML with patches
neither....
