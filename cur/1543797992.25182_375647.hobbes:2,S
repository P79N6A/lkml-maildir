We already take that risk to some degree, since the SMAPI BIOS is also
invoked by the ACPI DSDT and by external events.

It's not implemented yet, but I gather it's necessary for preventing
the disk from spinning back up as the laptop slides off the table.
Maybe I missed some subsequent discussion?

You write "command" values into IO ports 0x1610 and 0x161F and, in
some cases, read some results from ports 0x1610-0x161F. Throughout
that, you inspect various bits (whose meaning we don't understand) in
the status port 0x1604. The details of the commands, scheduling and
status bits differ between the drivers. I don't think a full-blown
ownership and expansion infrastructure is necessary, or even possible
without better understanding.

Thanks for the pointers. I guess the minimal approach is probably
ideal here; are there any such dumb drivers lying around?
