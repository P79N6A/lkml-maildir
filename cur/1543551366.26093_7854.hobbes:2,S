It depends on what you have already. If you're given a (kernel)
virtual address, just dereference it. The unit of currency for
physical pages is the "struct page". If you want to allocate a
physical page for your own use (from anywhere in physical memory)
them you do
    struct page *page = alloc_page(GFP_FOO);
If you want to read/write to that page directly from kernel space
then you need to map it into kernel space:
    char *va = kmap(page);
    /* read/write from the page starting at virtual address va */
    kunmap(va);
The implementations of kmap and kunmap are such that mappings are
cached (within reason) so it's "reasonable" fast doing kmap/kunmap.
If you want to do something else with the page (like get some I/O
done to/from it) then the new (and forthcoming) kiobuf functions
take struct page units and handle all the internal mapping gubbins
without you having to worry about it.
