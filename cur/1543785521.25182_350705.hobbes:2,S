Hi,
I have a number of functions that used to drive a device on an embedded
system. Now that we are moving to Linux, these functions are part of the
kernel space. My question is : what is the best way to access these
from user space ?
With a device driver, is it not a problem to implement about 15 commands through
ioctl in addition to the usual open, close, read write ? It seems a bit
awkward ...
Any advice on this will help a lot. Thanks in advance,
Ivan
