k8topology still needs to work - e.g. for LinuxBios and users which use
acpi=off and as a fallback for broken SRAT tables. You can't break it right now.

Hmm good point. However i would prefer if there was no performance regression
between the two options. However i guess it can be kept like this now.
Just make sure to comment it well.
