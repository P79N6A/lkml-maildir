Mark,
There are several utilities discussed at this url:
http://www.torque.net/sg/u_index.html
including scsidev and sg_map. Devfs shows you this mapping
via its hierarchy:
$ ls -l
total 0
brw-------    1 root     root       8,   0 Dec 31  1969 disc
crw-r-----    1 root     root      21,   0 Dec 31  1969 generic
brw-------    1 root     root       8,   1 Dec 31  1969 part1
$ pwd
/dev/scsi/host1/bus0/target0/lun0/
None of these approaches is completely satisfactory. Kurt Garloff
is working on a patch that seems to address this problem quite
cleanly:
$ cat /proc/scsi/map
