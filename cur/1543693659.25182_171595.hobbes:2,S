Umm...  I don't see anything equivalent to statfs(2) ->f_type in statvfs(2).
->f_frsize makes no sense for practically all filesystems we support.
->f_namemax is not well-defined ("maximum filename length" as in "you won't
see filenames longer than..." or "attempt to create a file with name longer
than... will fail" or "longer than that and I'm truncating";  and that is
aside of lovely questions about the meaning of "length" - strlen()?  number
of multibyte characters accepted by that fs? something else?)
->f_fsid is also practically undefined (and left 0 by practically every fs,
so no userland code can do anything useful with it).
->f_flag might be useful, all right.  However, I'd like to see real-world
examples of code (Solaris, whatever) that would use it in any meaningful
way...
Conclusion: if we care about something like statvfs(), it should *not* have
the statvfs() interface.
