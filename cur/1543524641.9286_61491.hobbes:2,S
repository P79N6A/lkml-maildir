Subject: 2.3.4[1-2] incoming connections -- RPC

Beginning with 2.3.41, incoming ssh connections to my machine take as long
as a minute to start.  Similarly, syslogd takes about a minute to start,
and "netstat -a" takes about a minute to do its thing.  I'm sure there are
other network applications affected.
"strace" shows where things are hanging...  For 2.3.40 and prior, sending
udp packets to port 111 results in "connection refused" (I don't run the
portmapper or any other RPC programs).  Beginning with 2.3.41, the
sending process doesn't get the "connection refused" indication, so it
retries a number of times before giving up.
I guess that could be construed to be a security feature.  However, it
is troubling that there now seems to be a dependency on RPC that didn't
exist prior to 2.3.41.  Would someone "in the know" please explain the
thinking on this to me?  If this matter isn't worth the list's time, a
private reply would be acceptable and very much appreciated.
