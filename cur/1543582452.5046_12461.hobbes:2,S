I must have missed that thread...
Yes, what Al Viro suggests is exactly the same idea as mine, except
that I suggest leaving iget as it is and getting the filesystem to do
a bit of locking.

I think the particular need for a new call is to handle long inode
identifiers better.  The current iget4 is a bit ugly.
If/when a new iget is done to handle long identifiers elegantly, it
would probably be good to include the I_NEW stuff as well, but for now
(2.4) both long identifiers and delayed fill-in can be done without
changing iget.
