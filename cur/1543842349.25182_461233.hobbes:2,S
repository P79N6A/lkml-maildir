That's nothing we can do anything about.  The system cacheline size is
what it is.  If the device doesn't support it, we can't fall back to a
different size, it'll cause data corruption.  So we'll just continue on,
and devices which live up to the spec will act as if we hadn't
programmed a cache size.  For devices that don't, we'll have the quirk.
Arguably devices which don't support the real system cacheline size
would only get data corruption if they used MWI, so we only have to
prevent them from using MWI; they could use a different cacheline size
for MRM and MRL without causing data corruption.  But I don't think we
want to go down that route; do you?
