Have you read my first comment ?
If you said there is nothing in the freebox, how does it boot in order
to recover the firmware ?
They made a no-GPL firmware, that manage the led screen, the adsl chip,
ppp, that can do http request ?
Why does it need to rebbot when a new firmware is available ?
I am bored that people always give the same suspicious arguments...
