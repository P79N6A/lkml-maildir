That's not the whole truth. There are just too many ways to lock up
those 3D chips. For instance I fixed a lockup in the r100 driver where
the order in which state changing commands were sent to the hardware
would cause a lockup. Each individual state changing command is
perfectly valid. Finding all permutations that trigger a lockup would
have been too much of a hassle and may not even have been true for all
supported hardware out there. So we made the user-space driver emit
state changing commands in a fixed order, which seems to work
everywhere.
Regars,
