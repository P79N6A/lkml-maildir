Wonderful news! :)

Wow, building a fan base already.  I'll need all the cheerleaders I can
get! ;)

Absolutely.  I have no intention of removing or modifying those
mechanisms.  My only goal is to see that using them remains the
exceptional case, and not the default behavior of most tasks.

I'm really glad to hear that, Paul.  That unconstrained (ab)use was my
only real concern with the cpusets patches.  I look forward to massaging
our two approaches into something that will satisfy all interested
parties.
