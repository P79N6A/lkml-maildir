Would you agree to a patch to add a kernel boot parameter to skip some
ata ports ?
I found some archives refering to some "ataX=noprobe", but it seems
to have no effect, and I'd like to resurrect it for libata, at least to
help me support my configuration ?
If no, I'll just cook it for me, without posting it...

Paul
