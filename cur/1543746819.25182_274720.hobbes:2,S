Thanks folks. Mathis Ahrens helped me out (and several other nice folks
also offered).
Someone suggested that I should explain why I asked here instead of looking
for an archive I could download from. The reason is that it's a big time-saver
for me. About once a year or so I seem to have some sort of mail accident,
and folks here have been very helpful. I use the mail to produce the Kernel
Traffic newsletter (kerneltraffic.org), a free and hopefully useful weekly
summary about some of the stuff going on here. It's pretty time-consuming
to produce KT, and it saves me a lot of time to be able to ask here for any
missing mail that drops out of my server.
Many thanks again folks, and be well,
Zack
