Can someone enlighten me as to what it really means when  a user land
shmat call, in which the virtual address is provided, fails in the
kernel find_vma_intersection function because
  end_addr(of my SHM) is <= vma->vm_start?
static inline struct vm_area_struct * find_vma_intersection(struct
mm_struct * mm, unsigned long start_addr, unsigned long end_addr)
{
        struct vm_area_struct * vma = find_vma(mm,start_addr);
        if (vma && end_addr <= vma->vm_start)
                vma = NULL;
        return vma;
}
Thanks in advance
Mark
