Thanks!
It works this way without any irq timeout. Unfortunately I can't use it
as a workaround, because CD-R media must be mounted with '-o ro' or I
get 'pktcdvd: Wrong disc profile (9)', so I can't just put it in fstab
and use 'mount /media/cdrom' for both CD-R and RW discs.
This is very new model and I hope they will release new firmware soon.
