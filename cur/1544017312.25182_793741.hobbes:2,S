It was the regular -tip test cycle/iteration: booting the kernel and 
building the next new (random) kernel on that system, then booting that 
(random) kernel ... etc. The warning occured some time after bootup, so it 
probably triggered during the building of the next kernel. (one kernel 
build takes about 1-2 minutes to finish)
The problem was not reproducible - i tried the same config once more and 
it didnt produce the bug. (this system has no known hardware flukes)
