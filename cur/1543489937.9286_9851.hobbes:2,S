hey, i've been working a bit with LLC and NetBeui (aka NetBios frames
protocol) lately. i figure that as long as i'm up to date and intelligable
on the protocols i might as well try to give something back to the
community.. my question is, would there be a general interest in
implementing/supporting NetBeui for linux? (all uglyness/sloth of netbeui
aside, it would make for better compatability in windows environments).
any and all comments appreciated,
-James
