Continuing.
Can't send signals to this remote system.  SIGSEGV not sent.
Noting that 0x0 is correct as the code that triggered this was:
static void (*dummy)(struct pt_regs *regs);
int drop_kgdb(void) {
        struct pt_regs regs;
        memset(&regs, 0, sizeof(regs));
        dummy(&regs);
        return 0;
}
module_init(drop_kgdb);
