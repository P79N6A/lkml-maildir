I concur.  This ailed me since 2.0, on both intel and Alpha.  A buddy of
mine ran into it recently when he started using masq on 2.0 and I told him
to try changing the MTU on his ppp to 1500, which solved the problem (as I
figured it would).
David Miller asked me for some tcpdumps when I first reported it on
linux-kernel over a year ago, which I sent, but he was unable to find the
source of the problem.  Toggling ip_no_pmtu_disc has no effect.  Sort of
embarrassing that Linux networking has held this bug for so long.
cheers,
