When I boot into 2.3.41 on a Sony Viao P300 laptop (128Mb mem)
with 2.3.41 and use fetchmail across a network (not dialing in
with ppp), I get the same failed assertions messages as Phil
Brutsche.
reading message 1269 of 1270 (6079 octets) KERNEL: assertion (tp->copied_seq ==
tp->rcv_nxt) failed at tcp.c(1347):tcp_recvmsg
..... not flushed
reading message 1270 of 1270 (6073 octets) KERNEL: assertion (tp->copied_seq ==
tp->rcv_nxt) failed at tcp.c(1347):tcp_recvmsg
.KERNEL: assertion (tp->copied_seq == tp->rcv_nxt) failed at tcp.c(1347):tcp_recvmsg
.... not flushed
If I boot into 2.3.40 and do the same exact thing, this does not happen.
