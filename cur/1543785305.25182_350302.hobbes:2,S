The parisc tree hasn't been merged with Linus in a long time because I
find git completely impossible to use.  The howtos are all out of date
and contradict each other.  They don't tell me what I need to know.
Everybody who uses them has their own collection of private scripts that
work around the worst misfeatures.  It's a complete fucking disaster.
The Debian cogito package doesn't have half the tools mentioned in the
howtos, as well as being months out of date.  Last time I had the energy
to fight with it, it didn't even support pack files.
I'd love to stop using CVS and just use git.  But it simply doesn't work.
