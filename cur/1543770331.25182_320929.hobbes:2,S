Again, it's about a bottom-up verses top-down approach to maintaining
this logic. To reiterate what both Ingo and Sven previously stated,
it isn't possible to do all of this per path and lock in any sane manner.
This extends to all of the drivers in Linux as well.

The problem with that is that it violates the "sleeping in atomic"
deadlock constraint in that the lock graph enforces a hierarchial
ordering downward, where an atomic lock forces all locks below it to
be also non-preemptible. There are at least 3+ critical sections
that needed to be made preemptible before the rest of the graph can
be correctly preemptible.
I found this out the week before Ingo did his stuff since I was one
of three projects during that time doing this mass retrofit. My project
is seldom mentioned any more since don't post publically very much,
moved to Ingo's tree and have been working on things internally here.
But I had my stuff running in May of last year against 2.6.0, so I was
one of the first folks to see the value of this path and the push into
the problem space. Much of my reasoning is derived from FreeBSD 5.x

Again, (Sven and Ingo) it's impossible to do since the kernel is so
complicate and the interdependencies of locks in the lock graph make
this track effectively impossible when using your manner of attack.

The problem here is not the patch, but instead random hysteria from folks
that don't know the patch and haven't tracked development that are yelping
about fringe problems without an understanding the approach and things
that it address without any completeness
The concepts and suggestion here are not radical. There's plenty of
precedence from traditional RTOSes and other general purpose systems
(FreeBSD 5.x/Solaris/SGI IRIX) that uses these techiques. But the
hysteria around this stuff has really create impressions of what "not to
do in the kernel" without any real or substantial facts otherwise.
The entire debate from both sides is full of misunderstandings and
misconceptions of each approach. Most of it is completely irrational
paranoia from folks that are use to one way of doing things verses
actually looking at the approach from this group's point of view.
Until this is more widely incorporated or used, it's still going to have
what I believe to be a false stigma against it.
