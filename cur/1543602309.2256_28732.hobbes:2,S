I think you're right, it's not a kernel issue.  You should run "tcpdump -qni
ppp0" in a xterm before you start netscape.
You will probably see dns requests going out.  You should check to make sure
that you are not blocking incomming udp ports (1024-5000 for bind, not sure
about resolver...) as that would lengthen the response time considerably if
only a few are open, and completely stop you if all are blocked.
