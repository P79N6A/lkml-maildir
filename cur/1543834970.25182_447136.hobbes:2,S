Ahh, ok, I misunderstood. You want to keep the state changes for clean
page cache pages, I assumed that you only want to make pages volatile
if the get on the inactive_clean list and leave them stable if they
are on one of the other two lists.

Yes, that would help for architectures that cannot implement the
potential-volatile state.

My point was that you really have to distinguish between host memory
pressure and guest memory pressure.
