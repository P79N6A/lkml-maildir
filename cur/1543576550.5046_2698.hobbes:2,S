Try configuring just standard 'VGA text console' and disabling 'Video mode
selection support'. Don't configure any special ATI choices either (or frame
buffering), and see if it boots up then. The Mach64 should have standard VGA
capabilities and should be compatible with every other vga card on bootup.
If it still doesn't work, send me your /usr/src/linux/.config file so I can see
what you have configured.

 Byron
