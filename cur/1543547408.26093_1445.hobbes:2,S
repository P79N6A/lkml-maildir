Hey,
I've been trying to get iptables to compile and run with kernel
2.4.0-test7 with absolutly no luck.  I have tried patching it with both
the patch that comes with the iptables-1.1.1.tar.bz2 and the patches on
CVS.  Could someone tell me which patches need to be applied, in what
order or provide a patch against test7.  Thanks for your help.
