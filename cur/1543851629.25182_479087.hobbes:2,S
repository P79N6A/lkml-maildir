irqpoll has a small impact, how big depends what the box does (on a
gigabit network firewall its bad news, on a typical desktop its not
measurable).
IRQ problems of the form you report can arise from a couple of places -
one is vendors getting IRQ routing tables wrong (suprisingly common),
the other may be a Linux bug.
Checking for a BIOS update may therefore be useful. 
Is this a VIA chipset machine ?
