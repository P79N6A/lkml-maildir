What do you mean?  The usb-storage driver doesn't care at all what the
speed is.  Only the USB core and host controller drivers do.
And if you look at the raw descriptors, which is what is displayed in
/proc/bus/usb/devices in human readable form, the device itself tells
the computer what speed it supports.  The host never tells the device
what speed to run at.
Hope this helps,
