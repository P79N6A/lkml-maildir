It's not an unreasonable expectation (from userspace's point of view)
that the simpler sys_time() system call would run faster than
gettimeofday. I suspect that this may be the case on other platforms.
However, your entire argument seems to be "It helps userspace run
faster? Weird. It shouldn't. They must be doing something wrong,
therefore the patch is stupid."
If that is your argument, then it's bogus. The bottom line is that
code, deployed today, significantly and impressively benefits from the
patch. And it's not a microbenchmark, that ignores the effect on the
rest of the system. Ingo said that both MySQL and X are improved by
this, so between the two of them that covers most every desktop system
and many servers.

You're absolutely correct, gettimeofday *is* called much more
frequently. But not enough to outweigh the gains from sys_time
improvements.

Userspace does, whether you or I think it is legitimate or not, and
that's the reality we need to deal with. Further, I'd argue that it
*does* make sense, as sys_time() should be as cheap or cheaper than
gettimeofday(), and bottom line, userspace code needs to know the time
for lots of reasonable reasons.

Then you'd be penny-wise and pound-foolish, as the saying goes. Said
un-idiomatically, you're optimizing from a microbenchmark point of
view, which is not guaranteed to always be a win.
