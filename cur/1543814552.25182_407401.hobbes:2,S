Subject: [PATCH 000 of 13] md: Introduction
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Following are 13 patches for md in 2.6.last (created against 2.6.16-rc6-mm1).
They are NOT appropriate for 2.6.16 but should be OK for .17.  Please include
them in -mm.
The first three are assorted bug fixes, none really serious
The remainder implement raid5 reshaping.  Currently the only shape change
that is supported is added a device, but it is envisioned that 
changing the chunksize and layout will also be supported, as well
as changing the level (e.g. 1->5, 5->6).
The reshape process naturally has to move all of the data in the
array, and so should be used with caution.  It is believed to work,
and some testing does support this, but wider testing would be great
for increasing my confidence.
You will need a version of mdadm newer than 2.3.1 to make use of raid5
growth.  This is because mdadm need to take a copy of a 'critical
section' at the start of the array incase there is a crash at an
awkward moment.  On restart, mdadm will restore the critical section
and allow reshape to continue.
I hope to release a 2.4-pre by early next week - it still needs a
little more polishing.
