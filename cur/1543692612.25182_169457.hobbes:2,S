Actually the 386 kernel will work just fine on the AMD...  The
workaround is only needed, in the kernel, to protect against the
kernel's own use of non-386 features...
Userspace is a different matter, but userspace has a lot of
model-specific things to worry about beyond this one instruction on
AMD.  In practice: bswap, cmov, cmpxchg, mmx, sse, sse2, so knowing
whether to use prefetch or not is just one more variable for userspace
- and one which any portable app or library will have to know about in
any case.
(Aside: It is quite an anomaly that those cumbersome floating point
instructions are emulated on the older CPUs, yet all the other
instructions aren't emulated.  Emulation is very slow, and forcing
userspace to just use different code instead is good, but that's just
as valid for floating point as it is for MMX, cmpxchg etc.)

To be fair, the kernel really ought to just say that and halt.  That
is a fine compromise.  It won't make embedded systems folks completely
happy, because if you've only got 2MB of NVRAM for your whole kernel
_and_ filesystem including user data (think PDA or cellphone), then a
hundred bytes here or there is actually worth trimming.
But then, those sort of embedded folks should just figure out
compressed software-suspend, and then they can ditch __init data from
the NVRAM image completely.  It's much better to lose all of __init
than just a few bytes here or there, isn't it?
