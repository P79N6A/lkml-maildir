Hrm... I'm not sure how all of this works. Somebody suggested just
picking the VGA card that has IO enabled at boot (so basically
adding a quirk to x86 that "remembers" the pci_dev of whatever
VGA card had IO enabled during first PCI probe).

Ok.

I think I'll keep my current loop... so far it worked fine... (just
check for the signature). I may be able to check ATI specific signatures
in there, I don't know if it's worth the pain...

Maybe I should actually do more sanity checking on the values I read
from the BIOS, and based on that, try everything again the "other"
way... Hrm... it's all pretty nasty, I don't even have an x86 box
with a radeon to play with yet ;)

It just does a loop looking for the aa55 signature.
