Indeed; prelinked stuff is not randomized. If you want both, prelink
with -R gives the same benefits as ASLR of the shared library location,
pretty much (obviously the libraries have the same address in every
process --- that's kind of the point --- but what that address is is
randomly selected at prelink time).
Prelinking should not affect stack layout randomization.
