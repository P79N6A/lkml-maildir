Just a small suggestion: Why not ALSA?
I mean, 2.5 is there for new things, indeed. But alsa are drivers (ie: it
shouldnt affect core code and you haven't to use them if you don't want) ,
and after all it's one of those things that lots of people have to add (a
lot of times manually and lots of people doesn't want to know how to patch
a kernel; although all distros ship it).
In some cases, alsa gives you decent sound (in the case of my sound card,
which is both supported by oss and alsa). Other times, you've not a choice.
And although it's not perfect code, and it has bugs, i bet the alsa people
wouldn't mind to help to solve them.
I'm not saying we should merge 2.5 changes in 2.4 but...
Just a very hume and small suggestion :)
