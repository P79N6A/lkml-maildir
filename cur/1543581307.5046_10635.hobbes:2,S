	It generally forces another DNS lookup.  If you do a resolve on
a name of type=ANY it returns any MX records and A records.  If you then
do a resolve on the MX records, you then get a CNAME and then have to
add an additional lookup for the CNAME.  If you have a lot of MX records
and not all the servers are "up" that can add up to a significant
increase in DNS traffic.
