Hello,
Still using Linux V2.2.6 on all machines in this configuration:
ftp server -> router LAN to PPP -> router PPP -> home LAN -> ftp client.
I see ACKS being sent for packets that are way too old to be correct.
For instance, current ftp-data will have an ID of 6128 with subsequent
ACKs having an ID of 1 or two behind (correct), then all of the sudden,
there will be ACKS in the range of 1500 or so. This will continue until
the ACKS jump back within range.
Zipped dump is included.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
