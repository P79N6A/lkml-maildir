untar runs about 5K...same as 'un-cpio'. No differece there.
But not from userland. Tar is used en masse, cpio isn't.
It's the only reason to use tar over cpio...I feel it's a
good one.

#1 I'll be reviewing initramfs and adding loading images from
the kernel support. I don't deny it's a good thing to have.
#2 My main complaint is Jeff said if initramfs goes in
initrd comes out. initrd should not come out. Let me clarify: the
abilty of the bootloader to load images/archives for the kernel
to extract should not come out.
My patch is the best of both because, it re-writes initrd
properly within a sane framework. (Not to mention I scrubed the hell
out of do_mounts.)
If you want to get rid of all the backwards compatible stuff
(IE identifing and loading raw images to /dev/ram0,
pivoting to /initrd) that's fine with me. The code is layed out now
so I can litterally cut it out 10K of that junk in 30 seconds.
Better yet I can ifdef it for the poor souls that still need it.
