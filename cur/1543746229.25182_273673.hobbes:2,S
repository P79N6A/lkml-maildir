(The fewer the better.)
That's good news, and frankly, I did not expect anything else. That's because
either programs definitely know that "it" is a file/directory because they just
mkdir'ed or so, or they implement correct error checks, e.g. the user just
created a directory and we check back (i.e. race protection).
What I am worried about is the opendir() libc call, which AFAIK does this:
  fd = open("directory", myflags | O_DIRECTORY)
OTOH, I'm not worried, because it should be the user's duty to check whether
directory really is one or not. Anything else is sloppy programming.
(Exception: taking argv[xx] from the user)
Cheers,
