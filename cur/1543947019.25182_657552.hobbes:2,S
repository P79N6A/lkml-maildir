Sorry, I don't understand.  Are you worried that process A might set
suspending_task = A but then process B might still see suspending_task
== NULL?  Or that A might set suspend_task = NULL but then B might
still see suspending_task == A?
Neither one will cause any problem, since the only case that matters is
when B sees suspending_task == B -- and that can happen if and only if
B was the last process to set suspending_task.
In fact, you might as well get rid of the set_suspending_task() routine 
entirely and just put the assignments inline.

Where is this get_device() undone?  Shouldn't there be an extra 
put_device() added to unregister_dropped_devices()?

And now the change to device_destroy() isn't needed at all.
