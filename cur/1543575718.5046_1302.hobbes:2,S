Subject: IDE hang when using v4l (bttv) on all kernels.

I've had this problem for a while now, reported it back in 2.3.x somewhere.
I havn't needed v4l so I ignored it.  Playing with my bttv again and having
a lot of trouble
After some (random) amount of frame grabs, my system loses.  Badly.
ethernet quits forwarding, IDE refuses to respond... All I can do is
switch VCs and watch errors scroll by.
This may be a chipset problem, although I've seen reference to others
having problems with this driver and IDE in the past.
Tested with v4l1/2 for all kernels up to 2.4.0-test12
Lockup still happens if IDE DMA is disabled.
Please Cc: me if you want any additional information, I read L-K via
the web archives.
spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7.
Failed to read 258048 bytes, got 0: Success
 ^^^^^ my v4l program.
