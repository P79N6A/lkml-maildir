Small question - is it OK that 'faster_copy' is faster than
'even_faster'? By only few percents, but... It is dual cpu Tyan,
with two AMD MP 1.2MHz, with 1022:700C AMD hostbridge. I'll
check KT133 at home if I'll remember...
                                        Thanks,
                                                Petr Vandrovec
