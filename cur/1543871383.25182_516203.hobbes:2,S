Chapter 5.31 (
http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Alignment.html
) states
that "it is an error to ask for the alignment of an incomplete type"
and flexible array members have incomplete type (according to ISO C99
as described in 
http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Zero-Length.html
).
It sounds to me like the alignment of an incomplete type is not
guaranteed (as you can't even enquire about it, though I might be
wrong). This is probably dependent on the compiler as well - with
gcc-3.3 on x86, __alignof__(unsigned long long) is 8 but the
"offsetof(struct test, data)" below is 12 (and it doesn't make any
difference whether it is a 0-size array or not):
struct test {
    unsigned long a;
    unsigned long b;
    unsigned long c;
    unsigned long long data[];
};

I'm OK with flexible arrays (kmemleak uses them as well) but not as a
member of structure getting passed to the container_of macro.
I did a quick grep through the kernel and it looks like Linux mainly
uses 0-size rather than flexible arrays at the end of a structure
(>500 vs ~14). This might be for historical reasons but it's not a big
issue in modifying them.

Kmemleak needs the sizeof the member passed to container_of and I'm
not aware of any __builtin_* predicate that would detect incomplete
types.
