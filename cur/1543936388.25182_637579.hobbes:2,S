A quick response on this change, without having checked the rest yet:
This doesn't work.  Each "ne" may have zero or more "ud".  The purpose
of nodemgr_remove_uds is to kill all of the uds of one ne.  After your
change, only the first ud of a ne would be gone.
You need to keep the loop which takes care that all of the uds of the ne
are removed.
Furthermore, I usually try to use "goto" or "break" constructs with
single unlock + return path instead of multiple unlock + return paths.
However, if these unlock + return paths are as visually close together
as they are here, it doesn't really matter (to me) which of the styles
is used.
BTW, you don't need to CC <krh@redhat.com> on drivers/ieee1394/ patches
(CONFIG_IEEE1394).  He only looks after drivers/firewire/
(CONFIG_FIREWIRE).  I know, these are details, and everybody confuses
them.  :-)  I should try to clarify this in MAINTAINERS.
