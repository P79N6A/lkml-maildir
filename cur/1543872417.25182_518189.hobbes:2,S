It's sad that sched_yield is still in our graphics card drivers ...

Ah that's some nice detective work there. Mainline does some rather complex 
accounting on sched_fork including (possibly) a whole timer tick which rsdl 
does not do. make forks off continuously so what you say may well be correct. 
I'll see if I can try to revert to the mainline behaviour in sched_fork 
(which was obviously there for a reason).
