Jeremy Alison used to be the one who was always pestering me to add
Streams support into ext4, but recently he's admitted that I was right
that it was a Very Bad Idea.
As I mentioned in my Linux.conf.au presentation a year and a half ago,
the main use of Streams in Windows to date has been for system
crackers to hide trojan horse code and rootkits so that system
administrators couldn't find them.  :-)
