I think you have it backwards here, given that Linux works one way and you
want it to work another. Basically, I would suggest that it is up to you
to prove that multi-user is NOT a solution for "clueless" user, especially
given that there have been a number of suggestions on how to do it without
changing the kernel or even changing software.
If you can't prove the case, I rather suspect that your patch won't make
it. Don't feel bad though, I've yet to get one through either. :o)
