Well, actually, OF works great.  I've managed to use BootX a grand total
of maybe 6 times on my 7500, 4 installers, one to check a booting bug, and
one because it came that way.  Recent kernels boot fine under OF.  Hell,
the vmlinux-2.2.0-pre1 that's put up boot'ed some linuxppc.org box from OF
1st.

They boot fine.  Tried re-running quik?

I'm thinking you've broken something locally.  2.1.12x, 2.1.13x and
2.2.0-preX have all OF booted here.

He also happens to be hacking away at ADB, and done a good deal of work
inside drivers/macintosh, and on the pbg3 bays in linuxppc and helped out
on the Mk side.
