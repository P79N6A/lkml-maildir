	[Venkat] It would be a very bad idea for the linux kernel to look
into the card to see whether the BIOS for that card has been enabled to make
it determine the scsi drive order. If you had followed the earlier threads,
the correct way to proceed would be to use labels to make things node
independent. I think Andreas is working on patch for 2.2.18 and 2.4.0
kernel.
