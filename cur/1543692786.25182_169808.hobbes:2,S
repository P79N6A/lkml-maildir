Subject: [PATCH] [TRIVIAL 12/12] 2.6.0-test6-bk remove reference to modules.txt in sound/Kconfig

This patch removes the reference to Documentation/modules.txt,
which has been removed.  The patch was made against the current
2.6-bk tree.
This patch was also done slightly differently than the rest, removing
only the reference to Documentation/modules.txt, and maintaining the
reference to the other document.
