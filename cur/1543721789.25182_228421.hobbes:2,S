Subject: [PATCH] Stop printk printing non-printable chars
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
I have had problems recently with the output from dmesg. Somewhere in
the depths of ACPI (drivers/acpi/tables.c:104) the
header->asl_compiler_id contained non-printable characters, and it made
xterm stop displaying any more output. dmesg|less had to be used as less
filters out the duff chars.
The main problem seems to be in ACPI, but I don't see any reason for
printk to even consider printing _any_ non-printable characters at all.
It makes all characters out of the range 32..126 (except for newline)
print as a '?'.
Patch is for 2.6.7.
Matthew
