Yes, but any driver assuming that the pci_module_init() functionality
has not changed from 2.4 to 2.6 will be broken.  I've fixed up all of
the drivers that did this in the 2.6 tree.

Due to the change in the way the function works, I'm slowly changing
drivers over to the new function.  It's just too dangerous over time to
leave it alone.
Chris, I agree with Christoph, convert more drivers over before marking
this function "obsolete".  In fact, just convert everyone and then
delete the #define all together, that's what I have been working toward.
