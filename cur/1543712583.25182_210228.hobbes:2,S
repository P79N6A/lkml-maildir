then to answer your question; at compile time you tell glibc what
minimum kernel version it can assume, and based on that glibc will
enable/disable certain features. So it depends on what your distro
supplied there if it'll work or not. if you tell glibc that at minimum
you do 2.4.1 for example, then no a 2.2 kernel won't work. I think most
distros do this (or an even later version) since a few years now.
