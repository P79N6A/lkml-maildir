I disagree. In the 1970's, the excess LOD was as much as 3 msec.
After going down some, the mid 1990's it rose to around 2 msec.
Now, it is around 1 msec.
Here is a plot
http://www.iers.org/MainDisp.csl?pid=95-100
Only the long period variations count for leap seconds - the seasonal  
and other high frequency
oscillations tend to average out.
In the early part of the last century (~1905), it decreased by ~ 5  
msec in a year or so.
If that happened right now, it would go to ~ -4 msec negative, and we  
would be seeing
2 negative leap seconds or more per year. Even if the decrease from  
1975 to 1985 happened again, it
would be at -1 msec, and we would have a negative leap second every  
two years or so.
What is a reasonable assumption is that we would likely have a year or  
more warning of the
likelihood of a negative leap second.
