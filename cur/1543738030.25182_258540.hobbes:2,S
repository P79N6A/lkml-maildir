That makes no sense to me whatsoever, I'm afraid. Why if they were allowed
"to steal a few cycles" are they so fervently banned from being in there?
You can keep them out of your userspace management part if you want.
So we have the purely exclusive stuff, which needs kernel support in the form
of sched_domains alterations. The rest of cpusets is just poking and prodding
at cpus_allowed, the membind API, and the irq binding stuff. All of which
you could do from userspace, without any further kernel support, right?
Or am I missing something?
