What type of NUMA system is this? How many nodes? Is memory exhausted on 
some so that allocations are redirected? Are cpusets or memory policies
used to redirect allocations?
Maybe we get confused about local and remote objects due to fallback and 
contamination of the per node lists with foreign node objects. I have a 
patch here that make the slab allocations not fall back and insures that 
cpuset do not interfere but it involves patching the page 
allocator to not do fallback for slab allocations.
Lets see if we can figure this one out first.
