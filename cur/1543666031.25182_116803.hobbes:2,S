Well, if it happens only to 10 people per
year, it is a non-problem.

If it only happens so rarely, people
are unlikely to complain too loudly.
Take a look at e2fsck. That's similar to
bk -- awfull lot of corner cases. And
guess what, if you mess up your disk
badly enough, it will just tell you to
fix it by hand (deallocate block free bitmap
in full group). And its okay.
(Plus I believe chkdsk has *way* bigger
problems than that.)
I'm sure you are not going to throw away
ext2 just because it has 1-person-per-3-years
problem. 99% solution is going to be
good enough for me, Andrea and
Martin. Linus can keep using bk.
