That did not help. The distortion is no stuttering, but noise in the music. 
It's not specific to xmms, freeamp and xine also have the noise. The noise 
reminds me of years ago when my father used a electric shaver witch gave 
noise in the sound of my radio. Maybe that can give you an idea about the 
sort of noise.
The changelog of 2.4.3 said that there were via-chipset-fixes undone, could 
this be a problem of my chipset?
