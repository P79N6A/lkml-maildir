For my master laurea thesis I developed PackageFS that aims to 
transparently manage packages in several distros.
There are also many other facilities:
- View a directory-based tree of packages (with the files that each package owns)
which can be nested by category, or by priority
In the future
- you will be able to add users to "packages" group to make them able 
to manage packages
- you can mount the file system on a cluster to transparently manage
several hosts
You can find my thesis at 
http://packagefs.sourceforge.net
I think FUSE is a very good idea (as good as the actual implementation is),
IMHO it should be inserted in the mainline kernel.
Thanks to Miklos and other developers. 
Luca
