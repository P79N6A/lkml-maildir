More careless --- UTP is more forgiving than 10Base2; if you leave a cable 
dangling unconnected (or accidentally snap the cable) a UTP LAN will still 
work aside from the machine(s) disconnected by the cable break, whereas 
10Base2 will probably give you many errors and kill throughput on the entire 
LAN.
It's considered bad form for a cable break on one side of the building to 
screw up a file transfer between two machines next to each other on the 
other side of the building... bot with 10Base2 this can happen.
And Cat.5 is more flexible; I can run a cable under the floor a lot more 
easily and with less risk of damaging the cable (see previous paragraph).  
Putting a kink in coax can put a pretty serious kink in your network even if 
the cable isn't broken!

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
