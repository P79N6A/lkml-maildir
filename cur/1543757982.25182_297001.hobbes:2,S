Done. Following is my new loaded module list:

Looks better now?
I guess I can no longer monitor the processor temperature and
such after preventing i2c from loading, but what what's the
penalty of preventing microcode from loading? a performance
hit?
I will be testing memory as suggested by Hugh Dickins as well.
Hopefully, your trick or Hugh's suggestion will help revealing
the source of the problem, if not the kernel itself.
