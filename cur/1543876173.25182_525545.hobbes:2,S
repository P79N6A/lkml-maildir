Subject: [PATCH 2/4] [SCSI]stex: extend hard reset wait time
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/30/297

During hard bus reset of st_shasta controllers, 1 ms is not enough for
16-port controllers, although it's good for 8-port controllers.  Extend the
wait time to 100  ms to allow bus resets finish successfully.
