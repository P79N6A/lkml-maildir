I was afraid somebody would say that.
I need look no further than the shelf at my right hand for a full set of 
Pentium documentation.  I do not consider that an adequate substitute for a 
document expressing the syntax of all machine instructions of a particular 
architecture in the GNU syntax.
The only excuse I can think of for not having such a document is "we're all 
so busy we couldn't write it, please use the Intel documentation".  Please 
don't suggest that we have no need for our own documentmentation, written in 
a form familiar to us.

Err, now I feel I wrote the above a little too strongly, but I'm not going to 
change it, because it was my initial reaction.  Yes, that's *exactly* what I 
want.
