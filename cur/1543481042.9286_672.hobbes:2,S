Ext2fs stores directories as a singly linked list with elements something
like this:
[inode][reclen][namelen][name...         padding]
Reclen is the length of the entire record including the whole name and
some alignment padding. Inode is the file in question.
To figure out what's corrupted, you might do something like the following:
find / -exec ls -id '{}' ';' | grep 284673
which will find the directory with the corrupted entry. Then you can pull
out debugfs and poke around at the inodes to figure out more. If you need
to get at the file or directory data, it's a fairly simple matter to write
a C or Perl program to grab blocks from a device using llseek and read.
Lots of things could cause something like this to happen, BTW. In order of
likelihood, I'd investigate:
 drives
 cables
 controller/chipset/DMA
 memory (Try "gzip -9 < huge1 | gunzip > huge2; md5sum huge1 huge2"
         repeatedly)
Figuring out which file is corrupted might be quite revealing though.
