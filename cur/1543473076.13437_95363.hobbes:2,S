Hi,
This may sound as completley stupid question but since I want to avoid
kernel with loadable modul support and I also need to make some
SCO binaries executable is there any way to make iBCS modul part of
kernel? I have managed to link it with kernel but it doesn't work :((
Thanx for help in advanced.
Best regards,
Goran Gajic 
p.s. I've tried this with 2.0.36 kernel
