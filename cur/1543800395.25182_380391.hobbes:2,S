I've tried different values and sometimes I've got a good feeling BUT
the behaviour is too strange to say something.
Sometimes I get what I want (dd priority ~17 and CPU eaters prio
25), sometimes I get a total disaster (dd priority 17 and CPU eaters
prio 15/16) and sometimes I get something like DD prio 22 and CPU
eaters 23/24.
All this is not well related to "unacceptable_ia_latency" values.
What I think is that the priority calculation in ingosched and other
schedulers is in general too weak, while in other schedulers is rock
solid (read: nicksched).
Maybe is just that the smarter a scheduler want to be, the more fragile
it will be.
