Hi,
        using the tools (tcpdump/etheareal) can watch the packet
information. If the destination address is not matching with the router
specified, can say its not meant for router, host only...and also checking
the IP options, whether IP_DONTROUTE is set for the host...
I think this is one way...
regards,
srinivas.
