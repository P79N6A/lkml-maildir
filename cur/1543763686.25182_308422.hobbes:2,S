I can't see how you expect to save 128-36=92 bytes here. You replace
sizeof(struct kstatfs)=64 with sizeof(struct kstatfs*)=4, which would
be a saving of 60 bytes. But the call to kmalloc()/kfree() reduces
your stack saving further, not to mention the runtime penalty,
introduced by allocating dynamic memory.
Regards, Olaf.
