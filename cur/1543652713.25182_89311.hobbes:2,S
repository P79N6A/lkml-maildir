I installed 2.4.19 and I got 
kernel: eth0: Transmit error, Tx status register 90
I red some e-mail about this problem and I realize that it was a issue
in the old version of the 3c59x driver (1999).
I think it was fix in 2.4.14 and it is back in 2.4.19.
I saw a revert patch in che changelog of 2.4.19 ....................
Has anybody notice this problem ?
( I am not in the mailing list please reply to my e-mail )
Thanks
Alfredo
