I only looked at your version and it looked general thats why I brought
up the code sharing idea - which I agree is not possible.

Alpha uses the imlementation in lib/*print.c somehow.
And I think the right choice would be to implement
a private version of early_printk for alpha like the
other architectures do.
Thanks for the split-up. I could follow the changes now.
