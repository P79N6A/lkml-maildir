Download the Drive Fitness Test "Linux disk creator" (which isn't
actually a "disk creator" like the Windows version, but simply a file
you dd onto a 1.44MB floppy), then boot off that and try the Quick test.
If that doesn't show anything wrong, try the Advanced test or whatever
the longer one is called.
If DFT doesn't fail outright and instead offers to erase part of the
drive for you to "repair" it, that means there are bad sectors.
Conversely, if the Advanced test shows Disposition Code 00, that means
the drive is probably OK. (I think another way of interpreting the
results is that OK results are text on a green background, and failures
are text on red.) Anyway, this stuff will seem more obvious once you try
it.
