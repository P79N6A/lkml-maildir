No. Still the same: gpm starts, X starts... no kbd/mouse.
Remove Pc-Card: queued events are processed  (doesn't that hint at an IRQ
not delivered?). Reinserting of the PC-Card no longer affects kbd/mouse
BTW. This is a PS/2 touchpad, so the trouble appears to be confined to 
interrupt delivery within the PS2/kbd driver with possible sideeffects
from the PC-Card subsystem. At least that's my read of the situation.
