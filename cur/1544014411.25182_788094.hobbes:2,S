Tony, Pierre,
Here is a patch that fixes a MMC host controller deadlock. The problem happens 
when removing the MMC/SD device when a transfer is on-going.
It has been tested on OMAP3430 but this fix should apply to OMAP2 chips as 
well, as seen from the TRMs.
What do you think?
Regards,
Jean.
    OMAP: MMC: recover from transfer failures
    Timeouts during a command that has a data phase can result in the
    next command issued after the command that failed not being processed,
    i.e. no interrupt ever occurs to indicate the command has completed.
    This failure can result in a deadlock.
    The indication that the mmc host controller is in this error state is
    that the DATI bit is set in the PSTATE register.  This patch checks
    to see if the DATI bit is set before starting a new command, and if it
    is set it resets the data state machine to clear the error.
    Tested on OMAP3430 chip and intensive MMC/SD device removal while
    transferring data.
Regards,
Jean

Timeouts during a command that has a data phase can result in the
next command issued after the command that failed not being processed,
i.e. no interrupt ever occurs to indicate the command has completed.
This failure can result in a deadlock.
The indication that the mmc host controller is in this error state is
that the DATI bit is set in the PSTATE register.  This patch checks
to see if the DATI bit is set before starting a new command, and if it
is set it resets the data state machine to clear the error.
