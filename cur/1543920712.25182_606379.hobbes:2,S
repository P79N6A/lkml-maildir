On reset(1), cursor size, palette, and bell parameters _do_ get reset
to the defaults. Some defaults may already be changed by the user,
like palette or default_utf8.
Bell configuration is currently not one of them so, should a program
decide to reset the tty, or should it happen that your output is
garbled (forcing you to do reset), some settings change back to
"unwanted defaults".
