Just found another issue. Sometimes (say 1 of 10 tries), I get freeze
(nothing is logged at all), when I press ctrl-c just after starting
tse3play. I cannot freeze it with pmidi-1.6, so I'm not sure it is rtc
related at all. My tse3play is from tse3-0.3.1
http://tse3.sourceforge.net/
I'm playing midi file to qsynth.
