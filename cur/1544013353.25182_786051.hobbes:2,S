One possibility would be to mimic ext4 and register the fs as "btrfsdev"
until it's considered stable enough for production.  I agree with the
consensus that we want to use the upstream kernel as a nexus for
coordinating btrfs development, so I don't think it's worth waiting a
release or two to merge something.
