I understsand the explanation but I don't think my patch is wrong, I
think it's simpler and faster instead.
My argument is very simple, if send_head points to skb and skb->len is
zero and we are running in such slow path, it is obvious the send_head
_was_ NULL when we entered the critical section, so it's perfectly fine
to set send_head back to null and to unlink the skb as the only actions
to undo the skb_entail. That's all. I don't see how my patch can fail.
If I'm missing something I'd love a further explanation indeed. Thanks!
