Actually, this is cmnd->done, not req->done we're removing.
cmnd->done() isn't seen by the block layer; all its uses are in the SCSI
mid-layer.

It's a good thought.  You're right, the old code calls done for every
iteration.  However, it calls it in scsi_finish_completion.  The new
code will actually call drv->done() in that same spot for every
iteration as well.
The requeue is done via scsi_requeue_request which calls
blk_requeue_request, which resets the START flag and sends the command
right back through the system (including the prep function because
scsi_requeue_request unpreps the command), so even with the new code
we'll go back through all the same done paths.
