The problem is nested deeper, I suspect.
When accessing the detected sensor on my toshiba 8100,
the automatic temperature control isn't working any longer...
Normally you can hear it starting every time, the cpu is under

Better you reboot quickly after that, with lm-sensors (2.62) disabled
then...
Details on request.
