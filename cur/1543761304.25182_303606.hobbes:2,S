CON_BOOT is like early printk in that it allows for output really early on.
 It's better than early printk because it unregisters automatically when a
real console is initialised.  So if you don't get consoles registering in
console_init, there isn't a huge delay between the boot console
unregistering and the real console starting.  This is the case on PA-RISC
where we have serial ports that aren't discovered until the PCI bus has
been walked.
I think all the current early printk users could be converted to this
scheme with a minimal amount of effort.
