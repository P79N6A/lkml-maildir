Does anyone know the actual details of the LILO breakage?  If the 
problem is that LILO doesn't null-terminate the string when it's too 
long, then we can deal with this automatically, without introducing 
compile-time options (which were already once rejected.)
If the problem is with LILO booting *old* kernels, then that's going to 
have to require some LILO changes, and probably a boot revision bump.
