These are the exception not the rule, though, so I don't think we should
design primarily for them.  On most decent cards, we can not only ask
for link status from a register, but also get interrupts when link
change occurs [though we may still need a timer for certain link
states].

we want netif_carrier_{on,off} to emit netlink messages.  I don't know
how DaveM would feel about such getting implemented in 2.4.x though,
even if well tested.
Note we went over netif_carrier_xxx and related issues not a week ago,
IIRC
