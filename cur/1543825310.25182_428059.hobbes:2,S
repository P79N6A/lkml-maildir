You've just described the embodiment of the two order's of magnitude
issue I mentioned. That's not a wrong assumption - think of the
above case with global_unused count now being 1.28*10^7 instead of
1.28x10^4. How many dentries do you have to free before freeing any
on the small superblock if we don't free one per call? (quick
answer: 99.9%).
If we shrink one per call, we've freed all 128 dentries while there
is still 1*10^5 dentries on the large list. That seems like a much
better balance to make within the constraints of the shrinker
resolution we have to work with.
FWIW, if we don't free a dentry per sb per prune_dcache call, any
prooblems caused by slab page pinning and fragmetnation get worse
than they are now as some dentries will take far, far longer
to be freed than others regardless of their age.

Hmm - need to do something with that age_limit field, right? That
would imply we need a timestamp in the dentry as well, and we don't
shrink any sb that doesn't have dentries older than the age limit.
If we scan all the sb's and still have more to free, then we halve
the age limit and scan again....

Why? Forward or reverse it's only one traversal to free all dentries
- you go till the list is empty. Either way, with the prefetch of
the next entry in the list there's little perfomrance difference
once you've got outside some tiny subset of the list that might be
hot in cache....

Dave.
