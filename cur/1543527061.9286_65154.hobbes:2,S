Hi all,
        Well, here i am again...
        OK.. i was able to read the article from zdnet.com web site about
"Compiling Linux 2.2 Kernel"
http://www.zdnet.com/zdhelp/stories/main/0,5594,2213046,00.html
        I would like second opinion on the steps given there.
        1. Download the kernel ( As pointed out before, insteat of 2.3.xx I
have got 2.2.14. Is that the latest stable kernel ??)
        2. Uncompress & untar the sources at /usr/src/linux
        3. make config ( or make menuconfig, or make xconfig ) . how do i
know if Tcl/Tk is installed??? They suggest that the Documentation directory
in the 2.2 sources helps regarding each section of config questions.
        4. make dep
        5. make zImage ( Compiling the source )
        6. make modules
        7. make modules_install
        8. Copy the new kernel to the place where the old kernel was.
        9. Add the new kernel image section in lilo.conf
        10. Run lilo.
    And reboot.
        I have one LAST question ( Please be patient .. please) do i need
anything else, updated gcc?? updated libs??? what libs??
Thanks for all your time.
Regards
Pavan
        One
