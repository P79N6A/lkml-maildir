I have a question about chipset compatibility for
video.
I have an Asus motherboard with integrated graphics
using the nVidia chipset and a large monitor
(1680x1050) and eventually got it to work. 
I have a new Asus motherboard that I'm thinking about
using as a replacement that uses the new AMD 690G
chipset. I'm thinking of using it in the workstation
and using the nVidia board on a colo machine.
My question - how friendly is the video drivers in
Linux with the AMD690G chipset? Is it going to work in
1680x1050 mode easily or should I stick with nVidia?
