Lets look at a typical example of how IO actually gets done today,
starting with sys_write():
sys_write(file, buffer, 1MB)
for each page:
    prepare_write()
	allocate contiguous chunks of disk
        attach buffers
    copy_from_user()
    commit_write()
        dirty buffers
pdflush:
    writepages()
        find pages with contiguous chunks of disk
	build and submit large bios
So, we replace prepare_write and commit_write with an extent based api,
but we keep the dirty each buffer part.  writepages has to turn that
back into extents (bio sized), and the result is completely full of dark
dark corner cases.
I do think fsblocks is a nice cleanup on its own, but Dave has a good
point that it makes sense to look for ways generalize things even more.
