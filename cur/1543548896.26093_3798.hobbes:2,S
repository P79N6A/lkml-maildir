[ Sorry if this is already known, I have been too busy to read all lkml
mail, ignore if so ]
When ide-scsi is inserted it detects the drive(s) all over again in the
following manner
Detected scsi CD-ROM sr?????? at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0 
where ?????? is a looping number, my guess is from 0 to infinity (well
whatever the size is). This renders the system unusable.
Other glitches I have noticed but haven't yet had time to work on, while
booting:
request_module[scsi_hostadapter]: Root fs not mounted
request_module[scsi_hostadapter]: Root fs not mounted
However I have only the SCSI options necessary for ide-scsi, this is a
IDE-only system.
Another thing is that either the kernel or the new modutils break
RedHat's mixer-setting/sound detection scripts. (I have a es1371 based
soundcard) However once the sound modules are manually inserted & mixer
settings loaded, sound works just fine. I'm not sure but I think I saw
this already with -test7.
The kernel also breaks lmsensors but that's probably yet another
story...
