I think that is very much the case. As I was setting up patches for the
Kernel-Janitors to clean up the wait-queue usage in the kernel, I found
I was unable to use wait_event*(), as locks needed to be
released/grabbed around the sleep. wait_event_*_lock() fixes this
problem, clearly :)

I will submit a new patch which documents the general structure of the
wait_event_*() class of functions, including what you have written.
