Yep, we could do that. But it is not 100% solution (you could have
some non-root filesystem mounted, and corrupt that one), anyway, and
I'd rather keep people from using it than complicating swsusp even
more. u-swsusp is going to make this obsolete, anyway, and can do any
sanity checks it wants to.
