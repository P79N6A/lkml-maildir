This is to be expected -- I use a "sledgehammer fix" for the Maxtor and
Seagate errata -- each transfer is limited to 15 sectors.
When I get a chance to clean up the SiI driver, the performance will
indeed increase by a large amount.
For now, for Silicon Image, I recommend using the
drivers/ide/pci/siimage.c -- assuming it works for you, of course.
The libata Silicon Image driver is marked with CONFIG_BROKEN because it
is fairly easy to lock it up (I need ack some more interrupts).
