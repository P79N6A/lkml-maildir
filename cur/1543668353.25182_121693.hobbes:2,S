This is not an issue in 2.5, but in 2.4:
When running a large app over NFS, it crashes and dumps core.  This
takes some time, during which ps, top, and other customers of /proc
hang while they wait for the mmap_sem.  Is there an argument against
changing the
        down_write(&current->mm->mmap_sem);
in fs/binfmt_elf.c:elf_core_dump to
        down_read(&current->mm->mmap_sem);
Thanks,
Chad
