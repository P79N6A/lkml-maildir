It is not supposed to.
There is a bug in 2.5, with a fix from Linus currently in bitkeeper.  I
have attached the patch.

# This is a BitKeeper generated patch for the following project:

#	arch/i386/kernel/irq.c	1.17    -> 1.18

# The following is the BitKeeper ChangeSet Log
# --------------------------------------------
# 02/09/04	torvalds@home.transmeta.com	1.611
# Fix IO-APIC edge IRQ handling. IRQ_INPROGRESS was cleared spuriously
# if a new edge happened while we were still processing the previous
# one.
# 
# Then, if a _third_ edge came in, it would actually cause a reentrant
# irq handler invocation, because the original INPROGRESS bit was now
# lost.
# 
# This was actually seen on IDE in PIO mode.
