The .config does not compile under mm. Could you verify that the first 
patchset applies (this one) and works fine before we get to to the 
patchset that deals with relocating the percpu addresses?
Seems that there are some other funky features on:
CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START=0x100000
CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y
CONFIG_PHYSICAL_ALIGN=0x200000
I gotta see how much of that is available under mm and how it interacts 
with the relocation of the percpu area.
