No, nothing changes.
I tested a bit more; I currently have 2.6.18.1, 2.6.18.2 and 2.6.19-rc5 
installed. Booting after "poweroff" is OK from within all versions - there is 
no delay. Resuming after suspend under 2.6.18.x is mostly OK, at least it is 
much less obvious (I had some feeling it may have been "a bit slower" under 
2.6.18.2 but may be it is just illusion). Resuming after suspend under 
2.6.19-rc5 results in noticeable delay and constantly busy HDD LED during 
grub phase.
Yes, it is notebook. I will test Pavel's suggestion later.
