OK, so you want /dev/console to fall back to /dev/null, right?

Well, you're right that if the user specifies _no_ console= option at all, the
`first one in the linked list' will be used, which is the last one registered.
Usually (read: if enabled) tty0 registers automatically, and it's the only one.
Saying e.g. `console=ttyS0' causes the serial console to register itself (at
the head of the list).
Saying e.g. `console=tty0' afterwards causes the VT console to move back to the
head of the list.
So _if_ there are multiple struct consoles activated, order (read: policy) does
matter. But usually there's only one, and all others are explicitly to be
enabled with console=.
Anyway, I should cook up a patch so the /dev/console demux walks the list if
the one at the head of the list doesn't do input (read: it has no associated
tty struct).
