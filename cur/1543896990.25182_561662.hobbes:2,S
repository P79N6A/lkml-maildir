Last oops log was with tainting (as subject reflects), before that i've
saw ext3 and "run fsck" reply. Thus, really clean oops log with all
details, not that you have just posted may be useful.

OK, i see now you are in Windows now, but i will try to ask you about

probably network stressing could trigger that. And clean *one* test
script and no X (or other stuff) will surely help.
