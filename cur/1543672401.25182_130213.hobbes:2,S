           Summary: machine check handler can deadlock
    Kernel Version: all 2.4, 2.5
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: mbligh@aracnet.com
         Submitter: ak@suse.de
The machine check handler calls printk but does not honour cli/sti. When an MCE
happens inside a critical section of printk it'll deadlock.
(bug is in x86-64 too, probably other platforms)
