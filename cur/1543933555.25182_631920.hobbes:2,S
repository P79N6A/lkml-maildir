Hi All,
I am working with pxamci driver(2.6.22.1). I have made , core and host
as  separate modules.
what is the correct order of loading the modules
i am doing in this order first core (mmc_core.ko), then card(mmc_block.ko)
after that host driver ( pxamci.ko). Is this correct.
I do not know much about Linux device model.
i saw that pxamci.ko driver registers it self as platform_driver. When
does its probe function is called. Is it called immediately  after
platform_driver_register(&pxamci_driver) is called.
also in card driver (mmc_block.ko) in block.c  file i saw a probe
function(mmc_blk_probe). How does it is invoked .
Thanks in advance for your help.
