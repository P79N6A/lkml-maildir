Hi,
Its a 256 megs machine.. Celeron 800..
I tried using mem=255M or mem=200M and it did not change anything and
still crashed. The celeron A22e seems to have the same bios as the A21e...
Btw, I received it as part of a ThinkPad University program (laptop at
school) from IBM with the old mandrake installed. And they IS guy of the
university told us that they didnt install the latest released because IBM
had not approved it... IBM probably already knows of the problem... So a
message to IBM and IBMers: Why dont you fix your known bugs?
Also it works correctly in w2k, but win2k uses ACPI and not APM (and it
has a IBM pm driver...)
