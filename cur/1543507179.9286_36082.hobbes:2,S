Hi,
I have a new UDMA drive (Just because it's big) in a relatively old
computer. It is the slave drive to an WD31600 drive. That WD drive is
on a blacklist, although it DMA-ed just fine with me before it got on
that blacklist.
Anyway, once I start putting data onto my Maxtor 92720U8, it usualy
reports "timeout waiting for DMA complete IRQ, disabeling DMA" after a
while and continues in PIO mode.
Can this be related to the WD drive? Should I swap them around
(i.e. make the Maxtor the master)? Will that help? The second IDE bus
is not available for one of these drives. So "why don't you put the
Maxtor on the second IDE bus" is not an option.
Machine: P120, 32Mb RAM.
Kernel:  2.2.9 and 2.2.10
I should one day make the machine boot off the new disk, and throw
away the old disk, but I just can't find the time to do that... Of
course, the new disk is filling up quickly, and where do you leave
that 27G while repartitioning... :-)
				Roger.
