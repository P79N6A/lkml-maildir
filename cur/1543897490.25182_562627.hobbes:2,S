Why do I so often feel compelled to respond with "did you read what I
wrote?" on this list?
I object to your MEANINGLESS CATEGORIES.

Please explain:
a) how is bad different from pseudo?
b) how is onboard different than dedicated?
I maintain that there are exactly two categories on this axis: real
and fake. And I'd rather stomp all over this notion of other
categories you've invented now before people actually start trying to
use them.
There are also two other axes that this approach neglects. Trusted
(another boolean) and bitrate (a scalar).
