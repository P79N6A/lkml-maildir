Glad you liked it.  :) 
Smatch.pm is from the smatch.sf.net scripts page.  Smatch is a really unfinished code checker that I've been working on.  It is based on reading the papers about the Stanford checker.   
Unfortunately, after a night of sleep I realize that my script is broken for 2 reasons.  
1)  Smatch.pm is meant to track state changes down different code paths.  But unfortunately it wasn't doing that in this case; it was just going down the code without taking into consideration any if_stmts  etc.  I'm extremely embarassed about that.  Sorry.  
2)  What the Stanford checker does is print an error if one return_stmt is called while the kernel is locked and one is called while the kernel is unlocked.  This seems reasonable.
I will fix both mistakes later on this week.  Unfortunately I'm in the process of moving and looking for a job etc so I might not get to it for a bit.
regards,
dan carpenter
PS.  If you liked this script, try out my kmalloc script.  I don't think anyone besides me has successfully installed it yet, so if you have any questions I'd be glad to help.  :P  My phone number until tomorrow evening is (510) 835-7695.
