No.  It creates a list of pointers to the various pages in the user's
address range: it does not physically move any data.  Think of the
kiobuf as just a container object for the pages concerned.

No, never.  A kiobuf is a container for individual pages.  If they
happen to be contiguous then you may be able to do some optimisations on
those pages, but there is no guarantee that they will be.
