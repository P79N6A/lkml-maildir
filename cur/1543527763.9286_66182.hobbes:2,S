After extensive experimentation it turns out that the culprit is this test
        if (p->policy == SCHED_OTHER) {
                tsk = cpu_curr(best_cpu);
                if (p->avg_slice + tsk->avg_slice < cacheflush_time)
                        goto out_no_target;
        }
that was moved and changed recently.  This made Linux more aggressive about
exploiting idle CPUs and apparently lat_ctx likes to execute on 1 CPU. 
Putting the above code back makes 2.3.47 a tad faster than 2.3.40.  dbench
remains miserable.
