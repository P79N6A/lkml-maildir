Been there done that, got the scars to prove it.  do_div() is a
macro that acts sortof like the ISO C99 lldiv(3) function.
Except it does unexpected things like modify its arguments... 
Most places in the kernel using do_div() not because it is the
right thing to do, but because they tried to do something
seemingly simple such as:
    u64 foo, bar, baz;
    ...
    baz = foo / bar;
and then got an error that __udivdi3 was undefined.  So the
authors then go hunting for a way to do a 64 bit division and
find do_div()...
See mm/vmscan.c, mm/shmem.c, fs/proc/proc_misc.c,
drivers/ide/ide-disk.c, etc, etc, etc, for plenty of examples of
_exactly_ this sort of thing.  Every one of them is using
do_div() to perform 64 bit division.  Not becase that is the
right thing to do, but because __udivdi3 is missing.
