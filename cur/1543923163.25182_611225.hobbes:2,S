Hi!
Regarding all the technical stuff (documentation, coding style, etc.) -
I thought I did it correctly :( I will fix it ASAP, 
and send an update when I will finish it.
About your question: today, some of the hypervisors are using linux
kernel as their domain-0 (e.g. Xen). In order
to implement direct hardware access for these native domains (e.g.
running windows in a virtual machine above Xen),
the PCI memory regions should be aligned at-least at the page-level (so,
a virtual machine - can't see data of other
devices which may not be assigned to it). So, for that reason, we wanted
a boot parameter to let us force the kernel
to align PCI memory regions at-least at a PAGE_SIZE alignment. It is
very useful for hypervisors which are developed 
at Linux environment (e.g.: Xen).
I hope I made myself clear.
Barak

Please don't declare externs in a .c file, put it in a header file.

Please follow the proper coding style rules as documented in
Documentation/CodingStyle.  Also running the script scrips/checkpatch.pl
would have pointed this out.

All command line paramaters need to be documented in the Documentation

Now for the main reason.  I really don't understand why this is needed.
Is it only for virtual machines?  Are there drivers in the kernel tree
today that need this functionality?  What breaks if you do not align
these resources?
