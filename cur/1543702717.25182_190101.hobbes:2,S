Hi,
I think the following is a bug that can affect kernels patched with
lowlatency, such as Audio and RedHat AS2.1.
lowlatency patch added conditional_schedule() to be called from
close_files() at kernel/exit.c, which seems to raise a problem if the
process had LDT entries.
If it had LDT, at the stage of close_files() the tsk->mm already zeroed
(__exit_mm(), which comes before __exit_files() in do_exit()).  If
conditional_schedule() at close_files() will succeed, switching back into
this process (that now have zeroed tsk->mm) will fail since the kernel will
not use the right LDT (since tsk->mm was zeroed, so switch_mm() will not be
called to load the LDT at schedule()).
Switching back to a process that had a register that used the LDT will fail
since the register probably points to non-valid LDT entry (since we are
using the wrong LDT), which will lead to a segmentation fault.
