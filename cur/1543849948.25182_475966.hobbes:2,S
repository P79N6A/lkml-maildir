The kernel itself links GPL code to non-GPL via the Posix API (the
syscall layer).  The kernel also links GPL code to non-GPL via the PCI
layer (all that proprietary firmware on the other side).  The
ndiswrapper links GPL code to non-GPL via the NDIS API.
No difference, really.  Implementing a well-defined interface
abstraction layer doesn't make either side of it derived from the other.
(Exactly how well-defined, how abstract, and how derived are all
arguments for the lawyers.)
