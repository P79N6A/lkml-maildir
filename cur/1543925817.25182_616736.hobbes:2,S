For Nvidia devices those would only be present if there were problems
with the AHCI hardware right, which would mean you could simply tell us
what workarounds to implement.

I agree we must be careful, for example we should put the controller back
into its boot mode before suspending so that we can reasonably expect the
BIOS to handle suspend/resume. And we certainly need an override option
in one direction or the other.
Nevertheless you don't make progress by limiting yourself to avoid
breaking the most ancient system. We gave up having a man walking in front
of cars with a red flag a long time ago.
