ok, so the zone solution it has to be. I.e. the moment it's a separate 
special zone, you can boot with most of the RAM being in that zone, and 
you are all set. It can be used both for hugetlb allocations, and for 
other PAGE_SIZE allocations as well, in a highmem-fashion. These HPC 
setups are rarely kernel-intense.
Thus the only dynamic sizing decision that has to be taken is to 
determine the amount of 'generic kernel RAM' that is needed in the 
worst-case. To give an example: say on a 256 GB box, set aside 8 GB for 
generic kernel needs, and have 248 GB in the hugemem zone. This leaves 
us with the following scenario: apps can use up to 97% of all RAM for 
hugemem, and they can use up to 100% of all RAM for PAGE_SIZE 
allocations. 3% of RAM can be used by generic kernel needs. Sounds 
pretty reasonable and straightforward from a system management point of 
view. No runtime resizing, but it wouldnt be needed, unless kernel 
activity needs more than 8GB of RAM.
