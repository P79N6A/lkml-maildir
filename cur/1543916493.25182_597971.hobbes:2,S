Hmm.  I can imagine Mondo-Boxen-R-Us folks getting upset with that.
Better would be like Ingo said, see if we can toss sync_vrintime(), and
I've been playing with that...
I found something this morning, and as usual, the darn thing turned out
to be dirt simple.  With sync_vruntime() disabled, I found queues with
negative min_vruntime right from boot, and went hunting.  Adding some
instrumentation to set_task_cpu() (annoying consequences), I found the
below:
Legend:
vrun: tasks's vruntime
old: old queue's min_vruntime
new: new queue's min_vruntime
result: what's gonna happen

A task which hasn't run in long enough for queues to have digressed
further than it's vruntime is going to end up with a negative vruntime.
Looking at place_entity(), it looks like it's supposed to fix that up,
but due to the order of arguments passed to max_vrintime(), and the
unsigned comparison therein, it won't.
Running with the patchlet below, my box _so far_ has not become
terminally unhappy despite spread0.  I'm writing this with the pinned
hogs test running right now, and all is well, so I _think_ it might be
ok to just remove sync_vruntime() after all.
