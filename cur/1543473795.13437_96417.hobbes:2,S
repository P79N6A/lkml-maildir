This is probably the 'more correct' value, because you read from
the cache.

This is not from the cache, but what you wrote to the disk.

By that you probably mean, more md5summing gives the same wrong value.
I had a similar problem, which took some time to chase down.
The ide cable for the second controller had no devices attached
and was working like an antenna, interfering with the first channel.
During hard disk writes sometimes 2 bytes got duplicated (a spike on a
control line probably). Later with a new sector the shift
was lost. So the file length were correct.
I got rid of the second cable, and voila, no more problems.
I would check the ide cable setup for your box.
