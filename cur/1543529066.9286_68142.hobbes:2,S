I know several people on this list who have received the Caldera IPO Invitation E-mail.  If there is anyone out there who is unable to participate because of residency restrictions, lack of funds, or just because the deadline for opening an account has passed, please e-mail me.  I have a plan that will allow both of us to benefit from this.  The absolute deadline is March 10, so please respond quickly.
