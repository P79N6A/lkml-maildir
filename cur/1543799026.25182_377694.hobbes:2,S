The cosim stuff has been nuked, as it was old code anyway.  With those
functions gone, we now use int32_t (and related 8-, 16-, 32- and 64-bit
signed and unsigned versions) consistently throughout the code.  We'd
prefer to keep it that way, instead of changing over to s32 and friends,
as some of our header files are used by userland programs.  Unless we
put in magic typedef for s32 and friends in userland, that won't work,
hence we use the C standard typedefs.
Is this a problem?
Regards,
 Robert.
