Subject: [PATCH] kmod.c, 2.4.0-test6 pre1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Sorry if you already got this, but my last two messages on this subject
were kind of vague. The problem is that on line 111 of kmod.c, it passes
an incompatible pointer (current) to free_uid (free_uid expects a
pointer to a user_struct, not a task_struct). I changed this to
free_uid(current->user) and everything is running smoothly. My patch is
included below.
