The problem with ECN, unlike path MTU discovery, is not stupid
administrators who set the wrong things in the firewall; rather it is
stupid firewal/content-switch/intrusion-detector implementations.       
With Sally's and KK's clout and enough noise from users vendors will fix
this.
CISCO has already done it. Raptor is next. Nortel products do/will not  
have this problem. 
There is no reason to make the deployment more complex than it is and i am
not sure how wise it is to make the Mark Handley extension part of the
RFC. Not just because of complexity, but also because of holes such as the
one Andi points out.
