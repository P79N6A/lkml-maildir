Well, it comes from parisc drivers.  Here you'd really rather have consistent 
memory because it's more efficient, but on certain platforms it's just not 
possible.
In the drivers that do this, it leads to this type of awfulness:
consistent = 1;
if(!mem = pci_alloc_consistent() {
	mem = __get_free_pages
	mem = pci_map_single()
	consistent = 1;
}
....
if(!consistent)
	dma_cache_wback()
etc.
The idea is that this translates to
mem = dma_alloc_consistent(... DMA_CONFORMANCE_NON_CONSISTENT)
...
dma_sync_single(mem..)
Where if you have consistent memory then the sync is a nop.

Yes, I think the above makes this point.  I'll change the names.
