Here are some errors I came across with 2.3.28. 
After booting my first console repeativly prints accept:Transport endpoint
is not connected.
The second error is 
drivers/block/block.a(piix.o): In function `piix_dmaproc':
piix.o(.text+0x563): undefined reference to `ide_dmaproc'
This only occurs when I have PIIXn Tuning support
Now for a question. Is anyone working on coverting zorro bus management to
the new resource management code?
Thanks.
