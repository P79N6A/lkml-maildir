The problem (well: bug) is that in_atomic() returns false inside a
spinlock when CONFIG_PREEMPT=n.  The code as it stands can sleep
inside a spinlock, which is deadlockable if a scheduled-to task
tries to take the same spinlock.
There is no means like this by which a piece of code can determine
whether it can call schedule().  The pattern which we use in many many
places (most especially GFP_KERNEL/GFP_ATOMIC) is to pass a flag down
to callees telling them in some manner which context they were called from.
