usr/klibc/Kbuild:
libc-$(CONFIG_KLIBC_ZLIB)    += \
         zlib/adler32.o zlib/compress.o zlib/crc32.o zlib/gzio.o \
         zlib/uncompr.o zlib/deflate.o zlib/trees.o zlib/zutil.o \
         zlib/inflate.o zlib/infback.o zlib/inftrees.o zlib/inffast.o
At this point, this is required by kinit, which is why it is not 
possible to disable.

That's correct; I went around and talked to both x86 and sparc people, 
and the x86 people uniformly announced rdev support as being obsolete; 
the sparc people, however, continue to rely on being able to get data 
from openprom.

True.  Git could work this out.
I have been reluctant to spend too much time on packaging, because I've 
still had the issue of continue to maintain the out-of-tree distribution 
(which includes usr/Kbuild) indefinitely.  I need to spend some more 
time scripting.
