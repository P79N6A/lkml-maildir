hi,
i need to mount partitions in an hdimage file (DOS disklabel).
is there any chance to do this ? perhaps with the loopdev (define the
mapping region) ?
but how to find out where the partitions start and end in a portable way
?
is it possible to use the code, which manages the partitions on ide and
scsi device
on loop devices ?
bye,
ew.
PS: please anwer me direct.
