We've had this discussion before, haven't we? And all the solutions
seemed to involve not having just one person approve things, which isn't
likely to change. I don't recall seeing WHEN it was sent to Linus, but
clearly something working in 2.4 and not in 2.6 probably shouldn't wait
years for 2.8.
I guess the real question is how invasive it is, this isn't the first
time I've heard that 2.6 ISDN doesn't work, so it's not as if putting it
in -mm would break ISDN, the question is how many other things are
touched and might break.
At least it seems to have been widely tested, and is based on something
which is in a stable kernel. A maintainer's lot is not a happy one, and
you have my sympathy.
Maybe leave it in -mm for a bit and not promote it until people have a
chance to really beat on it?
