Does this happen when you run the kernel on top of VMWare, as far as I
understand? If so, it is likely that VMWare is not simulating the
behavior of cpuid regarding HT support (especially, mapping between
logical and processor package). Then, you should get the same result
even when you run 2.6.6 kernel. Do you have dmesg output from some older
kernel or 2.6.6?
