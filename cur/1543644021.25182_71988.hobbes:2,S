dscc4 maintainer:
I use a code marrying the core 2.4.x dscc4 with a 2.5.x hdlc to test 2.5.x
dscc4. Thus no real extra load. Hdlc glue in current 2.4.x dscc4 does its 
job but I wouldn't recommend it as a model for the newer generation.
dscc4 users:
Migration from specific scctool.c + sethdlc to single sethdlc. Definitely
a simpler life.
If users damn me, I'll surely meet someone from Infineon in hell to discuss
dscc4 :o)
vendors:
- dscc4 not included in rh 2.4 last time I looked at it (I labelled it
  'EXPERIMENTAL');
- 2.4.18 mdk kills it using Krzysztof's post-2.4-didn't-make-2.5 (!) hdlc;
- don't know what the others do.
Imho dscc4 doesn't need to be taken too much in consideration regarding
2.4.x hdlc stack change.
