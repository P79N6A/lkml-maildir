Kernel patch set jp7 based on Linux kernel 2.4.19-pre2 released
What is it?
The -jp kernels are development kernels for testing purpose only. 
They will appear regularly two or three times a month. Their purpose 
is to provide a service for developers who can't keep up to date with 
the latest kernel and patch versions, but want to test new features 
and evaluate enhancements that are not to be expected for inclusion 
into the mainstream 2.4 kernel.
You want to test the kernel patch set? Download the standard kernel 2.4.18,
and apply the jp7 set.
You are missing a patch? Patches will be added by request.
You run into problems? Send me a mail and I will try to fix the problem.
I want to get the jp kernels as much as stable I can.
You feel happy with a jp kernel? Just let me know if my work is good for you.
On my system I only use jp kernels. So, some minor features are specific
to Dell Inspiron laptops.

Known Problems
In jp6, crypted home directories did not work. This is untested in jp7.
The Alsa backport produces kernel messages while running xmms with mp3's: 
Mar  8 23:58:41 jungle kernel: ALSA pcm_lib.c:118: Unexpected hw_pointer 
value (stream = 0, delta: -1024, max jitter = 8192): wrong interrupt 
acknowledge?
I don't know what is happening, but it seems there is no effect, since
audio is good and uninterrupted. It's always noticed in full minute 
intervals but not regularly. If anyone can give me a hint?
