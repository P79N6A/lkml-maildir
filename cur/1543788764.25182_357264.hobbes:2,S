Since patch is against -mm, please, add 2 entries to
Documentation/ioctl-mess.txt. Don't bother with "I: " and "O: ", since
they aren't finished yet.

Please, mark on-disk structures with __le{16,32,64}. It would help
typechecking with sparse.

Confusing names and implementation. CP{IN,OUT}_08 do memcpy, the rest
doesn't. "08" doesn't make sense in CPIN_08, while "16", ... do.
CPIN_64() expect fixed-endian value or host-endian? Answer is not
obvious until you look at a header. Fingers really want to type CPU
every time. I ask you to write a simple script and drop these macros
completely.
