ok, so this presents a bit of a problem in that case (assuming I'm 
understanding you) - I'm working backwards in this respect, as I'm 
using the "new" version of glibc, and an older version of the kernel 
than the one that glibc was told to remain compatible with - the 
important question, is does this order of operations (possibly) break 
things, or does the fact that I compiled the kernel on this new version 
of glibc remove any issues.
thanks,
