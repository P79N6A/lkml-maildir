there's no vsyscall branch hit, and no switch_to hit, just a single
unlikely branch in switch_to, that's minor overehad, for istance the
segmentation checks (as well unlikely) are more expensive.

switch_to only gets an additional check, the real hit it takes is when
Jeff revirtualizes the vsyscalls, not when you run in production w/o uml
or with uml in speed-mode without vsyscall revirtualization.

I prefer not to have branches in vgettimeoday, it is better to have a
single branch in switch_to where it is certainly hidden in the scheduler
and generic context switch noise, infact if we put in the right place it
could have zero l1 cache impact, gettimeofday call frequency may be very
high, much higher than the context switch frequency and the size of the
gettimeofday is much smaller than the one of the scheduler, so there's
less stuff to hide the branch in the noise.

you're optimizing the system for strace? What's the point of optimizing
strace and penalizing the normal syscall fast path?
