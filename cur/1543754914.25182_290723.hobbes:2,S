I now remember another reason for it: upgrades. SUSE always did it this
way (It goes back many moons to 2.2 based kernels when the UP APIC code
was added). It would be probably rather fragile to change this
automatically during an update.
I realize this isn't a big concern for mainline, but given that
people are always complaining about distributions having too many
patches it may be still good to add it to mainline because 
the SUSE kernel has it. Unless people think it is totally unsuitable (?),
but I don't think it is that bad.
Also I must add in addition to the CONFIG there are valuable bugfixes
in there too.
