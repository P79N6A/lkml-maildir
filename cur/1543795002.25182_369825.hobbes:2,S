It's not such a pressing need IMO. This stuff works, doesn't
need a lot of maintenance, is not too big code size wise, so why
should it be converted ASAP?
As discussed on "PCI core patch" thread, getting specs from
hardware vendors for new stuff is getting harder. When one suddenly
discovers than [s]he cannot run X on shiny new notebook -
_this_ is a serious problem.
