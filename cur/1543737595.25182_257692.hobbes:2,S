Yes, indeed.  It's just picky about which one.  Something I meant to
mention: I do not allow clock_settime on CPU timers, because I don't know
of any worthwhile reason to want to support it.  You get EINVAL or EFAULT
if your arguments are bogus, and EPERM if they are valid.  This is the
POSIX-compliant error code choice.
Thanks,
Roland
