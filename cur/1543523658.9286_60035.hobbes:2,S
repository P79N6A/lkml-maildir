   That would work.
   I'd prefer a postfix notation that separates out major and minor
   numbers, like so:
   hda 03 00-39
   hdb 03 40-79
   hde 21 00-39
   hdf 21 00-40
   sda 08 00-09
   Because that would explicitly show the major and minors, instead
   of having to rely on hidden magic to partition the majorspace.
   And, actually, while I'm dreaming, I'd love to have it be:
   device type major minors
   hda    b    03    00-39
   hdb    b    03    40-79
   hde    b    21    00-39
   hdf    b    21    00-40
   sda    b    08    00-09
   (Yes, the ``device type ...'' is part of the format.  Why?  Because if
   this information is included, it's trivial to build a scanner that
   can pick up the information properly even if the format is shuffled
   or fields are added.   I think this is how snmp data is returned,
   and that's the one nice thing in that bodge of a standard.)
                 ____
   david parsons \bi/ It's not a devfs, but this is a format I can do
                  \/  something with either in userspace or in a lkm.
