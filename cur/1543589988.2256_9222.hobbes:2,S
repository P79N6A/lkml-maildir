I suspect the ohci driver currently. I've been reviewing it a little and it
is full of code written by someone who does not know about pci write posting.
Specifically
	writel(value, pciaddr)
is a queued operation. So 
	writel(value, foo)
	delay
	real(foo)
might not do the writel into the delay is over or during it. PCI makes 
guarantees that
-	writes will go out in order and will be merged only if prefetchable set
-	multiple writes to the same addr will remain multiple writes
-	reads will not complete until the writes do
This applies in both directions - bus mastering nasties abound notably
	writel(STOP, reg->dmactrl)
	kfree(buffer)
is dangerous 
	You have to do
	writel(STOP, reg->dmactrl);
			[posted]
	readl(reg->dmactrl)
			[read forces write, read reply will follow any DMA
			 pending the other way]
I've not attempted to fix it yet
