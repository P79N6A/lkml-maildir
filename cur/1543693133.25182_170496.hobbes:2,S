Aaaah.  Close.  It was "Gameport Support" that dunnit.  This laptop doesn't
  have such on it, so I thought I'd give it a whirl sans, especially since
  I'm trying to figure out why stuff is locking up on it.
Seems like an odd dependency.  You know why that is set up so?
Thankye.

"Asked by CollabNet CTO Brian Behlendorf whether Microsoft will enforce its
 patents against open source projects, Mundie replied, 'Yes, absolutely.'
 An audience member pointed out that many open source projects aren't
 funded and so can't afford legal representation to rival Microsoft's. 'Oh
 well,' said Mundie. 'Get your money, and let's go to court.' 
Microsoft's patents only defensive?
