I am looking for any information that may help in getting my Radeon PCI
card working in linux with acceloration.
I am in the process of trying to obtain information from ATI about the
chipset but apart from that I haven't been successful in any other way
except I have determined the card becomes locked and often its FIFO read
pointer is occassionally at 0 when it has locked (with the FIFO write
pointer often several kilobytes ahead of it).
I have had no luck with DRI or XFree86 people as PCI support for Radeons
on x86 platform isn't a priority at this time.
The suggestion is that the problem is in the DRM but I can't find
information confirming that in the lkml at this time.
If you do have any information/patches that could help for the x86
platform could you please CC me as I am not on the lkml due to its
traffic volume.
I am determined to have this fixed so please help if you can.
Thank you in advance
Chris Ison
