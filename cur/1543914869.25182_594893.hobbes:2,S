On i86_64 (but I think the arch does not matter).
make defconfig
make menuconfig
At top-level menu I see:
--- Enable the block layer  --->
In block/Kconfig we have:
menuconfig BLOCK
       bool "Enable the block layer" if EMBEDDED
       default y
If EMBEDDED == n then we see the above.
And this was my first experience with this patch - and it
took me some thoughts to realise it was the "if EMBEDDED" part
that made it look like -*-
So maybe not something we see in many places but it is
there in the top-level menu.
