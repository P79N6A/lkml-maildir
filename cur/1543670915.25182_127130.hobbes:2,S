Hi!
I've found a reproducable bug in ext3 on my notebook. This gets hit
under 2.4.19-ac4 and 2.4.20.1 (or whatever you want to call the
patches from hardrock.org).
Before I dive into the code, what is the most recent ext3 code that I
could update to? 2.4.21-rc1? Are any of the patches from
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/2.4/2.4.20/
 missing? Is
there more unreleased code?
Jörn
