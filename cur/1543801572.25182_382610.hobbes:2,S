so I might got the wrong impression, because it seemed you put a lot of
thinking into the /dev/wlanX stuff without even considering netlink or
something else.

At the OLS last year, I think the consensus was to use netlink for all
configuration task. However this was mainly driven by Harald Welte and
he might be able to talk about the pros and cons of netlink versus a
character device.

I am all for it, because I don't like dummy Ethernet devices that are
only used for configuration. I am still not happy that IrDA uses irda0
to get somekind of packet management etc. instead of implementing a real
suitable hardware abstraction.
