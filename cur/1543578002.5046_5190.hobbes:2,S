Just marking them with a special "do not deactivate me"
bit seems to work fine enough. When this special bit is
set, we simply move the page to the back of the active
list instead of deactivating.
And when the bit changes again, the page can be evicted
from memory just fine. In the mean time, the locked pages
will also have undergone normal page aging and at unlock
time we know whether to swap out the page or not.
I agree that this scheme has a higher overhead than your
idea, but it also seems to be a bit more flexible and
simple.  Alternatively, we could just scan the wired_list
once a minute and move the unwired pages to the active
list.

Rik
