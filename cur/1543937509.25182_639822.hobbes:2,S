Yes I can confirm this, changed MFGPT_MAX_TIMERS from 7 to 8 in the old
kernel and it still works.

Great analysis! I think I can confirm this too. I tried the following:
First in mfgpt_timer_setup I commented out "clockevents_register_device"
result: the system still hangs with "registering the MFGT timer as a
clock event" !
Then I also commented out "ret = setup_irq(irq, &mfgptirq)".
result: system boots, voila!
However the vendor claims that 7 should be used (from the bios changelog):
"v0.90 (IRQ7 is no longer directed to the LPC bus, used as a default
interrupt for MFGPT high resolution timer."
There is also a interrupt map in the bios[0] readme:
IRQ0    timer
IRQ1    KBD (LPC)
IRQ2    cascade
IRQ3    COM1 serial (internal / LPC)
IRQ4    COM2 serial (LPC)
IRQ5    audio (CS5536)
IRQ6    FDC (LPC)
IRQ7    spare, used for MFGPT high resolution timer
IRQ8    RTC
IRQ9    PCI INTA
IRQ10   PCI INTB
IRQ11   PCI INTC
IRQ12   PCI INTD
IRQ13   floating point
IRQ14   IDE HDD
IRQ15   USB (CS5536)
/proc/interrupts on a running system looks like this:
           CPU0
  0:      12329          XT-PIC  timer
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  4:        240          XT-PIC  serial
  8:          3          XT-PIC  rtc
  9:        558          XT-PIC  wifi0
 10:      67591          XT-PIC  eth0
 11:        622          XT-PIC  wifi1
NMI:          0
ERR:          0

Watchdog for the new API would be great :-)

Thanks for your effort!
