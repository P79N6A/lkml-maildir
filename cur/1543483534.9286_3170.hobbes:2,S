You can tell if it feels unresponsive.  That is a valid observation, if
you can reproduce the environment exactly between boots to two separate
kernels and if the responsiveness is consistent.

Just because you don't understand the VM doesn't mean that this
behaviour is wrong!  First of all, do you really see  other kernels
behave differently?  Do you have concrete numbers to back it up?
Secondly, cache is _necessary_ to the kernel.  Every single program
running on your system works from it.  To run a binary, or to load a
shared library, it first gets loaded into cache, and then the cache
memory is doubled-up as process virtual memory.  Having 6M of cache
doesn't mean that the cache is just sitting there unused.  In "free",
the "shared" field will tell you how much sharing there is between the
cache and other processes.  If you have 6M cache and zero shared, then
yes, you have an excessive cache, but I doubt you will see that.

Looks fine to me.  The buffer cache count is good and low.  Since
buffers and cache are reclaimed by exactly the same loop in the VM, that
is a good indication that anything left in cache is actively in use by
the kernel.
