Of the kernel 2.6.22-git15 of this night,  kmem_cache_create is not compatible and causes compiling errors of some fundamental programs.  Before, this error didnt occur.
At least this happened on compiling the externel modules for btrfs and ndiskwrapper.    Principally the compatibility of the Kernel with older and new versions of the file systems have to be observed very good, for the reliability to can read dates.
Thus this should be checked, and corrected
