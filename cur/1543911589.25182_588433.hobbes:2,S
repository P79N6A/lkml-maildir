This is worrisome.  If you look at pagemap.h, it includes a pile of things
which could easily themsleves try to include tlb.h via some path or
another.  I fear that this patch will cause explosions with some config
and/or architecture.
If you like, tlb.h is a low-level sort of thing whereas pagemap.h is a
higher-level VFS thing.  It is more appropriate that pagemap.h be including
tlb.h.
So I think a better fix would be better, but I'm not able to suggest what,
as there is little detail about the failure here and I can find no mention
of page_cache_release and release_pages in asm-generic/tlb.h.  Presumably
they're getting pulled in via some macro and then instantiated in some
inline function or something?
