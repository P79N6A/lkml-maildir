You can try the attached adaptive readahead patch.
Apply it on your server and compile kernel with CONFIG_ADAPTIVE_READAHEAD.
Use large 1MB readahead on server and small readahead on clients.

The readahead code is helpless in NFSv3 :-(
Use NFS over TCP and rsize=readahead=1MB on client side could help.
But if you prefer UDP, the above patch may help you :-)
