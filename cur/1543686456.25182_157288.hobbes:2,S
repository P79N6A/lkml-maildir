Hi Marcelo,
Here is a patch against 2.4.31-bk32 that removes a compilation warning
in arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c. The warning is generated by an unused
variable that is only needed when some debugging code is turned on. The
patch fixes that. It is mainly a backport from what was made in the
2.5/2.6 kernel tree, so I take no credit for it.
The problem is not present in the 2.2 kernel tree, so no fix is needed
there.
Please apply, thanks.
Jean.
