Subject: CDR, Advansys, kernel 2.2.14 and later

I can't use my CDR with later kernels than 2.2.13.
Hardware setup:
Matsonic MS6260S motherboard
AMD K6-II/400 processor
128MB RAM
IDE disks
Advansys APB-940UW(68) SCSI card
Traxdata CDR4120 Pro CDR
Software setup:
gcc 2.7.2.3 and 2.95.2
binutils 2.9.5.0.22
Everything is fine under 2.2.13 and earlier. 2.2.14 and 2.2.15pre[1-5]
give the following:
$ mount /mnt/cdrom
The mount command hangs. In another terminal window, I get:
$ lsmod
