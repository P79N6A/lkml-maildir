Hi!
I've got a problem with my Linux box. Every now and then, the system
just hangs. Sometimes, this happens after 20 minutes, sometimes the
system crashes after an uptime of 10 days. I changed nearly every
piece of software and hardware, but the crashes continue. Meanwhile I
expect this to be a software problem. I'm currently using a SUSE 6.1
distribution and a 2.2.7 kernel. I've used different X servers with
different gfx cards. 
If this is a software problem, there is one way to find the problem:
By keeping book about the currently running process. If the crash
occurs in the same process ever and ever again, this process should be 
the bad guy (I treat the kernel as a process, too). The only cause of
crashes that is not detected by this method could be crashes that are
triggered by DMA transfers. These are unlikely if the hardware is
changed. 
What I want to know is, whether there is already some bookkeeping
feature or a patch for this available. If not, I would implement
something like this: 
The kernel writes the PID of the active process or the pseudo-PID 0 
to a serial port that runs at some high speed. When a new process is
created, the name and parameters of this process are written to the
line, too. On my machine, there are 100 timer interrupts per second. 
Other interrupts happen more seldom. Therefore I assume that there 
are less than 200 PIDs/second to be written out. Since a PID is
four bytes, it fits in the FIFO and the data rate of about 800 bytes
per second should be no problem.
What do you think about this approach? 
Ciao,
Tobias
