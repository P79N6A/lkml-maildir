Declaring something as deprecated doesn't automatically convert the 
in-kernel users.
And once there are no in-kernel users left you can kill it immediately.
The only working way for getting rid of list_for_each_rcu() is:
- send patches for all in-kernel usages to the maintainers of the code
  in question now
- once all of these patches have entered Linus' tree (which might not
  be before the 2.6.26 merge window) you can remove list_for_each_rcu()
