How about Marcelo's policy that the -final version should differ from
the last -rc only in the Makefile VERSION and nothing else (well,
documentation perhaps if someone else has proofread it).
Would you be ready to have the last -rc out for, say, five days, before
releasing the official, final, blessed, however 2.6.9, in order to catch
the showstoppers?
