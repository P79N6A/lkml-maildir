One kernel thread can run in only one CPU at once. Exactly as bh handlers.
And bh handlers can run over all cpus but only one CPU can run the bh
handlers at once.
So basically you should have smp_num_cpus kernel threads to scale better
than bh and you'll pay the scheduling cost.

The point is that while inside the kernel you'll held at least one lock
for most of the time. So it would be no scheduling gain IMHO as to
schedule you should unlock something by hand anyway (right now it's
unlock; conditional schedule; lock).
