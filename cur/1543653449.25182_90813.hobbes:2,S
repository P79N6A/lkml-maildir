okay, my brain really shrinks; with only one hdd attached, you can't create an 
array. So here it seems to work out of the box. I just tried 2.4.20-rc-ac1, 
which detects my drive connected to that hpt374 (hde).
Maybe you can give this one a try?
Are using the latest BIOS for your mobo? About a week ago there was a new one 
posted, somewhere at epox.com...
