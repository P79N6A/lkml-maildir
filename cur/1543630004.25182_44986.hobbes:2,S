We want to expose all the zerocopy infrastructure to
userspace so all relevant applications can benefit.
The concern with moving one (major) application into the
kernel is that this will weaken the testing/motivation to get
zerocopy, aio and sophisticated notifications working well
for userspace.
Everyone who cares will end up implementing things as
TUX modules.
