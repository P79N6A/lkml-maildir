Subject: XF86-4 dies with DRM  (Re: Linux-2.4.0-test6)

I have a 3DFX Voodoo3.
When I enable DRM support in XFree86 4.0.1 with 2.4.0-test6, startx, then
hop out to a text console, if I wait a little bit X will die with a:
Fatal server error:
Caught signal 11.  Server aborting
Putting the X server in 24 bit mode (and thus preventing DRM from
functioning in the 3DFX driver) is enough to keep X alive.
I remember having this problem before.  I thought it was fixed, but
perhaps I just stopped using the DRM stuff because of other problems of
having drm and agp both compiled into the kernel.
