Agreed.
rwlock got bad performance some case. (especially on many cpu machine)
if many cpu grab read-lock on and off on many cpu system.
then at least 1 cpu always grab read lock and the cpu of waiting write-lock 
never get lock.
threrefore, rwlock often make performance weakness of stress.
I want know testcase for this patch and run it.
Do you have it?
