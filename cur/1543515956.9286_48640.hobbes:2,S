	Thanks for putting it together, but sorry, no.
	When I came up in 2.3.27-final plus zoned-2.3.27-E1, I got a very
constant stream of "allocated page" printk's They continued even after I
logged in (blind).
	When I commented out the printk and came up in that kernel, the
system booted successfully, but the problem persisted - it refused to go
below 15.2M free.
	Here's a sample of the printk's *1:
Nov 12 13:41:14 sparrow kernel: Loaded 6237 symbols from /boot/System.map.
Nov 12 13:41:14 sparrow kernel: Symbols match kernel version 2.3.27.
Nov 12 13:41:14 sparrow kernel: Loaded 85 symbols from 4 modules.
Nov 12 13:41:14 sparrow kernel: 8000.
Nov 12 13:41:14 sparrow kernel: allocated page c1080a00, c2028000.
Nov 12 13:41:14 sparrow last message repeated 3 times
Nov 12 13:41:14 sparrow kernel: allocated page c1088f00, c223c000.
Nov 12 13:41:14 sparrow kernel: allocated page c1091a40, c2469000.
Nov 12 13:41:14 sparrow kernel: allocated page c108a2c0, c228b000.
Nov 12 13:41:14 sparrow kernel: allocated page c1079f00, c1e7c000.
...
	Should zoned-E1 also have had the changes to init.c as well?
	The system log did _not_ have any of the "returning NULL page..."
or "setting nr_zones..." printks, but did have:
Nov 12 14:03:45 sparrow kernel: zone 0, size 00001000
Nov 12 14:03:45 sparrow kernel: zone 1, size 00001830
	, which would seem to match the
totalpages: 00002830
	at boot.
	Cheers,
	- Bill
