Subject: [PATCH] Fix for handling bad IPMI DMI data
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Ignore the bottom bit of the base address from the DMI data.  It
is supposed to be set to 1 if it is I/O space.  Few systems do this,
but this enables the ones that do set it to work properly.
