Yes, that could easily be arranged.  I've tried to be careful and
nowhere asssume that the regular caps were precisely numbers 32
through 63.

I'll do this now for version 0.4.2, which merges with your own
filesystem support.  I made one noteworthy change to your code, by the
way, which is to disable the "permitted" (=forced) set of capabilities
on executables whose filesystem is mounted nosuid: I think this is a
reasonable constraint, to avoid the attack where a luser mounts a usb
key with xattrs in the filesystem or something like that.
