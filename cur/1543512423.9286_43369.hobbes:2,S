and which lock protects "mm->rss"?
It's not an atomic variable, but
* increased by do_swap_page() outside lock_kernel.
* decreased by the swapper.
I've started adding "assert_down()" and "assert_kernellocked()" macros,
and now I don't see the login prompt any more...
eg. sys_mprotect calls merge_segments without lock_kernel().
