Ooops. I apologize. It turns out that I didn't test this as thoroughly as I 
had thought. Although the Voodoo3 works perfectly, 16-bit and 32-bit modes  
are still broken on the Voodoo4.
Does anybody have docs on the Voodoo4/5 or know how byte-swizzling woks on 
these cards? It definitely doesn't behave the same as the Voodoo3 . . .
If nobody objects, the patch I posted previously should still be applied to 
2.4 since it does fix all the endian problems in tdfxfb with the Voodoo3.
Cheers,
Rich
