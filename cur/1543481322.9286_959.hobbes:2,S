Something similar to omirr already exists, it has been implemeted in
Irix, and is underway for FreeBSD. The userland tool is called 'webd',
and although the name implies web, it could be used extensively in other
arenas, such as a realtime tripwire. I would dearly love to see the
kernel level stuff ('fmon' under FreeBSD) be ported (in concept at
least) to Linux.. For more information see:

Or contact me directly.
