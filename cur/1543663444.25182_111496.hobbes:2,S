Er, actually they make the card detect pins a different length for a
reason -- not just so they look pretty :) 
You are guaranteed a certain amount of time between the card detect
firing to signal removal, and the actual disconnection of the device.
And you can't rely on getting 0xFF; sometimes your box just locks up
hard if you try to access the missing hardware any time after the
'warning period' has expired and the device has actually gone.
Admittedly that's a fairly screwed box -- but I have them and was
expected to make them userproof.
