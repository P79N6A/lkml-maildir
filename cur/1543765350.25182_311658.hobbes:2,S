Dear diary, on Wed, Apr 13, 2005 at 07:01:34PM CEST, I got a letter
where Daniel Barkalow <barkalow@iabervon.org> told me that...

How is it unhappy? That would likely be a bug, unless you do something
which really *needs* the tree populated and doesn't make sense otherwise
(show-diff aka git diff w/o arguments, for example).
Given that what would you copy with cp -r and wipe shortly after
(objects db) is likely to be significantly larger than the working tree
itself, checkout-cache would be wiser anyway.

98% of the time I am right. Why worry about the other 3%.
