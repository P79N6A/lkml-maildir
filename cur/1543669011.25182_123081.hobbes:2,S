There have been multiple reports of this patch fixing starvation problems.
We need to either apply it or fix up the problem by other means.
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
the patch below fixes George's setiathome problems (as expected).  It
essentially turns off Linus' improvement, but i dont think it can be fixed
sanely.
the problem with setiathome is that it displays something every now and
then - so it gets a backboost from X, and hovers at a relatively high
priority.
