Actually I do not think that root sending SIGKILLs to kernel threads
is demented... I tried to recover broken machine by SIGKILLing
kacpid. It did not work, so I just reniced it to get machine back.

PS: BTW it was evo n620c. There's something wrong with thermal
handling after swsusp. Evo will not die by overheat, but it almost
damaged machine it was standing on... ouch. Cover got deformed by
heat (quite a bit), fortunately it returned to previous shape when it
cooled down.
