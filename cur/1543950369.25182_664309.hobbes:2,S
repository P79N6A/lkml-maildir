That was the state with older gcc, but with newer gcc it does not necessarily
reset the flag before the next function call.
so e.g. if you have
        memmove(...)
        for (... very long loop .... ) {
                /* no function calls */
                /* signals happen */
        }
the signal could see the direction flag
