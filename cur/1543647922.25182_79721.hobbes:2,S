That's a new failure mode!   Can you help narrow this down?
You're using the OHCI driver, so you can just tweak the lines at the
top of drivers/usb/host/ohci-hcd.c that can #define DEBUG.  If you
comment out that #define, and leave CONFIG_USB_DEBUG on (and then
rebuild and re-init with the new OHCI driver), does that work or not?
If that works, it'd be time to see which OHCI printk()s morph init (?)
timing enough to matter to your K7 box.   Looked to me like they were
all either before or after the timing-critical bits (chip init), so
disabling just the OHCI messages "should" not change your failure mode.
