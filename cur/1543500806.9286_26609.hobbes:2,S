I think I see part of the problem here.
You are thinking "unmount to fix problem, will remount later".
"umount -f" is more like "it's going away, dammit, and I'd rather crash
a few processes than have to take down the whole system".
It might be worthwhile having an option that causes attempted accesses
to hang until the filesystem comes back online, somewhat akin to
Auspex's filesystem "isolation".
