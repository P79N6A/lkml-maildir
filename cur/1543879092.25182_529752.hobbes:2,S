Hi Adrian,
first front off: thanks for the phantastic 2.6.16 stable maintenance.
Currently I wonder if you have any plan for doing the 2.6.16 review
for let's say "years", or if you "soon" pick some new series such as
2.6.20 or so for long-term maintenance.
I ask because I wonder if I should wait a bit with a production 2.6.17
kernel line I maintain right now for just one installation base, if you
choose some 2.6.2x I can hop on, or whether it is wiser to just downdate
this series and profit from the "long-term" 2.6.16 maintenance that is
no fun to replicate for 2.6.17 just for this one install pool ...
Thanks in advance,
