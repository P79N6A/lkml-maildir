Hi!
 I installed kernel 2.4.17 on my SMP server with 8CPU's and 8GB RAM 
 and lets just say that whenever the entire physical memory was utilised
 the box would topple over...with kswapd running a havoc on CPU utilization
 So to avoid losing control I had to reboot every 8 hours.
 But, it all changed after I applied Rik van Riels 2.4.17-rmap-11c patch
 Now, the box is happily running for the past 3 days under heavy load 
 without any problems. The RAM utilization is always at about 95% +
 but the system doesnt swap at all.....kswapd is running all the time and 
 freeing up main memory for other processes. I am quite happy with the
 performance of the box........and highly recommend Rik's patches
 for anyone else facing similar problems
 
 Thanks to all you guys, especially Rik for helping me out....
 
 Best regards,
