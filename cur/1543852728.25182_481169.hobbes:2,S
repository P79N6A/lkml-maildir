Well I'm probably missing something but I really don't see what !
For example, let say that the four first bytes of an image are 0x06,
0xe0, 0x38, 0x00.
If
	bpp = 1
	start_index = 0
	on a little endian platform 
	this patch is _not_ applied
slow_imageblit() will write into the frame buffer the following
bytes: 0x60, 0x07, 0x1c, 0x00 instead of the original ones. The bits
of each bytes have been inversed (bit7->bit0, bit6->bit1, bit5->bit2,
bit4->bit3, bit3->bit4, ...) and that's the reason why _I_ get all
fonts inverted.
With this patch applied, the bytes written into the frame buffer will
be exactly the same as the original ones. Therefore it fixes my
inverted view but broke Rafael's one.
Now, I'm very not familiar with all frame buffer stuff so I must be
missing somthing obvious. If anyone could give me some hints there
that would be nice.
Thanks
