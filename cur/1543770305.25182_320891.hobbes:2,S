Yes the kernel can read cr4. I believe the best solution is to modify
__flush_tlb_global() to read cr4's current value and mix it in when
toggling CR4.PGE and uploading mmu_cr4_features.
(But please make it conditional on CONFIG_SECCOMP.)
The code called from __switch_to() would have to set or clear cr4
locally only. That's easy using write_cr4() and read_cr4().
