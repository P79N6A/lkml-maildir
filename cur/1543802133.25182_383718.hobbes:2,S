I saw a similar issue many years ago that turned out to be a chipset bug. 
This was a PII system that used 16 bit wide modules.  When using only one 
module, the chipset "fooled" the OS into thinking that it was doing 32 bit 
wide operations.  However, it failed at full speed.  Reducing the memory bus 
speed or installing modules in pairs "fixed" the problem.  I suspect a bus 
or memory controller issue rather than the kernel.
The failure mode was exactly as you describe.  It manifested itself as disk 
errors or DMA failures.  Unfortunately the chipset vendor determined that it 
was a silicon bug and said that they would NOT fix it!
