This was fixed in the 5.2 updates. More exactly it was fixed in the 2.0.36
kernel. There are cases in earlier 2.0 kernels where in the absence of other
I/O requests the system can get full of completed but unrecovered requests
and deadlock.
Its one of those situations that simply 'doesn't happen' in anything but
an install environment. That bug should also not be present in 2.2 kernels
