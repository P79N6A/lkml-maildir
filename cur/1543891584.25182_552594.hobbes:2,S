Because otherwise you couldn't create linked lists:
struct foo {
  void* data;
  struct foo* next;
};
At that point it hasn't been defined yet but it is being used. This is
legal, so the compiler can't create a warning for that.
Which is not to say that it's a nice coding style, but that's a
different matter.
