Perhaps I didn't take enough care in emphasizing
>> I don't mean to accuse Red Hat of anything in advance of the evidence
I'm worried, but still hopeful.  For starters, Alan Cox is on the inside,
and I own T-shirts describing his opinion on software patents.
I just wanted to echo Adam Richter's statement that Red Hat's actions
are going to have broad consequences, and I hope they'll think about
them carefully.  He showed remarkable insight, and expressed it very
well.
