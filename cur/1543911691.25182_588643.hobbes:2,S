Hm,
it seems we are victim of a SATA NCQ HORKAGE:
http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-ide@vger.kernel.org/msg08936.html
Disableing NCQ seems to work on the sb600. Samsung already ships a newer
edition ("403" instead of "401")  but there is no fix for the NCQ  in
the 401 edition. With Samsungs HUTIL you cannot disbale NCQ on the disk
itself. Sadly we have about 20 pcs SAMSUNG HD401LJ of the broken one here :/
Interstingly the ncq horkage does not affect the platforms which are
ICH7-based. We replugged both harddisks to some core2quad/ICH7-based
system without any change in software - and it works without lockups. Is
that simply luck? According to dmesg NCQ is activated on the ICH7.
Is it currently only possible to ATA_HORKAGE_NONCQ generally? Or can
that be done per chipset?
Best Regards,
Andreas
@Ulrich: On what kind of chipset did you observe the horkage?
