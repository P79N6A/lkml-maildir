2.4.0-test3-pre3 adds drivers/acpi/include/config.h.  There is
already a config.h which is a generated file as well as include/config
for the exploded config options.  Using config.h for both generated and
supplied files will mess up some peoples' exclude lists.  Please use a
different name for acpi config.h.  drivers/acpi/include/acpi_config.h?
I would have sent this to R. Byron Moore but could find no email
address.
