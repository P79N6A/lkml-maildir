Subject: [PATCH][2.5] quotemarks and trailing whitespaces (1st, revisited)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

I redid the quotemark patch. Since I'm a lazy typist, I had a script which
removed all whitespaces before virtual or real newline characters. Does
this one look OK to you?
