That should be fine from a theoretical standpoint, but I can't say much
more than that - I have _great_ difficulty in reproducing the problem
with IDE and as such I consider myself out of the game of testing for
this problem:

You need to approach other members of the ARM community to test these
patches.  Unfortunately I don't have a list of who has found the problem
and who is in a state to be able to reproduce it - since most members
are embedded engineers, they tend to move on to other projects quite
rapidly.
What I suggest is that we just throw _something_ which looks right into
the kernel and see what happens.  I can't see any other possible way to
proceed, _especially_ as we've had 6 months of very little progress on
this issue.

I'm not sure what this is about...
