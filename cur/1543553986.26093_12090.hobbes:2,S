the problem is that unless your code does the save/restore of the FPU
registers you will corrupt user code that does floating point.
nothing else in the kernel is supposed to use the FPU, and as a result
(almost) no user->kernek->user transitions touch the FPU and therefor the
registers don't need to be saved.
If your code needs to use them it is your code's responsibility to get a
lock (to prevent something else from interrupting you), save teh
registers, do your work, restore the registers, and release the lock
there may not be a lock, but if not then you cannot schedule/sleep during
the time you have monkeyed with the FPU.
