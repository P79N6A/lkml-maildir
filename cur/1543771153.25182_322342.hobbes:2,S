I doubt anyone would want to do that, as soon as a script for cdrecord
gets submitted people will start submitting scripts for other tools and I
really doubt the udev maintainer has the resources or desire to maintain
dozens of scripts for tools that he doesn't use. If such scripts were to be
written they would most likely have to be maintained either by the upstream 
author or by a package maintainer for a particular distribution that wants 
to hack around the lack of Linux integration in a particular tool.
