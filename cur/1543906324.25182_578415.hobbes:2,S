Is this a DELL laptop that gets throttled by 75% to throttling state 6
if 60 degrees are exceeded?
Adrian has such a machine..., no idea what is going on with that one,
but only workaround to get any use out of this machine is to override at
least the passive trip point.

As 2.6.22 was shipped without, I think reverting is not a real option.

IMO something new should be added.
On longterm, maybe it's possible to marriage ACPI thermal control with
hwmon interface, AFAIK there are already efforts to do so, but I don't
know much about it. Still overriding trip points is a problem because
BIOS can change them at runtime... IMO it should just be possible and
machines changing them at runtime either:
  - do change the user's overrides
  - or trip points are simply fixed after user has overridden them
    -> my favorite (Don't care for hysteresis BIOS implementations,
    if user changes them, it's his fault, he doesn't need to...)
Sanity checks that trip points only can get lowered (compared to initial
provided ones) needs to be added.
Len, Rui: For short-term can something like that be added at least to
the new sysfs interface (I am willing to help if this is a "would be
nice to have, but no time, maybe later" issue)?
Especially passive trip point modification is IMO a powerful feature.
You can easily build a passive cooled system, running at the performance
level your cooling system allows (CPU frequency simply gets lowered
before fans kick in).
Other architectures than ACPI powered already make use of CPU frequency
scaling. An ACPI independent passive cooling implementation connecting
thermal control (hwmon?) and cpufreq interface should be desired for
future? (could get tricky because ACPI spec has some special needs for
passive cooling)
