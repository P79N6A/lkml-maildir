Well, if you can do it in one patch series, go ahead. But I think such
massive change all over kernel will take slightly longer, so I'd
prefer to keep the dummy argument for a while (so it still compiles)
and fix it slowly.
Of course, it is up to the person doing the series. And yes, such
series would be welcome.
