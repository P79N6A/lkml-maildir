I'm not sure if ext2 is like dos or not (hold it, I'm not finished yet). 
Back in the days that I used dos, I understood the file system fairly well. 
I also knew that when you put x amount of files in a directory, the
cirectory will grow by 1 more cluster.  Deleting all the files doesn't make
it use less space on the drive.  So if I have hundreds of files in a dir and
it's say 12k, deleting all those files won't make it smaller, it'll still be
12k.
I'm guessing on this and have never tried this on ext2.  If I'm wrong, let
me know (of course, I'm sure you will).  If I'm right, does this make sense?
