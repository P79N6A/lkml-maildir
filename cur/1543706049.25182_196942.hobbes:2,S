Yes, the allocation of the inode and data blocks should be randomized 
for security, but that would lead to performance impacts. Implementing 
that should definately be a compile time option.
I would advocate erasing all meta-data on a file, and also erasing the 
data. The end-user can be responsible for erasing the data, they can 
access it with write(), but they can't access the meta-data (not without 
directly accessing the file system). Thats why I'm putting these patches 
forward. The file system should be responsible for removing meta-data 
when a file is deleted. This secure deletion doesn't have to incorporate 
data block erasure (although my implemenation does).
Your suggestion would certainly work, but I think the performance impact 
of using random inodes and data blocks would dissuade many from having 
it enabled by default. Simple secure deletion of the data and meta-data 
would have a lower impact, and be more likely to be used on more file 
systems.
