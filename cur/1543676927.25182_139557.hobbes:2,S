Hi,
it seems that whether the netdevice nor the 8139too parts of the kernel cause 
my problems but there must have been some bad changes to the interrupt 
routing or the IO-APIC parts.
I don't have -mm7 handy currently (but at the moment it compiles again) but I 
attached the contents of /proc/interrupts of 2.4.10 (the system I currently 
run) and 2.5.70-mm8 again.
As you can see there, the -mm8 code does not assign more than 16 interrupt 
sinks but the 2.4.10 (and if I remember correctly -mm7, too) has 22. Perhaps 
even more problematic is that -mm8 seems not to use level-triggered 
interrupts...!
I could try to revert some IRQ or APIC changes if someone could tell me which 
Changeset may have caused that...
Best reagrds
