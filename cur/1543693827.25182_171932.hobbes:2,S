I concur with one caviat.  0+1 has the advantage of
extendability that doesn't exist with 1+0.
	1. break mirror downing side A
	2. break stripe A
	3. build new stripe A with added disk(s)
	4. copying stripe B to stripe A
	5. break stripe B
	6. build new stripe B with added disk(s)
	7. build mirror (A->B)
It may even be possible to do this live.  So if gradual
extendability is more important than surviving multiple
failures 0+1 has the advantage.  Normally i prefer the
reliability or to do striping at the logical volume level.
