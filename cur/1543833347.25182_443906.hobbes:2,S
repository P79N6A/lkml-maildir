Fair enough, I guess.

How much storage are we talking about here?  I find it a bit hard to work
that out.

hm.  Add a generic extension to a generic interface within a specific
subsystem versus doing it generically.  Hard call ;)
I'd suggest that you:
- Create a new __alloc_percpu_mask(size_t size, cpumask_t cpus)
- Make that function use your newly added
	percpu_data_populate(struct percpu_data *p, int cpu, size_t size, gfp_t gfp);
	(maybe put `size' into 'struct percpu_data'?)
- implement __alloc_percpu() as __alloc_percpu_mask(size, cpu_possible_map)
- hack around madly until it compiles on uniprocessor.
