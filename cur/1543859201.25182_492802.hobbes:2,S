I'm talking about fixing just the race Andrew noticed via inspection. No
it doesn't appear to fix Andrei's problem, unfortunately. But it needs
to be fixed all the same, doesn't it?

Now I'm not exactly sure how ext3 (or any other) filesystems make use
of this particular feature of try_to_free_buffers(), but it is clear
from the comments what it is for. So your patch isn't really a minimal
fix (ie. it would require an OK from all filesystems, wouldn't it?)
Or did I miss a mail where you reasoned that it is safe to make this
change (/me goes to reread the thread)...
