this year?
New drivers/filesystems should get treatment such as:
1.  build cleanly, no compile/link warnings
2.  check with sparse, eliminate its warnings
3.  use 'make checkstack buildcheck namespacecheck'
    and fix their problems
similar to what I recently did on the Areca/arcmsr driver
and on libata-acpi additions.
