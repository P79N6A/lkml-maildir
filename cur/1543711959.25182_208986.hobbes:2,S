Hello,
I am using Kernel 2.6.4 and the newest hotplug software from
ftp.kernel.org. When I hotplug a usb mass storage device, I get a
message like "disk at
/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/usb1/1-2/1-2:1.0/host1/1:0:0:0" on
tty1.
Where does this message come from and how can I prevent it from
appearing? Of course I do not want such a message because it corrupts
the text for example in the vi editor.
Regards
  Christoph
