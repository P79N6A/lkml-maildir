I'd hope that we can fix the small helper functions to not need BKL -
there are already many circumstances where you can't use the BKL anyway
(ie you already hold a spinlock - I'd really like to have the rule that
the BKL is the "outermost" of all spinlocks, as we could in theory some
day use it as a point to schedule away on BKL contention).

Sure. As long as there is some sane naming and not too many new non-static
functions. Maybe just "fs/mount.c" for the vfsmount caches etc.
