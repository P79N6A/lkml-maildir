Not at all.
We're pursuing two courses of action right now, that are not mutually
exclusive.
Jon Smirl's argument is that we can satisfy both needs simultaneously
with a GL only strategy, and that doing two is counter productive,
primarily on available resource grounds.
My point is that I don't think the case has (yet) been made to put all
eggs into that one basket, and that some of the arguments presented for
that course of action don't hold together.
