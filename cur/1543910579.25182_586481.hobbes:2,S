As long as the reserve is large enough to completely initialize writeout
of a single page we can make progress. Once writeout is initialized the
completion interrupt is guaranteed to happen (assuming working
hardware).
This makes that I can happily run a 256M anonymous workload on a machine
with only 128M memory.

Yes it is, disk based completion does not require memory, network based
completion requires unbounded memory.

For disk based writeback you do not know when it comes, but you need
only passively wait for it. 
For networked writeback you need to receive all packets that happen to
be targeted at your machine and inspect them - and toss some away
because you cannot keep everything, memory is limited.

throttle_vm_writeout() does sort-of.

Yes, Daniel is working on writeout throttling.
