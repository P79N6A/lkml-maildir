i have an escape path for the MM-goodness issue: we can make it
O(nr_running_threads) if need to be, by registering MM users into a per-MM
'MM runqueue', and scanning this runqueue for potentially better
candidates if it's non-empty. In the process case this falls back to O(1),
in the threaded case it would be scanning the whole (local) runqueue in
essence.
And George Anzinger has a nice idea to help those platforms which have
slow bitsearch functions, we can keep a floating pointer of the highest
priority queue which can be made NULL if the last task from a priority
level was used up or can be increased if a higher priority task is added,
this pointer will be correct in most of the time, and we can fall back to
the bitsearch if it's NULL.
so while i think that the O(1) design indeed stretches things a bit and
reduces our moving space, it's i think worth a try. Switching an existing
per-CPU queue design for a full-search design shouldnt be too hard. The
load-balancing parts wont be lost whichever path we chose later on, and
that is the most important bit i think.

i've disabled the 'run child first' behavior in the latest patch at:
        
http://redhat.com/~mingo/O
(1)-scheduler/sched-O1-2.5.2-B1.patch
the crash bug i've been hunting all day, but i cannot reproduce it which
appears to show it's either something really subtle or something really
stupid. But the patch certainly does not have any of the scarier
strace/ptrace related bug scenarios or 'two CPUs run the same task' bugs,
i've put lots of testing into that part. The only crash remaining in -B1
is a clear NULL pointer dereference in wakeup(), which is a direct bug not
some side-effect, i hope to be able to find it soon.
right now there are a number of very helpful people who are experiencing
those crashes and are ready to run bzImages i compile for them (so that
compiler and build environment is out of the picture) - Pawel Kot for
example. (thanks Pawel!)

i've disabled it to reduce the number of variables - we can still try and
enable it later on once things have proven to be stable.
