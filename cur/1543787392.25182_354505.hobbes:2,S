Similar on ia64, but I don't see the problem across the network (either to
or from my 2.6.14-rc2 system).  But I do see an odd time for localhost!
$ ping localhost
PING linux-t10 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from linux-t10 (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=4294967 ms
64 bytes from linux-t10 (127.0.0.1): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=4294967 ms
