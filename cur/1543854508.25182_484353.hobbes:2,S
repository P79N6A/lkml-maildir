Simplest would be to manipulate a bitmask:
  gpio_request() --> return test_and_set_bit(...) ? -EBUSY : 0;
  gpio_free() --> clear_bit(...)
Or if you want to track the identifiers and provide a debugfs dump
of the active GPIOs and their status, use an array of strings (and
spinlock its updates) or nuls as "fat bits", instead of a bit array.

What they're supposed to do is report conflicts between two
drivers which both think they own the GPIO ... as errors.
That's different from pin mux setup, which for most embedded
systems is just making sure the SOC is configured to match
what Linux expects.  The boot loader usualy does some of that,
but it's probably not validated to do more than reliably boot
an operating system ... so pin muxing can't realistically
report anything as an error.  At best, it's a suggestion to
update the bootloader someday.

No, but letting the second one report the fatal error is a big help.
And heck, you've got reasonable chance the first driver will work,
if the second doesn't interfere with it!  (Or maybe it's the other
way around.  At least you'd have logged a fatal error message ...)

I thought you were someone who _wanted_ this mechanism?
Or were you instead thinking of a pin mux mechanism?
There can be no arch-neutral pin muxing that takes just
a GPIO number as input (which is how gpio_request works).
The reason is that there are platforms which need muxing,
and which have multiple options as to which pin a given
GPIO goes out on (and contrariwise, which GPIO is coupled
to a given pin).

Enabling the pin as a GPIO is a pin mux responsibility, not
a "keep drivers from stepping all over each other" thing.
Admittedly, the GPIO controller in those Atmel chips (AVR32,
AT91) does have a one-to-one mapping for muxable pins and GPIOs,
but that's not a portable notion.

Don't use BUG_ON in new code ... in this case it'd be best to just
warn and return.  Notice by the way that this isn't an inverse of
the gpio_request(), since you aren't taking the pin back from the
GPIO controller.

Someone had the suggestion to reduce the number of #defines
by doing someting like
  #define GPIO_PIN_PA(N) (GPIO_PIOA_BASE + (N))
  #define GPIO_PIN_PB(N) (GPIO_PIOB_BASE + (N))
  #define GPIO_PIN_PC(N) (GPIO_PIOC_BASE + (N))
  #define GPIO_PIN_PD(N) (GPIO_PIOD_BASE + (N))
I kind of like that, even if it's not such a direct match to
Atmel's documentation.

Aren't you going to want to add AVR-specific extensions so that
drivers (or more typically, board init code) can manage pullups
and input de-glitching?
