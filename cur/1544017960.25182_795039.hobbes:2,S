Exactly.

It is not even necessary to disable the drivers; it would be sufficient
to not force-load the video1394 module.  (Or to fix the udev rule.)
Presence of a Firewire card does not cause video1394 to be auto-loaded;
only certain types of FireWire cameras cause respective uevents and thus
autoloading of the special-purpose driver video1394.  Ergo, Ionut's
userland has a configuration somewhere which loads video1394 explicitly.
