There were some changes in the bdflush code in 2.2.8, but some of those
were withdrawn in 2.2.9.  However the kupdate daemon was not introduced
until *2.2.11*; it's still in present kernels.  I remember losing about
5 hours worth of data sometime in that range of kernels, and I had
/sbin/update disabled because I thought it wasn't necessary.  Evidently
it was.  I'm under the impression it is not required for current 2.3
kernels.

gcc  -> original GNU compiler project
pgcc -> spin-off concentrating on better Pentium code at expense of reliability
egcs -> spin-off concentrating on better social engineering of engineers
        the better parts of pgcc are absorbed into egcs, and lots of
	work is done in general
gcc  -> absorbs egcs project, i.e. egcs becomes new official gcc project
        absorption process not quite permeated whole world yet
