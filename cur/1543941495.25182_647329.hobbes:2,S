i've applied this series too. It's pretty straightforward changes, 
mostly at the right granularity level.
a few style nits though (i fixed them up, so no need to resend):
> +static inline int ptep_set_access_flags(struct vm_area_struct *vma,

we put a newline between variable definitions and the first code 
statement. That makes it a tiny bit easier to see the structure of the 
code.
