I guess I am misunderstanding something, or surely someone else would
come
up with this a long time ago:
UP can be changed to reschedule whenever no spinlocks are held, because
there 
is a global count of locks held that can be checked cheaply.
SMP don't have such a count, as the count would pingpong from cache to
cache.
But do we need a total count?  Seems to me each processor may have a
count how
many locks it holds - independent of other processors. And if *this*
processor
don't hold any locks then it ought to be able to reschedule even if
another processor hold some lock?  The new process shceduled may try to
get that lock
and block, but the current process may do that too.
