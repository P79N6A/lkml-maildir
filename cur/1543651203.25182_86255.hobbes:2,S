So what makes the home agent so much more important than, say, named,
pppd, gated, portmap, inetd, sendmail, sshd, etc. ?
A much more common admin mistake would be to reboot the wrong box, or
to disconnect the wrong cable, and you're powerless against this too.
If all else fails, add this to ~root/.bashrc:
alias kill='echo "Sorry, you'\''re too dumb for this"; false'
