Here is your problem:

This is the infamous APIC bug.  I have about ten reports of this over a
four-month period.  Mark Hemment mentioned it just yesterday.
This is not a 3c59x problem.  It is due to the APIC forgetting how to
generate interrupts for a particular IRQ.  It happens mostly for NICs
because they generate a lot of interrupts.  I've had it happen just
once.  In that case, _nothing_ would make the interrupt come back
(including a driver unload/reload).
This gets reported a lot by 3c59x users because this driver specifically
detects and reports on the problem. 
Donald Becker says that this is a software bug (I don't know why he
thinks this).  He says that he _always_ boots linux with the `noapic'
option to prevent it happening.

Interesting.   So you had a stable 2.2.14 machine which suddenly started
repeatedly exhibiting this problem?  Is it still reproducible?
