That's news to me.
I do recall some months ago that there were a whole bunch of patches doing
a whole bunch of stuff and I was concerned that there was an absence of a
central coordinating role.  But then everything went quiet.
If you have time/inclination to marshall the hugetlb efforts then for
heavens sake, send in a MAINTAINERS record and let's roll the sleeves up.

aaargh.  A pox upon the people who did that.  Well if they find their
upstream later breaks things then tough luck.
Look.  All interested parties should subscribe to linux-mm
(majordomo@kvack.org).  Let's get all the patches on the table there and
work through them, asap.  We know how do this.
