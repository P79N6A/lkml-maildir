Hi everyone,
We have seen on the 2.4.14-loop problem that a lot of people don't read the 
LKML or the archives. 
But there is still the broken 2.4.15 on kernel.org. 
Now I am asking myself wouldn't  it be better to mark 2.4.15 as broken and 
replace it as soon as Alexander and Andrea have decided which of the patches 
is better?
greetings
Christian Bornträger
