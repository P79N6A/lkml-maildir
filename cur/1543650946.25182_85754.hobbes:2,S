I'd be amazed of current CPUs would be able to do asymmetric encryption at
anywhere within an order of magnitude of those rates.
Symmetric encryption is something else. This is the reason many encryption
products (ie, pgp) only use asymmetric encryption for encrypting a symmetric
session key, and not encrypting the entire message.
