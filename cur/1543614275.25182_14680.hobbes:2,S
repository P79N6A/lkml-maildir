Running kernel 2.5.2-pre1 compiled with gcc 3.0.3,
i get the following error irregularly when starting
X or trying to compile sawfish in an xterm:
Inconsistency detected by ld.so: dynamic-link.h: 62: elf_get_dynamic_info: Assertion `! "bad dynamic tag"' failed!
Have no idea what it means, and it doesn't happen
under any earlier 2.5.X kernels using the same
compiler.
Am also using binutils-2.11.2 and glibc-2.2.4.
