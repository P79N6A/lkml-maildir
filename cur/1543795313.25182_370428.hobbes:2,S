Hello,
Until a few minutes ago I assumed that modules that have been inserted
automatically or by "modprobe -k" into the kernel are being removed by
calling "rmmod -a" twice if these modules are unused. But I just
realized that this works neither with kernel 2.4.30 nor with kernel
2.6.11.12.
So, what is the matter with autoclean of modules?
Regards
  Christoph
