I think
  - Paul's suggestion sounds attractive. But I can't see fundamental differences
    from user's side between "implemented as subsys" and "implemetned as cgroup's
    feature". I feel it's easier for user's cgroup library to handle subsys rather
    than "we can mount it anywhere, multiple times!".
    Flexiblity doesn't means it's easy to use.
  - About signal, there is a problem.
    * cgroup's attach() is per thread.
    * signal is per process.
    To fix this gap, signal subsystem should be implemented as it is with some
    *policy*. This doesn't match simple grouping by NOOP.
  - And, I personally thinks that signal subsystem has to implement following
    controls. (if we implement it.)
    Assume that 
      - we send SIGHUP to all process under /cgroup/group_A/ to restart.
      - we send SIGABRT to tale coredump.
    At doing this kind of things, the user should know the order target and has
    specify order in many cases.
    For example) 
     send signal to one by one  ProcessA -> ProcessB -> ProceessC 
                                or
                                ProcessC -> ProcessB -> ProcessA
     or
       send all at once.
     Which is better is case-by-case.
     (In this area, "freezing" subsystem is also have problems.)
