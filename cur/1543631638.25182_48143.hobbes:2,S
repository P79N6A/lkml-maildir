Hi,
I think it might be related to the OOPS I reported .
With 2.4.19-preX where X=8  with ac or not, with aa,
what ever... my machine oop after exiting X. See the
trace log some one told me to run memtest but it is
all OK,  the culprit is in drm unlocking page
somewhere, 
 My box is i810 chipset. Now I only can use
2.4.19-pre2 :-)
If I do not use dri , oop did not happen.
Regard,
