The other two look fine. This one should remove the mb(). cpu_relax
IIRC already includes a barrier(), and we are not concerned about
consistency here, only coherency, which the hardware takes care of
for us.
The flush_cpumask is guaranteed to be cleared *after* all other
variables (eg. flush_mm) have been used... that happens in the IPI
handler of course.
Aside, if we *were* worried about consistency here, smp_mb would
have been the more correct barrier to use.
