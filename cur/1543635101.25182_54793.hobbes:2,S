Shouting and exclamation marks - a bad sign.
You are mistaken. This has never been a feature.
It is not in 2.4.18, and it looks like it will not be in 2.4.19.
It is in some vendor kernels, but it is ugly and causes various problems.
If somebody cares about having statistics she should submit a patch
adding /proc/diskstat.
