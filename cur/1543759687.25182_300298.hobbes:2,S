No offense intended, but Rusty's trivial bot is often too slow
for critical patches, so trivial-but-critical would be better off
going to thru the x.y tree IMO.

It will if they fix real problems that people are experiencing.
The trivil bot and/or kernel-janitors paths for patches are better
used for slow/non-critical patches, not patches that need quick
attention and merging.
