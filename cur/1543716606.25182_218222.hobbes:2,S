 I suppose the comment is incorrect, at least for the PCI bus (the two
other kinds of attachments use GPIO, so they may well be
endian-independent).  The PCI and HT I/O space accesses are done via the
non-swapping address space, so data will appear as swapped in the
big-endian configuration of the system.
 I had a brief discussion on the hack last Summer with the author of the
code, but had no time to dig more deeply into it.  Now the author is gone,
but I'll have a look at it.  Don't hold your breath, though.
