Are you sure about this part?  Shifting something left by sizeof(something)
seems very strange.  It'll give different results on 64-bit machines for
the same hardware.  Are you sure it wasn't supposed to be an addition?
If this was indeed intended then can you please explain why?
If it was supposed to be an addition, wouldn't this be more clearly
expressed by defining a suitable structure and using sizeof(that structure)
to work out the address range?
