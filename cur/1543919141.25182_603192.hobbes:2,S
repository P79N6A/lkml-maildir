There's already much in the way of automation and infrastructure
present in supporting the request_firwmare() interfaces (perhaps not
the best of names) which can provide for a level of flexibility beyond
a basic 'soft_port_name' interface.
Though I don't see why both can't coexist cleanly -- I take it the use
case you are considering is: software recognizes no valid WWPN
available, query via request_firmware() fails, software halts
initialization (rather than fail), and awaits the admin to poke
'0x123456.. > /sys/.../fc_host/soft_port_name', causing a ping to the
driver and continuation of initialization with requested portname?
