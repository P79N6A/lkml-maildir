I'd been waiting for along time to get a wireless card for my Linux 
system at a reasonable price. A couple of weeks ago CompUSA had zyxel 
g102's fo 19.95 and  zyxel  base stations
for 19.95 - no rebates were involved:) So I got one of each. The pc-card 
uses an atheros chip
which is supported by MadWifi. The module includes a binary hal module 
that keeps the
card from being abused - programmed out of FCC specs. Why is so 
different from a card that
has to have firmware loaded on it that in essence does the same thing - 
prevents the driver
writer from programming the card out of FCC specs.
And Atheros stepped up to the table and provide this hal binary piece.
