count_list() appears to be the largest consumer of cpu after this is
done, or so say the profiles after running updatedb by hand on
2.5.33-mm1 on a 900MHz P-III T21 Thinkpad with 256MB of RAM.
  4608 __rdtsc_delay                            164.5714
  2627 __generic_copy_to_user                    36.4861
  2401 count_list                                42.8750
  1415 find_inode_fast                           29.4792
  1325 do_anonymous_page                          3.3801
It also looks like there's either a bit of internal fragmentation or a
missing kmem_cache_reap() somewhere:
  ext3_inode_cache:    20001KB    51317KB   38.97
      dentry_cache:     4734KB    18551KB   25.52
   radix_tree_node:     1811KB     1923KB   94.20
       buffer_head:     1132KB     1378KB   82.12
It does stay quite a bit more nicely bounded than without slablru though.
Maybe it's old news. Just thought I'd try running a test on something tiny
for once. (new kbd/mouse config options were a PITA BTW)
Cheers,
Bill
