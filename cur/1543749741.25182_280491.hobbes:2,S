Hi,
Im looking for linux equivalent of the FreeBSD calls:
1. at_fork
     typedef void
     (*forklist_fn)(struct proc *, struct proc *, int);
     int at_fork(forklist_fn func);
     The at_fork facility allows a kernel module to ensure that it is 
notified at any process fork.  The function func is called with the a 
pointer to the forking process's proc structure, a pointer to the 
child's process structure and a flag word, as used in rfork(2) to 
indicate the type of fork.
     If the requirement for notification is removed, then the function 
rm_at_fork() must be called with the exact func argument as the 
corresponding call to at_fork().
2. at_exit
     typedef void (exitlist_fn) (struct proc *);
     int at_exit(exitlist_fn func);
     The at_exit facility allows a kernel module to ensure that it is 
notified at any process exit.  The function func is called with the a 
pointer to the exiting process's proc structure.
  Specifically im on RHEL3... any pointers are appreciated...
thanks,
Arun
