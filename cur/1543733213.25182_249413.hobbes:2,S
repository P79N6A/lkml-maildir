Subject: [PATCH] __set_page_dirty_nobuffers mappings
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Marcelo noticed that the BUG_ON in __set_page_dirty_nobuffers doesn't
make much sense: it lost its way in 2.6.7, amidst so many page_mappings!
It's supposed to be checking that, although page->mapping may suddenly
go NULL from truncation, and although tmpfs swizzles page_mapping(page)
between tmpfs inode address_space and swapper_space, there's sufficient
stabilization while here in __set_page_dirty_nobuffers that the mapping
after we locked mapping->tree_lock is the same as the mapping before we
locked mapping->tree_lock i.e. the lock we hold is the right one.
