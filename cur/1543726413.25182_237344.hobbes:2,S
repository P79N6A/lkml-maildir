There are legitimate reasons to use smp_processor_id() outside of a
non-preemptible region, though.  These include debugging
printks/logging, and situations where the awareness of CPU is for
optimization rather than correctness (for example, using per-cpu data
with per-cpu locks, which are only contended if preemption occurs, or
per-cpu counters incremented with atomic operations (or where counter
accuracy is not critical)).
The detection mechanism we used in 2.4 was simply to grep for
smp_processor_id and check/fix everything manually (which is somewhat
tedious, but there aren't *too* many instances in core code, and many
uses are similar to one another).
