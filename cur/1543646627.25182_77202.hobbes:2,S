Subject: [PATCH] 2.4: get_pid() typo fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Magnificent Marcelo,
Fix a typo in the comment of getpid() - we return current->tgid these
days, not current->pid.  Additionally, add some new comments explaining
exactly why we return the tgid and how this works.
Patch is against 2.4.20-pre9, please apply.
