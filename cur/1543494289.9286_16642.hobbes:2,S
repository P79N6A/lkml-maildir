Well, this begs the question: "What is a 32bit Linux application" in
this case?  By definition, all Alpha Linux applications are 64-bit.
There is no 32-bit Linux Alpha mode for either applications or the
kernel.  (There is a 32-bit i386 EMULATOR, but it is slow, etc, etc.)
So, this must mean that you have source written to originally be used
on a 32-bit platform.  Well, if the source is not poorly-written, a
recompile ought to get it working just fine for you.

This is not allowed, on Alpha at least.  Everything is 64-bit.

Well, I'm not familiar with those functions, but AFAIK, there is no
such thing in AlphaLinux.  I believe DEC has done some fudging with
their C compile to emulate 32-bits for source.  This compiler only
runs on Digital Unix, but you can run the generated binaries on
AlphaLinux -- IFF you can get your hands on Digital Unix shared
libraries.  So, in this case, the compiler is working the dark magic.
