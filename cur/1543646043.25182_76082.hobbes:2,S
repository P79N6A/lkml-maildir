In the order you gave above, they are:
- Control
- Kanji/Hiragana (The smaller characters underneath are 'Kanji bango' [=
 "Kanji number"])
- Muhenkan [="No conversion"]  (The smaller characters underneath are
 'Bunsetsu yomi' [="Sentence fragment reading"])
- Space
- Zenkoho [="Previous candidate"] / Henkan (Jikoho) [="Conversion (Next
 candidate)"] / Zenkoho [="All candidates"]
- Hiragana (Underneath is 'Romaji', i.e. English characters)
- Zenmen ki [="Next screen key"]
- Control
Hope that helps,
Bruce
