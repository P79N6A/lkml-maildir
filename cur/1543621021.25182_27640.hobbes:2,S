I've seen a 20-way Linux software raid used to capture uncompressed HTDV 
video in realtime, as part of an HTDV video editing system for which I 
believe the client was billed six figures.
That was SCSI.  (Well, dual qlogic fiber channel controllers that pretended 
to be scsi.)  I've also encountered a couple companies selling 14-drive 
enclosures (IDE, they rackmount in a 3U or 4U) that are turned into big 
software raid systems for data hosting.
And of course, you might want to talk to IBM and their global file system 
stuff, and their implementation of the logical volume management stuff last 
year (what was not the one that Linus eventually went with, I believe...)
Does this count?
(I kind of doubt IBM, HP, or Sun are insterested in tools for individual 
end-users...)
