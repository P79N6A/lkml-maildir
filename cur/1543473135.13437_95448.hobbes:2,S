No, your first patch was much better.
Imagine two CPU's doing "disable_bh()" at the same time - neither of them
running in a BH context. In that case start_bh_atomic() will do no locking
at all, and you have the race again. 
I agree that the bitop should also be atomic, and the only way to do it
properly is probably with a spinlock. I'll think about it, but in the
meantime your first patch at least means we have some basic consistency.
