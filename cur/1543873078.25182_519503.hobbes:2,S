Well we have the 'fullmm' case, which avoids all the locked pte operations
(for those architectures where hardware pt walking requires atomicity).
However we still have to visit those to-be-unmapped parts of the page table,
to find the pages and free them. So we still at least need to bring it into
cache for the read... at which point, the store probably isn't a big burden.
