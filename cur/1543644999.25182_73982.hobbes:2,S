If your system is functional enough after the "event" that the user can make 
this selection and the system listens to them, then it can clearly be done in 
userspace.
Otherwise, the ability to select is kind of pointless.  It has to be done 
before you actually have a problem, and will result in swahili bug reports to 
the list because that's the language it was outputting when the problem 
happened and they can't necessarily reproduce the problem on demand.
