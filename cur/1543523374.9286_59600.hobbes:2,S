I think that good place to do that would be firewall chains.
You should write a kernel module witch installs firewall
hooks and count packets there.
Hope this helps.

fw_* are pointers to functions where you do your job.
static struct firewall_ops my_ops = {
	NULL,
	fw_forward,
	fw_input,
	fw_output,
	PF_INET,
	1
};
int init_module(void)
{
	if(register_firewall(PF_INET, &my_ops) < 0) {
		printk("<1>register_firewall failed\n");
		return -1;
	}
 	return 0;
}
void cleanup_module(void)
{
	unregister_firewall(PF_INET, &my_ops);
}
