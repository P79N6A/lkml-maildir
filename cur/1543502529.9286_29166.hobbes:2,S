Assuming that you have used the correct headers for compilation, you must
have omitted the "-O2" flag in your compilation. The modules must be
compiled with the same optimization flag as the kernel. If this is okay,
do a - cat /proc/ksyms | grep put_user. See the output. If you can find
the symbol __put_user_X, then, I don't know what else could be the
problem. If you do find them in the output, it means that you have set a
different level of optimization or you have a kernel compiled with version
information for modules "CONFIG_MODVERSIONS".
