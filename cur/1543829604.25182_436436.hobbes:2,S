Hmm..I wish this forcced migration will not break resource isolation sub system
in future.

But in dynamic reconfiguration case (ex. VM resiging for load balancing)
the demand is not so heavy. And if we want to remove cpu by force, just adding
one line to script, echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/cpu_removal_migration is enough.
This is not so big obstacle.

Hmm, maybe useful. I'll consider again this if I can go ahead.
