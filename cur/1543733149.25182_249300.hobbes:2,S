Because a lot of them happen to like running things on Linux, or having
the webserver still work while they are blasting aliens. You could ask a
few of them. Thats a rather good idea when you don't understand why
people do something. They also play a lot of open source games - bzflag,
cube, flightgear (which does need a high end video card to do well),
gl-117, neverball etc. Take a look at the happypenguin website some day.

There is certainly a strong Gentoo gaming contingent.

The source code ones only go for R2xx series, not R300/R400. A browse of
the documentation would have told you that. Whether this will change
nobody knows. Perhaps as R3xx ceases to be leading edge ATI will be nice
to us.
