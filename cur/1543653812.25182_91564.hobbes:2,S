This is purely a performance decision. If you want to avoid bad latency on
reads then you have to throttle writes. The loop_thread will make the
system just as slow as a user application writing the same number of
pages.
If you want io scheduling you will deliberately slow writes to let reads
happen in reasonable time. And vice-versa I imagine, although I don't
think I've seen that case.
