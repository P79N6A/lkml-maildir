Gentlemen, please remove your wanking selves back to the gutter you've
crawled from.  This is not slashdot[1].  This is not gnu.misc.discuss.
This is not alt.sex.cartooney.sue.sue.sue.  This is a technical maillist
and that dungpile doesn't belong here.  If you insist on hitting vger,
ask davem to create a new maillist (linux-kooks@... would fit that kind
of traffic nicely) and for pity sake, do fuck off already.  Enough is
enough.
