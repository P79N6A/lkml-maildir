Yes indeed, I will try next monday.

Yes, but it could take forever... :-((
As I said, I have removed the sfq and htb modules,
and I would like to wait one week to see if these
boxes will crash. I have 8 linux boxes running 2.6.25
with the same .config and only the two with htb/sfq
qdisc are crashing. Just few minutes ago I have seen
this message forwarded to netdev by David Miller:
Re: PROBLEM: kernel lockup while changing TC rules
it is talking about htb/sfq. Maybe it is related.
