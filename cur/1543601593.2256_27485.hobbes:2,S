How can I test it? Can someone point me to a simple program to do it? Then
I could run it over the non-optimized, the optimized in the good bios and
the optimized in the bad bios plus patch to test it.
Altough my system shows the bug, I am not sure if we should add the patch
as the default option right now. Actually, we don´t have a clue if the
only thing this bit is doing is solving the bug or if it is going to be
responsible for an unknown and unnoticed bug that will show up later. Why
rush things up? Can´t we wait a word from VIA and then decide what to
do? What could be done is to put this patch somewhere other than the list
where we can point people that come to lkml with this problem to.
