I think that the idea behind the 300 wrap is not "this is
reserved daemon area", but more like "chances are that most
daemons on the system that started up at boot time, are now
residing with PID's below 300, so if the routine that looks for a
new PID (getpid?) skips these 300, then it will have a better
chance at getting a free PID earlier rather than walking through
a bunch of PID's that are likely being used allready.
Makes sense to me anyways..
