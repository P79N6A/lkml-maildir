I'm surprised that other vendors are actually still shipping it[1].
(Not only that, some vendors have actually been sitting on smbfs
 patches for well over a year).
Given that it's clearly abandoned, moving to cifs seems to be the
only sensible thing to do, and anything that can be done to ease
that transition should be done.

[1] Especially after the recent security problem where smbfs stayed
vulnerable for a week or so after CIFS got fixed.  How many bad guys
thought "Hmm, wonder if smbfs has the same bug" in that week?
