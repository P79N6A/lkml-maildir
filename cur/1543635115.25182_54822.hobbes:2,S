That's not correct... if you set the encryption type to none the
connection and port forwarding are not encrypted, but the handshake still
is, using password, host key, or requiring both. You can make a fully
authenticated non-encrypted connection. I like running the popular "sleep"
program as the main command, and using port forwarding for what you do,
since you reject running ppp over ssh.
I'm running 19-pre10ac2+smp patches, as I recall ac4 or 5 are out, I just
stopped upgrading when I got stability. If you run uni you should be able
to drop in the new kernel, push the excryption overhead to the endpoints,
and have nearly no work on the star server.
