Hello!
I want to announce our new version of swsusp-v4. I feel like it's stable
enough to notify people interested about this feature. I'd like to hear
success stories (:-)), ideas.. or anything you want to say.
Please go to: 
http://falcon.sch.bme.hu/~seasons/linux
You will find there a small description, Changelog and of course the patch
itself.
The only thing that needs to be changed.. there is a
spin_unlock(pagedir_lock);... that should be suspend_lock.. (however it
did compile for me..)
Awaiting your feedback.
		Seasons
