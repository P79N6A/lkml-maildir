And what is that supposed to be????
I have a piece of pretty well designed hardware here... and my
application requires me to have the PCI board to random access
in master mode a whole lot of memory (anywhere from 128MEGS to
1GIG... and possibly more...) so I really do need BIG DMA buffers
(I don't say huge anymore as one can get 1/2 Gig of RAM for just
over 120 bucks???)... 
There is no way I can have the piece of hardware behave in 
another fashion... and NO it is NOT broken (when you do BOTH 
hardware & software, you know about BOTH limitations... there
are just some cases where you have to face some unique issues).
the mem=1024M works pretty fine once you have figured out how 
to handle in a fairly simple way this "reserved" memory...
So please software people... do not blame it all on the 
hardware... =)
Chris.
