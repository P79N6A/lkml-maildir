This is not my editor; it is either a manual screwup or cut and paste
(inside vi(1) and/or ed(1) buffers) of code which did so beforehand.
Thanks for cleaning that up for me; it's one of my own largest pet
peeves and I'm not terribly pleased to hear I've committed it (though
I'll not go so far as to shoot the messenger).

i386 only, CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G with various combinations of highpte &
highpmd, and nohighmem. No CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G or non-i386 machines that
can run 2.5.x are within my grasp (obviously CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G machines
could, I just don't have them, and the discontig code barfs on mem=).
