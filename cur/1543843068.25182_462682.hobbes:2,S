yeah, i too suspect that it's timing related.

but in case it's not timing related, could you do some more testing, 
ontop of the 77ba89c5cf28d5d98a3cae17f67a3e42b102cc25 tree?
The b29739f902ee76a05493fb7d2303490fc75364f4 patch is quite large, so i 
have created a finegrained, functional splitup of it:
  sched-cleanups.patch
  sched-add-task-rq-lock-ops.patch
  sched-add-rt-mutex-setprio.patch
  sched-pi-lock.patch
  sched-add-new-macros.patch
  sched-add-normal-prio.patch
  sched-use-has-rt-policy.patch
  sched-set-user-nice-fix.patch
  sched-use-normal-prio.patch
and have attached the resulting tarball. (Just extract the tarball into 
the known-good 77ba89c5cf28d5d98a3cae17f67a3e42b102cc25 tree, it will 
create a patches/ directory which includes a series file and the 
patches. If you install quilt then you can do 'quilt push' / 'quilt pop' 
to navigate in the patch-queue easily. Use 'quilt applied' to see the 
current patch-stack.)
i have ordered the patches within the splitup in a way so that the 
patches with more impact are at the end. The last patch 
(sched-use-normal-prio) is the one most likely to cause the problem (but 
sched-set-user-nice-fix and sched-use-has-rt-policy are possible 
candidates too). I have verified that every intermediate step builds and 
boots cleanly as well.
Could you try this patch-queue and figure which patch causes the failure 
you are seeing? That would reduce the search space quite significantly.
