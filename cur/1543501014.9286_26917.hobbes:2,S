   2.3.9-pre7 can rather badly damage filesystems, because block_dev.c
   does buffer-cache access without the kernel lock held.
   i suspect that this patch will clash with David's cool buffer-cache
   patches - but i've just trashed one of my filesystems so i suppose
   people want to apply it ... Maybe we want to add the -DANGEROUS
   flag again? :)
Whoops :-)  In fact my buffer cache changes should make this patch
unnecessary.
Later,
