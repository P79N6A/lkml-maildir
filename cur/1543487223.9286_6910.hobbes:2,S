In cases like this, *if* there is a solution, it usually involves keeping  
some columbus-egg-type invariants - obvious once you know them, far from  
obvious before.
I suspect a real solution to the directory hardlink problem is going to  
involve some sort of ordering along (new) attributes.
There are essentially two problems I see: aliasing (which is solved by  
referring inodes) and keeping link/unlink sane. (Rename is allowed if the  
link/unlink or even unlink/link/unlink (in case of name collision)  
sequence would be allowed.)
Keeping link/unlink sane necessitates not splitting off parts of the FS.  
For the sake of applications like find, it would also be nice to avoid  
creating loops.
Now, if you're splitting off a part of the FS via link/unlink, that means  
you are creating a loop, so if you can avoid loops, not splitting off  
parts comes free.
Here's a first attempt at a rule to avoid loops. It's not optimal, because  
it's not particularly cheap, but maybe it gives someone an idea.
The root of the filesystem gets an attribute X with some numeric value[-].
Every directory gets an attribute X that is at least[+] one more than the  
highest value of any parent it has.
When you create a new link to a directory D, that means the directory gets  
a new parent P (which actually may already be a parent under another  
name). If X(P)<X(D), you're fine.
If X(P)>=X(D), you may be creating a loop. Calculate the new value for  
X(D). Recursively propagate through all children of D [*]. During this, if  
you hit D, you have a loop; don't allow the link.
As for unlink, if the link to remove points to a directory with more than  
one directory hardlink (that is, not counting any "." and ".." links you  
might want to simulate for Unix compatibility), then you can do the  
unlink. Nothing bad can happen.
[*] This is the costly part.
[+] It doesn't need to be exactly one larger. Anything larger works.
[-] Exact value unimportant.
As I said, it's not cheap, so we want something better. However, I do  
believe it's correct.
Hmm. We could work in the opposite direction, giving leaf directories one  
value and assigning values from there toward the root. Would essentially  
work the same way, except going through the parents, not the children; has  
the same type of problem, but one assumes one would have less parents than  
children on average.
The important idea is keeping X(parent) > X(child) (or X(parent) <  
X(child)) at all times.
Simple algorithm for count updating:
todo = directory about to change it's X attribute
While not empty(todo)
   pull candidate from list
   see if candidate needs X attribute changed
     if yes, add all children (or parents) of candidate to list
     if one of those was the original directory, fail the operation
When the list is empty, you're done. Since you started out without a loop,  
the new loop must involve your starting directory, so either you'll find  
the loop or terminate after looking at a finite number of directories.
Hmm. I just noticed this is very similar to the problem of threading news  
articles. I just argued pretty strongly in the "drums" mail standards list  
that we should not allow the more-than-one-parent case ;-)
