Take the value of dev->base_addr, mask it's lowest 4 bits, do a scan of all
PCI net devices and in each PCI device try to match to each of the 6 address
regs:
struct pci_dev* find_pci_device_by_baseddr(unsigned long base_addr)
{
      struct pci_dev *pcid = NULL;
      unsigned long reg;
      int i;
      base_addr &= ~(0x0000000F);
      while ((pcid = pci_find_class(PCI_CLASS_NETWORK_ETHERNET << 8, pcid)))
{
            for (i=0; i<6; i++) {
                  reg = pci_resource_start(pcid,i);
                  reg &= ~(0x0000000F);
                  if (reg == base_addr) {
                        return pcid;
                  }
            }
      }
      return NULL;
}

Subject: find struct pci_dev from struct net_device
Hi,
What's the easiest way to find a corresponding struct pci_dev from a
struct net_device ?  Especially, if the driver does not set
pci_dev.driver_data to it's net_device struct (such as the acenic
driver) ?
thanks,
_sh_
