Which is *fortunately* a moving target, because what served well 20 years
ago is unlikely to serve equally well *now*.
Having a stable naming of devices is a good goal, but in no way restricted
to SCSI-like devices. What you suggest works only there, what Linux currently
uses (udev etc.) works for all devices. Guess which is better for most users.

Fine, so feel free consider Linux <2.6 and Linux 2.6 two completely
separate operating systems. I did the same with the IP stack interface
in the BIRD project and I consider it a very good step -- the old
interface provided by Linux 2.0 and cluttered with BSD compatibility is
almost unusable when compared to Netlink, but for sake of users who
don't want to upgrade their kernel, BIRD is able to use the old one,
though with limited functionality.

OK. So welcome to year 2006. And to Linux 2.6.
				Have a nice fortnight
