Hi,
    May I ask you some questions?  For 885 driver in cx23885-video.c,
in function buffer_queue(), what is the difference between q->queued
and q->active?
    Also, you check if q->queued is NOT empty, then add to list.  But
why do you add q->active to list when it's empty?
    I'm learning how DMA and Risc works in cx23885 linux driver.  Your
help is appreciated.
Thanks.
