I don't know about K9N Neo, but I have MSI K9N Ultra-2F (the same
MCP55) and have no such issues. But:
- I'm not using drivers/ide anymore (I was using 2.6.17.11 with
  Alan's libata-PATA patch and now I have ca. 2.6.18-rc6 merged
  with Jeff's pata-drivers git branch)
- I have only PATA CD-ROM (and SATA disk, Seagate ST3250823AS).
- just 1 GB of RAM.
Copied CD/DVD-ROM discs to HDD few times, no problems.
