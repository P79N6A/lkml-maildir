Slightly tangential, but I'm starting to hear requests to have the OS
re-assign resources when it might make better sense.  For example, if
you have a graphics card with a 1GB memory allocation, the BIOS may
assign it into address ranges below 4GB because it doesn't know
if the OS will be 32-bit or 64-bit capable.  But, it would be
beneficial to have it located above 4GB, and to fill in the (new) hole
below 4GB with RAM.  Linux right now doesn't have a way to do this.
It will assign resources for cards that the BIOS left unassigned, but
won't intentionally move resources.
