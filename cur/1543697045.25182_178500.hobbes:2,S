Well, this is a good point to explain that some people choose their favourite
distro based on completely other criteria one might expect. I choose mine
because it was a european company and I found it acceptable to make a
"political decision" rather than a pure technical one. In a market that is as
imbalanced as IT towards US companies it sounded like the right thing to do for
me.
Unfortunately US companies have this special capability of reducing your choice
as a customer right down to (almost) zero - which is of course their simple
right in a free market environment.
And this is about the point where the debian project enters my picture ...

Which is about my argument placed on a higher level of user experience ;-)
