It looks a lot like OSDL includes an old obsolete version of perfctr.
The PM code you're getting errors in is for kernels older than 2.5.68.
The current release of perfctr knows that current 2.5 kernels use the
driver model for local APIC and NMI watchdog power management.
Unfortunately, the -osdl kernel announcements don't state _which_ release
of perfctr they're including. I was assuming they got new releases off
the download site on a regular basis, but perhaps they don't.
