Some test results were posted at

Some results for the RSS controller can be found in the OLS paper
https://ols2006.108.redhat.com/2007/Reprints/singh-Reprint.pdf
and at

As far as test cases are concerned, I have a simple test case that I use
that allocates memory and touches all the allocated memory in a loop. I
can post that out if required. It uses various types of allocation
1. mmaped memory
2. anonymous memory
3. shared memory
I also run various benchmarks inside a control group, limited to 400 MB
of RAM.
One interesting that I noticed was that when I booted with mem=<some
memory> and created a container with the same <some value>. The swapout
test case ran much faster in the container (NOTE: This was prior to the
swap cache changes).
KAMEZAWA-San posted some test results on background reclaim and per zone
reclaim
http://forum.openvz.org/index.php?t=tree&th=4696&mid=23964&&rev=&reveal=
The simplest use cases that come to mind are
1. Memory control for containers/virtualization
2. Job Isolation
