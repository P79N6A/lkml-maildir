To set the record straight: Maciej W. Rozycki did the real work, I just
merged his patch to 2.4.9-ac (and kept pestering AC until it went in :).
To ppc developers: modutils 2.4.8 added ftr_fixup support to modules,
the ftr fixup data is loaded in the archdata area.  With Maciej's patch
now in the -ac tree, it is easier to handle module archdata tables.
PPC needs code to handle ftr_fixup in modules, as well as the kernel.
See include/asm-mips/module.h::mips_module_init() for a clean example
of extracting archdata from a module, mips_init_modules() does the same
for the kernel.  arch/mips/kernel/traps.c runs the archdata for both
modules and kernel.
