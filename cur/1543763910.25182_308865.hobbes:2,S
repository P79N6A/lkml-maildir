	Using these same instructions on Debian Unstable, with my 
Thinkpad T42P (2373Q1U), this doesn't work at all. I only get 
scrolling up/down and left/middle/right click, no horizontal 
scrolling, and none of the other buttons seem to do much of anything. 
	I suspect the TP handles these events differently.
