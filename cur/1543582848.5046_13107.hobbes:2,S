Hi friends,
I am new to this field of writing device drivers. I
have done my course in Unix/C and presently working
for a company in india in embedded systems. I am
looking forward to write some device drivers in
Linux/Unix/QNX can any one suggest me any good book
which i can refer for my guidance.
thx for your constant support.
bye
rahul
