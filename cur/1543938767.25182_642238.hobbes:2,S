Byt the way what are the plans for powerpc?
We have:
arch/ppc
arch/ppc64
arch/powerpc
It was my understanding that arch/powerpc was supposed
to be the future unified powerpc architecture but it
does not even provide a defconfig.
And I do not see too much happening to do so - but that maybe
because I looked at a wrong place.
