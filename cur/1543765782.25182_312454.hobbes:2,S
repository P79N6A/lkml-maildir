Subject: [2.6 PATCH] include/linux/jiffies.h cputime miscalculation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

static inline clock_t jiffies_to_clock_t(long x)
uses a signed long as input (jiffies) while the return value of
static inline unsigned long clock_t_to_jiffies(unsigned long x)
is an unsigned long.
As long as x is <= 0x7FFFFFFF everything is fine in jiffies_to_clock_t()
but when x is >= 0x80000000 the return value of the function is
miscalculated.
I've noticed this while watching the stats of long running processes
(/proc/<PID>/stat) on i386 machines. Up to ~35785 minutes of consumed
CPU-time for a process it's ok but only one minute later there's a huge
jump in the reported CPU-time to ~319786 minutes.
With the Patch you can get straight up to ~71571 minutes of CPU time
until
you'll restart at 0 (jiffies 32bit wrap around from (2**32)-1 to 0)
For non-i386 you may get other periods of time until the overflow
happens.
