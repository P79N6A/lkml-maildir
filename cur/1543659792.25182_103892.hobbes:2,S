The transition would be rather painless:
	if (mod->new_exit) {
		res = -EBUSY;
		if (force || !mod_use_count(mod))
			res = mod->new_exit();
	} else {
		res = mod_try_exit();
		if (!res && mod->old_exit) {
			mod->old_exit();
	}
Yes, there is a small race, but at least it's nonfatal, as the module
has to repeat the module count test or is protected otherwise.
Now we can start fixing interfaces and exit functions can still call
mod_try_exit() before calling old style interfaces.

Hmm, looks as simple if not simpler to me.

If the exit function starts the shutdown, there is no going back
anymore. Let's take loop.c as example. It can either deconfigure the
devices itself (via loop_clr_fd()) or it let's the user do it and only
removes unused devices and prevents any new loop_set_fd() to succeed. In
any case there will be no deadlock.

int unregister(foo)
{
	lock();
	list_del_init(&foo->list);
	unlock();
	return foo->usecount ? -EBUSY : 0;
}
This makes sure no new user will start using it and at some point it has
to return zero.

The current scheme is the reserve/activate scheme in disguise and it
sucks as much.

Well, I'd be happy to see an implementation that not only works for the
most simplest cases.
