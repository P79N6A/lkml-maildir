This is not of primary interest. Security first.
The only way to recover those files secure without risking a crash
is maybe to let fsck rename those long files after the patch.
Before the 255-limit-patch a rename(2) may work, but without a directory
lookup from userland; quite hard to do.
When I played with Marc's case, I needed to reboot 2 times because I
tried to use tab-expansion on bash to get the filename; which caused
a machine freeze.
perl -e 'rmdir "x" x 768' worked,
or under bash
rmdir <ESC>768x  should work, too.
Really, the 255-limit is essential as long as "struct dirent/64" has
d_name[255] hard coded. Somebody should send Drepper a patch;
I did not understand why he accepted a NAME_MAX of 4032 patch for
reiserfs while knowing the hardcoded dirent limit.
