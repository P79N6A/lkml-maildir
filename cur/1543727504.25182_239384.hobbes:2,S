    Joerg, don't take it bad, nor as a personal offense, but it is
*really* difficult to follow a thread which is broken, and your
messages starts new threads. That's difficult.

    POSIX may specify 'mailx' as the name of the official mail
reader, I really don't know, but your 'mailx' is screwing the
threads.
    Believe it or not, people don't hate you and don't do things just
to annoy you, is just a bit of netiquette, no more, no less. You're a
very clever guy (the cdrecord I use everyday is there to prove it)
but sometimes you sound a bit... blunt and that causes problems.
    No offense intended ;)
