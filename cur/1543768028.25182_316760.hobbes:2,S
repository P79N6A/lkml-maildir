Aw c'mon. Don't we believe in the C programming philosphy of trusting
the programmer? You know, give them enough rope to hang themselves?
Personally, I don't care because I can parse cpuid and the like directly
myself, but examples of legitimate uses for this knowledge are
compilers, jvms, and threading libraries, all which although lowlevel,
are technically userland. I don't think it's our job to protect the user
from themselves, it's to give them a reasonable default, and the
interfaces to take advantage of the tricker stuff for special purposes
if they wish.
