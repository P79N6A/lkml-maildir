Yeah, pretty much.  But we've bumped things up to the wazzoo before
only to discover that our usage crept up there (file-max of 300,000
being a case on one machine recently.  Appears you can hit that
pretty easily when you change from smaller machines to 32Gb memory
That's why the first time we hit file-max, we added a check into
our monitoring system so we get warned before we hit it.  Any
fixed limit, I'd want one of these.  Makes me sleep much better
(literally, the bloody things SMS me if checks start failing)

True.  After they spend a day and a half figuring out what's causing
them out-of-files errors.  They swear a lot and do the wazzoo thing.

Would probably still make me sad, since these are 32 bit machines.  Given
that 150 or so seems to be the steady state on the mxes, I wouldn't want
to know what it gets up to under a spam run.  Probably close to 1000, since
that's what we limit smtpds at.
[brong@mx1 ~]$ ps ax | grep smtpd | wc -l
122
[brong@mx1 ~]$ cat /proc/sys/fs/epoll/limits 
0	159	107	1451	4096	266555
Yeah, near enough.  159 is the interesting value here (old version of limits
file, the fields are in a different order)

No, until their usage pattern changes and they become one of the middle bunch.

I'd be happy with a default of unlimited (my patch 2 plus a couple of zero
defaults would do it)
Bron ( and to think I was going to suggest a patch that would check the value
       you wrote to max_user_* to ensure it wasn't less than the current
       highest user so you didn't accidentally munt your box ;) )
