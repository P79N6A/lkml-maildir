I considered that for a while, but decided against it because:
* cpu-has-feature(cpu-feature-foo) v cpu-has-feature(foo): I picked the
latter for readability.
* Renaming CPU_FTR_<x> -> CPU_<x> makes it less obvious that
it's actually a cpu feature it's describing (i.e. CPU_ALTIVEC vs
CPU_FTR_ALTIVEC).
* Renaming would clobber the namespace, CPU_* definitions are used in
other places in the tree.
* Can't make it an inline and still use the preprocessor concatenation.
That being said, you do have a point about grepability. However,
personally I'd be more likely to look for CPU_HAS_FEATURE than the
feature itself when reading the code, and would find that easily. The
other way around (finding all uses of a feature) is harder, but the
concatenation macro is right below the bit definitions and easy to spot.
