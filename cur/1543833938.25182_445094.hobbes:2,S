Yes. It never takes a lock on any higher inode without holding the lock on a
lower inode first. I have a full proof across the VFS+FS [see below].

I had to disable the kernel's locking of multiple objects in namei.c using a
new FS_ flag because it would actually deadlock for this filesystem.

Custom filesystem (kb0), not in any tree but mine. I am in progress
with syncing it up
to the latest kernel.
If anybody really wants it, it is 70-odd K of bzip2-compressed code of
filesystem + utilities. It's not ready for non-acedemic use though.
