Sorry, Christoph, I must be particularly obtuse today.
If you don't hold a reference, then yes, the module can go away.  This
hasn't been a huge problem for users in the past.
The lack of users is because, firstly, dynamic dependencies are less
common than static ones, and secondly because the remaining inter-module
users (AGP and mtd) have not been converted.  Patches have been sent
several times, but maintainers are distracted, it seems.  I *will* run
out of patience and push those patches which take away intermodule.c one
day (hint, hint!).
For optional module dependencies, weak symbols can be used, but there
seems to be a desire for genuine dynamic dependencies.  If you can get
rid of those, I'll apply your patch in a second!
Cheers,
Rusty.
