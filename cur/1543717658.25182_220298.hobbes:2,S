No, but the pointer for another (previous) interface may just have been
set to NULL, causing an Oops when usb_ifnum_to_if loops over all
interfaces.  In other words, maybe
                for (i = 0; i < dev->actconfig->desc.bNumInterfaces; i++) {
                        struct usb_interface    *interface;
                        /* remove this interface */
                        interface = dev->actconfig->interface[i];
                        dev_dbg (&dev->dev, "unregistering interface %s\n",
                                interface->dev.bus_id);
                        device_unregister (&interface->dev);
                        dev->actconfig->interface[i] = NULL;
                }
should be turned into
                for (i = 0; i < dev->actconfig->desc.bNumInterfaces; i++) {
                        struct usb_interface    *interface;
                        /* remove this interface */
                        interface = dev->actconfig->interface[i];
                        dev_dbg (&dev->dev, "unregistering interface %s\n",
                                interface->dev.bus_id);
                        device_unregister (&interface->dev);
                }
                for (i = 0; i < dev->actconfig->desc.bNumInterfaces; i++)
                        dev->actconfig->interface[i] = NULL;
All the best,
Duncan.
