Have you ever tried to do that?
kmap() is a nop if your kernel is not compiled for CONFIG_HIGHMEM, and
kmap_atomic() doesn't even exist.
It seems we should add a vremap_boot() for the boot process.
Btw, can the MP tables cross page boundaries? kmap() would make parsing
such tables extremely difficult.
