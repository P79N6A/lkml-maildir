Thank you for all your work, its greatly appreciated. I think its time to fix 
public kernel headers so they can be included in userspace oh well I 
hear "Don't include kernel headers in userspace" flames already but some 
things are impossible without including kernel headers ( ide/v4l etc comes to 
mind ).
