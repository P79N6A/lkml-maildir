That's new. When and by whom was that rule been introduced? And with what
rationale?
Even checkpatch.pl itself says to only fix the warnings that make sense.
This one didn't. And it has so many false positives in my experiences
that a lot of its warnings are useless.
So even if you require checkpatch.pl compliance it will be always
subjective because checkpatch.pl is not always correct.
Anyways if you care so much about space<->tabs why don't you just write
a filter that converts spaces to tabs for incoming patches? Like it is
traditionally done for trailing white spaces? Would be a trivial perl script.
Bothering humans with such a silly mindless thing is beyond ridiculous.

I wish you guys would care more about actually broken logic in patches than just 
checkpatch.pl output. When I occasionally check git-x86 I always tend to find some 
obviously broken patch that should have been caught during review before
merge.
