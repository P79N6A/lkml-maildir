Actually biosless is nice.  You don't actually need to do things like enable
a20 as there isn't a BIOS to disable it...
As for working code see the linuxBIOS project.  
http://www.linuxbios.org
There aren't a lot of chipsets supported yet but progress is being made.
And you do need something like a BIOS to enable memory and cache
before you jump to the linux kernel.
Alan working on all booting x86 biosless, keeps making me chuckle over
your hatred towards BIOSes, it is absolutely amazing what linux
assumes the BIOS will setup correctly.  With linux-2.4 able to do a
complete PCI bus setup it isn't as bad it used to be, but it's still
pretty significant.
You wouldn't happen to know a good place to put drivers for superio
chips, and pci-isa bridges with the superio functions integrated?
I should have a proposal written up (and the code to implement it) in
the next month, on how to change the boot process to be more friendly
to BIOS less situations.   What we do with the ``empty_zero_page'' is
nasty, and it isn't even the empty_zero_page.
And if anyone has any questions on how the boot process works,
I'd be glad to answer specific questions.  As I've traced it fairly
thoroughly.
