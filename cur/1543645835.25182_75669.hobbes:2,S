   Do we really allow this type of layering violation?
No, it should be killed :-)
   (There appear to be some circumstances when obtaining the semaphore count is
   useful, but shouldn't we provide an architecture helper function to do that
   since a semaphore structure _is_ an architecture-defined opaque structure.)
Feel free to make one.
