The writeback code does attempt to give some preference to realtime tasks
(in get_dirty_limits()), but it can only work up to a point.
Frankly, your application is poorly designed.  If you want sub-10ms
responsiveness you shouldn't be doing disk I/O.  The realtime task should
hand the data off to a non-realtime task for writeout, with suitable
amounts of buffering in between.
