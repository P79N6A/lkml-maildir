Manfred already pointed this out, but I just wanted to clarify: my IPC
patches introduce a new API for msgctl(), semctl(), and shmctl(), along
with new msqid_ds, semid_ds, shmid_ds, shminfo, and ipc_perm structures.
The new API removes existing cruft like the way msg_cbytes was increased
in struct msqid_ds, and sensibly enlarges all variables in these
structures. This is necessary so we can fully support 32-bit UIDs. For
uniformity, this new API applies to all architectures, not just those
which are currently stuck with 16-bit UIDs.
I'd rather have the same API for SysVipc across all Linux architectures,
and keep the new code in ipc/, rather than add more architecture-specific
code.
Thanks,
Chris Wing
