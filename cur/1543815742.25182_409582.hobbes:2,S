We certainly should be pushing everyone toward using the 'xdX' etc
devices that are allocated to us. However, the installers of certain
older distros and other user space tools won't except anything other
than hdX/sdX, so its useful from a compatibility POV even if it never
goes into mainline, which I agree it probably shouldn't.
