Hey, it's not broken, it's just special :D
That works a treat, boots and otherwise seems fine.

What about just for readability: (in linux/mmzone.h)
#define SECTION_MARKED_PRESENT  (1UL<<0)
#define SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP     (1UL<<1)
#define SECTION_MAP_LAST_BIT    (1UL<<2)
#define SECTION_NID_SHIFT       SECTION_MAP_LAST_BIT
