We've decided to do a re-write of the old AIM 7 benchmark. 
The goal is to make it a more modern, kernel-focused test, while
keeping the bits we like. AIM 7 calculates a 'crossover' point using
an escalating series of loads. 
Project space is on Sourceforge: 
http://sourceforge.org/projects/re-aim-7
(couldn't think of a better name, sorry)
I'll be merging patches to start, send me suggestions and/or code. 
If someone is _really excited about this, let me know and i'll add you
as a developer. 
I can make a BitKeeper tree available also, if desired.
