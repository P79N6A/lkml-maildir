    new hardware, sometimes (keyword is sometimes not all the
time) you may need to reboot for changes in inetd configurations
to take effect.. /etc/hosts file changes, I have had to.. what
is your system doing?
    how do you run fsck? can you unmount the system drive and
run fsck on it? And not reboot? If that is the case then rather
than reboot I'd do that once a week ..

   does Suns filesystems need to be fsck'd?
