This is intended to be an architecture specific function
so if the CPU does support HW dma to the CPU's L2 cache, the
architecture specific version of memcpy_nc() would not replace
the default definition which maps memcpy_nc() to memcpy().
For CPUs like the vast majority currently available, there
is a performance benefit by not reading data into the cache
that won't be read a second time.
