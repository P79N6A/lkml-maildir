I know this was true at one time -- egcs couldn't read 2.7 spec files,
or something like that.  (I remember at the time thinking "so much for
the great and glorious '-V' theory".)
But I think it's since been fixed:
  $ gcc -v
  Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-linux/2.95.2/specs
  gcc version 2.95.2 20000220 (Debian GNU/Linux)
  $ gcc -V2.7.2.3 -v
  Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-linux/2.7.2.3/specs
  gcc driver version 2.95.2 20000220 (Debian GNU/Linux) executing gcc version 2.7.2.3
Is there more subtle breakage?
Peter
