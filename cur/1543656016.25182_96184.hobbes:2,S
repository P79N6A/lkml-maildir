Hello.
Since Rick van Rein doesn't seem to update (and answer my mails) the BadRAM patch, I've done it myself.
Attached you can find a version which applies against linux-2.4.20.
Please use this patch only if you have broken RAM and thus encounter problems with it. The utility memtest86 will give you the addresses.
For further information refer Documentation/badram.txt which will be created by the patch.
