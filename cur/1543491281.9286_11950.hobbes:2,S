How does it handle the cases where there is more used memory than space in
the swap partition? And where can I get this program?
Also, talking with a friend a few days ago, he mentioned a feature of 
another unixoid os that allowed to take a snapshot of just one program
(and dump it to a file).  This would be quite useful for a number of
things.. Is there anything similar in linux?
