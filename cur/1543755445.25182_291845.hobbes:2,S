Good catch, I'm a terrible speller.

Nope, its still used on i386 and x86-64, however I had to create an arch
independent abstraction for set/read_persistent_clock().

I believe you're right. Although we don't call read_persistent_clock()
very frequently, nor do we call it in ways we don't already call
get_cmos_time(). So I'm not sure exactly what the concern is.

I don't believe so. The full context of the code is this:
	/* First off, save suspend start time
	 * then quickly read the time source.
	 * These two calls hopefully occur quickly
	 * because the difference will accumulate as
	 * time drift on resume.
	 */
	suspend_start = read_persistent_clock();
	now = read_timesource(timesource);
Since we call read_persistent_clock(), it should return right as the
second changes, thus we will be marking the new second as closely as
possible with the timesource value. If the order was reversed, I think
it would be a concern. 
I've only lightly tested the suspend code, but on my system I didn't see
very much drift appear. Regardless, it should be better then what the
current suspend/resume code does, which doesn't keep any sub-second
resolution across suspend.
thanks so much for the code review!
