Repeating myself here...
To me it says that the scheduling policy decides at the moment of release.
What if the scheduling policy decides *right then* to give the mutex to
the next running thread that tries to aquire it?
That would be the logical way for a scheduling policy to decide the next
owner of the mutex.
