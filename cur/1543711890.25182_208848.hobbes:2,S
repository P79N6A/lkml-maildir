Wow. That cc list is growing. I'm going to trim it since those guys are
subscribed to LKML or swsusp-devel anyway.

I think it's really important that we have some eye candy. This is going
to be one of the most visible parts of the kernel, and for some people,
it's going to be the thing they stare at most of the time when they
start up/shut down. If we want to help the cause of Linux on the
desktop, we want it to look good. As long as its within reasonable
bounds, a small increase in kernel size is worth it, in my opinion.
