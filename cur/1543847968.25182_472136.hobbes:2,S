As Matthew said different Sony models use different mapping. DMI-based
keymap solution requires kernel upgrade every time new model is out
whereas configurable keymap can be loaded easily form userspace. Also
user might want to remap keys to do different stuff. For example I
never change brigtness on my laptop now that I found settings that I
like. So I could map one key to start kmail and another one to build
kernel for example ;)
