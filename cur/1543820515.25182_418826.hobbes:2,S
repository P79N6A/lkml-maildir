C++ doesn't force *any* semantic on you. It gives you tools to implement 
the semantic you want. If you want the lock to remain unlocked, that is 
of course doable.
Most often (almost always), the cause of the exception is not random 
corruption, but an error (I/O error, out of memory, etc.) and you want 
to unlock the lock. C++ helps you get it right without writing tons of 
boilerplate code:
[avi@cleopatra linux]$ grep -r out.*: . | wc -l
10446
How many times you want it unlocked but it's left locked because of an 
obscure error path? When does 2.6.16.14 come out?
