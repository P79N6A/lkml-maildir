Hi all,
OK, my experiments confirm that BLKBSZGET returns 1024 on partitions
that have not been mounted and on complete disk devices (eg. /dev/hda).
But there remain some mysteries .. :-)
My original theory was that:
	- read offset must be aligned (multiple of 512)
	- read buffer must be page_aligned (4096 on IA32)
	- count must be "aligned" (multiple of 512)
Then based on the postings on the list it became (for 2.4 kernels):
	- read offset must be BLKBSZGET aligned
	- read buffer must be BLKBSZGET aligned
	- count must be BLKBSZGET aligned
	- on an unused/unmounted partition BLKBSZGET returns 1024
	  (on an IDE disk partition), so everything must be 1024 byte aligned
But a friend of mine uses O_DIRECT with 2.4 kernels to read *individual*
single harddisk sectors of 512 bytes !  He claims that my original
theory is the right one and that you can read 512 byte chunks on 512
byte bounderies (he uses the complete device eg. /dev/hda).
So, I'm confused.  What are *exactly* the 2.4 O_DIRECT alignment
requirements ?

(yes, I should write a small test program, but my real app will be ready soon)
