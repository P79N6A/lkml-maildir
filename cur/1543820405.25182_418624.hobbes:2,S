If those processes are exposed enough that external attackers can talk
to them at all, they should be confined. And anyone who allows confined
processes to write to /etc or create or rename links in /etc at all is
an idiot.
Are we *really* defending against people who write blatantly idiotic
profiles? (What's more, unlike with SELinux, it's guaranteed to be easy
to see that that profile is idiotic, because the policy language is so
simple.)
(Obviously creating or renaming links in /** is every bit as
bad. Don't-write-stupid-profiles rule again.)
(I'm assuming a post-chroot()-absolute-paths world: in the previous
world, as exemplified by the current example profiles, /** is sane *if
and only if* the confined app is always chrooted.)
