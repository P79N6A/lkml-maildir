All,
When running any 2.4.x kernel, if gpm is running, touching the mouse ends all 
keyboard input.  Starting X without touching the mouse does the same thing.
The mouse in this case is the built-in trackpad thing common in notebooks.
2.2.x works just fine.
I don't know quite where to start on this... I've tried changing gpm 
configuration, but that doesn't seem to help.
(I'm running RedHat 7.2.)
Any ideas on where I should start looking?
TIA,
Eli  (Please CC me.)
