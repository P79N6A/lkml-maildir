There is MIME "Content-Disposition: inline".
Personally I think it's at least as good as plain text - it's MIME
attachment (you can extract automatically, you have well-defined patch
boundaries, original file name etc.) _and_ mail readers are supposed to
(and do) display such attachments as normal message parts.
The message is readable with MIME-unaware readers (scripts etc.) as well.
Such attachment (raw message data) looks like:
From: xxx@yyy
To: lkml
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="=-=-="
--=-=-=
Normal message text etc.
--=-=-=
Content-Type: text/x-patch
Content-Disposition: inline; filename=xxx.patch
--- linux-2.6/xxx.c 25 May 2003 22:13:37
+++ linux-2.6/xxx.c 25 May 2003 22:13:38
the rest of patch text

Nearly no one "must" use attachments. I can only think of people using
broken mail servers ("corporate servers").

Content-Transfer-Encoding.
I'd say "verify that it's binary-encoded - quoted-printable and base64
encodings are not permitted".
I.e., it's perfectly fine to specify "Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit"
(or "8bit" or possibly "binary", though I don't exactly know the
difference between "8bit" and "binary").

I don't think so. Badly formatted MIME attachments, sure. I'd be
surprised if Linus applies them at all.

Rather: "... someone may ask you to re-send them as properly encoded
MIME attachments".
In fact I'd encourage using binary-encoded inlined MIME attachments
at all times, with non-MIME 7bit or 8bit plain text being accepted
as secondary format.
