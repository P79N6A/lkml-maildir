Hi Alexey et al,
	I was looking at this yesterday: is there any way to get the
correct address from the skb (this is in NF_IP_POST_ROUTING), using
the dst field, or do I really need to use ip_route_output?  I can do
either, although using policy routing to control masquerading is not
very clever in netfilter, since you can just specify the NAT address
directly, but I don't really want to surprise people.
Rusty.
