That's because not provind #eof could potentially bring problems (not with 
the clever poster, though), e.g. in:
--- a/lalala
+++ b/lalala

There are actually two problems in there.
The first is that some empty context lines are missing,
the second is that they have to have a leading space, too.
The #eof I am adding is basically so that you see when a patch is really 
ending, because there is also diff's -c option which you can tune the 
number of potentially empty lines.
