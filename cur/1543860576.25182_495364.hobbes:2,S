Correctly: The resource tree is no longer corrupt for example and
pci_* resource functions actually now do the right thing. The old code
works by chance due to link order, not because anything was "broken" by
the corrections.

Not a "2.6.20 stopping problem" and trivial to fix further.

I'm very concerned about what that will break that depends upon it - eg
all the work done for suspend/resume PCI handling has not been tested
without the patch. Thus I'd rather fix it given the fix is trivial.
Want a fix Linus given Jeff is away ?
