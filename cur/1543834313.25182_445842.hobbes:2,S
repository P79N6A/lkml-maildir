The code looks clean.
- Could use setup_timer().
- Check the return value from device_create_file() (and any and all such
  similar functions), handle failure appropriately.
- I don't think the tasklet stopping code is correct.  tasklet_disable()
  will prevent the callback from being called.  The del_timer_sync() will
  kill off the timer.  But the just-killed timer handler might have left
  the tasklet scheduled, and although it will not call the handler, the
  high-level tasklet code can still execute, and will then start playing
  with now-freed data.  A final tasklet_kill() should fix that up.
- Perhaps the probe function is requesting the IRQ too early?  The IRQ
  handler can perhaps be called while the hardware is still being set up. 
- Use INTF_TRIGGER_FALLING (etc), not the now-deprecated SA_TRIGGER_FALLING.
- The changelog needs work.  What's an OMAP? ;)
- Finally, by what authority does random_person@yahoo.com submit Nokia
  and TI's code??  Please review Section 11 of
  Documentation/SubmittingPatches, seek and obtain signoffs from the other
  authors and then add your own, thanks.
