Both symptoms of the same problem in my view, but I agree that other
perspectives are possible and perhaps even useful.  ;-)
We agree on the important thing, which is that the approach I was
calling out in the earlier email has some severe shortcomings, and
that we therefore need to do something different.

Agreed, either a function pointer or a flag.

Leaving out the "tremendous", yes, there would be some machinations.
It would certainly be OK by me if this can be avoided.  ;-)

If the per-CPU API was reasonably unifiable, I expect that it would
already be unified.  The problem is that the easy ways to unify it hit
some extremely hot code paths with extra cache misses -- for example, one
could add a struct percpu_data to each and every static DEFINE_PERCPU(),
but at the cost of an extra cache line touched and extra indirection
-- which I believe was deemed unacceptable -- and would introduce
initialization difficulties for the static case.
So, a fourth possibility -- can a call from start_kernel() invoke some
function in yours and Matt's code invoke init_srcu_struct() to get a
statically allocated srcu_struct initialized?  Or, if this is part of
a module, can the module initialization function do this work?
(Hey, I had to ask!)
						Thanx, Paul
