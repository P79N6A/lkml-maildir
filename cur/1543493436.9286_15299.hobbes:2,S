This A/D converter board is most likely just a A/D converter chip
and a few TTLs (yes, TTLs, not PLAs or eq.) tying it to the ISA
bus.  It is only remotely likely that it has a FIFO, so at 70 khz,
you only have a 14 us window to grab the sample off the board.  It
probably has a status register that indicates an overrun, but that
doesn't help anything, and for a few broken boards, an overrun means
that you have to power-cycle your computer.
These types of boards are relics of the mid-80's, and are horribly
overpriced for what they do, by perhaps a factor of 10 or 100.  I've
written Linux drivers for too many of them...
It's possible to use RTLinux to use this board effectively, but
it's akin to using a WinModem.  Not using RTLinux makes you
seriously vulnerable to interrupt latency.  Either case is a
waste of CPU.
