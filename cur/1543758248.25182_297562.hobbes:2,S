Hi,
I am implemeting a new system call for a project I'm working on. I added 
the system call to the file arch/i386/kernel/process.c and added the 
relevant entries in the files arch/i386/entry.S and 
include/asm-i386/unistd.h. My system call is made up of only two lines, 
a printk statement, and a return statement which gets the value of a 
field that I added to the task_struct structure.
I compiled and booted the kernel and am trying to build a user space 
application that uses my system call, however gcc is returning this error:
/tmp/cc4zgzUr.o(.text+0x4e): In functiono `get_rmt_paging':
: undefined reference to `errno'
Can anyone help me with this?
Thanks
Josef
