Hmmm, on Natalie's ping, I looked at this again.
setup_IO_APIC_irqs() actually consumes only 16 vectors.
This is because it only sets up the IRQs for pins
found with find_irq_entry(), which searches mp_irqs[]
which at this point contains only the legacy identify mappings.
The PNP code then takes a swing at things, and it registers
a handful of gsi's, but they are all duplicates of the legacy
mappings already set-up, so no additional vectors are consumed.
So on a big system, the large quantity of vectors will not be consumed
at
IOAPIC initialization time, but later at device probe time.
Not via request_irq(), but via pci_enable_device():
pci_enable_device()
 pci_enable_device_bars()
  pcibios_enable_device()
   pcibios_enable_irq() -> acpi_pci_irq_enable()
    acpi_register_gsi()
     mp_register_gsi()
      io_apic_set_pci_routing()
       entry.vector = assign_irq_vector(irq)
So except for the legacy IRQs, we are already allocating the vectors
on-demand, and that doesn't need to be fixed.
