[PATCH] I2C: Add ADM1025EB support to i2c-parport
The following patch adds support for the ADM1025 evaluation board to the
i2c-parport (and i2c-parport-light) driver(s). In fact, it happens that
it was already supported as an ADM1032 evaluation board, so it is just a
matter of documenting it correctly.
