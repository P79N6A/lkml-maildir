Exactly(!) for this reason CBUS was designed and implemented - 
to allow more inserts to arrive and process _them_, thus
do not slow down fast path, but not to make the whole delivering faster.

It is not main advantage.

And not event that is the main reason.

Not at all, OOM can not happen with limited queue length.
CBUS will fallback to the direct cn_netlink_send() in that case.
Cache utilisation and ability to send events from any context are
significant issues, but not they are the most important reasons.
Ability to not slow down fast pathes - that is the main reason,
even with higher delivery price.
Concider situation when one may want to have notification 
of each new write system call - let's say without such
notification it took about 1 second to write one page from userspace,
now with notification sending, which is not so fast, it will take
1.5 seconds, but with CBUS write() still costs 1 second plus
later, when we do not care about writing performance and scheduler
decides to run CBUS thread, those notifications will take additional
0.7 seconds instead of 0.5 and will be delivered.
But if one requires not delayed fact of the notification, but
almost immediate event - one can still use direct connector's methods.

Yes, as I said I run CBUS test with non-SMP machine too 
[it is still SMP with nosmp kernel option and SMP kernel].
On my the nearest test SMP machine it took ~930 - 950 msec average for fork
for both processors, so it is about 1850-1900 per processor 
[both with CBUS with fork connector and without fork connector compiled].
With CBUS and 1 CPU fork() + exit() time takes about 1780 - 1800 msec.
I can rerun test on Monday on diferent [and faster] machines, 
if you want.
