Now I quite agree that it isn't a Great Idea to do such conversion in
the kernel, but the problem still remains and there is no other place
we can do it. I belive that it should be done now and removed after
the world finishes to move to utf. Maybe it should not be applyed to
the main kernel tree, but I'm sure that at least Russian linux
distributions will like it.
