Hi Balbir and Shailabh,
I propose we add the capability to turn ON/OFF the multicase of
taskstats accounting data at do_exit().
This would allow 'chkconfig taskstats' like of control similar
to 'chkconfig acct' for BSD accounting. Sometimes sysadmins would
wish to turn off sending accounting data to the multicast socket.
We have seen many situations that our CSA customers need to turn
off CSA for a period of time.
I think this feature is very important to this new interface.
Thanks,
 - jay
