Subject: [PATCH] rd: Mark ramdisk buffers heads dirty
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I have not observed this case but it is possible to get a dirty page
cache with clean buffer heads if we get a clean ramdisk page with
buffer heads generated by a filesystem calling __getblk and then write
to that page from user space through the block device.  Then we just
need to hit the proper window and try_to_free_buffers() will mark that
page clean and eventually drop it.  Ouch!
To fix this use the generic __set_page_dirty_buffers in the ramdisk
code so that when we mark a page dirty we also mark it's buffer heads
dirty.
