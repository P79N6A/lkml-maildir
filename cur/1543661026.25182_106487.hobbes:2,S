I see what you mean, but I don't see how it makes it any less useful
to have them on the front page - if you download the latest kernel
patch from a mirror, you could then just click on the relevant link on
the front page of kernel.org - infact, as http access to kernel.org is
frequently much slower than ftp, it might actually be very useful,
because anybody downloading via http would make two requests, (OK,
about 7, because of the images on the front page), instead of about
13, if they traverse each directory to the .sign file.
