A better way to solve that problem is the way UltraSPARC-III do and
future ia64 systems will, by way of a "system tick" register which
increments at a constant rate regardless of how the cpus are clocked.
The "system tick" pulse goes into the processor, so it's still a local
cpu register being accessed.  Think of it as a system bus clock cycle
counter.
Granted, you probably couldn't make changes to the hardware you were
working on at the time :-)
