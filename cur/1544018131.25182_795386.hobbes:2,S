Won't work either, kstopmachine only preempts everybody. We'd require
something stronger.
What we need is a point where there's guaranteed no locks held, for
regular tasks that would be a trip to userspace and back, but for kernel
tasks that's a bit harder -- does the freezer stuff guarantee this?
Supposing we have such a point for all tasks, what you then do is wipe
all lock state and rig a trigger to start tracking lock state once you
passed through the point.
