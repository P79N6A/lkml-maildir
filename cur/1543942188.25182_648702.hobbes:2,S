I tend to adjust the max disk speed raid is allowed to use, since the
default of 200MB/s makes the system close to unusable while it is taking
place.  Could having slow disk access be causing things to lock up?
Things made much more sense some years ago when the default was 10MB/s
or something along those lines.
Who has 200MB/s capable hardware anyhow?
