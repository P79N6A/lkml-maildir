Can't get what you're talking about. A freelist of what?
Basically the idea of the custom lightweight allocation is the 
following: allocate a page and divide into regions of the same size, 
initialize and use these regions as a stack.
Next, why the current model prevents us from doing that. The array may 
be of any size thus we can't divide the page into regions of the same 
size: we can't predict what the maximum size will be. And this is the 
problem of the core.

Disagree. Let's look deeper. kmalloc itself is more heavyweght than 
setting up list memberships.
The list setting commands are pretty essential and will not add a lot to 
the assembly code.

This is the patch to your API, so I don't see why you're mentioning it here.
And your understanding is not quite correct. What if I'm going to send a 
chain of 5 messages? I'll allocate 5 spi_msg's in my case which all are 
gonna be of the same size -- thus the technique described above is 
applicable. In case of your core it's not.
And I'm not worrying that much about direct translation, I'm just trying 
to make your core acceptabe for us so that we could give up ours and 
work with yours.
So... it's just one more step towards convergence you are not likely to 
accept.

The problem is: we're using real-time enhancements patch developed by 
Ingo/Sven/Daniel etc. You cannot call kmalloc from the interrupt 
context  if you're using this patch. Yeah, yeah -- the interrupt 
handlers are in threads by default, but we can't go for that since we 
want immediate acknowledgement from the interrupt context, and that 
implies spi_message/spi_transfer allocation.

Not sure if I understand why it's relevant to what we're discussing.
