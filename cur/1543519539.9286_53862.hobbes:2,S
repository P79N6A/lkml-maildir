same user bug ;)
i actually had a clue because i rebooted precisely to set that option and i
let it suspend, tapped a key and that happened, so i typed in my password
and the penguin danced.
now, if i could get 2.3.x to stop losing the keyboard/mouse five seconds
after suspend-resume, i'd be a very happy camper.
