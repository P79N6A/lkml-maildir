Hi,
Seems I have the same problem. Sometimes whole system is locked,
sometimes keyboard is still active but others dead.
It does not happen till now since I run a silly script on background
to log the kernel messages:
-----------------
#!/bin/sh
while true; do
sleep 3
dmesg >/tmp/dmesg.txt
sync
done
-----------------
My video card is radeon x600 , fglrx driver is not used.
