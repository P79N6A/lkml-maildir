You misunderstand the problem. It isn't that the page cache has an
incorrect representation of the stream: the page cache is indeed
stopping filling as soon as it hits the EOF marker.
The problem is that we are stuffing the server-supplied cookies into
file->f_pos and using them to reconstruct where we are in the readdir
stream.
As there is no reserved 'EOF cookie' defined by the protocol that we
might use, we must either rely on the server giving us a unique cookie
also for the EOF case, or else mark the fact that filp->f_pos points
to EOF in some other way.
Cheers,
