To run correctly my script you _MUST_ have "fadvise" tool (my script assumes 
it is installed in current directory).
This is what Andrew said:

You'll need to unmount and remount the fs in between to remove the file
from pagecache.  Or use fadvise() to remove the pagecache.  There's a
little tool which does that in 
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/ext3-tools.tar.gz
_____________________________________________________________________
so "fadvise" is a simple tool that calls "fadvise64" system call.
This system call lets you do some useful things: for example you can discard 
all the cached pages for a file, that is what my command does.
