Ingo had CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=y, which generates heaps more writeout,
but no additional atime updates.
Ingo had a faster computer ;)  That will generate many more MB/sec
write traffic, so the cost of those atime seeks becomes proportionally
higher.  Basically: you're CPU-limited, Ingo is seek-limited.
