This helped out our machines quite a bit too.  Without the patch, we
weren't able to scale above 80000 IOPS, but now we exceed 110000 (and
parity with our internal XSCSI based tree).
Maybe the plug lists and locks should be per-device though, rather than
per-cpu?  That would make the migration case easier I think.  Is that
possible?
Thanks,
Jesse
