I did a quick grep through 2.6.14-rc2 to see how many "them all" were, 
and the only two places I could find, where a inequality operator was 
being used on a task state, were this one in kernel/signal.c and another 
in kernel/exit.c:
./kernel/exit.c:1194:               unlikely(p->state > TASK_STOPPED)
So maybe it is not so bad to just change these to a bit mask and 
disallow inequality comparisons in the future, if you guys feel that is 
the way to go...
