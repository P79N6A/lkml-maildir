A marking in the executable would have made more sense.
It is really broken having an unprivileged user being able to
create whole new executables but unable to lift this restriction
on those executables.
In any case, the restriction is common and troublesome.

Yes. There are unportable programs, and UNPORTABLE ones.
Memory layout can vary between vendor kernels, between normal
and 32-on-64 situations, between two different C libraries...

Nope. This can happen rapidly and repeatedly to pages
that are essentially random. The median length of a range
will be a page or two. Merging won't do very much at all.

That appears to have the exact same problem.

This part isn't about cost. It's about not leaving around
debris when the JIT crashes.

That won't get me a second mapping. Supposing that I had
a second mapping, SE Linux would deny the mprotect.
I'm looking for a mapping that is born executable or a mapping
that is born writable, as needed, so that no transition is needed.

Well cost is the problem here. I sure can find some way to
get the operation done, but it isn't cheap. For some usages,
the current setup is costly enough that one must consider
abandoning the hardware MMU in favor of a software one
emitted as part of the JIT. :-(
