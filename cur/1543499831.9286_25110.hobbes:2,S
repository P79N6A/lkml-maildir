Well, let me be the first to appologize.  I need to do a better job of
separating my frustrations so that people like you don't get dumped on. 
(Yes, I do have this problem and I am addressing it, just haven't
totally beaten it yet).  I am sorry.

This isn't as bad as I figured this was.  The poweroff one wasnt the one
I was worried about, it was the debug one more than anything.  So it
seems the above was a false concern of mine (small small addition of
bytes in RAM).

I will respond to this in reverse order.  I can see your point, you gain
a lot... is it possible to have a #ifdef APM_NO_DEBUG or similar for
those who have little/no problems when running APM to remove that 140
bytes of data, the one test, and whatever else is added?
My big worry is this, and yes I know this is insane, but right now where
the business I work is getting started, any savings helps (and power is
a big one).  Our servers have APM configured as on.  Currently the time
it takes for it to snap back to life is almost nil.  I am worried that
the debug stuff MAY cause some slow down in it comming back to life; in
going to sleep, I don't really care, take an extra 2 seconds (yes, this
is exagerated, but literally I wouldn't mind) to fall asleep.  Is my
worry justified about waking up?  I don't know what your code and test
all include.. I suppose I should have read your patch in the first place
instead of freaking out.
In light that Linux is supposed to be the land of chosing what is in
your kernel though, I do ask that you keep these things to a minimum.  I
do see your logi on the debug, still don't like the power off but have
no problems with a total of what, 12 bytes... but others may.
Again, I appologize for my tone.  I hope you will read my thoughts on
the matter now.  I will also go and read your patch to see what I really
think.
