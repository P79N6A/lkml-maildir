Subject: 2GB laptop has pcmcia_cs looking for _insane_ sockets

There can't be that many laptops with 2GB RAM, but surely this report
indicates an error somewhere in the pcmcia_cs code (it is looking for
socket number e9b91000 !!)  This bug is a feature of having 2GB ram in
the system and has nothing to do with specific PC cards drop back to 1GB
and all is well (linux 2.4.[19,20,21] and pcmcia_cs 3.2.[3,4]..):
	booting with 2GB ram:
kernel: Linux Kernel Card Services 3.1.22
kernel:   options:  [pci] [cardbus] [pm]
kernel: Yenta IRQ list 0000, PCI irq9
kernel: Socket status: 080c2420
kernel: Yenta IRQ list 0000, PCI irq11
kernel: Socket status: 000dd9e2
kernel: cs: socket e9b91000 timed out during reset.
at a guess, I might say "socket->cap.irq_mask" is wrong, and
I've never seen those Socket status numbers either.
is socket_info_t getting filled incorrectly when there is 2GB ram? 
	The "socket" number varies wildly from boot to boot:
kernel: cs: socket f68d0000 timed out during reset.  Try increasing
setup_delay.
kernel: cs: socket f626c800 timed out during reset.  Try increasing
setup_delay.
	revert that laptop to 1GB ram, and you get a happy PCMCIA slot:
kernel: Linux Kernel Card Services 3.1.22
kernel:   options:  [pci] [cardbus] [pm]
kernel: Yenta IRQ list 04f8, PCI irq9
kernel: Socket status: 30000006
kernel: Yenta IRQ list 04f8, PCI irq11
kernel: Socket status: 30000006
