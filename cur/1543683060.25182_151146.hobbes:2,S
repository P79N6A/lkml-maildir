well, AFAIK "make allyesconfig" is a debug target; ie. it 
shouldn't be succesful from a developer point of view.
I guess what you meant is if we want to say to final users
"the driver for your hardware doesn't compile" or "your hardware isn't
supported (unless you're a developer who wants to fix it)" in which case
i'd say "yes"
Or instead, "should make allyesconfig compile drivers marked as obsolete",
where i'd also say "yes"
But sadly i can't fix all those drivers so i'll stop whining and let the real
developers do whatever they want ;)
