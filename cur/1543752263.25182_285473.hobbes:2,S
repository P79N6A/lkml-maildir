Yeah, I don't like that either (thought I mentioned it in earliest
patch).  I thought about the method you mentioned, but didn't like it
much better.  I also suggested using 0 == default, 1 == can nice down,
2 == can set RT prio.  Utz suggests just splitting nice limit from rt
limit.

Wait, why can't it be done with (to date fictitious) pam_prio, which
simply calls sched_setscheduler?  It's already privileged while it's
doing these things...
