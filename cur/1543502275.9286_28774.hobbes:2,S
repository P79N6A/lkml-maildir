WHY you belive this is a SCSI driver problem ? There are must be A LOT OF
messages before loading of SCSI driver ! And you still not said where exactly
it hangs :-)

Via accessing driver through the SCSI BIOS :-) It is so simple as it is:
kernel and initrd disk is loaded with BIOS help (and so kernel must be
avaible to loading via BIOS!) and then it's booted. Acess via driver happens
on really late stage.
