Yeah, I guess so. I also noticed that running an older build (w/o ACPI
so it sees only 2 CPUs due to lack of HT - it's a dual Xeon HT machine
so there are 4 logical CPUs) seems a bit more stable, but it happens
there too.

I'm not using preemption. What made me just stare in wonder was when I
added a check in do_task_stat at the very beginning to the effect of:
if (!task) {
 printk(...);
 return -ENOENT;
}
/* dereference task as usual */
I *still* got the oops (and no message got logged). So either it is
used before the entry point (there is an occurrence of
sizeof(task->comm) but that should be statically determined by the
compiler, right?) or it is set to NULL in some magical way between the
check and usage (yep, it's still a race but the window should be
smaller I think).
The only place I can find a proc_inode.task field set to NULL is in
proc_pid_make_inode(). However, it is set to the value of task
parameter just a few instructions later. Am I right? Or can
proc_pid_make_inode get passed a NULL pointer?
I'm lost. Any assistance will be invaluable.
Best regards,
