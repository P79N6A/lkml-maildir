Subject: strange nic behavior

I have a nic here which acts somehow strange. When I load the
ne.o module while connected to the hub then link goes down. When
pull the connector from the hub and load the module and then plug
it back in, it works fine. I somehow suspect that the nic selects
the wrong media. How can I force it to use the rj45 connector and
not the bnc connector?
Regards
Martin
