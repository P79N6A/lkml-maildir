In my case, this is simple, I know my memory configuration, the RAM is
soldered directly on the board. But in the general case, booting linux
on a PC without a BIOS, the RAM sizing is not trivial, esp. since there
is many SDRAM devices out there, which does not follow Intel SDRAM spec.

I guess I can live without APM altogether.

You make me worried !
The Elan spec states that the PCI controller can function as a target
controller, to access the Elan's SDRAM. The DMA controller must use RAM as
target, this could be a major limitation.
It might be an idea to use a simpler ethernet controller. I need 100BaseT
though. The Intel 82559ER is cheap...
