Hmm...  Not good.

What we're seeing is we stress the hd's so much the whole system becomes
terribly slow whenever a disk access is needed.  Simply logging in on the
console takes ages then.  Perhaps this could explain those buffer
overruns ?

Nope.  Just X clients running on a remote X server.

Thanks for the info.  So the standard driver uses a software filter for
multicasts then ?  What does that mean ?  Not promiscuous mode, I suppose ?

I've been using '512 1024 2048' for the last series of tests.  I suppose
that's ok as well, or isn't it ?
