This is already covered in the 200 previous discussions about this -
basically maintenance and the fact that it raises the bar for other
people wanting to modify the code.
Oh and then there is the issue why you or I should bother changing our
perfectly valid code in order to make it easier for other people to
hack things in an unsupported language. If I happen to like a variable
called 'new' in my header file etc.
