Unfortunately your patches break with older tk:
Error in startup script: couldn't compile regular expression pattern: nested
*?+
    while executing
"regexp {([0-9A-Za-z_]+)="(.*?)"} $line foo var value"
    (procedure "read_config" line 18)
    invoked from within
"read_config $defaults"
    (file "scripts/kconfig.tk" line 21611)
make: *** [xconfig] Error 1
I've checked tk-8.0 and 8.0.3.
Some other comments:
- please generate patches as universal diff (-uNr options for diff are
  preferred)
- please follow indentation rules used in a file you modify.
  {header,tail}.tk are tab-indented, not spaces.
Regards
