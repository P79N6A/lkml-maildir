Yes indeed.

All those DMA stores get reflected to the CPUs (the north
bridge itself doesn't keep a cache directory).  All this
happens in-order.  There probably _is_ a window where the
last DMA store isn't yet globally visible but the CPU
interrupt was already signaled, but the act of trying to
access that data orders it itself :-)

That's only the store queue to the actual memory devices,
it's outside of the coherent domain anyway.
