Absolutely true. The attacker can do the "su" to any uid. Which is why the
server must be the one to provide the mapping service. The server does not
have to accept the UID unless it is one of the entries in the authorized map.
This isolates the penetration to only the accounts authorized to the
penetrated host.
And even root can be blocked from access to the server - in fact, root
could be mapped to any uid by the server (say for the purpose of remote
configuration files). The penetrated client can only access accounts that
were authorized by the server map.

It is only trusted to not misuse the uids that are mapped for that client. If
the client DOES misuse the uids, then only those mapped uids will be affected.
UIDS that are not mapped for that host will be protected.
It is to ISOLATE the penetration to the host that this is done. The server
will not and should not extend trust to any uid not authorized to that host. 
This is what the UID/GID maps on the server provide.
