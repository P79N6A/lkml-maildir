Who wrote that part of CodingStyle?
The script is certainly no substitute for personal review.
And it's certainly not the final say on anything.
(neither is CodingStyle AFAIK)
It's just a helper for Andrew.
The problem IMO is that we are seeing less and less patch review
but it needs to be more and more.  Andrew is one of a handful of
people who are reviewing lots of patches.  It shouldn't be his
wheelbarrow to have to push around all the time.  So if a little
automation can help Andrew, that's a good thing.  Until people
revolt, that is.
