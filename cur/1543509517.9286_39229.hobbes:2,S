 Hello :o)
 I was wondering if anyone has used the USB drivers in the new kernel, and if 
so, could tell me how well they work.
 Currently, my machine has a USB mouse, and I would like to use it in Linux.
 If you could give me some comments on the current stability of the drivers, 
and any known issues, I may look at using the 2.3.x kernel as a test run :o)
 Cheers.
