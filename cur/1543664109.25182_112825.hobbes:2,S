Pablo,
This may not be the most appropriate group to post this message, but I too
have such card. It's an ancient ISA SCSI device that lacks an IRQ
capability. I had mine briefly working on an old Genius ColorPage-CS
scanner, but it would only do very low (70dpi!!) resolution (the g_NCR5380
does not work too well with this card - there are no other drivers that
will even touch it) otherwise it would hang.
I am currently in the process of replacing this card with one that is more
supported on Linux. I don't think (unfortunately; for the both of us) that
this card will ever work properly on Linux (there were discussions about
it in 1997-1998 when the card was more available - bundled with devices
such as scanners, but nothing ever came about).
If you manage to prove me wrong (which I wish you would), please let me
know. I really wouldn't mind getting my card working on Linux.
Thanks,
Jonathan Thorpe
