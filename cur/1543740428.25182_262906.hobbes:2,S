Updating the BIOS doesn't actually fix my (Presario r3004).  The
Errata #93 message become less common, but aren't completely gone, and
the touchpad isn't recognized either way.  FWIW, a BIOS upgrade to my
wife's box (a supposed-to-be-identical notebook) makes the clock 3x
too fast.  So upgrading the BIOS, even if it fixed the USB hand-off
problem, would make the box unusable for this other problem.
