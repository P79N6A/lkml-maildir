Yes not writing is better than being unable to reboot.
There should be always a timeout at least for the reboot case.
Consider it from a uptime perspective: if something is really
screwed up (and that happens sometimes; classical example 
was the IO stack getting hung up forever in error handling
loops) the only way to get running again is to reboot and try again.
