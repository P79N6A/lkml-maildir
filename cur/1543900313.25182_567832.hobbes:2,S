I don't distinguish between "popular" and "non-popular" languages.  If 
somebody's willing to do the translation work, it's popular.  If nobody's 
willing to do the work, then even a language 1/3 of the planet's population 
speaks isn't "popular" for kernel development.
I wouldn't discourage a translator into Klingon if they were willing to keep 
their translation up to date and/or it actually resulted in patches.

The chinese mailing list is highly cool, and my first instinct was to note it 
on kernel.org/doc, but it would be better if the chinese website I already 
link to notes it instead.  (That way I don't have to worry about how to 
spam-guard your email address. :)
This also highlights the need for language maintainers to help the patches go 
upstream to the english list.  (If we can avoid armchair commentators 
saddling them with the task of translating the entire Documentation directory 
and keeping such a translation up to date, we might actually get one too.  
Fielding patches and questions sounds like plenty to me...)
Could you ask on said list if anyone is likely to volunteer for the position?  
(JUST translating patches and questions, as part of pushing code upstream.)

Obvious counter-arguments include the floppy driver, the floppy tape driver, 
the tty layer, and most of the existing english Documentation directory...
I'll happily stay out of the way of people who actually want to merge 
translations of documentation into the kernel.  I reserve the right to say "I 
told you so" in about five years.

From a language maintainer's perspective documentation patches wouldn't be any 
different than any other patches.  Translate the description and questions 
going back and forth.  The patch itself doesn't get translated when it's C 
and applies to scripts/kconfig/, why would it when it's UTF-8 and applies to 
Documentation/?
Of course this brings up the question "what kind of function and variable 
names do chinese people pick?"  (I honestly don't know, but I note that 
attempts to use names that don't fit in 7-bit ascii would probably be frowned 
upon in a big way...)

A list works fine as a point of contact.  I note that in general, maintainers 
are individuals (who delegate like mad, of course), because otherwise agenda 
items languish with everyone thinking it's someone else's responsibility.

Hmmm...  Now I'm wondering if I should link directly to the docs pages of the 
chinese and japanese sites, or to the top level community pages?
