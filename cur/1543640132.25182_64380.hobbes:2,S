Hi Folks,
 i am porting our existing network driver that runs on 2.2.x to kernel 2.4.x. i see that pci_dev struct has changed & it no longer contains the base_address[] field. since our device supports both IOMapped & MMIO Mapped space, it used to get the same from base_address[0] & base_address[1]. with the new kernel, how do i get that?
best regards,
HARISH V
