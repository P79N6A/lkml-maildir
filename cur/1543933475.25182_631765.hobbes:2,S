Hi,
another one most likely related to the recent NFS_V4 define build error
saga:
  CC      fs/nfs/super.o
fs/nfs/super.c: In function 'nfs_sb_deactive':
fs/nfs/super.c:338: error: 'TASK_NORMAL' undeclared (first use in this function)
fs/nfs/super.c:338: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
fs/nfs/super.c:338: error: for each function it appears in.)
fs/nfs/super.c: In function 'nfs_put_super':
fs/nfs/super.c:349: error: 'TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE' undeclared (first use in this function)
fs/nfs/super.c:349: error: implicit declaration of function 'schedule'
make[3]: *** [fs/nfs/super.o] Error 1
make[2]: *** [fs/nfs] Error 2
make[1]: *** [fs] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.6.24-rc6-mm1.system-gate-patch'
make: *** [debian/stamp-build-kernel] Error 2
This was hand-patched from earlier kernel versions, however I wouldn't
think there was any problem due to this (a cleanly extracted version
doesn't show any md5sum difference for fs/nfs/super.c).
[plus hotfix x86-fix-system-gate-related-crash.patch]
I'm circa 120% sure there must be a sched.h include missing there, given the
whereabouts of these APIs ;)
