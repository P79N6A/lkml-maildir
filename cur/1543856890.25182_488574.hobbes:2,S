Each phy_device structure now has a dev_flags field that can be  
modified by the controller's code upon connecting.  The PHY driver  
can then check that field for PHY-specific, platform-specific  
interactions.  For instance, on the newer CDS, there's a Marvell PHY  
which requires configurable resistance changes to work in RGMII  
mode.  So there's a flag for that.  Basically, each PHY driver  
specifies its own flags, and the platform code is currently  
responsible for setting those flags appropriately.  A string might be  
more flexible, but I'm operating on the hope that there shouldn't be  
too many of these.
For Fiber mode, or other such changes, we might want to add another  
field, like the interface field, to describe standard external  
interfaces.  The call to phy_connect() is beginning to get a bit  
long, though.
