In autofs, I use the following technique to determine if the IP number
for a host is local (and therefore vfsbinds can be used rather than
NFS mounts):
connect a datagram socket (which won't produce any actual traffic) to
the remote host with INADDR_ANY as the local address, and then query
the local address.  If the local address is the same as the remote
address, the address is local.
