This is the definition of the argument to the VTXIOCGET* IOCTLs:
typedef struct 
{
	int page;	/* number of requested page (hexadecimal) */
	int hour;	/* requested hour (hexadecimal) */
	int minute;	/* requested minute (hexadecimal) */
	int pagemask;	/* mask defining which values of the above are set */
	int pgbuf;	/* buffer where page will be stored */
	int start;	/* start of requested part of page */
	int end;	/* end of requested part of page */
	void __user *buffer;	/* pointer to beginning of destination buffer */
}
vtx_pagereq_t;
The driver returns all data in the buffer field. Copying there is done by a seperate call to
copy_to_user(). All other fields are never changed by the driver. So the _IOW definition is ok.

Thank you! Andrew, could you please forward the patch?
