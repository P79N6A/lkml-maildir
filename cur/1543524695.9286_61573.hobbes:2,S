The other thing that I think needs fixing is that passing NULL is
that you lose information.  I think we should define something
like:
	#define ISA_DMA ((struct pci_dev *) NULL)
for now, but later we could have something more like:
	struct pci_dev { dma_mask: 0xFFFFFF; } __isa_dma;
	#define ISA_DMA (&__isa_dma)
The reason is that the new mechanism supports a nice way to
control what part of memory (from the bus's perspective)
via the "pci_dev.dma_mask" value, which is an intellegent
replacement for GFP_DMA.  However, if we have multiple
"pci like" busses without per-device instances of
"struct pci_dev" then the current API wouldn't allow these
busses to have different memory needs.
