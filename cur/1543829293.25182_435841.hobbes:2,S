I think it was about 2 years back. We weren't going to re-invent after
that point, we had a full implementation at that time.
If i remember correct, we concluded that some design constraints and
additional overhead were the reasons for not proceeding in that
direction.
BTW, if i remember correct, PAGG folks also promised to look at CKRM to
see if they could use CKRM instead.
