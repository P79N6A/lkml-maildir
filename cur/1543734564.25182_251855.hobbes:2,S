Certainly if you run ppp the serial port won't like being ignored that 
long, and if you pull down data on a parallel port that really won't 
like it. The soundcard is probably only a problem if you're recording 
input, in spite of some posts here about skipping, the world doesn't end 
if you get a skip, although 2ms shouldn't cause that anyway.
