hm, could you try to strace it and/or attach gdb to it and figure out 
what's wrong? (perhaps involving the Kaffeine developers too?) As long 
as it's not a kernel level crash i cannot see how the scheduler could 
directly cause this - other than by accident creating a scheduling 
pattern that triggers a user-space bug more often than with other 
schedulers.
