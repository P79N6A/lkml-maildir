But in practice the variable does not need to be an atomic type for UP, but
simply a word, since stores are atomic on UP systems, no?
Several arches seem to use additional atomicity instructions on 
atomic functions:
PPC:
static __inline__ void atomic_add(int a, atomic_t *v)
{
        int t;
        __asm__ __volatile__(
"1:     lwarx   %0,0,%3         # atomic_add\n\
        add     %0,%2,%0\n"
        PPC405_ERR77(0,%3)
"       stwcx.  %0,0,%3 \n\
        bne-    1b"
        : "=&r" (t), "=m" (v->counter)
        : "r" (a), "r" (&v->counter), "m" (v->counter)
        : "cc");
}
"lwarx" and "stwcx." wouldnt be necessary for updating nr_pagecache 
on UP.
SPARC:
int __atomic_add_return(int i, atomic_t *v)
{
        int ret;
        unsigned long flags;
        spin_lock_irqsave(ATOMIC_HASH(v), flags);
        ret = (v->counter += i);
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(ATOMIC_HASH(v), flags);
        return ret;
}
