Hello Kernel listees
I have a question about ioports on PCI devices but first: If
there is a better mailing list for asking these types of questions
would you kindly direct me there.
The question is this. When do I need to use ioremap for ioports
on a PCI device (PC architecture)? Is the answer: always except
when the physical address is within the 64K - 1M ISA region (legacy
ports).
Thanks,
Daniel
