Thanks a lot. :-) This patch is working as expected for me. Now, after
doing a:
  echo LID > /proc/acpi/wakeup_devices
  echo SLPB > /proc/acpi/wakeup_devices
I can resume by opening the laptop, or by using the Fn button, or by
using the power button. :-)
This patch seems "very" old (first release 2003-10-28).
Anyone know why this patch is not in the kernel source tree at this
time ?
Good day, and thanks for your help.
