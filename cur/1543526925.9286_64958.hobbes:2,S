There should be no problem with 'ls' dying with an I/O error if the mount fails.  I check the
device exists and the grab the target dentry.  All this works (even the mounting, which surprised me...)
Once I've got the /proc stuff working (turning out to be the hardest bit, actually...) I can write a perl
script to do the unmounting.  Then it'll work how I want it.
eg.  On my machine I have /mnt/cdrom as ISO9660 and /mnt/dvd as UDF.  I will be able to chdir between them if necessary.
Also, when I'm searching my CDROM collection for a file, I can stay in the /mnt/cdrom directory, insert a cd, do 'ls', eject it, put the next one in, etc... (I'm not sure how easy it will be to allow unmount if a process has its cwd on the mount, but it would be the ultimate in ease of use if I could make that bit work).
The whole patch is turning out to be very small...  A credit to the writers of the VFS who gave it a very logical and simple structure.
Tony
