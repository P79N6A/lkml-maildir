I need to rename the BUF_PAGE_SIZE to BUF_SIZE, since it is not really a 
page. I'm moving to keep a header on each page so that I can use splice 
and still be able to process the pages elsewhere. The BUF_SIZE is the size 
of the PAGE - that header.
I think it is too early to move the ringbuffer to bigger than a page sub 
buffers.
