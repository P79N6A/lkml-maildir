I'm running Linux on a single-board computer that uses an Intel
ethernet chip, apparently i82557 compatible.  The 2.2.17 kernel boots
OK.  The 2.4.10 kernel fails to initialize the chip complaining
[thanks to kernel message scrollback]:
eth0: Intel Corporation 82557 [Ethernet Pro 100], 00:60:92:00:17:F4, IRQ 11
  Board assembly 721383-006, Physical connectors present: RJ45
  Primary interface chip 82555 PHY #1
Self test failed, status ffffffff:
  Failure to initialize the i82557.
  Verify that the card is in a bus-master capable slot.
   
When the 2.2.17 kernel boots, it reports that
  The receiver lock-up bug exists -- enabling workaround.
and all of the tests succeed.  The rest of the messages are the same
except for driver version information.
