I know that this whole effort has been put in disarray by the
prosecution of Hans Reiser, but I'm curious as to its status.  Is
Reiser4 going to be going into the Linus kernel anytime soon?  Is there
somewhere I should be looking to find this out without wasting bandwidth
here?
I'm not an LKML subscriber.
Thanks,
