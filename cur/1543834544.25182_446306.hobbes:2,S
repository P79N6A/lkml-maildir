Hm, how about using bitmap instead of table ? (we'll have many holes but...)
Implementing
- sytem-wide bitmap of used tgid which is updated only when /proc is opened
seems not to be much problem. 32k kmalloc can store 256k pids.
BTW, how large pids and how many proccess in a (heavy and big) system ?
