The Dell firmware version on the card currently is 1.06.  I have not found a
newer firmware version than that one.

The config help for the megaraid drivers suggested that the new megaraid
driver would not support a PERC2.  I had enabled both drivers in the kernel
which is having this problem.:
CONFIG_MEGARAID_NEWGEN=y
CONFIG_MEGARAID_MM=y
CONFIG_MEGARAID_MAILBOX=y
CONFIG_MEGARAID_LEGACY=y
After your suggestion I rebuilt the kernel with legacy disabled.:
CONFIG_MEGARAID_NEWGEN=y
CONFIG_MEGARAID_MM=y
CONFIG_MEGARAID_MAILBOX=y
# CONFIG_MEGARAID_LEGACY is not set
The new megaraid driver does not detect the PERC2/DC just as I feared it
would not.  Unless I'm missing some kernel commandline arguments necessary
to make the new driver find the card, I'm stuck with legacy.
