At the risk of  being repetitive to the point of tiresome, my point is that 
there are no real time requirements in games. You're assuming that 
everything will be better if we assume that there are rt requirements and 
that we're simulating pseudo real time conditions currently. That's just not 
the case and never has been. That's why it has worked fine for so long.
