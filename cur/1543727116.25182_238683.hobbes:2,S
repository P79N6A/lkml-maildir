Okay, I've now found the comments about specifying values
for iocharset and codepage, and read-write works again.
However, IMHO the 'mount' command should simply refuse to
mount a FATfs read/write unless iocharset and codepage are
specified.  As things stand now, 'mount' reports the fs is
mounted rw when it simply is not true.
