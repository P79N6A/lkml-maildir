   Could someone explain the scheduling policy around bottom-halfs,
   task_queues and timer_lists.  If one of the functions has been called
   from these types, are they subject to normal time slicing or are they
   allowed to run to completion?  The documentation I've read doesn't
   really address this point.
All kernel code is not preemtible unless the kernel functions explicitly
call schedule() or attempt to get a lock or call some other function
which might block and allow another kernel to run.
Functiosn which are triggered by bottom-half, task_queues, and
timer_lists are run at interrupt time, so they are not allowed call a
function which may block or call schedule().
