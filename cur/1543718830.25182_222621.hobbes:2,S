Hmm, that was intentional (my very first cut at this thing cleared it,
but that patch had many other broken behaviours).  Specifically because
it goes through pI, which POSIX draft says is untouched through exec.

Yup, I changed that since then, using the secflags approach you did.

I had same idea.  I wished we could hijack keep_capabilities as a
bit vector.

How do you keep passing down the same caps through multiple execs?

Yeah.  It depends on the definition of useful.  Get a couple privileged
tasks running (which may fork/exec from time to time), then clamp down
the machine is one form of useful.  In general, I don't cap_bset is that
useful though.

I can add this to the test stuff to play with it.
