From my investigation i have found that my box stores routes based on
icmp redirects (as seen with netstat -C) and it does learn the routes
but not for all routes. Please look at this printout:
<snip>
dns.toxicfilms. trek13.sv.av.co nihil.ae.poznan       0      0        4 eth1
dns.toxicfilms. nms.cyf-kr.edu. alnair.ae.pozna       0      0        6 eth1
<snip>
dns.toxicfilms.tv is my box
nihil.ae.poznan.pl is the router that routes to my other public nets
alnair.ae.poznan.pl is the Internet Gateway.
Why did not my box learn to send packets to trek13.sv.av.com via alnair ?
it's 2.4.20-xfs, no other patches.
I am running a similar box on the same net with 2.5.66-mm2 and i do not
see this effect, thus i presume, it's not a configuration error.
Having one default route via Router A (nihil) should cause only one
redirect per one connections. But i get flooded for every packet.
Regards,
Maciej
