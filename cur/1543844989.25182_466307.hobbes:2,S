so you remove a security check ...

... to add a "security" feature?
sounds like the wrong tradeoff!
If you can mmap PROT_EXEC the "noexec" mount option doesn't mean
anything! Because a elf binary loader is easily written in
perl/shell/whatever, the kernel "x" bit is just a convenience there!
The PROT_EXEC check at least makes it a bit harder to do anything like
this; not impossible obviously
