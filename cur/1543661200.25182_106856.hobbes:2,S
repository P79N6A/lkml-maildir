Yes, but people already expect to run depmod at boot, and I haven't
made depmod safe for cross compiling.  It could be done, but is it
worth it?  I don't know.
BTW, the reason for using the alias mechanism is that aliases are
useful in themselves: consider you write a "new_foo" driver, you can
do "MODULE_ALIAS("foo")" and so no userspace changes are neccessary.
module-init-tools 0.9.8 already supported this.

OK.  Fortunately I have a new version of the table2alias program which
takes the elf object directly, anyway, which has the benifit of being
faster, too.

Great minds think alike: this was what Greg said.  I did this in the
updated patch.

I prefer to keep special symbols out of section names, so we can do
nice tricks later with __start_.  So __discard_modalias would be my
preference if we're going to change it.

Yeah, I thought you'd say that 8).  I consider this to be after
modversions in the queue, and I don't want to overload you.

Well, you get them as warnings from depmod, but more timely checks is
good.

We can already figure what symbols it uses in depmod: the original
modprobe did just that, but Adam Richter complained about speed with
1200 modules (sure, it's < 1 second for most people, but Debian on an
old 486 would suck hard).
But putting the dependent module names in a section... I must say I
rather like that.  I'll have to mull it over though.
