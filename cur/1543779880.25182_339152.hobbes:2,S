A couple of minor things thus far:
o	I get a linker error from V0.7.52-12:
	net/built-in.o(.init.text+0x898): In function `sock_aio_read':
	include/net/sock.h:625: undefined reference to `__you_cannot_kmalloc_that_much'
	This is not making much sense to me, since line 625 of sock.h
	is a small function with a container_of() as its only statement.
	The other other kmalloc() I can find in sock_aio_read() is
	allocating a "struct sock_iocb", which is certainly small enough
	for kmalloc() to handle.
	This may be a problem specific to the machine I compiled on,
	so am retrying on another.  Though that machine had absolutely
	no problem compiling and running V0.7.51-27...
	Enlightenment?
o	I messed up the #ifdefs for CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU, CONFIG_RCU_STATS,
	and CONFIG_RCU_TORTURE_TEST so that it is not possible to build any
	of the following:
	1.	CONFIG_RCU_STATS without also CONFIG_RCU_TORTURE_TEST.
	2.	CONFIG_RCU_TORTURE_TEST without also CONFIG_RCU_STATS.
	3.	CONFIG_RCU_TORTURE_TEST without also CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU.
		Which makes it tough to torture-test stock RCU.  ;-)
	Am checking out fixes for these, will post once I have untangled
	and tested.  Does not affect people who are not working directly
	on the RCU infrastructure itself.
							Thanx, Paul
