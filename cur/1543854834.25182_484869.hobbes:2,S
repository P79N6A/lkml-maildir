Yes, that's the message.

I've added some printk()s in underrun handler. There's still some data
in the ring (tail=29, head=32), so the driver seems okay. The list of
descriptors:
  tx_ring[28].ctrl=0x8000850e (used=1 wrap=0 und=0 last=1)
  tx_ring[29].ctrl=0x900085ea (used=1 wrap=0 und=1 last=1) TAIL
  tx_ring[30].ctrl=0x000085ea (used=0 wrap=0 und=0 last=1)
  tx_ring[31].ctrl=0x0000850e (used=0 wrap=0 und=0 last=1)
  tx_ring[32].ctrl=0x800085ea (used=1 wrap=0 und=0 last=1) HEAD
  tx_ring[33].ctrl=0x8000850e (used=1 wrap=0 und=0 last=1)
Buffer addresses look fine, tx_ring[29..32].addr don't differ much from
the rest.

Looks like I'll have to wait for upstream support of 9260, because I'm
new to ARM and I won't handle it by myself. Anyway thanks for your help.
