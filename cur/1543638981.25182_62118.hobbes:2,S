This is not about 'freedom'. This is about modifying some hardware
to make it pretend that it's something that it is not. It's completely
unlike IP addresses or anything like that. It is supposed to uniquely
identify a piece of hardware. It's like the "frequency of a radio station"
where the IP address is like the "call sign".
