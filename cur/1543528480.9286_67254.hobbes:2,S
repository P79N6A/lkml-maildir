Subject: Clearing MASQ Entries

Does anyone know a way to clear all of the MASQ entries from the
kernal tables?
I run my nameserver behind a MASQ router which has a dial-up
connection.  If the connection goes down and gets assigned a new
IP when it brings the link back up, my nameserver is
non-functional until the MASQ entry for the nameserver's UDP port
times out.  TCP connections are fine as they just drop, but any
UDP connection is hosed.  I need a way to tell the kernel to
delete all of the entries in the MASQ table in ip-up so that
things will work properly.
