Thanks that you ask! 
I really should have mentioned it in my initial posting.
Yes, this change was intentional, as it in fact fixes a possible bug in the original code.
Section 4.1.6 in RFC 4122 states regarding the "NodeID":
:  For systems with no IEEE address, a randomly or pseudo-randomly
:  generated value may be used; see Section 4.5.  The multicast bit must
:  be set in such addresses, in order that they will never conflict with
:  addresses obtained from network cards. 
So up to now it was just pure ("random") luck if this bit was set or not.
While at it...
My patch addressed another small non-critical glitch in the current implementation as well.
An "strace cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid" shows:
: ....
: open("/proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE) = 3
: fstat64(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0444, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
: read(3, "378244d0-9b27-4f92-8b3a-386ed526"..., 1024) = 37
: write(1, "378244d0-9b27-4f92-8b3a-386ed526"..., 37378244d0-9b27-4f92-8b3a-386ed52692a8) = 37
: read(3, "", 1024)                       = 0
: close(3)                                = 0
: ...
The first read() returns the newly generated random uuid.
The second read() just returns zero, but the current implementation then already created a new uuid which wasn't used at all.
Although this is not critical, it was nevertheless leaking unnecessarily entropy from the pool.
For the case of the new time-based UUIDs it was worse. It unnecessary incremented the clock_seq number.
This issue is addressed by this part of my patch (esp.: "*ppos > 0"):
@@ -1191,13 +1317,13 @@ static int proc_do_uuid(ctl_table *table, int write, struct file *filp,
        ctl_table fake_table;

-       uuid = table->data;
-       if (!uuid) {
-               uuid = tmp_uuid;
-               uuid[8] = 0;
+       /* random/time UUIDs need to be read completely at once */
+       if (table->ctl_name != RANDOM_BOOT_ID && *ppos > 0) {
+               *lenp = 0;
+               return 0;
        }
