That one of the problems, there are no reliable serial numbers or
things of the kind.  It all becomes heuristics (model name, capacity,
partitioning, actual contents...) which kinda suck to have in kernel
space.

If I understand USB correctly, it's all point-to-point, there is no
broadcast going on.  For enumeration purposes hubs are not
transparent, and ports are separated.  But I wouldn't rely on the
ports numbers on hubs to stay constant w.r.t the physical ports.  I
don't think it's required.

Since it's an hotplug bus, enumeration before suspend happened as the
devices were plugged in.  So the order a reboot enumeration will see
them is unknown in practice.
It may be fixable by storing some kind of physical address in the
tree, but losing a filesystem because you replugged the usb drive in
the wrong physical port between suspend and resume would be annoying.
And I don't know how stable the "physical" positions are in the first
place.
