Latest version that worked for me was test7.

I tried but this didn't make any difference. No surprise because the
ide-scsi also causes a hangup if the sr driver is not loaded.
Since the test9-pre2 was out yesterday evening I gave it a try. No
difference, also hangs after probing the first ide device.
I understood there are some problems in the scsi subsystem; especially
difference in behaviour regarding if modules are used or not. In my config
the adaptec aha-2940uw (AIC7xxxx) is included in the kernel image, while the
ide-scsi is compiled as a module. Perhaps this does matter...
from my .configure:
#
# SCSI support
#
CONFIG_SCSI=y
#
# SCSI support type (disk, tape, CD-ROM)
#
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SD=y
CONFIG_SD_EXTRA_DEVS=40
CONFIG_CHR_DEV_ST=m
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SR=m
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SR_VENDOR=y
CONFIG_SR_EXTRA_DEVS=2
CONFIG_CHR_DEV_SG=m
#
# Some SCSI devices (e.g. CD jukebox) support multiple LUNs
#
CONFIG_SCSI_DEBUG_QUEUES=y
# CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN is not set
CONFIG_SCSI_CONSTANTS=y
CONFIG_SCSI_LOGGING=y
#
# SCSI low-level drivers
#
CONFIG_SCSI_AIC7XXX=y
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_TCQ_ON_BY_DEFAULT=y
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_CMDS_PER_DEVICE=8
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_PROC_STATS=y
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_RESET_DELAY=5
