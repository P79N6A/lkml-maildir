Unfortunately, the number of apps is far too large for one person
to hope to give decent coverage here, let alone all the *combinations*
that people use.
We simply have to rely on testers to report problems. Of course I
do run my own changes on my desktop, and I have a selection of things
to test that have been reported to cause problems in the past...
It would be an idea to set up some regression test machines somewhere
for this sort of thing though. Unfortunately I don't have the
resources.
