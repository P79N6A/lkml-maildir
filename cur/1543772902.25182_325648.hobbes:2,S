That's a bug.
The standards say that sync() is supposed to "start" I/O, or something
similarly vague and waffly.  The Linux implementation of sync() has always
started all I/O and then waited upon all of it before returning from
sync().
And umount() itself will sync everything to disk, so the additional sync()
calls should be unnecessary.
That being said, if umount was leaving dirty filesystems then about 1000000
people would be complaining.  So there's something unusual about your
setup.
What filesystem?  What kernel version?  Any unusual bind mounts, loopback
mounts, etc?  There must be something there...
