Subject: [PATCH] update URL for ipmasqadm in Configure.help
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/1/8/214

The URL is out of date (and it is fairly hard to find the replacement).
The Linux IP Masquerade HOWTO also has this obsolete URL.
Note: I have nothing to do with either site.
