This is very useful functionality. I'm currently looking at a similar 
patch for the 2.4 series, taken from
http://www.kernel.at/pub/linux/kernel/people/hch/patches/v2.4/2.4.18-pre4/
which seems to work fine so far (with very limited testing). This patch 
gives information that is really needed to maintain systems that 
actually use their disks, such as mail, database and news servers.
May I vote for inclusion in the mainline kernel, both 2.4 and 2.5? 
Again, it is an important part of server maintainability.
