No. You need to put a hole in physical space. You actually need to turn off
some of RAM and things, You will also need a chipset that bothers to decode
all memory above RAM strictly as ISA/PCI and isnt just saying "below 1Gig is
ram, cos the bios knows that too" or similar.

Consult the chipset documentation. You've got the kernel hole right I think,
now you need to do the hardware hole
