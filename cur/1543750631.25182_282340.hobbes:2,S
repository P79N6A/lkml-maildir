Hi Linus,
Modular floppy builds are still broken in -bk5. Can you merge in Jeff's 
patch below?

   block/floppy.c: fix build by removing UTS_RELEASE use
   
   It's redundant to the kernel message that prints out the kernel version,
   as well as many other places where one can request the kernel version.
