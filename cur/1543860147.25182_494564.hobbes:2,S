I don't think so. I did reduce the target size
#define TARGETSIZE (100 << 12)
to make the program finish a little quicker, and for some reason I get
linus-test.c: In function 'remap':
linus-test.c:61: error: 'POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED' undeclared (first use in
this function)
when I compile the program, so I replaced POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED with 4
as defined in /usr/include/bits/fcntl.h.
Other than these two changes, the program is identical to the version
you posted.
I have run the program a few times, and the output is pretty
consistent. However, when I increase the target size, the difference
between the expected and actual values is larger.
