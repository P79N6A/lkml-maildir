Hi I'm moweon.
Now I'm making redundancy module in my jbd based file system.
When I tesed and dumped its block, I found one funny stuation.
First I modified */commit.c/* in jbd directory to print commit complete
message and it's block number.
( add printk after wait_on_buffer )
After I saw this message from kernel just like this
(*NOTICE: Commit complete , its block number : 560 *)
I read its contents from block number 1 to 101 into file
And I read it again after suddenly turn off my work station.
, I think it must has same value becuase journal commit block was
already written behind block number 101 .
But when I campared two file, it's different .
Why it happen? Does jbd use some trick in block management?
