thanks for all the help...
In my 2.0.36 headers it says:
#define AF_PACKET       17      /* Forward compat hook          */
Is this supported in 2.0.36?  
Anyway, I found sergei Viznyuk's dhcp client (which is says "runs on 2.1-2.3")
(which I found when I was running 2.2 kernels on that machine).
But a better error message (other the net-pf-17) would be very useful...
Is there a client which runs on both 2.0 and 2.2?
