Hi,
I sent this out before but I still haven't solved my shutdown (halt)
problem with my Tyan Trinity 100AT.  I've upgraded to the latest and
greatest BIOS version 1.16 and the kernel still Oops when it goes to
"Power Down" the machine.  It's done this with Red Hat 6.0 with
kernels 2.2.5-15, 2.2.5-22, and 2.2.12.
Currently I'm using 2.2.12 since that was my last attempt.
Here's the info from the dump:
Oops:   0000
CPU:    0
EIP:    0010:[<c010a1ad>]
EFLAGS: 00010046
This is repeatable every time with the same info.
I've tried just disabling the -p in the /etc/rc.d/init.d/halt script
but that is more of a kludge than getting a fix for the problem.
Thanks,
Tuan
