Why are we discussing this again? The Linux kernel is distributed
under the GPLv2 and even though there are some legal gray areas
regarding derived work (think nvidia and ati binary blobs here), the
license is not friendly towards proprietary drivers at all.
Furthermore, many of the _kernel developers_ do not support
proprietary drivers, so why do you insist on using Linux for that
purpose?
Seriously, you really really want to look at the BSDs or proprietary
operating systems because they support your needs much better.
