Hi,
Try using more files, and of smaller size.  I was using /usr/bin, which
has 3632 files, and 571M total.
I am using XFS filesystem: /dev/mapper/vg--all-lv--usr on /usr type xfs
(rw,noatime,logbsize=262144,logbufs=8,logdev=/dev/sdg6,inode64)

Try 16 threads, so that there is more contention on the read side as well.
