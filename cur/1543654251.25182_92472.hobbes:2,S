I suppose so, but the v850 is not exceptional in this regard.
The various relocation type constants (R_...) in elf.h are completely
unused in the kernel on _every_ architecture, except by the new module
loader.
If tidying is needed, then it seems like the best thing would be to move
all the arch-specific stuff into the corresponding <asm/elf.h> file for
each architecture.  I presume the reason this hasn't been done is simply
convention -- userland elf.h files are also giant conglomerations of
defines for every supported architecture ...
