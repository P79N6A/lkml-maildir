Netscape 4.x has been 'spontaneously shutting down' since as far as I can recall, on
both Debian and RedHat, under 2.0 and 2.1 kernels.  This is nothing kernel related,
maybe indirectly if at all.  This is a problem that should be taken up with Netscape
(or whoever it is that manages the browser source code) since this has been a long
standing problem among a great many users of all kernel versions.
Maybe it uses a bad memory management scheme under Linux/Unix and it surfaces itself
under Linux/X Windows.  This is a posibility, but I wouldn't stick my neck out so
far (on he lkml)  and say it's kernel related, because tehre are MANY X apps that
don't spontaneously close themselves.  If it were a less centralized problem...
well..
