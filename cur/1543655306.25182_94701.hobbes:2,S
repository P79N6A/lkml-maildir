That's a transmit underrun - data is not being fed into the NIC
across the PCI bus fast enough.  Possibly something has gone
wrong with the busmastering logic on the mainboard, or the NIC.
The driver will reset the transmitter when this happens, as per the
manual.  There's not much else we can do.

This may not be related to the driver at all.  A ksymoops trace
of this info is needed.
The 595 is a very old and slow NIC, and sometimes has problems
interworking on the PCI bus.  You'd be best off getting a new
card, frankly.
