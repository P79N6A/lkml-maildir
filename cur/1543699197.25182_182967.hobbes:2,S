Hallo,
don't know, whom to adress.
I've following problem: Every Linux-Kernel above 2.4.22 crashes with  
capslock and scrolllock blinking, nothing in the message-log, and all i  
can do is magic-sysreq and boot.
The problem seems to be reproducable: It seems to occur, when my son wants  
to use my pc as a router to the internet. So for detail:
My pc acts as a dsl-router  on "half"demand with packtfiltering and masq  
(ipchains) for 2 windows-pcs.
"Half"demand means, my son has to make a "ping 10.0.0.2" to open an  
outgoing connection, to prevent a bunch of windows tools opening unwanted  
connections using "DoD".
But this all works fine under 2.4.18 to 2.4.22. I haven't any idea, what  
that could be in 2.4.23.
If i should be more precise, please tell me what i should document.
Regards--
Ulrich
