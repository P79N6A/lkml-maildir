Yes, the problem is in the -ac train only.  It's the "processor id"
field that has been added to /proc/cpuinfo which is confusing libc's
way of counting CPUs.
That's a libc bug.  But there's also a kernel bug with that field
it appears.
The kernel bug: the "processor id" fields are both printing zero.
Possibly because show_cpuinfo() in arch/i386/kernel/setup.c prints
directly out of phys_proc_id as at the time it's called, but
smpboot.c declates phys_proc_id as __initdata (either that, or
phys_proc_id is actually zero for both CPUs?).
David.
