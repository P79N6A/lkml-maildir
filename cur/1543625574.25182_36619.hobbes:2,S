Hello,
Does anyone know a descent driver for the C-Media 8783?
The current driver included in kernel 2.4.18 does work correctly, except for
the FM-chip and the Midi-output.
There is although support for /dev/dmfm added, but the wrong device-number
is allocated (minor nr. 15), and
the functionality of it is not guaranteed. Furthermore the device is not
usable for standard music-player.
I know it is possible to address the FM-chip with /dev/sequencer (see
ALSA-drivers), but the current kernel-driver
does not support this.
