Subject: ext3+LVM - allocating block in system zone

	Hello,
	I've got lots of the following messaegs today:
EXT3-fs error (device lvm(58,0)): ext3_new_block: Allocating block in system zone - block = 205455454
EXT3-fs error (device lvm(58,0)): ext3_new_block: Allocating block in system zone - block = 205455455
EXT3-fs error (device lvm(58,0)): ext3_new_block: Allocating block in system zone - block = 205455456
EXT3-fs error (device lvm(58,0)): ext3_new_block: Allocating block in system zone - block = 205455457
EXT3-fs error (device lvm(58,0)): ext3_new_block: Allocating block in system zone - block = 205455461
	The system is newly-created LVM volume group with one LV (~820 GB)
Extent size is 32MB, LV has its extents interleaved across six PVs.
The ext3 filesystem is also newly created by the following command:
mke2fs -j /dev/data_vg/export_lv -m 0 -R stride=8192  -J size=256
	The problem appeared when I started to copy data to this
LV (about half an hour after the tar xvf - was started).
The problem also occurs on ext2. The kernel is 2.4.21-pre5 + the recent
ptrace() security patch. CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G is set, as well as CONFIG_HIGHIO.
The box has 1.2G RAM, disks are connected to on-board VIA 686a and PDC 20265
and one SIL/CMD 680 PCI IDE controllers. NIC is 3c985B (Tigon II), chipset
is VIA KT133. More information available on request.
	Is it a problem in kernel? Thanks,
-Y.
