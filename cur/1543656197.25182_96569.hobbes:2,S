After applying your three ext3 fixes to 2.4.20 and rebooting with
data=journal, I get the following message in dmesg which does not
appear with clean 2.4.20 (no matter whether data=ordered or
data=journal):
blk: queue c0370520, I/O limit 4095Mb (mask 0xffffffff)
It appears just after the messages for mounting my ext3 filesystems:
kjournald starting.  Commit interval 5 seconds
EXT3-fs: mounted filesystem with journal data mode.
VFS: Mounted root (ext3 filesystem) readonly.
Freeing unused kernel memory: 256k freed
EXT3 FS 2.4-0.9.19, 19 August 2002 on ide0(3,65), internal journal
kjournald starting.  Commit interval 5 seconds
EXT3 FS 2.4-0.9.19, 19 August 2002 on ide0(3,71), internal journal
EXT3-fs: mounted filesystem with journal data mode.
kjournald starting.  Commit interval 5 seconds
EXT3 FS 2.4-0.9.19, 19 August 2002 on ide0(3,69), internal journal
EXT3-fs: mounted filesystem with journal data mode.
kjournald starting.  Commit interval 5 seconds
EXT3 FS 2.4-0.9.19, 19 August 2002 on ide0(3,70), internal journal
EXT3-fs: mounted filesystem with journal data mode.
Is the message just for information or should I worry?
