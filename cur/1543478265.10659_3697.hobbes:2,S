Hello.
This is a bad patch for enabling "write allocation" on AMD K6 model 6,7 and
(maybe) K6-2 model 8. This stuff is in a wrong file, doesn't check CPU type
and needs some hand tuning. But I wish to know people's opinion about
performance with this patch.
*YOU SHOULD NOT APPLY THIS PATCH IF YOUR CPU IS NOT AMD K6 model 6 or 7!!!*
The number in line 
FIXME! movl $0x19, %eax
should not be 0x19. It should be <your memory size>/2 + 1.
I have 48 MB, so 48/2 + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 = 16 + 9 = 0x19.
(Do not forget to remove "FIXME!" :) )
If anybody find "write allocation" for K6 useful, I'll put all this code in
more appropriate place and will add support for K5 & K6-2. And will do a
lot of cosmetic changes.
It seems for me that overall system speed is up to 5-7%.
(make -j 8 zImage takes ~8:15 instead of ~8:50).
Patch is against 2.2.0pre7.
