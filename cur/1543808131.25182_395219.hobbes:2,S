thanks for the reply and sorry for the unclear question.
What i meant was when i do an "ls" in a directory that is part of the
ext2 filesystem, i can see a  "write" call in the strace output at the
end and it writes the directory contents to stdout. However when i
issue "ls" in the mount point of my file system, i dont have the
"write" call. The strace ends with the getdents64 call.
When i did some debugging i found that filldir which is suppose to
fill the dirent with the directory entries does its job. My filesystem
currently has only one inode with one block of data where i have a
".", ".." and "test" written into it.
The problem is it does not go further to do some of the other calls as
in a mountpoint in ext2 file system.
Hope i am clear now.
