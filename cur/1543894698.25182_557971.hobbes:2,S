    I don't really give a heck about that, because I will be using that
pendrive only in my system, but I think that pendrives are pretty common
nowadays, and using FAT with them is a waste. I don't like losing my
metadata just because I have to copy my data on a pendrive. So it's good
to see this filesystem mainstream'ed, it will be very good for small
distros (specially now that most of mobos allow booting from USB
sticks).
    A pity that my digital camera won't want to use LogFS :((
