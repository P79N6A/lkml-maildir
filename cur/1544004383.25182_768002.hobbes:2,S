Yes. I'm using the default formatting output in trace.c so perhaps
there is some iter flag I should dynamically remove
from the boot tracer to avoid that or perhaps I may format a custom
output for sched entries for the boot tracer.
I will see that....
By the way Arjan, does the actual state of the boot tracer match your needs?
You can find an example of its trace here:
