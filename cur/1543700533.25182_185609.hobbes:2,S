It'd be fantastic if we could get this implememted. I'm very pleased 
with the quality of this driver save for this one small issue.  I'd be 
glad to help test code if necessary as I have multiple systems using 
e1000's, and several are testboxes.  It'd be nice to have some 
semi-realtime stats from these cards.
