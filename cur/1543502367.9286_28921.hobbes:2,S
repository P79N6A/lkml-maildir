There was a previous thread about it and I remember that it has to do with
how block IO is *not* multiplexed..
RTLinux doesn't handle real-time IO. Real-time stream on Unix machine is
specialized topic that doesn't seem to be addressed in Linux nearly as
much as it has on SGI boxes. Even SGI boxes are rather slow with IO relative
to what I've seen under the BeOS.
