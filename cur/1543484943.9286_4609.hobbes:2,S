Hi,
iv`e found this thread in dejanews but it seems to be not complete.
i know the guy from the citing (wasp2.mpae.gwdg.de) i've got
the same machine and OS rev (Mot SysV R3.7 on MVME167) for development
at home.
with a 2.1.131 kernel i get the same symptoms: 
connect ok, login message ok
        login:_
and now no chars are accepted.
( since 2.0.33 there was always a slightly longer delay from starting
telnet to the message connected, must be parm. negotiation )
I did some testing with a .telnetrc setting some options.
the first thing i noticed  was LINEMODE beeing enabled instead of
CHARMODE as in 2.0.33 ) 
this and a couple of other tries made it possible to submit a "user" and
get the passwd line. but no more than that.
after i set "toggle options" in .telnetrc and getting 
the negotiation printed out everything worked fine.
Now the only necessary line is "toggle options"! hinting on 
a timing problem!?
if this is of any interrest i'd be happy to give more information.
please CC me as im not subscribed to this list.
