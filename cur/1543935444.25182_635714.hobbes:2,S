Another typical FOSS answer. "You have the source, you can fix it."

It doesn't, with the unpredictable SCSI mapping insanity.

Recompiling? No thanks. Compiling the Linux kernel is too painful.

And recompile and recompile and recompile ad infinitum, because always
some option was missing or wrong, there being far too many of them and
hidden all over the place.

See above on having time to learn over-cryptic systems.

I don't use a distro kernel. I use a kernel I compiled myself over
two years ago. I have tried compiling newer ones, but it's too much
work to get all the options right. And then there's the problem that
the "good" driver for my SATA disk may not be there anymore in the
latest kernels, and so on.
