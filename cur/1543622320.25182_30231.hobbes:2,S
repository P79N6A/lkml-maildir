Kernel geniuses:
I am using a Debian woody installation (3.0) with kernel 2.4.18-rc4 SMP. My root is mounted on an I2O device (Intel RAID SRCU-1). Whenever I run apt-get update, the process freezes and is completely unresponsive to any signal. When I do an strace, the fsync call is the last to appear, and it does not appear to successfully return. Is this an application, library or kernel issue? Once one application freezes, any other application that writes to the device (such as lilo) will freeze as well. Please help! Please CC any suggestions.
Thanks.
