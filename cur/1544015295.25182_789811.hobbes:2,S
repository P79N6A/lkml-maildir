| | Ok, I tested this in my L2TP setup. The first ppp session setup fails
| | because the PPPIOCNEWUNIT ioctl returns -EEXIST. I think the problem is
| |  the logic in ppp_create_interface(), which does the following to create
| | a new ppp interface:
| | 
| |         /* Initialize the new ppp unit */
| |         ppp->file.index = unit;
| |         sprintf(dev->name, "ppp%d", unit);
| | 
| |         ret = register_netdev(dev);
| | 
| | Looks like there is more work to do in the ppp changes.

Btw James did connection work without these patches? On
pure net-next-2.6 tree? I've some bad feeling that this
fail is related to different patch. Just to be sure.
