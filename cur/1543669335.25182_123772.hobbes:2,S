Matt, thanks for the pointers!
Looking at those sites, it appears that the development at
"
http://lists.insecure.org/lists/linux-kernel/2003/Feb/0987.html."
which I had pointed is based on the SGI's dump scheme. Same
for the one you pointed to.
The other scheme I poinited to (from Mission Critical Linux/MCLX)
seems to have some strong points too. Any pointers to discussions
about why the LKCD work seems to more active than the
MCLX one?
Best regards,
-Arun.
