I have done benchmark tests with Evolution under the following conditions: (times measured since the reply 
button is clicked until the message is opened) 
 
2.4.20-2.54 -> 9s 
2.5.63-mm1 w/Deadline -> 34s 
2.5.63-mm1 w/AS -> 33s 
 
The 2.4.20-2.54 is *not* a stock kernel, but Red Hat's own patched kernel (I think they include most of Alan Cox 
patches). Times are measured manually (don't know how to "time" the time elapsed since I click a button and 
the reply window is opened). Also, the filesystem is "ext2" running on a laptop (not a really fast hard disk).

Well, the aspell dictionary files are roughly 16MB for the Spanish dictionary and 4MB for the English one.
