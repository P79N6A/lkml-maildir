Hi, 
Do i understand this right?
Netdev watchdog can only be called when netif_stop_queue(...) has been
called. From what i gather in b44.c it's only called when the send queue
is full, yet it can trigger on a common dhcp request.
(where netif_queue_stopped(...) should return false, and thus the
watchdog shouldn't run at all)
As it is now, i can't understand how i can get watchdog timeouts since
the queue would have to be filled. On a 100mbit fdup link it shouldn't
delay that long not even if you use UDP packets (like nfs, I've even
seen it trigger with ftp now).
Anyways, Doing bio-timing based on the text output, it should work.
And, the current vanila kernel.org kernel doesn't work for me, as i have
stated numerous times and received no feedback.
PS, CC, not in list.
DS.
