Hi,
I have made a patch to fix problems with regards to early userspace 
calls (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/23/306
) but I don't think it will 
solve this bug. So far I had not heard of problems with filesystem 
initialization.
I'm not sure it would be possible to delay acpi_early_init() until after 
the fs initcalls. Maybe Len knows. How about trying the opposite: what 
is the barely minimum to initialize so that the rootfs can be populated 
and read? Would it be possible to have a kind of 
early_mnt_writer_initialize() that would do that?
See you,
Eric
