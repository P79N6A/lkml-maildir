Changes:
- updated to 2.6.8
- readded ucontext.h - originally thought glibc could handle that, but doesn't 
seem that way (newest hddtemp builds)
- readded unaligned.h (and cleaned it up) - reiserfsprogs' developers found a 
use for it in userland (newest reiserfsprogs builds)
- added and cleaned up (more or less) the sh64 arch
- tried to add missing arm subarch - needs testing I guess
- minor fixes (some ia64 and x86_64 userland conflicts)
This release should have been here a day or two ago weren't it for Murphy's 
laws (the machine that I use for llh development 'broke' yesterday... after 4 
months of uptime :).
Enjoy.
