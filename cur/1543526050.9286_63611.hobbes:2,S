Hi!
2.3.45 drops me out instantly after logging in.
This is on a RH6.1 machine, last shows my trying with 0:00
logn time after booting another kernel. Before that I used
2.3.43 and it does not show this problem.
(Maybe PAM has problems? But that is not a kernel question.)
Regards,
Zoltan Boszormenyi
