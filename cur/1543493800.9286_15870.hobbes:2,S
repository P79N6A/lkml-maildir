Hallo,
for some strange reason I had maked the SCSI-Disk as permanent part of 
the kernel and the SCSI Hardware (sym/ncr53c8xx in my case) driver as
a module. Relevant parts of my conf.module are:
alias scsi_hostadapter sym53c8xx
alias block-major-8       sd_mod
Trying to mount a MO disk in /dev/sda didn't result in the
Hardware driver getting loaded. Is this the right behaviour?
Should sd.c reassure that a Hardware driver is available and do a
request_module in case there isn't?
Bye
