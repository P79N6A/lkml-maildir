I like Pavel's suggestion.  It's simpler at the device driver level 
(unless you're working on the device-mapper driver!) and it can apply to 
situations other than unplug-during-suspend.
As for making the filesystem clean following a surprise unplug...  You can
if the device is plugged back in later and you recognize it as the same
device.

A new mount option, like "-o clean"?  Something that would flush data
writes immediately (like "sync") and would flush metadata writes whenever
a file is closed and other similar occasions?  People have been asking for 
something like this.  Mounting with "sync" is very bad for flash memory 
devices, and mounting without it messes up progress-bar displays in user 
programs.  Something in between would be appreciated.  Especially for the 
VFAT driver.
