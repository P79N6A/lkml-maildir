Well, you had some mistakes, but instead of correcting them, I suggest
you install 2.2.1 kernel and start from there. First thing you'll
notice is that all structures you were talking about are gone. For
good.
So it is probably waste of time to dig them further, cause 2.2.x
series introduce completely different mechanisms, and thus many new
things to explore, and spend time on.
Also, if you're interested in MM, I suggest you visit
	
http://humbolt.geo.uu.nl/Linux-MM/
and maybe subscribe to the linux-mm list (you'll find archives and
instructions there), where you can meet other people interested in
Memory Management system in Linux (and also developers of the system).
Regards,
