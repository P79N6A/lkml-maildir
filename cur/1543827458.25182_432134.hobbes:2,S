Did you look at the call sites?  It seems clear that kmemleak doesn't 
support existing kernel coding style yet (see below) which means we're not 
covering all false positives.

I found at least two unacceptable false positive classes:
  - arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:
    False positive because res pointer is stored in a global instance of
    struct resource.
  - drivers/base/platform.c and fs/ext3/dir.c:
    False positive because we allocate memory for struct + some extra
    stuff.
At least the latter can be fixed as outlined by Catalin in another mail.
