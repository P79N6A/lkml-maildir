That non one in tree ever uses it is a very good reason no to export it
either.  While there are still far too many direct jiffy users there
is no one directly convertin it to a timespec for good reason.

By that rationale everything errornously implemented as a macro or inline
at some point will need to be exported.  Except for you we still maintain
that we don't want to keep unused exports.  Arjan even put a formal mechanism
in to warn about them and has gotten a global buy-in to kill them.  This
will fall under this ASAP and only give people a short period to keep using
it.  Not a very useful message.
(especially when the only user is closed source crap where people should
help the proper reverse-engineered driver instead)
