Hello,
I'm trying to build a 2.6.22.1-rt9 kernel for a P3.
I used 'make xconfig' to create .config
http://linux.kernel.free.fr/latency/config-2.6.22.1-rt9-adlink
I get the following warning:
   LD      vmlinux
   SYSMAP  System.map
   SYSMAP  .tmp_System.map
   MODPOST vmlinux
WARNING: kernel/built-in.o(.text+0x19152): Section mismatch: reference

I also get the following warnings (which seem less severe)
   CC      drivers/pci/pci.o
   CC      drivers/pci/quirks.o
   CC      drivers/pci/pci-driver.o

   CC      drivers/pci/rom.o
Finally, I note that X86_CMPXCHG64 is no longer defined since its 
specification was changed between 2.6.20 and 2.6.22.
  config X86_CMPXCHG64
     bool
-   depends on !M386 && !M486
+   depends on X86_PAE
     default y
Will this have an impact on spinlocks? RCU? something else?
Regards.
