Hi Vivek,
Thank you for your feedback!

That was what my gut feel said at first, too. But...

... I noticed that the maximum theoretical delay you mention has to be
multiplied by the number of CPUs on big systems, because on those
machines send_IPI_mask is implemented as a series of unicasts to each
CPU. It is for this reason that I thought this approach may be
considered unacceptable (I have to admit that I have not performed any
micro-benchmarks, though).

Please notice that such high-precision timers are not available in all
machines.

As I mentioned above the performance overhead depends on several
factors. I hope it makes sense.
