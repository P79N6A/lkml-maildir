Ok.

I applied the following patch:

-       if (tty->driver.flags & TTY_DRIVER_RESET_TERMIOS)
+       if ((tty->driver.flags & TTY_DRIVER_RESET_TERMIOS) && tty->termios)
                *tty->termios = tty->driver.init_termios;
        if (tty->ldisc.num != ldiscs[N_TTY].num) {
                if (tty->ldisc.close)
After recompile & reboot in X, I tried to run the gcc testsuites
(which use a bunch of ptys) in parallel on two gcc trees , and I got a
solid lockup.
Rebooted, ran them on the console.
Got a really bad oops, the log was garbled, the only thing I could
note down was EIP, which translates to:
0xc01115d2 is in del_timer (sched.c:475).
470     static inline int detach_timer(struct timer_list *timer)
471     {
472             struct timer_list *prev = timer->prev;
473             if (prev) {
474                     struct timer_list *next = timer->next;
475                     prev->next = next;
476                     if (next)
477                             next->prev = prev;
478                     return 1;
479             }
...which is rather unusable.
Methinks there's still a problem, and just checking for tty->termios
to be non-null fixes one symptom. 
Are these 'dev (03:00) tty->count(0) != #fd's(2) in do_tty_hangup'
and 'null tty in fasync' really harmless ?
Phil.
