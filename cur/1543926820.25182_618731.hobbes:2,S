I was wrong originally, the issue is acctually occuring whenever I try
to write to a cd. With wodim or k3b, I am unable to write to the drive.
The error shown in dmesg is what happened when I tried to blank a disc.
In 2.6.23 it works instantly, with 2.6.24-rc4 it sits there, then there
are those errors, then I cannot eject the dvd from the drive. With k3b
it takes an age just to load and when it does it reports no media in the
drive, I am also unable to eject the media from the drive.
I can mount a standard dvd without issue in 2.6.24-rc3. It's just
writing that fails.
