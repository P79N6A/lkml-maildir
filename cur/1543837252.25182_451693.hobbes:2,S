I actually was arguing for VMI ROM to be built into kernel. You have
pretty strong arguments why it will not work, but Xen is doing that,
and it would be at least very interesting to see how it works for
vmware. (And perhaps to decide that it does not work :-).

Oh yes, it can be part of kernel build. #ifdef vmware_version_3_0_4 is
ugly, but at least it would force you not to change the interfaces too
often, which might be good thing.

Good, nice, so you are close. Now get us GPLed release ;-).
