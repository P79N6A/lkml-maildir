no ... if the kernel supports it, uClibc supports ... if the kernel
doesnt support, uClibc doesnt support it
adding a ghetto userspace implementation to workaround this is weak
... that'll just mean random bugs may crop up on us that dont exist
for any other architecture simply because we opted not to hook up the
common kernel version
either we support it and have the kernel pull in the common one or we
dont support ... no middle ground here
