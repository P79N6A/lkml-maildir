Normally a pci bus address, but its really a cookie

The same cookie

You need enable_device, and before you touch the others. That should
ensure the hardware is in D0 (active) not powersaving or some other
inconvenience
Basically the logic goes
Ask the pci layer for pci register values
Feed values to ioremap
Get a cookie for use with readb/readw/readl etc
The return of ioremap may be a physical mapping, it might be the
cpu view of the bus address, or something else.
