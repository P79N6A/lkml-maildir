It is possible, but it should be _extremely_ rare. The only cases where
tk_exit() sets a timer are the cases where we call rpc_delay(). In the
existing cases in the kernel, that would be setting timers of 5 seconds
(for the case of JUKEBOX errors) or longer.
These tx_exit()+restart events are very rare in themselves (JUKEBOX
errors only occur if the server needs to do something with a long
latency - such as retrieving a file from an HSM unit), but for that to
coincide with a preemption or interrupt of > 5 seconds inside
__rpc_execute... I'd hate to see those RPC performance figures.

Yes. I agree the scenario is theoretically possible (so I can queue that
patch up for you). I am not convinced it is a plausible explanation for
what John claims to be seeing, though.
