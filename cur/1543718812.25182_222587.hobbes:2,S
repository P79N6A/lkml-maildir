They're pretty low latencies you're talking about there.
You should be able to reduce the amount of work in that timer handler by
limiting the size of the per-cpu caches in the slab allocator.  You can do
that by writing a magic incantation to /proc/slabinfo or:

That work was focussed on the amount of work which is performed in a single
RCU callback, not in the slab timer handler.
