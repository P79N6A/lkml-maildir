Oh, I don't doubt there is a problem. I'm just asking if using the TSC
is really the only way to properly ding the process? 
I'm not a scheduler guy, so forgive my ignorance, but since the TSC may
not be available everywhere, might there be an alternative way to ding
the process? Surely something is keeping track of how many pagefaults a
process causes. Maybe a counter of how many times it has switched off
the cpu within the current tick? Couldn't these values be used as
scheduler weights?
I realize that ideally having super a fine grained notion of how much
cputime every process has had executing would be great. But it isn't
possible everywhere, so what can we do instead?

The problem is that some CPUs give you time, others give you work, and
sometimes those values are related. If you really want to re-define
sched_clock so that it gives you some vague work-unit instead of
nanoseconds, then that's fine, but it will need some additional
documentation and its likely you don't want to use the cycles_2_ns()
functions.
I don't really care too much about changes to sched_clock() as its
always been a special case interface just for the scheduler. I just want
it documented well enough so others don't think its a valid timekeeping
interface.

If you can guarantee that, then great! I know that was the original
intention, but some folks had problems with it which resulting in the
conditional #if NUMA code.

That's fine if its what you propose, I just didn't see it in your patch.
As it was written it would have broken NUMAQ and other systems that do
not have usable TSCs (ie: i386/i486).

Try re-spinning the patch to address the above issues and I'll happily
review it again. I just want to make sure the issue is addressed
properly and doesn't break other systems.
