OK, I think the problem is that can be more than one thread with different address 
spaces (ie different "current->mm", after fork) accessing the page.
Adding a waitqueue to "anon_vma" structure (to be slept at do_swap_page time, 
and awake after copy-page-and-flags/unlock), can be do the job I think.

Yes thats a nice idea.

touch_unmapped_address() ?

The thing is: What is the point of writing out pages?
We're just trying to migrate pages to another zone. 
If its under writeout, wait, if its dirty, just move it to the other
zone.
Can you enlight me?

Any news about Iwamoto's test programs? :)
