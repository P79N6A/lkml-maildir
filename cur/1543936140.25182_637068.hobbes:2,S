Thanks very much for that - I was debugging this for a while too, and
eventually just shut off hwclock.

I beg to differ.  I managed to turn the thing into a brick by upgrading
the BIOS (with the correct image, no less) in an attempt to fix it.  I
just got it back from repair.  I'm not sure that is positive
evolutionary development, but it certainly does make my laptop an
aberration :)
FWIW, I fixed the problem locally by recompiling, changing port 80 to
port 84 in io.h; works great, and doesn't conflict with any occupied
ports.
