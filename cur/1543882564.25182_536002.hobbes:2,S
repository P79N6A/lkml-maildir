John,
You are correct, you need patch 3/3 for it to compile and run.
I did a patch to the orginal patch, thought that was correct thing to do.
But I can make a new patch 1 from the orginal of ours and my #3.
I would also make an update to the #2 patch from #3 for ntp correct change.
That would be just 2 patches then, the enable_ia64 and remove_interpolater.
What do you think?
