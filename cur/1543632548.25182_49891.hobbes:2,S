Hello,
One of my workmates created a >2Gb file on a MS-Windows server. That works
perfectly.  He exported the partition and looked at it from another
MS-Windows machine, where he can see the right size.  But when we look
at the file from a linux machine, the reported size is plain wrong (it
is actually the real size on 32-bit, extended to 64 bit as a signed 32 bit
value, thus prefixed with 0xffffffff, and then printed as an unsigned 64 bit
value.).  Not only does `ls -l' not work, but other accesses to the file are
also impossible.
Here is a fix (tested on 2.2.16 and 2.4.18) :

Is it possible to incorporate that in the official linux kernel tree ?
Thanks in advance
