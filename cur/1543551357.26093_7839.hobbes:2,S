Linux does support 64G of physical memory. My machine has 6G RAM and runs
absolutely nice and smooth as it should. Everything "just works" (ok, not
counting a few subtle cache-related issues and stability of PCI subsystem
but those happened many hours ago and were quickly fixed so they are
history now and therefore long forgotten ;).
As for PAE, yes it does incur penalty of about 3-6% of performance
"overall". By overall performance I meant the unixbench numbers. I have
published the numbers comparing PAE/4G/nohighmem kernels on the same
machine sometime ago...
So, it only makes sense to enable PAE if you have more than 4G of memory.
