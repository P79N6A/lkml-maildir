Funny thing: Assuming this was an ext3 problem, I moved the data to a reiserfs 
partition (with so many files, performance is an issue anyway) since the box 
is pretty critical.  I'll try to sneak some downtime in to try this out, but 
I can't make any promises...  The problem should be fairly easy to replicate 
in a lab though, if you're interested.
