FYI I had to use hda=cyls,255,63 to repartition my HDD. BIOS refused
to report proper size (120GB) when partition table was empty, or when
it contained partitions created for xxx/16/63 geometry. It reported
size ~600MB, and actively refused to allow access above this limit...
With removed (either completely, or just disabling as it is now) xlate_1024 
code please talk to [cs]fdisk maintainer (and other) to print big fat
warning and to allow specify BIOS heads/sectors, otherwise partitioning
of empty disk in the way compatible with non-Linux OSes (Netware, Windows)
is not an easy task.
