That is quite nice - ask user at install time whether to remove the
disk manager.
However, after doing that it seems appropriate for a booting kernel to
autodetect the presence or absence of the disk manager and behave
accordingly.
Just like the user gets to choose what goes in the partition table at
install time, and after that it is read automatically.
The user does not (usually) have to supply special kernel options to
tell it where the partitions are, or what the disk geometry is.  The
kernel can do that automatically.  So why does this not apply to known
disk manager remappings?
