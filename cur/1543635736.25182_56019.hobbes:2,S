   Could you make the counters per-cpu and only add them all up
   in the rare case where someone wants to read the stats?
   And then change all the drivers ;)
Since spinlocks are held %99 of the time when these counters are
bumped, I'd like to suggest another more sane and space optimized
solution :-)
