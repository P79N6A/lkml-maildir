I'm speaking as the vger.kernel.org list maintainer.
Posting job offerings here has always been and will always be verboten
here on these lists.  And in particular technical people who join this
list get a very bad taste in their mouth when someone advertises here
be it for jobs or products.
If there is no good place to look for Linux kernel development jobs,
that isn't my problem.  What is my problem is to enforce the rules
of these lists at vger.kernel.org.
