Yeah, I guess disabling clflush and calling wbinvd and a full TLB flush
on every CPU is the safe way to go.
However, digging in your previous patch (in Andrew's tree), I think I
found a potential cause for the problem:
__change_page_attr does a list_add of &kpte_page->lru. If I am not
mistaken, there can be more than one consecutive struct page *page
having their PTE in the same kpte_page. Therefore, it would generate
many list_add of the same kpte_page, which would cause a loop in the
linked list, and therefore a system hang.
Does it make sense ?
