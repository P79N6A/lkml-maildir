As suspected by Russell, the badness seems to happen just at the
end of the serial_inp on LSR, drivers/serial/8250.c:1650.
The NULL deref happens at the beginning of the serial_inp(up, UART_RX)
call, when trying to dereference *up.
c01bfa70 <serial_in>:
c01bfa70:       55                      push   %ebp
c01bfa71:       89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp
c01bfa73:       53                      push   %ebx
c01bfa74:       8b 5d 08                mov    0x8(%ebp),%ebx << %ebx = up (which is NULL)
c01bfa77:       8b 55 0c                mov    0xc(%ebp),%edx
c01bfa7a:       0f b6 4b 12             movzbl 0x12(%ebx),%ecx << %ecx = *(%ebx+12) Oops
c01bfa7e:       0f b6 43 13             movzbl 0x13(%ebx),%eax
It seems that somehow, the pop %ebx at the end of
the serial_inp(up, UART_LSR) function poped a NULL value instead of the
expected pointer. Any suggestion on how this could happen?
Jose, did you try to msleep(10) before the "And clear the interrupt
registers again for luck." as suggested by Russell?
You should also revert the change I suggested, it seems I missed the
target by a few lines of code :).
Regards,
Frederik
