also, i improved that stackdump in the U4/U5 patches (PREEMPT_TRACE) to
include a trace of critical sections held at that moment:
  [<c0169dcb>] sys_unlink+0xdc/0x129
  [<c01060b5>] sysenter_past_esp+0x52/0x71
 preempt count: 00000002
 . 2-level deep critical section nesting:
 .. entry 1: free_hot_cold_page+0x82/0x149 / (__pagevec_free+0x1f/0x28)
 .. entry 2: print_traces+0x1b/0x54 / (dump_stack+0x23/0x25)
While the stackdump indeed is supposed to clearly identify the critical
section, they can be quite large and opaque, sometimes they even lose
the information of where the lock was acquired, and in practice it's
much easier to use PREEMPT_TRACE.
