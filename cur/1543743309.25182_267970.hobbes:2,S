I am writting an application that needs control over large (1gig+)
portions of contiguous memory. I am currently doing this by using
mem=1024m during boot. My system is a dual opteron with 5 gig of
memory. In my program I have
if ((fd=open("/dev/mem", O_RDWR))<0)
{
perror("open");
exit(-1);
}
PtrMemoryBase = (void *) mmap64(
NULL,
size,
PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,
MAP_FILE | MAP_SHARED,
fd,
base );
size = 1MB
I also have -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64.
If base is between 1 and 3 gig the process works fine. When base is 4
gig + the mmap64 works but the memory does not seem to be mapped to
the base location. I write a pattern to PtrMemoryBase then have my
hardware start doing DMA transfers from the base address but I do not
get the data I wrote to PtrMemoryBase.
Thanks for any help
Mark
