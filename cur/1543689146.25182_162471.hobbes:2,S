Is it worth having a kernel config option to vary the number of 'pdflush'
kernel threads?
For embedded, systems with no swap and maybe uniproc (?), perhaps one
pdflush kthread would do?
Perhaps more generally, the number could be linked to the number of
processors and/or swap devices or spindles- this would eliminate having to configure
it, and improve downward and upward scaling, perhaps?
