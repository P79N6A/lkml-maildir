Hi,
	The KT400 agp ids were submitted (and included with a few bits you
missed) around 2.4.20-rc4 time. Like Dave Jones wrote, they are suitable
only for agp2 cards ATM (I get a agp3 question in my mailbox every week
or so). They are far from useless, lots of people have agp2 cards.
	If you want to do everyone a favor, post a patch to document
CONFIG_AGP_VIA is agp2 only on 2.4 right now. (If you don't I might do
it one day if only to spare Dave Jones and me a few mails until 2.5 agp3
support is backported)
	Regards,
