On 2.6.22.5-v20.3 (not v20.4):
340-    curr->delta_exec += delta_exec;
341-
342-    if (unlikely(curr->delta_exec > sysctl_sched_stat_granularity)) {
343://          __update_curr(cfs_rq, curr);
344-            curr->delta_exec = 0;
345-    }
346-    curr->exec_start = rq_of(cfs_rq)->clock;

The 3x gears test shows the startup problem in a really noticeable way.  With 
v20.4 they startup surging and stalling periodically for about 10sec, then 
they are smooth.  With v20.3 + above patch they startup completely smooth.
Thanks!
