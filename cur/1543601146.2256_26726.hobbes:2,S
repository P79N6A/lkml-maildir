Well, the "best" way of running e2fsck is with the "-p" option, so that it
will pick y/n as appropriate.  In almost all cases "-p" and "-y" behave
the same, but in a few rare cases they do not.
In general, if you are manually fsck'ing a filesystem, it is better to
run fsck.<fstype> directly (and read its man page) instead of the "fsck"
wrapper program.
In some rare cases, fsck cannot decide what is the right thing to do, so
you need to run it in manual mode, which appears to be what happened to you.
Cheers, Andreas
