There's no way the scheduler can figure out the scheduling and memory
use patterns of the new tasks in advance.
but userspace could give hints - e.g. a syscall that triggers a
rebalancing: sys_sched_load_balance(). This way userspace notifies the
scheduler that it is on 'zero ground' and that the scheduler can move it
to the least loaded cpu/node.
a variant of this is already possible, userspace can use setaffinity to
load-balance manually - but sched_load_balance() would be automatic.
