Actually, it's already called from other places ... :)
/sbin/hotplug is called from the init.d/hotplug startup script.
There's a period during initial system boot when not all filesystems
or system services are available.  When the kernel calls out to
/sbin/hotplug in such a situation, hotplugging can't yet do it's job.
It's too early, the system isn't "hot" yet ... which is why I call this
problem the "coldplug" issue.   Even simple device setup
operations like modprobing may not be possible, much less
more complex ones like alerting/starting daemons.  So the
init.d/hotplug script, invoked later, fakes hotplug events to
make sure the same setup gets done, without requiring users
to unplug/replug devices.
