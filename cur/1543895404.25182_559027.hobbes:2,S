The kernel uses always_inline (as of today), so I'd expect we do know
a function explicitly marked such would be inlined. But yes, if that
inline (or kernel's use of always_inline) is dropped from the code in
future, then we would need to add the __init at that time anyway,
so as long as gcc is doing the right thing given both inline and section,
we might introduce the __init now too as you suggest. [Might also help
readability / uniformity as Paul mentioned.]

Well, in-kernel, "inline __init" expands to (currently):
inline __attribute__((always_inline)) __attribute__((__section__(".init.text")))
which is weird, if not crazy, to say the least. So I'm not sure we can
find fault with gcc (regardless of what it does) given such usage :-)

Hmm, this is a bit orthogonal, and I have no strong opinion regarding
the kernel's use of always_inline itself. Those who don't like gcc
rewriting their code would want it to stay but forcing it for all cases
(by redefining a keyword as a macro) isn't best either. Perhaps "inline"
could be left alone by removing the always_inline, and "__always_inline"
used explicitly where we _really_ want stuff to be inlined. But then what
might happen is that everybody would think his particular use of inline
is correct and beneficial and all users of inline in kernel would end up
as __always_inline anyway. Given this, the best way to deal with
kernel bloat due to inlining appears to be to remove the inline marker
from stuff that shouldn't/needn't be inline in the first place, instead of
changing the kernel's default use of always_inline, IMO.
