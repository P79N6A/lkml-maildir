Hello Ed!
I would delete the paragraph below, because we should not talk about
"threat to Microsoft". Many companies use Microsoft and the feel somehow
uncomfortable to support something that renders their investments
useless.
They should have the impression that Linux adds value to their company,
makes things easier, more stable and saves money. They should not have
the impression that all they know is obsolete and they did the wrong
thing.
