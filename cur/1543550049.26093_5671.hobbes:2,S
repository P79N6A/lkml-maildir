Thanks.  Patch looks OK.  I'll fix a couple of error-path memleaks in
init_module() which just jumped out at me, test it and then forward to
jgarzik for inclusion in his next driver drop.  This will (hopefully) be
post-2.4.0.

That sounds useful, but remember that once test9 comes out, Linus is
only accepting things which are critical bugfixes or which are on the
TODO list.  So you may care to batch this stuff up for after 2.4.0.
If you find something critical then I'd suggest you submit that and not
include any of the whitespace readjustments - that'll increase the
chances of the patch making it to kernel.org.
