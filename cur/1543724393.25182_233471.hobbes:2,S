Known problem, but a fix is not trivial since the unlink() procedure
does not take a nameidata structure argument (which would be needed in
order to figure out which vfs_mount struct to mntget()).
If someone can figure out a way to fix it, then a patch would be
welcome, but I'm on holiday until the Linux Kernel Summit starts, so
don't expect any immediate action from me...
Cheers,
 Trond
