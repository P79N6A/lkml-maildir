I'm a long time Linux and cdrecord user, and I must say I always hated
the -scanbus thingy. It's so much easier to just pass the /dev/hdc
device node, where I _know_ my CD burner lives than to have to figure
out what fake SCSI address cdrecord has made up and requires me to pass
to it, even when I have just a single CD burner in my system.
