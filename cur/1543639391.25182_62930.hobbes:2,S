Err... Well my original point about your changes to the sunrpc code
still stand: no spinlocking there AFAICS. In addition, you'll want to
talk to the Intermezzo people: they do allocation of buffers based on
the (volatile) value of cred->ngroups.
Finally, you also want all those reads and changes to more than one
value in the credential such as the stuff in security/capability.c, or
net/socket.c,... to be atomic. (Note: This is where 'struct ucred'
with COW gives you an efficiency gain).
Please also note that you only need spinlocking for the particular
case of tasks that have set CLONE_CRED. In all other cases, it adds a
rather nasty overhead...
Cheers,
  Trond
