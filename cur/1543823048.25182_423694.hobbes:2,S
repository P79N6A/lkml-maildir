That has been done already. One is kstrdup() from <linux/string.h>
implementation in mm/util.c . So duplication can go.
parse_num32 is implemented as memparse() from 
<linux/kernel.h> already, code is in lib/cmdline.c
It only misses the SI prefix stuff (kiBi and such).
Maybe SI units could be added to memparse() in
lib/cmdline.c and all those reimplementations ripped of drivers/mtd/*/* ?

Agreed stronly! It is also against Documentation/CodingStyle, Chapter 11
No worries, error handling always clutters up our nice code. 
The only accepted way around this in Linux is "goto error_label", 
so we can see the algorithm and read up on error handling at the 
end of a function, after the algorithm.
