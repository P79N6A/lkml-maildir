Well, reengineering nvidia/ati DRM is rude to ati/nvidia, so was creating
tigon3, so was rewriting from scratch the GPL drivers some ATA vendors
published in the past, so was spurning the SATA/SAS stack adaptec
offered...
Does politeness extend to accepting some devices will never see in-tree
drivers because someone wrote a GPL out-of-tree driver first (and refuses
to push it)? People are more squeamish about using an out-of-tree driver
as reference instead of leaked specs or rev-engeneered windows drivers
(despite out-of-tree drivers being under the GPL ie with authorisation do
do whatever people want with the code).
If the answer is no, then there is a big pile of device documentation (in
the form of source code) waiting to be used.
