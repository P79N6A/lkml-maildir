It's not single-user. Quoth the Daemon Book:
>>>Security levels are defined as follows:
-1. Permanently insecure mode: Always run system in level 0 mode (must be
compiled into the kernel).
0. Insecure mode: Immutable and append-only flags may be turned off. All
devices can be read or written, subject to their permissions.
1. Secure mode: The superuser-settable immutable and append-only flags cannot
be cleared; disks for mounted filesystems and kernel memory (/dev/mem and
/dev/kmem) are read-only.
2. Highly secure mode: This mode is the same as secure mode, except that
disks are always read-only whether mounted or not. This level precludes
even a superuser from tampering with filesystems by unmounting them, but
also inhibits formatting of new filesystems.
Normally the system runs with level 0 security while in single-user mode,
and with level 1 security while in multiuser mode. If level 2 security is
desired while the system is running in multiuser mode, it should be set in
/etc/rc startup script<<<
superuser-settable flags are not supported in Linux right now. The idea
being: there are two immutable flags - user and root. For VFS they are the
same (i.e. presense of any makes file immutable). user flag can be
set/reset by owner of file and by root. root flag can be changed *only* by
root and only if securelevel < 1. In other words, immutable is available
for users, but root can additionally set stronger variant that can't be 
revoked without rebooting into insecure mode. The same goes for
append-only. *Good* idea, but unfortunately ext2 doesn't support it.

It is not a security through obscurity. It doesn't close all holes (as any
other measure), but it's a useful additional tool.
