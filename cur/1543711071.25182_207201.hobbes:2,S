Hi,
 I am new to linux world and this mailing list.
 I need to use the arithmetic functions like sin, cos,
exp, log, etc in linux device driver.
 On search read , not to use libm from kernel driver
as it will harm the fpu registers.
  Do you have any insight how to support these
functions in linux driver or any code that is
available which I can make use of?
thanks
vinod
