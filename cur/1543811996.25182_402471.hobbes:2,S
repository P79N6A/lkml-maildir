They did not trigger for me, altrough my own traps do.

This is one I'm hitting. Actually I'm hitting my own check few lines
down:
        if (!state->info)
                printk(KERN_CRIT "no state->info\n");
        else uart_circ_clear(&state->info->xmit);
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&port->lock, flags);
        tty_wakeup(tty);
... simply not doing uart_circ_clear() at all makes system
survive... so this could be made into WARN()...
