Hi all,
David Woodhouse has been *very* kind enough to provide git repository
for the battery stuff I've posted recently.
Much thanks, David!
To not confuse with David own battery-2.6 repository, it's called
battery2-2.6, and can be found here:
http://git.infradead.org/?p=users/cbou/battery2-2.6.git;a=summary
You can get it using "git clone --reference linux-2.6 \
git://git.infradead.org/users/cbou/battery2-2.6.git" command.
Now anyone interested can track changes and/or improve it.
As time will permit I'll port Apple PMU and OLPC drivers to new
battery class.
Good luck,
--
