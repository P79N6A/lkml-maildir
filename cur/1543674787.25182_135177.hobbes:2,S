A quick grep of the current source tree seems to indicate that there aren't
any uses of 'strncpy' that actually save or check the return value.
As such, actually *using*  the return value would make for a job for the
kernel janitors, to actually do something useful at all 650 or so uses.
Given that the kernel probably *shouldn't* be trying to strlcpy() into
a destination that it won't fit, it may be more useful to do a BUG_ON()
or similar (feel free to use a 'goto too_long;' if you prefer ;)
