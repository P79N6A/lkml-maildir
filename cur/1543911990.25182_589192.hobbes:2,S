Subject: [PATCH] Remove valueless definition of hard-selected RAMFS option.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/28/3

Since CONFIG_RAMFS is currently hard-selected to "y", and since
Documentation/filesystems/ramfs-rootfs-initramfs.txt reads as follows:
"The amount of code required to implement ramfs is tiny, because all
the work is done by the existing Linux caching infrastructure.
Basically, you're mounting the disk cache as a filesystem.  Because of
this, ramfs is not an optional component removable via menuconfig,
since there would be negligible space savings."
it seems pointless to leave this as a Kconfig entry.
Signed-off-by: Robert P. J. Day <rpjday@mindspring.com>

  this also allows almost 300 "CONFIG_RAMFS=y" lines to be dropped
from various defconfig files.  and that horribly misleading Kconfig
help text disappears as well.  :-)
  compile tested under i386.

-	  Ramfs is a file system which keeps all files in RAM. It allows
-	  read and write access.
-
-	  It is more of an programming example than a useable file system.  If
-	  you need a file system which lives in RAM with limit checking use
-	  tmpfs.

-	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be called
