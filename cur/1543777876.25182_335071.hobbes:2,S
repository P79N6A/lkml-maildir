Ick, when I did this originally it was a hack, and it's still a hack.
It's sad to see it spreading around, but that's proably my fault...
Anyway, what are your plans for after this?  How long will this code
stay around?  What do you want to do next?
I don't have any real objections to this patch series at all, just very
curious as to your proposed roadmap after this.
thanks,
