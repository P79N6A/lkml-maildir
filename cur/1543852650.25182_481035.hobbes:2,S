Subject: [PATCH] x86_64: fix perms/range of vsyscall vma in /proc/*/maps
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi, Andy.  The final line of /proc/<pid>/maps on x86_64 for native 64-bit
tasks shows an incorrect ending address and incorrect permissions.  There
is only a single page mapped in this vsyscall region, and it is accessible
for both read and execute.
The patch below fixes this.  (Since 32-bit-compat tasks have a real vma
with correct perms/range, no change is necessary for that scenario.)
Before the patch, a "cat /proc/self/maps | tail -1" shows this:
	ffffffffff600000-ffffffffffe00000 ---p 00000000 [...]
After the patch, this is the output:
	ffffffffff600000-ffffffffff601000 r-xp 00000000 [...]
Cheers.  -ernie
