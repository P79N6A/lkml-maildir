Christoph has an interesting point. Networking is
	net/[protocol]/
	drivers/net/[driver]
so by that logic we'd have
	sound/soundcore.c
	sound/alsa/alsalibcode
	sound/oss/osscore
	sound/drivers/cardfoo.c
which would also be much cleaner since the supporting crap would be seperate
from the card drivers
