Will do.  I'll send out a new version of the patch in a separate note.

Most likely you are correct assuming that the BIOS turns the devices
off before starting GRUB.  Need to investigate...

I did not check this, but a quick look at the 600E's DSDT revealed
that powering up a device and its _STA status are not correlated,
at least on this machine.

ACK.

ACK.  But will not tackle this any time soon.

I find this asymmetry weird, too.  Maybe we could register when
the device is enabled and unregister when it is disabled?

Now I understand.  I'm giving in! :-D
