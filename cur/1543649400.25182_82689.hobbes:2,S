This is not my call actually. But beside comparing actual performance
between AIO and sys_epoll, one of the advantages that the patch had is
this :
arch/i386/kernel/entry.S  |    4
drivers/char/Makefile     |    4
fs/Makefile               |    4
fs/file_table.c           |    4
fs/pipe.c                 |   36 +
include/asm-i386/poll.h   |    1
include/asm-i386/unistd.h |    3
include/linux/fs.h        |    4
include/linux/list.h      |    5
include/linux/pipe_fs_i.h |    4
include/linux/sys.h       |    2
include/net/sock.h        |   10
net/ipv4/tcp.c            |    4
That is, it has a very little "intrusion" in the original code by plugging
in the existing architecture.
