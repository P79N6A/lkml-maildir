If it has legal value in showing the work is derivative thats not an
additional restriction. Its merely showing the intent of the author. If 
someone creates a work and its found to be derivative and they didnt
make it GPL compatible they get sued, thats also not an additional
restriction its what the GPL says anyway.
That is the whole point of EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL, it doesn't enforce
anything and Linus was absolutely specific it should not do the
enforcing. Its a hint and a support filter.
