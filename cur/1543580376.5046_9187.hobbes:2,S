Because of the loss of state bug with Cyclone, and the "missing" acpi_wake
workaround, right?

Of course it is a bug-fix!  I'm very bugged by the current behaviour!
Doesn't that count? :-)
Ugh.  Is the 2.2 driver more advanced than the 2.4 one?  Only temporary, I
hope... :-)
But alas, I cannot easily test this patch, since I need 2.4 for my ATA100
IDE controller, but please send me a patch for 2.4 as soon as you have
one, and I'll help you test it.
Would it be enough to port the acpi_wake function to 2.4?  If so, I can do
that myself.  In fact, I think I'll try that right away.  Who needs
breakfast anyway? :-)
