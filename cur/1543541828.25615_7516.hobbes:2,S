Maybe for NeXT-style Apps, which use just a standard Unix directory and no  
forks. Or maybe for Carbon apps. Remember that MacOS X hosts three very  
different kinds of applications.
Those are:
1. Traditional MacOS, inside a tradMacOS-emulator a.k.a. "blue box"
2. Slightly updated API *without* emulator, "Carbon".
3. NeXT-style apps.
I know 1 needs real MacOS forks, 3 needs no forks at all, no idea what 2  
does. Default filesystem for MacOS X is supposed to be HFS+, which has  
real forks.
If anybody knows for sure (that is, has seen an actual MacOS X machine and  
has investigated these things), I'd like to hear. But I'm sceptical about  
rumours.

On MacOS, 32 bit/4 char resource type, 16 bit resource number, optional  
255 character resource name, resource data. Those really are fully generic  
- parts of te OS know about specific types and numbers, but the Resource  
Manager doesn't care.
I suppose '\0\0\0\0' resource types might be ugly. That depends on how the  
interface gets implemented.
