I'm a little confused and very interested.  I have an SMP system with
IDE.  I'm not going to do RAID.  Is there known to be a problem with
SMP+IDE without RAID (I had thought so)?  Has it been fixed?
I was going to use Red Hat 6.1 (2.2.12 + some RH patches), but had
been scared off.  Is this version thought to be SMP+IDE safe?  If not,
what is?
Thanks,
