Sorry for the long message, but I'm working on an extension of the linux 
capabilities to support fine-grained capabilities to access specified files
and I need your opinion.
Using the current implementation, if a program is setuid root only because 
it needs to override some file permission problems, we give it 
CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE instead of giving it ALL roots capabilities
(eventually, only for a short period of time).
That's good, but if we run unmodified setuid0 applications, most of them
need CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE (eg. to write on /var/utmp, /etc/shadow, etc.).
However, a setuid0 application with CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE is still very dangerous,
because an attacker that breaks such an application can become root, for 
example adding a new entry in /etc/passwd, even if the setuid0 application
is running with euid = nobody.
One solution is to add a 'sandbox user' for the application instead of using
CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE, but this can probably work well only if we have ACLs and
it is still hard to track what a setuid0 application can do.
PROPOSED SOLUTION: to enforce least privilege explicitly specifying files 
for which the standard access control should be overriden, along with the
required access mask.
I can explain with an example. Suppose that you have an application myapp
that needs write permission on a file owned by root with access mask 000,
eg. /etc/myapp.conf. You want to create a "safe setuid0", so that every user
can run myapp.
I have modified Pavel Machek's elf capabilities hack 
(
http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~pavel/elfcap.html
) so that you can write
(as root):
#> chmod u+s myapp
#> setcap -u nobody -c FILE_ACCESS:/etc/myapp.conf:w  myapp
that means: myapp is a setuid that will run with euid = nobody and that 
has write access to /etc/myapp.conf.
IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
The list of files corresponding to the CAP_FILE_ACCESS (new) capability is
stored in the elf header. When myapp is executed, the kernel associates
a list of entries (inode_number, rdev, mask) to the corresponding process.
For this reason, I have extended task_struct. (inode_number, rdev) are
used to identify the file and are determined using the paths stored in 
the elf header.
The file access control is performed as follows:
permission(inode, mask):
- if inode can be accessed with normal UNIX access control, then it's OK;
- otherwise, go through the list of file capabilities of the current process
and find an entry corresponding to inode, and check access according to
the corresponding mask;
Thanks in advance for your comments.
