Hi,
My point is:
We don't know the parent structure. We shouldn't know it, since it takes
time. So I try to keep the address pointer stable instead of just
exchanging pointers.
That's why I'm exchanging pointers, and that's also why slist_del()
currently returns a value: because the deleted list entry would otherwise
be lost in space...
If any applicator needs to know a list header (primer), he shall produce
one and pass the first entry after the primer. We should only depend on
one single facility: the next field of the handled structure.
Also notice that we can restart list_for_each*() from any position.
