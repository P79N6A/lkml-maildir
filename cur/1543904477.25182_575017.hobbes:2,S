It was the only place where we stacked (had a hierarchy of) class
devices. We got a class device being a child of another class device.
We never did anything like that and it was the reason to go for a
unified tree at /sys/devices/ instead of putting small hierarchy trees
all over the place, which can never be changed later, as they are the
defined entry points into the device tree.
