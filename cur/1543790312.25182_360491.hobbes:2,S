That's a hang from the graphics developers point of view, your
graphics card has crashed and X is spinning waiting for the card to
come back and say it is okay.. something it never does...

I probably restart X about 5-10 times per working session and I've
never seen this yet, I'll do a few more reboots, we have a known issue
with a bug fix that went into X and I'm not sure if it is in your X
packages but it probably is.. can you tell me the FC4 xorg rpm titles
so I can check it, if it causing problems on AGP systems as well I'll
be pushing RH to release new X packages with a proper fix, that benh
is working on at the moment..
Dave.
