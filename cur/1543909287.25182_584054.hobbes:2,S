Yes, but ZONE_DMA32 == ZONE_DMA.
Also when the slab users of GFP_DMA are all gone ia64 won't need
the slab support anymore. So either you change your ifdef in slub or 
switch to ZONE_DMA32 for IA64.
The trouble is that this cannot be done globally, at least not
until s390 and a few other architures using GFP_DMA with slab
are all converted.

But it's not quite the same: GFP_DMA32 has no explicit slab support.
