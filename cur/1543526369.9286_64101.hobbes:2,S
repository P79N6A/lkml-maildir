After the discussions about the microcode driver and how it should be
available to everyone because of the 386 being generic condition, I made
these two patches.  The second one is incremental.
The idea is to define CONFIG_MX86_GENERIC for those wishing to configure
for all machines.  Then the specific processors can be changed to only
produce kernels for that specific processor.  For example, the 386 option
gives MTRR and 686 microcode upload options currently.  With this patch, it
can be given appropriate CPU classes.  Also, the high memory options could
be restricted to just 686+ because I'm sure my lowly Pentium can't do it.
Also, 386's probably don't have an IO-APIC available. This would also allow
the spin_unlock optimization that is currently commented out because
Pentium Pro's have a problem with it.
Anyway, I haven't written help entries on these or adjusted the
dependencies as mentioned above yet.  I'd like opinions first.
Patch against 2.3.46:

The options marked 'require' above currently panic() if you don't really
have it.  I didn't see one for the AMD 3D Now!, but I assume it'll Oops.
The above customization in the second patch would be handy for things like
the F00F bug where you have varying non-Pentium or the spin_unlock
optimization where people could pick it for generic kernels if they don't
have early PPro machines.  The goal is smaller, faster, and more specific
while maintaining the usefulness of the generic kernel.
[Tested config, menuconfig, and oldconfig.]
