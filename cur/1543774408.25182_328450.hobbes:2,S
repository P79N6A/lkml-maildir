Sure, we do it, but then we try to make it obvious to all sides.
It's the "small and non-obvious" differences that are really poisonous. 
You don't see them in the soruces, yet patches don't apply.
So don't do subtle whitespace "fixups" by default. It just makes everybody
unhappy down the line.
That's not to say that we don't do whitespace fixups _occasionally_. When 
it's ugly enough to be noticeable, I sure as hell fix up whitespace. But 
not by default.
