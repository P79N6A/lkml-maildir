Hi all,
I am facing a kernel bug[1] that completely crashes my machines. During
the last days I tried to fine tune the problem and I am now inclined for
a bug in libata/sata_sil or device mapper code.
I activated the DEBUG messages in raid5 source module, but I cannot find
a way to do the same with libata. Is there any #define I may use?
Thanks,
Giuseppe
