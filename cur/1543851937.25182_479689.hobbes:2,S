Not currently, no.  SELinux typically applies its MAC checks after any
DAC checks have already been applied, and will only further restrict
access.  Hence, you can use SELinux to limit what a process with
capabilities can do, since it must also have the corresponding SELinux
permissions, but you still need a way of gaining those capabilities in
order to pass the usual Linux checks.
Using SELinux to authoritatively grant capabilities based on role/domain
would be useful, and has been done by some people (via custom kernels),
but doing so safely requires quite a bit of work in userspace and policy
configuration.  That wasn't viewed as practical for an initial
deployment of MAC, and we didn't want to expose systems to greater risk.
