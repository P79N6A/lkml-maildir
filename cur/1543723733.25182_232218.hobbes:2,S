No, it's very unuseful. Probably it can't lookup, and it has possible
of filesystem corruption if you write.
If you want to do it, just read/write the partition directly.

You configured these, so fatfs will try to use it.

But you didn't install these. So fatfs couldn't do what you specified,
then fatfs logged it and returns error.
Looks like you want to the following config.
CONFIG_FAT_DEFAULT_CODEPAGE=850
CONFIG_FAT_DEFAULT_IOCHARSET="iso8859-15"
