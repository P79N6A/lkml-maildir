As someone else mentioned, it is probably hyper threading.  Run 'top'
and see if you get per cpu stats.  If it is hyperthreading, you should
be able to disable it in the BIOS.
IMO, hyperthreading is evil on an SMP box.  The system doesn't know
that not all CPUs are not created equal, and so if you have 4 CPU
intensive processes, then you have a good chance that 2 of the
processes will run at a reduced rate on the same CPU and one (or 2)
CPUs stay mostly idle...  All my benchmarks gave lower performance
with hyperthreading enabled.  I forget the kernel version, but I think
it was 2.4.20, might have been 2.4.18.
On a single CPU box, hyperthreading is probably a plus. I wonder if
2.5 handles hyperthreading any better.
