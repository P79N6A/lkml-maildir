Why is this a nono? I've been using that for quite a while without
problems. It seems that even though I overclocked it the system is
stable at all voltage / frequency steps. (I only modified the reference
clock and not the core voltages)
Also, 2.16 only shows a wrong value, the cpu is clocked at the "correct"
(overclocked) frequency, at least the bogomips value matches what I'm
expecting.
kind regards Philip
