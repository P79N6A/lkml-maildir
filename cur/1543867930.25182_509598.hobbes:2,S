Hi,
I agree with most points. Here the new design proposal:

I think it is not necessary to have a special entry/kobject for each logical
port. I suggest we use SET_NETDEV_DEV to create links to all ethernet devices
that represent each a logical port. This should be in sync with all other 
ethernet drivers. Port attributes like the "logical port id" that might be 
need by the userspace application can be added to the net:ethX entry
(link created with SET_NETDEV_DEV) as additional attributes. 
Thus we have a simple and consistent way to determine 
all currently available network interfaces (logical ports) and its
corresponding IDs.

True. I suggest we return error codes (-EIO / -EINVAL) in case the adding
or removing of ports fails. This is possible as we know instantly if the
operation failed or not. It is a synchronus operation.

no break wanted here as "remove_port" might cause situations where
not all currently available ports are in a row
