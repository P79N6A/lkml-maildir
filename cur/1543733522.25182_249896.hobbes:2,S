Wait, I think that a properly coded ioctl can always
figure out this is a compat call by looking at the command
(see example below).
So maybe we can live with just one new entry point with these
semantics?
MST
Example:
my_ioctl.h
//This structure size is different on 32 and 64 bit systems
struct my_foo {
  long foobar;
};
#define FOO _IOR(MY_MAGIC,0,struct my_foo)
//
my_ioctl.c
struct my_foo32 {
  int foobar;
};
#define FOO32 _IOR(MY_MAGIC,0,struct my_foo32)
static int ioctl_native (struct inode *inode, struct file *file, unsigned int
    opcode, unsigned long udata_l);
static int ioctl_compat (struct inode *inode, struct file *file, unsigned int
    opcode, unsigned long udata_l);
static int ioctl (struct inode *inode, struct file *file, unsigned int
    opcode, unsigned long udata_l)
{
  switch (opcode)
  {
    case FOO32:
      return ioctl_compat(inode,file,opcode,udata_l);
    case FOO:
    default:
      return ioctl_native(inode,file,opcode,udata_l);
  }
}
