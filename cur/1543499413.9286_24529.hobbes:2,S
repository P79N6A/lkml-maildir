   i've included a simple shift-add replacement for the current buffer hash
   function.  the buffer hash logic is now like the other hashes; there
   seemed to be no good reason for it to be different.
Please factor in the device number in the buffer cache hash function,
it matters a lot believe it or not.
Also, it appears as if a lot of the hash setup code does the same
thing in all the spots, with only a few differences.  It would be very
nice if you could package this up into a generic "setup_hash_table()"
function which were given minimal heuristics to size and allocate the
hash table, and let the caller initialize it.
Later,
