If you make the function disable_irq() slower, then handler->ack will be
so slow too. It's exactly the same SMP problematic as far I can tell. Same
for enable_irq() and handler->end. And I am talking about dp264 that is
the only alpha SMP platform I know (for the other non SMP platform I am
been careful to not add any controller lock).

Oh, it got dropped in 2.3.x, sorry. It's still the case in 2.2.x though
(and it's certainly not changed because enable_irq now has two spinlocks
to pass).

At least ide.c code does disable/enable for each request_fn.

Ok, that's certainly welcome, thanks.

2-way is fine here. 4-way I don't know yet :)
