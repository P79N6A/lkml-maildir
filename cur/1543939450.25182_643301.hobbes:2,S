quirk_disable_msi() can not fix the issue in my debug, 
quirk_msi_intx_disable_bug() which can fix SB700 SATA MSI bug does not
work either.
quirk_disable_all_msi is the only workaround I found.
If there is any other guy who also has one SB600+RS690 board, and can
help
to  verify this RS690 MSI disablement patch with a new kernel version
such as
2.6.24-rc7,  that's great.
BTW:
RS690 MSI disablement should NOT affect SB700 MSI, because as I know, 
there will not be the combination of RS690+SB700 on the market.
Thanks
Shane
