Hi, dear community,
The problem: under heavy network load
(2000 frame/sec and more, traffic produced with Fluke)
reading from the packet socket (SOCK_PACKET)
fully loads the processor every ~30 sec (PII-650).
The higher is the traffic level, the longer is the
"heavy system load" interval.
I have tried two NICs (3COM with 3c90x and Kingstone with tulip),
in promiscuous and normal mode - with the same effect.
Any help and/or information about this/such problem
is greatly appreciated.
Does it cause dropping of packets ?
Is there a way to workaround the processor load ?
Cheers,
Alexander Riesen
