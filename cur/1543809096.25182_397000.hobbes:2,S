Like the i386 family? Having seen some more of the code, I found that the posix-
timers.c also has it's own family of time routines (plus routines that seem quite 
hard to use inside the kernel, so I added just another wrapper). I really think 
these are too many functions all dealing with getting the current time. I really 
think that nowadays all lower resolution clocks should be derived from the POSIX 
time routines (I'm talking about the concept, not a particular implementation).
