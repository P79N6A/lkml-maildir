Subject: Re: [linux-usb-devel] [PATCH] USB BIOS early handoff only when the we the driver is configured

At the moment I have a Jetway/VIA Mainboard which seems to have a
problem with the handoff.
Evenwhen I wait about 20 seconds the EHCI_USBLEGSUP_BIOS flag is not
cleared. I think this is a BIOS
bug and I will have to talk to Jetway/VIA.
On the other hand, I don't need the EHCI controller in my kernel, so I
think the kernel shouldn't take the
handover for the EHCI controller like other OS which do not have an usb
driver and so don't know that
there is a EHCI_USBLEGSUP_BIOS flag which should be cleared.
