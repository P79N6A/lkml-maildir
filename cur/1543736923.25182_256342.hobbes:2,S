Exactly.  What does the community want?  An alternative is to allocate a small 
block of memory for this and managed it from the posix-timers.c code.  It would 
only be referenced by get_clock and set_clock.  And be released by the 
exit_itimers() code.

I think they WILL be inline as well as attached if you attach them.  The 
difference is that in both presentations neither mailer will mess with white 
space.  This means that long lines will not be wrapped and tabs vs space will 
not be changed.
Try sending yourself one and see it this is not true for your mailer.

NO.  This is handled through the dispatch table (as set up when you register the 
clock).  You just supply a timer_create() function that returns the right error. 
  Likewise, attempts to use clock_nanosleep().  The issue with clock_nanosleep, 
however, is that it, at this time, is not sent through the dispatch table.  This 
should be changed to, again call the same error function.
