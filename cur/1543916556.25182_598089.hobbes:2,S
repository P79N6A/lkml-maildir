For non high res systems we speed up the access to now by storing the
current time when we start to process the hrtimer softirq callbacks.
hrtimer_cb_get_time(timer) reads timer->base->now
For high resolution systems hrtimer_cb_get_time() resolves to
timer->base->get_time().
In the timerfd case we are not in softirq context and we read at any
given later time. Also on SMP the base->now variable might be changed by
the softirq running on the other CPU.
