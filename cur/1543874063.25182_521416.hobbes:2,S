I did this.
What happens is:
	neigh_setup is called
	dst_ifdown changes the neigh->dev to loopback device
But the funny thing is that this neighbour can thinkably hang
around indefinitely now, and if it does destructor won't be called
and there won't be a crash.
To trigger a crash, I did simply
	ifconfig lo down; ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1
and sure enough it crashes in drivers/infiniband/ulp/ipoib/ipoib_main.c.
