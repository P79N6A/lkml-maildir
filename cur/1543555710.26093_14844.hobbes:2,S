I look at the raw stack data from time to time, but mostly I want
the backtrace, PC and LR converted into something more meaningful,
and I don't want the extra clutter of that particular raw data.

Not so.  This is my point; on the ARM, when you get stuff like stack
and registers dumped, a lot of the hex numbers can look very much like
addresses in kernel space; most of them are data object symbols and
the like.  There can be a lot of these, and suddenly you'd end up with
most of the System.map being output because something in the dump
somewhere looks like its a symbol.

Yep, now that is one idea I like!
