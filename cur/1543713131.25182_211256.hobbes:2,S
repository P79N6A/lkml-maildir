Sure, but HZ will still be irrelevant.  There won't be a HZ to report.

It's not possible to change USER_HZ.  There are too many programs with
the number hard-coded into the binary.  The best we could do is make
the HZ userspace macro non-constant, so it calls sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK),
and wait a few years until practically all programs being used no
longer contain a hard-coded constant.  Then we could get rid of USER_HZ again.
