This is using HT as all AMD systems do, but this is one of the 8
socket systems.  
I ran the same test on a 2 node Tyan AMD box, and did not notice the
atrocious spin times. It would be interesting to see how a 4 socket HT box
would fare. Unfortunately, I do not have access to one. If someone has access
to such a box, I can provide the test case and instrumentation patches.
It could very well be the hardware limitation in this case, which means, all
the more reason to enable interrupts with spin locks while spinning. But is
lru_lock an issue is another question.
Thanks,
