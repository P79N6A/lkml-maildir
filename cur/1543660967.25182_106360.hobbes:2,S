Subject: [RFC] Enhance CPCI Hot Swap driver

Hi, Scott,
After reading your CPCI Hot Swap support codes, I have a suggestion
to enhance it:
How about to make it be full hot swap compliant?
I mean we could also do some works like "disable_slot" when we receive
the #ENUM & EXT signal. Hence the user could yank the hot swap board 
without issuing command on the console.
How do you think about it?
Cheers,
-Stan
