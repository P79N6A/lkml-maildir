Actually, it doesn't. IIUC, it gets it from /proc/bus/pci/devices. That 
info is formatted in drivers/pci/proc.c::show_device().

I couldn't find any place that ia32 writes the PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE register 
during boot. And, manually reading in various places (before, during, and 
after enabling a device) always returned the same info.

AFAICT, lspci is getting it from /proc/bus/pci/devices. I'm getting the 
source now to sift through and verify. Alternatively, the data is also 
available in the 'irq' file in each PCI device's sysfs directory.
