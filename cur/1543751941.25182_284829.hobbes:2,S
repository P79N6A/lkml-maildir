Hello Randy,
     Thanks for ur help. See I do know that pipe.o is
compiled into the main kernel image. But the following
code block in pipe.c, made me to think as if pipefs
has been implemented as a module in the kernel. Bcoz
it used module_init and module_exit macros. That's why
I got confused. Can u explain the reason for this?
Thanks,
selva

static DECLARE_FSTYPE(pipe_fs_type, "pipefs",
pipefs_read_super, FS_NOMOUNT);
static int __init init_pipe_fs(void)
{
	int err = register_filesystem(&pipe_fs_type);
	if (!err) {
		pipe_mnt = kern_mount(&pipe_fs_type);
		err = PTR_ERR(pipe_mnt);
		if (IS_ERR(pipe_mnt))
			unregister_filesystem(&pipe_fs_type);
		else
			err = 0;
	}
	return err;
}
static void __exit exit_pipe_fs(void)
{
	unregister_filesystem(&pipe_fs_type);
	mntput(pipe_mnt);
}
module_init(init_pipe_fs)
module_exit(exit_pipe_fs)

 Where do you see that?
 fs/pipe.o is always built into the kernel image.
