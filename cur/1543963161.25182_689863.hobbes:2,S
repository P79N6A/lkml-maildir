Sorry for the delayed response here. The below looks pretty good to me,
though it'll require a few modifications to fixup smp_call_function()
from irq disabled context.
But that's doable, though I have to do a grep over the kernel to check
everything (I remember CPU send_stop being one such path). Not a huge
fan of such an interface, but hey...
Is everyone OK with going this route, initially at least? It's the
lesser of all evils, I think.

This part puzzled me, why? We default to 'n' and let converted archs
opt-in, so I don't get this part of your patch...
