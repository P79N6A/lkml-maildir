I noticed that some places have the construct:
	root_inode = iget(sb, MSDOS_ROOT_INO);
	if (!root_inode)
		goto out_no_root;
	sb->s_root = d_alloc_root(root_inode);
	if (!sb->s_root)
		goto out_no_root;
while others do:
	sb->s_root = d_alloc_root(iget(sb, MSDOS_ROOT_INO));
	if (!sb->s_root)
		goto out_no_root;
which looks somewhat cleaner at first sight, but can leak an inode if
the iget() succeeds and the d_alloc_root() fails.  Do you want to fix
this while you're in the area?  :-)
