I cooked a program shorter than Jie one, to try to understand what was going 
on. Its a pure cpu burner program, with no thread synchronisation (but the 
pthread_join at the very end)
As each thread is bound to a given cpu, I am not sure the scheduler is allowed 
to balance to an idle cpu.
Unfortunatly I dont have a 4 way SMP idle machine available to
test it.
$ gcc -O2 -o burner burner.c
$ ./burner
Time to perform the unit of work on one thread is 0.040328 s
Time to perform the unit of work on 2 threads is 0.040221 s
I tried it on a 64 way machine (Thanks David :) ) and noticed some strange
results that may be related to the Niagara hardware (time for 64 threads was 
nearly the double for one thread)
