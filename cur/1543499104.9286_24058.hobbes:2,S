Thank you!  I've been wanting this for ever so long.  I was about to
complain that I'd never seen it documented, but man 1 mount does indeed
document -L and -U switches for these.
However, man fstab doesn't show any such options, and still claims to be
for Linux 0.99 from 1993.  Where do I get the updated page?
The addition of these features should have been announced with much
fanfare.  Did I miss something?
