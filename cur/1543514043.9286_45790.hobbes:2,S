Solaris looks at the file permissions only, not the owner, to
determine whether the filename can be deleted in a sticky directory.
This is the case even for symlinks, so if you create a symlink in
/tmp, then I, or any other user, can delete that symlink. This is not
a feature that Linux should copy!

From the version number, I presume that's DEC OSF/1? 
Some OSF/1 variants still don't have lchown. At least one variant
allows you to chown symlinks if and only if they are dangling. Yuck.

You won't get any argument from me there.
Personally I'd like the Linux sticky semantics to stay as they are. I
think they give the user the least surprise. Programs that create
world-writable lock files in /tmp are actually quite common, even on
systems where anyone can delete such files; Linux gives the user some
protection from broken programs that use these files.
