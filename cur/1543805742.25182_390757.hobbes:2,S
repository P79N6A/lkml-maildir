That's GPL working *as* *intended*.  No, you can't create a derivative
of GPLv2 program and prohibit the use of your modifications in other
GPLv2 programs.  It's not just "Linus won't accept it upstream"; it's
"you can't even distribute such fork yourself".  And it's 100% intentional -
that's what GPL is about.
As for the harm...  We somehow survived years of similar "harmful" situation.
No, you can't put proprietary code in kernel and prohibit other GPLv2
projects to reuse it.  Yes, it would theoretically turn some authors of
extremely valuable (but never materializing) code away.  And yes, there had
been very similar whining and dire warnings.  Nothing new here...
