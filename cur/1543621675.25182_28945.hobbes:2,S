No, that's not nearly studly enough ;-)
Since we have gone to all the trouble of sharing the page table, we should
swap in/out for all sharers at the same time.  That is, keep it shared, saving
memory and cpu.
Now I finally see what you were driving at: before, we could count on the
mm->page_table_lock for exclusion on read fault, now we can't, at least not
when ptb->count is great than one[1].  So let's come up with something nice as
a substitute, any suggestions?
[1] I think that's a big, broad hint.
