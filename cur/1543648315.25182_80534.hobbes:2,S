Fine.  I'll just yank the {get,set}_posix_acl methods for now.  The
inode methods were only needed for the NFS code (see Andreas' comments
about the xattr interfaces being problematical for VFS support).  
However, the reality is that at this point, we probably won't have
time to get support in for the NFS server ACL before feature freeze,
and changing the interface to ACL's (never mind the headaches of
trying to agree to a new syscall interface at this late date), given
the deployed userspace tools, just doesn't seem to be realistic.
So if you or Andreas has time to work on NFS server support for ACL's
in the next two days, great, but I'm going to just pass on this for
now.  Later on, we can figure out what changes are necessary to all of
the various filesystems so that nfsd can get what information it
needs.
