yes, i'll do so and test the patch. is this in current -BK yet? because
applying your patch [1] to 2.6.10-rc1 gives:
Hunk #1 FAILED at 181.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file lib/kobject.c.rej
i've done a few other things before, let me just post the results before i
go on with your suggestions:
i've compiled a recent (BK) 2.6.10-rc1 again with CONFIG_EDD=m|y|n

http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/prinz/2.6.10-rc1/config-2.6.10-rc1_edd.txt
http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/prinz/2.6.10-rc1/config-2.6.10-rc1_no-edd.txt
the results:
http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/prinz/2.6.10-rc1/dmesg-2.6.10-rc1_edd-modular.txt
http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/prinz/2.6.10-rc1/dmesg-2.6.10-rc1_edd.txt
http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/prinz/2.6.10-rc1/dmesg-2.6.10-rc1_no-edd.txt
the interesting thing (for me) was, that when CONFIG_EDD=m was set, my
sound card was working properly and i could do "modprobe edd" and "rmmod
edd" as i like:
http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/prinz/2.6.10-rc1/typescript-2.6.10-rc1_edd-modular.txt
again: i double checked and compiled on 2 different hosts, each having
it's own -BK tree.
thanks,
Christian.
