I've got a box that will nolonger boot off it's scsi disk anymore, (but dual booting to windows works just fine...) did anyone ever get to the bottom of what caused the "attempting to queue an abort message" bug was?  I've tried booting my normal 2.4.16+preempt and a 2.4.2 kernel known to work previously and neither get pass trying to identify the devices on both channels.
