IRQ7 is usually connected to the parallel port. If there is no driver
installed, that expects interrupts, you could end up with this
annoying message because the printer status bits are all ORed into
that IRQ line. You can disable this with software, though, and it
might be a good idea.
          outb(0, BASE+2);
... where BASE is 0x278, 0x378, 0x3bc, etc.. the printer ports.
Also, a catch-all for confused interrupt controllers is IRQ7. Even
without a parallel port, you can still get an occasional spurious
interrupt. I think the kernel should have an interrupt handler for
this interrupt that does nothing except ACK the interrupt and
keep its mouth shut.  The request_irq() procedure should ignore
the fact that it is "in use", and let any driver have it without
sharing it.

    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
