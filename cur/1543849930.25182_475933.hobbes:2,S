(sorry for the duplicate send but the yahoo mailserver is having problems :()
... should the duration of the the kernel compilation be prolonged then by 
unneeded modules? Does the majority of people really use that crypto hardware or
is it a small percentage only, we don't know but it also doesn't seem pretty sensible to do
'make oldconfig' and go and turn off all modules that I don't need/have by hand;
it gets quite annoying sometimes too.
