It's not a problem of mousedev, but the problem of make menuconfig.
The relevant part of .config is
#
# Userland interfaces
#
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV=y
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV_PSAUX=y
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV_SCREEN_X=1024
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV_SCREEN_Y=768
# CONFIG_INPUT_JOYDEV is not set
# CONFIG_INPUT_TSDEV is not set
# CONFIG_INPUT_EVDEV is not set
# CONFIG_INPUT_EVBUG is not set
Starting from original linux-2.6.5.tar.gz it seems impossible to
disable CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV_PSAUX without disabling CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV.
If I comment out the line CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV_PSAUX by hand, make
silently restore this line to yes.
Regards,
E.R.
