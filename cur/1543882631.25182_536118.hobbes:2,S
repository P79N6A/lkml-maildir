Yes, the "percentage" thing was likely wrong. That said, there *is* some 
correlation between "lots of memory" and "high-end machine", and that in 
turn tends to correlate with "fast disk", so I don't think the percentage 
approach is really *horribly* wrong.
The main issue with the percentage is that we do export them as such 
through the /proc/ interface, and they are easy to change and understand. 
So changing them to amounts is non-trivial if you also want to support the 
old interfaces - and the advantage isn't obvious enough that it's a 
clear-cut case.
