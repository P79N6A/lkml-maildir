Daniel Robbins, William Lee Irwin and myself were on the
phone with people from AMD today.
One possible cause for this problem was already tracked
down a while ago; this problem isn't the fault of any
particular part of the system (CPU, OS, AGP or graphics
driver) but simply a consequence of how these things
work together. Of course we don't know if this particular
bug is the one hitting Linux systems with nvidia.
I won't post my poorly explained version of the story
here as the AMD guys are working on releasing their
well-written version of the story somewhere in the next
few days...
kind regards,
Rik
