Learn. This place is not exactly UNIX 101, you know...

Than don't use it, damnitall! WTF are you doing on l-k in that case, may I
ask you? devfs may be good/bad/whatever, but _why_ _the_ _green_ _bloody_
_fsck_ is it discussed on l-k by people who apparently never cared to look
at the code it should interact with? It's not a democracy and vox
co^H^Hpopuli doesn't work here (or anywhere else, for that matter).
Could we _please_ stop this bogosity? Take care to read the kernel source
if you want to produce arguments for inclusion of the thing into system.
It is a prerequisite. And let Richard speak if/when he wants to do it. At
least he _did_ care to RTFS. Sheesh...
