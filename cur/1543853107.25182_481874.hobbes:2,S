There's some confusion here. On the one hand, you placed your driver
in the hwmon directory, and integrated it in the Hardware Monitoring
menu. But on the other hand you seem to think that the input tree is
the natural merge path for this patch. Isn't it strange?
This raises the question of what these drivers (ams, hdaps...) really
are, and where they really belong. The hdaps driver is very different
from all other driver in the hwmon directory. Maybe they would be
better located in drivers/input/accel? This is an open question, I
really don't know.
(Side note: you could use the -p1 parameter of diffstat for better
results.)
