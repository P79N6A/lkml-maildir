This is all fairly easy to implement. I'd suggest just comparing the
cached value of atime with the current time, and updating it in
nfs_file_read if the discrepancy exceeds some timeout value.
Dunno about adding an extra mount option though: why not use the
ordinary attribute caching timeouts and keep things simple? IMHO mount
is already bloated with enough unnecessary NFS options.
What are people's feelings about this?
Cheers,
