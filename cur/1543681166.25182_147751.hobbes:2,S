POLLRDONCE isn't linked to epoll - it's a valid hint for poll/select too.
It means something different, i.e. you can't write:

Be careful, because that isn't valid if there is urgent data.  You
need to check POLLPRI too.  Granted urgent data is usually best ignored :)
If fast hangup is a useful optimisation too, we should have both flags.
(However calling read() doesn't seem like a great penalty for that).
