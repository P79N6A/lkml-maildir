have You seen that patch we're speaking about ?
It simply subdivide the runqueue in clusters and give the scheduler a
logarithmic low as function of the number N of runnable tasks.
1) It's very simple
2) Under home usage give practically the same results ( probably less then 1%
cost )
3) Under high load gives great results due to the pseudo-logarithmic low

Not always patching codebase introduces new bugs.
AFAIK Linux codebase is grown about 10x form 1.0 to 2.3.X and not only bugs
were introduced into the sources.
