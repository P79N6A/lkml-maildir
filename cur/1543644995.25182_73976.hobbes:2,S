Which imples that it's 2.7 material.
For 2.6.x I care about getting the drivers _working_.
The whole logging discussion with hardened drivers etc is _not_ adding
value to normal people until much much later, and it sound very much to me
like one of those patch sets that some vendors will care about deeply
because they have some big company that cares and pays them.
Those kinds of patch-sets sometimes never make it into the standard 
kernel. They have to prove their worth to real people first, and I could 
care less (but not much) about paperwork reasons.
