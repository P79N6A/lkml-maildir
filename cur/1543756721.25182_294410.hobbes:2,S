Hello again,
Thanks for the evtest.c program and the information about evtouch. After the
minor change from LONG(BTN_LEFT) to LONG(BTN_TOUCH), patch below, I
was able to then get touch on/off events. Also I tested this driver with the
"evtouch" Xwindows driver and it worked nicely.
Thanks,
Rick Koch
