Yes, it is basically the same problem as the buffer cache. Excessive
single-use patterns dirty the small cache or require a too big cache to be
usefull.
Maybe a user specific limit of percentage of hash (and locks) used? I mean
the untar test case is a bit synthetic, but think of concurrent read access
in a cluster of nntp servers (news article pool).
