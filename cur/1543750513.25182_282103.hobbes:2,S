Okay I've rebuilt the via drm tree (bk://drm.bkbits.net/drm-via)
It should work but I've no way to test it, I think the drm is close to
secure now if not already, and if I get the nod from the people who know
these things (Thomas, Erdi and Keith - consider yourselves the people),
I'll try and have it included in 2.6.11
Dave.
