Well, do people realize that 'git bisect' is *not* a textual
half-way between, but rather is computed every time you feed
new "the patch you told me to test last time was good/bad"
information?  I do not think statically generating a huge text
and telling the user to apply up to halfway and bisect by hand
would not work -- it would be quite different from what git
bisect would give you.
I think public webserver based bisect service David Lang
suggests might work.  The interaction with it would start by the
end user somehow giving it the last known-working commit ID (A)
(pick from gitweb shortlog, perhaps) and a commit ID newer than
that that broke things (B) (again, pick from gitweb shortlog).
Then the service runs bisect on the server side, spit out a diff
against (A).  The end user applies the patch, try it, and then
come back and tell if it worked or not,...  Since we are talking
about the kernel development, I think the cycle might involve
rebooting the machine; so you would probably need two machines
(one guinea-pig machine to reboot, another to keep the browser
open so that your state can be kept somehow).
