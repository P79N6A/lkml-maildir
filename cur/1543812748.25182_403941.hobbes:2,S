I think that solving the "busy inodes" problem is sufficient.  The
reference count on dentries isn't *wrong* as someone is actually
holding a reference.  It is just that generic_shutdown_super doesn't
expect anyone else to hold any references.  Fixing the "busy inodes"
problem means that no-one else will be holding any references, so it
becomes a non-problem.

No, I didn't :-(  I obviously didn't do enough homework.
The significant differences seem to be:
 - you test ->s_prunes inside the spinlock.  I don't bother.  Yours is
   probably safer.
 - You call wake_up every time through prune_one_dentry while I try to
   limit the calls.  As each call is a function call and a spinlock,
   maybe at least guard it with
      if(waitqueue_active()) ...

I don't see how I am parallelising anything.  Multiple shrink_dcache_*
can still run.  The only place that extra locking is done is in
generic_shutdown_super.
But what do you think of Balbir Singh's patch?  I think it is less
intrusive and solves the problem just a well.
Thanks,
