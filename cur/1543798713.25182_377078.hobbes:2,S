My count of bug reports for problems with in-kernel code with 4k stacks 
after Neil's patch went into -mm is still at 0. That's amazing 
considering how many people have claimed in this thread how unstable
4k stacks were...
Enabling 4k stacks unconditionally for all -mm users will give us a 
wider testing coverage and will tell us whether we have really fixed all 
bugs that become visible with 4k stacks or whether there are still bugs 
left.
-mm kernels contain many experimental features, and "completely removed" 
isn't really true because we can expect that people running the 
experimental -mm kernels to know how to un-apply a patch.
