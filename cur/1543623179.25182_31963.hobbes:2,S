Subject: Invalid @home email addresses

Precedence: bulk

On 1 March 02 cox@home switched their services from infrastructure hosted 
on hardware by Excite to "native" hardware.  All @home.com addresses are 
now invalid.  Grepping through the source for these invalid addresses 
produced the following:
drivers/net/de4x5.c 	mmporter@home.com
drivers/scsi/megaraid.c 	johnsom@home.com
drivers/scsi/ppa.h	johncavan@home.com 
drivers/scsi/imm.h	johncavan@home.com 
drivers/sound/aci.c	pellicci@home.com
drivers/media/video/bttv-cards.c	daniel.herrington@home.com
Most addresses for home.com users simply switched to cox.net addresses.  
However, email to the above users at cox.net bounced in four out of five 
cases.  I am posting here in hopes that theses users are still on the 
mailing list and will respond.  If no response is received I would like to 
submit a patch adding comments to the source code indicating the addresses 
are no longer valid and no new email addresses are known.  
Note:  The above addresses also exist in the 2.5 tree.  I also intend to 
submit a patch for the comments in the 2.5 tree.  Following is a patch to 
correct my email address in the 2.4 tree.  This patch is against 2.4.18.
