And the only way the syscall code could find out if there is an error is by
checking err < 0 && err >= -4096 like glibc (except for the compat
syscall on 64bit kernel case) 
Or rewrite all code that returns errors to system calls to pass
a separate flag too.

It doesn't do it because it's useless without a kernel rewrite.
I frankly doubt it really works on Sparc :-) Maybe it could work
there on a hypothetical rewritten kernel, but not today.
