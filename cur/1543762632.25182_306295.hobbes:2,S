Ok.  What's happening is that the ARM pgd_alloc uses pte_alloc_map() to
allocate the first L1 page table.  This sets mm->nr_ptes to be one.
The ARM free_pgd knows about this, and will free this PTE at the
appropriate time.  However, exit_mmap() doesn't know about this itself,
so in the ARM case, it should BUG_ON(mm->nr_ptes != 1) if we're using
low vectors.
I guess we could hack it such that the ARM pgd_alloc decrements mm->nr_ptes
itself to keep things balanced, since free_pte_range() won't be called
for this pte.  However, I don't like that because its likely to break at
some point in the future.
Any ideas how to cleanly support this with the new infrastructure?
