ok. Can you hold off pushing NFS bits to Linus until this gets
pinned down ? I really don't want to introduce any more variables
to this, especially when its so hard to pin down to an exact
replication scenario.
Trond thinks this could be not just NFS related but something
lurking deeper within net/   which could be even more annoying
to pin down, though I don't see any other odd network related
behaviour.
