Agreed, but we need more generic drivers when possible anyway. Just think
about Tekram drivers for DC-390 boards. They just ignored anything
different from Tekram adapters. Btw, my Netgear FA311 board is not handled
by the sis driver of linux-2.2.20 and my little finger tells me that it
could be so given a few code addition.

Let me adver^H^Hocate: :-)
Just some pricing from France:
- K7S5A (without NIC option) : FF  590
- ASUS A7M (example)         : FF 1300
- CM8378 Mentor sound board  : FF  119
K7S5A + Mentor sound board     -> FF  709
ASUS A7M (with bogus VIA 686B) -> FF 1300
The K7S5A is a great Mobo, good quality, very fast and very cheap, as long
as you donnot want to use on-board sound. :)
The K7S5A I have is used by my children under Windows, but I have stressed
it a lot under Linux and FreeBSD prior to leave them play with it.

Good point.
