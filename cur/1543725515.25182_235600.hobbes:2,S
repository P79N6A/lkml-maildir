I don't necessarily agree that such changes in the userspace interface
should be tied to the kernel version number, really.  That's a three or
four year warning period, which is unreasonably long.  Six to twelve months
should be long enough for udev-based replacements to stabilise and
propagate out into distributions.
That being said, mid-2005 would be an appropriate time to remove devfs.  If
that schedule pushes things along faster than they would otherwise have
progressed, well, good.
Nothing is cast in stone here btw - we're pushing the envelope, trying new
things, keeping that which works well and reexamining things which perhaps
don't work so well.  Feel free to disagree - we're listening.
