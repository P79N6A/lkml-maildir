Hi,
I noticed the following line in dmesg output with 23-rcX kernels
ACPI Warning (tbutils-0217): Incorrect checksum in table [OEMB] -
5E, should be 31 [20070126]
Before I start investigating the issue I wonder: Is this something
serious or just a minor issue? My system works just fine so far
(normal usage, 23.rc2-rc7).
