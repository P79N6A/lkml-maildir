not surprisingly, i have a script "arraysize.sh":
============================================================
#!/bin/sh
DIR=$1
# grep -Er "sizeof\((.*)\) ?/ ?sizeof\(\1\[0\]\)" ${DIR}
# grep -Erl "sizeof\((.*)\) ?/ ?sizeof\(\1\[0\]\)" ${DIR}
for f in $(grep -Erl "sizeof\((.*)\) ?/ ?sizeof\(\1\[0\]\)" ${DIR}) ; do
  echo "ARRAY_SIZE()ing $f ..."
  perl -pi -e "s|sizeof\((.*)\) ?/ ?sizeof\(\1\[0\]\)|ARRAY_SIZE\(\1\)|" $f
done
===========================================================
  anyone who's interested can run it with a single argument of the
directory to process, eg.:
  $ arraysize.sh fs
  $ arraysize.sh drivers
  $ arraysize.sh .		# entire tree, of course
it's just a first pass, but it seems to produce reasonable code.
