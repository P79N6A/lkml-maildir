well, I think the bottleneck is that DaveM and Linus are at
linux.conf.au at this time. I have submitted a patch that according to
my tests works at least on i386, x86_64 and ppc32.
Just give them a bit more time.  Original patch attached again

[NETFILTER] x_tables: Fix XT_ALIGN() macro on [at least] ppc32
To keep backwards compatibility with old iptables userspace programs,
the new XT_ALIGN macro always has to return the same value as IPT_ALIGN,
IP6T_ALIGN or ARPT_ALIGN in previous kernels.
However, in those kernels the macro was defined in dependency to the
respective layer3 specifi data structures, which we can no longer do with
x_tables.
The fix is an ugly kludge, but it has been tested to solve the problem. Yet
another reason to move away from the current {ip,ip6,arp,eb}tables like
data structures.
