Look.  Two people (Brandon and I) have now told you how to read rpms without
rpm software.  They're just .cpio files with a header.  That's it.  Nothing
complicated, nothing fancy, nothing you cannot open on any Unix machine in
the world.  Or are you trying to claim that cpio is non-standard?  Unlike
binhex4, I can actually open cpio on every Unix machine I admin.
Now, can we *please* kill this thread?  It has absolutely nothing to do with
kernel development, and I'm sick enough of RMS's asinine flamewar already
without having to put up with this one as well.  If you want to argue with
me privately, then do so, but keep it off the list.
