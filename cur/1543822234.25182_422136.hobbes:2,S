Yes, I agree. It would not be an optimal solution, because other upper
level protocols (e.g. SDP, SRP, etc.) or userspace verbs would not be
affected by this changes. Nevertheless, how can an improved "scaling"
or "SMP" version of IPoIB look like. How could it be implemented?

Sorry, my idea was not to use the *.pdf file how it should be
implemented. I only wanted to show that other people are also thinking
about how TCP/IP performance could be increased and where the bottlenecks
(e.g. SOFTIRQs) are. :)
