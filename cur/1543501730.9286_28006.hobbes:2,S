Stop. The generic PPP layer should have one frame type - PPP. It might
be given a notice if the layer is reliable or not, and if it is
dialable. 
Think about PPP over X.25 where the X.25 is done by the card firmware.
The PPP layer needs to not know about media types.

That does seem kind of unavoidable. On the other hand for channels not
part of your multilink bundling and the like I can still register myself
a sync device for say a smart firmware driven PPP and interact in all other
ways as if I was using your layer.
The killer problem with the SCSI code is there is no way to say "give me
3 disks, 1 CD, 1 controller and plug me directly into the request queue"
