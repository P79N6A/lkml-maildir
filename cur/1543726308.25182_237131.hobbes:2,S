With hot cache the system time is really small.
On a 2GHz Pentium 4, Compare
	find .-type f -mtime -2000 >/dev/null
with
	find . -type f -mtime -2000
in a freshly checked out 2.8 kernel tree.
(the -mtime test is to force a stat, otherwise, as Ulrich says, almost
no stat system calls will take place)
	to xterm     	>/dev/null	| xargs grep foo
sys	0.34		0.103		0.35
user    0.29		0.08		0.104
real    18.551		0.204		220.25
Using strace reveals that around 60% of the system time in the
redirected to /dev/null case is lstat64 --- 41465 calls, 1.5usec per
call.  Where it's in a pipe that uses the files, the time is swamped
by the time to process the files, and the time spent in write() ---
lstat64 drops to around 16% of the time in find.
The nice thing about the current three-copy implementation is that
it's simple and obviously correct.  Personally, I don't think that the
increased complexity of arhcitecture-specific callbacks, etc., is
worth the small performance gain.
