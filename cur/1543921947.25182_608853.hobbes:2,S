There was an old American Music/Comedy show called "Hee Haw!" which had 
a recurring skit consisting of a farmer running into the doctor's office 
and saying
   "Doctor, doctor! It hurts when I do this!" followed by some unlikely 
activity.
   The doctor always replied "Then don't do that."
Turning off bluetooth is a useful diagnostic test, but for some systems 
it's not a practical operating configuration. Any thoughts on making 
bluetooth work in these cases? Most laptops make a unit like the 
Logitech MX5000 BT keyboard desirable for extended use.
