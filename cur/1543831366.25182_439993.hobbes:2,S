Subject: [patch 0/7] Improve MSI detection v5

Here's another set of patches to cleanup MSI detection to
replace the patchset that is currently in Greg's tree.
After -mm5 breakage due to some root chipsets not having a
subordinate bus, we now use the dev->no_msi flag to disable
MSI on a chipset instead of the subordinate bus flag (see #3).
Other changes include a TTL in the pci_find_next_capability()
loop to find MSI HT cap (see #5), and changing the ipath driver
to use the common PCI_CAP_ID_HT (see #4).
#1 - Merge existing MSI disabling quirks
#2 - Factorize common MSI detection code from pci_enable_msi() and msix()
#3 - Check root chipset no_msi flag instead of all parent busses flags
#4 - Rename PCI_CAP_ID_HT_IRQCONF into PCI_CAP_ID_HT
#5 - Blacklist PCI-E chipsets depending on Hypertransport MSI capability
#6 - Drop pci_msi_quirk
#7 - Drop pci bus_flags
These patches are against 2.6.17-git20.
