Dear Seniors,
Greetings!
Being very new to Linux. On my 2nd day with Linux i encountered a problem
that im unable to resolve. I was trying to Boot Linux, from a different
system setup
configuration then from the one when i installed it.
Installation Configuration:
I installed Linux when there was only 1 HardDrive(2.1GB LBA), 1 IDE CD-ROM
Drive, 1 PCI Network Card, But No SCSI Hosts, Drive
Partitions(DOS-FAT16=805MB, Linux Native=1101MB, SWAP=108MB).
With the above configuration i  booted linux cuple of times that day.
Test Configuration:
Now when i tried to boot Linux, when the system setup contains,
  1 IDE HardDrives(2.1GB LBA) -(1st Controller as Master)
Partition(DOS-FAT16).
  1 IDE CD-ROM Drive               -(1st Controller as Slave).
  1 IDE HardDrives(2.1GB LBA)
-(2st Controller as Master) Partitions(DOS-FAT16=805MB, Linux Native=1101MB,
SWAP=108MB).
  1 SCSI HardDrive(1GB).           -(on SCSI Host Adopter).
Partition(DOS-FAT16).
  1 PCI Network Card.
etc...
Now in the BIOS Setup i set the BOOT SEQUENCE to "D" drive, the one on the
2nd controller, ie.
1 IDE HardDrives(2.1GB LBA)
-(2st Controller as Master) Partitions(DOS-FAT16=805MB, Linux Native=1101MB,
SWAP=108MB).
 After restarting i got the"boot:" (prompt). It booted DOS, no problem with
that.
Now when i tried to to boot linux, it started booting linux but stoped after
giving the "Kernet panic: VFS Unable to mount root fs on 03:02". Please see
attachment of Last Screen Shot for booting details - and if possible can
anybody make
it easy for me understand.
How can i resolve this problem? do i need to reinstall Linux?
if so, can i have it install with the current configurations(on 2nd
Controller HDD),
My next setp was to install WinNT4(Server) on 1st HDD, along with Win97
(currently installed), and after removing DOS Partition form SCSI HDD and
dividing it half for UNIX and half for (DOS 6.22 or Win97) +
WinNT4(WorkStation).
Where can i find more help.
Thanks
Best Regards
-Kazmi
