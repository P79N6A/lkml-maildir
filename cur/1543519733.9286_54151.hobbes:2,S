hmm - so threads form one process do get scheduled across multiple
cpus? in that case i migt yet get a decent speedup (altho i'm giving
the memory bus a good kicking whilst i'm at it so i probably wont get a
2x speedup since i'll get memopry contention - or likely will - ut
thats to be seen form tests if i can get any decent speedup via threads)
