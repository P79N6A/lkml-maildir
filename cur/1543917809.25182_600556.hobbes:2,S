I would personally prefer it if this patch got scheduled into
2.6.23, it is a bug fix and it might even account for some of
the futex weirdness we're still seeing on sparc64.
I'll toss this patch to some folks seeing those issues for testing.
But even if it doesn't fix their bug, it still belongs in 2.6.23 and
there is no reason to delay this fix.
