Sorry to reply a long quiet thread, but I've been trading emails with Paul 
Jackson on this subject recently, and I've been unable to convince either him 
or myself that merging CPUSETs and CKRM is as easy as I once believed.  I'm 
still convinced the CPU side is doable, but I haven't managed as much success 
with the memory binding side of CPUSETs.  In light of this, I'd like to remove 
my previous objections to CPUSETs moving forward.  If others still have things 
they want discussed before CPUSETs moves into mainline, that's fine, but it 
seems to me that CPUSETs offer legitimate functionality and that the code has 
certainly "done its time" in -mm to convince me it's stable and usable.
