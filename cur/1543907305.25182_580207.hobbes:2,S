Just change root=/dev/hda1 to append="root=/dev/sda1" in lilo.conf.
And change fstab. If You don't change "/" then system will go into single 
user mode after reboot.

I don't think it is possible. If I remember right kernel can't be older  
then glibc kernel headers.
Btw. My disk is 20GB 2,5" ATA33. I wonder how 26MB/s is possible. I don't 
expect more.
