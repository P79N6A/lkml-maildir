Subject: testing the low-latency patch

I did a little testing of the low latency patch, 2_2_10-N6B.
Configuration:
	plain 2.2.10 with and without the patch
	all other config options the same
	dual pentium II - 400
	384MB RAM
	SCSI disk with Adaptec controller, ASUS P2B
	2GB ext2 file system with 1K blocks
When running with the patch I can repeatably lock up the computer
by running a utility which creates and writes a new file as fast
as it can.
fill junk 500000000 65536 66
	create the file "junk"
	write 500 million bytes to it
	in write() calls of 64k at a time
	using a buffer filled with char c = 66
I don't get a crash, it just hangs responding only to reset.
Writing 500MB always makes it hang.  100MB didn't.
300MB sometimes does.  Competing with other things seems to
make the 300MB write more likely to hang.  Plain 2.2.10
gets a bit unresponsive but never hangs.
I also did some testing using a program I wrote a year ago
to test whether I could use Linux for a project which requires
soft real time.  The test runs two processes and a custom
shared memory queue library to pass messages between them.
The writer does usleep() and each time the timer expires it
writes a message with the current time down the queue.  The
reader compares the time in the message with the time it
reads the message and calls the difference the delivery time.
The reader waits in select() when the queue is empty and is
awaken by a message on a Unix domain socket.
This is actually a very kind test since if the machine is 
locked down doing some uninteruptable task the writer will 
not get a chance to write a message in the first place.  
A better test would use a genuinely independent start time.
All memory was locked down with mlockall().
Both processes in the test were run with real time priority.
No other processes in the system had real time priority.
Both tests start out competing with an "rm" of a 300MB file
which was recently written and is still mostly in the cash.
For the plain 2.2.10 test it competes with writing another
300MB file.  For the patched test I kept getting lock ups
so I ran a kernel compile instead.
The following are histograms of delivery times.

I believe unlinking a large file is deadly to latency.
Both patched and unpatched I get >100ms delays as
a result.  If I run similar tests competing against
CPU bound tasks or kernel compiles I get very few
events over 10ms.
The rest of the long latency events cut off very sharply
after 10ms.  I guess it is related to the 10ms timer
triggered scheduling.  Perhaps sometimes the availability
of data in the pipe does not immediately trigger run
readiness.
I am very glad someone is paying attention to latency in
Linux.  My project is working well in Windows NT but when 
I deal with installation and remote maintenance I often 
wish for Linux.
If there is some way I can help please ask.
