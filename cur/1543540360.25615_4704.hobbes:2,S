Cool logic. How do you define "much"? Drive electronics can still use
a lot of power, and most users (xuan and me excluded ;) want this for
power-save.
In practise, of course, there is a clear trade-off between ugly error (!)
messages from the kernel drawing for your attention and not putting the
drive to sleep.
In general, the kernel support is lacking much with respect to
power-savings (just spin down your scsi-drive to get some nice hang (and
yes, I know the scsi-idle patch)).
