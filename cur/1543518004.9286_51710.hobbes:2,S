Ext2 is currently being worked on significantly.  The new one may be called
Ext3 or Journalled Ext2.  In any case it's a significant change and changing
the storage of links should be possible.
ReiserFS is developing much faster and this could probably be added in a
smallish amount of time.
What about NetApp Filers and other NFS serving devices.  I would expect a
NetApp to be able to do this - unless the client was a Linux machine...
As work is currently in progress on 64bit files, 32bit link counts would
probably be a good idea too.  These changes should fit well together because
many of the same system calls have to be changed...
