Ah, thank you.
Obfuscation is not to be discounted, however. Imagine a 64 bit pid_t. Now,
the race would, on average, take longer than the remaining lifetime of the
universe to exploit.
A 32 bit pid_t is more interesting (and plausible). Assuming a _signed_
pid_t, a rather high rate of 1000 exploit attempts/second, and a 100% race
success when the right pid is guessed
.. you take on average 11.5 days to exploit. At 100% CPU. That's not going
to go unnoticed.
Cheers
Chris
