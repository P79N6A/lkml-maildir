Simple: we should not implement cmpxchg in generic code. We should
be able to use atomic_long_cmpxchg for this -- it will work perfectly
regardless of what anybody else tells you.
cmpxchg is only required for when that memory location may get modified
by some other means than under your control (eg. userspace, in the case
of drm, or hardware MMU in the case of Christoph's old page fault
scalability patches).
