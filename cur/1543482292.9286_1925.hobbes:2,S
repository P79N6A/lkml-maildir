Oh dear.  Maybe Linus was feeling masochistic this morning, cos we now
have TWO 2.2.0-final kernels to deal with.  I thought everyone was going
nuts until I looked, and since 1am today (Tuesday) 2.2.0-final has
existed, and is even (woohoo) in the v2.2 directory ;-)
The downer is that we've been talking about 2.2.0-final since the middle
of last week (i.e. pre9), and now no-one will know which kernel people
are talking about - ARGH.
Let's get 2.2.1 out quick ;-))
But it's great news anyway (!)
