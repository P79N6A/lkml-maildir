Nit: SELinux figures out what to label new files fine, just not based on 
the name. This works in most cases, eg., when user_t creates a file in 
/tmp it becomes user_tmp_t, incidentally this is something that AA 
cannot handle, if the filenames aren't normalized (they normally 
aren't). For example, my ssh agent socket is stored in 
/tmp/ssh-XXXXXXXX, where the X's are random characters, AA can't 
differentiate admin ssh agents from unprivileged user ssh agents, 
showing a serious flaw in their model.
The complaint is that name-based labeling doesn't currently exist (and 
as Sean has stated that doesn't mean it _can't_ exist, just that it 
doesn't currently). In practice this has not been as big of an issue as 
you are making it out to be. Granted restorecond has a tiny race, and I 
wouldn't recommend using it on very security sensitive files but for 
usability having it relabel user_home_t to user_http_content_t isn't a 
problem (and causes no security issues).
