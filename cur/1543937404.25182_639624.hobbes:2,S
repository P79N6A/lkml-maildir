I introduced /proc/self/mountstats because we need a way for non- 
block-device-based file systems to report I/O statistics.  Everything  
else I tried was rejected, and apparently what we ended up with was  
reviewed by only a handful of people, so no one else likes it or uses  
it.
It can go away for all I care, as long as we retain some flexible  
mechanism for non-block-based file systems to report I/O stats.  As  
far as I am aware, there are only two user utilities that understand  
and parse this data, and I maintain both.
