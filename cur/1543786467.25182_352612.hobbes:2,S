  You should try Ben LaHaise's patchset which includes
Suparna's patches. It's available as a single patch at:
http://www.kvack.org/~bcrl/patches/aio-2.6.13-rc6-B1-all.diff
 
and broken down at:
http://www.kvack.org/~bcrl/patches/aio-2.6.13-rc6-B1/

  libaio is meant as a way for using the kernel AIO support but 
does not provide a POSIX compliant interface.

  I've been using libaio-0.3.92 with success.

  Just like libaio, libposix-aio uses the kernel AIO support but 
provides a POSIX compliant interface.
  There are no man pages yet, but you can look a the SuSV3 
specification (links are on 
http://www.bullopensource.org/posix/
).
  For completeness, I should add that there is a POSIX AIO
implementation in glibc librt but it uses helper threads to achieve
asynchrony and does not use kernel support.

  None, libposix-aio used to rely on libaio for the syscalls but that's
no longer the case.

  Right now support is provided for:
	i386	- tested
	ia64	- not tested
	x86_64	- not tested
  If you're willing to add support for other platforms there is
only one file to add for implementing the architecture dependant
syscalls, such as syscall_arm.h or syscall_ppc.h. Look at the sources.

  That should be OK. Look at the examples in libposix-aio, in
the check and testbed subdirectories.
