Before you list the benefits, you should always talk about the lack of 
security! Let nobody enable it without realizing the dangers! Tell people 
to _only_ do this inside a company firewall, and even then, only if you 
trust everybody.

Why do people use that silly "ssh+git://" format?
It's a cogito thing. Native git has never done it, and only supports it 
because cogito thought it must make sense.
The native git ssh URL is exactly the normal ssh URL:
	server:/path/to/repos/repo
and if you really want to use the "xxx://" format, you might as well just 
use
	ssh://server/path/to/repos/repo
which should also work fine.

PS. This is the commit message that  added "git+ssh://":

	    Support git+ssh:// and ssh+git:// URL
	    It seemed to be such a stupid syntax. It's both what "ssh://" means,
	    and it's what not specifying a protocol at _all_ means.
	    But hey, since we already have two ways of saying "use ssh with
	    pack-files", here's two more.
so it was deemed stupid from the get-go, and isn't even some "legacy" 
thing. It's purely a "cogito people thought it makes sense to point out 
that it's _both_ native git _and_ ssh protocol".
