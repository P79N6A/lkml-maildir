Thanks, this solved the problem. After I activated portmap I could login
again without any delay.
BTW: does anybody know a place where I can get a portmap daemon that
compiles with glibc-2.1? It is the last program I did not update so far -
mainly because I thought I got rid of it at last ;-) Old things seem to
die hard.
