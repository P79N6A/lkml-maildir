I can do all sorts of things, but frankly, I just need my device to
work (which it does again, courtesy of myself). Apart from that, this
is still just what a SCO-person would call 'a structural copy' of my
code with no functional changes, especially none that could result in
any additional output. I believe it will work as well. Mine does, so
I am not going to test a different one for the sake of having done so.
If you want to fix it only if you can claim to have written the code,
fine. If you'll never fix it --- fine as well. In either case, I have
already put more time into this as I have available.
