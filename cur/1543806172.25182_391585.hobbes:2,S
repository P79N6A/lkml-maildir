the main cost comes from accessing the test-buffer when the buffer size 
gets above the real cachesize. There are a coupe of ways to improve 
that:
- double-check that max_cache_size gets set up correctly on your 
  architecture - the code searches from ~64K to 2*max_cache_size.
- take the values that are auto-detected and use the migration_cost= 
  boot parameter - see Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt:
        migration_cost=
                        [KNL,SMP] debug: override scheduler migration costs
                        Format: <level-1-usecs>,<level-2-usecs>,...
                        This debugging option can be used to override the
                        default scheduler migration cost matrix. The numbers
                        are indexed by 'CPU domain distance'.
                        E.g. migration_cost=1000,2000,3000 on an SMT NUMA
                        box will set up an intra-core migration cost of
                        1 msec, an inter-core migration cost of 2 msecs,
                        and an inter-node migration cost of 3 msecs.
  (a distribution could do this automatically as well in the installer, 
  i've constructed the bootup printout to be in the format that is 
  needed for migration_cost. I have not tested this too extensively 
  though, so double-check the result via an additional 
  migration_debug=2 printout as well! Let me know if you find any bugs 
  here.)
  via this solution you will get zero overhead on subsequent bootups.
- in kernel/sched.c, decrease ITERATIONS from 2 to 1. This will make the 
  measurement more noisy though.
- in kernel/sched.c, change this line:
                size = size * 20 / 19;
  to:
                size = size * 10 / 9;
  this will probably halve the cost - against at the expense of 
  accuracy and statistical stability.
