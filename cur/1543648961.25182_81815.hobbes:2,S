_really_?
No, really?
How quaint.  So RMS et.al. would be unable to implement a simple C compiler
in MACRO-10 and use it for bootstrap?  Or clone aforementioned MACRO-10?
Pathetic.  And I suspect undeserved - I'm no fan of RMS, but I don't believe
that what you claim is true.
Now could we fscking take that crap to some place where it would be on-topic?
