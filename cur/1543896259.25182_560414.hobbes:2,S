Why does the importance of the property matter to the validity of the
argument?

Why does whether or not the key is required to use the software matter? It
may be impossible to use a Linux kernel on a particular piece of hardware
without the BIOS, that doesn't mean the BIOS source code is part of the
kernel source code even if the kernel is shipped for that hardware.

Nice argument. I'm wrong because people can disagree with me.
