I have a ECS K7S5A Pro Mobo, with an Athlon Xp cpu and am compiling 2.4.22 
with GCC-3.2.2 on RedHat 9.0. I set the athlon/k7 option for the cpu in the 
kernel config. When I attempt to boot with 2.4.22 it freezes when 
'uncompressing Linux...'.I tried turning ACPI/IO-APIC off, same error. Just 
wondering if anyone has had the same problem. Or if anyone has any idea how I 
can fix this.
