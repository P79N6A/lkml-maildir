I would if I had some hardware to play with *hint* *hint* ;)
The SDIO spec is publically available on the SD card associations web 
page so it shouldn't be too difficult to get some basic support. But I 
can't do much as long as I don't have any hardware to test it with. I 
might also need specs for the card itself. I haven't looked too much at 
SDIO at the moment.
