Hi Andrew,

Seems you're confused. (-; The patch came in two parts, one that is
stable and tested, and an experimental one I don't have the hardware
for to test it.
But since you ask for, here we go: The following is a patch against
2.6.8-rc4 to add support for all NetMOS devices I could get hold of:

Ok, the support for the 9805, aka titan_1284p1 is tested and works. 
(That was the first patch). Support for the NetMOS 9815 is already in
for a while - that's the two-port version of the 9805.
What is experimental is the support for all other netmos devices, namely
the 9705, 9735, 9715, 9835 and 9755. Specifically, I don't have the full
PCI id's and replaced the vendor IDs by PCI_ID_ANY, which should *hopefully*
work out. In other words, this really requires some testing, at best by
someone who has the mentioned boards. The 9805 based board is sold here
in Germany in "every store round the corner". All others - I don't know -
might also come with additional serial ports.
