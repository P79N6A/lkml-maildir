Get the patches directory from the ftp server and put it into the 
source tree as "patches". Install quilt.
Then select a middle patch from the series file. I would start it 
on the boundaries of the various groups Andrew comments first.
Then 
quilt push middle-patch 
compile/test 
if works select new middle in partition below, otherwise above.
repeat until you narrow it down to a single patch.
If the partition is below you have to use quilt pop ... instead of quilt push
Sometimes patches don't compile on their own, but in this case
treating them as groups is ok.
Also when you hit the last patch double check it really changes
the problem by retesting with it applied again.
