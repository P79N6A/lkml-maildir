JP> You are using 2 second delay, which might be a bit short, but not unreasonable.
I have tested this not by shutting down my system but by running a
test script, watching "ps -AH e" after each run.
After first run of "killall5 -15; sleep 2; killall5 -9" NFS daemons
DON'T die at all. After second run only nfsd dies. Only third run
kills lockd and statd. It does not matter how long I wait between
runs. (however I didn't wait for minutes. Do you want me to try it?)
Am I supposed to do the same in shutdown script, i.e.
killall5 -15; sleep 5; killall5 -9; sleep 5
killall5 -15; sleep 5; killall5 -9; sleep 5
killall5 -15; sleep 5; killall5 -9 ?
This looks ugly and total sleep time is 25 sec.
A better way is to make NFS daemons understand what user wants after
first call, not a third.
