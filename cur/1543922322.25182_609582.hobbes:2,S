It's not just a bug, it's a regression ... a new bug which
was introduced by some patch.  ;)

SPI works fine on all the MMC and SD cards I've got here,
other than the minor glitch fixed by the "don't just probe"
patch I sent.
As you know, to be spec-conformant they *must* support SPI.
Agreed, there are too many vendors who don't appear to value
following specs.  If those cards which are using the MMC or
SD trade marks, you might notify the relevant consortium and
asking them to fix those vendors.  ;)

I'm not sure what you mean by "dump", but appended the sysfs attributes
produced after I disabled that new "just probe" mechanism.

This is a dump of the /sys/class/mmc_host/mmc0/mmc0:0001 file attributes
(except the card serial number) for a SanDisk MMC card which doesn't like
SPI requests (like reading OCR) before the reset finishes.
This card _used_ to enumerate with the MMC-over-SPI stack, but
a recent change in the MMC core now prevents it from doing that...
