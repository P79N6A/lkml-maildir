And that's what I did in the last pull you got from John; all pointless
and duplicated ioctls were removed.  The only ones left are mesh
tweakables, an LED GPIO control ioctl, and a regulatory region/domain
thing.  I agree the interface is somewhat ugly (like the
char-128/char-128 ones that return information from the mesh forwarding
table), and I also agree that we need to move to using netlink for this
sort of stuff in the future.  There are _no_ ioctls that duplicate WEXT
functionality.
