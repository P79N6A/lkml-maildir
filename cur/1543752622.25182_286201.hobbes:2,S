I don't know about the pax one, we were careful with the fc one to not
break prelink for obvious reasons ;)

actually I was hoping to feed some bits of execshield (eg the
randomisation) to you sometime in the next weeks/months, after a
thorough cleaning of the code, and defaulting to off.
The code can be made quite reasonable I suspect if I manage to find a
few hours to clean it up some
(the pre-cleanup patch is at
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/arjan/execshield/00-
randomize-A0
in case you want to see for yourself)
that patch randomizes the stack (well already done via an x86 specific
hack in the existing kernel, this pulls that more generic)
the brk start
the start of mmap space (but leaves mmaps where the app gives a hint for
the address alone, like ld.so does for prelinked libs)
