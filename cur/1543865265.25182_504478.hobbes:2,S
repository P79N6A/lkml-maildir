Thanks.  Did you get any nasty messages about "No irq handler for vector?"
If not then you never even hit the problem condition.
Given how rare the trigger condition is it would probably take force
irq migration to even trigger the "No irq handler for vector message".
That patch I'm not really worried about, I've tested it and it meets
the obviously correct condition :)  But it should enable people to
not be afraid of IRQ migration.
I'm slowly working my way towards a real fix.  I know what I have to code,
now I just have to figure out how. :)
