Yes, but not yet publicly available.  I use quilt to keep the patch 
series up to date and do the change as a relatively large series (30 or 
so) to make it easier for me to cope with changes in the kernel.  When I 
do the next release I'll make a tar ball of the patch series available.
Of course, if your eager to start right away I could make the 
2.6.17-rc4-mm1 one available?
