Right.  poll() and Solaris /dev/poll are programmer-friendly; they give 
you the current readiness status for each socket.  ircu handles them fine.
/dev/epoll and Linux 2.4's rtsig feature, on the other hand, are
programmer-hostile; they don't tell you which sockets are ready.
Instead, they tell you when sockets *become* ready;
your only indication that those sockets have become *unready*
is when you see an EWOULDBLOCK from them.
If this didn't make any sense, maybe seeing how it's used might help.
Look at Poller::clearReadiness() in
http://www.kegel.com/dkftpbench/doc/Poller.html#DOC.9.11
 or
http://www.kegel.com/dkftpbench/dkftpbench-0.38/Poller_sigio.cc
and the calls to Poller::clearReadiness() in
http://www.kegel.com/dkftpbench/dkftpbench-0.38/ftp_client_pipe.cc
