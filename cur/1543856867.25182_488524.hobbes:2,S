I'm working on an embedded system with the 2.6 kernel -- cpio
initrd was a new feature I'm looking at (and very welcome).
The major advantage I see is you don't have MAKE a filesystem
on the build host (doing cross development).  So you don't have
to be root.
But its "useful" to change permissions/ownership of the initrd
files at times...
Since a cpio is just a userspace created string of bits, I suppose
you can apply a set of ownership/permissions to files IN the archive
by playing with the bits...
Does such a tool exist?  Comments?  Seems very useful in order to
avoid being root...
