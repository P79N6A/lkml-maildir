I agree.  In looking over the code some more, I'm trying to figure out
why we are exporting that variable at all.  Is it because of people
wanting to stack security modules?
I see selinux code using it, but you are always built into the kernel,
right?  So unexporting it would not be an issue to you.
Tony, would AppArmor have problems if we don't export that variable
anymore?
