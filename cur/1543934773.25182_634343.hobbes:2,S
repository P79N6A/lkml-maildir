We can easily [he says, glibly] reproduce the hang on the anon_vma lock
with AIM7 loads on our test platforms.  Perhaps we can come up with an
AIM workload to reproduce the phenomenon on one of your test platforms.
I've seen the hang with 15K-20K tasks on a 4 socket x86_64 with 16-32G
of memory and quite a bit of storage.
I've also seen related hangs on both anon_vma and i_mmap_lock during a
heavy usex stress load on the splitlru+noreclaim patches.  [This, by the
way, without and WITH my rw_lock patches for both anon_vma and
i_mmap_lock.]  I can try to package up the workload to run on your
system.

Makes sense.  we'll have to see.
