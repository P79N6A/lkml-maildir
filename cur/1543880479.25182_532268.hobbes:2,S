I have been thinking about this and I don't think that exporting motor
data is a good idea, at least not in case of Phantom driver. The fact
that there are 3 motors is a hardware implementation detail and it
is not interesting for general application.
My understanding that the end result of controlling these 3 motors
is a force vector (I don't know if there is such english term, this
is a literal translation from russian) applied to user's hand.
If we are interested in using FF API we need to come up with a way
to express this effect without exposing implementation details of
one particular device.
