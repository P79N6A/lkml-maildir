do you mean this paragraph:
| I guess /proc/meminfo, /proc/zoneinfo, /proc/vmstat, /proc/slabinfo 
| before and after the updatedb run with the latest kernel would be a 
| first step. top and vmstat output during the run wouldn't hurt either.
correct? Does "latest kernel" mean v2.6.22.1, or does it have to be 
v2.6.23-rc1? I guess v2.6.22.1 would be fine as this is a VM problem, 
not a scheduling problem.
the following script will gather all the above information for a 10 
seconds interval:

Ray, please run this script before the updatedb run, once during the 
updatedb run and once after the updatedb run, and send Nick the 3 files 
it creates. (feel free to Cc: me too)
