[poor you - you must have a slow connection]
Two possibilities: (i) blink from user space,
(ii) blink from kernel space.
There is a program setleds in the kbd distribution that sets the leds.
Source fragment:
int setleds(char leds) {
    if (ioctl(0, KDSETLED, leds)) {
        perror("KDSETLED");
        return -1;
    }
    return 0;
}
There is also a kernel routine that accepts kernel calls:
See keyboard.c, routines register_leds(), setledstate().
In ancient times people used this for "blinkenlights".
Have not checked recently whether this still works.

cc'd to l-k -- no doubt there are people that'll want to play
with the lights again
