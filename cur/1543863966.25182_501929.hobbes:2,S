Hi,
I'm currently working on a port to a CPCI board with a MPC5200.
When testing the PCI interrupt routing, I discovered the following:
Even devices which don't use interrupts (-> PCI Spec.: Interrupt Pin  
Register is zero),
get an interrupt assigned (this is at least true for most of the  
PPC-targets I looked at).
The cause is pretty obvious in drivers/pci/setup-irq.c.
I guess at least in an ideal world with correctly designed hardware, the  
code should
rather look as in the patch below.
Of course it doesn't hurt anybody to have an unuseable IRQ assigned to a
PCI-to-PCI-bridge (or something alike), but to me it seems a bit strange.
Please correct me, if I'm mislead.
The patch below is tested on the above mentioned CPCI-MPC5200 board and is  
compiler
tested with the latest git-repository kernel on x86.
Best regards,
Andreas

Don't assign IRQs to devices, which don't need any
