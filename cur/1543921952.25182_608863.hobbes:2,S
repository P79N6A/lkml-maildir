Well... true enough on a small firewall machine with a really fast link, 
maybe. I like your point about efficiency better, it's more logical, 
like putting an ACCEPT of established connections before a lot of low 
probability rules. The only time I have seen rules actually bog a 
machine was when a major ISP sent out a customer "upgrade" with a bug 
which caused certain connections to be SYN-SYN/ACK-RST leaving half open 
sockets. They sent out 160k of them and the blocking list became very 
long as blocking rules were added.

As long as the filter table doesn't go away, sometimes things change 
after PREROUTING, like NAT, and additional rules must be used.
