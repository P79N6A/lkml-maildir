A rm does not actually remove things that are still accessed.
As an example, do the following (1 and 2 are shells, cdimage is a full
CD image):
1> less cdimage
2> df .
2> rm cdimage
2> df . 
1> q (quit less)

If the appication of a user was writing some important output to a file 
on the NFS mount you want to umount there will be data loss...
If you _really_ want to umount something still accessed by applications 
simply kill all applications with "fuser -k".
