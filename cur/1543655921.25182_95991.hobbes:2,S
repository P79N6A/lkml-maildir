Subject: [2.5.51] Failure to mount ext3 root when ext2 compiled in
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Just noticed this (usually ext2 is compiled as a module, but was
testing a patch with CONFIG_MODULES=n).  Reverted to plain 2.5.51, and
it's still there:
	VFS: Cannot open root device "301" or 03:01
	Please append a correct "root=" boot option
	Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 03:01
Now, I have an ext3 root, but when CONFIG_EXT3_FS=y and
CONFIG_EXT2_FS=y, I get this failure.  Turning off CONFIG_EXT2_FS
"fixes" it.
Hope this helps,
Rusty.
