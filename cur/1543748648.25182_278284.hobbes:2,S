Russell,
Ah, now I understand that thing.  Reading the comments again, I should 
have seen the reason for this earlier.
I am sorry I can not test that patch since unloading of the modules I am 
currently testing blocks anyway. This makes it very hard to test the 
patch :-( and currently this was the reason why I was going to this.
Sorry if I caused any inconvenience.
