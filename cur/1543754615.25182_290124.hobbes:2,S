Your opinion on some things are different than the opinions of other 
people on some issues. That's normal.
Then a discussion arises.
That's normal and part of a review of some code.
E.g. the "module name discussion" covered a real problem.
Be it 1 email or be it 100 emails - the main point is simply that all 
code in the kernel should be as good as possible and as near as possible 
to kernel standards.
The Linux kernel is a big project with _many_ people involved.
I've also had people telling me that this or that I sent in a patch was 
nonsense. That's normal (and a criticism of your code is not meant as a 
personal insult) and leads to better code in the kernel.
