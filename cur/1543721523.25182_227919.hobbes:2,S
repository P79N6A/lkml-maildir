From a technical point of view I'm just wondering how it comes this 
firmware is derived from the Linux kernel? I mean this is running on an 
8-bit microcontroller with some 4KiB of memory so it sounds pretty much 
impossible to me.
If anybody would have a point calling this a derived work from Linux, I'd 
be very concerned about SCO might have a point with their claims wrt. 
Linux being derived from their IP =(:-(
From the maintenance POV of course it would be much better not to have it 
aggregated with the kernel sources.
