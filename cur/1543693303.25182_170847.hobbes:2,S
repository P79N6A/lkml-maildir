The hotplug event points to the sysfs location of the kobject, that's
all.  libsysfs then takes that kobject location and sucks up all of the
attribute information for that kobject, which udev then uses to
determine what it should do.
Unless we want to pass all attribute information through hotplug, which
we do not.
Do you have any suggestions?
thanks,
