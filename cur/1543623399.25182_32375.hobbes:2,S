Good luck; they're fairly rare.  From what I can tell, Cisco only 
supports jumbo frames on the Catalyst 5000 and 6000 families.  Extreme 
supports them on at least a few models.  The cheapest jumbo frame 
switch that I could find is the Intel 480T, which is over $7,000.
After doing a bunch of benchmarking, for our hardware and workload, 
jumbo frames don't really seem to help performance much anyway, so I 
ended up getting a $1,300 Dell 5012 (10 10/100/1000, 2 GBIC) switch.
I've heard rumors that Asante will have a jumbo-capable switch in May 
or so.  Since they seem to OEM the same hardware that Dell does (for 3x 
Dell's  cost), I wouldn't be too suprised to see a $1,500 16-port gig 
switch from Dell in a few months.
