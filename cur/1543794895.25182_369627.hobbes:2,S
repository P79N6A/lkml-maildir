    There are two new patches for Robust Futex support available at
    
http://source.mvista.com/~dsingleton
    patch-2.6.14-rt13-rf3 fixes two locking bugs which caused hangs and 
deadlocks.
    patch-2.6.14-rt13-rf4 adds support for pthread_mutexes 'malloc'ed on 
the heap.
    I'd also like some advice on the direction POSIX is heading with 
respect to
    robust pthread_mutexes and priority inheritance.
    It appears there are some not used openposix tests that use 
different flags for
    defining robustness.      Here is a snip from the openposix robust 
test's README:
Robust Mutex Tests
------------------------
The tests are under <rtnptl-tests>/robust_test directory.
rt-nptl supports 'robust' behavior, there will be two robust modes,
one is PTHREAD_MUTEX_ROBUST_NP mode, the other is
PTHREAD_MUTEX_ROBUST_SUN_NP mode. When the owner of a mutex dies in
the first mode, the waiter will set the mutex to ENOTRECOVERABLE
state, while in the second mode, the waiter needs to call
pthread_mutex_setconsistency_np to change the state manually.
Currently the PTHREAD_MUTEX_ROBUST_NP is providing
the fucntionality described by the PTHREAD_MUTEX_ROBUST_SUN_NP.
Any advice on which way we should go?   I feel we should follow
POSIX and provide both methods and the new pthread_mutex_setconsistency_np
function which provides the mutex recovery mechanism.
