Also on the v850, a usable gcc-3.x is a relatively recent thing, so I
still use gcc-2.x for most things -- and without the spinlock
workaround, gcc-2.x for the v850 crashes.  Perhaps other archs also have
similar issues (not everything is as well-supported as i386!).
Given that the spinlock workaround is an extremely small and isolated
piece of code, there doesn't really seem to be benefit to removing it,
so Linus, please apply Mikael's patch to restore the workaround.
Thanks,
-Miles
