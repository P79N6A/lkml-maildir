It has been several months but yes most of the pieces are simple.
Although you do loose the opportunities for several micro-optimizations,
that way.  The point was simply that working with relocations is even
less intrusive.  The changes stop at kernel/head.S if they even get
that far.  Plus the proof that you have not pessimized things is
trivial, because nothing has changed.
The fact that your kernel virtual addresses can be at different
2MB/4MB aligned boundaries is a downside, as is the fact that your
bzImage becomes 5-10% larger because of all of the relocations.
