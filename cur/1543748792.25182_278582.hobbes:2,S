Roughly 650mA for my laptop while idle or just under 7W - by calculation
from battery capacity and measured lifetime.  The question is how much
of that is due to the CPU itself and how much is due to the peripherals.

I don't disagree with your cellphone example - it makes a whole lot of
sense there, where the device is going to end up in someones pocket
not doing very much at all.
There is another twist here though - the Linux kernel kicks itself out
of idle mode and into some other thread multiple times a second while
the system is idle.  So far, in all my Linux kernel experience, I've
yet to see a kernel where it's possible to stay in the idle thread
for more than half a second.  (The ARM kernels I run are always
configured with IDLE LED support, so I can _see_ when it gets kicked
out of the idle thread.)
So, not only do the VST people need to solve the HZ interrupt problem,
but also need to track down which kernel threads keep waking up on an
otherwise idle system "just in case" they need to do something.
