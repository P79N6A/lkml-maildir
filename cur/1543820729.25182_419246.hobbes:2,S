Andrew (or preferably Linus since these are fairly simple and
unintrusive bug fixes), please pull from my tree at 
git://git.infradead.org/hdrcleanup-2.6.git

)
This tree contains a number of simple fixes for kernel headers which are
currently exposing things to userspace that should not be present
outside #ifdef __KERNEL__.
Since ifdefs are horrid, these patches tend not to add new ones --
mostly it's a case of moving things inside existing ifdefs, rather than
adding new ones.
Most of the patches are small and self-contained, except for the one
which removes #include <linux/config.h> from everything under include/
The individual commits are as follows:
      Remove user-visible references to PAGE_SIZE in include/asm-powerpc/elf.h
      Include <linux/jiffies.h> from linux/acct.h only in kernel-private part.
      Don't include agp_backend.h in user-visible part of agpgart.h
      Use __KERNEL__ to hide kernel-private bits of linux/gameport.h
      Export only the appropriate GS_xxx flags to userspace from generic_serial.h
      Include various private files only from within __KERNEL__ in genhd.h
      Sanitise linux/i2c-algo-ite.h for userspace consumption
      Sanitise linux/i2c.h for userspace consumption
      Don't include <linux/device.h> from user-visible part of linux/ipmi.h
      Remove gratuitous inclusion of <linux/pci.h> from linux/isdn/tpam.h
      Sanitise linux/mman.h for userspace consumption
      Don't include private files from user-visible part of linux/ncp_fs.h
      Don't include <linux/list.h> from user-visible part of linux/msg.h
      Don't include <linux/stringify> from user-visible part of linux/net.h
      Don't include private headers from user-visible parts of include/linux/nfs*.h
      Don't include private headers from user-visible parts of linux/quota.h
      Don't include <linux/list.h> from user-visible part of reiserfs_xattr.h
      Partially sanitise linux/sched.h for userspace consumption
      Don't include <asm/atomic.h> from user-visible part of linux/sem.h
      Don't include private headers from user-visible part of linux/signal.h
      Move comment in mtd-abi.h to stop confusing unifdef
      Don't include <linux/spinlock.h> from user-visible part of linux/wanrouter.h
      Don't export CONFIG_COMPAT stuff in linux/usbdevice_fs.h to userspace
      Sanitise linux/sunrpc/debug.h for userspace consumption
      Don't include private headers from user-visible part of linux/smb_fs.h
      Don't include private headers from user-visible part of linux/ext2_fs.h
      Don't include private headers from user-visible part of linux/ext3_fs.h
      Don't include <linux/config.h> and <linux/linkage.h> from linux/socket.h
      Don't include linux/config.h from anywhere else in include/
      Sanitise linux/audit.h for userspace consumption, split elf-em.h from elf.h
      Sanitise linux/sched.h for userspace consumption
Excluding the one-line files which have just <linux/config.h> removed,
the diffstat looks like this:
