Hello Bill,
    You are not alone.  It happened to all boxes with Intel E1000 network cards and integrated.  It happened on 2.6.2 kernel version and I downgraded back to 2.4.24 version and it was running fine.  The problems I experienced is network lag and lot of network disconnects and such.  It is the kernel 2.6.2 that this problem showed up.
   I haven't tried the latest versions yet that Linus just released to see if they fixed that issue yet.
