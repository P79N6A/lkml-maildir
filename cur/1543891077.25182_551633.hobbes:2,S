Subject: [PATCH] atmel_serial: Fix break handling
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/31/304

The RXBRK field in the AT91/AT32 USART status register has the
following definition according to e.g. the AT32AP7000 data sheet:
    RXBRK: Break Received/End of Break
    0: No Break received or End of Break detected since the last RSTSTA.
    1: Break Received or End of Break detected since the last RSTSTA.
Thus, for each break, the USART sets the RXBRK bit twice. This patch
modifies the driver to report the break event to the serial core only
once by keeping track of whether a break condition is currently
active. The break_active flag is reset as soon as a character is
received, so even if we miss the start-of-break interrupt this should
do the right thing.

It's been almost a year since the last patch I sent attempting to fix
this. Sorry for not following up any sooner.
Anyway, here's a new attempt. It should work even if we miss some
interrupts, and it should not break break handling by ignoring the
return value from uart_handle_break() as Russell pointed out.
There may be cases which aren't handled well: If you send two breaks
with no characters in between and we miss an interrupt on the first
one, the driver probably gets a bit confused. I don't see any way to
fix this, but the driver should get un-confused upon reception of the
next character.
I've tested this with Magic SysRq on ATSTK1000: It works with this
patch but not without. Ivan Kuten reported in a different thread that
SysRq didn't work on AT91RM9200 and I very much doubt it works on
AT91SAM926x.
The break count in /proc/tty/driver/atmel_serial also makes more sense
with this patch applied; without it, the break count increments by two
every time I send a break.
