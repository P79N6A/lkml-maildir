I have been thinking about some of the race condition we might run into.
Its hard to think all of them, when I really don't have any code to play
with :(
Anyway, I think race against truncate is fine. We hold i_alloc_sem -
which should serialize against truncates. This should also serialize
against DIO. Holding i_sem should take care of writers.
One concern I can think of is, racing with read(2). While we are
thrashing pagecache and calling filesystem to free up the blocks - 
a read(2) could read old disk block and give old data (since it won't
find it in pagecache). This could become a security hole :(
Thanks,
Badari
