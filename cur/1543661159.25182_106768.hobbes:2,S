Hi,
I've 2.4.19-pre10-ac2 running threaded applications (java application
server).... And I've got a problem with OOM killer -- it just unable to kill
threaded application (it writes thousands lines to kernel.log, but machine
still not responsive till reboot).
I've tried to play with overcommit setting 2, but w/o much success. It gives
me OOM condition in a few minutes after boot. With overcommit 0 (zero)
server runs just fine for months.
I've seen notes about ingo-oom-killer.patch for 2.5 that should resolve
issues with threaded applications. Do we have it for 2.4 ???
