Strictly speaking - yes. But, to make my life easier, I am trying
to approach it from the other sides as well:
Why not to have a SYN_CONFIG option to disable the terminal beeps
with *any* speaker driver (sparkspkr, m68kspkr etc)?
Or, why not to have the grabbing capability in the input layer, so
that the driver can request an exclusive handling of some events?
Both the above options look usefull in general, and I can get the
use of either one. Do you think both of the above options are bad
in general? (you may disagree with the way I am going to use them,
but that doesn't make them bad in general, I think)

But they really kill the snd_pcsp if they occur. They reprogram the
PIT channel 2 to a different mode, and the sound doesn't resume
after the beep, there is just some crackling remains. And it is
not even under the user's control - Mozilla mailer beeps me when
receives the mail for example. So not disabling pcspkr will make
the snd_pcsp very unreliable.
