I tried it out too since doing some greps after 3 days uptime crashed
it again.  Guess I am not so lucky.  So far so good with the new
patch, timer is using apic and no crashes yet, after 30 minutes of 
grep's and hdparms.  Tried booting with nmi_watchdog=1 and got this:
...trying to set up timer (IRQ0) through the 8259A ...
..... (found pin 0) ...works.
activating NMI Watchdog ... done.
testing NMI watchdog ... CPU#0: NMI appears to be stuck!
Going to retry with nmi_watchdog=2 and see if that works.
