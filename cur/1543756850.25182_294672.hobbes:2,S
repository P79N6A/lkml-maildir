I have:
Host: scsi1 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00
  Vendor: HL-DT-ST Model: DVDRAM GSA-4160B Rev: A300
  Type:   CD-ROM                           ANSI SCSI revision: 02
I also notice this with 2.6.10.  I think I also had it with 2.6.8.1 but I
don't remember, it's been a while.  The media I use is maxell DRM47 ver 2
(whatever that means).  I don't notice any jumping, but the system is quite
noisy as it is.  I have this same drive at work in a usb2 box but haven't
had the opportunity to try dvdram.
The DVDRAM above is not using ide-scsi emulation, it has a hardware scsi-ide
converter from Acard.  (I already have my ide ports used).  The scsi
controller is an adaptec dual u320 onboard (supermicro x5da8)
