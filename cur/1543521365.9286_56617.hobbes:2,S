CPU #0, #1 and #3 are stuck because CPU #2 grabbed the kernel_flag in
do_exit so we can ignore them.
The interesting line is:
spin_lock_irqsave(f808e66c) CPU #2 stuck at f00372c, owner PC(f003672c):CPU(2)
(I assume f00372c should be f003672c and is just written down incorrectly).
From a quick guess, f808e66c points to a sigmask_lock and CPU #2 is stuck
in __exit_sighand (called from do_exit):
static inline void __exit_sighand(struct task_struct *tsk)
{
        struct signal_struct * sig = tsk->sig;
        unsigned long flags;
        spin_lock_irqsave(&tsk->sigmask_lock, flags);
        if (sig) {
                tsk->sig = NULL;
                if (atomic_dec_and_test(&sig->count))
                        kfree(sig);
        }
        flush_signals(tsk);
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&tsk->sigmask_lock, flags);
}
The debug line says that CPU #2 has already obtained the sigmask_lock and is
trying to again and in the same spot! Sounds suspicious, I'll give the
sparc spinlock code a once over.
