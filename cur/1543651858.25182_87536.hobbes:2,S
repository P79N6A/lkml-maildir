Rusty's da man on this, but I think the fix is to not turn on
the interrupts (at the APIC level) until cpu_up() has called
__cpu_up().  Look at cpu_up():
        ret = notifier_call_chain(&cpu_chain, CPU_UP_PREPARE, hcpu);
        if (ret == NOTIFY_BAD) {
                printk("%s: attempt to bring up CPU %u failed\n",
                                __FUNCTION__, cpu);
                ret = -EINVAL;
                goto out_notify;
        }
        /* Arch-specific enabling code. */
        ret = __cpu_up(cpu);
The softirq storage is initialised inside the CPU_UP_PREPARE call.
So we're ready for interrupts on that CPU when your architecture's
__cpu_up() is called.  And no sooner than this.
