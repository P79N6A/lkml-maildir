Performance improvement should occur when private pages of multiple processes
are messed up, such as SMP. To UP, my previous mail is done by timer, which only
shows a fact, if pages are messed up fully, current readahead will degrade
remarkably, and unused readaheading pages make a burden to memory subsystem.
You should re-test your testcases following the advises on Linux without my
patch, do normal testcases and select a testcase randomly and record
'/proc/vmstat/pswpin', redo the testcase solely, if the results are close, that
is, your testcases doesn't messed up private pages at all as you expected due to
Linux schedule. Thank you!
