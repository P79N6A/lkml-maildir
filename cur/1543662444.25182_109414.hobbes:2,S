Does it do that on 2.4.x? I've certainly never seen that happen on a
stable kernel.
In fact ethereal reports 
 Message: pcap: File has 1045168887-byte packet, bigger than maximum of 65535
No wonder we see bizarre crashes...
There are several other odd features in this tcpdump. Random UDP
packets from the server to the client with a junk payload (usually
consisting of a load of zeros) appear to be pretty frequent.
Is this against a 2.5.x server? If so, could you try against a 2.4.x
or a non-linux server?
Cheers,

Note: I saw similar problems when I tried to convert the NFS client to
use the new zero-copy UDP interface (and so I dropped the idea).
