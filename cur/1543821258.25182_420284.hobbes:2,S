Hi Jesper,

This spacing is still wrong, because I first read it like this :
  i = (((numbits-(numblocks-1)) * bh->b_size * 8) / 16) * 2;
While in fact it's :
  i = ((numbits-((numblocks-1) * bh->b_size * 8)) / 16) * 2;
Strictly speaking, this should be written this way :
  i = ((numbits - (numblocks - 1) * bh->b_size * 8) / 16) * 2;
Or at least :
  i = ((numbits - (numblocks-1) * bh->b_size * 8) / 16) * 2;
Anyway, it's a good sign when only spaces are being discussed on a piece
of code ;-)
Cheers,
Willy
