Do you have any ideas here? For me it seems that the semaphore has a dual
role - protecting bus's lists and ensuring that probe/remove routines are
serialized across bus...
In the meantime, can I please have bind_mode patch applied? I believe
it is useful regardless of which bind/unbind solution will be adopted
and having them will allow me clean up serio bus implementaion quite a
bit.
Pretty please...
