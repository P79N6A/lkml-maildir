Hello,
I think I have found a bug in the kernel.
starting with 2.4.5ac23 and continuing through both 2.4.6 and
2.v.6-ac2 Whenever I try to do a lsattr or chattr on a directory
I get:
	"Inappropriate ioctl for device While reading flags"
on 2.4.5-ac19 I have no problem.
My computer is a pentium 3 with an asus motherboard, i810E
chipset,and ide drives.  running redhat 7.1 and the hard drive
is WDC WD600AB
I am more then happy to supply any more information if necessary
and
Thanks,
Gary
