I am seeing a lot of "pmtu discvovery on SA AH/03537192/c0a80003" type
messages (I forgot to check for them when on 100baseT; will recheck
that).  Are these indicative of such a problem?  I seem to recall that
reducing the max MTU is not as straightforward as just adjusting the
interfaces' mtu setting.  What should I do to eliminate pmtu as the
source of the problem?

I had been using 3des with AH; just retried with blowfish 448 and no
AH with much the same result.
