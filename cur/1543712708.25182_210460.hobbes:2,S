Whatever is the cause it might have come from -mm tree.
I remember than 2.6.5-rc2 worked with 5336nvidia, but when I applied
-mm2 it started to hang after X start or just made spontaneous reboot.
In case of -mm2 I'm almost sure 4KSTACK wasn't enabled, but can't check 
right now.
MREGPARM wasn't - that's sure.
