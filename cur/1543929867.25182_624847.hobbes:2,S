I'm puzzled by your statement.  Isn't the opposite true?  When using
"command line", doesn't the following happen?
1. My makefile sets O=/foo
2. My makefile invokes your makefile with O=/foo
3. Your makefile ignores my O=/foo because it requires O=/foo to
originate from the command line
4. KBUILD_OUTPUT never gets set to /foo and we hit the error
OTOH, if I use "file":
1. My makefile sets O=/foo
2. My makefile invokes your makefile with O=/foo
3. Your makefile accepts my O=/foo because it requires O=/foo to
originate from another makefile
4. KBUILD_OUTPUT gets set to /foo and my make succeeds
This all used to work the last time I tried it, which was sometime
during 2.6.23 development, IIRC.  Isn't the current structure going to
break just about all out-of-tree driver builds?
