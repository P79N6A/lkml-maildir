This is a part of execshield patch, fthe pie-compiled binary executable 
memory layout randomization was extracted from - see 
http://people.redhat.com/~mingo/exec-shield/exec-shield-nx-2.6.19.patch
Note that load_elf_interp() in vanilla kernel differs from the 
execshield's (and pie-randomization.patch) version.
The fix makes the BAD_ADDR check whether the address belongs to the 
ERR_PTR range, which seems valid for all uses of BAD_ADDR in the patched 
binfmt_elf.c (do_brk(), elf_map(), do_mmap() etc return valid address or 
err ptr) ... am I missing something obvious here?
