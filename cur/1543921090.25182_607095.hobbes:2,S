If we religiously relied upon BIOS support for everything in Linux,
then SATA drives wouldn't be doing anything more than emulating PATA,
and we'd still be doing PIO transfers for most PATA drives.
And ditto for many other areas in the kernel,
but that's the main one that I know a bit about.

So far, after a couple of days of intensive (disk!) I/O over the slot,
the answers are NO, NO, and NO.
