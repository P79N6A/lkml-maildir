I definitely agree with all that.
I simply argue that, the more time that passes between releases, the 
MORE BUGS that appear in the next release.
After -rc1, you reach a point of diminishing returns where users don't 
re-test Release Candidates, developers move on to new code rather than 
fix bugs, and we all move into a limbo where 2.6.X-rcY doesn't see much 
activity, but the huge "merge snowball" in -mm builds and builds and builds.
As an aside, if a release is getting held up by some key bugs or 
regressions, I think it's more than fair for Andrew to loudly shame said 
developers into action.  "The following nincompoops are holding up the 
release:  Jeff Garzik [bug #1222, #3391], Greg KH [bug #9987, #4418], ..."
