I've been flailing away at the ioctls in our driver, with a good degree
of success.  However, one in particular is proving tricky:

I still don't see how to replace this with anything else without
performing unnatural acts.
We use struct file's private_data to keep a pointer to the device in
use, which works fine for ioctl.
However, if I'm coming into the kernel over a netlink socket, I have no
obvious way of going from my table of devices to the processes that have
each one open, and I see no evidence that any other device driver tries
to do anything like this either.
Short of keeping a reference to the task_struct in the device, or
walking the sending process's file table if we receive a netlink message
(both of which are disgusting), I see no way to make this ioctl go away.
Am I missing something?
