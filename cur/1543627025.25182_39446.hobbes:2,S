This is because there are not a proper and correct state diagram data
handler set for ATAPI, period.  Initially the driver evolved out of PIO
calls to the PACKET_COMMAND opcode for the ATA command set.  Since there
has been zero updates/attempts to create a proper ATAPI/ASPI by anyone,
you can expect PIO transactions.
Who knows once I finally have taskfile completed and the kernel fixed to
not violate the basics of hardware atomic for storage devices, I may fix
all of the atapi/aspi transport.  It is a real mess to grunt through all
the docs.  However, I suspect I could get some help (co-author a
standard's proposal) with the original author to outline and create a 500+
page techincal referrence guide.  So if there are any companies want to
fund such an adventure, please let me know off-line.
Understand that only in PIO can you be sure of how much data you could get
from a device, argh it still s a pig in a poke.
