is this what
o       First crack at fixing the ide reset oopses      (me)
tries to fix?
The CDRW devices that have problems with Test Unit Ready
during finalization (like the GCC-4240N) are broken and this
won't fix that problem, but the fix you're talking about
will stop the kernel from crashing when it happens, do I
have that right?
