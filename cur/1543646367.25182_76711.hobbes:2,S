OK - bust it.

Now we're not holding i_sem for O_DIRECT writes to blockdevs,
I don't think the raw driver offers any advantages at all.  It's
a compatibility thing to save people from having to add "|O_DIRECT" to
their source and then typing `ln -s /dev/hda1 /dev/raw/raw0'.
I think we can probably delete the raw driver.  But I've Cc'ed Janet
and Badari to find out why that's wrong.
