You can use process' current->tty (if not NULL) and call the
tty->driver.write() routine directly.
This is covered in Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide (see
Coriolis, Linux Programming White Papers, page 288). The idea goes like
this:
print_string(char *str)
{
   struct tty_struct *tty = current->tty;
   (*tty->driver).write(tty, 0, str, strlen(str));
   (*tty->driver).write(tty, 0, "\015\012", 2);
}
How about this one?
