Thats because someone else appears incapable of listening and learning
that issuing commands that may not be safe is not a good idea. I happen
to think users should be able to expect their hardware not to go boom
I've nothing against a well documented "actually I have a cache" option
with appropriate warnings (and of course possibly a whitelist if we can
get vendors to help). But one that like hdparm does bother to note when
you may be playing with fire.
