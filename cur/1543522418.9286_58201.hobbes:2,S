Looks like i somehow never came around to answer you.  Well the real problem
with the IDE stuff is that it has started to affect totally unrelated parts
of the kernel:
1. ide-geometry is forced into the block device code unconditionally. That
   breaks all archs which don't know about IDE drives (and don't care: ever
   seen an Apollo Domain or an Mac-68k or an IBM S/390 with IDE drives? and
   sparc doesn't need it either, newer Ultra's have IDE but to my knowledge
   none of the older 32bit SPARCs).
   My suggestion: make it conditional on CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE...
2. linux/ide.h is included by fs/partitions/msdos.c. This breaks compilation
   also, because that requires asm-<arch>/hdreg.h which does not exist on all
   archs (but could if need should be).
So the problem is: keep the IDE stuff out of where it does not belong.
There you go...
