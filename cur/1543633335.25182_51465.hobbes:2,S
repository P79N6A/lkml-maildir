Where are you coming from with that comment?
  down(&semaphore);
  list_for_each(p, list)
    if (condition)
	list_del(p);
  up(&semaphore);
Should be completely SMP safe, or we have more serious problems than I
even imagined. And it worked just fine before the 'zero pointers in
list_del'-patch was included and is used in _at least_ two places in the
existing kernel, probably more.
And list_for_each_safe might work when list_del is zero-ing pointers,
but imho has an ugly interface, it still doesn't fix SMP issues. You
still need to prevent concurrent modifications, otherwise someone could
just as well remove the curr->next object and you corrupt/crash on
dereferencing the saved next pointer.
In fact this saved next pointer will far more likely to lead to obscure
and hard to debug crashes compared to leaving prev/next as they are in
the existing list_del function, just because people will think it is a
'safe' list iterator and forget about correctly locking their lists down.
