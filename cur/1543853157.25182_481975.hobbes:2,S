To be more precise, that is many distinct
criticisms from distinct people, some of which
contradict each other.
I know code is open to criticism,
but after several weeks of submitting patches
and getting no closer to acceptance I gave up.
We were going around in circles where one person
wanted some thing that conflicted with what
another person wanted.

There isn't much point in resubmitting the previously
rejected patches only to be rejected again.
I was planning on trying again in a month or two
to see if all the people who rejected all of the
previous patches have come to some sort of agreement.
Without such agreement we are left in the state
of never ending patches.
