That's the drive side verification of 80c cable check, so if the
condition triggers we downgrade 80c or unknown to 40c.  Cable detection
on nvidia PATA is a disaster.  You're supposed to do some ACPI dancing
and drive side detection is completely bogus.  Eeeek....
Alan, did you have a chance to test the ACPI cable detection?  It just
didn't work when I tried it.  It always returned 80c on my machine.
