Subject: [RFC][PATCH] ALSA: Remove subsystem-specific malloc (0/8)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/6/8/149

This patch introduces a kcalloc() and replaces ALSA magic allocator
snd_kcalloc() and snd_magic_kcalloc() with it.  I also fixed a memory
leak in the arm sa11xx driver and added a BUG() in seq_oss_synth to
catch failing allocations.
I kept the snd_magic_cast macro in place just in case someone wants to
add a generic type checking facility in the kernel and convert the users
to use it.
The patch is against 2.6.6 and was compile-tested with allyesconfig.
