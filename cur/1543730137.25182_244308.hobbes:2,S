I never said we should use simplified instructions everywhere there are
instructions. Hence I don't see why we care here about 1848 instructions
not beeing accessible. Most of thoses 1848 instructions probably fit in the
'not so much' used, and thus doesn't need a simplified mmenonic.

sure.
and some other prefer simplified instructions. I guess we're hitting a
wall here :)
But as clrrwi is already use in the kernel (as a lot of others simplified
instructions), either send a patch to remove them or don't say that this
is madness.

Maybe then you should rewrite all part of kernels, gcc, objdump and gdb that
use/disassemble the code with simplified instructions (mr, li, b*, etc...) too.
(clrrwi is as documented as mr)
