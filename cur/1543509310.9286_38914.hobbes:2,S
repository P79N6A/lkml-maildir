Sorry to bother you with this off-topic question guys, but I've been making
inquiries and noone yet seems to have a definitive answer for me.
I've already asked in one of the linux-ppc mailing lists, and no knew
anything for sure. Not a yes or a no, just maybes.
So, maybe one of you will, hoppefully, know.
Is there any linux kernel that boots on a IBM PowerPC RS6000 model 250
(7011 POWERstation) ?
and here's a link to the machine specifics.

I've been through PREP, CHRP, debian PPC and haven't yet found one that
works.
Thanks in advance,
Nuno
