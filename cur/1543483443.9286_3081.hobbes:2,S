Tried it on a 386 box with 110MB HD two years ago (2.0.x). I made the
necessary symlinks by hand until the compilation errors about missing
files disappeared. I can't remember wether I only did the config stage
or left the box compiling over night. The bottleneck was definitely
not the LAN or the server, but the limited RAM (5MB) and slow HD of
that box.
I can't check at the moment, according to my last infos that box has
been put out of service.
