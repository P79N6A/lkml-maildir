For the record, Petr found a solution for this one, too.
For whatever reason, xev gives the following for altgr (right alt) these
days:
    state 0x0, keycode 113 (keysym 0xfe03, ISO_Level3_Shift), same_screen YES,
                       ^^^
Adding 
  xkeymap.keycode.113 = 312
into /etc/vmware/config or into the per guest .cfg lets altgr work again
with vmware 3.2.1.
