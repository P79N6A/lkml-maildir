Hi Grigory,
it's unclear from your letter where you take pnx4008_uart_pm from. Can 
you please elaborate?
What I would think of if I were you is adding a field 'pm' to struct 
plat_serial8250_port which is filled in in the architecture-specific 
part and setting up->pm accrodingly.
I'll send a patch that may be of a help for you shortly.
Best regards,
   Vitaly
