Ehh.. Why do you thik we _have_ that PF_NOFREEZE thing in the first place?
Rafael, you really don't know what you're talking about, do you?
Just _look_ at them. It's the IO threads etc that shouldn't be frozen, 
exactly *because* they do IO. You claim that kernel threads shouldn't do 
IO, but that's the point: if you cannot do IO when snapshotting to disk, 
here's a damn big clue for you: how do you think that snapshot is going to 
get written?
I *guarantee* you that we've had a lot more problems with threads that 
should *not* have been frozen than with those hypothetical threads that 
you think should have been frozen.
