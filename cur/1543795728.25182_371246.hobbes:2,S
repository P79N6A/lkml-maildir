Yes, your patch looks good, and will fix some of the reports I've received.
However, after giving it some more thought, I believe my original
reasoning is probably incorrect.  Because if nvidiafb rejected the
mode timings, nvidiafb would not have loaded at all, but it did.
Which leads me to conclude that Calin's display EDID, specifically the
timing information, is totally garbage.
Calin, can you verify? Set CONFIG_FB_NVIDIA_I2C = y.
First, apply Linus' patch, then boot without any options.  If you get a
nice display, then my original reasoning is correct, and Linus' patch
is all we need.
Secondly, if you get a corrupt display after doing the above, then apply
my patch and boot without any options.  If you get a working display,
something is wrong with Linus' patch :-)  But most probably you'll also get
a corrupt display, so...
Finally, boot with video=nvidiafb:1600x1200MR@60.  If you reach this stage
and you get a working display, then the conclusion is that you have a
garbage EDID block :-).  And we will need both Linus' patch plus another
patch, perhaps a boot option that tells nvidiafb to totally ignore the
EDID block. (We don't want to disable the i2c bus because this is still
useful in userspace).
