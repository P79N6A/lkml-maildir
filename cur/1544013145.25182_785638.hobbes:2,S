Hi mkp.
netdev is the mailing list where the people that is interested
in networking hang out. 
Which is why I added them as receiver of your original mail.
When replying on either the linux-kernel or the netdev list
make sure to keep all cc: and to: adresses.
With the amount of traffic that are on these list this is needed.
