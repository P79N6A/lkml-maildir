A touch more info:
My current mobo is a FIC2013 (the atx version of the va503+), version 1,
with a Via VT82C598MVP, and my Flashpoint BT-950 has been working just fine,
24x7, for over a year; AMD k6-2/300.
I just bought a FIC2013 version 2 + AMD K6-2/475 (the version 1 board
doesn't support cpus that fast), and the system refuses to boot: I always
get a message similar to "blah blah IRQ 0", kernel panic, et. al.: the
code thinks the card is on irq 0.
My guy I get parts from just wasted a whole day at another place, claiming
that the Award Bios on the Asus mobos has been changed (Phoenix bought
Award) such that the "PnP OS" setting now does something different, etc.;
details are sketchy.  The point of that is that I've tried moving the card,
rearranging the order of cards, and changing all the bios settings, and I
see the same results.
Coupled with the fact that I lost *another* Seagate Cheetah, I may just go
to IDE :-(
Please Cc: me on any details you gentlemen discover - I can't parse the
volume of l-k ;-)
