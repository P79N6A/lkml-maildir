I am not sure what you like to do.....
But what you claim is simply impossible.
As you started to introduce the allegory with the colors, let me make 
an assumption based on your claim:
-	Buy two identical drives and varnish one in red and the other 
	in green.
-	Connect both drives to your computer to let the OS "learn" the
	drives.
-	Do any setup you like
-	Now disconnect the drives and after that, connect the green one
	the way the red one has been connected before. 
-	Connect the red one too.
-	Insert a medium into the green drive
-	Let your software try whether it is able to connect you
	to the green one.
If this always works as expected, then you are a magician!
So let me sum up: Never rely on things that cannot be made 100%
unique in case you like to run security relevent software like cdrecord.
