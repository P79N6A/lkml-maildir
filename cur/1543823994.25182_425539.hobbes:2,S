Working on this right now.  I've fixed the 4096 hard-coded page sizes
and made them work with PAGE_SIZE; the stack was fun, I had to use a
long_log2() and calculate how many page_random_bits were possible and
cut that out to see if any vma_random_bits were left and how many.  :)
I'm also looking at using STACK_RANDOM_BITS_MAX_X86 or something because
of IA-32 emulation on x86-64.  I definitely need to figure out how to
make that work cleanly; on x86-64 we may have more stack/heap entropy
than sane, and I'd rather limit that (at first; later comes--
confusion-- stack_random_bits32= mmap_random_bits32=).
While I'm at it, does anyone see anything else glaring I should fix?  (I
am actually trying to get this merged, yes...)
