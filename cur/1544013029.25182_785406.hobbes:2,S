Subject: [PATCH 1/5] regulator: Remove extraneous kerneldoc annotations
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/31/110

Some of the internal structures have no kerneldoc but the ** at the start
of the comment marking them for documentation.  Remove the annotation
until some is added.
