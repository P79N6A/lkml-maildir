Lee, the last time I saw this discussion I thought it was identified that 
the multiple cores (or IIRC the multiple chips in a SMP motherboard) would 
only get out of sync when power management calls were made (hlt or 
switching the c-state). IIRC the workaround that was posted then was to 
just disable these in the kernel build.
if this is the case then I could easily see the hardware engineers 
thinking that if the software did a sleep thing then it was up to the 
software to re-sync the TSC clocks when the wakeup takes place.

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
