Pre-allocation sound like a very probably reason to me, it least if the
problem was related to streaming multiple files simultaneously, or even
streaming to a disk containing other files. How to avoid fragmentation
otherwise? (In the case of this kind of applications, a small fragment
is a few hundred kB...)
