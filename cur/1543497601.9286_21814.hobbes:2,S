Hi,
I am trying to use the IP-router alert option to capture UDP packets that
are marked with this option in the IP header in a Linux box configured as
a router. I am not sure how to attack this problem. could someone who has 
worked with this before throw some light on how to use this option or give
some pointers to documentation available on usage.I have gone through RFC
2113. Thanks a lot.
Regards,
Hormuzd.
