We certainly run this kind of tests on a routine basis - before we ship 
a kernel to our installed field, we need to verify that it will handle 
disk IO errors correctly.
In our case, the tests are run on a farm of machines that get pxe'ed to 
a specific image, tested (usually by sticking in a disk known to be bad 
enough to cause reliable errors ;-)) and then we watch to see that the 
errors do not cause hangs, etc.
Having a requirement to change our standard image (sda -> 
stacked-driver) would not be impossible, but would be less convenient...
