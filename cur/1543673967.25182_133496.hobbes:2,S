Thanks for the work.
I've yet to read carefully each change (will do this week-end), but I 
agree on the principles.
The only thing that disturbed me was the removal of the DEBUG code (as 
it often helped me find out bugs and understand new chips' behavior) but 
I think it's best for me to maintain a patch which adds this code in the 
very rare cases where it can be usefull.
