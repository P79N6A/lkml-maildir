I've got a PCI serial card here that I'm not sure how to add support
for.  It's resource map is like this:
Product name   | Ven.ID | Dev.ID |[Base+10]|[Base+14]|[Base+18]|[Base+20]|
---------------+--------+--------+---------+---------+---------+---------+
VScom PCI-400L |  14D2  |  8040  |         | Uart #1 | Uart #2 | Uart 3,4|
VScom PCI-800L |  14D2  |  8080  |         | Uart #1 | Uart #2 | Uart 3-8|
(UARTs 3 onwards are spaced 8 bytes apart.) In other words, two of the
400L's ports would be encoded like this:
{ PCI_VENDOR_..., PCI_DEVICE_..., PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID,
  SPCI_FL_BASE_1 | SPCI_FL_BASE_TABLE, 2, 921600 },
but the other two would be described by:
{ PCI_VENDOR_..., PCI_DEVICE_..., PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID,
  SPCI_FL_BASE_3, 2, 921600 },
and I can't seem to find a way of supporting both lots at once.
Similarly, for the 800L I can only support up to six of the eight
ports at once.
Is there a trick I can use, or doesn't this kind of thing work yet?
(I'm looking at 2.4 for this.)
Tim.
