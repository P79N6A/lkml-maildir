Well, the numbers paint a different picture than your pervious

loss in interactive performance.

A full dmesg would be better.  Right now I have no idea what kind
of aic7xxx controller you are using, the speed and type of CPU,
the chipset in the machine, etc. etc.  In general, I'd rather see
the raw data than a version edited down based on the conclusions
you've already drawn or on what you feel is important.

Were both tests performed from cold boot to a new file in the same
directory with similar amounts of that filesystem in use?

It doesn't matter how simple it is if you've never mentioned it before.
Your tone is somewhat indignant.  Do you not understand why this
data is important to understanding and correcting the problem?

Send me a c1010. 8-)

What is the interrupt load during these tests?  Have you verified that
disconnection is enabled for all devices on the aic7xxx controller?

Since you are experiencing the problem, can't you time it?  There is
little guarantee that I will be able to reproduce the exact scenario
you are describing.  As I mentioned before, I don't have a c1010,
so I cannot perform the comparison you feel is so telling.
This does not look like an interrupt latency problem.
