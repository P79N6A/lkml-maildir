I don't know what your problem with the Promise driver is, but
my experience is the opposite. I have never had any problems with
the 2.4 (or 2.2 + Andre's IDE patch) pdc202xx driver and my
Ultra100 (20267) card, which sits in a 24/7 News server and
receives, stores, and sends many gigabytes of data between reboots.
(And it's only rebooted once a month or so because I prefer using
uptodate kernels. Currently running 2.4.19-pre9.)
