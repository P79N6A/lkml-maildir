Subject: [PATCH 5/5] lumpy: only check for valid pages when holes are present
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/27/235

We only need to check that each page is valid with pfn_valid when
we are on an architecture which had holes within zones.  Make this
check conditional.
