No, because the first requirement for 'volatile' in my paragraph above is 
restricted to clobbering specific hard registers and an operand cannot 
describe a hard register for a member when that register appears in the 
clobber list.  If an input operand is modified (i.e. not "accessed", 
rather "modified" inclusive of the case where the previous value is the 
same as the original value) then it must also be specified as an output 
operand.
Now if all such output operands are to specify that the input operands 
were "modified", 'volatile' is required to ensure the side-effects are 
preserved or, otherwise, gcc is free optimize the entire asm construct 
away since it appears to be unused.

You're point about reordering "asm volatile" constructs differs depending 
on -mvolatile-asm-stop or -mno-volatile-asm-stop, however.
