I have a SpeedStream 1012 cardbus ethernet card, which seems to be
indicated as a supported tulip cardbus device.  However, tulip_core.c in
2.4.20 (and several other kernels I tried while working with this card)
don't have the PCI IDs for the card, vendor 0x02ac, device 0x1012.  
When I patch tulip.o to attach to this card, this is the result:
cs: cb_free(bus 21)
cs: cb_alloc(bus 21): vendor 0x02ac, device 0x1012
PCI: Enabling device 15:00.0 (0000 -> 0003)
PCI: 15:00.0 PCI cache line size set incorrectly (0 bytes) by BIOS/FW,
correcting to 32
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 15:00.0 to 64
tulip1: Old style EEPROM with no media selection information.
eth0: Digital DS21143 Tulip rev 16 at 0xd1067000, EEPROM not present,
00:10:7A:69:1F:1C, IRQ 11.
At this point, the '10M' LED glows orange (normal is green) regardless
of the type of link that is attached to the card.  No traffic gets
through the interface. 
Where can I start to get this card going ?
Thanks in advance.
