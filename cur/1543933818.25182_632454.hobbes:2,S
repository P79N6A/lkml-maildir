For this kind of patch (converting a semaphore to a mutex), it is
necessary to see everywhere that changes.  There's no way to tell if what
he's doing is safe without seeing all the places that have to change,
and verifying whether it breaks any of the rules in include/linux/mutex.h
For other kinds of patches, you could well be right.
