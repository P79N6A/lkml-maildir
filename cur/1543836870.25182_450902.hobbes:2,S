At this point the disk may parked and its queue frozen, and may depend
on the keyboard/mouse activity to be released. So hdapsd mustn't do
anything that involves potential swapping or userspace with unlocked
memory, and the input infrastructure is too large and flexible for
such a guarantee. I guess this is why IBM provided this low-level hook
at the embedded controller level.
