You need to be using this patch if you have Intel hardware,
and users with VIA hardware will be significantly happier:

It was also posted to linux-usb-users, and is in the queue
of fixes I hope will be merged into the next 2.4.21pre patch.
I got a fair amount of feedback from folk using this patch;
as expected, it's better all around.
