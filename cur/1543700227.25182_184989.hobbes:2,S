I have converted dongle drivers on disk here. So far I was holding back 
basically due to:
* 2.6.0 freeze
* neither hardware nor testers to do even basic validation
* wait for tx-lock and rawmode fixes to get applied first so we would 
  hopefully get some more feedback and trust in the infrastructure.
If you would like to accept it now I'd sent patches this weekend.

Yes, tekram-sir is reportedly working now with those patches.

After some user provided helpful information off-list I found out it gets 
triggered when the app doesn't close the ircomm-fd before exiting.
Just do "cat /dev/ircomm0" and kill -9 the cat to see.
Below my current experimental patch. It works for me and I've got an user
confirmation meanwhile. It's definedly an improvement and I do think it is 
as safe as we can get without reworking the whole ircomm-locking...
