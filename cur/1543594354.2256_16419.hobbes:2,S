Because of you can move mouse cursor - moving mouse usually does not
have serious side effect. Normal cursor cannot be moved without
sideeffects, so you cannot find it so easy.
If you want, just plug matrox into your laptop and use matroxfb. It
restarts cursor blinking cycle on each character printed to screen,
so while you are typing, you still see cursor, but if you stop typing,
cursor starts blinking...
Just my 0.02Kc.

[matroxfb has also noblink option because HPA wanted it. But it is
another story]
