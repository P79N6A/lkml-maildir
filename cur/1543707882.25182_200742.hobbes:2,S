Hi there,
i created that a few days ago and thought someone might find an interest in
it.
It's a hotfix against the recent mremap bug (missing returnvalue check of
do_munmap()) and can be compiled/loaded as kernelmodule.
It doesn't permit to create more than 60000 VMAs (the default max is 65535).
Can be downloaded here:

best regards,
nolife
