Hi,
Is there a way to lock a particular portion of the memory pages during
kernel bootup? I want to re-use these pages when I load my
application. I *don't* wanna use the idea of reserving some physical
memory and using ioremap. I want something that kernel should be able
to manage this memory but I don't want any other application to use
this memory.
Thanks in advance
Sreeni
