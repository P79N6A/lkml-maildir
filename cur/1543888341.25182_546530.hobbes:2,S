  is there some understood standard for naming header files related to
IPv6?  currently, there are header files that start with any one of
"ip6_", "ipv6_" and "ip6t_" (although the latter looks like it's
specifically for netfilter stuff).
  is there meant to be a distinction between prefixes of "ipv6_" and
"ip6_"?
