You I suspect will. When the machine resumes it likes to re-enable the mouse
pad irrespective of whether it is being used - so you get an IRQ12. Even
more fun if you ignore that IRQ you dont get keyboard events because the
microcontroller (or SMM code impersonating it - who knows these days) is
waiting for the ps/2 event to be handled first.
The alternative (possibly cleaner) fix on those machines would be to turn
the PS/2 port on always and process/discard output if its not wanted by
the user
