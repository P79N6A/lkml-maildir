Well, I'm happy to report that it not only built, it booted, and that 
the one program thats been a noshow for video, tvtime, in any kernel 
newer than -rc1, failing in all the . releases after .2, or any -mm I 
tried, is working quite nicely thank you in -rc2.  Its late, and I'll 
check the rest of my checklist in the morning.
-rc1 was one heck of an improvement in feel and usability, I hope -rc2 
will continue that tradition.  Great stuff.
