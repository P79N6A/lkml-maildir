Let me rephrase that because it sounds horrible: From my reading of
spinlocks.txt, it's "only when the spinlock isn't toyed with in an
interrupt context" that the non-irq versions can be used ... How can I
tell if I'm in an interrupt context when, for example,
drivers/video/cgsixfb.c: cg6_putcs() is called?
Thanks.
