The FSSTND, Debian,Red Hat, SuSE etc follow the System 5 tradition, there
is a script for each program. That makes package management a lot simpler
because you can add/delete files with a fair amount of control compared to
making installers edit rc.M (memories of programs patching autoexec.bat).
Th Slackware style rc files come from the older SunOS/BSD tradition.
