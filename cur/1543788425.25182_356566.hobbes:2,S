 it is advocated that storing data in text format is easier
 to recover with a minimum of tools.
 if, as todd sabin's driver shows, you can present the binary data via a
 text-editable filesystem driver, then even _that_ argument goes away.

 reiserfs already has had an XML plugin written for it, which resulted
 in the person it was written for thanking the author for writing the
 "best xml database they had ever seen".
 think structured storage and streams (which NTFS used to support, and
 which explorer.exe in nt 3.51 used to support before
 bill/someone-on-high ordered it to be taken out) and now apply that
 principle to XML instead.

 i would be delighted to see #ifdef HAVE_L4_MICROKERNEL #endif in the
 linux source code.
 AS AN OPTION.
 that people could choose "bugger that damn l4 trash" or "bugger that
 monolithic trash" as they see fit.
 and the l4linux source code _is_ there for the linux kernel developers
 to pick up and incorporate.
 that they have not chosen to do so - even though it is GPL code -
 leaves me a little puzzled.

  ah _ha_.
  as a hardware engineer, what would _you_ like to see a
  modern parallel processor design have - that linux for that
  hardware would have an easy job of knocking the stuffing
  out of anything remotely attempting to come close to it?
  i.e. if you could have the proverbial cart before the
  proverbial horse, and could make decisions about the DESIGN
  of hardware - all of it - BEFORE it was dumped in your lap
  and you were basically impicitly told "we're giving you
  this for free and taking advantage of your willingness to go
  'cool hardware!  let's make it run linux".
  we've already had one suggestion: a CAS-n instruction (a SIMD
  compare-and-store) which can, according to the person who kindly
  suggested it, be used for managing doubly-linked lists.
  anyone got any more?
  want to send them to me, and i will summarise to those people that
  express an interest.
  [i _so_ want this thread to die].

 even _decoding_ the x86 instruction set, due to the massive
 number of exceptions / extensions, introduces significant
 instruction latency.
 a large amount of an x86 compatible processor is spent
 translating that crap into a simpler _internal_ microcode set
 of instructions.
 unberfrigginlievable.
 oh, these instructions are too slow.  _let's_ go an' add multimedia
 extensions.  *noooooooo.*
