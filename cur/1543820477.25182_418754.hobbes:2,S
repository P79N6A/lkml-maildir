It seems that your kernel is doing something different from the code I
have in front of me.

Card inserted - okay.

Card told to go to idle state - okay.

Sent MMC_APP_CMD, got told "OCR busy" - this is bogus.  APP_CMD does _not_
return an OCR.  No idea why your OMAP host thinks it does.
Nevertheless, we have a zero response, but the card _did_ apparantly
respond.  So we decide APP commands aren't supported.

We send a CMD1 to probe for the OCR.  Get zero back.  Zero back from a card
means "I don't support any voltage what so ever", so...

We power down.
