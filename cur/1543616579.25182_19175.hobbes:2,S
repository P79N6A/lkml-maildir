There are actually three to five individual files used as part of the
equation.  qmail stores each message as three our four individual files
while it is in the queue (which for local deliveries is very briefly).
In addition, each delivered message is saved as an individual file,
until the client picks it up (and deletes it) with POP.

Agreed.  Free RAM is wasted RAM.  However, when adding up the numbers
buffers+cache+RSS+slab,  the totals I am reading account for roughly
half of the used RAM:
	RSS	 84MB (including shared pages counted multiple times)
	slabs	 82MB
	buffers	154MB
	cache	152MB
	-------------
	total	477MB
However, free reports 895MB as used.  What am I missing?

The names in the queue are actually reused fairly frequently.  qmail
creates an initial file named for the creating PID, and then renames it
to the inode number of the file.  These inode numbers are of course
recycled as are the filenames.

I'd love to test this as well, but this is a production server.  I'll
see if I can put one of my home systems to the task.
