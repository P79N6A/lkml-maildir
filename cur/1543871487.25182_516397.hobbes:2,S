i'm still arguing the same: that doing the same thing via overlapping, 
conflicting, redundant ABIs is crazy and contrary to the basic interests 
of Linux. It's like having 5 different, parallel variants of sys_open(), 
interfaced via a convoluted open_ops.
having data ABI coupling is one thing (filesystems, network formats, 
etc.). But having a 5-way function ABI coupling between system software 
running on the /same piece of hardware/, doing the same thing in essence 
is just madness in my book.
