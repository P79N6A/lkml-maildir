There is a similar problem reported by s390 people where we see parent
kobject (directory) going away before child kobject (sub-directory). It
seems kobject code is able to handle this, but not the sysfs. What could
be happening that in sysfs_remove_dir() of parent directory, we try to
remove its contents. It works well with the regular files as it is the
final removal for sysfs_dirent corresponding to the files. But in case
of sub-directory we are doing an extra sysfs_put().  Once while removing
parent and the other one being the one from when sysfs_remove_dir() is
called for the child.
The following patch worked for the s390 people, I hope same will work in
this case also.
o Do not remove sysfs_dirents corresponding to the sub-directory in
  sysfs_remove_dir(). They will be removed in the sysfs_remove_dir() call
  for the specific sub-directory.
