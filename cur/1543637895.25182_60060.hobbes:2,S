We need measurements for a few other loads I think.

Yes, that's better.

We'd have to hold the lock while changing the page->index.  Pte_chain_lock
would additionally have to check the page->index after acquiring the lock
and, if changed, drop it and take the new one.  I don't think the overhead 
for this check is significant.
Add_to_page_cache would want new flavor that shortens up the pte chain lock 
hold time, but it looks like it should have a swap-specific variant anyway.
