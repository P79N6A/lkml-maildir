It is black and white in copyright law and the GPL.
The /whole point/ of the GPL is to funnel contributions back.
We happen to think there are solid engineering reasons for this. 
Customers think there are solid reasons for this. Libre activists think 
there are freedom aspects to this.
But ignoring all the justifications, it /is/ the letter of the law.  And 
you are expected to follow it, just like everybody else.
