Hi Andrzej,
Your patch puts the stuff back (essentially) to how it used to be. Here is
the extract from the very original BFS patch of ages ago:
+if [ "$CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL" = "y" ]; then
+   tristate 'BFS filesystem (read only) support (EXPERIMENTAL)'
CONFIG_BFS_FS
+   if [ "$CONFIG_BFS_FS" != "n" ]; then
+      bool '  BFS filesystem write support (DANGEROUS)'
CONFIG_BFS_FS_WRITE
+   fi
+fi
So, since someone modified it to use dep_bool perhaps they had a reason to
do so? There is no point to change A -> B and then B -> A, I thought?
Regards.
