How much too fat? I thought it wasn't an issue. I thought it could be an
issue on a machine with 4Mbyte of phys RAM but I thought it was not an
issue on rasonable new hardware.

I noticed that was a pain to call from fs.h any `extern inline' functions
implemented in swap.h ;)

Agreed, better to do the work in shrink_dcache(). Once you shrunk the
dcache you can free also the inodes that was attached to the freed
dentries (if I understand right how the dcache works).
