Hello everyone,
HP has most graciously donated a pair of DL585 quad Opteron servers
with 24 GB of RAM and 10 TB of disk using a pair of MSA-30 arrays for
each server.  The first ones of these servers was officially put in
service today; the next one will be put in service next week.  Each
server is in a different ISC colo, connected to the Internet via
gigabit fiber links.
Consequently, we should now see incredibly much better performance
from kernel.org.  Huge thanks to HP for the new hardware, and huge
thanks to ISC for letting us quadruple our rack space requirements
from 5U to 2x10U.  We'll be saturating those links in no time :)
