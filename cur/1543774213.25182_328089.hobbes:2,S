I could provide some help here, by providing the schematics and firmware 
for having a microcontroller do the pulse timing part. The schematics 
should be extremely simple, and easy to build in a breadboard (no 
soldering required) with standard parts from electronics resellers.
With a hardware solution we could measure the *actual* target latency 
with sub-microsecond accuracy, and do some fun stuff too, like 
triggering the pulse at random intervals in a given range, etc.
The microcontroller would then connect to the logger (or the HOST in 
your setup, and avoid an extra computer) through a serial port to report 
the measurements.
Is this something that could be useful, or do you think this is just 
overkill?
