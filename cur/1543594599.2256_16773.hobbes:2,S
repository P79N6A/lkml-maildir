Concerning the new way initrd works in 2.4...
I'm trying to get the system to the point where I can free the memory
used by the initrd.  I'm quite well aware of how to do this in a bash
script, but I want to know how to do the same from a C program.
Currently, something's keeping /dev/ram0 busy, so I know I'm doing
something wrong.
