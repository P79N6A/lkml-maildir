The real issue is that it was not Plan 9 semantics to start with.
See 9/port/devproc.c and 9/port/devdup.c; the former is procfs and
while it does have <pid>/fd, the sucker is not a directory - it's
a text file containing (more or less) the pathnames of opened files
of that process.  The latter is an entirely different thing - it's
a separate filesystem (#d instead of #p, FWIW).  There you have
per-descriptor files to open and yes, that'll give you dup().  What
you do not have there is per-process part.
IOW, you can get pathnames of opened files for other processes via
procfs *AND* you can get open-that-does-only-dup for files in your
descriptor table - on a separate filesystem.
1.2 tried to mix both.  I'm not actually sure that it was a good idea wrt
security, while we are at it...
We could implement Plan 9 style dupfs, but to do that without excessive
ugliness we'd need to change prototype of ->open() - it must be able to
return a reference to struct file different from anything it got from
caller; probably the least painful way would be to make it return
	NULL => success, use struct file passed to ->open()
	ERR_PTR(-err) => error
	pointer to struct file => success, caller should drop the
reference to struct file it had passed to ->open() and use the return value.
Still a mind-boggling amount of churn - probably too much to bother with.
PS: from Plan 9 proc(3) [they use section 3 for kernel filesystems]:
      The read-only fd file lists the open file descriptors of the process.
      The first line of the file is its current directory; subsequent lines
      list, one per line, the open files, giving the decimal file descriptor
      number; whether the file is open for read (r), write, (w), or both (rw);
      the type, device number, and qid of the file; its I/O unit (the amount
      of data that may be transferred on the file as a contiguous piece; see
      iounit(2)), its I/O offset; and its name at the time it was opened.
