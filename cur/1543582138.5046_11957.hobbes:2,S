That's not the behaviour I'm testing, but whether the CPU is doing
lock
pte = *ptep
if (present && writable)
	pte |= dirty
*ptep = pte
unlock
versus
lock
pte = *ptep
pte |= dirty
*ptep = pte
unlock
Which can be tested by means of getting the pte into the tlb then changing
the pte without flushing and observing the results (page fault vs changed
pte).  I'm willing to bet that all cpus are doing the first version.
