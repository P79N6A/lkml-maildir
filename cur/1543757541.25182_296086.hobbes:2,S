See what drivers/base/dmapool.c tells you; yes that
consumption can be derived from the pool statistics.

I suggest you get rid of the spaces in those names, to make it
easier to use things like "awk" to massage those numbers.  The
"ohci1394" is implied by the fact that no other driver could
be bound to that device, for example.
In this case, other than the fact that you've created multiple
pools with the same names (!), that line translates to 16 blocks
in use out of 256 available, 16 bytes per block, just one page.
I suspect that on some systems it should be bumping up the minimum
block size to match the CPU cacheline size.
