Agreed.
So, Kernel Janitor folks, here is a good line for the TODO:
"Convert GNU C-style named initializers to C99 named initializers"
And:
"Where the end result is cleaner and more maintainable, convert unnamed
initializers to C99-style named initializers. In almost all cases, named
initializers are safer and less ambiguous, but in some cases the
resulting change is large and unwieldy. Exercise judgment."
