Hello,
I'm trying to write a UDEV rule, which has to hand over the SCSI device 
ID in the format $HOST:$CHANNEL:$ID:$LUN to a shellscript.
My first try was:
ATTR{vendor}=="XXXX", ATTR{model}=="XXXX", SUBSYSTEM=="scsi", 
ACTION=="add", PROGRAM+="/usr/bin/test.sh %b %p"
This returns the SCSI device ID and the device path up to the SCSI 
device to my test script.
As I would prefer to use the USB device information (idVendor, 
idProduct) to detect the device, I also tried this one:
ATTRS{idVendor}=="0dda", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2005", SUBSYSTEM=="scsi", 
ACTION=="add", PROGRAM+="/usr/bin/test.sh %b %p"
Now this version returns the USB device ID ($NUM-$NUM) to the test 
script, but the device path (%p) is still OK and still goes down up to 
the SCSI device ID.
Why does %b not return the SCSI device ID in the second rule?
Thanks in advance
Yours
Manuel
