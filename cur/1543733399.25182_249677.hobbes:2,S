Hello,
      Let me explain the requirement a little more in detail.
Consider the routine sleep_on_timeout(, timeout) in sched.c:
A timer is started and then schedule() is called. The timer expires
after present jiffies + timeout (in jiffies) period.
On  x86 the jiffies is updated every time PIT raises interrupt and
do_timer() is called, i.e. once in every 10ms.
So we can set timeout in multiples of 10ms. 
We are developing a very powerful system (not x86 based) with multiple
CPUs, one of them will be running linux and will act as a co-processor
for the other CPUs running different OS.
On the CPU running linux we need to be able to call sleep_on_timeout()
with more granular expiration time, may be in multiples of microseconds.
I already have done the investigation and looking for feedback from the
developers on all possible issues.
Hope this explains.
Thanks,
Kallol Biswas
