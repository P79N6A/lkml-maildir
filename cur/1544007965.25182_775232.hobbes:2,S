Okay, how does gpio_set/get_values_batch() sound?

Okay, so I'll also add gpio_direction_output/input_batch and request/free_batch.

Ok, CONFIG_GPIOLIB_BATCH and I'll add this code in
drivers/gpio/gpiolib_batch.c. I hope I have understood that suggestion
correctly.

Okay, I read above several times and I read Documentation/gpio.txt.
But... I'm not confident I've understood your meanings above in terms
of how it should change the code. What I know so far is:
a)
arch/arm/mach-pxa/include/mach/gpio.h is where the pxa GPIO api
interface is defined. So that's where I will put the
gpio_get/set_values_batch functions. This will match the existing
gpio_set/get_value code there.
b)
arch/arm/mach-pxa/gpio.c is where the implementation is.
So I'll put the pxa_gpio_direction_input/output_batch and
pxa_gpio_set/get_batch there.
c)
drivers/gpio/gpiolib_batch.c
This is where I'd put the generic platform independent implementations
of __gpio_set/get_values_batch
Does this sound consistent with your recommendation? If not, I need
more help to understand what changes you are recommending.

Yes, I completely agree that it must work on a wide range of
architectures. But I don't understand what you mean when you say get
the lowest level proposal out there first. I see the RFC code that I
posted as being the lowest level proposal (albeit needing better name
and bitmask support) and one that is sufficiently general that it can
be implemented on other architectures. If it can't, can you help me
understand by pointing to which portion would break on other archs?
Thanks,
