Subject: Trivial patch: linux-2.5.50/fs/read_write.c contained unnecessary assignment in do_readv_writev

Hi Al,
	I'm not sure if you are the right person to send this
to.  If there is a more appropriate person to send this patch
to, feel free to redirect me.
	The following patch deletes an unncessary assignment
in do_readv_writev.  I've widened the patch context to make it
clear that the assignment was being overwritten immediately,
regardless of the result of the "if" statement that follows it.
	If this patch looks OK, can you please forward it to Linus?
If you'd rather I send this down some other path to Linus, please let
me know.
