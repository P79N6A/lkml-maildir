Umph, that sounds a bit generic. Network cards are sometimes referred
to as "network [card] adapter" and graphic cards to as "graphics adapter",
so by your suggestions, they would all go into drivers/adapters/.
When such a driver actually comes along, we can revisit the topic.

Please not. Either character-based devices or sysfs files, depending
on which flies best. Adapters are not really proc-related.
