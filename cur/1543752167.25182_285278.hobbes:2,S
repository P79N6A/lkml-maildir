Hmm, no it is not the case. The deamon application would start from the
boot. It only keeps the list of candidates whenever you're getting
close to red zone.
There is no deadlock.
Deamon just started at user space, and does only calculation. It doesn't
take decision at all. That OOM killer at kernel level who get the list
and chooses
who to shoot dead.

Could be. Interesting idea. We shall keep thinking about it. Have you done
some experiment like that?

Yes, agreed. Our point was just to re-organize current OOM killer to release the
kernel from doing rating, which is not its task any way.
