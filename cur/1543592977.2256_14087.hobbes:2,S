Great stuff. May I suggest adding -k to the cscope cmdline:
> +	cscope -b -I include
should become 
  +	cscope -b -k -I include
Also, I think you should separate cscope.files creation into a different
rule,
and make the cscope target depend on it and on the files in it. (Like the
stuff
with .flags)
The new .files should be created  in a different file, and the old file
shouldn't 
be replaced if there's no change.
Lastly, you need to clean up. I think cscope.out should be cleaned up
in the clean target, while the cscope.files should probably should only be
cleaned on rmproper or such.
