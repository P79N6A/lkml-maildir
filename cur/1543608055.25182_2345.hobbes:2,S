Well, with eepro100 the start may be the following:
1. When the card stalls, start ping from that host.
This way you ensure that you have something in transmit ring.
If it's transmitting that stalls, you'll get a message from netdev watchdog.
2. If ping works, then your problem appear to be pure NFS one, i.e. inability
of NFS to recover from network operation disruption.
3. If ping is able to transmit, but not receive (you may check it by
tcpdump), then we have a receiver problem.
We'll think what to do then.
4. In any case, running eepro100-diag from scyld.com at the moment of the
stall may give some useful information.
5. In any case, searching eepro100 mailing list archive on scyld.com is a
good idea, you may learn what other people observe/do.
