Thanks.  I've incorporated this patch plus some modifications to the 
Zaphod scheduler to take advantage of the TASK_NONINTERACTIVE flag into 
v-5.2 of PlugSched for 2.6.11, 2.6.12-rc6 and 2.6.12-rc6-mm1 kernels. 
Patches to upgrade v-5.1 to v-5.2 are available at:

I noticed when doing this conversion that I had botched the propagation 
of your staircase 11.2 patches into the 2.6.12-rc6-mm1 kernel and anyone 
using the staircase scheduler in that kernel is advised to upgrade to 
this patch.
