The following "sleep under spinlock" is still present as of linux
2.6.12.5 in sound/oss/sequencer.c in midi_outc:
        n = 3 * HZ;             /* Timeout */
        spin_lock_irqsave(&lock,flags);
        while (n && !midi_devs[dev]->outputc(dev, data)) {
                interruptible_sleep_on_timeout(&seq_sleeper, HZ/25);
                n--;
        }
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&lock,flags);
I haven't thought about it, just noted it. It's been there forever
(some others in the sound architecture have been gradually disappearing
as newer kernels come out).
This code found during an analysis of about 1.5 million lines of kernel
code by the static kernel code analyser at
   
ftp://oboe.it.uc3m.es/pub/Programs/c-1.2.
*.tgz
(and yes, I am the author - if anyone wants to help please contact me).
