I have a shared library of commands for wrapping kernel functions like
open, close,
read & write.  When the open command is called I return a user defined
file handle
and I want to be able to recognise this file handle later when the read
or write is called.
How do I allocate memory in a shared library and refer to it later?
Is there any way to keep the data/bbs segments of the shared library in
memory
and refer to them later?
