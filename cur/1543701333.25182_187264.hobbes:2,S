From filemap_fdatawait:
while (!list_empty(&mapping->locked_pages)) {
                struct page *page;
                                                                                
                page = list_entry(mapping->locked_pages.next,struct page,list);
                list_del(&page->list);
                if (PageDirty(page))
                        list_add(&page->list, &mapping->dirty_pages);
                else
                        list_add(&page->list, &mapping->clean_pages);
                                                                                
---->           if (!PageWriteback(page)) {
		                        if (++progress > 32) {
                                if (need_resched()) {
                                        spin_unlock(&mapping->page_lock);
                                        __cond_resched();
                                        goto restart;
                                }
                        }
---->                  continue;
                }
	
If PG_writeback is not set, it moves on to process the next page -- without
falling through to wait_on_page_writeback, isn't that so ? 
Another thread could have pulled the page off io_pages, put it on locked
pages, and not set PG_writeback as yet.
How does the page lock guard against this ? 
filemap_fdatawait seems to ignore the page lock.
