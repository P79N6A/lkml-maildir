Thanks for the reply Alan, much appreciated.
This system is running on Uniprocessor Intel P III's or Celerons (a 
variety of clock speeds) with  either 256 or 512Mb of memory and no swap 
(another experiment).  The Serial Hardware is a proprietary card (with a 
driver to cope with that, mostly copied from the standard serial driver) 
giving us the 240 serial lines.  I can give more detail on that and the 
driver if necessary.
Just offhand I have been through my  driver (with others making 
comments/suggestions) a few times to see if it's all my fault (which it 
may well still be).  The reason I know interrupts are still running is 
that on every interrupt I stick a different value onto the Parallel port 
and can see those changing as I would expect even when the system is 
locked up otherwise.
I am considering 2.4.19 but haven't had a chance to test with the 
driver/hardware yet.  That will be soon as it seems a good path to go down.
One thing I forgot was that there was the same failure with a system 
running without the squid.  It seems though, that a system running 
without squid will fail less often (two or more weeks between failures 
as opposed to a few days).
I hope I'm giving enough detail to be useful here.
Bill
