my patch, my fault, sorry. I mistakenly assumed vaddr to be a kernel address.
however, the previous code was
        if (MAP_NR(page) >= max_mapnr)
                return 0;
which is also bogus. if the intention is to detect if it's outside "struct
page *" memory, then
	if (page - mem_map >= max_mapnr)
		return 0;
makes more sense.
