I think we just need an additional method in struct fb_ops. Something like 
this:
unsigned char *fb_get_edid(struct fb_info *info)
{
	if (info->fbops->fb_get_edid)
		return info->fbops->fb_get_edid(info);
	else 
		return fallback_get_edid_method();
}
We can get the EDID by different methods:
1. User uploads EDID to kernel via an ioctl.  This is always preferred,
as it gives the user the power to override machine settings, or if there
is no other method to get the EDID.  We can also have a userland utility
that encodes user-specified monitor information and modelines into EDID
info (a reverse EDID parser).  For instance, selected entries in
/etc/fb.modes can be easily converted to EDID which the user can upload
to fbdev.
2. Gets it through device-specific hooks (i2c, whatever), if available. 
This is second choice, as it can get the EDID anytime.  This is useful
when a user decides to change monitors without rebooting, or if the
device is a non-primary display.
3.  Some architecture specific methods, such as doing it via the BIOS. 
This is the last choice, our fallback method. as this EDID may be static
and represents only the display detected at boot time.
For supplementary functions, we also need some kind of control that
allows the user to tell fbdev "I've switched monitors, please reread the
EDID". We want to avoid doing DDC each time fbdev does an fb_set_var(),
especially for DDC1 which can be very slow. 
Also, a way to download the EDID from kernel to userland.
