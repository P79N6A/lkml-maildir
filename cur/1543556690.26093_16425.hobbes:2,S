First of all, I tested removing the "or $2" in hpa's patch.
That made resume work. Then, putting back the "or" but removing the
"and $0xfe" had no effect at all (i.e. resume -> reboot).
I suppose not setting bit 1 made fast A20 enable not succeed, so kbc A20
was used -> resume works fine.
With setting bit 1 and with or w/o clearing bit 0, fast A20 enable seems
to succeed -> kbc A20 is not used -> resume reboots.

I suppose I'ld loose that bet.

Makes sense to me.
test12-pre6 now works perfectly :-)
