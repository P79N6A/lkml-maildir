Ehh, I think every filesystem must have that bug, since fill_super AFAIK
is expected to initialize the root dentry (sb->s_root), or at least that
is what the function used to do before it became 'fill_super'.
When I saw this bugreport I immediately knew that Coda did the same
thing "wrong". Let's see,
    ext2/ext3, iget in fill_super
    reiserfs,  iget5_locked in fill_super
    ramfs,     new_inode in fill_super
There probably isn't a reason to keep looking further at this point...
I think logically if a filesystem needs to perform any setup before it
can handle VFS request that should probably be done in the registered
get_sb function before that function then calls back into the VFS to get
the actual superblock with get_sb_dev/nodev/single(..., fill_super).
Not sure how realistic this thought is, since we don't have an
initialized superblock at this time to hang things off of.

This sounds like a better solution, although filesystems might have to
handle some operations earlier than they currently expect.
