You optimist!
A standard is not a text that should be read with the attitude
"they write this but I know that they really meant that".
A standard is precise.
In particular it defines the concepts used. For file it says:
File
An object that can be written to, or read from, or both.
A file has certain attributes, including access permissions and type.
File types include regular file, character special file, block special
file, FIFO special file, symbolic link, socket, and directory.
Other types of files may be supported by the implementation.
