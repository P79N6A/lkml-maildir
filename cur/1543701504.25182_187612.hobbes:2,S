Hmm. Perhaps prefetch updates CR2?
We know already that the CR2 is not directly linked to the page fault 
interrupt - if a page fault happens at the same time as a higher 
priority event (iirc hw interrupt), then CR2 is updated and the higher 
priority event is handled. That prevents Linux from using CR2 to store 
the cpu number - only netware can do that, because netware never causes 
paging faults.
Could you write a test module that reads cr2, executes a few prefetch 
instructions and then checks if cr2 changed? I won't have access to my 
P3 SMP system in the next few days.
