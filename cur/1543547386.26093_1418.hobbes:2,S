Oh you're telling us that you are not able to figure out what those
lines of C turn into in assembly so you can set a break point
yourself?

Yeah I bet NT also has a wonderful graphical click click wush wush
environment for it that allows you to spend all your time `improving'
your rsi instead of getting real work done. Have you ever looked at NT
device driver code? I have, it's not pretty at all so I can understand
why you need all these tools.
