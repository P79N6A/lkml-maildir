It could be argued that if `iptables` retains its
parameters after its only interface has been shut
down it's a bug.
The fact that no routes remain after a network
interface has been shut down is both logical
and in conformance with de facto Unix standards.
This is partially as a result of route's manipulating
flags (the UP flag would be wrong if the interface
was down).
I can't imagine that you have so many routes
that it takes a significant amount of time to
reset them using a script. If so, you probably
have a configuration error where you are
not properly using netmasks. Certainly, you
shouldn't have to establish a host-route for
every host on your network. You only need a
network route (out the interface) and a
default route that goes to some router to get
out of your LAN. Even if you __are__ a router,
the network setup remains about the same,
only the user-mode software changes, which
may dynamically alter the routing tables.
