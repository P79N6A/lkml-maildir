as instructed in REPORTING-BUGS, error - compiling linux 2.6.28
Sumary of the error:
after kernel and modules have been compiled fine, when running 'make modules_install' I got aways the same result:
/bin/sh: line 1:  7952 Aborted                 /sbin/depmod -ae -F System.map 2.6.28                     
make: *** [_modinst_post] Error 134
I also tried to use another configuration "from scratch" generated using "make allmodconfig" with the same result.
I am used to keep my machine with the newest kernel version and never had had this kind of problem...
My machine is currently running kernel 2.6.27.10 - Mandriva 2009.0 (gcc-4.3.2; glibc-2.8-1; module-init-tools-3.3-pre11.40) on a Intel Core 2 Duo CPU  E6550  @ 2.33GHz
the '.config' file is attached to this email
thank you in advance
