OK. What you say here is with this option compiled root can destroy 
the IDE drive(s), BUT has a "limited access" for non-root. Now, the 
REAL question here is: can a non-root user destroy IDE disk(s)? If 
no, then of what use is your patch? If the answer is a definite yes, 
then obviously there is a *serious* bug in the IDE/SCSI drivers.
I hope this may help the rather hot situation. :-)

BTW, you seem to lose your temper all to easily. Count slowly to 
(some number) while taking a deep breath between each count. :-)
