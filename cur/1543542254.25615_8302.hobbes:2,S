I'm beginning to see your point...
Maybe we should then have a "blk_queue_highmem_capable(q,flag)" 
function whereby drivers can tell elevator_make_request that they
are highmem aware, and so the create_bounce will be skipped ??

md_make_request needs it (I thought) because it accesses the data in the
buffers ... sometimes.
Particularly raid5 copies data between the buffer and the stripe
cache.   Obviously this can be done with kmap (now that I have read-up
and understand kmap) instead of with create_bounce.
So, in summary:
  I was advocating the "keep it simple for now" position advocated by
  the comment, and applying the one solution to all drivers.
  You seem to be advocating a "keep it flexable" position, saying that
  any driver that registers it's own make_request_fn must be highmem
  aware now.
It is hard to argue against your position now that I understand it.  I
will roll out an alternate patch shortly.
