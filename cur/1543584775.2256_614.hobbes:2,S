I couldn't trace that down to be 100% sure and it's better to conform to
design than implementation, so I'll ask:
Do the probe and remove functions of a pci_driver have to be able to
work in interrupt context?  (i.e. GFP_ATOMIC and stuff)
I expect so, since CardBus handling doesn't start a thread and would
call these functions from the context it got the insertion message
(interrupt context).
