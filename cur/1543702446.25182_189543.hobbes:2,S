Why does top still read /proc/*/statm anyway? It's not as if top actually
ever used that information (the top I looked at at the time, that is). I
submitted a patch a few months ago to remove statm because it is a)
broken and b) redundant. The message containing detailed reasoning
should be in the linux-mm archives.
