I ran into the same thing.  I only use ramfs as my initial boot
disk; upon boot I pivot root to tmpfs.  Thus in my application,
one workaround was to make the new root directory before creating
the ramdisk image.  Since that was the only write I ever did to
the initial ramdisk, avoiding the write let me boot again.
I have no idea why ramfs went ro.  It is annoying.  I haven't
tracked it down, though, since I was able to work around it.
(I may have to track it down yet, though, since I was thinking
of using ramfs to hold files that I intend to use with sendfile,
since tmpfs and sendfile don't [yet] mix.)
