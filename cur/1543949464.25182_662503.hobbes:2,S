well, i'm trying to assume the best, so please explain the following 
sequence of events to me:
1) as you said you knew about this bug - which bug causes more inlining
   overhead than hundreds of your uninlining patches combined. The bug
   was introduced ~2 years ago in -mm - before the feature hit mainline
   in v2.6.16.
2) the fix was really trivial and the intention of the feature was well 
   understood - but the feature stayed as a NOP in the upstream kernel 
   for 2 years.
still, while you clearly had interest in this general area of the kernel 
(for example you wrote hundreds of tiny uninlining patches that work 
towards a similar goal), but strangely at the same time you neither 
fixed, nor properly escallated this _far_ bigger bug that causes +2.3% 
of text bloat on x86 [more than 120K of kernel text]. In fact:
- you created bugzillas for far smaller bugs in the past, but you never
  created a bugzilla for this that i'm aware of.
- you never directly raised this issue with us: "look guys, this thing
  really is broken - please reply to me with a fix".
- you never said "this is a regression that should be fixed" to any of
  the regression lists.
in other words: for about two years you knew about a bug that should 
have been fixed the day after it got introduced.
i obviously cannot know what your intentions were with this conduct, so 
i'm eagerly awaiting your explanation for it. Thanks,
	Ingo
