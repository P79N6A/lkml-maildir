Nick, of these:
#sched-clean-init-idle.patch
#sched-clean-fork.patch
#sched-clean-fork-rename-wake_up_new_process-wake_up_new_task.patch
#sched-misc-cleanups-2.patch
#sched-unlikely-rt_task.patch
#sched-misc.patch
#sched-misc-fix-rt.patch
#sched-no-balance-clone.patch
#sched-remove-balance-clone.patch
#sched-fork-hotplug-cleanuppatch.patch
I have it isolated down to the sched-clean-init-idle.patch and
sched-clean-fork.patch. sched-clean-init-idle.patch fails to build without
the second of those two applied, so I didn't do any work to narrow it down
further.
