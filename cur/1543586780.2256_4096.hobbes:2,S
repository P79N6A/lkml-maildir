I think this is against UNIX/Linux philosophy... Why we wouldn't just
providing all the interface through sysctl stuff and abadon all the
/proc? Cause we want to provide human-readable interface, which could
be parsed really simply...
We should just mean 'cat' as 'userspace app' primarily i think. At least
currently we does. Also you have a big problem with forward compatibility
etc.
But anyway i would vote for the .config file somewhere in /boot directory.
If one have a kernel from some linux distribution, it is propably actually
obsolete, so it is proximity the bug is actually fixed anyway. And if he
will get the newest kernel, it should do something like cp .config /boot/config.
