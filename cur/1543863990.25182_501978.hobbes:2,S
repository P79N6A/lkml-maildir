Yes.  FWIW, we'll ship with our ETRAX FS developer boards, soon
enough (in a week or so, knock-on-wood).

I'd have to configure it in, but I guess I could, if you're not
happy with just vfat.  I just copied (tarred both to file, and
separately copied the tree through tar) 174 MeB from a USB stick
to separately a 512 MeB SDcard and a 2 GiB MMC card and they
both read out correctly from an (USB) SDcard reader connected to
my PC.  Is there a specific test you have in mind?
(I finally hashed out the "DMA" problems I've had.  I mistakenly
thought that a wait_for_completion_timeout return of 0 meant
that the completion didn't happen, grr!  Buggy or just confusing
API?  Kind-of the same problem as with your scanbyte timeout!
Looks like this kind of bug is elsewhere in the kernel too.)

What's the difference? :-)  (Don't forget, it's considered ok to
include experimental drivers on developer boards.)
