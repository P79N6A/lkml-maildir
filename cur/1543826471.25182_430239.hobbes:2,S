Ok, this is some bus or something, not "real" device, so no pci probing or
anything else could be done. There is only one in the system, if any, since
CONFIG_BCM947XX is set for some sort of embedded systems, but this would be
uttered by somebody more responsible.
Should I call pci_enable_device anyway, I am confused now :/? And then, should I
hold the reference all time until ifdown for this "some kind of parent"?
thanks,
