I believe problem is in software... basically UDP is broken. I don't
think you can call hw broken just because small RX ring. RX ring has
to have some fixed size, and if the OS is not fast enough, well, some
packets are going on the floor.
I believe SW should deal with RX ring being just one packet big, and
believe that UDP is to blame...
