Good point.
Thanks for posting the 2.6.9 output as well.  It contains this:
    ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKD] enabled at IRQ 10
    ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:00:07.2[D] -> GSI 10 (level, low) -> IRQ 10
    ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:00:07.3[D] -> GSI 10 (level, low) -> IRQ 10
    PCI: Via IRQ fixup for 0000:00:07.2, from 9 to 10
    PCI: Via IRQ fixup for 0000:00:07.3, from 9 to 10
In 2.6.9, we did all the ACPI IRQ routing early, then did the
Via IRQ fixups.  In 2.6.11, ACPI IRQ routing is done only when
a driver claims a device, and the Via IRQ fixup is done a little
differently.  In fact, the Via fixup happens before we twiddle
the IOAPIC, where in 2.6.9, it happened after.
Can you try the attached patch to see whether it makes any
difference?
