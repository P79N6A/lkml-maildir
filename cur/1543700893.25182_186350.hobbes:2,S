Merry Christmas Everyone,
I just downloaded full source code of linux-2.6.0 to start doing some work 
and testing of  Adaptec/DPT I2O controller's. This is when I happen to 
notice Adapec/DPT I2O option have been omitted from Linux Kernel 2.6.0 
Configuration tool.
Typically this option is located in *Device Drivers -> SCSI device support 
-> SCSI low-level drivers*. Furthermore it is also not listed in *Device 
Drivers -> I2O device support* also. And the driver source (dpti2o) is 
residing in /drivers/scsi.
Please advice how should I than go about in hacking Linux 2.6.0 Kernel 
Configuration tool to include Adaptec/DPT I2O support ?
Also any reason for the Adaptec/DPT I2O option being omitted out from Linux 
Kernel configuration tool  ? Or is it just happen to be accidental ? Will 
this be option made available in the next release or pre-release of 2.6 
kernel than ?
Thanks in advance.
Best Regards,
Leon
