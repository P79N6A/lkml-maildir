There are people out that say that readonly mount was
initially designed to behave as physically read only.
fsck was a wanted side-effect...
And trust me, most people think so before dialing
with a journaled filesystem. This was discussed
to death on the reiserFS list.
Clearly the definition of "ro" is weak, does it mean media or
filesystem view ? It's even weak on lower levels: There are
also disks out there that write even if physical write-protection
is enabled (for example auto-remapping after an ECC-recovery read).
Anyway, it is "especially" critical on the root filesystem because the
authors of filesystems can't support two ro states on boot.
Reiserfs allowed  -oro,noreplay.
Please tell me how to specify "noreplay" for the initial "/" mount
:)
Yes, I think that the journal is an integral part of the filesystem.
But this has nothing to do with forcing a write on "ro" mounts, which
I interpret as design bug. (ro,noreplay is also a kind of design bug,
everything except a virtual replay under physical ro conditions looks
like a design bug to me because it breaks user expectations either
by writing on "ro" or by giving an invalid view by "noreplay")
