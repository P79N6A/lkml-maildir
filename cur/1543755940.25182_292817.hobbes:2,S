First set of comments.  Mostly ignores the actual filesystem sematics
bits, that'll come next.

Do you really need to vmap it, and eat up vmallocspace and TLB entries?
Maybe some simple arithmetics on a page array could replace it?

don't think you need this one.

Can inode->u.generic_ip ever be non-NULL?  What about using
->alloc_inode and ->destroy_inode to have the rchan_buf allocated
as part of the inode?

I think you should split ->fileop_notify into individual operations for
each of the different events.

What do you need this one for?

should already be there through <linux/sched.h>

please use <linux/bitops.h>

what do you need this one for?

always use <linux/hardirq.h> instead

Using remap_pfn_range on normal kernel memory and the PageReserved flags, etc..
is not nice.  You'd better implement a ->nopage handler that just does a simple
array lookup and install the page.  And if you really care about the little
time this spends in the pagefault path you can implement ->populate and
support MAP_POPULATE mmaps :)

this doesn't fir the normal linux style.  Whic you use two lines below:

but here again not.

> +		buf->page_count = 0;

also this would be cleaner if placed at another goto label at the end

so this style is used in various places.  Please try to make it fit normal
style everywhere.
Also you're using foo == NULL a lot while we mostly use !foo.  This isn't
important in anyway, but would make reading a little easier.

I don't think these macros help following the code.

you need to place the relay_get_buf inside the locked region, so that
the return value from smp_processor_id() is stable.
