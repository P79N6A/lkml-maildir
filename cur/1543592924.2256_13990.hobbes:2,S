  If you say Y here, you will be able to classify outgoing packets 
  according to the tc_index field of the skb. You will want this 
  feature if you want to implement Differentiates Services useing
  sch_dsmark. If unsure, say Y.
  This code is also available as a module called cls_tcindex.o ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say MM
  here and read Documentation/modules.txt

  If you say Y here, you will be able to police incoming bandwidth
  and drop packets when this bandwidth exceeds your desired rate.
  If unsure, say Y.
