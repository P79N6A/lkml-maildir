Does this fix the problem where you unplug the cat 5 cable from an SiS900 and 
then plug it back in (toggling the MII tranciever link detect status and all 
that), and the device goes positively mental until you reboot the system?  
(Packets randomly dropped or delayed for up to 15 seconds, and arriving out 
of sequence with horrible impacts on performance?)
I tried pursuing this when I first noticed it circa 2.4.4, but as you say, the 
driver is unmaintained and I haven't got specs (or any clue about) the 
chipset...
