Yes, or dodgy connectors or other problems. The CRC itself is computed by
the hardware each end so a BadCRC error really means the two ends
disagree about the data. 
That is *usually* a cable/electrical noise problem. It can be power and
it can occasionally show up if the software misprograms the timing so the
two ends are a bit out of sync.
