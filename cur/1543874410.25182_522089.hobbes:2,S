  We've been discussing this sometimes back in August ;)
(
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/8/237
) and we've decided to leave the code in.
The only reason why I think it should stay in is the existence of quota
softlimits. There it's nice to warn the user and there's no other way to
propagate this information into userspace (as the write succeeds).
  One solution would be to leave the warning to some userspace process
(like warnquota) run from cron but still I'm not sure we should change the
behavior.
