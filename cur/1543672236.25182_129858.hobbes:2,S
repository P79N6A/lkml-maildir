Number one is the desired direction for net drivers.

this is already done in net drivers

this is questionable.  The netif_xxx messages are _already_ designed to 
be used in order of increasing verbosity.  If the user selects the more 
verbose class of messages, then rate-limiting may not be appropriate.

No need, in net drivers.  All of them already print out network 
interface, which is all you need to know.

Yes, standardization of net driver messages is desired.
