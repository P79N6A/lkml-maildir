We don't need that.
We just need one boolean per thread ... is it holding a kernel
lock or not?
If it is, make sure its scheduling latency isn't too high.
If it isn't holding any lock, we can do with it what we want,
including completely starving the task for several seconds
(or even minutes) if scheduling latency or VM pressure warrants
it.
regards,
Rik
