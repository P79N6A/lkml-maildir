I have the same problems with ATI Radeon 128. It occurs with when X (4.4) dies after using DRI. I tried with kernels 2.6.4 to 2.6.7 and the behaviour is identical.
It looks like it forgets to disable the interrupts in the video card. Commenting the DRI module out from XF86Config keeps it from happening. I don't have much expeirience with this stuff, so I can't tell whether the problem is in the X system or in the kernel driver.
