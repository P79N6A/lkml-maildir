On second thought, this code does have problems with highmem.  The page in
question was never kmapped, so no kernel address was assigned if the page
was a high memory page.  Besides that, there are other other changes to
page address that imply it can't be used with a high memory page.  So the
above code isn't generic.

Because of what I just said.
