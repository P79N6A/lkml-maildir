Subject: bttv does not compile in 2.2pre7ac4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I am not able to compile the bt848 driver into the kernel after moving
from pre7 to pre7ac4. Compiling the driver as a module works fine
without warnings.
