It guarantees that no other mmio will sneak past it from another thread
but doesn't guarantee the previous I/O has hit the hardware. It's a much
weaker (and thus far faster) guarantee which is usually sufficient as it
can be combined with spin_unlock to enforce I/O ordering matching the
lock ordering.
