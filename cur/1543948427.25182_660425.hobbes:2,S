Does this still happen to you with current mainline? If so, what is your 
.config? It works for me(TM):
read(0, "/bin/echo \"aaa\"\n", 1024)    = 16
write(2, "at> ", 4)                     = 4
read(0, "", 1024)                       = 0
write(2, "<EOT>\n", 6)                  = 6
write(4, "#!/bin/sh\n# atrun uid=1000 gid=1"..., 4076) = 4076
close(4)                                = 0
munmap(0x7f068f383000, 4096)            = 0
fchmod(5, 0700)                         = 0
close(5)                                = 0
stat("/etc/localtime", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=2246, ...}) = 0
write(2, "job 1 at 2008-02-27 14:42\n", 26) = 26
open("/var/run/atd.pid", O_RDONLY)      = 3
fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=5, ...}) = 0
fcntl(3, F_GETFL)                       = 0x8000 (flags 
O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE)
fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=5, ...}) = 0
mmap(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 
0x7f068f383000
lseek(3, 0, SEEK_CUR)                   = 0
read(3, "5679\n", 4096)                 = 5
setreuid(1000, 25)                      = 0
setregid(100, 25)                       = 0
kill(5679, SIGHUP)                      = 0
(this is 2.6.25-rc3).
