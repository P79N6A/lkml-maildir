I think I may have missed a fix for ext3 ordered and journalled too
(I've just sent a patch to Andrew privately).
Sorry. Can you try with ext2? Alternatively, try with ext3 or reiserfs
and change the line in mm/filemap.c:generic_file_buffered_write from
		status = a_ops->commit_write(file, page, offset, offset+copied);
to
		status = a_ops->commit_write(file, page, offset, offset+bytes);
and see if that solves your problem (that will result in rubbish being
temporarily visible, but there is a similar problem upstream anyway, so it
shouldn't cause other failures in your test).
Thanks,
Nick
