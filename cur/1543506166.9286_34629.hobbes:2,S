    I think you may misunderstand;  the klog snippet I posted, which
    does show that the kernel already knows about, is from one of my
    development workstations, and not from the offending machine.
    Even leaving aside my opinion that major and minor numbers are the
    most odious sort of black magic, the kernel as it stands today knows
    about the de facto standard for device names, and already has code
    that can decode and encode the black magic.   The code bloat needed
    to tuck skeleton tables for majors that aren't compiled in becomes
    nothing more than a simple major/minor->name mapping, which is
    probably a whopping 4k.
    I'd produce a patch, but I've already got a large pile of patches
    waiting for Linux to notice them.
