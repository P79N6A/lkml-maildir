I'm having problems with a custom solution I'm building with
applications that are seg faulting when trying to make a getgid system
call.  I've narrowed this down to a possible kernel issue; however, I
don't know how to resolve it.  Am I missing a kernel option or
something?
Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.
Oh, BTW, kernel version is 2.2.12
Regards,
Kevin
