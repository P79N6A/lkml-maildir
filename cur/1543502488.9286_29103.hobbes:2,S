I got _exactly_ the same thing when I used pcmcia-cs 3.0.13 with my
2.2.10-ac9 kernel. With the original 2.2.10 it is ok though. BTW, I'm
using the Debian 2.1 (slink) distribution. With SuSE 6.0 and 2.2.10
kernel (which I used 'till last week) pcmcia-cs 3.0.13 worked fine, but
then I had no 2.2.10-ac9 running.
Not much help for you, just the fact that you are not alone. There _is_
something rotten!
Greetings,
Stefan.
