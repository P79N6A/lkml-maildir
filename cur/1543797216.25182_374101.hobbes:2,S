Oh, that's what I do too, that is, I have a mecanism now to walk the
firmware device-tree and get the MMIO, my problem was with matching that
MMIO address with the PIO one that 8250 gets later on. It seems that you
solved that problem so it looks like I really need to look more closely
at what you are doing :)
