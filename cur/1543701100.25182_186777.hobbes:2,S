How do you set this (device mapping) up using the 2.6 kernel. I like the
ease of using ataraid in 2.4.x. Why not have both alternatives as options
(both ataraid and devicemapper)? Also have anyone of you looked at the patch
from Walt H that he sent in yesterday? I have to use this after replacing my
old hard drives (Maxtor 30GB) with WDC 80GB. The patch is attached.

It is? I think it's kind of simple (probably, if you know what's going on
;)). Which interface are you looking it?
I'm just looking at the ataraid code. Is my assumption correct, that it
simply interleaves sectors between two harddisks? Even sector number -> hd1,
odd number -> hd2?
Using the simple dmsetup tool one could try something like:
echo 0 $(expr $(blockdev --getsize /dev/<HD1>) \* 2) stripe 2 1 /dev/<HD1> 0
/dev/<HD2> 0 | dmsetup create ataraid
Where <HD1> and <HD2> should of course be replaced by the raw disks.
If everything is correct a device /dev/mapper/ataraid should be created.
Using libdevmapper something like:
dm_task_create(DM_DEVICE_CREATE)
dm_task_task_set_name (required)
dm_task_set_uuid (optional)
dm_task_add_target (only once in this case, contains the stripe target)
dm_task_set_ro (if readonly) dm_task_set_major / _minor (if you don't want a
dynamically allocated) dm_task_run
