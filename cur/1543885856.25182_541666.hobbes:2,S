is it really enough to do the sync followed by the async piece?
it seems to me that there may be a need for three steps
1. prep (sync, what we do today)
which will all complete before
2. parallel (async)
which will all complete before
3. cleanup (sync)
for some busses you can do the device enumeration in the prep phase, but I 
would expect that for others you can't enumerate the devices until you 
actually go looking for them. so by allowing the cleanup phase you have a 
spot that can order everything as if the second phase was sequential.
I would expect that almost no drivers would use all three, but I could see 
some useing #1 and #2 while others use #2 and #3
in any case there needs to be a way to wait until the async portion 
finishes before going on to next steps (you don't want to try to probe 
drives for md partitions until the drives have finished spinning up for 
example)
