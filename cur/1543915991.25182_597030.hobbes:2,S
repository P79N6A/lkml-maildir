You've already said that you are currently saving all pages. How are you going 
to avoid saving free pages if you don't get the information from the kernel 
being saved? This will require more than just code reuse.

That only complicates things more. Now you need to get the information on 
where to save the image from the kernel being saved, then transfer it to 
userspace after switching to the kexec kernel. That's more kernel code, not 
less.

Sorry, but I'm yet to be convinced. I'm not unwilling, I'm just not there yet.
