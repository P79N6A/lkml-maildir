If you have to ask this question than it's no wonder you get erratic
behavior.  It means you haven't looked at the pthread interface at all.
Define a pthread_attr_t with the appropriate setting (with
pthread_attr_setschedparam etc) and create the thread (and use
pthread_attr_setinheritsched correctly).  Alternatively use
pthread_setschedparam on already running threads.
And use a recent enough nptl version.   Very early versions didn't have
any of the scheduler handling implemented.
