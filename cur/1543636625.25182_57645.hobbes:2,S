If you refer to the SIZEOF undefined symbol thing - that was a different
problem and indeed a kernel bug. But with full vsyscalls we run into
more relocation problems because the linker seems to have problems
with the secondary mapping used by vsyscalls with more complex code.
Of course it could be still a kernel bug, but I do not see where it 
should come from.
In short the mapping trick used by the current vsyscall code is very 
nasty. It requires quite some non obvious vmlinux.lds trickery that
seems to easily cause/trigger bugs in both binutils and kernel. I would
be better to find a more maintaineable solution for the secondary mappings.
