Couple of patches for the Crystal Semi (now Cirrus Logic) ethernet
chipset. A couple of the constants in the header file are wrong
(obvious by inspection from the data sheet, available at
http://www.cirrus.com/ftp/pubs/8900a.pdf
). The net result of this is
that although the driver detects transmit underrun and attempts to
disable pipelined transmit, it never actually manages to turn it off
completely.
Also, the code that handles transmit underrun doesn't treat the
condition as it should i.e. transmit complete but failed, so when it
happens you had to wait for the upper layers to time out before the
frame gets retransmitted.
Both of these are probably only issues on machines with slow and/or
broken buses, so I doubt anybody has actually been affected by either
problem.
Oh, and fixed a couple of spelling mistakes, and bumped the minor
version number by 1.
Patches against 2.2.10.
