Then the answer is obvious, produce the hooks in the US, then publish
them in book form, post them to Finland and get some poor students to
scan them and OCR them for months and re-build them there ;)
It does seem MAD that the US govt. will restrict you from exporting
crypto that is freely available outside the US. Obviously they think
that a terrorist or drug lord is too dumb to go to www.pgpi.com to get
the same program they aren't allowed to get from www.pgp.com!
