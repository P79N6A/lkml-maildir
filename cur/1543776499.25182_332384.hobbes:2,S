Subject: RFC: schedule obsolete OSS drivers for removal

There are several OSS drivers for hardware that also has ALSA drivers.
My current plan is:
- let all such OSS drivers depend on a OBSOLETE_OSS_DRIVER option
- wait three months
- remove the drivers
Are there any objections against such a plan?
