This tree has 38 deltas, all just merges.
The end result is a horribly messy revision tree, for a few one-liners.
I'm going to take the patch as a patch instead, and hope that you'll throw 
your BK tree away.
Please don't follow the release tree in your development trees, it makes 
it impossible to see how the revision history happened.
