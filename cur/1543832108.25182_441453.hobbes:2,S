OK, I tried starting with this one.
The problem is that in the CONFIG_SWAP=n case, linux/swap.h uses these 
functions.
These implicit declarations are bugs that should be fixed.
I tried adding an #include <linux/pagemap.h> to linux/swap.h, but this 
broke things faster than I could fix them.
Does anyone know our header mess good enough for being able to help me 
with this issue?
