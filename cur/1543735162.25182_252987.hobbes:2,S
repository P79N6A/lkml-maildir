The following patches in -mm are likely to help top(1).
kallsyms-data-size-reduction--lookup-speedup.patch
  kallsyms data size reduction / lookup speedup
inconsistent-kallsyms-fix.patch
  Inconsistent kallsyms fix
kallsyms-correct-type-char-in-proc-kallsyms.patch
  kallsyms: correct type char in /proc/kallsyms
kallsyms-fix-sparc-gibberish.patch
  kallsyms: fix sparc gibberish
As for all syscalls/etc. being slower by 50%-100%, I suggest toning
down HZ (we desperately need to go tickless) and seeing if it persists.
Also please check that time isn't twice as fast as it should be in 2.6.
