I'd avoid "bus"; the term has specific meanings, which aren't necessarily
relevant in these contexts.  Agreed about "adjacent" and "bank".
If it weren't for its verb usage, I'd suggest "set".  :)

For these operations, I think reads/writes should have that possibility.
The reason single-bit operations don't provide error paths is twofold.
First, they started as wrappers for can't-fail register accessors.
Second, it's extremely unrealisitic to expect much code to handle any
kind of faults in the middle of bitbanging loops ... or even just in
classic "set this bit and continue" configuration code.
Those reasons don't apply well to these multi-bit cases.

Agreed.  If there's any difficulty implementing them, that would
suggest there's a significant conceptual problem to address ...

Right.  Get the interface right -- it should allow all those
complexities! -- and maybe take shortcuts in the first versions
of the implementation, by only talking to one gpio_chip at a
time.  I'd expect any shortcuts would be resolved quickly, to
the extent they cause problems.

Such pin-muxing is a different issue though.  Don't expect GPIO
calls to resolve those problems.

That's why I pointed to <linux/bitmask.h> as one model:  it allows
an arbitrary set of bits (GPIOs) to be specified.
I'll NAK any "gpio_port_t" name based entirely on kernel coding
conventions though.  ;)

That sort of thing might be made to work.  Whatever this
multiple-GPIO-set abstraction is, I suspect you're right
about wanting the request function to be able to build
up some data structures behind it.  And that it would be
simpler to require all the GPIOs to be listed up front,
rather than support "add these to the set" requests.
