If we never asked for these messages, why did it send them?

Yep. That's what's happening. Now, how do I defuse it? I *think* I'm setting 
this up just as suggested on this list and various other sources, yet still 
it is a no-go. 
Btw. I got those error messages while trying to copy data from an 
NFS-mounted volume from an old, slow, busy server to my RAID. This tells me 
that probably the errors aren't caused by the SX6000 getting floodded by 
incoming data stream and not being able to keep up with it.
