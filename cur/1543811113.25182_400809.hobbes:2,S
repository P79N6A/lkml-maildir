Hi,
Trying to flush my patch queue.
The following 13 patches have all been posted to LKML previously, but seem to
have been lost.
Since I know they will eventually bit-rot if they just sit on my harddrive I have 
re-diff'ed them against 2.6.16-rc4-mm2 and are submitting them again.
They are all pretty trivial and there's no 2.6.16 material in here, so I was 
just hoping that they could make it into -mm and then eventually into 
mainline in time for 2.6.17 or later (that is unless someone screams at them).
