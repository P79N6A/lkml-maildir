Probably.  With the split LRU lists (and the noreclaim LRUs), we can
simplify the OOM test a lot:
If free + file_active + file_inactive <= zone->pages_high and swap
space is full, the system is doomed.  No need for guesswork.

What would you use those functions for?
Or am I simply misunderstanding your idea?
