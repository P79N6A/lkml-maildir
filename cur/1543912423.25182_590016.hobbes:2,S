you might want to use a weak function instead ?
void __weak arch_randomize_brk(void)
{
	/* nada by default */
}
and overload it only for x86 architectures by now.
BTW, how about minimize the arch specific code by slighly changing its
prototype  ?
unsigned long arch_randomize_brk(struct mm_struct *mm)
{
	unsigned long range_end = mm->brk + 0x02000000;
	
	return randomize_range(mm->brk, range_end, 0) ? : mm->brk;
}
