Subject: [PATCH 2.6.16-mm1 2/3] finish_stop: don't check stop_count < 0
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/3/24/190

Remove an obscure 'stop_count < 0' check in finish_stop().
The previous patch made this case impossible.
