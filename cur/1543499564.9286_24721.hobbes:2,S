Subject: mmap() of PCI space in device driver

I am porting a PCI device driver from 2.0.x to 2.2.x and am having
specific trouble porting the implementation of the mmap() function.
I have read IO-mapping.txt, reviewed the linux-kernel archive, and
skimmed recent comp.os.linux.development.system articles.  The
IO-mapping.txt file seems to imply that I may not be able to do
what I want in a portable way.
The PCI device I have decodes a single 16MB memory space.  I need
to be able to map this space into the user space so that users can
access it through pointers.  The old driver supports both Intel
and Alpha architectures; the new driver must support both as well.
The older 2.0.x driver I am porting makes use of the remap_page_range()
function.  Where can I find a description of this function?
(beyond what is in mm.h and memory.c)
The older driver will not compile due to an assignment to the
vm_inode field of the vm_area_struct structure.  This field no
longer exists in 2.2.x.  What is the relationship between the 
file->f_dentry->d_inode and the vm_area_struct structure?
Thanks,
Scott
