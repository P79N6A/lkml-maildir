There is no case law in Germany.
I'm talking about the text written in paragraph 69g (2) of the German
"Gesetz ueber Urheberrecht und verwandte Schutzrechte
(Urheberrechtsgesetz)".

German copyright law says that any clauses that forbid reverse 
engineering for gathering data needed for independendly developed 
programs to interoperate with this program are void. Full stop.
There's simply no legal possibility for you under current German 
copyright law to allow anyone to use your program without allowing him 
to reverse engineer your proprietary protocol.

German copyright law talks about licensees, not about money. It doesn't 
matter whether the licence was free or whether it costs a billion Euro.
If you don't believe me ask any lawyer who knows German copyright law.
