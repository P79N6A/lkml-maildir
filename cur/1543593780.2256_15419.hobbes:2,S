Hi there,
please CC me to replies on linux-usb-devel, since I'm not
subscribed there.
I try to use my Handspring Visor USB craddle with Linux. I've
seen, that this will work, but all the other people use a UHCI
driver for this, so this could be as well an OHCI issue.
loaded modules:
visor                  10256   0  (unused)
usbserial              18128   0  [visor]
usb-ohci               22352   0  (unused)
usbcore                58256   1  [visor usbserial usb-ohci]
Pressing the hotsync button, I get the message from the subject
line (with variing values for "address"). Even plugging into
another USB port doesn't help. Only the usb port adress changes.
lspci -vvvv (attached)
.config (attached)
kernel messages since boot (attached)
Would be nice, if we can solve/debug this ;-)
Regards
Ingo Oeser
