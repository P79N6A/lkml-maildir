  Well, this is a problem of mkudffs. As you write, it should erase few
blocks in the beginning of the filesystem so that it's not detected as some
other filesystem. If you actually mount it as the older filesystem, nasty
things can happen to the new one.
  If you got no answer so far, try reporting the problem here:

  Definitely unconnected to your UDF problems :) /proc is a bit special
filesystem and find(1) is sometimes confused by that fact. Using -noleaf
for it is always a good idea.

  And this depends on the configuration of your syslogd. Message is written
to console (probably tty10 or so on your system) and sent to syslog which
handles it further. So if it should be written somewhere else, syslog
should do it...

  If there was some problem, it would be written to /var/log/messages. It
seems you haven't found anything there... Umm, can you reproduce the
problem if you try to do the same?
