Yes, I know they hit the message, that's from a message in some forum
that i got interested in the issue. It probably comes from an allocation
from:
http://www.linux-m32r.org/lxr/http/source/arch/powerpc/kernel/pci_direct_iommu.c#L32
Either the ppc code is wrong (it doesn't enforce dma_mask) either the
driver still works without the check.
Maybe ppc should do the same thing as i386:
47         if (dev == NULL || (dev->coherent_dma_mask < 0xffffffff))
48                 gfp |= GFP_DMA;
thanks,
Benoit
