DEVICE partitions
ARRAY /dev/md0 UUID=xxyy:zzyy:aabb:ccdd

I could change mdassemble to allow accepting an uuid on the command line
and assemble a /dev/md0 with the specified uuid (at the moment it only
accepts a configuration file, which i tought was enough for
initrd/initramfs.

I don't like using partition type as a qualifier, there is people who do
not wish to partition their drives, there are systems not supporting
msdos like partitions, heck even m$ is migrating away from those.
In any case if that has to be done it should be done into mdadm, not
in a different scrip that is going to call mdadm (behaviour should be
consistent between mdadm invoked by initramfs and mdadm invoked on a
running system).
If the user wants to reutilize a device that was previously a member of
an md array he/she should use mdadm --zero-superblock to remove the
superblock.
I see no point in having a system that tries to compensate for users not
following correct procedures. sorry.
