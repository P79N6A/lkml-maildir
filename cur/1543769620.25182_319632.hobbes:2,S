There may be subtle performance differences, but I'd say the most
important here is to use the API that best suits the problem at hand.
fwrite/fread is sequential in nature, useful when you want to read/write
large contigous chunks of data, and when the notion of a "current position"
in the file is useful.
mmap is nice when you find it useful to access the file as a random-access
array of bytes. mmap style access seems to be the best fit for a 
framebuffer.
