Hi,
I can't say about FC2 in particular, but in looking
at 2.6.5 from kernel.org, it looks like this:
[*] Remove kernel features (for embedded systems)  --->
{enable above and press Enter, then see this:}
[*]   Load all symbols for debugging/kksymoops (NEW)
{enable above and save it}
Hope that helps, if not, please try (send) again.
