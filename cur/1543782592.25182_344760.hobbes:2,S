How would that help? It's still a decoder in the kernel, so why not use
one that's well tested instead of using whatever the archive thinks is
good?
Also remember the code has to be cross platform: an in-kernel decoder
will just work on any platform, a self-extracting binary will probably
only work on one platform.
Besides, initramfs was made to set up userland. A self-extracting
binary creates a chicken-and-egg problem: when run it will create a
userland, but in order to be run it needs a userland.
