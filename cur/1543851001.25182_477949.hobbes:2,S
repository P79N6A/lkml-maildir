So you mean the memory _consumption_ limit is already controlling
the page cache? That's what we need the ability for a container
not to fill up the page cache :)
I don't remember correctly, but do you account for dirty page cache usage in
the latest patches of BC?

The idea of pre-allocation was discussed as a possibility in the case
that somebody needed hard guarantees, but most of us don't need it.
I was in the RFC for the sake of completeness.
Coming back to your question
Why do you need to select a NUMA node? For performance?
