Subject: [PATCH] sched domain sysctl: free kstrdup allocations
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/15/496

The procnames for the cpu and domain were allocated via kstrdup and so
should also be freed.   The names for the files are static, but we
can differentiate them by the presence of the proc_handler.  If a
kstrdup (of < 32 characters) fails the sysctl code will not see the
procname or remaining table entries, but any child tables and names
will be reclaimed upon free.

Hi Ingo.
It occurred to me this morning that the procname field was dynamically
allocated and needed to be freed.  I started to put in break statements
when allocation failed but it was approaching 50% error handling code.
I came up with this alternative of looping while entry->mode is set and
checking proc_handler instead of ->table.  Alternatively, the string
version of the domain name and cpu number could be stored the structs.
I verified by compiling CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB and checking the allocation
counts after taking a cpuset exclusive and back.
