Well, it wouldn't be too hard to have the container code manage
multiple container hierarchies in parallel if people wanted the
ability to do this. You'd just replace the
    struct container *container;
field in task_struct with
    struct container *containers[MAX_CONTAINER_HIERARCHIES]
and have each instance of the container filesystem manage a different
hierarchy. Perhaps to configure this from userspace you could do
something like
mount -t container xxx -octype=cpuset /dev/cpuset
mount -t container yyy -octype=resgroup,ctype=cpuacct /mnt/rescontainer
i.e. mount one container hierarchy on /dev/cpuset with just the cpuset
container type, and mount an independent hierarchy on
/mnt/rescontainer with the resgroup and cpuacct container types
attached to it. You'd probably want to enforce a rule that each
container type could only be attached to a single hierarchy at a time.
Anyone have any thoughts on the usefulness/insanity of such an idea?
The most useful part of it may be the ability to e.g. create a
container hierarchy that explicitly doesn't cause e.g. multiple
cpusets to be created, if you want to avoid the overhead that kicks in
when there are multiple cpusets in use. That could be approximated
without the overhead of multiple container hierarchy support by having
a control file(s) in the top container dir that lets you configure
which container subsystems are actually in use. So e.g. if you turned
cpusets off before creating any subcontainers, all containers would
actually share the same cpuset instance, and we could avoid any of the
overheads associated with having multiple cpusets.
This would be somewhere in between the existing state of a single
hierarchy with multiple fixed container types, and the full-blown
multiple hierarchies with configurably-attachable container types that
I outlined above.

Fair enough - so have the various container types do "select
CONTAINERS" rather than "depends on CONTAINERS"?

I already had something like that at the top - I've now made it
clearer that these copyright statements came from the cpuset.c code
from which this code was abstracted.
