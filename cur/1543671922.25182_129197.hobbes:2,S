So I did a proof-of-concept version of this, without modifying any
source code.  I rm-ed arch/<many>, drivers/<many>, and fs/<many>
and then wrote a shell script that looks for missing dirs, Kconfigs,
and Makefile.lib files and puts empty ones back in their places.
The shell script only works for what I rm-ed, but it could be made
smarter if anyone wants to pursue this.  (attached)
After doing that I was able to build and boot that kernel, so it
(concept) did work.
For a kernel source tree that hadn't been built/compiled in, the size
was reduced from roughly 200 MB down to roughly 133 MB.

| | The message mirrored at:
| | 
| | http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=105173077417526&w=2
| | 
| | Shows my pre-thought on this subject.  I thought a bit more,
| | and began to come up with a simple sketch to lead the
| | way in case anyone becomes interested.
| | 
| | First off, the kernel tarballs would be built by a script
| | that splits the source tree apart appropriately and tar's it
| | up.  How this is done is explained.
| | 
| | Second off, there's always a script to download that runs
| | wget and gets the source tree from which it was downloaded.
| | The whole thing.  As in, every tarball is downloaded and
| | untar'd for the user, assembling the full kernel source
| | tree (as it would be if you untar'd it now).
| | 
| | Now, I explained LOD's in that message above in small
| | detail.  But, for clarity, LOD's are files which explain
| | which pieces of source in the kernel tree belong to the
| | LOD; what gets added to the config; where their makefiles
| | are; what config options depend on other linux options;
| | and what groups these LOD's are in.
| | 
| | A command such as `make disttree` should read the LOD's,
| | split apart each linux option, tar 'em together, and
| | then compress the tar's.  Then Linus could just scp the
| | new directory of tar's and a script up.
| | 
| | As for download, the script that goes up can be
| | downloaded (duh), and then run (... why do I bother?).
| | Now this script would run in "dumb mode" (unless the
| | user tells it not to maybe?) and rip down the whole
| | tree, untar it, and rebuild the original source tree.
| | I think.  I'm not sure, I really haven't tried yet.
| | I'll tell you how it works after it's implimented, if
| | ever that happens.  This would likely require wget.
| | 
| | Of course there's always the ftp method.  Go download
| | the pieces you want, untar 'em, copy 'em to the same
| | directory, and the build system adjusts.  but newbies
| | and developers, for completely opposite reasons, will
| | want to use the script in dumb mode.
| | 
| | For experienced users, this will make configuration
| | somewhat easier, as the user can avoid being prompted
| | for irrelavent drivers.  This is just a concept idea,
| | not a fully thought-out idea.  What do you think?
