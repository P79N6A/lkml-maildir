Ok, for the last few test kernels, there is a horribly
annoying usb keyboard bug.  after a while in X, or
just when you start putting some input, all the
keyboard lights on on my msnatpro keyboard.  after
that, the keycodes  are screwed up(like the left alt
button)
sometimes one key would stick, like
kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
now with test 5, the keyboard seems to stop responding
completely
the only fix is to unplug/replug keyboard
help?
