Thanks, Greg. There's a little tidbit in usbmon about which I wish you to
make a pronouncement explicitly:
+	/* XXX Is this how I pin struct bus? Ask linux-usb-devel */
+	kobject_get(&ubus->class_dev.kobj);
+	mbus->u_bus = ubus;
+	ubus->mon_bus = mbus;
Is this a good way to guarantee that mbus->u_bus won't be dangling?
This is used not just when someone pulls a PCMCIA card, but also
in case of plain rmmod ohci-hcd.
