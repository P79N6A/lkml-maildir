Yep; this chunk used to break out only on !retval, so at worst it's a
data corrupter for multi-segment iovecs.  If one do_generic_file_read()
returned a short read we'd update retval but then move on to the next
segment of the iovec; if the next one succeeded we'd be reading into the
next segment but ppos wouldn't be correctly advanced.
The fix looks correct --- we still only return an error if no data at
all has been returned, but we break out of the IO completely at the
first short read.
