Then the README should be listed (linked) on one of the 2 web pages
above.  I can't find it without downloading "CML2 prototype
and documentation," right?  I think that it should be
more visible that Python version x.yy(?) is needed, without
having to download the tarball.  Or did I miss the README
somewhere?
Thanks,
