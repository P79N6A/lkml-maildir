If so, then that's a separate problem: the later code
	count = ((LATCH-1) - count) * TICK_SIZE;
	delay_at_last_interrupt = (count + LATCH/2) / LATCH;
will cause delay_at_last_interrupt to be negative, so you'll see
backwards jumps in time and occasional wraparound of usecs as I did.
Perhaps a 
	if (count == LATCH) 
	   count--;
after the reset code?
