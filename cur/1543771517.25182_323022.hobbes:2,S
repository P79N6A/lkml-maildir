Hi,
Can I install an athlon(amd32) rpm on an amd64(x86_64)
machine.
When I tried installing, I am getting an ELF file
incompatibility. The .obj file in the athlon rpm is
ELF-32bit but the system is x86_64.
I guess it should still work? 
Maybe my rpm is bad.
If not, can I install an athlon(amd32) rpm on an i386
machine?
My apologies if this is not the right mailing list for
this type of question. 
with regards,
  Anil
