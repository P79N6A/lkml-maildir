It will trigger on just the commit that introduces the user-visible 
breakage, so yes, it's usually the last in a series (or the first one, for 
that matter).
And it's not perfect. A problem that fades in and out is not something you
can do binary searching on. For example, sometimes a bug gets introduced
and ends up being dependent on things like cache alignment or some
variable layout etc, so you only _see_ the problem occasionally, and it 
ends up happening due to totally unrelated changes - then the bisection 
algorithm ends up being totally useles..
