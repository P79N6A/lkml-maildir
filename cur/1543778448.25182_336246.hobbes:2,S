USB's hardware architecture was optimized for cost and ease of use,
it was not optimized for performance or power savings.
We need software disable because the USB hardware will keep
the memory bus busy constantly even if all the
actual USB devices are idle.  The power cost is that the CPU
is prevented from deep sleep so that it can snoop USB's
(idle) memory activity.
