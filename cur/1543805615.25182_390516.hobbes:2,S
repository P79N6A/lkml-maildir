As this is not a full implementation, just a partly fleshed-out RFC, the
kfree() hooks aren't there yet.  Essentially, the plan would be to add a
mempool_t pointer to struct slab, and if that pointer is non-NULL when
we're freeing an unused slab, return it to the mempool it came from.
As you mention, there is no guarantee as to how long the critical page will
be in use for.  One idea to tackle that problem would be to use the new
mempool_t pointer in struct slab to provide exclusivity of critical slab
pages, ie: if a non-critical slab request comes in and the only free page
in the slab is a 'critical' page (it came from a mempool) then attempt to
grow the slab or fail the non-critical request.  Both of these concepts
were (more or less) implemented in my other attempt at solving the critical
pool problem, so moving them to fit into this approach should not be difficult.
Thanks!
