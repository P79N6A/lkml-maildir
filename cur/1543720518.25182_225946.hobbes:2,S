Subject: Re: [PATCH] Staircase Scheduler v6.3 for 2.6.7-rc2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/6/8/8

the results I published also included 2.4.23 runs
which do not have the stair step scheduler.
Also, I have run this on 2.6-1->2.6.7-rc<x>, all the
2.6.x series are slower than the 2.4 series.
Thank you for your time.
