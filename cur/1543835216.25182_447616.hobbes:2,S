Fixed. Introduced a dummy variable "item_nil" that item_cur points to in
the empty case. So no need for special cases all over.

My experiments so far tells me that a resize generates KEY_RESIZE so it
is a simple matter of handling KEY_RESIZE correct in the different
dialog_* functions - and no signal handler needed. Thats looks like the
approach taken in the dialog package too.

Thanks - will implment this for all the dialog_* functions.
