The patch is more readable, but it looks like it's also a bit slower.  If
state is TASK_STOPPED but exit_code is 0, we end up (uselessly) testing state
a second time, since it is volatile.  I haven't tried, but I believe this
would be fixed by swapping the two tests (test for TASK_ZOMBIE first).
Also, when I tried this, it looks like the text size for exit.o is the same
before and after, so I'm not sure why the size of vmlinux varies.
