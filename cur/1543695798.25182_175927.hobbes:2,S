I have Duron 850 on VIA 82c686b motherboard (ATA 100). Stable kernels
works ok, but in 2.6 series I've got troubles with disk operations.
Whenever I'm copying files it takes 100% of my CPU and load of a system
grows up to 5-10 (especially if it's a big file). Even reading of floppy
disk (or cdrom) gives similar effects.
I don't know which information will be usefull - dmesg, hdparm, lspci and
config of my kernel are here:
