I like the patch that Andrew Morton sent in reply to this better.
Note that in the event that the above code does the following sequence
it will cause a stale pointer to be used:
	con_flush_chars    con_close
	vt = <>
	                   tty->driver_data = NULL
	acquire_console_sem()
	set_cursor()
	release_console_sem()
Now it _might_ be ok to act on a stale vt pointer, but it sure
feels like thin ice. I'm not sure that there is any danger of
the vt data being modified in a way that would break this, but
since the tty no longer has a reference it is bad practice.
What the earlier patch did is created some very subtle semantics
for a small window of a race. It fixed the blaring bug (the OOPS)
but left a possible one that would be harder to find....
