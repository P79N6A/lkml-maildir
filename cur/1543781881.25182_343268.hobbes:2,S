Condition variables offer no control over which thread is waken up. 
We're wandering into the design of the SleepyCat BerkeleyDB library 
here, and we don't exert any control over that either. BerkeleyDB 
doesn't appear to use pthread condition variables; it seems to construct 
its own synchronization mechanisms on top of mutexes (and yield calls). 
In this specific example, we use whatever BerkeleyDB provides and we're 
certainly not about to write our own transactional embedded database 
engine just for this.
