Potentially, any address can be a candidate. If you assume a sequential
access pattern for data, addresses toward the back of the cache-line
(but not the last few bytes) are less likely to hit the errata
because hopefully the page that the cacheline is in is 
already "faulted in". But that is no guarantee.
