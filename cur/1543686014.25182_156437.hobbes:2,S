Well, on the upside, 2.95.4 (Debian Woody) seems to work fine, so you don't 
have to drown yourself in the pit of slow treacle. However, after printing
"kgdb <20030806.1101.35> : port =3f8, IRQ=4, divisor =1", it spews out 
garbage to the serial console (looks like 8-bit data or something).
I didn't enable it on the cmd line, just compiled it in ... does that 
trigger it for you?

Degredation on kernbench is still there:
Kernbench: (make -j N vmlinux, where N = 16 x num_cpus)
                              Elapsed      System        User         CPU
              2.6.0-test3       45.97      115.83      571.93     1494.50
          2.6.0-test3-mm1       46.43      122.78      571.87     1496.00
Quite a bit of extra sys time. I thought the suspected part of the sched
changes got backed out, but maybe I'm just not following it ...

4/4 split is still being wierd for me (same pattern as before). I think
it's just the rc script crapping out which causes the hostname not to
get set, or the rootfs to get remounted r/w.
