Greg, as you correctly pointed out this patch if broken. It could never reach 
the if branch and always uses the else branch. Please drop this one and 
review the patch I sent on March 21th to pcihp-discuss for inclusion. It 
removes much more duplication and handles this case correctly. Sorry, it 
looks like I forgot to CC you. I'll bounce this mail to you.
