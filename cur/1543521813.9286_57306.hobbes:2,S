Hi Folks,
This year we're going to have the day February 30th and neither Linux, AIX,
Windows NT, 98, 95 know this problem. Feb30th happens each 400 years (Last
time we had that was year 1600). There's a webpage (in portuguese) from IDG
http://www.uol.com.br/idgnow/corp/corp2000-01-10e.shl
 (you can translate it
