We hit this on PPC too.

No, because we have device drivers that are initialized with a
device_initcall and which reasonably expect the PCI subsystem to be
set up before they are called.
I can see two solutions: either rename "unused_initcall" to "sys_init"
or something similar and use it for sys_bus_init, or else make an
alias for fs_initcall called "bus_init" or something and use that for
pcibios_init.
Paul.
