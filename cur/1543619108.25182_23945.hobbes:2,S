I'd say: cc Linus specifically if you think it's something he'd find 
personally interesting.  Leave out the cc if it's a minor bugfix or 
maintainance.
Oh, as somebody suggested in this thread, there is a difference in priority 
between bugfixes and other kinds of patches.  Should buxfixes go to 
patches-xxx@kernel.org with [BUGFIX] in the subject, or would 
bugs-xxx@kernel.org be a better idea?

Out-of-band patches are not going to stop.  The difference is, they will be 
duly noticed after the fact because they should be relatively few in 
comparison to in-band patches.
Another kind of out-of-band patch is where Linus takes the basic idea from 
somebody's patch and completely rewrites it, or does some hacking on his own, 
which he's been known to do.  Somehow I wouldn't expect he'd bother emailing 
the results to himself.
