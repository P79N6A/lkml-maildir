if rev F before cpu aka Rev E is installed, and 8G RAM installed, it will be

and you will have problem...
So good way is get the ram top, and hole size...and reset the whole
set ot var mtrr.
you could refer the code in LinuxBIOS about setting that...
http://www.openbios.org/viewvc/trunk/LinuxBIOSv2/src/cpu/x86/mtrr/mtrr.c?revision=2616&view=markup
esp the part about CONFIG_VAR_MTRR_HOLE...
but Andi and Eric said resetting mtrr is not good... when someone from
intel try to trim the MTRR for intel CPU.
