Hi,
In linux/arch/i386/kernel/ptrace.c next code is being used in the xxxreg
functions:
	if (regno > GS*4)
		regno -= 2*4;
Why this discontinuity? It doesn't prevent ORIG_EAX and EIP from being
written and makes the defines CS, EIF, ... from linux/include/asm/ptrace.h
useless. BTW: regno should really call reg_offset since it's no register
number but an offset.
Please CC me,
Frank.
