What inotify needs is some kind of SUBDIR flag on a watch so that one does not
run out of fds, then the TB issue becomes a bit lighter I think.

It may, and in some cases, not. For example, I only had a single filesystem,
and would like atime notificatios for it, then how would I do that? What comes
to mind is to use a fuse fs that mirrors, but also notifies, ergo:
	mount -t fuse.lomount / /mnt
Well, wonderful, now I still need to pivot_root to /mnt, so that all accesses
actually end up in fuse-land. And this gets ugly on shutdown, when things have
to be unmounted.
