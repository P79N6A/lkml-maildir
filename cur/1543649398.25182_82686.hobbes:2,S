Actually shared page tables work on any shared memory area, no matter how
it was created.  When a page fault occurs and there's no pte page already
allocated (the common case for any newly mapped region) it checks the vma
to see if it's shared.  If it's shared, it gets the address_space for that
vma, then walks through all the shared vmas looking for one that's mapped
at the same address and offset and already has a pte page that can be
shared.
So if your history file is mapped at the same address for all your
processes then it will use shared page tables.  While it might be a nice
add-on to allow sharing if they're mapped on the same pte page boundary,
that doesn't seem likely enough to justify the extra work.
