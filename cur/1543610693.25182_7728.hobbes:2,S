it's pitiful to pretend that this miniscule risk (50ms per catastrophic
power failure) is all that stands between you and absolute stability
of storage.

your religious pursuits are your own business.  
the rest of the world will go on calculating probabilities of failure,
rather than emoting.  using raid, redundant sites, upses, etc, 
rather than obsessing on how terrible IDE disks are.
in summary: write caching on disks is *not* an impediment to robust systems.
I've omitted lkml from this reply since it has nothing to do with the kernel.
