Alright, I got the same oops w/ 2.6.9 and vs1.9.3-rc3:
Assertion failure in log_do_checkpoint() at fs/jbd/checkpoint.c:361: "drop_count != 0 || cleanup_ret != 0"
I noticed someone else had this problem too:
http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=123137
I also followed up on that w/ my oops from 2.6.8.1.
I also upgraded to 0.30.195, though I don't think that (or vserver in
general, really) is related to this oops.
If there's anything else I can do to help get this resolved, please let
me know..  This is the only problem I'm having with this server now,
other than this it's behaving pretty nicely. :)
