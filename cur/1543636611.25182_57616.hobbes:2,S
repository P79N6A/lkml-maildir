Subject: [PATCH 6/6] VM statistics for full rmap
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This adopts Rik van Riel's recent extended VM statistics patch for the 
'armed-to-the-gills-kitchen-sink rmap' against 2.5.26.  The aim, in 
combination with a meaningful benchmark suite, is to be able to have the 
statistical ammunition to fine tune the VM properly, rather than twiddling 
all knobs at once hoping to make things better.

Rik's original announcement is here:
	
http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-mm/2002-07/msg00172.html
and I have added Bill Irwin's alterations to the patch, described here:

Given the late hour, I have almost certainly forgotten some hooks in 
vmscan, so count it as a first, harmless cut at the problem.  Feedback 
and fixes welcome! :)
For 2.5.27, I'll make sure this patch is incremental to Rik's stats patch, 
and not a replacement for it.  Sorry 'bout that...
