Cool - thanks. It probably doesn't get as much testing under memory 
pressure as it should on laptop-sized systems (though I do my best on
my own boxes). I'd be interested to see how it performs for people on 
desktop/laptops compared to virgin 2.6.0 - objrmap pays a little during
pageout for what it gains during regular usage. Just regular desktop
workload stuff, but measuring performance can be somewhat subjective
unless you have a more formal (and artificial) test. As long as it's
tangibly worse, that's fine.
Or if people are bored, and want something functional to test ... ;-) 
Fiddle with some of the new config options, eg turn on 4/4 split or 
2/2 split, or HZ=100, kgdb, kcg, schedstat, etc. Early printk is 
interesting too, but harder to test - you really need to make it
lock up before console_init somehow (adding a BUG() or something).
Thanks,
M.
