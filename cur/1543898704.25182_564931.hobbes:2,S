Tried it again with 2.6.22-rc7 + todays git. Still the same, this time 
it waited after loading PC speaker driver and before announcing tsc 
clocksource as not good enough, and pressing Enter made it continue.
Unfortunately I will be away from this computer for about 2 weeks so 
I can't test anything with it. It's still a regression but not worth 
holding up 2.6.22 for me if no one other sees it.
