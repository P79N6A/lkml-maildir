Oh yes I forgot to mention those didn't I.  :-/  The kernel is tainted
because of the !@#^%*#@* NVidia closed-source driver (1.0-3123).  I have
ALSA 0.9.0rc6 stuff loaded (yes, old; have yet to update it).
Everything else is stock 2.4.20 kernel stuff. (I am aware there is an
NVidia 1.0-4191 driver set, but  it didn't play nice so I reverted to
the previous release.)
Here is the lsmod output:
