Hi Mel-san.
This is very interesting feature.
Now, I'm testing your patches.

I met panic at here on my tiger4.
I compiled with CONFIG_SPARSEMEM. So, CONFIG_HOLES_IN_ZONE is not set.
pfn_valid_within() returns 1 every time on this configuration.
(This config is for only virtual memmap)
But, my tiger4 box has memory holes in normal zone.
When it is changed to normal pfn_valid(), no panic occurs.
Hmmm.
Bye.
