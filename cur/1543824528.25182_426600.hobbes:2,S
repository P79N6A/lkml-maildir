It seems to be xtime_lock.sequence:
main_timer_handler:
        pushq   %r13    #
        movq    %rdi, %r13      # regs, regs
        movq    $xtime_lock+8, %rdi     #,
        pushq   %r12    #
        pushq   %rbp    #
        pushq   %rbx    #
        pushq   %rbp    #
        call    _spin_lock      #
OOPS--> incl    xtime_lock(%rip)        # xtime_lock.sequence
        xorl    %r12d, %r12d    # offset

Once I've seen the NULL dereference, the rest are paging request errors.
Most of the time I'm on X, so I don't actually see output, but the ones
I've seen have been like that.
It starts somewhere between rc3 and rc4.
With the bisect, now I'm left with a bunch of SCSI patches which don't
seem to bear any relationship and which I don't use (except for
usb-storage).
