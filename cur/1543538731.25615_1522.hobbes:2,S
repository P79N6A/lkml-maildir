Actually, it is, look at how the memory init sequence goes.  There are only 
two other pages allocated before you get to smp_alloc_memory().  Here's the 
proof (putting a printk into setup_trampoline()).
CPU0: Intel Pentium Pro stepping 07
calibrating APIC timer ... 
..... CPU clock speed is 198.9541 MHz.
..... system bus clock speed is 66.3177 MHz.
trampoline base = (virt) c0002000, (phys) 8192
Booting processor 1 eip 2000
Calibrating delay loop... 397.31 BogoMIPS
[...]
I do agree the test lower down should be updated to use trampoline_base 
instead of phys_to_virt(8192).

It doesn't happen in the normal course of events.  For those of us who play 
with SMP HAL's, having this type of information can be invaluable.  Also, 
getting the machine to boot so you can try to find out what happened to the 
errant CPU is useful.  Usually it is just stuck somewhere like the message 
implies.
