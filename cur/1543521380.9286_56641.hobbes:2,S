It has to be maintained in the kernel (although a perfectly good
maintained user space tftp exists) 
The IP_PNP code had the tendency to break several times in the
2.1.x, so there is work involved.
If you start with tftp, the next guy wants DHCP (already happened)
and other enhancements. If you go this way you end up duplicating
a huge chunk of user space infrastructure in kernel. It just never ends.
Only because it is easy does not mean it is a good idea.
