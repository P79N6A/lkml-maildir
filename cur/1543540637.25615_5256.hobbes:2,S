	I'd love to believe this, but the actions of the gov't wrt copyright
law goes very much against this.  The Sonny Bono act which extended copyright
for another 20 years was totally retroactive.  The Gutenburg Project actually
had to remove some books that had put online because they came back under
copyright restrictions due to the Sonny Bono act.
	I have no clue if they'd try the same thing here.  Probably depends
on if some big business is pushing them.
