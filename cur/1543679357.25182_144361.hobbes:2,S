Sorry for the confusion. I think you're looking at the nbd code more 
from the standpoint of fixing problem areas and integration with the 
changes from 2.5. I've had my eye meanwhile on a more robust 
implemenation and enhanced design. The difference being that what I've 
submitted so far are just the changes I've needed along that path which 
also achieve the former target. But the changes clearly aren't ideal for 
the former perspective - in not being minimalistic changes. Just nobody 
else has completely fixed problematic areas of the driver liking locking 
races so I figure if the code also fixes these problematic areas it's 
worth sharing with this audience. YMMV of course.
