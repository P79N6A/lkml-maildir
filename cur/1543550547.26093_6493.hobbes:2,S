With that kind of general attitude, I suggest you stay well clear of
used car salesmen (in particular).

I'm not sure what you mean by asking questions, since submitting bug
reports generally involves providing some sample erroneous output or
proof of erroneus behaviour, and hopefully a patch (or patches) to fix
it.  To some extent it even involves being active on relevent lists,
helping others with their problems you've got a fix for, and getting
help from others who have fixed things you haven't.  I don't think I'd
be too wrong in saying most people here are the same, and have done/do
the above.
Also through lack of use I've unfortunately lost my fluency in German
and Japanese, so I'm stuck conversing in my native English (although I
apologise if I let any local slang slip through, I'm happy to clarify
off the list)
