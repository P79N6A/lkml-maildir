There are probably other cases of this in asm-i386/bitopts.h.  For instance
I think the "btl" instruction is pretty slow on modern CPUs so
constant_test_bit() will probably outperform variable_test_bit() even if
you feed it a non-constant "nr".  I'd be happy to be proven wrong, though :-)
When testing these optimizations you should also probably check the resulting
vmlinux size.
