Hi,
There are few races regarding the use of dentry->d_count
at various places as pointed by Trond. I have audited these and
made following patches for the places which I think are problemetic.
1. d_invalidate-fix.patch 
   - fixes race between d_invalidate & lockless d_lookup
2. nfs_unlink-d_count-fix.patch 
   - fixes race with nfs_unlink()
3. hpfs-d_count-fix.patch 
   - fixes race with hpfs_unlink()
Thanks,
Maneesh
