That's a new discovery, thanks.
It could be due to I/O scheduler changes.  Which one are you using?  CFQ?
Or it could be that there has been some changed behaviour at the VFS/pagecache
layer: the VFS might be submitting little hunks of lots of files, rather than
large hunks of few files.
Or it could be a block-layer thing: perhaps some driver change has caused
us to be placing less data into the queue.  Which device driver is that machine
using?
Being a simple soul, the first thing I'll try when I get near a test box
will be
for i in $(seq 1 16)
do
	time dd if=/dev/zero of=$i bs=1M count=1024 &
done
