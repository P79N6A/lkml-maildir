I am trying to diagnose a hard lockup. The only way I can reproduce it is
with mythtv. When the system locks up (no mouse, no activity in X, no message
logged) I can use magic sysrq, but I cannot see the output.
Using 'r' does not enable console switching. However 'b' will boot the
system, and I hope 's' and 'u' did something blindly.
I there a way to regain a text console in order to inspect the kernel?
I can connect a machine to the serial port if this will help - does
sysrq work though the serial port? Which software should I use on
the serial port (on the 'other' machine) for this purpose then?
Thanks
