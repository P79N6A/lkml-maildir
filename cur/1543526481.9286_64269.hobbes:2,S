It's been suggested. I gave it a try just now, but got oopses.
Possibly address space and/or unwanted optimization issues.
And how do I load one module from another, then unload it?
I settled for making the data module depend on the function module, but
not vice versa.  I then loaded the data module, which forced the
function module to load first.  The data module did its thing, and I
would have unloaded it next, but it oopsed ...
