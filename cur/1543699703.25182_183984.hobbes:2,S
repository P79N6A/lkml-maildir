Survived my greptest which no non patched kernel has ever done on this
machine.
Has anyone got that extended ringbuffer to work? I haven't been able to
get a complete "boot" dmesg in ages because of all the output all the
drivers make... Does it need a updated dmesg?
(I mean, is this like the non updated gnome-terminal in mdk 9.1 that
deadlocks on 2.6 if you run some ncurces apps in a "larger than usual"
window?)
