Thanks, the 3c59x patches are interesting, but they contain a few
_very_ discouraging comments. :-(
I might give the e100 patches a try, or borrow/buy an e1000 card--does
a "PRO/1000 MT Desktop Adapter" do it?
If I go the e100 route, does it matter much which chip the card is
built around?  (The CPU Saver feature seems to be available only on
82558/9, and I haven't found those yet.)
