Care to explain what this is useful for? (Not saying it's a stupid idea,
just wondering what the reason for doing it is).

Looks like this should be static.

You check if it contains fake=, not if it starts with it. So if someone
did: "numa=foo,fake=bar", or even "numa=debug,fake=", things wouldn't
work right.
