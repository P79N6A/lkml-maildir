Ohh please... First of all you have to make you patch correct, and only
after this think about tiny shiny error massages.
Lets look at original code:
              err = platform_device_register(&floppy_device[drive]);
              if (err)
                        goto out_flush_work;
              device_create_file(&floppy_device[drive].dev,&dev_attr_cmos);
<<<<<<<<< You propose  "goto out_flush_work" here if device_create_file() failed
<<<<<<<<< ,as it was done if platform_device_register() failed. But at the 
<<<<<<<<< moment we call device_create_file() platform_device_register()
<<<<<<<<< succeed, this means we have to unregister it first and only after
<<<<<<<<< this jumpto out_flush_work.
