Don't know what is really happening here but it looks like the mid
level ran out of memory when it tried to get heap for a
Scsi_Cmnd object, didn't check the result and passed the resulting
NULL pointer through to the low-level driver (advansys in this
case) that correctly complained. Bob Frey at Advansys is very
helpful (see the source) but my guess is it isn't his problem.
For what it's worth I have been bashing 3 varieties of advansys
adpaters (1540, 940ua and 940uw) quite severely since about
2.1.80 without any major problems.

Now this little number I know a lot about (cause I'm responsible
for it). You will get this if you use 2.2.2-ac6 or -ac7 or
2.2.3-ac1 with recent versions of cdparanoia. If you use 
2.2.3-ac2 it should go away. Alternatively you can go to
http://www.netwinder.org/~dougg
 and get the appropriate sg
patch (you need 2.1.7 or later).
