You misunderstand.  I wasn't saying it wouldn't work :)  I was saying
that it's been said repeatedly that evm should be implemented as an
integrity, not security, module.
I think it should be done as both.  The part which measures the
integrity of files should be an integrity subsystem.  The part which
uses those results to either allow/refuse actions or take some other
action (i.e. shut down the system) should be an lsm.
