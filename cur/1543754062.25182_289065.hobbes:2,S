Sorry, I take it back.  As Paul says:
: Wouldn't it be nicer to call the version that takes the order
: parameter "clear_pages" and then define clear_page(p) as
: clear_pages(p, 0) ?
It would make the patch considerably smaller, and our naming is all over
the place anyway...

I'd have thought that we'd want to make the new clear_pages() handle
highmem pages too, if only from a regularity POV.  x86 hugetlbpages could
use it then, if someone thinks up a fast page-clearer.
