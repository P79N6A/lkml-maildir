Hi,
I'm sorry to write here for a problem only about SMP: there used to be
a linux-smp mailing list but it seems it's not active anymore.
It seems AMD Athlon SMP spec is compatible with Intel's one; can
someone report that the A7M266-D motherboard with the 760 MPX chipset
is running fine linux SMP?
People reported that this combo works properly even with two Athlon XP's
instead of MP's: how do you force this motherboard into SMP mode?
I'm also looking for a ``howto'' explaining where non-SMP-aware module
code will most probably crash a SMP box, it seems there is no such
thing.
SMP gurus must have a discussion room more specific than linux-kernel
mailing list at some hidden place!
Sincerely yours,
