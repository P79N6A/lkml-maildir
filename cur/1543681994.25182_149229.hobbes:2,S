Hummph... I've intermitently been trying to make alsa work on the 
so-called AC97 chipset on my motherboard for something in excess of 2 
years now.  Alsa development has been at a snails pace and probably 
won't get to my current Biostar M7-VIB mobo before its obsolete.  
OSS?  Works out of the box, cost me IIRC a 20 dollar bill, and has 
been updated at least 10 times since I first paid the shareware fee. 
IMO money well spent.
If OSS does not work in 2.6, then it'll be a while before I'm doing 
2.6.  But I suspect it will be just fine by the time the real 2.6.0 
is out.
