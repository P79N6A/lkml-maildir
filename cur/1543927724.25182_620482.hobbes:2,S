Both are valid, which is the source of the problem. The API was designed under the assumption that hardware actually followed the register interface and didn't distinguish between byte and block transfers. Unfortunately, it seems to be quite common that they do. Your situation is a problematic corner case.

I'm afraid I don't follow. Do you want to add another parameter? Even if you do, sdio_io_rw_ext_helper() is an internal API. Changing it won't make things better for the function drivers.

Unless some hardware is quirky in the opposite way and needs to be able to do byte transfer of 256 bytes. Proper cards won't care either way, but as you can see, we can't support both types of buggy cards.

Ah. mmc_io_rw_extended() is indeed broken in that it can't do single block requests. That should be fixed.
However, it still won't affect what your function driver can do as mmc_io_rw_extended() is a bunch of layers down.
I guess I'll have to consider adding a more low-level API. The big problem with such a call would be that it can fail requests because the host or card cannot satisfy them. So a function driver using such an API would have to use a much more defensive programming (which can incur a performance hit).
