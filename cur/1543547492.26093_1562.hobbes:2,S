i believe such zero-copy send should only be allowed for drivers which can
guarantee correct checksums. (ie. cards which do Tx-checksums) The other
drivers will still copy. I dont think this is a problem - the number of
cards that can do scatter-gather DMA but cannot do TX-checksumming is
rather low. (i only know about the Tulip.) All modern cards do
TX-checksumming and scatter-gather DMA.
