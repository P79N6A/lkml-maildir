Well, it turns out this release had a few small problems:
* data=ordered deadlock on older kernels (including 2.6.23)
* Compile problems when ACLs were not enabled in the kernel
So, I've put v0.11 out there.  It fixes those two problems and will also 
compile on older (2.6.18) enterprise kernels.
v0.11 does not have any disk format changes.
