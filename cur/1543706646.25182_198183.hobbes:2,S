the only place I found using idr as-is is posix timers.  I haven't looked at
it's usage pattern much, but I assume it does use the pointers.  I guess
we're using up sizeof(void *) for every id we allocate, which is yuck.
Do we need to clone idr.c into bitmap.c and simplify?

That is the behavior that makes most sense, to me.

Is that really worth working around in such a gross way?  No offense to the
idea, but that's a pretty dumb bug to be hacking a failsafe for :)
