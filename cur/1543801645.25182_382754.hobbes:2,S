My patches are for going between Ingo's releases.  I've even released
2.6.15-rt1-sr2, for the simple reason I didn't notice that 2.6.15-rt2
was out :)
So I'll now download 2.6.15-rt2 and see where it's at. So my suggestion
is to always pick the latest -rt kernel, and if it doesn't work, try my
-sr patch for the same release.

I've added both Ingo and the lkml just so others know.  As the title
says, the -sr branch is only while Ingo is busy doing other things, but
I'll keep my branches posted anyways.
