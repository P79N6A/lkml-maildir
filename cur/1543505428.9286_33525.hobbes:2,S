I don't know, it seemed pretty obvious to me right from the beginning of
this thread that he was describing how you *could* use existing man, not
that it was already set up that way. Yes of course you'd have to move or
symlink your perl man tree from from /usr/lib/perl/man or wherever, to
/usr/man/manperl first, then man perl <something> would work like man 8
<something>  I'd already done this myself long long before this thread
ever came up anyways, I would have thought it was just one insignificant
aesthetic option completely beneath notice, let alone discussion, untill
I saw the discussion. :)
