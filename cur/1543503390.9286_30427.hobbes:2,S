I've thought so but I wanted to be as specific as possible
with the kernel description.

I made the grep but the result was empty.
grep -i jiffies /usr/src/linux.2.2.10/System.map

My /System.map is right now from kernel 2.3.10, but I booted
the 2.2.10 kernel and made the ksymoops therefore with the
/usr/src/linux.2.2.10/System.map. Was that right? Or do I have to
use the current System.map?

CPU is not overclocked and I could not reproduce the OOPS
yet.
I would like to test my memory, someone mentioned he has a
program that fills the memory and waits for changes or
something like this. Anyone has the program or remembers
where to get it? Thanks.
