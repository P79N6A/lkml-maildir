Cool, thanks for the testing.  Which benchmark are you using?  bonnie and
dbench don't show any changes on my scsi disks, I'll give IDE a try as well.

What I'm looking for is a separation of the write management (aging, memory
pressure, etc, etc) from the actual write method.  The lists (VM, buffer.c,
whatever) should do the management, and the FS should do the i/o.  This
patch is not a perfect solution by any means, but its a start.
