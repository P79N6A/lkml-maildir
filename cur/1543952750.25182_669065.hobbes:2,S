There were many threads related to that.
To summarize, the first purpose is to separate suspend (aka s2ram and standby)
callbacks from hibernation callbacks in such a way that the new callbacks won't
take arguments and the purpose of each of them will be clearly specified.  This
has been requested multiple times by many people, including Linus himself,
and the reason is that within the current scheme if ->resume() is called, for
example, it's difficult to say why it's been called (ie. is it a resume from RAM or
from hibernation or a suspend/hibernation failure etc.?).
The second purpose is to make the suspend/hibernation callbacks more flexible
so that device drivers can handle more than they can within the current scheme.
For example, some drivers may need to prevent new children of the device from
being registered before their ->suspend() callbacks are executed or they may
want to carry out some operations requiring the availability of some other
devices, not directly bound via the parent-child relationship, in order to prepare
for the execution of ->suspend(), etc.
Ultimately, we'd like to stop using the freezing of tasks for suspend and
therefore the drivers' suspend/hibernation code will have to take care of
the handling of the user space during suspend/hibernation which would be
difficult within the current scheme, without the ->prepare() and ->complete()
callbacks.

Sure, but that code won't be necessary otherwise too.
I'll remove the #ifdefs in the next version of the patch.
Thanks,
