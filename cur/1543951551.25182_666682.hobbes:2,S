Actually no - ramback would be useless to this. You might crash and end
up with untrustworthy on disk state - not worth the risk.

Oh you mean "pray hard". e2fsck works well with typical disk style
failures, it is not robust against random chunks vanishing. I know this
as I've worked on and debugged a case where a raid card rebooted silently
and threw out the write back cache.

I was suggesting that you want log structure for the writeback disk so
that you keep coherency and can recover it, an issue you seem intent on
ignoring in the interest of speed over any kind of practical usability.

 <- 504 GB ramdisk
Ok so almost nobody cares

No I get that. You've ignored the fact I'm suggesting that design choice
is dumb.

In a big critical environment - all three.
