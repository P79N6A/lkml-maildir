Well, the bug shall be fixed :)
Unfortunately I cannot reproduce this on my systems that are all based
on SUSE 10.1, and the latest 2.6.17-git works fine even
CONFIG_SND_DYNAMIC_MINORS=n as far as I've tested.
Could you check the strace and what open error occurs?
I suppose it's /dev/snd/controlC0, but don't figure out exactly.
thanks,
Takashi
