Documetation?  Is this a trick question?  It's Linux, of course there is
no current documentation except for the source  ;)
 /me ducks and runs   ;)

Not on 2.6 kernels, no.
[sparrow:joe] $ cat /proc/swaps
Filename                 Type            Size    Used Priority
/dev/mapper/vg0-swap     partition       8388600 0    -1
I use 4-8 G swap areas on 32-bit x86 and 64-bit amd64 kernels.
You probably need a new version of mkswap if it insists that 2G is the
maximum - it sure isn't a kernel limitation anymore.
