You're still guessing, a lot more things changed between 18-rc1-mm1 and 
18-rc1-mm2. It's rather unlikely that the timer changes fixed your 
problem. You might want to try to revert 
ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.18-rc1/2.6.18-rc1-mm2/broken-out/improve-timekeeping-resume-robustness.patch
to see whether the problem is back afterwards.
bye, Roman
