Overwriting syscall table entries is not safe. Its not safe because
there is no locking mechanism, and its not safe because of the pentium
III errata.

Not actually safely implementable. The right way to do this is a
relevant 2.5 question. In general however you shouldnt need to register
syscalls because the upper layer interfaces already exist (the LiS stuff
is an example otherwise I grant).
