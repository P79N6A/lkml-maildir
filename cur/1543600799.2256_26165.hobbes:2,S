Do you plan to submit the max_sectors changes to Linus & Alan?
Otherwise I will do as they seem to be needed for reliable operation.

Do we really need yet-another per-CPU thread for this?  I'd prefer to have
the context thread per-CPU instead (like in Ben's asynchio patch) and do
this as well.
BTW, do you plan to merge patches that actually _use_ this into your tree?

In my tree I also have an ia64 prefetch patch (I think it's from redhat,
not sure though), it's appended if you want to take it.

Of course it doesn't work. We've performed a software upgrade.
