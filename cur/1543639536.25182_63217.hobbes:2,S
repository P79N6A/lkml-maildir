I do not agree that it is enough to license it for 'GPL' use.  If there is
a license, it should impose no restrictions that the GPL does not.  There
is a big distinction.  Anything else, and the licensor is sending the message 
that they reserve the right to enforce against Linux users.
In other words, a license grant has to cover *all* uses of Linux and not just 
GPL uses.
In my opinion, RedHat has set a bad example by stopping short of promising 
free use of Ingo's patents for all Linux users.  We are entering a difficult 
time, and such a wrong-footed move simply makes it more difficult.
