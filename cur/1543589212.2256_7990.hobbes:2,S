[implementation details snipped]
While you are at this, you could make the .exit.{text,data}
sections swappable for modules (by allocating swappable pages fro
them?) and only mark them unswappable, while the module is
exiting.
Rationale: A device needed for swaping will never call exit
stuff, because it is still in use. So I see no obvious race here.
