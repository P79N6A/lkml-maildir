Jesper will try to do that ;-)

Well, I just checked my initscript that is run when going into
runlevels 0 & 6, and it does this :
(...)
# Kill all processes.
# INIT is supposed to handle this entirely now, but this didn't always
# work correctly without this second pass at killing off the processes.
# Since INIT already notified the user that processes were being killed,
# we'll avoid echoing this info this time around.
if [ ! "$1" = "fast" ]; then # shutdown did not already kill all processes
  /sbin/killall5 -15
  /bin/sleep 5
  /sbin/killall5 -9
fi
(...)
For the complete script, see here :

I'm trying to prove if it's a kernel or userspace problem, but it's
proving hard to reproduce reliably. But, what makes me suspect a
kernel problem is that I've never seen this with 2.6.17 and earlier
kernels, but since somewhere in the 2.6.18-rc series I've experienced
this "blue screen" problem once in a while and I've also had a problem
with the screen going all white when switching from X to a plain tty
and back (once it goes white it stays that way permanently until I
reboot) - I *never* see those issues when running 2.6.17.x and
earlier.
