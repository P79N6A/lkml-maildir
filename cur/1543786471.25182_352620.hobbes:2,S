Subject: [patch 13/18] USB: sl811-hcd minor fixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/22/53

From: David Brownell <david-b@pacbell.net>
Three minor sl811-hcd fixes:
 - Elminate memory leak on one (rare) disable/shutdown path.
 - For periodic transfers that don't need to be scheduled, update
   urb->start_frame to represent the transfer phase correctly.
 - Report the (single) port as removable, by default.
Since no drivers yet use start_frame or that part of the hub descriptor,
only that leak is likely to ever matter.
