Here's another attempt, which should at least fix #2 and hopefully #1.
If a break appears to have been active for more than one second, we
assume it's a new start-of-break.
Tested using SysRq on AT32AP7000. Seems to work well when dumping lots
of text to the console.

Subject: [PATCH] at91_serial: Fix break handling
The RXBRK field in the AT91/AT32 USART status register has the
following definition according to the AT32AP7000 data sheet:
    RXBRK: Break Received/End of Break
    0: No Break received or End of Break detected since the last RSTSTA.
    1: Break Received or End of Break detected since the last RSTSTA.
Thus, for each break, the USART sets the RXBRK bit twice. This patch
modifies the driver to report the break event to the serial core only
once by keeping track of whether a break condition is currently active.
Also, if an end-of-break appears more than one second after
start-of-break, assume that we missed the last one and treat it as a
start-of-break.
With this patch, SysRq works as expected on the AT32STK1000 board
with an AT32AP7000 CPU.
