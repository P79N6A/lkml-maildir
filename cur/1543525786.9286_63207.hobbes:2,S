Yes, it is, but when several processes are reading/writing large amounts of
data at the same time, the kernel should manage requests so that all processes
gets a balanced IO rate. The way 2.2.14 behaves is wrong IMHO, because one
of the N running processes have to wait until one the of others finishes its
work. IO time should be given to requests like CPU time is shared between
processes.
Can I call it "preemptive I/O" ?  :-))
Bye.
