On one of my machines, doing this causes the cardbus bridge to explode
on resume (every other character of printks suddenly starts getting left
out, and then the machine hangs). This happens even if I've never loaded
the yenta driver. The naive approach certainly doesn't seem to be safe
on all hardware.
