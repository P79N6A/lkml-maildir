Not without data flow analysis, and sparse really doesn't do that class
of checks...

Not by default it shouldn't; it's about the only way to do polymorphic
typechecking a-la "this argument of macro is a function pointer and
that argument could be legitimately passed to it", etc.

Dealt with below, but note that the wording in 6.7.5.2 is lousy: as stated
it covers not only intended sizeof(VM) with side effects in size expressions,
but sizeof(sizeof(int [n++])) as well, which certainly should *not* be
unspecified - the n++ is a part of operand of outer sizeof and it does not
affect its value (it's sizeof(size_t)), but it certainly should _not_ be
evaluated at all since the entire argument of the outer sizeof should not
be evaluated.
AFAICS, intended rules are:
	sizeof(expression of non-VLA type): constant, argument not evaluated
	sizeof(expression of VLA type): constant, argument evaluated
	sizeof(non-VM type): constant
	sizeof(VM type): unspecified whether all size expressions are evaluated

The really interesting question is what the hell did gcc folks intend for
their ({ ... }) and typeof extensions...  Well, aside of "some cases
when ({ ... }) would result in VM type are clearly undefined behaviour" ;-/
BTW, I wish somebody would have come up with a sane set of type-surgery
primitives...  Part of that can be emulated with typeof, but you don't get
"turn qualified-type into type" and "give the type of Nth argument of
function type" that way.
