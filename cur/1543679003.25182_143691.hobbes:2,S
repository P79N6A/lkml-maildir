Ouch ouch ouch, there's nasty merge conflict between the O_DIRECT patch
and an existing 64-bit rlimit chunk in -ac3.  You really, really want
the change below. :-)  Marcelo's tree appears OK, and this is a common
code path for all filesystems in -ac, so it matches the failure patterns
that far.
Cheers,
 Stephen
