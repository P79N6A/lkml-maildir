   Interesting, that about extended partitions. Anyway, I need them, cos I
   got DOS, linux and netbsd on my disk, and I can't squeeze all of them into
   the four primary partitions.
   Are you saying that though fdisk says /dev/hda5 starts at the same cylinder
   as my original /dev/hda6 started, it might actually be different at the
   sector level? (my disk is LBA, of course)
My guess is that's what happened; nothing else would explain what you
saw.  Use "fdisk -lu" if you must do that kind of partition manipulation
to make sure the sector numbers didn't change out from you.
One of the reasons why I don't like extended partitions is that they
work essentially using a linked list scheme, where the first block in
each extended partition is a partition table used to describe the rest
of the partition.  It's a very fragile data structure, and it's very
easy to get corrupted.  If you must use them, I'd strongly suggest
having copies of "fdisk -l" and "fdisk -lu" safely stored away somewhere
(say, taped inside the computer chasis) so you can recover if the
partition table (or some part of it) gets smashed.
