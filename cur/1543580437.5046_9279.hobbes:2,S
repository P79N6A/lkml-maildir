Hi,
I hope you can help me. I have a problem with my on board soundcard and
seti. I have a Gigabyte GA-7ZX Creative 5880 sound chip. I use the kernel
driver es1371 and it works goot. But when I run seti@home I got some noise
in my sound when I play mp3 and other sound. But it is not every time 10s
play good than for 2 s bad and than 10s good 2s bad and so on. When I kill
seti@home every thing is ok. So what can I do?
I have a Athlon 800 Mhz and 128 MB RAM
