cmd_err 35 is...

So, slow down the PCI-X bus.  It can usually be done from BIOS setup 
menu.  Does your machine has a riser board which extends or changes 
orientation of PCI-X bus?  Motherboard vendors describe the bus 
frequency limit when using riser boards in the manual but sometimes 
server vendors forget to set them.  Heck, some of them don't even know 
what that is.
