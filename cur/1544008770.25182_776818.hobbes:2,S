okay, i've applied it - but i dont like the extra complexity of +50 lines 
at all.
This is an area where the 'PID namespaces via struct pid pointers' model 
breaks down and forces collateral complexity into other subsystems, and 
where a simple integer based filter is so intuitive.
Eric, can you see any way to simplify this? It looks horrible.
