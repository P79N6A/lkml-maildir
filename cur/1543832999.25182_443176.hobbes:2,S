The point is not how trivial it is. The point is how much has to change
that you can run 2.6.42 on an 42 year old installation with the tools
that were available at that time.
Obiviously you cant be bothered to install newer packages, like kinit.rpm.
Basic backwards compatibilty. Its not a term from the klingon dictionary.
Btw, kinit is already taken, some kerberos thing.
