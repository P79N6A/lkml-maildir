Everything else is pretty much fine-tuning. Prior to this there was
zero control exerted over the things. Now it's much better behaved
with far less "swapping while buttloads of instantly reclaimable slab
memory is available" going on. Almost no swapping out of user memory
in favor of bloated slabs.
It's really that binary distinction that's most visible.
Cheers,
Bill
