As also shown in this thread: There are restrictions on what you can do 
between ll/sc. You would not want to use C code there. ll/sc is an thing 
that needs to be restricted to asm code. So this is not a viable proposal 
at all. ll/sc is useful to construct various atomic functions but cannot 
be directly used in C code. cmpxchg can be effectively realized using 
ll/sc.
