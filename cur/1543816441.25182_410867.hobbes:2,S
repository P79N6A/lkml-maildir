Actually the tricky bit is that there is no way to list resources
that processes share, except for by looking at the processes.  Changing
that has performance implications and is at least slightly non-trivial.
Given that the primary upside is better debugging I'm not a fan.
I would much rather modify the interfaces to have double counts
and work like the network devices.  Where you get warnings when
someone is still using the device after it has been made to
go away.
I appreciate the concern, and I share it.  I just don't think
that right now there is a good mechanism to get better visibility.
