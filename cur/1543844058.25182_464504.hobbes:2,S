Hi,
I compile the kernel and made a image and then installed the kernel, but 
unforunately i wasn't able to load into the operating system. It seems 
that they problem concerns the lack of initrd files. Btw i've made a image 
for the debian distribution as this is the one im using. Anyhow i used 
these commands.
make dep
make-kpkg clean
fakeroot make-kpkg --revision=custom.1.0 kernel_image
make clean
Then i get this image file title "kernel-imge-2.6.17_custom.1.0_i486.deb"
So how do i make one of those initrd files.
Any help would be appreciated.
Cheers,
Sleek
