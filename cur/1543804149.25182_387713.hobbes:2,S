To the best of my knowledge, the X-series docking station doesn't 
contain any PCI devices. It's an extension of the IDE bus plus some 
broken out serial, parallel, USB and so on. I'd expect driver support 
for it to just require supporting the dock object and calling its eject 
routine when the user hits the eject button.
