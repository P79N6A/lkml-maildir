Hmm..  But what it really does, then?
I used it one one machine which had a flaky CPU cooler,
to reduce power consumption during hot summer days.
It worked, and reportedly the frequency varied from
200MHz to the max of 2.4GHz (it's a P4 Xeon).  Now
I wonder why it helped to reduce the temperature and
why the system reported different frequencies...
Thanks!
