Being 20 megs into swap (and actively using it) might
be a bit extreme, yes...
Now about the patch:

I really don't believen that this patch is correct,
or even that it's very much better than the original
(clearly braindead) code.
With the (very) agressive readahead we're doing
now, a request queue of 64 entries really won't
be big enough any more. In fact, it'll only be
big enough for 2 to 4 'actual' requests.
The real fix would be to either increase the number
of requests to something more reasonable (say 128
or 256) and/or to be more intelligent about putting
more disk sectors into one request...
