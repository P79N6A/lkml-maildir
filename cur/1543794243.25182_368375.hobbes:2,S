We never used to.  They were, and for the moment still are, marked
PageReserved.  Prior to 2.6.15-rc we didn't refcount reserved pages,
but now we're trying to move away from PageReserved (some differences
of opinion how far to go), so refcounting them.
We're currently refcounting the ZERO_PAGE(s) simply because the
common case is refcounted: it would just be extra tests and code
NOT to refcount the ZERO_PAGE(s).  If they were a commoner case,
then it would indeed be worth avoiding refcounting them, but it
currently doesn't appear to be worth the effort.
But it is still up in the air: there is or may be an issue with
refcounts overflowing, and if it's clear that the ZERO_PAGE is
the only one vulnerable on any architecture, then I'm sure we'd
deal with it by not refcounting them.  However, I believe the
issue extends to mapped file pages too: though you need a huge
amount of RAM to reach overflow, so it's not something we need
to resolve this week.

Right.

Actually, they're not reverse mappable: we tend to find
there's not much gained by swapping out the ZERO_PAGE ;)
