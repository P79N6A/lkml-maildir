I don't really like the bit fields either. I inherited these structs and
I'm not adverse to changing them as you suggest to get rid of bit
fields.  But I think they are correct wrt endianness.  I wrote a test
program and on a LE machine it put the u8 first in memory followed by
the 24 bit reserved.  However, I think if you use bit fields less than 8
bits its not endian safe.
BTW:  I don't have a PPC system (yet) to test this code on BE...
Here's a dumb program that plays around with bit fields...
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <inttypes.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
struct foo {
	uint32_t 	a:8;
	uint32_t 	b:24;
	uint32_t	c:16;
	uint32_t	d:8;
	uint32_t	e:8;
};
struct bar {
	uint8_t		a;
	uint8_t		b[3];
	uint16_t	c;
	uint8_t		d;
	uint8_t		e;
};
struct bits {
#if 0 /* BE */
	uint32_t	a:4;
	uint32_t	b:4;
#else /* LE */
	uint32_t	b:4;
	uint32_t	a:4;
#endif
	uint32_t	c:8;
	uint32_t	d:8;
	uint32_t	e:8;
};
main()
{
	struct foo foo;
	struct bar bar;
	struct bits bits;
	uint8_t *cp;
	int i;
	foo.a = 0x01;
	foo.b = 0x020304;
	foo.c = 0x0506;
	foo.d = 0x07;
	foo.e = 0x08;
	printf("foo cpu: 0x%" PRIx64 "\n", *(uint64_t *)&foo);
	printf("foo mem: ");
	cp = (uint8_t *)&foo;
	for (i=0; i<8; i++)
		printf("%02x", *cp++);
	printf("\n");
	bar.a = 0x01;
	bar.b[0] = 0x02;
	bar.b[1] = 0x03;
	bar.b[2] = 0x04;
	bar.c = 0x0506;
	bar.d = 0x07;
	bar.e = 0x08;
	printf("bar cpu: 0x%" PRIx64 "\n", *(uint64_t *)&bar);
	printf("bar mem: ");
	cp = (uint8_t *)&bar;
	for (i=0; i<8; i++)
		printf("%02x", *cp++);
	printf("\n");
	bits.a = 0x1;
	bits.b = 0x2;
	bits.c = 0x3;
	bits.d = 0x4;
	bits.e = 0x5;
	
	printf("bits cpu: 0x%08x\n", *(uint32_t *)&bits);
	printf("bar mem: ");
	cp = (uint8_t *)&bits;
	for (i=0; i<4; i++)
		printf("%02x", *cp++);
	printf("\n");
}
