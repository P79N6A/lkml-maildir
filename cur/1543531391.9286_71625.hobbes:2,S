I have this exact same model of drive, and it has been problematic for me as
well.  I can read cdroms fine.  I can't rip them, however.  I also can't
write.
I applied your patch, but it actually made things worse.  Running 2.2.14, I
couldn't write to the drive at all.  Running 2.2.15pre15, I could mkreiserfs,
or mkfs.ext2, but couldn't write any data.  The scsi bus would disconnect
itself.
2.2.15pre15 with your patch applied actually made mkfs.ext2 appear to try to
write beyond the end of the device, and spewed 1000s of errors across my
console.  And after a couple of minutes of this(ctrl-c did not work), the scsi
bus was offline, and nothing responded.
I can say that you patch does not appear to affect normal operations.
