ioctl interfaces with pointers in them are generally a bad idea,
though you handle most of the points against them fine here
(endianess doesn't matter, padding is correct).
Still, it might be better not to set a bad example. Is accessing
the MSRs actually performance critical? If not, you could
define the ioctl to take only a single entry argument.
A possible alternative could also be to have a variable length
argument like below, but that creates other problems:
+struct kvm_msrs {
+       __u32 vcpu;
+       __u32 nmsrs; /* number of msrs in entries */
+       struct kvm_msr_entry entries[0]; /* followed by actual msrs */
+};
This would mean that you can't tell the transfer size from the
ioctl number, but you can't do that in your code either, because
you do two separate transfers.
