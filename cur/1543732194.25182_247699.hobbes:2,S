But would thousands care? Seriously?
For example, you could make just _one_ program support "openat()", and 
you'd get most of the advantages, with no possibility of _breaking_ any of 
thousands of applications..
I know, you've ignored the "runat" program (which is just a wrapper around
the openat() system call), but it _has_ been mentioned several times in 
this thread. Yes, you'd type a bit more to do
	runat file ls -l
instead of
	ls -l file/
but at least the openat/runat approach also works for directories, which 
does actually make it a lot more _generic_ than the "show in the regular 
filespace" approach. No special cases.
So your comparison isn't valid, because you're ignoring the people who
shout "runat" at you. You've also not ever actually answered about the
problems about directories with attributes.
