I think the point is that khttpd works with any webserver software. It
doesnt try to do everything it just tries to do one thing (serve static
files, a very common operation), and do it as optimally as possible, while
dropping dynamic stuff eg cgis etc off to userspace daemon.
Switching webserver software is not always an option, no matter how nice
Zach Brown's httpd might turn out to be.
In this case khttpd becomes very desirable since it can squeeze a lot more
performance out of a system for very little effort, in a completely
transparent way.
khttpd is also attractive for embedded systems 8)
