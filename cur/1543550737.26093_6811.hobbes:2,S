FWIW, i810_rng -used- to use an internal variable for 'use_count', and
maintained MOD_{INC,DEC}_USE_COUNT off of that.  I decided to get clever
and do the above, thinking that module.h was completely ok for the
non-modular case.
GET_USE_COUNT breaks the build on Alpha (hence the #ifdef).  Further,
for this driver at least, it depends on a -working- module count for
all cases, returning 1 would not be sufficient.
prumpf has since sent me a fix patch which goes back to manually
maintaining the use_count for the static case, and that is the solution
I'm going with...
