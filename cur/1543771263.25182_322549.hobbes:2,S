How about anything more? The truth is that much common hardware doesn't 
really make the cache to disk move visible, and turning off cache really 
hurts performance. And it would appear that fsync force a lot more data 
out of memory than just the blocks for the file in question.
However, the point I was making is that it would be useful to be able to 
tell when the write to non-volatile took place, not to force that to 
happen. Not to do anything which would flush a lot of other stuff and 
busy the drive. What I suggest is NOT fsync, just a way to assure ordering.
