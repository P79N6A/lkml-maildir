Trust me, it is.
The particular problem _you_ had with it is only a small small part of the 
bugs we have had.

No. You really don't see the big picture. There's been tons of problems 
with MMCONFIG. Like the fact that other devices have their IO regions 
registered on top of it, because the MMCONFIG thing was done as a hidden 
resource. Or the fact that the area claimed was too small. Or too large. 
Or not listed at all.
The whole thing is a total disaster. I told Intel engineers literally 
*years* ago to not do that idiotic "hidden IO resources that are described 
by firmware that then inevitably gets things wrong", and yet what happens? 
Every single time.
