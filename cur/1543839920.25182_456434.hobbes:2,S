Nope, not all code paths which access the data which is protected by
workqueue_mutex take cpu_add_remove_lock.
Simplifying it, we have:
	blocking_notifier_call_chain()
	->down_read(cpu_chain.rwsem)
	->workqueue_cpu_callback()
	  ->mutex_lock(workqueue_mutex)
	->up_read(cpu_chain.rwsem)
	blocking_notifier_call_chain()
	->down_read(cpu_chain.rwsem)
	->workqueue_cpu_callback()
	  ->mutex_unlock(workqueue_mutex)
	->up_read(cpu_chain.rwsem)
Which is OK as long as nobody runs cpu_up() or cpu_down() while holding
workqueue_mutex.
