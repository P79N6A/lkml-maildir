I think that the syscall man pages can document the behavior mode flag
for folks who want to use the "raw" interface.  I think we already
recommend the use of libnuma APIs.  [If not we can make it so, if folks
agree.]  
So, we default to old behavior in the raw syscall APIs--we MUST, right?
"no breaky user APIs..."--and let new version of the library/ies enable
new behavior when appropriate.  Even a "new syscall", such as the
set_mempolicy2(), et al that you suggested, could be just wrappers over
the existing ones with the behavior mod flag.  Or vice versa.
