I am running 2.2.1 on an intel pentium MMX 233 MHz mobo intel TX 430, 96
mb ram SCSI NCR53c825 ... Redhat 5.2 updated to the day ... 
After exiting (quiting not changing virtual console to the text console
from the X one) from XFree86-3.3.3.1-1 to the console the ps/2 mouse hangs
up and needs to be killed to restart ... actually doesn't totally hang up but 
doesn't keep the marked buffers and it also marks parts of the screen with
the button that sould paste ...
The mouse works great in XFree86-3.3.3.1-1 ... even when mouse on console
is screwed up...
Strange is that it happens often on some users and rarely on others (all
non 0 uid gid users)
