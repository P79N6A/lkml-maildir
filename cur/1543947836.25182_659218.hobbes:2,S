I ever asked marcel about the coding style. please see following thread:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/22/91
I think the style problem marcel said is
1. using kernel codeing style
2. marcel's style
container_of or get_user_data calls at the top of the variable declaration
using the empty lines to seperate code blocks
Please rework your patch and resend if you fixed them.
BTW, please use the new bluetooth mailing list for kerne issue.
