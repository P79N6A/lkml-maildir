I don't know.  I confess that I don't clearly understand the problem
yet.  It sounds like the sensor drivers want to talk to hardware that
ACPI methods might also use.
But I missed the details, such as the specific devices in question,
which ports they use, how they are described in ACPI, which AML
methods use those ports, and which non-ACPI drivers also use them.
It also sounds like the non-ACPI drivers provide much more
functionality than ACPI exposes.  I'd like to understand this,
too, because an  obvious way to solve the problem would be to
drop the non-ACPI drivers.  Is this extra functionality available
on Windows?  If so, do we know whether Windows uses non-ACPI drivers
or whether they have some smarter way to use ACPI?  In the long
run, I think the easiest, most reliable route would be to use the
system in a similar way.  Then we'd be doing things the way the
manufacturer intended and we'd take advantage of all the Windows-
focused firmware testing.
