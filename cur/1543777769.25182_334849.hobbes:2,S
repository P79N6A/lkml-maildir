Yes, you're adding a jump to another function via a function pointer,
that would kill the cache line of execution, to avoid a simple check, or
some other way of handling it. Since I don't want to know the internals
of relayfs, the overwrite mode could be implemented in a more officient
way. Granted, this probably isn't much of a slowdown since the copying
of data would be much longer.

The overwrite mode isn't that complex.  You don't want to make something
so flexible that it becomes more complex.  Assembly is more flexible
than C but I wouldn't want to code a lot with it.  A library function
for me is out of the question, since what I build on top of relayfs is
mostly in the kernel.  The overwrite mode would then have to be
implemented through another kernel activity.  I might as well keep my
own ring buffers and forget about using relayfs, and all my points in
which I argue for it being merged is mute.
