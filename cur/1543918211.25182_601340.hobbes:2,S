No, not at all.
I'm proposing that the existing bzImage format be retained, but that the 
payload of the decompressor (already a gzip file) simply be vmlinux.gz 
-- i.e. a gzip compressed ELF file, notes and all.  A pointer in the 
header will point to the offset of the payload (this is new, obviously.)
The decompression stub is adjusted to expect an ELF image, instead of a 
raw binary.
Existing bootloaders (16- or 32-bit) simply load the bzImage the way 
they do now; new bootloaders have the option of accessing the vmlinux.gz 
directly if they either want to load it themselves or want to examine 
the notes.
