This is a real linker problem on ppc32.  The linker automatically adds
_SDA_BASE_ and _SDA2_BASE_ symbols, these symbols are not defined in
vmlinux.lds.S.  The SDA symbols move around as kallsyms data is added
between phases 1 and 2.  That movement, together with the stem
compression (which depends on the immediately previous symbol) means
that the compressed symbol table changes size between phases 1 and 2,
which it is not supposed to do.
This problem has been there all along.  It showed up now because I
added a test to verify that the kallsyms data is consistent after phase
2, instead of blindly assuming that it is stable.  jhf, can you verify
that this patch removes the need for an extra kallsyms pass?
--- kallsyms-ppc32 ---
PPC small data area base symbols shift between kallsyms phases 1 and 2,
which makes the kallsyms data unstable.  Exclude them from the kallsyms
list.
