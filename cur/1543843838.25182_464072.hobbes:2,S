indeed, and i severely misunderstood your points in this regard. Now i 
have re-read some of your earlier points, and in particular:

and now i'm red faced - i was wrong about this fundamental aspect of 
your position. Please accept my apologies!
so regarding the big picture we are largely on the same page in essence 
i think - sub-issues non-withstanding :-) As long as LTT comes with a 
facility that allows the painless moving of a static LTT markup to a 
SystemTap script, that would come quite a bit closer to being acceptable 
for upstream acceptance in my opinion.
The curious bit is: why doesnt LTT integrate SystemTap yet? Is it the 
performance aspect? Some of the extensive hooking you do in LTT could be 
aleviated to a great degree if you used dynamic probes. For example the 
syscall entry hackery in LTT looks truly scary. I cannot understand that 
someone who does tracing doesnt see the fundamental strength of 
SystemTap - i think that in part must have lead to my mistake of 
assuming that you opposed SystemTap.
