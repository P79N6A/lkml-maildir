I will, and will do so happily. I don't like the uint*_t types as well.
This change was pushed very heavily for by Brad Hards, based on a
conclusion of a rather lengthy discussion (I think on linux-usb) on
which types should be used.
Now the question remaining is how to fix that? You can just skip the
patch. I've tried a 'bk undo', but that complains about unmerged leaves
in that case (though really nothing depends on those changes). Or should
I just make another cset on top of all the previous?
