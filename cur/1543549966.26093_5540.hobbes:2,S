The VFS is inherently object-oriented.  Each filesystem works by
overriding a few methods stored in function table structs.  The MM is
well on its way to being object-oriented - check out 'struct
address_space'.  I haven't gotten into it much yet but I gather the
various buses are also organized in much the same way.  On the whole,
Linux is very object-oriented, but it's not C++-oriented.  The bad news
is you don't get any class syntax support from the compiler, you have to
write it all out by hand; the good news is that you tend to be well
aware of exactly what code is being executed to do a given job.
