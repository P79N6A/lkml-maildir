I used  free_pages((ULONG)card_ptr->dma_blk0[n], max_order); before Roman 
changed it. And still do for minor 26 now...

Thats why I don't like it so much. But it seems I must do it for some strange
reason:
On minor 26 I do it the old way, on minor 27 I use Romans fix. What shall I say:
Reading and writing to the buffer allocated with Roman's fix so far never
crashed the system. But doing it the normal way (minor 26) how I also learned it
from A. Rubini's book, 
does harm to the system.
After usage of the normally allocated buffer the strangest thing occur:
- Issing w caused a dump on the console once.
- Halt doesn't really halt the system completely
- Reboot caused everything to hang, partitions still dirty...

Oh yes, indeed! But:
Is there a guarantee that the n - 1 pages above the 1st one are not donated to
other programs while my driver uses them?

Yes. The FW on the card demands it.

I'll move the code to init_module later once it is stable.
