Subject: [PATCH] 2.6.14-rc5-mm1 net/ipv4/route.c: spin_unlock call fails to compile
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The spin_unlock call which gets an rt_hash_lock_addr(i)
argument fails to compile on rc5-mm1 uniprocessor with
no CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK because, in mm1, the spin_unlock
macro expands to a statement of the form:
do { (void)&ptr->raw; } while (0)
and 'ptr' is 'NULL'.  Since the expression is address-of
(therefore not evaluated as an r-value - i.e. no attempt
is made to load the non-existent raw, just take its address)
this expression is harmless.
The patch makes 'ptr' ((spinlock_t*)NULL), which the compiler
can compile (sizeof *ptr is 0 in the case - the spinlock_t
struct is empty - so the patch is particularly safe.)
The patch applies to both 2.6.14 and 2.6.14-rc5-mm1 (although
only the latter requires it.)
