Hi
Anyone successfully installed kernel 2.4.0-test6-pre1?
Something dramatic seems to have changed since test5, because I get a whole 
pile of not found error messages from depmod -a
like /lib/modules-2.4.0-test6/....... module not found
plus a lot of other file system type error messages.
Can anyone enlighten me as to what has changed.
Thanks
