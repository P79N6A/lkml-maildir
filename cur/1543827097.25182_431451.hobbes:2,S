No, the entire point is that you stop backporting all the junk, and just 
leave ext3 as is.  Let it sit, let it stabilize.
New development -- including inode slimming work -- can be best done in 
ext4.  With ext3, you are fighting all those old back-compat features 
and associated code paths bloating up the in-core inode [code].
_Obviously_ there may be bugs found in three codebases, rather than two. 
  But over time those will trickle off, particularly when developers 
successfully resist the urge to continue modifying ext[23].
There will always newer, bigger storage situations and arrays, and I 
think it's a mistake to continue modifying the same Linux filesystem to 
support all these situations.  The logical end result is a big, unwieldy 
codebase that supports $N metadata, data, and journal formats.
In the same way we don't stuff support for all PCI ethernet or SATA 
drivers into the same .o file, we shouldn't keep stuffing support for 
all these varying filesystem formats into ext3.o.  That creates (and 
extents exacerbate) the "what ext3 fs am I mounting, today?" support 
problem.
