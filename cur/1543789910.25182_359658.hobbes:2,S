I am not familiar with the PCI subsystem, thus cannot advise how to 
handle it best nor wanted to post a patch myself (yet).

It seems to me, using the .callback and .driver_data doesn't make it 
cleaner and leaner.

It is necessary; at least if the workaround resides in ohci1394. 
Otherwise the controller won't come back after a suspend/ resume cycle. 
(See Rob's post from February, 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?m=110786495210243 ) Maybe there is another 
way to do that if the workaround was moved to pci/quirks.c.

pci_set_master(dev) can be moved below the second part of the Toshiba 
workaround. That means AFAIU, the 2nd part of the Toshiba workaround can 
be moved out of ohci1394 into pci_fixup_device() which is called from 
pci_enable_device(), to be called as a DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_ENABLE hook.
The first part of the workaround, i.e. caching the cache line size, for 
example by means of a static variable, would have to go into an 
_FIXUP_EARLY, _FIXUP_HEADER, or _FIXUP_FINAL hook. I am not sure yet 
about which type of hook to use.
Furthermore, everything which belongs to the workaround should IMO be 
enclosed by #ifdef SOME_SENSIBLE_MACRO. This avoids kernel bloat for any 
target which is surely not a Toshiba laptop. Rob used an #if 
defined(__i386__).
