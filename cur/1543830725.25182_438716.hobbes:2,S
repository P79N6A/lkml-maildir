Yeah, you'd have to do something like
	struct _urb *_urb = container_of(urb, struct _urb, urb);
first. However, it also turns out that some other code-paths are _also_ 
filling "urb->transfer_buffer", and those are indeed using a kmalloc'ed 
buffer (hci_usb_isoc_rx_submit()).
So the proper thing to do is probably along the lines of
	static void free_transfer_buffer(struct urb *urb)
	{
		struct _urb *_urb = container_of(urb, struct _urb, urb);
		if (_urb->priv) {
			kfree_skb((struct sk_buff *) _urb->priv);
			_urb->priv = NULL;
			urb->transfer_buffer = NULL;
			return;
		}
		kfree(urb->transfer_buffer);
		urb->transfer_buffer = NULL;
	}
or whatever. I dunno. I ended up just uncommenting the "kfree()" in my 
code, to see that it doesn't oops any more (and it doesn't).
