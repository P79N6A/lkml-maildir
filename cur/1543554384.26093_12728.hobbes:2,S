Not "wrong" exactly, but not "best" either.
Look in the MAINTAINERS file of a recent kernel source tree, look for
references to NFS, and see if any mailing lists are suggested.
You should find
   nfs@lists.sourceforge.net

The client side support for nfs/tcp is all there in late 2.2.18
pre-patches, and patches for earlier kernels are available.  See
   
http://nfs.sourceforge.net
for details.
Client side support is also in 2.4.0 test releases.
The server side is much less mature.  I believe that when 2.2.18 comes
out it will have nfs/tcp server as a 'experimental' compile time
options.  Much of the same code is in 2.4.0-testX, but I don't think
the compile time option is there, you need to edit the code to enable
it.
