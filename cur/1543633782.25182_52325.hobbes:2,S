Another piece of low hanging fruit is probably dmi_scan.c
There are no workarounds there for either (are they even DMI compliant?)
so compiling it in doesn't make much sense.

if neither visws or voyager need it, I'd say it doesn't belong in the
respective subarch directories period.

Yeah, I think mach-foo would be more aesthetically pleasing, so I'll
cast my vote for that one. If nothing else, it makes it obvious that
the subdir isn't important if you don't care about $subarch
