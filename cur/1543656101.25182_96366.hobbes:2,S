I have been working together with a few of the architecture maintainers.
Could you do a new version that will left out the following architectures:
sparc and ia64.
The changes are on the way from the architecture trees anyways, and this
would just result in too many rejects.
Otherwise thanks for the nice work, I hope you had some smart way to do it.
