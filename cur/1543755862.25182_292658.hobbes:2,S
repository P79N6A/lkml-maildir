There are a lot of possible problems with your actual hardware. Like
Interrupt handling, power control, dma, ... Those are seldom but possible.
Notebooks tend to require some special handling.

A failure of the bus or a former sporadic error can cause defective fs, but
normally you have a read error in fsck no structure error.
Are you using hdparm? is the system perhaps overheating or overclocked?
