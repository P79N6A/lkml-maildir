Care to elaborate? What happens when you read that file? And why does it 
cause an error even when the disk is not currently being accessed? As I 
said there can be considerable time between running my script and 
accessing the disk. And why do I get different errors depending on whether 
I access the disk before I run the script or run the script before I 
access the disk?

Who is this General Failure,
and why is he reading my disk ?
