I'm again getting lockups when opening an Xterm from a windows box to my
2.2.0final box. Previously (2.2.0pre3 - 7) this didn't occur. Now it is
again. According to magic sysrq key, IP was around
cc822014 NS8390_init    [8390]
(the actual values flucuated from cc82228b to cc822292). 
SMP, 2x pentium 2, NE2K, modules, ide. More info upon request.
G'day!
