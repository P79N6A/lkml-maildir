Andrew, 
If we stick with git it might make sense not to include a linux-patch.  cogito
is quite fast to export using a commit id.  Suspect some bandwidth could be 
saved if you just stated the commit id that you based the mm patch on.
In case anyone is wondering how build this from a cogito/git db...  Find the
cogito announcement on lkml install and update cogito.  Then folliw the instructions
in the README and download the kernel's db.  Next search lkml to find the commit id 
of rc3 (a2755a80f40e5794ddc20e00f781af9d6320fafb) and verify you have it correct 
with:
cg-mkpatch a2755a80f40e5794ddc20e00f781af9d6320fafb
then export a tree with
cg-export ../12-3-1 a2755a80f40e5794ddc20e00f781af9d6320fafb
and cd over to the new dir and patch with mm and have fun.
Thanks
Ed Tomlinson
