Actually, in the filemap_sync case, the flush_tlb_page is redundant --
there's already a call to flush_tlb_range in filemap_sync after the dirty
bits are cleared.  None of the cpus we support document having a writeback
tlb, and intel's docs explicitely state that they do not as they state
that the dirty bit is updated on the first write to dirty the pte.
