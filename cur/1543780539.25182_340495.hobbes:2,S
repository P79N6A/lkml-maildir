Hi,
I have 2 identical dual 2.8ghz xeon machines with 4gb ram, using
software raid 10 with lvm layered on top, formatted with JFS (though
at this point any filesystem with online resizing support will do). I
have the boxes stable using 2.6.10, and they pass my stress test. I was
trying to update to 2.6.12 so I can use the new ionice utility, but I'm
experiencing oopses again. Can someone take a look at my info and give
me an idea of what is causing my problems. I'm willing to test patches
if anyone cares to work with me on a fix.  All the details can be found
here:

Please CC me on replies, as I am not subscribed to l-k.
Thanks for your help.
