Another side effect of syncookies is that flow control for new
connections breaks: when you have a client that is connecting to a
overloaded server it will only notice this after a long timeout. With
syncookies off you get actually useful errnos back on connect().
(overloaded here doesn't necessarily mean DoS, just e.g. a single threaded
service that is taking a long time to do some job and expresses this
with a small argument to listen())
