Hey folks,
The last thing I was going to try to do to get my system working with Athlon 
optimization was to flash my BIOS to the latest rev.  Unfortunately, I 
discovered that my BIOS was apparently locked and would not take an update.
My motherboard is the Epox 8KTA3+, and I'm running an Athlon 1.4GHz.
Epox was kind enough to mail me a new BIOS chip to replace my locked chip.  This 
chip contained a version of the BIOS that I believe was dated 8/6/2001 (I don't 
feel like rebooting again to find out).  Suffice it to say, that version is not 
listed on their website, but there is an even newer one.  For anybody with the 
8KTA3 or 8KTA3+, the BIOS page is located at 
http://www.epox.com/html/english/support/motherboard/bios/8kt3.htm
Anyway, I was running the BIOS dated 3/5/2001 up until now.
The point to all this is that with the newer BIOS, my machine is now up and 
running absolutely fine with Athlon optimization turned on.
Happy day (well, as happy as a day can be this week)
