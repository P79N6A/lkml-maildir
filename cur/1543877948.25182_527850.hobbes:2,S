The interrupts can only happen when the other CPU is already lazy
and enter_lazy_tlb would be a nop then.  The flushers itself are
synchronized by the page_table_lock or the mm semaphore.
Against switch_mm it tries to protect with ordering.
wmb()s are not needed on x86 (ok minus errata on ppro and
VIA magic mode but which is UP only). That would leave some rmb()s,
but I don't see any place they would be needed.
