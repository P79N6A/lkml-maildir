You assume wrong.
The Pre-Loader or "freed-symbols" is to return symbols that were once
EXPORT_SYMBOL which are now openly renamed EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL.
This is open thieft of the kernel API.
So I welcome you and your lawyers to sue me for making a GPL module which
allows free use of the stolen symbols.  Please come to California and lets
party.  Since it is an original work as a new module, regardless if it is
derived or not, being GPL and source available you lose ... Have a nice
day.
Cheers,
Andre
