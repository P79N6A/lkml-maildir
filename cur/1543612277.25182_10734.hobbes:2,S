   Just switched back to the DGE550T. A kind person wrote me that there
is an updated from D-Link in the works that solves the timeout problem,
and sent a copy of the beta driver. It has solved the problem at this
time. Wasn't just a problem with transfers with MSWin, apparently that
was a red herring (it just triggered it for me).
