Convention is that he who breaks an API fixes up the majority of the
mess caused or does it by consensus with the other developers. 
Of course if your code is out of tree nobody will know so it'll just
break.
For example the last time I edited the wdt501 watchdog I submitted
according to my logs is about 1998. Since then each person who broke an
API it used fixed it up, or the janitors did shortly afterwards.

Do you have measured performance data, economic models and statistical
evidence to back up the claim or is this that well known bad idea called
"conventional wisdom" ?

Why not. By the time it gets that big you'll have over 1TB on your phone
let alone a PC. The kernel development structure is optimised for
development.
