If you have difficulties in believing this, may I ask you how you think it
is possible for a non-journaling filesystem to prevent this at all?

What you see is most probably *old* data, not data from another (still
existing) file.

all filesystems ;)

ext2, reiserfs.

ext2, reiserfs.

this shouldn't happen on reiserfs. however, the unwritten parts of file a can easily
contain data formerly in file b.

this should be prevented by journaling (of course, this won't help against
harddisk failures) on reiserfs. ext2 often has this problem, but fsck usually
can repair it. it's easy to tell metadata from filedata on ext2.

remember that the blocks have previous content, and reiserfs' tails
optimization means that files appended all the time (wtmp) can move around
rapidly (at least their tail).

this can make a big difference. many disks (ibm, maxtor) nowadays write
partial blocks on power outage, this gives "Uncorrectable read errors",
which is fatal, because no filesystem so far can work around this. It's
easy to repair (just rewrite the block), but would requite filesystem
feedback (hey, reisrefs, this metadata block is *garbage*).

no. and it doesn't make sense. but it's not forbidden or sth.
