Hi,
   I am inserting a module(device driver) using insmod. 
I want to send a message from this module to an user process.
For this I used msgsnd with buffer in the call as a local 
variable.  I am getting an error "EFAULT" for this call. 
However this did not happen when I made the driver code as a
part of kernel and not as a module.  Any idea about what could
be the problem and how to solve it?
TIA
Regards,
Vijayalakshmi
