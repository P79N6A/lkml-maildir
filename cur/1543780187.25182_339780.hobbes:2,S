Hi,
this is letter from sangoma:
<cite>
the sdla.c is not Sangoma's file :) or if it is it should be erased.  
The sdla.c
has not been used since 2001.
It is true that wanpipe drivers are not part of linux 2.6 kernel.  We have
been so busy developing that there is no way the linux kernel could
keep up with the changes.
Bottom line we have to put a whole new wanpipe driver into the kernel
source, and that is a big task.
It is much easier for us to ask people to use our drivers from the web.
Once the wanpipe drivers stop changing so fast we will be able
to push the new release into the kernel.  It doesn't make sense to do it 
now
because if anyone wants to use wanpipe, that person would have to
get the latest drivers from the web!
</cite>
So what do you think we would do?
Add some lines to Kconfig with address of ftp sangoma?
Delete old version from the tree and wait for the new one?
