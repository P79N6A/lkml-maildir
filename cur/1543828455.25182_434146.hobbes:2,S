What does that last line mean?  what does "external" mean?
There are no other source files in the 2.6.17 tree that say
anything like that.
And of the 1800+ MODULE_AUTHOR() lines, SGI seems to be
dominant is using company instead of a person for AUTHOR.
Yes, there are a few others as well.
module.h says:
/* Author, ideally of form NAME <EMAIL>[, NAME <EMAIL>]*[ and NAME <EMAIL>] */
