Your right, the sysctl handler should be smarter, but that is not the problem here.
The problem is that the default value is set to be BIC to be compatible with earlier kernels.
Since 75% of the world isn't smart enough to figure out how to use sysctl, there is a
question of what the default should be, and what to do if that is missing.
One version had a messy ifdef chain to try and avoid the warning:
char sysctl_tcp_congestion_control[] = 
#if defined(CONFIG_TCP_BIC)
	"bic"
#elif defined(CONFIG_TCP_HTCP)
	"htcp"
#else
	"reno"
#endif
	;
but that was ugly.
Another possibility is putting it in as yet another config value at kernel build time.
To suppress the warning repeating, probably the best solution would be rewrite the string
if we have to revert to reno. But carefully to avoid SMP issues.  This also implies a smarter
sysctl string handler for this value as well.
P.s: saw your comparison paper, after a little more corroboration I would like to make
H-TCP the default.
