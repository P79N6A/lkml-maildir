this is userspace doing "eth name by MAC address", your new card has a
different MAC address than your old card, the userspace application
tries to bind each name uniquely to an ethX name so it keeps eth0 free
for your old card.
If you have a RH/Fedora like distribution, you can hack out the mac
address from the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 file

it's obviously not the proper solution :)
it's odd though; it could entirely be a bios bug. you may want to file
a bug at bugzilla.kernel.org against the acpi component, and make sure
you include the full dmesg of a boot at least...
