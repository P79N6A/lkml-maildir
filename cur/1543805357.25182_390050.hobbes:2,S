Hmm, I guess it never made it due to size.
Below is the description I initially wrote for the patch and the patch
itself is attached as a bzip2 archive so it will hopefully make it to
you.

Ok, I went into drivers/scsi/megaraid.c just to fix a few compiler warnings,
but ended up doing a big spring-cleaning.
I'm sorry this patch is not split into one patch pr logical change, but I
did everything in one go from the top of the file to the bottom and
splitting the changes after I was done would have been a big task in itself.
Since all the changes are pretty trivial I hope it'll be acceptable as-is,
but if not then let me know and I'll try and split it up.
Here's a summary of the changes made :
 - CodingStyle & Whitespace cleanups, incl. removing excessive blank lines.
 - Merge some printk's.
 - Remove some pointless casts.
 - Remove some pointless initializations of variables to 0.
 - Merge some variable initializations.
 - return is not a function.
 - Remove unneeded variables.
 - Fix two warnings ;
    drivers/scsi/megaraid.c:3660: warning: ignoring return value of
`copy_to_user', declared with attribute warn_unused_result
    drivers/scsi/megaraid.c:4473: warning: unused variable `flags'
