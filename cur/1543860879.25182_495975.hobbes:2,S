You could just write-back invalidate the whole cache
periodically if there is no explicit hardware support
for cache scrubbing.  Less efficient, sure :-)

Shouldn't you spell your name correctly (with capitalisation)
in the sign off?  It being a formal thing and all.
Some spelling and coding style nits:

"map maps"

"bandwith"
And please just write "greater or equal".

i = 0;

Why not?

Space before the newline.

So fix it :-)
