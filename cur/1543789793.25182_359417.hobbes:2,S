No it's not. It needs to decrement the preemption counter and test it.
See kernel/spinlock.c:
	void __lockfunc _spin_unlock(spinlock_t *lock)
	{
	        _raw_spin_unlock(lock);
	        preempt_enable();
	}
	EXPORT_SYMBOL(_spin_unlock);
and look at what "preempt_enable()" does.
In other words, with CONFIG_PREEMPT, your patch is WRONG. You made 
"spin_unlock()" just skip the preempt_enable.
In fact, with preemption, the _locking_ is the simpler part. Unlock is the 
complex one.
