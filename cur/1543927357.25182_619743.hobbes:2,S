No.  We can change virtio though, so let's have a flexible ABI.

That means the user has to select which device to expose.  With feature 
bits, the hypervisor advertises both pio and hypercalls, the guest picks 
whatever it wants.

Why so unlikely?  Not all workloads will have good batching.

But... it's tricky, and it's nonstandard.  With pci config, you can do 
live migration by shipping the pci config space to the other side.  With 
the special iospace, you need to encode/decode it.
Not much of an argument, I know.
wrt. number of queues, 8 queues will consume 32 bytes of pci space if 
all you store is the ring pfn.
