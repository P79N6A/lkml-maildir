OK, I found another difference with 2.4.
Try "echo 256 > /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes", I think
that should give the same free watermarks that 2.4 has.
Using 1MB as the min free watermark for lowmem is bound
to result in more free (and less used) memory on systems
with less than 128 MB RAM ... significantly so on smaller
systems.
The fact that ZONE_HIGHMEM and ZONE_NORMAL are recycled
at very different rates could also be of influence on
some performance tests...
