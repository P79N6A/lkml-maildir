Oops, guess original sent was too big for lists.  This time, include
link to patch.
Attached is a (link to a) forward port of the sparc64 kdb patch to v4.2
of kdb.  It is still rough around the edges, but it at least builds and
boots and is somewhat usable.
You must apply the kdb common patch and the patch to kdb common I sent
earlier to get it to build properly.
Enjoy!
