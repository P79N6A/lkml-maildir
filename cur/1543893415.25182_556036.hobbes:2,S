My plan is to define dedicated sections for both __devinit and __meminit.
Then we can apply the checks no matter the definition of CONFIG_HOTPLUG*
But we are a few steps away form doing so:
1) All harcoded uses of .init.text needs to go (at least done in assembler files)
2) The arch lds files needs to be unified a bit too.
Then we can during the final link stage decide if __devinit shall be merged
into .text or .init.text (after applying the modpost checks).
But do not hold your breath.
The even more important precondition is to sort out all the current
section mismatch warnings. But here we are getting close.
