hi here, i have this problem with rp-pppoe (not kernel mode pppoe):
connection is ok, but 2.6 is slow to authenticate (exactly 20 seconds instead of
less then 1 second of 2.4).
any 2.4 kernel:
Dec  1 12:55:18 Axis pppd[2995]: pppd 2.4.2 started by root, uid 0
Dec  1 12:55:18 Axis pppd[2995]: Using interface ppp0
Dec  1 12:55:18 Axis pppd[2995]: Connect: ppp0 <--> /dev/pts/0
Dec  1 12:55:18 Axis pppoe[2996]: PADS: Service-Name: ''
Dec  1 12:55:18 Axis pppoe[2996]: PPP session is 41955
Dec  1 12:55:19 Axis pppd[2995]: PAP authentication succeeded
any 2.6 kernel:
Dec  1 12:56:47 Axis pppd[6249]: pppd 2.4.2 started by root, uid 0
Dec  1 12:56:47 Axis pppd[6249]: Using interface ppp0
Dec  1 12:56:47 Axis pppd[6249]: Connect: ppp0 <--> /dev/pts/0
Dec  1 12:56:47 Axis pppoe[6309]: PADS: Service-Name: ''
Dec  1 12:56:47 Axis pppoe[6309]: PPP session is 42019
Dec  1 12:57:07 Axis pppd[6249]: PAP authentication succeeded
note last two line timestamp.
same machine/connection/modem/kernel config..
is possibile to have a 2.4-like connection performance? thanks.
