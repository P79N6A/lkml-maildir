Would someone be kind enough to explain the difference between 
tcp_keepalive_intvl and tcp_keepalive_time?  
Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt says tcp_keepalive_time is the interval 
between sending keepalive probes, but doesn't mention tcp_keepalive_intvl...
A quick grep through the source code says tcp_keepalive_intvl wanders through 
keepalive_intv_when which is used in tcp_keepalive_time in a way that sort of 
implies it's the timeout between keapalive packets.  So what's 
tcp_keepalive_time?
The problem I'm trying to track down is ssh connections where the connection 
times out but the session doesn't go away until a key is pressed.  (I.E. 
blocking reads don't notice the connection going down underneath them, not 
even if left overnight.)
It's kind of frustrating, actually...
