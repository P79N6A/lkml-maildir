What should the API for this look like? We could add a VGA={0/1}
attribute to all the VGA devices in sysfs.
But then how do you:
1) list all of the conflicting VGA devices in a domain?
2) turn off all the VGA devices in a domain?
We could build a bus like directory structure in /sys/class
/sys/class/vga/domain1/vga1/(device/driver/enable)
/sys/class/vga/domain1/vga2/(device/driver/enable)
/sys/class/vga/domain2/vga1/(device/driver/enable)
/sys/class/vga/domain2/vga2/(device/driver/enable)
Then add an enable attribute in the domain directories that would shut
off all of the subdevices.
/sys/class/vga/domain1/enable
/sys/class/vga/domain2/enable
But the vga driver is not going to be attached to a device. Is there an
easy way to build this is sysfs?
