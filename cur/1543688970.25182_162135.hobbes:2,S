The two are maintained separately now.  This is changing a file location 
to make things a bit more convenient for dontdiff users; it's not 
radically changing anything, technically or politically.
If there are persons that consider the presence of dontdiff in the tree 
a maintenance headache, then those persons should not patch dontdiif. 
Problem solved :)  It's a file that's not going change often.

People are thinking _way_ too hard about this.  This is just plunking a 
rarely-changing file into the kernel tree.  Even implying some sort of 
maintenance hassle is making a mountain out of a molehill.
