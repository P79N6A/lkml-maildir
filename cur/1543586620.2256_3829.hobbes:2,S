It sounds like the kernel is stuck somewhere in a tight loop, so nothing
is being rescheduled.  If you have an SMP system (or an APIC) you may be
able to see where it is stuck with the NMI watchdog timer.

Actually, this is not true.  Reiserfs will only prevent corruption of the
filesystem metadata.  It does not guarantee that the file contents are
valid if they are being changed when the system crashes.
