But "select" is not fine grained enough.
I would like to have "require", "recommend", "suggest" for feature A.
require X
	does not work without X, but X is way down the tree 
	e.g. ext3 and block device or how select currently is intended
recommend X
	it is usable but uncomfortable without X, enabled per default
	e.g. firewalling recommends connection tracking support 
	or NAT recommends all NAT helpers
suggest X
	many people use A together with X, 
	so you might be interested in enabling it, but I disabled it
	per default unless you said "featuritis mode" before.
	e.g. highmem and SMP or a network driver and NAPI.
That is what the Debian/Ubuntu package management does and maybe other too.
And this also gives us new keywords to replace select with, 
so migration is doable :-)
This would also make "EMBEDDED" superflous, because it would just mean 
"disable anything not required". 
And this would enable an individual tree for the users current configuration 
problem instead of a global one.
