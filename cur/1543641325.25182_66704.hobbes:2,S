I still don't agree, nothing in the _PCI_ force you to have
only 3 resources. a PCI 2 PCI bridge has 3 resources, here we
agree, but absolutely _nothing_ prevents a host bridge for
exposing more than one memory range, and that DOES happen
in a few real world cases like on pmac.
So we have this situation:
 - Most of the common PCI code can deal with an arbitrary
number & ordering of resources in the pci_bus structure
 - The pci_bus structure already holds 4 resource pointers
 - Copying the all 4 instead of just 3 will not have any
side effect on machines that expose only 2 or 3 host bridge
resources.
I really don't understand your point here. Nothing defines
that a host bridge has to comply with the resource layout of
a PCI<->PCI bridge, why limit ourselves arbitrarily here ?
Especially since we _already_ have 4, not 3 resource slots
in the pci_bus structure...
Ben.
