Hello,
I faced the same problem with the VM System on an S/390-System and Kernel
2.4.7 + S/390 patches. As there is hardware ECC-checking it is not a memory
problem.
I can reproduce the problem If I put load on the system (256 MB RAM, 512 MB
SWAP on a file, 3CPUs).
To reproduce this behaviour I run a lot of programs which consume all the
heap memory.
The C++ program uses the new function until the OOM killer is activated.
I start several of this programs with nohup prog &
This behaviour startet with 2.4.7.
With all previous Kernel versions since 2.4.0 there were a kernel BUG
messages during this test. The messages changed regularly with every new
kernel version, unfortunately we were not able to track this problem down.
Kernel 2.2 runs fine.
