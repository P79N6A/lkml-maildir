Sure, the I/O completes, but the buffer_head is still in memory, valid and
uptodate.
On a subsequent mount the super_block comes from memory not disk. This works
as long as nobody else mounted that file system in between. 
I can make the changes needed. I was really curious if you, or anyone else,
thought there might be page caching issues involved with invalidating on the way
down.
Thanks the time,
Phil
