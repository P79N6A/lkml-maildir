Hmm, I always use alsa for my GUS PnP card, since it has much better
support than the crappy old GUS driver in the kernel (and from OSS).
I don't actually use the card anymore since I got an SB Live instead,
but it used to work well.  The static hiss on the card is due to an IC
defect, and may be masked by the use of the GUS emulation, but I find
that hard to believe.  Also using the correct speed ram helps a lot
(70ns or faster).
