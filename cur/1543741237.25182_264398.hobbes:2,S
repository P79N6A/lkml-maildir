Just some information.... Most of these external USB and/or
external Firewire disks such as ACOM, etc., contain an
EIDE (ATA) hard disk plus an adapter board with a
USB or IEEE sequencer. These sequencers can be a pain
in the ass because they do 8-bit math. It may be necessary
to artifically constrain the per-operation data-length
with this in mind.
Cheers,
