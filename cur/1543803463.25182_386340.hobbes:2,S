Subject: Suggested janitor task - remove __init/__exit from function prototypes

Some function prototypes (in both .h and .c files) specify attributes
like __init and __exit in the prototype.  gcc (at least at 3.3.3) uses
the last such attribute that is actually specified, without issuing a
warning.  So we can have :-
* Prototype declarations that use one attribute and a function body
  that uses another attribute.
* Functions that from the .c code appear to be normal text but the .h
  file is silently setting a special attribute.
Both are potential sources of programmer confusion or bugs.  I suggest
a janitor task to find all function prototypes that use __init, __exit,
__devinit, __devexit, __cpuinit or __cpuexit and remove the attribute
from the prototype.  If the function body does not already specify a
suitable attribute then add the attribute to the function body.
The same task could be done for extern data declarations.
Once that is done, remove #include <linux/init.h> from all .h files.
Only .[cS] files should specify which section the data and text are
stored in, .h files should only define the C language information.
