Interesting... Mouse and joystick are very low-bandwidth interfaces
(actually that's *the* reason of my dislike towards them - point'n'click
may be fun, but for editing give me vi and a decent keyboard). How does
this stuff work for the keyboard? I have vi in my fingers - serious
type-ahead is norm. If this channel can provide comparable bandwidth
and lower latency than fingers+keyboard... I'ld like to play with it.
Another problem being the noise, indeed. It's easy to keep it low on 
the fingers+keyboard combination, but I'm not so sure about the EEG-type
stuff...
