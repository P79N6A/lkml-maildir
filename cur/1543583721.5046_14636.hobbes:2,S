Maybe, maybe not.
Short story: CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE is broken on three machines I run,
including one laptop. It actually _prevents_ the CPU from "idling".
Long story: While working on the UP-APIC patch I was trying to figure
why I was seeing a near-perfect 100Hz NMI count on an otherwise idle
machine, while other people were seeing much lower rates. An idle
machine is supposed to "hlt" frequently, which also suspends UP-APIC
NMI generation.
As it turned out, I had CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE=y in my .configs. So
apm_mainloop() dutifully called APM_FUNC_IDLE whenever it felt the
machine was idle. Problem is, APM_FUNC_IDLE doesn't actually _do_
anything on these machines [maybe apm_bios_call_simple() is buggy,
maybe the BIOSen are, I don't know]. So instead apm_mainloop() was
sitting there in a tight loop calling APM_FUNC_IDLE like crazy:
my 800Mhz Coppermine was doing 1.3 million of these calls per second,
and kapm-idled was taking >95% of CPU time [sound familiar?].
After I disabled CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE the Coppermine is running about
15 degrees C cooler than before. kapm-idled takes almost no CPU time
since it basically just sleeps waiting for APM events. The kernel's
regular idle loop "hlt":s the box most of the time between timer irqs.
It's easy enough to check if you've got a broken CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE:
define a counter, increment it in apm.c:apm_do_idle(), and print
it at the end of irq.c:get_irq_list(). On an idle machine, cat
/proc/interrupts, sleep 5 seconds, and cat /proc/interrupts again.
Note the difference in the apm_do_idle() counter.
Similarly, you can also add a counter to process.c:default_idle()
to see how often the kernel "hlt":s.
