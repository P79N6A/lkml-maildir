Subject: problem with md_thread??? missing unlock_kernel()?

Hello.
i was looking at some samples for usage of kernel_thread, and saw that it
calls lock_kernel()
other usages of lock_kernel() always follow with a unlock_kernel() which
seems the right thing to do..
so is drivers/block/md.c missing a unlock_kernel() call before it allows the
creator to continue with an up(&sema).?
Also is there any guidelines on when to use lock_kernel()? guess thats what
iam looking for...
Cheers,
ashokr
Plug-and-Play is really nice, unfortunately it only works 50% of the time.
To be specific the "Plug" almost always works.
