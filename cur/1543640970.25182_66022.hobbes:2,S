The problem can be anywhere, actually.  #4 (and other file I/O) is the
best bet though, I suspect.
It is caused by any mismatched locking - it is a good debugging check
regardless of preemption.
The only known place I or others see it now is on shutdown, since we
have kernel threads that do not drop the BKL and other locks when they
shutdown since the system is about to halt anyway.
There was some reports of XFS earlier... I thought they were fixed (I
talked to those guys).  Maybe some other rogue module...
