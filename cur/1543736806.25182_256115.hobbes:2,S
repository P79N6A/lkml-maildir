Hi Greg,
Here's an updated version of my hotplug environment variable patch.
Based on Paul Jackson's suggestion, I switched the helper from a macro
to a function.
When I wanted to implement some environment variables in my hotplug
method, I looked for an example of how to do it.  I noticed two
things: adding values ends up being kind of messy, and the hotplug
method in drivers/usb/core/usb.c is subtly wrong!  These two patches
attempt to fix both of those problems.
If you apply these, I'll send patches to use add_hotplug_env_var() in
net/, drivers/ieee1394/, etc.
Thanks,
  Roland
