Local NBD is good for when the content you want to make available
through the block device is dynamic (generated on-the-fly),
non-linear or supersparse.
Take for example VMware virtual disks. Just a guess, but
they roughly can look like this:
  kilobytes  0.. 1: header
  kilobytes  1..10: correspond to LBA 0..20
  kilobytes 11..20: correspond to LBA 40..60
  kilobytes 21..22: correspond to LBA 22..23
So what we have is non-linearity -- LBA 22 comes after LBA 40 -- loop
does not deal with that.
And there is supersparsity -- the VMDK file itself is complete, but
unallocated regions like LBA 24..40 are sparse/zero when projected
onto a file/block device, respectively; loop cannot deal with that
either.
In fact, VMware uses local nbd today for its vmware-loop helper
utility, most likely because of the above-mentioned reasons. (Though
it quite often hung last time I tried.)
