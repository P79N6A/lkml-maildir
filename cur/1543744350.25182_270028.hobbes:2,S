Without addressing the question of whether stacking modules makes sense
in the first place, I'd like to note a couple of things which caught my
eye:
> +static int stacker_register (const char *name, struct
> security_operations *ops)
> +{
> +	/* This function is the primary reason for the stacker module.
> +	   Add the stacked module (as specified by name and ops)
> +	   according to the current ordering policy. */
> +
> +	char *new_module_name;
> +	struct module_entry *new_module_entry;
> +	int namelen;
> +
> +	num_stacked_modules++;
> [...]
> +	return num_stacked_modules-1;
> +}
Unless I've missed it, you never check num_stacked_modules against
CONFIG_NUM_LSMS.  If somebody loads too many modules, they risk
overflowing all of those void * security arrays you've added to so many
kernel data structures, and thus corrupting those structures.  That, in
technical terms, would be a bummer.
In stacker_unregister(), you do:
> +	num_stacked_modules--;
What happens if you unload anything other than the last module, then
load something else?  When you return num_stacked_modules-1 to the new
module, you'll point it to a slot in those security arrays which is
already used by another module.  The result seems unlikely to improve
security.
Unless I'm simply confused?  It's happened before...
