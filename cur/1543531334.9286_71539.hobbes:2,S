That depends what kind of suspend.  If I shut the lid of my laptop, I do
_not_ want it to spend 5 seconds swapping before it can save the 4MB of
video state.  That's what suspend-to-disk is for.  But when I shut the
lid, I want sleep , which means there's enough power to retain the
memory (including VRAM) but devices like USB controllers are powered
off.
