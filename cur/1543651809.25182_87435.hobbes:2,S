Hard disk is sdc on onboard AIC7xxx.
Writer is hdc, the only device on the secondary onboard IDE channel.
All other disks (IDE & SCSI) were idle during the test.
Source image for the burn was on sdc3 and a directory on the same
partition was also the target for the 'dd'.
The system was exhibiting the usual spotty ext3 large writeout behavior
as has been discussed on the list before. Basically, vmstat 1 looks
something like this (captured from a different test on a different
machine but shows the same pattern):

Will do when I get home (now +9 hrs or so)...

No sweat. I've got three spindles of blank media left. ;)

thankful CD writer testing is no longer so expensive.
