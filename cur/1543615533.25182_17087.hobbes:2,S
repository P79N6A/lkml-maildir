Stephan,
Here is what I've run thus far.  I'll add nfs file copy into the mix also...
System: SMP 466 Celeron 192M RAM, running KDE, xosview, and other minor apps.
Each run after clean & cache builds has 1 more setiathome client running upto a
max if 8 seti clients.  No, this isn't my normal way of running setiathome, but
each instance uses a nice chunk of memory.
Note: this is a single run for each of the columns using "make -j2 bzImage" each time.
I will try to run aa and rmap this evening and/or tomorrow.
Martin
