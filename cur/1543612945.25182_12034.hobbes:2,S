Yes, but agpgart will not let more then one driver use it. So it will be
_either_ 3d or video capture with switching upon Xserver restart. Sucks !

Does this imply that the driver must be compiled into the kernel ? In that
case I'll need to allocate at least 2meg of ram for each capture card..

Yes, I almost went all the way rewriting the code in accordance with
DMA-mapping.txt thinking I am using "non-DMAable" memory or something 
until I noticed that all the functions are inlined to trivial for x86.
