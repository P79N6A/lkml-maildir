let me qualify that: parameters must be prepared there too - but no 
actual function call inserted. (at most a NOP inserted). The register 
filling doesnt even have to be function-calling-convention compliant - 
that makes the symbolic probe almost zero-impact to register 
allocation/scheduling, the only thing it should ensure is that the 
parameters that are annotated to be available in register, stack or 
memory _somewhere_. (i.e. not hidden or destroyed at that point by gcc) 
Does a simple asm() that takes read-only parameters but only adds a NOP 
achieve this result?
