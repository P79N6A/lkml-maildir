Subject: [PATCH] Fix race in do_get_write_access()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

  Hello,
  attached patch should fix the following race:
     Proc 1                               Proc 2
     __flush_batch()
       ll_rw_block()
                                        do_get_write_access()
					   lock_buffer
                                             jh is only waiting for checkpoint
					     -> b_transaction == NULL ->
					     do nothing
                                           unlock_buffer
    test_set_buffer_locked()
    test_clear_buffer_dirty()
                                           __journal_file_buffer()
                                        change the data
    submit_bh()
  and we have sent wrong data to disk... We now clean the dirty buffer
flag under buffer lock in all cases and hence we know that whenever a buffer
is starting to be journaled we either finish the pending write-out
before attaching a buffer to a transaction or we won't write the buffer
until the transaction is going to be committed... Please apply.

The test in jbd_unexpected_dirty_buffer() is redundant - remove it.
Furthermore we have to clear the buffer dirty bit under the buffer lock
to prevent races with buffer write-out (and hence prevent returning
a buffer with IO happening).
