as discussed on the power management summit: this is the wrong approach.
The BIOS gives you these tables. The reference bios has all of them, but
if a testing failure (for example due to voltage regulator limits or
cooling limits) a specific machine can't do a certain state, the bios of
that machine drops that state. It's a BAD IDEA to then add that state
back via the back door!
It's not as if the bios people remove random states... that's work. They
only change such things if they really really have to...
