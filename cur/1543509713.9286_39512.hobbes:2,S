Well, my target is that V34 demod will go in user space, possibly with
no real time requirement.
For modulation, it's possible that we could keep the hard stuff in user
space, but with something in the kernel to insert idle frames should the
Tx buffer underflow.  I think that's better than dropping the line which
_might_ happen with a cheap modem on the other end.  Fabrice says V34
modulation is not that complex.  But a few things I've read give me a
feeling that he might not have solved all the problems yet ;-)  Things
like frequency precompensation at the Tx end for example...

That is on my todo list :-)
