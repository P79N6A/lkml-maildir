Sure.  But given that I've given the reporter only two options:
a) Tell me it's fixed or
b) take it to bugzilla
I don't think there's much of interest to anyone else.  If the reporter
chooses to be awkward and starts going into details then yeah, cc's need to
be re-added.

No, I can miss stuff.  And there are lots more mailing lists.  Many of
them for drivers, which is where most of the bugs are.  
So please don't let me discourage you from doing this - if a reporter gets
multiple emails regarding a bug, he's unlikely to be offended - it's heaps
better than zero emails!  I'll cc you in future if you like so we can avoid
duplication.
