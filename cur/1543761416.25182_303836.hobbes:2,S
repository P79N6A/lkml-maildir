Does the link side of PCIE provides a way to trigger a hard reset of the
rest of the card ? If not, then it's dodgy as there may be no way to
consistently "reset" the card if it's in a bad state. I have to double
check, but I suspect that IBM's implementation of EEH-compliant PCIE
will add a full hard reset not just a link reset.
