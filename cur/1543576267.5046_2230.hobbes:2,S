-512 means that the recv was interrupted by a signal, or rather, the
current process has a signal maybe the recv was interrupted, maybe there
is a problem with the connection, better reconnect.
Still, it's better than pre-2.2.18 where smbmount wouldn't stay alive ...
I don't really know how signal delivery works within the kernel, but
smb_trans2_request tries to disable some signals. That does not work
(completely?) so either it needs fixing or the -512 errno needs to be
handled.
Why so bad in gdb? perhaps it causes more signals.
Why does one thread end up in D state? don't know.

A small testprogram that causes this would be nice. The -512 is easy to
reproduce but I haven't seen the 'D' before.
If someone is interested the relevant code is fs/smbfs/sock.c
(smb_trans2_request, ..., _recvfrom)
