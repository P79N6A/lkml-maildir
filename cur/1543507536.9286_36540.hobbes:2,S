Hi, 
while searching for the reason of bad sound, I found another bug in the
driver.
When I play sound with wavplay and then killing wavplay (either by
typing CTRL-C or the kill command) and starting wavplay again, it
sometimes doesn´t play sound and select times out after 5seconds (the
timeout I gave for when no file descriptor is ready). 
This problem doesn´t occure everytime, but when the problem occured,
retrying to start wavplay will always fail.
strace tells me that nothing was written to /dev/dsp. /dev/dsp just is
not ready (select tells this to the program) and thus my program doesn´t
try to write to /dev/dsp.
I can solve this problem as well with two extra lines:
      ioctl(sound, SNDCTL_DSP_SYNC, 0);
      ioctl(sound, SNDCTL_DSP_RESET, 0);
With these two lines the program does not hang in the select call. After
successfully playing the file the old wavplay works again, too.
This problem is not a critical problem but it is a flaw which should be
eliminated.
Greetings, Michael

Yes, I remember you. 
My name is Michael not Micheal... Many people I know wrote my name wrong
- does the name Micheal exist in French or English?
