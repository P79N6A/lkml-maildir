hello all,
  I am new to Linux .
 I am looking for provisions in linux Kernel or Linux User Space  through
which i can read  data directly from
serial port (A device is Connected to Serial Port).
  I read the literature regarding Raw Sockets but could not figure out 
 how to read data from serial port.
   If there is any URL where i can find  information regarding this please
mail me that also.
Thanks in Advance.
 Bye
Anil
