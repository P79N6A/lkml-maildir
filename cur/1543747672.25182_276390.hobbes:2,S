I seriously doubt a complete list exists, NDA or no.  You'd have to poll 
each vendor.
I also suspect that a few of the more recent Seagate additions are 
simply masking a problem in the BIOS.
SiI 311x problems have a history of resolving themselves through BIOS 
updates and tweaks.  Most recently a lockup was solved by tweaking a 
'byte enable' setting in an nForce mobo BIOS.
