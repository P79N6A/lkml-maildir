Hello!
> this is the strict fix:
Andrea, you caught the problem!
The fix is not right though (it is equivalent to straight
tp->send_head=NULL, as you noticed. It also corrupts queue in
an opposite manner.) Right fix is appended.
Explanation: in do_fault we must undo effect of enqueueing new segment
in the case the segment remained empty. tp->send_head points to
the first unsent skb in queue and it is NULL when and only when
all the skbs are already sent. (Invariant is: tp->send_head==NULL ||
tp->send_head->seq == tp->snd_nxt)
I crapped this case except for the case when queue is completely empty,
so that the last sent skb was accounted in packets_out twice...
Damn, what a silly mistake was it... shame.
