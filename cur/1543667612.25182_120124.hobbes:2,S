Snare won't really help you. In fact older snare tends to make a box
less secure. The rework looked good but I've not had time to do a
detailed review and I believe they've been busy working on other
projects too.
If there is no UML or debugging done on the box, stick "return -EPERM"
at the start of sys_ptrace and just disable the entire debug/strace
feature set.
