I think Andi Kleen suggested something similar to this:
You could enhance a file /proc/<pid>/stat (or some other, or invent a new
one) to export a VM cookie (sorry, working with Mark made the word
"cookie" my favourite one and I can't think of a better :) which is
nothing other than a current->mm value, i.e. a kernel virtual
address. Then you can easily detect CLONE_VM threads.
