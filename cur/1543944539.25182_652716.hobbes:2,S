I'd rather say what Sun did with their disklabels was rather unfortunate :)
But yeah, new filesystem should cater for it's braindamage because it
doesn't have any kind of runtime cost at all.   XFS was designed for
IRIX back then which had disklabels just like the SUN ones, just without
the braindamage of having the disklabel inside the partition..
