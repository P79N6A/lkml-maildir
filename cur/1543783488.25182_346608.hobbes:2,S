Hello all together, 
for now i can confirm, that the problem disappears!
I have done the following:
First try the msr fix, this doesn't solve the problem entirely, but
there were no kernel panics.
With the randomize_va_space setting the general protection disappeared
too ...
I'm now happy and will go for holiday ( 4 weeks *g*). After that i will look
if the machine gets some problems back, but i don't think ...
I thank you all for your help!
