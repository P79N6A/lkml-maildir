Sorry, I'm not answering your question but I do have a comment.
A month or so back 3ware discontinued _ALL_ their 3ware Escalades, the 
6xxx and the 7xxx, they have since then recieved so many mails that 
they've restarted development, support and production of them.
With one 'minor' issue, they're discontinuing their 6xxx (32bit) series 
of cards. So I would recommend getting the 64bit 7xxx series directly 
instead.
