I see. The choice between the comment and the 'break' can be left
to the author, maybe he knows what is the best one (the one that will
let us add a new case with less effort).
If you bother setting a styleguide rule, I believe the latter is more
common.
But still I dislike semicolons *after* comments. Why not:
	case a:
		...
		; /* fallthrough */
	case b:
		...
		; /* fallthrough */
	}
It looks just a little less ugly to my eyes (please take a few seconds to
get used at it), maybe it's because it's reminiscent of shell
double-semicolon. In general, I find it more readable when comments
are somewhat "outside" the C code.
[ Note: I still put it after the first case, both for documenting the
fallthrough behaviour, which is a good thing anyway, and to allow
deleting the last case with no thinking of it. ]
I'd even put a tab before the comment.
	case b:
		...
		;	/* fallthrough */
	}
Ok, that's really a matter of taste. You spend more time in front
of the source than me, and you know better. I'd like you to set a kind
of rule, because it's something that many are not used to see and it's
easier to recognise it if it looks the same everywhere.
