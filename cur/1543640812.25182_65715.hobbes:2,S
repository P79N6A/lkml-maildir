I checked the source tree for the stock m68k port.  The only systems that
implement the KDKBDRATE ioctl are the amiga and atari ports, and they both
do it in accordance with the documentation and the kbdrate program (and
the patch I submitted earlier).
The relevant routines are drivers/char/amikeyb.c:amiga_kbdrate() and
arch/m68k/atari/atakeyb.c:atari_kbdrate().
