At a first look, i thought about locking gdt-related data. But in a
closer one, it seemed to me that we're in fact modifying a little bit
more than that in the resize code. But all these modifications seem to
be somehow related to the ext3 super block specific data in
ext3_sb_info. My first naive approach would be adding a lock to that
struct
Besides that, by doing that, we become pretty much independent of vfs
locking decisions to handle ext3 data. Do you think it all make sense?
