Hi all
Following my own thread, I found the following error in dmesg:
    PM-Timer running at invalid rate: 33% of normal - aborting.
I found that interesting because 33% is 1/3 and the clock runs exactly
3x faster than normal...
A bit of search on google gave me several links to posts from other
people with the exact same problem on similar hardware (AMD64 laptop)
but I couldn't find neither the cause nor the fix of that issue (as I
think it might be related to the other issues I observe when the clock
goes too fast)
Does that PM-Timer message makes sense to someone knowledgeable?
Thanks in advance,
Cheers,
Olivier.
