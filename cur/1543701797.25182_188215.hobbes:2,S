I'm using a HPT 404 (374 chipset). I had all those problems and fixed them
by doing
hdparm -m0 /dev/hd?
in every disk connected to the controller. Someone told me it isn't possible
that helped one bit, but the fact is that it did.
I'm no (kernel) developer, though, so other than reality I have no
arguments.
