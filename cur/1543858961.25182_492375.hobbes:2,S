There might be a simpler solution (haven't tried it), just before your
compilation error line:
#undef container_of
#define container_of(...) __container_of(...)
I could add some meaningful macros that eliminate the use of the
non-constant offset to make this more obvious.

It seems that slab_destroy doesn't take the l3 lock again if it is
already held, otherwise it would fail without kmemleak. However, I
can't guarantee that even a minor change wouldn't break kmemleak.

I could also use a simple allocator based on alloc_pages since
kmemleak doesn't track pages. It could be so simple that it would
never need to free any pages, just grow the size as required and reuse
the freed memleak objects from a list.
This would simplify the recursiveness and also work on any other slab
allocator (looking back at the amount of time I spend to sort out the
recursiveness and locking dependencies, I could've implemented a full
allocator).
I'll try to implement your other suggestions as well. Thanks.
