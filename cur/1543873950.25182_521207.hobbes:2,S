Yes.
You should notice that, if you want to send those drivers to kernel
mainstream, they should also be ported to V4L2 API (since V4L1 API is
obsolete). So, you shouldn't include linux/videodev.h, but, instead,
linux/videodev2.h for v4l2 API (and v4l2-dev.h for the internal V4L2
structures). Also, please c/c me on v4l kernel patches submission, since
I'm the V4L maintainer.
Cheers,
Mauro.
