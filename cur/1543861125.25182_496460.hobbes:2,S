Maybe a bit hackish, all we need is to have an empty .direct_IO method
in shmem_aops to make __dentry_open() to pass the O_DIRECT check.  The
following patch adds 40 bytes to kernel text on x86-64.  An even more
hackish but zero cost route is to make .direct_IO variable non-zero via
a cast of -1 or some sort (that is probably ugly as hell).
