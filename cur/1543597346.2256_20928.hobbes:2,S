It might be that F5a is older than F5, as on my filesystem
F5a has date Feb8, while F5 has Mar23 ... But it does not
matter, as both report same broken table, at least for me.
So I have kernel patched with self written IRQ routing table
instead of with BIOS's one, and machine is happy using
IRQ16-19. This implies that I did not coded retrieving
IRQ routing info from ACPI. With current discussions about
moving ACPI to userspace it might be even impossible, as
you for sure want console before you enter userspace,
but you cannot have console if you did not enumerate
devices (video card) yet...
