No, that's not a fair comment. Just as we have added a more efficient
I/O event mechanism than select(2)/poll(2) (the sigio stuff), there is
no reason not to add other mechanisms which are more efficient than
the "standard". They will be open and documented, so everyone is free
to implement them too. And lthreads would designed to have an almost
identical API to pthreads, so a few macros would probably suffice to
port from one to the other.
We shouldn't create new API's for the hell of it, or to bugger our
"competition". But neither can we allow poor standards to tie our
hands.
