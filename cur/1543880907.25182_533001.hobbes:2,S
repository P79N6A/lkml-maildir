Actually I misparsed this function, see below..

That __pci_register_driver code is (presumably with your printk's added..)
        error = driver_register(&drv->driver);
	printk("Error = %d\n", error);
        if (error) {
		printk("Returning %d\n" error);
                return error;
	}
Which doesn't make much sense.  If 'error' is 0, we shouldn't be
taking that second printk & return. What compiler version is this?
btw Greg, wtf does driver_register return a 0 as 'success' if it
completes the function, and 0 as 'failure' if !bus ?
That seems doomed to failure.

So we completed bus_add_driver without failing, then popped back
up to __pci_register_driver and were somehow treated as
if we failed.   *scratches head*
