Sorry, I don't know the ip_queue mechanism and I don't know what could
possibly go wrong.
All we know is that you no longer have kernel panics with the simple
patch I gave you (which just drops packets when a kernel panic would
happen otherwise, and tells about this with a printk). However, you
state there are no entries in your syslog that tell about this dropping.
Is your syslog working right? Do you have a console open on which kernel
messages get printed?
I still secretly suspect the snort code of inserting packets back into
the kernel that don't have an output device (I don't know if that's
possible, though).
cheers,
Bart
