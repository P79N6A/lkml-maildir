Grrr... Ingo, could you read what I said? I'm not talking about problems
coming from lack of knowledge about the kernel. I'm not saying that authors
of drivers are stupid gits (in the cases when they in all probability are
such they are usually anonymous - FUBAR Acme Inc. is all you see). I'm
not saying that 90% of code in drivers is crap.
What I am saying is that in a lot of drivers you can find a code that
is result of plain and simple lack of knowledge about basics of C. And I mean
the basics, not the nontrivial parts.
"Oh, look, I don't know C, here's that project, let's write something and
submit the patch" looks pretty stupid to me.
I'm not talking about bugs. I'm not talking about stupid interfaces.
I'm not talking about typos. I'm not talking about people doing strlen()
on arrays that came from unverified source. I'm talking about the code
that was obviously written by somebody who considers C as voodoo.
The things Linus refered to pale on that background. On the bogosity
scale we have a lot of code that is way higher. Since it manages to
stay unnoticed for years...
And no, I don't think that it's an arrogance. BTW, I don't know who
the authors of these pieces are. I know that problems they had could
be cured by reading any book on C (K&R, Bolsky, whatever) and considering
how long some of that stuff had been in the tree... Well, doesn't speak
highly of the intellect of those who'd written it.
