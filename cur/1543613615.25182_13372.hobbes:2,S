Subject: [PATCH]: reiserfs: B-check_nlink_in_reiserfs_read_inode2.patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello, Linus,
    This patch closes a race between iput() and threads accessing files
    directly by "inode numbers" (i.e., bypassing directory lookup) like
    knfsd.
    Suppose, last reference to file is being unlinked and iput() sleeps
    in sb->s_op->delete_inode(), after removing inode from hash
    table. At this moment "knfsd" comes and looks for this inode. Inode
    is not found in hash table, new instance is created and
    hashed. ->read_inode() is called only to find that on disk inode is
    there, still not deleted by sb->s_op->delete_inode(), so
    ->read_inode() returns successfully. Now, delete_inode() wakes up
    and removes remaining meta-data. At this moment we have valid inode
    in memory without meta-data on disk.
    Reiserfs updates on-disk meta-data including nlink during unlink(),
    so it's enough to check nlink during reiserfs_read_inode2(). This is
    _not_ enough to fix this race for ext2.
Please apply.
Nikita.
