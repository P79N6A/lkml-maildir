Yep. I'd love to have name resolution in the kernel. Right now, I just 
have my mount helper resolve names in userspace and pass them to the
kernel, but that's sort of annoying. Also, it doesn't really help me
with hostnames I receive after mount time.
Sigh.
Then again, including a full resolver in the kernel is probably too
much bloat for too little benefit.
