No, that is not true.
In C/C++ this is true:
NULL == 0
You can _always_ use 0 instead of NULL. The use of NULL is
_only_ for readability reasons. When you assign 0 to a
pointer, the compiler knows that you want to assign a
NULL-pointer and not the value 0.
Even on architectures where the NULL-pointer is not
represented as 0 in memory (another bitmask), it's still
valid to assign 0 to a pointer, because the compiler
_knows_ that you are handling with a pointer and does
The Right Thing (tm).
