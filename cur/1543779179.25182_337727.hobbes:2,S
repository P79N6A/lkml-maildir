Excluding the accessed handling it's ok, for the accessed handling I'm 
doubtful. Could you check if this was introduced recently (for instance by 
the introduction of flush_range_common, which IIRC is recent) or if it's old?
For instance, in latest 2.4, and/or in 2.6.9. If this is a regression the fix 
for accessed handling can be merged too.
