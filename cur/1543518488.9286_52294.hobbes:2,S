But you know at rld time that you used LD_PRELOAD, so you can avoid
the fast path.
Look better at what Linus wants: a prelinked fast path for the usual
case.  What he proposes stays valid if all the cases where the fast
path is inappropriate are either detected (LD_PRELOAD is easily
detectable, since the code which loads the libraries is the one that
handles it) or the lack of detection gives an acceptable result (lack
of override of a weak symbol in a library which has been changed after
the link and for which the symbol did not exist in the previous
version).
