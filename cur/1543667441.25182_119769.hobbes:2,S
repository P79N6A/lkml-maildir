Right ... people seem to have taken more than I meant from this, and taken
it more personally than it was intended. I do believe there is at least
some conflict of interest ... but that doesn't mean people are controlled 
by it.
After some other side conversations, perhaps it would be useful to clarify 
that the appearance of a problem is more that we don't *see* patches getting 
submitted or accepted very often. That doesn't necessarily mean they aren't
getting submitted.
But the divergance of 2.4 is still a massive issue ... whatever the 
underlying causes are.
