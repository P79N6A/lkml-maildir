I just wanted to let people know that as a result of a discussion on 
linux-mm I've added support for the new slab allocator to my collectl 
utility, now making it real easy to dynamically monitor allocations 
along with all the other types of monitoring collectl does.  I've also 
put together a webpage at 
http://collectl.sourceforge.net/SlabInfo.html
 
to give a taste of how this all works as well as to show a few different 
types of output.
