Hi,
if a link from /usr/include/linux to 
/usr/src/where_ever/your/kernel/tree/actually/is/include/linux
is missing, you're in trouble for compiling some userspace apps.
However, the kernel compilation should not depend on it.
But the scripts/split-include does at the moment.H
Attached a patch to fix it.
