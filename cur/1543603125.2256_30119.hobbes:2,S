Does it _only_ hang during coredumping, or also during normal usage?
Could you remove
	down_read(&mmap_sem);
	binfmt->coredump();
	up_read(&mmap_sem);
from fs/exec.c and rerun your tests?
The hang during coredumping is known, there are 2 fixes [I have one, not
yet released, Andrea wrote one, IIRC included in his -aa kernels].
Up to 2.4.10 there was a second hang with /proc/*/stats, that one is
fixed in 2.4.10.
