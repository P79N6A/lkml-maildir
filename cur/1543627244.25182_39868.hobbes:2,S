Good observation, thanks Randy, but wrong fix.

That might be me?  I rewrote that code for 2.4.10
(when you called attention to si_swapinfo slowness).

Not a new fix needing propagation: it was right in 2.5.0.

It was mistakenly changed to this in 2.5.4, when an
additional SWP_BLOCKDEV flag was added (gone in 2.5.6).

Yes, it does.

It is the right fix; but since that condition was misunderstood,
and some other flag might be added in future, the safer patch
would be this more explicit one (which I'll now send to Linus
with a briefer description).
But I hope nobody backports this to 2.4, where it would be
wrong: 2.5.4 confusingly changed the nature of SWP_WRITEOK.
