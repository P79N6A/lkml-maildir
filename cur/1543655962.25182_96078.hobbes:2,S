I know the folks in question :-)  Actually, they'd be nice about it, but 
say something like:
Well, RFC 2988 says that the present value is too small and should be 1s, 
although I take it from other discussion that experiment shows 200ms to be 
OK.
Instead, RFCs 3042 and 3390 present the IETF's preferred approach that has 
actually made it through the process.  But there are lots of drafts in 
progress, so that isn't the final word, although it is certainly better 
than tuning down RTO_MAX.
Now, I have no idea if the kernel presently implements the latter two by 
default (and on a quick look I can't find either in the code).  If not, it 
should.  Shouldn't the initial window be a tunable?

SCTP is in 2.5 now.  Does that not fit the bill?  I admit, I don't know 
about the reliability, although I guess I'm going to find out as I have 
cause to use it shortly.  Wearing an IETF hat, I'd like to hear about this, 
as I'm on a bit of a practicality crusade there :-)
