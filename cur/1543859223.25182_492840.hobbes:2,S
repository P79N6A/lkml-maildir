/proc/timer_stats does timer profiling. You start it via:
	echo 1 > /proc/timer_stats
and then the profile info gathers into /proc/timer_stats. Useful way to 
look at it is:
	sort -n /proc/timer_stats
for example:

1755 total events, 585.534 events/sec
this shows us that the kondemand kernel threads are causing 90% of the 
timeout events on this system.
/proc/timer_list shows all currently pending timers, and all the state 
of the hardware timers. That is a bit different from timer_stat but 
still very useful: it gives us a snapshot into the current state of the 
(hr)timer subsystem. I needed it to debug a couple of high-res timers 
subsystem bugs. The SysRq trigger was useful for things like timer 
related boot hangs. (It's also useful to catch excessive waiters during 
bootup.)
