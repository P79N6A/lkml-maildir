I just realized that I forgot to mention, the latest kernel I tried on
with 2.6.9-rc1-bk15, which was still broken, network doesn't work. 
However, the autoneg failed messages in dmesg were gone.  I tried
multiple reboots to see if it would work/not work at random and I never
saw it work even once.
Thanks,
Paul Larson
