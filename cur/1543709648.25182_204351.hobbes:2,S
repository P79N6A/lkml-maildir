Thanks.  Unfortunately, it isn't my code that's using so much stack 
space--it's the ACPI "driver".  It has many deep nested calls, and 
I believe each call in x86_64 is taking more stack space than it would
 in i386 because of the larger registers.  But, what I really wanted
 to do is increase the kernel size to verify that the problem is a 
stack overflow (my other tests have led me to believe so).  I wasn't 
going to propose that as a solution.
Thanks!
