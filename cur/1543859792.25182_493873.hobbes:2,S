I've completed one installation with Linus' patch plus the two from
Andrew successfully, but I'm currently trying again... but I really
need a better testcase since an installation takes about an hour.
Andrei, which torrent do you download as a testcase?  It would be good
if someone could suggest a torrent which is legal and not too large.
