It doesn't work.
I wrote the code and asked people to test it.
So many BIOS quirks.
(Numbering of drives depends on setup options, and on whether
there are SCSI disks mentioned in the BIOS setup,
there are off-by-one errors in several BIOSes,
several versions of Phoenix extensions are implemented etc.
It is really not worth trying to go this way. It fails.)
No, geometry does not exist, and also BIOS drivers have come
to the same conclusion.
Since nothing depends on it, there is no reason to want
any geometry in particular.
