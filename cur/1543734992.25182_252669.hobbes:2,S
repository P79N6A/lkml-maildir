At MontaVista I have been working on a thing we call VST which looks ahead in 
the timer list and, finding nothing for N ticks, turns off the ticker until that 
time.  It is not tickless, unless the system is idle, but then it can go 
tickless for as long as the max value that can be programmed on the wakeup 
timer.  Interrupts prior to that time will, of course, also wake the system.
Seems like the best of both worlds to me.
An early version of this is on the HRT sourceforge site.
