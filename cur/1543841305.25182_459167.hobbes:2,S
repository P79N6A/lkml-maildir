c'mon, it must be taped to 1,000 monitors and bathroom doors by now?

I guess so, thanks.  Pointing at the README was sneaky.

This ABI/ thing rather snuck under my radar (I saw it go past, but a lot of
things go past).
It'll be good if it works, but it is going to take quite a lot of thought,
effort and maintainer vigilance to be successful and to avoid becoming
rotware.
I wonder how hard it would be to write a script which parses a diff, works
out if it touches ABI things, complain if it doesn't alter
Documentation/ABI/*?  Not very - it's just a matter of defining a suitable
regexp.
What _should_ be documented in there, anyway?
- syscalls, obviously.
- /proc?  If so, everything, or are there exceptions?
- /sys?  If so, everything, or are there exceptions?
- ioctl numbers and payloads?
- netlink messages?
- ethtool thingies?  netdev interface names?  /proc/iomem identifiers? 
  module names?  kernel-thread comm[] contents?  The ABI is pretty fat.
scary.
