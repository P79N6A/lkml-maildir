Umm ... "miscompilation"?  As in the compiler produced the wrong code
based on the input provided?
  int * p;
  ...
  a = *p;
        movl p,%eax
        movl (%eax),%edx
The assembly code appears to load the address stored at p (keep in mind
that p is a pointer), then use that address to fetch the value which is
placed in a.  What do you believe should have been generated by the compiler?
