Hi Randy,
Thank you very much for your answer.  I will make the corrections and
come back with an updated version of my code.

The "volatile" is needed for type consistency.  For the memory
barriers, I was not sure and I preferred to take a safe bet.  I will
try to investigate them further.  Any help or pointer to documentation
would be appreciated.  I have already read the documentation
distributed with the Linux source code, and the "Linux Device Drivers"
book by J. Corbet, A. Rubini, and G. Kroah-Hartman.

Ok, I will remove some "inline", and only keep them for the smaller
functions.

The "volatile" is here because mace->perif.ctrl.parport.context_a and
context_b are from type "volatile u64".

Ok.  Those are mostly functions whose parameters are dictated by an
external API.  I didn't want to duplicate their documentation.

They are not inline because their only use is via pointers in struct
parport_operations.

Ok.

Ok.

Yes it is.  Its contents is copied in the parport_ip32_probe_port()
initialization function (see below).

Here is the only use of parport_ip32_ops.

Ok.
