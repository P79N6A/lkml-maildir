The latter is the more serious of the two. I'll go about investigating
that as the primary task here. Testing and a more verbose patch
description are clearly very little work.
General maintenance-relevant commentary: This patch arose from an
observation of a lacuna in the API. There are no bugs or apps broken
awaiting this as a fix, so it's not needed by 2.6.22 or otherwise
urgently. My use for it is report generation in VM (and possibly other)
testcases. The ack-in-concept is good enough for me to go about
sweeping up the OS/standards compatibility, testing, and documentation
issues in the near future prior to resubmission.
