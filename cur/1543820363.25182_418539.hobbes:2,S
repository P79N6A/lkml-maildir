This patch sets my nerves a-jangling.
What are the units of soonness?  It's awfully waffly.  Can we specify this
more tightly?
Neither rcu_pending() nor rcu_soon_pending() are commented or documented. 
Pity the poor user trying to work out what they do, and how they differ. 
They're global symbols and they form part of the RCU API - they should be
kernel docified, please.
There's probably a reason why neither of these symbols are exported to
modules.  Once they're actually documented I mught be able to work out what
that reason is ;)
