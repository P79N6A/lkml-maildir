I can see why Linus isn't too excited about this patch:
o Increased entropy pool sizes are independent.  Should be a seperate
  patch.
o Huge numbers of #ifdef's in the code are Plain Wrong(tm).
o Replacing current randomization functions with new ones without
  lengthy explanation doesn't make me happy.
Also, if the patch was inline instead of an attachment, I could easily
quote it while commenting.
Not sure whether there are useful things in the patch, but in the
current form I wouldn't want to take it.  And usually I'm less picky
than Linus.
