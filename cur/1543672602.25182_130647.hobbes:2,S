Well, for a system wide system call hook, a kernel mechanism is necessary 
(and useful too IMHO). However for our usage (MPI) it is enough to know 
when the current process calls either sbrk(-n) or munmap glibc functions, 
thus it is sufficient to implement some kind of callback functionality for 
certain glibc functions, sort of like the malloc/free hooks but on a more 
general basis since some applications doesn't use malloc/free but 
implement their own alloc/free algorithms using the syscalls (one example 
is f90 apps).
Ideas anyone ?
