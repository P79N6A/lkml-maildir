Subject: [patch 2.6.28-rc4 2/3] regulator: sysfs attribute reduction (v2)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/11/11/513

From: David Brownell <dbrownell@users.sourceforge.net>
Clean up the sysfs interface to regulators by only exposing the
attributes that can be properly displayed.  For example: when a
particular regulator method is needed to display the value, only
create that attribute when that method exists.
This cleaned-up interface is much more comprehensible.  Most
regulators only support a subset of the possible methods, so
often more than half the attributes would be meaningless.  Many
"not defined" values are no longer necessary.  (But handling
of out-of-range values still looks a bit iffy.)
Documentation is updated to reflect that few of the attributes
are *always* present, and to briefly explain why a regulator may
not have a given attribute.
This adds object code, about a dozen bytes more than was removed
by the preceding patch, but saves a bunch of per-regulator data
associated with the now-removed attributes.  So there's a net
reduction in memory footprint.

Difference from V1: update the sysfs ABI/testing docs to match.
