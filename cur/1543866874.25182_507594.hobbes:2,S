OK, I see there are features to make life easier when I decide to use
suspend. But it looks like that using suspend is the goal and dealing
with the constraints is a lot of work and I'm still far from being
convinced that it would provide me advantage.

Unless I'm mistaken, I have to type the passphrase twice then :
  - once at suspend
  - once at resume
which is once more per "boot" than what I'm doing on loop-aes.

I'm not much convinced by the advantage of reading 500 MB on disk to have
emacs in hot cache :-)

You're certainly right. I really think that this feature is clearly not for
me but it's more featureful than I initially thought, and I could encourage
some people to give it a try.
