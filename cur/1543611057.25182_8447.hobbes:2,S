Well, it didn't break anything, but it didn't fix my no-sound after suspend 
problem.
Without your patch, sound on my dell inspiron 3500 laptop works fine until 
the first APM suspend and resume cycle, after which noatun under KDE will 
block indefinitely trying to write sound and trying sound from the command 
line (no X/KDE running) can get a little sound out sometimes, but it loops 
endlessly with warnings printing to the console about an IRQ problem.  To get 
sound working again, I have to power the laptop off and back on.
I just applied the patch against 2.5.0 (with the 
don't-eat-your-filesystem-on-shutdown patch as well: hey, it's 2.5, it's 
supposed to do that, isn't it?) and it made no noticeable difference.
lspci produces the same output before and after APM suspend.  It's a strange 
chipset, but it's using the ad1848 sound driver:
lspci -s 01:00.1 -v -v

Any clues?
