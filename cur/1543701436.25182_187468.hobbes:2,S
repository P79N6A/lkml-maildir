Well, the point was it _didn't_ work on AMD64 with 2.6.0 at all.
Which was what I was trying to fix.  Also, it is a megaraid2 series
driver in the 2.6.0 kernel (2.00.3), I've since ported the 2.00.9
2.4 driver to 2.6.0, but have not yet had it tested (I did not
make the 64bit changes I had posted a patch for).
I guess we'll see, I hope bumping to 2.00.9 works.
