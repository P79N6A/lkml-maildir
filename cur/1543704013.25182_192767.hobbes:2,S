I'd like some input on a bug that was recently reported to Gentoo's bugzilla.
http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=38886
I personally don't know whether the behavior they are seeing is really a bug 
or not. All my systems show similar behavior, but the bug says that it is 
different than what happened prior to 2.4.22.
For some background gentoo-sources is based off of the -ck patchset, and aside 
from the stuff in the -ck patches, it doesn't touch anything in fs/reiser.
If anyone has any input I'd appreciate it. If you need more info, I can get it 
for you.
