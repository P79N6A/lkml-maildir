Hi,
Changes in this release:
- Don't merge requests with ->special set. Not a highmem introduced bug.
  (discovered by Mark Hemment)
- __scsi_end_request didn't decrement hard_nr_sectors correctly. Not a
  highmem introduced bug. (discovered by Mark Hemment)
- Modular IDE/SCSI needs kmap_prot and kmap_pte exported (discovered by
  Arjan van de Ven)
- Add qlogicfc as highmem capable. Hopefully a merge of the newer
  version will carry this flag forward. (tested by Mark Hemment)
That means there is a new block-highmem-3 and scsi-high-3, the rest
remains the same. Get it all in block-highmem-all-4 if you want.
For 2.4.5:

or for 2.4.5-ac4 (just one big patch, sorry)
