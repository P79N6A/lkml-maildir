Yes, I've seen problems in the past with workloads that use sched_yield 
heavily.
But bear in mind, the ~2700 sched_yields shown in the schedstats 
occurred over a 9 minute period. 
That means that sched_yield is being called at a rate of around 5 per 
second -- this is not a heavy user of sched_yield.
To put this into a broader perspective, this workload has around 270 
tasks, and the context switch rate is around
45,000 per second.
