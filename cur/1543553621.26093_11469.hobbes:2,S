Hi!
I played with machine with .5GB ram, and was able to spawn 16000
'sleep forever' processes (compiled statically):
void main(void)
{
	close(0); close(1); close(2); pause();
}
I belive that on 2GB machine, I'd be able to hit 32K processes
limit. 1GB machine _could_ hit it too (someone try that).
Strange thing is that machine does not even try to use swap, but
userland stops working at the end.
