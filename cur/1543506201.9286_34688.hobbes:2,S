CNET DOWNLOAD DISPATCH (Mac Edition)
http://www.download.com/?dd.dl.m.0817.00
August 17, 1999
Vol. 4, No. 33
_______________________________________________________________________
This past weekend, while on a road trip in southern California, I came to
a rather startling realization: I love Los Angeles. Sure, having an
affinity for a city is nothing unnatural, but check the facts:
I'm not a film buff. I hate smog. Seven-lane freeways scare me.
All the same, I can't help but marvel at the phenomenon known as L.A.:
it's just so darn big. With more than 20 million people in the greater
Los Angeles area, it's inevitable that this metropolis will have
something to offer you. Heck, sometimes quantity and quality are
directly proportional.
Hence, this week we're hitting you with quantity and quality, too. From
the brand-new BBEdit Lite update to Audion, the newest MP3 player on
the block, we're set to give you a monster-sized fresh crop of downloads.
Try Audion:

Pick up the new and improved BBEdit Lite:
http://www.download.com/DD/dl/0,302,0-0817-2-002,00.html
And that's just for starters--read on for Anarchie,
Kaleidoscope, Flash 4, and more.

in the theater. This week our caped crusader scouted out screensavers for

7. The Emailbag
>The most recent Dispatch for Mac downloads indicated Mpecker Encoder is
>one of the top 10 downloads.  Since all I have is the beta version, I
>was anxious to download the latest. Can't find it. It is not listed in
>50 most popular downloads and then when I search your database, I get
>nothing at all. An error somewhere? Dan
CNET Download.com responds:
Hello, Dan. We regret to inform you that MPecker Encoder is no longer
offering free public betas for download. The most recent beta build (b25)
expired at the beginning of August, and Rafael Luebbert, the developer of
MPecker Encoder, has decided to halt public distribution of the program.
Hence, no more free download on our site.
For more information, you can check MPecker's homepage at:
http://www.download.com/DD/dl/0,302,0-0817-2-032,00.html
Sadly, there are no other Mac freeware MP3 encoders on the market, but
Xingtech's AudioCatalyst and Casady & Greene's SoundJam MP are two
affordable commercial programs that can easily encode your files into
MP3s.
For a free trial version of SoundJam MP, click here:

For more information about AudioCatalyst for the Mac, click here:

Hope this helps, Dan, and thanks for writing!

*And you thought "The Blair Witch Project" was creepy: on this day in
1590, John White, governor of the Roanoke Island colony, returned from
  a supply trip to find that every single colonist had mysteriously
       disappeared without a trace. They were never found.*
