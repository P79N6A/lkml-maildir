It seems that Alan does not like to miss a single day to degrade his 
credibiltiy :-(
A fact based discussion looks different...
-	What is a "large computer"?
-	What is an "extremely narrow market segment"?
	What is the evidence of this statement compared to Linux?
-	What are the minimum requirements for a machine to run Linux?
-	What are the minimum requirements for a machine to run Solaris?
People who cannot answer these questions should not try to start mad
speculations on derived conclusions.
The size of the loadable dtrace module is ~ 100 kB, this is nothing bad even 
for small appliances these days.
Guess what Brian Cantrill is running on his notebook?
Guess what machine Brian is using to run dtrace demos on shows?
And hey, Brian is even able to make a 4 hour demo within a single hour on this 
machine ;-)
Dtrace is a powerful idea that gives unbelievable new opportinities to 
developers, sysadmins and users.
