That's not at all clear.  I'll go farther: I think it is unlikely
to be true.
If you want to think about cryptographic primitives being arbitrarily
broken, I think there will be scenarios where /dev/random is insecure.
As for what you mean by "good uniform hash", I think you'll need to
be a bit more precise.

Yes, I've read Shannon's original paper on the subject, as well
as many other treatments.
I stand by my comments above.
