There are several different patches to ide-scsi in Linus's
snapshots that will most likely appear in lk 2.5.55 .
See:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.5/snapshots/
with patch-2.5.54-bk6 being the most recent. See the associated
log for a listing of the ide-scsi changes.
It would be interesting to hear if that snapshot fixes your
ide-scsi problem.
