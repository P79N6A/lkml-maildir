Good news! I read the mfgpt patch for 2.6.22 and saw what the workaround
consisted in (writing 0xff at MSR 0x5140002B). So I tried adding the
following on top of 2.6.24-rc8 :
static int __init mfgpt_fix(char *s)
{
	u32 val, dummy;
        /* The following udocumented bit resets the MFGPT timers */
        val = 0xFF;
        wrmsr(0x5140002B, val, dummy);
	return 1;
}
__setup("mfgptfix", mfgpt_fix);
and booted with the newly added option (mfgptfix). It worked like a charm :

So it seems like applying the workaround on top of TinyBIOS 0.98 undoes
this BIOS's workaround. I'm now wondering how we could detect whether
the workaround was applied or not :-/
Next, I retried with MFGPT_TIMER=y + latest fix you posted moving the
initialization race, and here's what I get now :

Interestingly, during the boot, I got thousands of the following line :
geode_mfgpt: reading 0x6200 + 0x6 + (0x0 * 8) = 0x6206                          
It's a debug line I added in geode_mfgpt_read() which writes the timer and
reg being read. It slowed the boot down due to being written to a serial
console, but fortunately stopped when syslogd had changed the console log
level. Just checking...
# grep mfgpt /proc/interrupts;sleep 10;grep mfgpt /proc/interrupts
  7:      82320    XT-PIC-XT        mfgpt-timer
  7:      84882    XT-PIC-XT        mfgpt-timer
It delivers 256 IRQs/s. That makes me think about this comment in mfgpt_32.c :
 * We are using the 32Khz input clock - its the only one that has the
 * ranges we find desirable.  The following table lists the suitable
 * divisors and the associated hz, minimum interval
 * and the maximum interval:
 *
 *  Divisor   Hz      Min Delta (S) Max Delta (S)
 *   1        32000     .0005          2.048
 *   2        16000      .001          4.096
 *   4         8000      .002          8.192
...
When you say a 32kHz clock, you mean 32000 Hz. Are you really sure ? Most
32 kHz clocks everywhere are really 32768 Hz (the watch quartz). BTW, I'm
seeing a 32.768 kHz xtal close to the CS5536, and the numbers above seem
to support this suggestion too.
So right now that I've found what caused old kernel to unexpectedly work,
I'm planning a BIOS upgrade. I'm still just wondering what we can do to
detect that the workaround should be needed. I suspect nothing, of course,
but just in case... Maybe we can detect the effects of the workaround ?
Best regards,
Willy
