I hope to get a chance to look at this today.  Thus far, I know that 
the PIT version does not keep good time in the face of timers of 
resolution > 1/HZ, i.e. the "_HR" clocks.
This has to do with the fact that we have only one interrupt source 
and must change it to get the sub jiffies interrupts.  In the process 
we loose track of where the jiffies interrupt should be.  There is an 
attempt to use the second PIT timer to cover for this, but assumptions 
are made here that may not be right. (This timer is used for memory 
refresh and is set up by the BIOS.  We can not change it and we assume 
that it has a given period.  I suppose we could attempt to measure the 
period, but thus far we have assumed that these sorts of machines 
would not require high res timers and have not tried to run down these 
issues.
A side issue is that the timers seem to not follow the spec (at least 
on my test machine) in the regard that a status bit is supposed to 
indicate when the latch has been loaded after a program has been 
output.  I can easily find cases where a wait for the bit to change is 
followed by a read of the latch which returns a stale value.  I 
suppose some of this has to do with a large difference between the cpu 
clock and the timer clock.
