Yes, don't risk the backups. If you don't want to change the kernel, you 
can load the st module with the option try_direct_io=0. If you do this, st 
will use the driver's buffer for reading and writing and you don't see 
this problem.
If you later have an opportunity to try the patch Linus suggested, it 
might provide interesting information. However, if all goes well, the st 
driver will not be using these mapping functions in 2.6.16 any more (see 
Mike Christie's changes in "[GIT PATCH] SCSI update for 2.6.15" sent to 
linux-scsi by James Bottomley yesterday). I am not sure this fixes your 
problem but it certainly changes the code that is being debugged.
