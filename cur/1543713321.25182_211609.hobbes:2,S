This single patch which enables the compound page logic in
get_page()/put_page():

Increases a 3.5MB vmlinux by 15kB, a lot of it fastpath.  We should retain
this optimisation.
It might be better to switch over to address masking in get_user_pages()
and just dump all the compound page logic.  I don't immediately see how the
get_user_pages() caller can subsequently do put_page() against the correct
pageframe, but I assume you worked that out?
