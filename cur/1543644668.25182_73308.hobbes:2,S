Do note that the instructions for the benchmark suggest you boot single
user, which cuts down one problem, and since Con adopted my suggestion to
allow the user to set the location of the test file, I put the big file in
a filesystem which is formatted just before the test (I knew I'd find a
use for all that disk ;-) so that stays pretty constant.
The problem of memory size on the halfmem io is more serious, on a large
system the writes are all in memory, on a small system they cause
thrashing. I run in 256m for all tests just for this reason.
Not disagreeing with what you said, but the test is not inherently subject
to much jitter given care in running it.
