I think having a revision field in pci_dev that's initialized by the pci
code early on would be immensivly useful.  For now it probably makes sense
to do in ahci what all other drivers do and read it on it's own.
Adding it to the pci core and switching all the drivers over would
be a separate project.  Maybe we can sign AMD up for it as a general
kernel contribution thing? :)
