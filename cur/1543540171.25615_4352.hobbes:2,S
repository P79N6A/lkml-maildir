PLEASE save the mail.
But even more, please READ the mail too. Look at my suggestion. And when
you send the mail out to somebody who complains about NRGROUPS, then send
out the mail in ENTIRETY, and explain to those people why you continually
ignore my suggestions even though they obviously fix the problem.
I'm damn sick and tired of you blaming the kernel for your own stupidity
and incompetence.
