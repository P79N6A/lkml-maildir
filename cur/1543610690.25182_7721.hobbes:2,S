Hi all,
Does anybody know where can I find the STANDARD kernel aliases that
are send by kernel to modprobe, when the kernel can't find properly
piece of code himself?
For example I need the ospm_system alias, because I would like
to clean unused modules via crontab, but kmod wouldn't load some
modules himself.
Thx.
