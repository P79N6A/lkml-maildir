I think we are misunderstanding each other here. I just want to see some
kind of locking like DRI for input if "direct input" would ever be
implemented. I would like to see also a standard api used for all the
keyboards and mice. This is why I'm a a fan of the input api. Lets face
it. The XFree86 developement cycle is many many many times longer than
linux. This way as soon as a driver using the standard input api is
avaliable for linux it is supported under XFree86.
