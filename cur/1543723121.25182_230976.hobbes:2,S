I've seen different audio players react very differently in the same 
situations with the same kernel.  Are people testing alternatives to 
make sure it's not just the program being bad?  Maybe the people doing 
these scheduler tests are using all the popular media players and 
different widely available gui systems to make sure they're not tuning 
the kernel for a specific program.   That should probably be clarified. 
I think it ought to be made clear that the gain is being made for a type 
of program, and not a single one, a type of workload and not a workload 
consisting of this and that and this program.  That can include 
different windowing systems (xfree86 vs non-free X implimentations or 
DirectFB) and gtk vs qt vs no toolkit..  This way obvious userspace bugs 
can be exposed and all this tuning wont be done for helping keep bugs 
and bad implimentations in use.
