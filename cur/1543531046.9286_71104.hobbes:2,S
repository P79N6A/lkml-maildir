Someone mentioned how hard it was to write "memory safe" apps for
embedded
devices, considering how the stack is dynamically allocated.  I pointed
out
that this isn't that hard. 
Having enough RAM is fine for a pc.  An embedded device running linux
will likely
be mass-produced with the minimum amount of RAM though.
