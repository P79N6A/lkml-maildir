On a somewhat related note ...
We (Big Blue) have a performance reporting application that
would like to know how long a task sits on a runqueue before
it is actually given the CPU.  In other words, it wants to
know how long the 'runnable task' was delayed due to contention
for the CPU(s).  Of course, one could get an overall feel for
this based on total runqueue length.  However, this app would
really like this info on a per-task basis.
Does anyone else think this type of info would be useful?
A patch to compute/export this info should be straight forward
to implement.
