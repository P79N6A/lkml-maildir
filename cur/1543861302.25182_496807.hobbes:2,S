With git-block.patch applied, my system locks up *hard* at system shutdown
time - even alt-sysrq doesn't do anything.  Need to do the "power button for 5"
stunt to get the system back.
The system is Fedora Core 6/Rawhide, and the last command issued (from
/etc/rc6.d/S01reboot) is "/sbin/cryptsetup remove swap".  It hits that,
and *wham* we're dead.  Works fine if I revert git-block.patch.
The line from /etc/crypttab for the encrypted swap:
swap /dev/mapper/VolGroup00-swap /dev/urandom swap,cipher=aes-cbc-essiv:sha256
This ring any bells?  I haven't gotten ambitious enough yet to look for
individual commits inside the git-block.patch (this is just one of 3 issues
I've having to bisect in -mm this time around...)
