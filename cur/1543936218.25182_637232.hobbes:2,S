Right. As you've noticed, that pin is not a reliable way of detecting cards. It works badly, if all, for MMC cards. And some SD cards also lack the necessary pull-up.
But for the matter at hand, some cards might rely on the pull-up being there, so you'll get bit-errors without it. I don't have time to double check the specs right now, but it might explain why you're seeing problems with MMC and not SD.
Btw, the MMC core sends you ios information on how you should fiddle with that bit. It was needed on a Winbond controller (the wbsd driver) as some models relied on it for card detection.
