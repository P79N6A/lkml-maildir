Subject: 2.6.25-rc1-ext4-1 patchset released
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

This is a new ext4 patchset which is synchronized with the 2.6.25-rc1
release.  No new patches were added, just patches removed because they
have been accepted upstream.
At this point, I do not anticipate any more patches to ext4 that will
change the on-disk format.  The focus is on the optimization patches
(i.e., delayed allocation support) fine-tuning performance, and fixing
any bugs which turn up as more people use ext4.
