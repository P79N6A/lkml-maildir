But why would you "feel" safer?  And why should the Linux kernel care
about how people "feel"?  The purpose of these mechanisms is not to make
people feel safer; it is to make them actually be safer.  If it isn't
actually making people safer -- if it is just to provide "warm fuzzies"
and a perception of safety -- then I don't see what business it has
going into the Linux kernel.  What threat, exactly, are you trying to
defend against?  What's your threat model?
