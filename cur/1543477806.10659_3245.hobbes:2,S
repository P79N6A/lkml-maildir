eth0: 3Com 3c905B Cyclone 100baseTx at 0xf880,  00:10:4b:d2:5e:49, IRQ 10
  8K byte-wide RAM 5:3 Rx:Tx split, autoselect/Autonegotiate interface.
  MII transceiver found at address 24, status 786d.
  MII transceiver found at address 0, status 786d.
  Enabling bus-master transmits and whole-frame receives.
