I don't know much about Kernel Panics. I hope that someone that knows could
take a look, but so far, it looks like you need to be running Sid to have
this working propperly.
Please try 2.6.8, I'm almost sure that it should work.
And anyway, this ML is not really a user support list, try asking in a
debian mailing list, if they think that it's something wrong with the
kernel, then come back and let us know.
