The e1000 driver has some more knobs you can turn. I have this
in my /etc/modules file:
e1000 RxAbsIntDelay=256,256 TxAbsIntDelay=256,256 TxDescriptors=1024,1024 RxDescriptors=1024,1024
(this is for two cards)
and this in /etc/sysctl.conf:
# Tune back swappiness on 2.6
vm.swappiness = 10
# Lots of kernel memory needed for e1000
vm.min_free_kbytes = 65535
This box accepts ~250 mbit/sec, stores that on disk, and streams it
out again to multiple peers at ~1300 mbit/sec total. Kernel 2.6.14.2,
dual xeon em64t in 64 bits mode, 4 GB memory.
Mike.
