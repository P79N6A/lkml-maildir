It's interesting that your results seem to show an improvement in
performance, while mine show a consistent drop.  My tests were not very
scientific, and I was running much higher dbench processes, 'dbench 64' or
'dbench 128', and at those levels performance with lowlatency enabled fell
though the floor on my setup.
My system is a PIII 700Mhz, Adaptec 7892 Ultra-160, software RAID1,
reiserfs, 256MB RAM.
Under lower loads, like the 'dbench 12' lowlatency only showed only a few
percent loss, but once you approached the levels around 50 things really
went downhill.
I might try to do a more complete test, maybe there's something else in my
config that would make this be a problem, but it was definately quite
noticable.
Later,
Tom
