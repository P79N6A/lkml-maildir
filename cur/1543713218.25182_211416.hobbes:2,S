It's causing problems today by preventing people from being able to
de-select SCSI for no obvious reason.
It is far less intuitive to know you have to turn off USB_STORAGE
before you can turn off SCSI than to know that you have to turn on
SCSI before you can turn on USB_STORAGE.
If you wish to keep it this way, could we either have:
(a) a note in the SCSI help text to say that the option is forced
    on by USB_STORAGE, so people know what to turn off.
or
(b) have kconfig tell you why you can't turn off the option.
Silently preventing options being turned off with no obvious reason
is a pretty major misfeature.
