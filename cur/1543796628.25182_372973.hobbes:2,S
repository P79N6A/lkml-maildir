We're not writing an entire stack.  We're writing a layer that sits in 
between the current ieee80211 stack that's already present in the kernel 
and drivers that do not have a hardware MAC.  Since ieee80211 is already 
in use in the kernel today, this seemed like a natural and useful 
extension to the existing code.  I agree that it's somewhat wasteful to 
keep rewriting 802.11 stacks and we considered other options, but it 
seemed like a more logical choice to work with what was available and 
recommended than to use an external stack.
