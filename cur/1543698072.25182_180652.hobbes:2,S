I've seen this same issue with my Quantum DLT4000 & 2940UW as well. It
seems to have to do with there being a tape in the drive when the
aic7xxx driver initializes. It looks to me like the DLT4000 does not
respond to the DV configuration attempt when it is in the middle of
rewinding a tape. If the rewind takes long enough, aic7xxx times out the
configuration and gives the message you saw. 
I run a completely static kernel so in my case the problem happens when
I reboot the machine with a tape still in the drive and the tape is
positioned near the end. When the 2940UW BIOS initializes it triggers
the DLT4000 to start rewinding the tape and if the tape is positioned
far enough along it can still be rewinding when the kernel boots and 
aic7xxx tries to perform the DV configuration.
