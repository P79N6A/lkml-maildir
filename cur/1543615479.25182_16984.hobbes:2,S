<shrug> kernel build doesn't have to use it - if I mount a writable layer
atop of the clean tree and build in the resulting tree, build system
doesn't need to have any idea of that fact.  That's the point - you are
emulating the thing that is generally useful and belongs to different
layer - namely, the kernel.
