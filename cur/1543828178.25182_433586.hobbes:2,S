OK I can see what you're trying to achieve, but I don't know that it is
worthwhile. Userspace is doing something wrong, and it isn't normally the
kernel's job to detect that.
When something like this comes up, sticking to the simplest semantics is
often best.
That said, it isn't a great deal of code to maintain, and not "incorrect"
as such. So if you convince Ingo to pick it up, I wouldn't complain.
