Hi
sometimes user space program hangs forever.
In old days i remeber there was unkillable dosemu.
May be there are good how to. Some one can point to it?
This is problem/solution isn't related to current kernel. This
is question: what to do in this sitaution. 
Now i have eject(1)
 $ ps uax | grep eject
 root     12662  0.0  0.0   1528   560 ?        D    Jul31   0:00 eject
 root     12866  0.0  0.0   1532   560 pts/10   D    Jul31   0:00 eject

That same eject worked on that same hardware and kernel before.
 # strace -p 12662
 Process 12662 attached - interrupt to quit
dosn't show which syscall is called.
kill -9 12662 doesn't help to.
No ops, no other info in dmesg.
How to find problem? How to kill/stop proces without reboot?
How to find which lock is taken by kernel to complete user space
request/syscalls? 
kernel: 2.6.17-gentoo-r4-20061014-00
dmesg: 
http://89.190.108.145/~rokas/dmesg.txt
config: 
http://89.190.108.145/~rokas/config.txt
Thanks for any hints.
