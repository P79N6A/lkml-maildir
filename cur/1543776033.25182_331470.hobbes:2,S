Hm, I did not get any answer to my last report last week. Didn't you get it?
There are still the same errors in kernel 2.6.13rc2 as in 2.6.13rc1. So
I've attached an up to date syslog and the last error report below.
Copying files from the iteraid is possible now for a few seconds. I just
get the message:
warning: many lost ticks.
Your time source seems to be instable or some driver is hogging interupts
rip __do_softirq+0x50/0xe8
But after some time copying files from dvd (iteraid) the kernel hangs
and repeats the following messages:
Jul  6 11:29:39 orclex kernel: hde: media error (bad sector):
status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }

Ok, here is the last report:

arg...with -mm2 sda3 is sdb3. Using an other kernel rootfs is still sda3
and I have to change /etc/fstab each time for each test.
Kernel 2.6.13rc1 makes it better and does not move my rootfs but it is
still not working. I can see all ide devices (hda and hdb on ICH6 and
hde instead of sda on ITE8212) but I can't read or copy any file.
Accessing a file on dvdrom (on ITE8212) it get following error
in syslog:
hde: media error (bad sector): status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hde: media error (bad sector): error=0x30 { LastFailedSense=0x03 }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
end_request: I/O error, dev hde, sector 1305136
Buffer I/O error on device hde, logical block 326284
Mounting hdb (cdrom) I get the "drive appears confused" error message
and linux hangs.
Mounting hda (disk, fat32) I takes a long time to copy a small file.
Also every minute I get the error "irq 201: nobody cared".
Syslog with kernel parameters pci=routeirq and apic=debug is attached.

When I disable idedisk, idecd and ide-generic I don't get any of the
errors but I also do not have any ide device (hda, hdb, hde) in /dev.

I don't know how to do that.
