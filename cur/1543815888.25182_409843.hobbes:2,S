Hrm, I was actually thinking that each of the VMI calls would be an 
export (vmi_init, vmi_set_pxe, etc.).  I know that you want the 
hypervisor to drive the inlining but I that's sufficiently hairy (not to 
mention, there's not AFAIK performance data yet to justify it) that I 
think it ought to be left for VMI 2.0.

Multi-licensing is fine as long as one is GPL :-)
