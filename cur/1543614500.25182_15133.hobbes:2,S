Alternatively, deal with this problem the same way the "This may also be
built as a module..." comment is - either include it several thousand
times in Configure.help or (better still) have the configuration tools
spit it out automatically every time the need for it crops up. The
following ruleset could easily be implemented even in the `make config`
and `make menuconfig` parsers, and should be just as easy in CML2.
Applying rule (1) will result in a considerable reduction in the size of
the file Documentation/Configure.help as it currently stands.
Comments, anybody?
Best wishes from Riley.

RULE 1: If a particular symbol is defined using a command that
	allows it to be selected as "Modular", then tack the
	following to the end of the help description for that
	symbol when a user requests help:
		This driver is also available as a module( = code
		which can be inserted in and removed from the
		running kernel whenever you want). If you want to
		compile it as a module, say M here and read
		Documentation/modules.txt in the kernel source.
RULE 2: If the help text for a particular symbol includes a word
	matching either of the egrep patterns '[KkMmGgTt][Bb]' or
	'[KkMmGgTt]i[Bb]' then tack the following to the end of
	the help description for that symbol when a user requests
	help:
		Differing standards are used for the numeric
		designators in the computing and engineering
		worlds. For the purposes of this document, the
		following designators are used with the stated
		values:
			Symbol	Designation	  Number of Bytes
			~~~~~~	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			KiB	Decimal Kilobyte  1,000
			KB	Binary Kilobyte   1,024
			MiB	Decimal Megabyte  1,000,000
			MB	Binary Megabyte   1,048,576
			GiB	Decimal Gigabyte  1,000,000,000
			GB	Binary Gigabyte   1,073,741,824
			TiB	Decimal Terabyte  1,000,000,000,000
			TB	Binary Terabyte   1,099,511,627,776
		This difference has arisen as a direct consequence of
		the fact that computers naturally talk in a binary
		(base 2) number system rather than the decimal (base
		10) system preferred by mere mortals.
RULE 3: If more than one of the above rules apply, all configuration
	systems shall agree on a common order in which to apply them.
