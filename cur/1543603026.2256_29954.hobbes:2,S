At this point, it looks like I'm going to get a partial picture.tif in test
after recovery...

Now, it looks like I'll end up with "a" in test...  
>From what you're describing, it looks like the contents of test after a
truncate won't be overwritten by another transaction until the deletion of
those blocks has made it to disk...  So, while in ordered, or journal mode,
I'd end up with "a" in test, but with writeback mode there is no such
guarantee.
Am I missing something?
Are there any known cases where ext3 will not be able to recover pervious
data when a write wasn't able to complete?
