Currently we are doing an identity do_mmap_pgoff() over the region to 
flush page tables currently. It works very nice with 2.6.x kernels. 
Unfortunately 2.4.x do not merge regions this mmap split back together :-( 
Fortunately we can just remap whole original region to merge VMAs back 
together when we think that there is too many VMAs around.

Probably not, we are happy with distributing modules together with
product, so while module has to support wide range of kernels, it
can support only one version of our product... It looks like that it
is better this way for both us (we can do incompatible changes) and 
for customers too (they do not have to use latest kernels).
Thanks for exporting install_page.
