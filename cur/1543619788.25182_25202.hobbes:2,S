Hi,
I have some linux kernel programming experience from the 2.0 days and I'd 
like to start programming it again, or at least understand the new 
features. Is there any really up-to-date information on 2.5, what's changed 
(build process, new VM, new this), what's new for developers eager to jump 
into kernel programming again? :)
Thanks for your cooperation,
Please cc me as I'm not on the list.
