My main concern is that BIOS vendors will not fix these bugs, as no
other OS cares/does this kind of thing today.  The ammount of bad
information out there might be quite large, and I think this was

Can the userspace tools that are using the existing directories thinking
that only hotplug slots are there, handle "non-hotplug" slots showing up
in this location?
