It didn't fix it for me, but the patch looks OK.
In __dentry_open() there's still a few places where fput() won't be
called, notably when ->open fails, which is what I'm triggering I
think.
Also even more horrible things can happen because of the
nd->intent.open.file thing.  For example if the lookup routine calls
lookup_instantiate_filp(), and after this, but before may_open() some
error happens, then release_open_intent() will call fput() on the
file, which will cause mnt_drop_write() to be called, even though a
matching mnt_want_write() hasn't yet been called.  Ugly, eh?

Yeah, something needs to be done with open, because currently it's way
too convoluted.
