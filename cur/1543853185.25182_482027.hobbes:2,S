Subject: [PATCH 000 of 4] md: Various fixes for new cache-bypassing-reads in raid5/6
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The patches which enable reading from raid5 without going through the
stripe cache have a bug which causes corruption when reading from a
raid6.
It might be appropriate to put out a hotfix for rc5-mm1 which reverts
   md-enable-bypassing-cache-for-reads.patch
The follow 4 patches fix this bug and a few other bugs I found while
re-reviewing and re-testing this code.  There are actually about 9
separate bugs here, but I grouped some of them to avoid having lots
of tiny patches.
