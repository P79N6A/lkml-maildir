Greetings - 
I'm getting the following error when compiling fault.c on test3-pre5:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/home/jrvb/dev/kernel/linux-2.4.0-test3-pre5/include
-Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -Werror
-fno-strict-aliasing -pipe   -march=i586   -c -o fault.o fault.c
cc1: warnings being treated as errors
fault.c: In function `do_page_fault':
fault.c:143: warning: `sem' might be used uninitialized in this function
The line in question is just
	down(&mm->mmap_sem);
The error goes away if I remove the "inline" modifier from the
definition of down() in include/asm-i386/semaphore.h, but this clearly
isn't the right thing to do...  ;-)  Does anyone have other suggestions?
