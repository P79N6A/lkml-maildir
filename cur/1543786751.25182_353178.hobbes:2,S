you're right, it's MIN() not MAX() ;-)
Anyway, I've checked the code and the compiler does a single test with -O2.

"likely", yes, but not necessarily. Under a high load, you can have enough
events queued so that epoll() will not wait at all. I've already encountered
such cases during benchmarks, and I noticed that epoll() took more time than
select() for small numbers of FDs (something like 20% below 100 FDs), but of
course, it is considerably faster above. So turning the multiply to an ULL
may increase this overhead on some architectures, while the double check
will leave the code identical.
