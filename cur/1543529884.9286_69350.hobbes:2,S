That's exactly why it gets very low latency without making Linux more
complicated or slow. The vast majority of users either need hard realtime
or don't and in both cases, the simplicity and high performance of 
Linux kernel is critical. If you want to sacrifice the core
value of the kernel, you should need a compelling argument.
BTW: there are RTLinux apps that process audio.
