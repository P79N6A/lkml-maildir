Indeed: NFS readahead requests are often processed out of order by the
server (due to the basic unordered nature of RPC calls, the lack of
ordering between nfsd server threads, use of UDP, etc) and so I suspect
the generic readahead algorithm will tend to default to the random
access mode in many cases where it should really be doing sequential
access.
