That'd be me.
> This patch adds support to the Linux kernel (tested on 2.4.18,
2.4.19-pre3 and 2.4.19-pre3-ac1) for the Belkin F5D6000 "Wireless
Desktop PCI Network Adapter".  This is a PLX PCI9502 based PCMCIA
adapter that allows 802.11b wireless network cards (mainly Prism2
based, like the Belkin F5D6020) to work on desktop boxen.
Applied.
