Okay. Since you've both given 'comforting' replies, I'll stop getting
worried, get on with finishing the 2.4 version of 1.1 and then get the
port up-to-date and going. But I'm still not sure what to prepare
patches against or who to send them to. Hopefully you'll have that
sorted by the time I'm ready to release 1.1 for 2.4.
Regards,
Nigel
