The spin-then-sleep lock could be interesting as a replacement for the 
BKL in places where a semaphore causes performance degredation.  In 
quite a few places where we replaced the BKL with a more finely grained 
semapore (not a spinlock because we needed to sleep during the hold), 
instead of spinning for a bit, it would schedule instead.  This was bad 
:).  Spin-then-sleep would be great behaviour in this situation.
