Personally I agree that if you want non blocking sockets that's what you 
should use, but many people expect that if select says a socket is 
readable then attempting to recieve that data will not block. Many people 
refer to Stevens "UNIX Network Programming" to find out how select and 
related networking functions are supposed to behave, and Stevens has this 
to say on page 153 under the heading "Under What Conditions Is a 
Descriptor Ready?" [1] : 
[...]
1. A socket is ready for reading if any of the following four conditions 
is true:
   a. The number of bytes of data in the socker recieve buffer is greater 
      than or equal to the current size of the low-water mark for the 
      socket recieve buffer. A read operation on the socket will not block 
      and will return a value greater than 0 ...
[...]
He's not saying this is specific to either UDP or TCP sockets nor blocking 
or non-blocking sockets, so I suspect that regardless of what POSIX might 
say a lot of people will be reading the above and assume that if select 
says a socket (any type of socket) is ready for reading, then attempting 
to read will not block. 
Using blocking sockets with select in this manner may be silly or 
inefficient, but I think many people expect it to work without the 
subsequent read blocking in any case.
[1] I'm only quoting what I think is relevant to the thread, but I can 
quote the rest if wanted. My copy of the book has ISBN 0-13-490012-X in 
case someone wants to check.
