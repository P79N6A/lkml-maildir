I have two minor comments on this topic.
1) Currently the PF driver is called before the kernel initializes VFs and
their resources, and the current API does not allow the PF driver to
detect that easily if the allocation of the VFs and their resources
has succeeded or not. It would be quite useful if the PF driver gets
notified when the VFs have been created successfully as it might have
to do further device-specific work *after* IOV has been enabled.
2) Configuration of SR-IOV: the current API allows to enable/disable
VFs from userspace via SYSFS. At the moment I am not quite clear what
exactly is supposed to control these capabilities. This could be
Linux tools or, on a virtualized system, hypervisor control tools.
One thing I am missing though is an in-kernel API for this which I
think might be useful. After all the PF driver controls the device,
and, for example, when a device error occurs (e.g. a hardware failure
which only the PF driver will be able to detect, not Linux), then the
PF driver might have to de-allocate all resources, shut down VFs and
reset the device, or something like that. In that case the PF driver
needs to have a way to notify the Linux SR-IOV code about this and
initiate cleaning up of VFs and their resources. At the moment, this
would have to go through userspace, I believe, and I think that is not
an optimal solution. Yu, do you have an opinion on how this would be
realized?
