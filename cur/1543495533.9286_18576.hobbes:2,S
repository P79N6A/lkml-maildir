The 'Cutting Edge Change Listing' web page 
(

 )
says : 
   [ 2.2.8 ] - Released 11-May-99 23:59 (patch [bz2]) (source [bz2])
   Notes: Due to the changes in this kernel's buffer code, you may want
   to disable the update (bdflush) daemon in your init scripts.
So I dont need  /sbin/update anymore ??
I read the sources ( I'm not sure which ones ! ) and it
seems that now update gets some error response and fails back to
some old behaviour, when it call sync() every 30 secs.
Maybe I should comment out update.
What do you think ?
