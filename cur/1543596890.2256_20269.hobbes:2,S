It _sounds_ like an X server problem (screen flashing, going blank).  Do
you have another machine available to see if the computer is still alive
(via ping, telnet, ssh, etc), or a serial console?
You could try setting your runlevel to 3 in /etc/inittab, or booting with
"single" on the kernel command line to avoid starting X right away at boot.
If the system boots to single user mode, then it is X that is the problem
(or at least a bad interaction between X and your kernel).

When you say SysRQ, does this include SysRQ-B for rebooting?  If so, that
may indicate a total lockup.
Cheers, Andreas
