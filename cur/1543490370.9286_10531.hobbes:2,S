I don't think such a large change is necessary.  Moving to 
IA-32 biases doesn't make the logic any more or less clear,
it only means that you can't rely on nice sign bits being set.
But you do point out the essential problem -- incrementing the
32-bit `count' in the 64-bit register when there are waiters
(count < 0) produces overflow into `waking'.
A tad more care in waking_non_zero_interruptible cures this.
