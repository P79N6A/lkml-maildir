I see... someone has added PF_NOFREEZE to all your drivers, so my
fragment is redundant. NO_FREEZE is fine in my mind - I would be seeking
to make all network driver threads NO_FREEZE in a while anyway, to allow
suspending over a network.
I'll double check the other fragments too, just in case the same thing
has happened there.
