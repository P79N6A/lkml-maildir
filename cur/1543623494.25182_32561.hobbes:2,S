	Not fully. In some cases, PPP does compression (and
potentially encryption), and at 4 Mb/s those operations can become
close to bottlenecks (at least, on my slow boxes). But at least, it's
constant latency, as opposed to IrDA latencies.

	By the way, same logic applies to PAN. In PAN it's easier,
because as PAN is a pseudo Ethernet driver you can fudge tx_queue_len
directly.

	Not yet. I'm finishing the current batch of IrDA fixes, and
other backlog of Wireless patches. I would also need to squeeze
buffers out of IrDA queues.
