We really *do* want to share code. We want both the user and kernel
code to use the same code paths for direct access to infiniband storage
devices, for example.
What I think is really needed is a mechanism for user level code to
call code provided by the loaded kernel module. I suspect this could be
done with some proper memory mappings and small user-level shim layers,
but I know there is something I'm forgetting.

Somone asked my why I work on this free (

)
software stuff and not get a real job. Charles Shultz had the best answer:
"Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems? They do it
because life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't. That's why
I draw cartoons. It's my life." -- Charles Shultz
