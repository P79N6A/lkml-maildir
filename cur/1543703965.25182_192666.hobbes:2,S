Hi,
Paul wrote a patch to use some of the rmap infrastructure to flush TLB
entries on ppc64. When testing it we found a problem in vmalloc where it
sets up the pte -> address mapping incorrectly. We clear the top bits of
the address but then forget to pass in the full address to
pte_alloc_kernel. The end result is the address in page->index is
truncated.
I fixed it in a similar way to how zeromap_pmd_range etc does it. Im
guessing no one uses the rmap hooks on vmalloc pages yet, so havent seen
this problem.
Anton
