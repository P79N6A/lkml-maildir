So you want to take a trip in the wayback machine, eh? 
Uncle Dan has just the ticket ;-) 
I have boot images for 0.95c (04/1992), Dick Zuccarini's linbin 
distribution (02/1992), and a slew of other molding Linux things
available.  Grab a small ide drive, and be on your way to joyous 
pain-filled days of routine filesystem crashes and darn little 
variety.  I wouldn't trade the world for them, but I would never
wish them on anyone else. 
While on the subject, is there a central repository for historical
Linux "stuff"? Several files in my collection are not in the usual 
places (./Historical at kernel.org mirrors).
