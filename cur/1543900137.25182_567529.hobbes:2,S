It just occurred to me:
 If i_version is 64bit, then knfsd would need to be careful when
 reading it on a 32bit host.  What are the locking rules?
 Presumably it is only updated under i_mutex protection, but having to
 get i_mutex to read it would seem a little heavy handed.
 Should it use a seqlock like i_size?
 Could we use the same seqlock that i_size uses, or would we need a
 separate one?
