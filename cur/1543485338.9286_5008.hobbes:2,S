No.  There is no way I'll support the idea of making set_blocksize
preserve data in the buffer cache.  That is just brain-dead.  So if
you want to go and change every filesystem in the kernel to support
non-local blocksizes, go right ahead.  
The "right" fix is to make set_blocksize fail on an in-use ramdisk,
NOT to support changing the blocksize for existing buffers.  Allowing
the user to set a correct blocksize via ioctl before mkfsing the
device in the first place makes a ton of sense, however.
