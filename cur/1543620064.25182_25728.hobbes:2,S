G'day,
After talking to some people, they confirm it is known, but what is the point of -r'ing binaries it if it can be read?
While it may not be a direct security threat, being able to look inside an otherwise unreadable binary can be a problem, for example, seeing if it is working or not, or possibly got entries for format strings.
Also some programs have a secret value inside them they use for authenication with remote clients. (Possibly Q by mixter @ mixter.warrior2k.com rings a bell).
While I guess there is no standard for ptrace, what do the other operating systems do? I've been told freebsd won't allow you to ptrace() a non-readable binary, but unable to confirm it myself.
