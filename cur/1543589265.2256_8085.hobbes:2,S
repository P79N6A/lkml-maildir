Subject: PATCH: linux-2.4.4/drivers/video/Config.in offered drivers that would not compile on your architecture
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

	linux-2.4.4/drivers/video/Config.in allowed the user to select
some Atari and SuperH architecture video drivers that would not compile
on other architectures.  This patch causes those drivers to be offered
only on architectures on which they will compile.
	By the way, this patch is much simpler than it looks.  It just
adds two "if" statements.  The rest of the chanages is just the
corresponding reindentation.
