topology_init() depends on the register_one_node() stuff being
available, which relies on register_node_type() being called AFAICT -
which is a postcore_initcall(). So that's OK.
It also creates sysfs files, which is OK because long before initcalls
run vfs_caches_init() called mnt_init() which called sysfs_init().
Just to be super safe it'd be good to diff your sysfs before and after
the change. But assuming that show's nothing this looks fine to me.
cheers
