So this is still a valid API? Good to know.
What I don't know: Can it be product specific? So the net people
ship a version for new networking APIs and filesystem people ship
new filesystem methods along with their filesystem support.
Reason I ask: There are many such frameworks floating around, but
none was complete. Many miss BUG_ON(), likely()/unlikely(),
seq_file support and many more interesting stuff.
