Well I whined about the rename of timer_list to ktimeout and asked why it
happened.  I don't think anyone replied.
I assume from your above statement that there wasn't really a strong reason
for the rename, and that a new patch series is in the offing, which adds
ktimers and leaves timer_list alone?
Is ktimer a better name than ptimer or hrtimer?
