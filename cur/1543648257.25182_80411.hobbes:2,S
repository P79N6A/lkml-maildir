It won't, the number of mappings will be exactly the same. It still needs
to mmap all the libraries and honour the protections.
But you might have holes in between the mappings if prelinking, while
you usually don't have many if not prelinking.
That's because prelink assigns a separate VA slot for each library (well,
with --conserve-memory two libraries might get the same VA slot if they
never appear together in any program).
