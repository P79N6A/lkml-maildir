I got this - I think it was this morning (somehow kernel logging was
disabled so I can't tell the exact time):

=============================================
[ INFO: possible recursive locking detected ]
---------------------------------------------
nfsd/1788 is trying to acquire lock:

but task is already holding lock:

other info that might help us debug this:

Also it doesn't seem to be related to smbfs AFAICS - I am not enough
into lock debugging to say if this is relevant, useful or just
noise...
