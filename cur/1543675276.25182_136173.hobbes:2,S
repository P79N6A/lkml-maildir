I have an ATI card that went nuts a couple years ago, ~4 months old, 
fizzled on boot.  Doesn't work in text mode at all, works fine in 
graphics mode however.  I have an old ISA card stuck in the machine so 
the machine will boot.  The motherboard doesn't recognize the AGP card 
without another video card installed.  This is the only motherboard that 
I can get it to work on.  The card simply doesn't work at all on any 
other m/board.
Good thing I run Linux, I don't think I'd have this option under winblows ;)
