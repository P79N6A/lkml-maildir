Subject: [patch 26/94] SCSI: aha152x_cs: Fix regression that keeps driver from using shared interrupts
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

2.6.28-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Larry Finger <Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net>
commit 58607b30fc0f2230a189500112c7a7cca02804cf upstream.
At some point since 2.6.22, the aha152x_cs driver stopped working and
started erring on load with the following messages:
kernel: pcmcia: request for exclusive IRQ could not be fulfilled.
kernel: pcmcia: the driver needs updating to supported shared IRQ lines.
With the following change, the driver works with shared IRQs.
