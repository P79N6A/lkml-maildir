That's right for 32-bit systems with 4k pages.  For 64 bit systems the
limit is over 8 Exabytes.
You should note that software raid has smaller limits, as does the
LVM.  Also the 2.4 patches have seen *much* less testing than the 2.6
mainline (except possibly on the SGI Altix).
What exactly are you trying to do?
