The thing is, most users of "m" (like 99%) actually mean "_THIS_ memory
location". So just fixing the "m" modifier was an easy way to make sure
that users get the behaviour they expect.
Also, I have this dim memory of there actually being a potential bug in
"m" handling inside gcc, and requiring the entry to be a lvalue was the
easiest way to fix it. Richard Henderson would have the details.  I think
it was the liveness analysis that got confused or something.
And the thing is, if you have a non-lvalue right now, you will (a) get a
nice warnign that tells you so, and (b) it will be trivial to fix. So
something like
	asm("xxxx" : :"m" (1+x));
can be trivially fixed to be
	{
		int tmp = 1+x;
		asm("xxxx" : : "m" (tmp));
	}
so it's not like it's a horribly undue burden on the programmer.
In the kernel, I don't think we had a _single_ case that needed this, but
I might remember that wrong. Anyway, it wasn't a problem - and the kernel
tends to be the single most active user of inline asm's of all
gcc-compiled projects.
