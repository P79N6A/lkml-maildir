Sorry for the late reply, but cosmic ray events (actually, self-induced alpha
particle events from decays within the chipset itself) *are* a likely
explanation:
http://stason.org/TULARC/pc/pc_hardware_faq/2_20_What_does_parity_ECC_memory_protect_the_system_from.html
Most important take-away here:
"With 100 million computers in use today, we should expect roughly 6 million
single bit errors per year. Computer hardware and software companies must
receive thousands of "side effect" bug reports and support calls due to memory
errors alone. The costs of NOT including parity memory must be huge!"
