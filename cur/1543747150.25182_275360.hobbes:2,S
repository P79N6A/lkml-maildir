Hi all...
I'm trying to get out of the mess that cd burning looks like nowadays in
linux...
As I use a 2.6.x kernel, I folowed this hints:
- no suid cdrecord, it uses capabilities
- make the burner owned by console user (pam)
cdrecord burns ok using dev=/dev/burner, but I can't get GUI tools to
burn using the /dev interface. All of them try to load ide-scsi, and
do a scan based on ATAPI:.
Some tools try to scan with dev=ATA:x:y:z, but that does not work as
normal user.
How can I make 'cdrecord dev=ATA -scanbus' work as non-root ?
TIA
