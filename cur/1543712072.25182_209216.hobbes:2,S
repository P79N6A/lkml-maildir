That's unfair to the two tasks which might be running on each virtual
CPU: one of the tasks is interrupted often.

What caused the suckage?  Obviously there's a small time spend doing
the work of rebalancing, but there is no cache hit from moving an
interrupt between virtual CPUs, unlike with SMP, so why did that make
performance suck?
