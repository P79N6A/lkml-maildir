Yes, if CPU_LOCK_ACQUIRE takes cache_chain_mutex, we don't need to do so
on CPU_DOWN_PREPARE. I didn't know cpuup_callback() was already converted,
sorry for the confusion!
Note: with the patch below we are doing cancel_rearming_delayed_work()
under cache_chain_mutex. This is ok since cache_reap() does mutex_trylock(),
so deadlock is not possible. However, this means that mutex_trylock() becomes
mandatory for cache_reap(), probably a little comment will be good.
