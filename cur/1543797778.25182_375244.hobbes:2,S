The instruction that crashes is
	testb  $0x80,0x1cd(%rdi)
with %rdi being 6b6b6b6b6b6b6b6b, which is the pattern that slab poisoning 
uses for free areas. 
I think it's the "sdev->single_lun" test at the very top of the function, 
where "sdev" was initialized with "q->queuedata". So it looks like 
somebody free'd the request_queue structure before the IO completed.
Definitely sounds like something screwy in SCSI.. I don't think this is VM 
related.
