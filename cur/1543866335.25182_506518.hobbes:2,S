Moving the sample rate computation to user space sounds like the right
idea, but why not have a more drastic version of it:
Right now, all products that support this feature run at the same clock
rate (3.2 Ghz), with cpufreq, we can reduce this to 1.6 Ghz. If I understand
this correctly, the value depends only on the frequency, so we could simply
hardcode this in the kernel, and print out a warning message if we ever
encounter a different frequency, right?

I thought it already did handle overlays, what did I miss here?

Doing the translation in two stages in user space, as you
suggest here, definitely makes sense to me. I think it
can be done a little simpler though:
Why would you need the accurate dcookie information to be
provided by the kernel? The ELF loader is done in user
space, and the kernel only reproduces what it thinks that
came up with. If the kernel only gives the dcookie information
about the SPU ELF binary to the oprofile user space, then
that can easily recreate the same mapping.
The kernel still needs to provide the overlay identifiers
though.

right.

yes, this sounds nice. But tt does not at all help accuracy,
only performance, right?

Yes, that would be a new feature if the kernel passed dcookie
information for every section, but I doubt that it is worth
it. I have not seen any program that allows loading code
from more than one ELF file. In particular, the ELF format
on the SPU is currently lacking the relocation mechanisms
that you would need for resolving spu-side symbols at load
time.

This seems to incur a run-time overhead on the SPU even if not
profiling, I would consider that not acceptable.
