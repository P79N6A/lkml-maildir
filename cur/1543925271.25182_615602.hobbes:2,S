While it's a little premature, we can start thinking of irq path 
improvements.
The current patch acks a private isr and afterwards apic eoi will also 
be hit since its
a level trig irq. This means 2 vmexits per irq.
We can start with regular pci irqs and move afterwards to msi.
Some other ugly hack options [we're better use msi]:
    - Read the eoi directly from apic and save the first private isr ack
    - Convert the specific irq line to edge triggered and dont share it
What do you guys think?
