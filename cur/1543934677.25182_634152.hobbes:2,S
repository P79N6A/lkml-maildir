I suspect it would be a good idea anyways to reevaluate the power of two
slabs. Perhaps a better distribution can be found based on some profiling?
I did profile kmalloc using a systemtap script some time ago but don't
remember the results exactly, but iirc it looked like it could be improved.
A long time ago i also had some code to let the network stack give hints
about its MMUs to slab to create fitting slabs for packets. But that
was never really pushed forward because it turned out it didn't help
much for the most common 1.5K MTU -- always only two packets fit into
a page.
