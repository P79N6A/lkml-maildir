In a typical system, most applications are started at the correct level,
and we don't have to demote/promote them. In those cases where demotion
or promotion are needed, only a small number actually already have
access that needs to be revoked. Of those, most involve shmem, which
I believe we are revoking safely, as we don't have the same problems
with drivers and incomplete I/O. In the remaining cases, where we really
can't revoke safely, we could simply not allow the requested access, and
not demote/promote the process.
I think this would give us a useful balance of allowing "safe" demotion
or promotions, while not requiring general revocation. Does this sound
like a reasonable approach?
