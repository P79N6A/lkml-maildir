hmm, just a removal of (X86_SUMMIT || X86_GENERICARCH). When I was testing
this I was probably using a PC-compatible configuration as that is what I
was enabling at the time. It's a similar restriction for BOOT_IOREMAP.

Presumably a GENERICARCH configuration

I don't think it has bit-rotted. I was just not using a GENERICARCH
configuration.

Yeah, elm3b6 from test.kernel.org is an Opteron-based NUMA machine. Oddly
it's good to know that the nature of the crash has not changed.

Unfortunately, I don't have access to a Summit box so I cannot verify.

Grand. I'll get back to this soon and see what can be done.
