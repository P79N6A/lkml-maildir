	I hasten to add that, while I think that the binary firmware
images that I believe violate the GPL should be removed from the
kernel immediately, there are also some binary firmware images
covered by GPL compatible copying permissions, which include
source code, such as xircom_pgs.S.  For the GPL-compatible
firmware binaries that include source code, I have no problem
with a six month warning period.
