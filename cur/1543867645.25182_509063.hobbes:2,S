Can't tell.  AHCI needs very few MMIOs to perform each request.  As Andi 
suggested, please do oprofile.  It's easy.

The default iosched is heavily optimized for regular disks with moving 
head and for more usual workload.  Requests are sometimes paused to wait 
for requests in adjacent area.  Use deadline or noop for ssd.
Also, try turn off NCQ.  Some of early drives from major disk vendors 
had all kinds of issues with NCQ implementation.  SSD firmwares don't 
tend to be of high quality.

As written above, the first thing I can think of is interaction with 
iosched.  SSD and your workload are pretty unusual.

Dunno much about that.  Where's the test result?

Other ppl have pointed out but use /dev/sdX not the raw devices.  If you 
use raw, you end up writing each chunk synchronously.
