I got the spurious interrupt with both Linux 2.6.28.1 and 2.6.27.12 as
guests.  The host runs 2.6.9-42.0.3.ELsmp.
I am putting OpenVPN and Asterisk inside the guest.  The guest is based
on Ubuntu 8.10.  The spurious interrupt happened more often when I
restricted the guest's RAM.  The processes in the guest normally consume
a total of about 20-24 MB of RAM.  I limited the guest's RAM to 48 MB
and gave it a 64 MB swap partition.  When I gave the guest only 32 MB,
the spurious interrupt seemed to happen more often.
The best way I found to trigger the spurious interrupt was to try to
"apt-get install" many packages at once.  The download would succeed,
but the guest would freeze partway through the install.
