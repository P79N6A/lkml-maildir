Hi Sam,
These patches are certainly getting better and better broken out all the
time.  Nice work.
But, I worry that they just aren't generic enough yet.  I don't see any
response from any of the other "container/namespace/vps" people.  I fear
that this means that they don't look broadly useful enough, yet.
That said, at this point, I'd just about rather have _anything_ merged
than the nothing we have at this point.  As we throw patches back and
forth, we can't seem to agree on even some very small points.  
I also have a sinking feeling that everybody has gone back off and
continues to develop their own out-of-tree functionality, deepening the
patch divide.
Is there anything we could merge that we _all_ don't like?  I'm pretty
convinced that no single solution will support Eric's, OpenVZ's, and
VServer's _existing_ usage models.  Somebody is going to have to bend,
or nothing will ever get merged.  Any volunteers? ;)
What about going back to the very simple "struct container" on which to
build?
