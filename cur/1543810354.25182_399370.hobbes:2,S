Could you provide more detail? If there's something I can do to make it easier 
to use, I'm more than willing to consider that.

I'm not sure I get what you're saying I didn't seem to mind.
Your comment about using bitmaps made me do some math to see how much I'm 
saving by using them instead of Pavel's struct pbes. I don't think they were 
commented on as 'totally unacceptable', but as I look at them again now, I'm 
not so sure they're worth the effort. Will look again a little later in the 
day, particularly at the flow on effects of making such a change - perhaps 
I've forgotten something else).
(For the record, my thinking went: swsusp uses n (12?) bytes of meta data for 
every page you save, where as using bitmaps makes that much closer to a 
constant value (a small variable amount for recording where the image will be 
stored in extents). 12 bytes per page is 3MB/1GB. If swsusp was to add 
support for multiple swap partitions or writing to files, those requirements 
might be closer to 5MB/GB. Bitmaps, in comparison, use ~32K/GB (approx 
because it depends whether the gigabyte is all in one zone). Proportionally, 
bitmaps are eating a lot less space out of your gigabyte, but I don't think 
anyone is going to notice that they have 3 or 4MB more cache per gigabyte 
with Suspend2 than they have with swsusp).

Nigel
