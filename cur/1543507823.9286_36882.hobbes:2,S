We need to be able to do this with code too.  Modules that will never be
used in a kernel's lifetime should be discarded.
My portable library for S3 video hardware will eventually have several
modules.  For example, the s3generic, s3virge, and s3virge_video modules
might be needed if you are a ViRGE owner, but the s3trio and s3savage
modules would not be needed.
