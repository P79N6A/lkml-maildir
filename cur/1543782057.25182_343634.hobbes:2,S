Yes, I know this, and I haven't experienced that much trouble with
deadlocks.  Maybe the way you structure and access the database
environment can be optimized for deadlock avoidance?

If I understand you correctly, what you really need is a syscall along
the lines "don't run me again until all threads T that share property
X have run, where the Ts aren't necessarily in the same process".  The
kernel is psychic, it can't really know which processes to schedule to
satisfy such a requirement.  I don't even think "has joined the
Berkeley DB environment" is the desired property, but something like
"is part of this cycle in the wait-for graph" or something similar.
I would have to check the Berkeley DB internals in order to tell what
is feasible to implement.  This code shouldn't be on the fast path, so
some kernel-based synchronization is probably sufficient.
