hrtimers don't have the cost of a normal timer. And that's why I suggested
to convert them.  There's a much bigger cost in a single timer that always
times out than 3 hrtimers.  hrtimers are expected to timeout, but timers
are not.
Of the 4 timers, only one is a timeout. The other three expire every time,
forcing the timer wheel into effect.  Even though it's one timer
implementing 4, it's expensive to use it as a watchdog.
