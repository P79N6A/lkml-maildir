Ok, that is acceptable, but how big is this buffer in
2.0.36?  There seem to be log entries that are much longer than
the ones that are chopped off, and the part chopped off is
consistently the *START* of the buffer, not the end.  Odd.  I
don't know if the same occurs under 2.2.x or not..
It breaks the logfiles anyways and makes perl/grep parsing a
nightmare and practically useless...  If anyone has a fix, I'd
appreciate it.
Thanks,
