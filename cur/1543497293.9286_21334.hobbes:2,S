The problem with that script or any method that uses shell redirection
is that the shell tries to open /dev/modem without the O_NONBLOCK flag.
On /dev/cua* it usually works, on /dev/ttyS* it often hangs waiting for
the device to open.  Remember that the shell tries to open redirectoed
files before it runs the script, without shell support for O_NONBLOCK
it is doomed to failure on /dev/ttyS*.
