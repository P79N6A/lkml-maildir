The release of any new kernel doesn't make all existing hardware
on the planet stop working.  I still get requests to enable
drivers in the Fedora kernel for 10 year old ISA sound cards.
In some parts of the world, buying a new computer isn't an option.
One of Linux's strengths is that we keep working on old hardware
without forcing the user to upgrade their system every time
like certain commercial OS's.
