It would be very nice to do but AFAIK no current processor with
hypedthreading lets you do dynamic disabling. We do try and land tasks
on the real processors before other SMT threads and to leave the other
threads idle. I'm not sure we could do much more unless flipping the
cache control bits on packages when idle is a win (which I doubt)
