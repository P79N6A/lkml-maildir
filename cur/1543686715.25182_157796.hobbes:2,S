I was connected to the net with a modem, there was no reply (it's the fault
of my ISP), and I got this in the syslog:
Aug 15 23:23:37 localhost pppd[1871]: No response to 4 echo-requests
Aug 15 23:23:37 localhost pppd[1871]: Serial link appears to be disconnected.
The modem was still online. After running poff:
Aug 15 23:23:43 localhost pppd[1871]: Connection terminated.
Aug 15 23:23:43 localhost pppd[1871]: Connect time 4.2 minutes.
