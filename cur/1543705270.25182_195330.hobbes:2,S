I think the right fix is to update the Linux i_size always shortly after
di_size is updated.  There's a lot of updates in the directory code while
should be handled by an i_size_write in the matching linvfs routines, and
there's a few more but we should be able to handle those without
vn_revalidate aswell.

That's the more difficult case.  Any reson why you'd hold i_sem
for the whole O_DIRECT I/O instead of just for updating i_sem?
Note that the EOF zeroing code also calls i_size_write.
