Ok, so is there any real _reason_ to have filenames quite this ugly?
I'd love to have agp split up sanely, but "sanely" does imply that a via
driver is called "via.c", since the "be" part ("backend") is completely
silly (of _course_ a chipset driver is a "backend" driver, it sure as
hell aint frontend), and that "agpgart_" prefix is kind of silly, since
the whole subdirectory is clearly about AGP. 
Having filenames that repeat is redundant, excessive, exorbitant, and
superfluous. 
If you want the redundancy, duplication and profusion, please keep it
shorter.  And put it at the end, so that at least filename completion
works well: "via-agp.c".
Ok?
