    Hi Jamie :))
>Sorry folks, but I found this bounce from a message I sent to

    Oh, just funny. According to some... person here in the list,
you're a twit and this filter solves a problem for you: your
obviously weak mind is using dirty words for expressions since you
cannot find a clean and religiously acceptable word.
    Now seriously ;)) This filter is plain censorship and your fail
has been namely:
>Given the user will need to establish a new mapping anyway, why pussy
    That 'pussy' has caused the filter to complain, but don't worry
about that, because your message will go to LKML without problems and
the one affected is that user that suffers the filter censorship, who
wouldn't be able to read your posts. The rest of the list will read
it without any problem :) Next time try to use 'charming little cat'
instead of 'pussy' XDDD And obviously don't use words like 'fuck',
'shit', 'elderberry' or 'nih' to avoid that filter :)
