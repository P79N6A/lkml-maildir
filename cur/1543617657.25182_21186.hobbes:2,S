I've got a Micronics M54Pe dual Pentium EISA/PCI board.  It is the one
that I'm sending this message from.  I've also got some 486 motherboards
which have PCI and VLB.  I got rid of my EISA only 486 board.
I was looking at the pci.ids stuff, and haven't figured out how to modify
the entry for the Intel 82375EB to make it a PCI to EISA bridge and have
it discovered correctly in /proc/pci.
Let me know if there is anything I can do to help.
Thanks,
