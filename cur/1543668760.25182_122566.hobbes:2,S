I tried 2.4.21-pre5-ac3 but still I get the same problems, with what
settings did you compile the kernel?
I used these:
On:  PROMISE PDC202{46|62|65|67} support
On:  Special UDMA Feature
On:  PROMISE PDC202{68|69|70|71|75|76|77} support
Off: Special FastTrak Feature
Off: Support for IDE Raid controllers (EXPERIMENTAL)
Yours sincerey, Jonathan Vardy
