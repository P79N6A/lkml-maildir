Yes this was the problem with my early_reserve node bootmem patch.
It adds a node limit.
But even with increasing the limit is far too small. Probably best to not 
use the patch. In theory it should not have been needed anyways because
there is no need to reserve here because there are no interfering users.
Whatever your problem is it needs to be solved differently.
