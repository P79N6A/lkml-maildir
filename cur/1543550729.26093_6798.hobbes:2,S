Please include your patches inline so we can easily quote them via the
standard e-mail reply feature.
i2o_block.c: you don't need EXPORT_NO_SYMBOLS (yes, I know it was there
before)
sd.c: why do you add two blank lines, but change nothing else?
sg.c: ug.  the worst part of the patch.  you revert some of doug
gilbert's correct changes, which went in after test9-pre9.  This is
way wrong, so maybe it's a version/diff problem?
