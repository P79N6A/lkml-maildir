It's true, that the RH 6.2 scripts only remount the root-FS read-only
before rebooting if it is on ext2. This is only true for the root-FS
(not any other FS), and I could check this only on RH 6.2 (Don't know
about RH 7.x, I'd guess that they fixed it). If you don't have your
root-FS on Reiser / XFS / JFS, you have no problem with RH 6.x
The FAQ entry from namesys is just misleading.
