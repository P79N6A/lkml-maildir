You could probably use QEMU to run windows binaries on ppc. It has some 
kind of user-mode (per process) emulation and it was designed (at the 
begining) exactly to run wine on !x86. I do not know if the wine emulation 
is still supported (because Fabrice is mainly working on whole-system 
emulation), but you can fix any issues with never wine versions in 5 
minutes I will bet two beers... :-)
And some windows programs to test can be found on the Internet.
Thanks,

PS. Thanks for your work Fabrice!
