There are two ways to deal with this.
Either the kernel can unconditionally invoke /kinit, which then would 
invoke the users /init if present, or the swsusp can be a separate 
initramfs binary which the user's initramfs gets to invoke (the second 
is arguably neater, but requires minor changes to the users initramfs.)
Either way, it's a trivial problem to solve.
