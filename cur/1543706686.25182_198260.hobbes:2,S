I reported a bug in 2.6.2-rc3-mm1 and was asked to retest... result is
it's still broken.  The result is the same - even a little worse now, it
won't get as far as running init so I have no log to post.  This machine
has no serial port and I haven't tried the network logging stuff yet...
But the oops looked very similar.  At least the function names and the
references to ieee1394 are the same.  The 2.6.2-rc3-mm1 oops was:
