well, i can agree with the warning being pointless on KVM paravirt, but 
it's not pointless in the Qemu context.
we fundamentall _dont_ trust the BIOS's MTRR settings, just check the 
very function that you modified: mtrr_trim_uncached_memory() - that 
function handles _exactly_ a case where a BIOS messes up MTRR's. This 
problem has caused real user-side breakage and just not emitting a 
warning because Qemu is lazy to emulate a proper PC is not a strong 
enough argument.
so i've applied the KVM bits but the warning stays for Qemu.
