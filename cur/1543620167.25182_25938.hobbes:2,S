73% of CPU time is idle! So priorities will make no (or little)
difference.

since there is lots of idle CPU time left, the only thing that could make
a difference is timeslice length.
to 'fix' this (temporarily), renice all the non-SCHED_FIFO processes to
nice +19, that will give them the minimum timeslice length.
still dropped sound? If this fixes it then we can think about ways to fix
it for real.
again, what does it need to cause the 'bad' situation - too much latency
in the sound delivery path causing the audio buffers to starve? (or audio
buffers to be dropped?)

idle time in this snapshot too.
