2.2.5 will not seem to support my INI9100A SCSI card while 2.0.37-pre
works just fine.
I copied the ini9100* and i90* files from the 2.0.37-pre over but I get
the same problem:
System sees the controller on bootup, resets the bus, but fails to find
any drives. Is there an exact list of all files I should try to move over
to 2.2.5? I suppose I could try moving the entire drivers/scsi dir.
2.2.5 continiues to reset the bus and always times out looking for
devices.
