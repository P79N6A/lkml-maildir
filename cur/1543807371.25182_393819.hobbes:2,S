It's a GIT version of an RC patch for grief's sake!  You don't  
seriously expect people to quadruple-check every trivial patch that  
goes into Linus GIT tree before sending it, do you?  The whole point  
of the RC is to indicate that only smaller patches should be applied  
(and this one was for the most part) so that we can do some kind of  
global-kernel QC.

Precisely!  The guy who reported the bug is the one person who was  
burdened with it.  It will get fixed in the GIT tree, and only  
somebody who happened to test the dev tree between the two patches  
with that particular .config will have noticed.
BTW: Nice way to CC a private thread to a public list without the  
consent of all parties.  You also made the grievous errors of (A) top- 
posting, (B) fullquoting without snipping irrelevant material, and  
(C) sending flamebait to the list (which I am so stupidly responding  
to).
Cheers,
