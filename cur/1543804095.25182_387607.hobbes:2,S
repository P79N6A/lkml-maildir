That might be suitable.  It's a no-op on most platforms, but it's only
used by a handful of drivers:
        drivers/scsi/qla1280.c
        drivers/sn/ioc4.c
        drivers/net/bnx2.c
        drivers/net/sky2.c
        drivers/net/s2io.c
        drivers/net/tg3.c
If the semantics were to change so that it really did a write barrier, I
doubt any existing users would notice.  In fact, based on the comments
in some drivers, at least some authors think it does already, when it
typically doesn't.
