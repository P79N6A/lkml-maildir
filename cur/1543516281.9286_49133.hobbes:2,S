I happen to agree with you but other people don't.  So we have worked
out a compromise: we're do a partial tree because there are people who
want to work in BitKeeper on Linux and they all want to work on the same
tree so they can all (eventually) sync up.  One problem that BK has is 
that if the same tarball is used to create two different repositories,
BK thinks that the repositories contain unrelated stuff.  
Anyway, so what we did is come up with a way of leaving little markers in
the files which say "this file may have a gap right here" so we can later
go fill in the gaps for the people who want all the history and still
interoperate with the people who want to work in a lighter weight pruned
tree.
So everyone will be happy eventually :-)
