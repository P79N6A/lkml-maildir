Kernel 2.4.1-ac15, 3ware driver.
512mb ram, amd thunderbird 1000, 3ware escalade 6400 with 2 x 45gb IBM
in raid5 mode.
'iozone 512 16384' is a guaranteed, repeatable way to totally kill this
machine.
The kernel starts spitting out a zillion of
"Warning - running *really* short on DMA buffers"
And then it starts going endlessly into a loop of
"3w-xxxx: tw_scsi_eh_abort(): Abort failed for unknown Scsi_Cmnd 0xe7da6e00, resetting card 0."
And the system is completely unresponsive, locked up.
