There seems to be some bad interaction between PCI VECTOR 
(use_pci_vector()) and ACPI PRTs. Namely, both mp_parse_prt() and 
pcibios_fixup_irqs() do the IO_APIC_VECTOR() translation on irq, the 
result being  IO_APIC_VECTOR(IO_APIC_VECTOR(irq)). I wonder if this is 
the cause of some bug reports with acpi and pci vector? Maybe 
mp_parse_prt() should not do the irq->vector translation?
