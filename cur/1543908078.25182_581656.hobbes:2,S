What's the EBDA actually used for?  The only place which seems to use
ebda_addr is in the e820 code to avoid that area as RAM.
Seems to me that we can just arrange to have the early lguest/xen setup
code set the EBDA_ADDR pointer to NULL and make discover_ebda() special
case that to zero out ebda_addr/size.

Yeah, it seems a bit hamfisted.  Looks like it would be better to deal
with it by some combination of:
   1. implement pv analogues of existing functions
   2. try to neutralize functions we don't care about in pv-land
   3. refactoring the setup() function to make the pv-friendly and
      pv-hostile parts clearly distinct
and remember: native isn't a special case; its just another pv driver.
