I don't have a good feel for the PAG data structure, perhaps the
above would turn out as overkill.  The security api is commented in
include/linux/security.h, take a gander there.  The blobs are specific
to the security model, and I don't yet see a need to display them to
userspace for each PAG.

Hmm, not really.  The source is best.
