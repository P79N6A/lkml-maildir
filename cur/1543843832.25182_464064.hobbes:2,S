Hi,
If I may, if nothing marks the interest of the tracer in the "x" variable, what
happens when a kernel guru changes it for y (because it looks a lot better). The
code will not compile anymore when the markup marks the interest for x, when
your "dynamic tracer" markup will simply fail to find the information. My point
is that the markup of the interesting variables should follow code changes,
otherwise it will have to be constantly updated elsewhere (hmm ? Documentation/
someone ?)
I would say that not marking a static variable just because it is less visually
intrusive is a not such a good thing to do. That's not because we *can* that we
*should*.
