Hi Ricky,
And I know it was working on this very machine some time in the past
with a 2.2.x.  Where are you seeing these notes ?  Only refs to the
7100 I can see are for patching in atapi support into 2.0.x :)
(quick poke around the doc directory in the rh7 cdrecord-1.9 package
/ looking at the web site)
Where did you see this noted ?  I have the latest HP firmware
(3.01) loaded on the 7100i, so the notes wrt firmware 2.02 I found on 
http://www.fadden.com/cdrfaq/faq05.html#
[5-1-5] hopefully got
resolved.
*source for the very latest cdrecord alpha (10a4) is just downloading*
Mark
