Name collisions aren't a big issue, but certainly a consideration.  A
big motivation for me is scalability...  what happens when you load a
bunch of drivers, all of which dump straight into /proc root?  You get a
huge ls listing.  It's bad enough when you have tons of processes (and
tons of pid inodes) in /proc.  I don't want drivers to start doing that
too.
IMHO driver-specific /proc entries should go under directory
/proc/driver/$DRIVER.  If there exists a general /proc interface for a
specific capability, only then should it go elsewhere.  That at least
encourages driver authors to consider a sane /proc namespace which
scales with independent decisions made by other driver authors.
