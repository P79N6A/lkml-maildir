Please let me understand... The code does something like:
0 disable interrupts
....
....
1 set reschedule flag
2 enable interrupts
3 iret
If an interrupt occurs betweet 2 and 3 the flag value gets lost.
What means interrups are disabled ?  Incoming ints are simply ignored (I
really don't thin this is the case) or are they queued ? Because in that
case we get an int immediately after the enable-int call, and the window
where we can get an int is 0-3, and not 2-3. Way larger.
Bye.
