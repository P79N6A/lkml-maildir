Actually I think having module parameter is OK as long as we have
comlementing device attribute. Then user has an option to either
specify default value for the parameter at load/boot time or fiddle
with an individual device.

I believe tslib handles this.

Yes, but evdev is the interface between input layer and userspace. If
we ever implement in-kernel calibration I think we'll add
recalibrate() method to input device structure and have EVIOCSABS
ioctl handler call it. But I'd look at tslib first. I believe Qt,
Xserver, etc support it.
