Actually, it's not difficult to make Bugzilla to do things like sending out ALL
bugs updates emails to certain email adress(es), on a global basis or
per-module. Also, it is relatively easy to make Bugzilla _accept_ bugs updates
through email, from additional comments (+ attachments) to
status/priority/target/... changes.
It works quite nicely for us (ELinks) and it took just few hours to set up
properly (we had to touch the BZ sources, but just a little, the rest are
external support scripts). What is missing is some email interface for querying
the database (shouldn't be difficult to do, though), but if you just want to
file/update bugs, all you need is to:
* have the new bugs posted on the mailing list
* keep bugzilla in the cc list through the whole thread, as long as it's
relevant at least ;-)
* don't remove [Bug 12345] from the subject
If Martin would like some know-how about how to set things up, I could share
what we've done with him.
Kind regards,
