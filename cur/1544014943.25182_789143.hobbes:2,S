 - If retruns NULL, only global LRU's status is updated. 
Because this page is not belongs to any memcg, we cannot update
any counters. But yes, your point is a concern.
Maybe moving acitvate_page() to
==
do_swap_page()
{
    
- activate_page()
   mem_cgroup_try_charge()..
   ....
   mem_cgroup_commit_charge()....
   ....
+  activate_page()   
}
==
is necessary. How do you think, kosaki ?
Thanks,
