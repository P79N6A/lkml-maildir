Hmm..from include/asm-arm/arch-clps711x/memory.h
==
/*
 * Given a kaddr, LOCAL_MAR_NR finds the owning node of the memory
 * and returns the index corresponding to the appropriate page in the
 * node's mem_map.
 */
#define LOCAL_MAP_NR(addr) \
        (((unsigned long)(addr) & (NODE_MAX_MEM_SIZE - 1)) >> PAGE_SHIFT)

Is this comment wrong ???
I already posted patch against 2.6.17-rc1. so, please NACK for it.
sorry for annoying.
Thanks,
