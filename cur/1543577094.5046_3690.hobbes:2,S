Hi,

consistently dies (hard lock up and no messages, sysrq
also dead) after 18 or 19 days. Here's my uptime
recorded with ud:

One  : 19 day(s), 05:40:45 running Linux
2.4.0-test8-pre1, ended Mon Sep 18 16:41:05 2000
Two  : 19 day(s), 01:26:55 running Linux 2.4.0-test10,
ended Sun Dec 31 13:01:10 2000
Three: 18 day(s), 20:46:43 running Linux 2.4.0-test8,
ended Thu Oct 12 11:50:10 2000
