It wouldn't surprise me if serial PNP can be tripped up by the
incomplete Linux PNP code or by buggy firmware.  If you find any
issues like that, I'll fix them.

You're right about that, and it is a legitimate issue.  But given the
fact that (PNP && !SERIAL_8250_PNP) should be relatively unusual, my
opinion is that it's not worth extra ifdefs in legacy_serial.c.
If you have to use any workarounds like "legacy_serial.force", I think
that's a bug, and I'll fix it.
