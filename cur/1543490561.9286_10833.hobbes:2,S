	Sorry Ray, my serial ports are all spelled out correctly. Demesg
is correct in the serial part at least...:-) 
	Point of referance: I ran an installfest last weekend. Used the
Mandrake-Red Hat Cheapbytes cd-rom. About 4 users took the 2.2.1 kernel
that is supplied. All 4 came by last week and complained and had to load
the old kernel. These are collage kids.

} I had a problem very similar to this when I upgraded my server to 2.2.1.
} It turned out that the newer kernel was detecting my 16550A UART's as
} 16750's.  Commenting out the 16750 detection code fixed it.
} 
} Your problem is probably something different as I suspect the incorrect
} detection is rare, but check the output of dmesg just in case.

} Hope that helps,
