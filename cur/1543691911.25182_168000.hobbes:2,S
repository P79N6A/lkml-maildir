I wasn't whining about BK at all, nor about the licence, I just
advertized the open links in my signature, the word "refuse" may be not
a nice one, I didn't feel to be rude when I wrote it, now I changed it
and I hope it's a more friendly wording, though the meaning it's the
same.

I defend his right to the licence, it makes perfect business sense, if
he wanted to be safer he had to take a couple of patents too I guess
(but I'm not a lawyer and I certainly prefer the licence to the
patents). I don't think I ever complained to the licence.  I only said
I'm not applying to the licence and _you_ have to respect my _right_ not
to use the software and to advertize the _open_ links, without seeing it
as an offensive thing.
