The mapping I am talking about is currently done inside libscg (inside
the scsi-*.c files). Hence libscg is the one capable of exposing this
information to higher levels.

The information printed will be printed in a format such as:
b,t,l <= os_specific_name
This information is obviously not completely OS dependent (the
os_specifc_name is OS specific). But it is exactly this information
that would make your program integrable with OS specific user
interfaces. And this information would only be outputted.
Think about it in term of high level interface:
struct mapping {
  btl btl;
  char* name;
}
mapping* get_drives();
void burn(btl, ....)
To use your b,t,l naming effectively, we need to have a way to
identify it correctly. and no scanbus is not sufficient because what
is needed is the btl to os specific name.

I don't want to change anything cdrecord does. wrapper programs will
still use your dev=b,t,l on all platforms. The publicised mapping
would allow program to identify the correct b,t,l value.
How does that sound?
