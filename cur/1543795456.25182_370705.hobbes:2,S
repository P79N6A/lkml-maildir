This looks like the MPIIX datasheet:
http://www.mit.edu/afs/sipb/contrib/doc/specs/unfiled/i82371MX.pdf
Also, may or may not want to bother with looking at supporting another chip
- the never-actually-released-by-Intel i82600 integrated single chip
north/south bridge.  This chipset design (can you still call it a chipset if
it only has one chip?) is licensed from Intel, and sold by Radisys.  The
docs are here:
http://www.radisys.com/service_support/tech_solutions/techsupportlib_detail.

I have it working fine with the ide/pci driver in PIO, and UDMA, but not
MDMA modes, but haven't had a chance to revisit it, but it is on my TODO
list...
Tim.
