It's not from the lock functions, but from do_fast_gettimeoffset():
	register unsigned long eax asm("ax");
	register unsigned long edx asm("dx");
The locking functions use eax for passing args in/out when calling the
helper functions if the variable doesn't have a static address.
Unfortunately, gcc 2.7.2 isn't getting the optimization correct
(&time_lock is a constant).  Remove the inline from do_fast_gettimeoffset
and it should compile.
