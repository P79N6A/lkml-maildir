I would say that (excluding stability issues because of jiffies wrap)
that this is ready for submission to Linus.  He may be of the mind that
he would rather fix the wrap issues sooner rather than later, or he
may want to minimize disruption during the "VM stabilize" period (there
are still a couple of hang issues apparently).

        ^^^^^^ jiffies_tmp doesn't need to be static.
One suggestion someone had was to put dummy "get_jiffies64()" calls
in some other infrequently used areas to ensure jiffies_hi is valid
if we don't call uptime for 1.3 years after the first wrap.  I don't
know if that matters or not.
