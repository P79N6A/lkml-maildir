One of the reasons that alloc_delays() is a bit ugly is to handle the case
that tasks might get created between the two loops. Even with RCU kind of
locking (except for changing the locking primitives of-course), this code would
work fine. Once delayacct_on is set to 1, copy_process() should take care of
allocating the delays structure. alloc_delays() re-iterates through the list
of tasks to find tasks whose allocation got missed. This revisit happens
at most once due to the small window in which we check for delayacct_on
and allocate the task's delays structure. If tasks are missed within that
window, we revisit the tasks again and allocate for them.
Even with RCU kind of locking, this code should be able to gracefully
deal with tasks getting created/lost between the scanning of the tasklist.
