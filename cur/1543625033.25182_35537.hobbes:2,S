Ok, so basically we want both fadvise() and open(2) semantics, with the 
open(2) being a superset of the fadvise() capabilities (some things no 
longer make sense to be specified once the file is open). They can of 
course both be calling the same common helpers inside the kernel...
fadvise() would probably only be used by databases while open(2) would be 
used by the rest of the world. (-;
Best regards,
Anton
[1] Sorry about the flame bait, couldn't resist...  I know they are both 
very respectable databases and they are free software which is great.
