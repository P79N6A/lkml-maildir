It's not a bug --- it's an alignment constraint, just like the zone
alignment one.  If your physical memory doesn't start on an aligned
boundary, then you just have some missing pages in the mem_map.  The
PG_RESERVED mem_map page flag can be (and is) used to indicate exactly
that sort of unaccessible page.
