You may want to try again this untarring, but this time using usenetfs
from the FIST stacking filesystem software package
   
http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~ezk/research/software/
It is going to do exactly what many people here suggested (ie the
ala-squid multiple directories).

I contacted the author.
