It is not only related to TCP/IP performance. it is related to whole
OS performance. especially performance of file system and stablity,
network driver performance etc.
FreeBSD with softupdates turned on seems horrible fast and stable.
but Linux 2.4 is horrible fast in TCP/IP too. diffcult to compare between
in Linux and FreeBSD. don't do such stupid thing. you'll never get a
correct result.
