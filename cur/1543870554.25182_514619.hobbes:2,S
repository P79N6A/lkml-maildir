no - i simply picked them by hand, based on looking at gittk output, 
because bisection did not appear to find anything useful:
  9f4bd5dde81b5cb94e4f52f2f05825aa0422f1ff is first bad commit
And via that method i found a couple of more 'good' points - which 
git-bisect never picked up by itself. (and i did 3-4 separate git-bisect 
sessions, one of them was a "git-bisect start drivers/acpi/" - which is 
the main area of suspicion). I looked at git-bisect visualize more than 
once, and i've attached one of the bisection logs below.
i also think i know what happens. Firstly, my testing is reliable, as i 
mentioned it in the other mail i frequently re-visited commits to make 
sure that none of my bad/good decisions is spurios - but no, the test 
results are extremely reproducable: either the laptop resumes properly 
after flashing its disk light or it does not.
the problem i think is that i simply took git-bisect's behavior for 
granted (i used it many times already) but forgot about a very basic 
precondition: git-bisect will find only a /single/ good->bad transition.
If there is a bad->good transition combined with a good->bad transition 
then git-bisect will think it's the same 'badness', while it's a 
/former/ badness that it is honing in on - totally sending the bisection 
off into la-la-land.
so as i mentioned it in the first mail: i /know/ that this commit is a 
bad->good transition point:
  f3ccb06f3b8e0cf42b579db21f3ca7f17fcc3f38
/and i only want to test commits that include this commit/ - because i 
know that without this commit git-bisect confuses the /other/ breakage 
with the new breakage. In the bisection log below, this choice of 
git-bisect:
  ee404566f97f9254433399fbbcfa05390c7c55f7
is 'bad' according to testing, but that's 'another' badness - and i 
missed it.
Now, having slept on it, the solution is very simple: whenever 
git-bisect picks a commit for which the following command comes up 
empty:
  git-log | grep f3ccb06f3b8e0cf42b579db21f3ca7f17fcc3f38
then i'll mark it "git-bisect good" - artificially marking the older 
badness as a 'good' area. That way git-bisect will find the right 
good->bad transition point.
btw., that's why i tried to pick up commits by hand, making sure that 
commit f3ccb06f3b8e0cf42b579db21f3ca7f17fcc3f38 is always included - but 
got lost in the maze of the commit graph, and didnt realize that there 
is a simple solution. Nevertheless i wanted to dump the information i 
already gathered. Those commits were totally out of order, etc. - they 
were picked by a poor human who is much worse at walking graphs than 
git-bisect ;-)
