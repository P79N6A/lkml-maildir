Hello,
Where in the src tree can I find (or what is) the command to generate a
patch file from two Linux kernel src trees, one being the original and the
other being the newly changed one??
I've tried 'diff -ruN', but that does diff's on several files that could
stay out of the comparison (such as the files in include/config, .files,
etc.).
Thanks in advance for your help.
Later,
Ivan
