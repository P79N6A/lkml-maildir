u64 and uint64_t should be identical?

I don't get it.  Are u64 and uint64_t different on any arch?

The mismatch which I've seen triggering a lot is doing do_div() on an s64
when it expects a u64.
And I think that _is_ a bug, isn't it?  do_div(-10, 10) should return -1,
but as the implementation will convert -10 to <monstrously large +ve
number>, the return value will be wildly wrong?
I'm thinking that the problem here is that x86's do_div(s64, ...) doesn't
warn.  So people write wrong code and then the problems only crop up on
architectures which use asm-generic/div64.h, which does warn?
