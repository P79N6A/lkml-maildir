MMC-5 rev 4 section 7.1:
"Some commands that may be implemented by MM drives are
not described in this standard, but are found in other
SCSI standards. For a complete list of these commands
refer to [SPC-3]."
Hmm, "may be implemented" yet REPORT LUNS is mandatory
in SPC-3 (and SPC-3 is a normative reference for MMC-5).
I guess there is wriggle room there.
In practice, MMC diverges from SPC a lot more than other
SCSI device type command sets (e.g. SBC and SSC).

There is also SAT compliance. For the ATA command set (i.e.
disks) sat-r09 lists REPORT LUNS and refers to SPC-3. For
ATAPI sat-r09 is far less clear. It does recommend, for
example, that the ATA Information VPD pages is implemented
in the SATL for ATAPI devices.
