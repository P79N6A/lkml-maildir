You do not need to be detective to spot this. *Dangerous* changes was announced
quite loudly.

Do not ask. If you think that just few functions was changed/renamed then
you are not wrong. You are VERY wrong. Carefull review of FAT needed needed

there at all anymore so there are no easy replacement for update_vm_cache
function.
