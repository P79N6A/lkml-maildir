You are probably right. What  I want is generic tty-over-netdevice
layer. And it may not be such a good idea for multipoint networks.
 OTOH, radiomodems _are_ multipoint still they look like tty => you can
put drivers into userspace.

As long as multipoint is done in software (does irda do it this way)
like in radiomodems, and not in hardware like ethernet cards, putting
IrDAv2 over TTY will be ok.

1:0.
It is simple.  It is so that I could take work of people doing
radiomodems (scarab), and use it with FIR devices to gain multipoint
4MBPS connections ;-). It's true that going to userland at speeds
~4MBPS may not be such a good idea... And it is so that I could try to
develop my own IP-over-infrared encapsulation, and do it completely in
userspace, and _still_ have it working with 4Mbit FIR devices.
