i now have x86 allyesconfig numbers too:
    text     data     bss      dec  filename
 24190215 6737902 1775592 32703709  vmlinux-allyes-speed-orig
 20096423 6758758 1775592 28630773  vmlinux-allyes-orig
 19223511 6844002 1775656 27843169  vmlinux-allyes-inline+units+fixes+capable
i.e. enabling CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE gives a 20.4% size reduction, 
and adding my latest debloating-queue ontop of gives an additional 4.5% 
of reduction. The queue is at:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/debloating-patches/
note: my focus is still mostly on CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE (which is only 
offered if CONFIG_EMBEDDED is enabled) - if you want a larger kernel 
optimized for speed, do not enable it.
