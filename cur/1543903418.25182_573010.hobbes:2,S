Subject: from where comes "__moddi3"?

  again, probably displaying my abject ignorance, but i wrote a
trivial module that tries to "var % 15", and i get:
  WARNING: "__moddi3" undefined!
and, not surprisingly, when i try to insmod:
  insmod: error inserting 'seq.ko': -1 Unknown symbol in module
(using 16 rather than 15 works fine, as i assume that the modulus
call is simply replaced by an optimized  bitwise comparison.)
  so ... from where comes __moddi3?  i know there are places in the
kernel source tree that do non-power-of-2 moduli, and they work fine,
no?  thanks.
