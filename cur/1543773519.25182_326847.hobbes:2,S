Good news!
the latest 2.6.12 actually works properly. when i load the device driver 
the regions are no longer disabled and both gpus work correctly. I'm 
still a little confused as to why the first value for the BARs seem 
nonsensical...
It looks like 2.6.12 is able to relocate the BAR regions for the GPUs 
(see dump below)..
