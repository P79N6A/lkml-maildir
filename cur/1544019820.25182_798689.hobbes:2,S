 While I can't judge on what's convenient to you, I do not feel
 fine in having a kernel option to disable the rtc and another to load
 a specific i2c one.
 However, if there's a strong consensus from other people
 on the matter, I will close an eye and pretend I haven't seen
 the patch slipping thru :)
