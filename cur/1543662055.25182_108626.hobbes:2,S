So are the functions registered on the reboot notifier path guaranteed
to be non-blocking?  In the kexec on panic case, calls that can block
would obviously be a bad thing.  If they can block, perhaps we could add
a new flag SYS_PANIC or something like that to tell the driver to only
do a non-blocking shutdown of the chip.

The problem we were seeing was that rogue DMA from a network interface
chip was corrupting dentry's in the dirent cache when the rebooted
kernel was coming back up.  This caused a whole new set of panics. :-(
