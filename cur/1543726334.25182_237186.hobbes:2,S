Subject: [BUG] PPC math-emu multiply problem

I'm seeing what appears to be a bug in the ppc kernel trap math 
emulator. An extreme case for multiplies isn't working the way gcc 
soft-float or hardware floating point is. The value in mindble is the 
smallest that can be represented in a double. When we try to divide it 
by two we should see an underflow and a return value of 0. We see this 
when using soft-float in gcc, or when there is HW floating point 
support, but it fails when the kernel trap emulator is used.
If anyone can verify this on a PPC other than an 8560 without hardware 
floating point I'd appreciate it. I did all of these tests with a 2.6.X 
based kernels. The x86 was 2.6.6 vanilla, 8560 is 2.6.6 with lots of 
stuff added and support for 8560. The 8260 was 2.6.0 with changes. I 
bumped into this with the LSB ldexp test. A simple multiply shows the 
problem though.
