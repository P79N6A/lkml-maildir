Hi Ingo,

The simplest way to do a basic sanity check is build the kprobes samples/
and try them out. We have one sample each to test kprobes, kretprobes
and jprobes. This should serve the purpose.
I had posted patches for the same sometime back
(
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=119297044801420&w=2
), but they needed
some rework to fix a build break on sparc64
(
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=119735423212298&w=2
).
I will rebase the patchset against the latest mm and repost soon...
