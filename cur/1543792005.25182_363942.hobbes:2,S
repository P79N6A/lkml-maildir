I didn't know that this was a possibility and, as a luser, I would love
to have this functionality as I frequently need to use HFS+ filesystems
with Linux.
Perhaps, with big, fat warnings in the configure help (defaulting for
the safest thing) it could be an option, while we don't have the journal
replay that Roman mentioned.
