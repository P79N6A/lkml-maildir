Sounds like we have quite a few of those weird ones!
The real question is whats the working set for mapped dma handles for such
a controller. They would typically allocate only a few to what the controller
could handle, and would submit when the io completes right.. So typically
we shouldnt have any trouble since they would be able to reclaim what they
freed before submission (for iova).
Having a IOVA requirement in 2g etc is not a problem, except how many devices
on the same pci bus and what the total working set for iova is for that config.
The only way to gaurantee would be for the device to ask for a gauranteed set
maybe during pci_set_dma_mask() or some such time, and pre-reserve some
IOVA to gaurantee we never run out. BUt this is again driver changes and 
wont be fair if some driver is greedy.
