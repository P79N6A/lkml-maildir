I can think of a couple of ways, but thanks for confirming
I properly guessed how the openat emulation was working.
The first point to note is that fixing proc and exporting
syscalls to new architectures is going to take about equally
long with a chance that fixing proc will take longer because
that needs to be understood.
With that said I can think of a couple of different ways
to implement openat that won't have proc permission problems.
The most straight forward is:
int openat(int dirfd, const char *path, int flags, int mode)
{
        int orig_dir_fd;
        int result;
	lock()
	orig_dir_fd = open(".");
	fchdir(dirfd);
        result = open(relpath);
        fchdir(orig_dir_fd);
        close(orig_dir_fd);
        unlock();
        return result;
}
I suspect something like the above needs to be considered if
you want the emulation to work on old kernels, in the presence
of suid applications.
I will look at fixing proc but I none of my work on /proc
is going to get merged until 2.6.18 at this point.
I doubt a proc permission change could count as a simply
a bug fix, and even then it doesn't matter because it won't
be available for your emulation.
Although I guess you could attempt to use /proc/self/fd/<n>
and if that gets a permission problem try a slower but more
reliable path in the emulation.
