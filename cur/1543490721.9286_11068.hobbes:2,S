Hi,
I'm trying to hack sound volume control for the leadtek WinView TV/FM.
I now have just about everything sorted out, except the sound volume.
I know that the volume is programmed serially on a three wire interface
using a chip marked PT2254A the logo is the letters PTC inside a balloon.
I can't find any reference to this chip, I believe it is a two channel
serially programmed volume control. But I haven't been able to guess the
programming protocol, I can change the volume, but the same byte sequence
never works twice!
If anyone can help me locate the makers or a datasheet for this chip I would
very much appreciate it.
Thanks
Jon
