Here is the patch for AIO retry to hold an extra ref count.  The patch is
small, but I wanted to make sure it was safe.
I spent time looking over the retry code and this patch looks ok to me.  It
is potentially calling put_ioctx() while holding ctx->ctx_lock, I do not
think that will cause any problems.  This should never be the last reference
on the ioctx anyway, since the loop is checking list_empty(&ctx->run_list). 
The first ref is taken in sys_io_setup() and last removed in io_destroy(). 
It also looks like holding ctx->ctx_lock prevents any races between any
retries and an io_destroy() which would try to cancel all iocbs.
I've tested this on my 2-proc by coping a raw partitions and copying ext3
files using using AIO and O_DIRECT, O_SYNC, and both.
