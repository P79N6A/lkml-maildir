you mean the fs corruption on soft raid or the interupts problem ?
i dumped the raid setup as i couldn't find a way to debug it
and my drives are pretty full again, but i'll try to free some space
for the interupts 
with test7-bk8  , acpi=off pci=noacpi &
hdparm  -m0 -d1 -X69  /dev/hd[a,e,g]
hdparm  -m16 -d1 -X69  /dev/hd[a,e,g]
i don't see timeouts
if i omit -m i do see them sometimes
(i see them both with -m and without -m if i try to use TCQ )
for testing copied several 6-10Gb directories &
dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/tmp/1/10Gb.zeros bs=512k count=21000
or
dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/tmp/1/10Gb.zeros bs=1024k count=10000
