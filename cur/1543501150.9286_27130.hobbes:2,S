We use one Linux system as a gateway between NT(SMB)
and Sun Solaris(NFS) systems. Today I experienced a
problem with the NFS client. The load on the systems
keept rising and I got this error message:
Jun 30 11:33:39 nfssmb1 kernel: nfs: task 31308 can't
get a request slot
Jun 30 11:34:15 nfssmb1 last message repeated 3 times

get a request slot
Jun 30 11:35:27 nfssmb1 kernel: nfs: task 31308 can't
get a request slot
The messages kept going on till I rebooted.
Is this a known problem only for NFSv3 or will I
experience the same problem with 2.2.10(NFSv2)?
Thanks for any informations.
