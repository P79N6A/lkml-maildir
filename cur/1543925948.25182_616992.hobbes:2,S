Do you know how this Tivoli package works or where it gets the
information?

I think you are assuming userspace can just dump the raw ACPI tables
and extract this information from them.  But I don't think that's
possible because _SUN is a method that can contain arbitrary AML.
That AML has to be *executed*, and you can't do that safely in
userspace.
