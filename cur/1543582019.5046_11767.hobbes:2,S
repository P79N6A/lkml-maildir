No.  I'm not talking about stack-guard patches.  I'm talking about bounds checking.
The difference here is that if correct code is generated you won't
overflow any buffer at all period.  The compiler will either prove at
compile time that it can't happen (The efficient case).  Or it will
generate pointers as <start,length,offset> tuples into chunks of
memory.  And it will do runtime checks that will that will kill your
program if it overflows the stack.  I think the gcc options is -fcheck
or something like that.  I haven't had a chance to follow up, since I
saw that someone was actually working on it.
Since compilers bugs happen buffer overflow exploits are still
possible but it means two separate programmers must mess up in
complimentary ways.
As for fine grain privileges they can help, but the real fix is to
keep the programs that need raised privileges down to one function.
Letting you look at the program and see if it is obviously correct
with no security bugs. 
But the gcc bounds checking work is the ultimate buffer overflow fix.
You can recompile all of your trusted applications, and libraries with
it and be safe from one source of bugs.
