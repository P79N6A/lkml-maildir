The series of patches I just posted addresses locking.  Lockdep helped me
find and fix a number of locking problems (deadlocks and races).  I tried
the fixes w/ my unionfs-specific regression suite (on top of many different
filesystems), with ltp on top of ext3 or tmpfs, and with a large "make -j"
kernel compile on top of ext3 or tmpfs.  I also tried it with machines with
more/less memory, SMP/UMP, and/or while forcing drop_caches.
I also found and reported a lockdep problem in nfs4 and ext3.  I also
re-discovered a long-standing lockdep problem in jffs2 (which I reported a
while back, but it still exists).

The series of patches I just posted fixes these.  Basically, we weren't
releasing the lower inodes early enough, in several scenarios.  So they hung
around until the f/s unmounted.  To test the fixes, I've run each of the 707
LTP "syscalls" tests, and each of the 54 "fs" tests, and compared the number
of inodes and blocks used in the upper and lower file systems before and
after each test.  And I've tested it with LTP running in a union on top of
ext3 or tmpfs.  I'm happy to report we don't leak a single inode now.

I've tried all of these on linus's latest tree.  Since Andrew reported that
x86 is broken in -mm, I wasn't yet able to try it with mm or with your tmpfs
patches.
Cheers,
Erez.
