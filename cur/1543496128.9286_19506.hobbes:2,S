 =>My dual celeron 300As @ 450 MHz (2.2.9) running your program gives:

 =>Mon May 17 18:05:40 1999: fwd:774496/0:back max 0000000
 =>Mon May 17 18:05:41 1999: fwd:913473/0:back max 0000000
That's what I expect, but what I get is:
Mon May 17 18:57:17 1999: fwd:362637/4:back max 0000003
Mon May 17 18:57:18 1999: fwd:866801/9:back max 0000003
Mon May 17 18:57:19 1999: fwd:873531/7:back max 0000004
Mon May 17 18:57:20 1999: fwd:872292/8:back max 0000003
Mon May 17 18:57:21 1999: fwd:873949/9:back max 0000003
with max [i.e. maximum clock decrement detected] going up to
5000-10000 (5-10ms) when I'm writing a CD or scrolling a Netscape
window.
Somebody else also reported success with a Dell SMP box running 2.2.9,
so I compiled a copy for myself, but it didn't make any difference
from 2.2.7.
 =>Another thing..Perhaps try enabling "MTRR" in the kernel if it's not
 =>already to synchronize TSCs at bootup.  I'm not sure if MTRR does this or 
 =>not, actually, so maybe try flashing a new BIOS if all else fails.  I know
 =>some BIOSes don't synchronize the TSCs properly, and this would confuse
 =>gettimeofday()...
I'm using MTRR, but that code doesn't mention the TSC.  My box is an
Intel N440BX motherboard with the latest BIOS; what are your Celerons
on?
Thanks for trying the program!
