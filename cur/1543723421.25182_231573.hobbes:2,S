Sorry, since it was obvious that if the user sets TF in userspace, he 
won't see the instruction following the int80, I thought you meant the 
interaction between userspace-TF and ptrace. That's documented in x86 
manuals and I don't think we should even try to have the userspace-TF to 
have a different behaviour from what x86 describe.

Here I meant that if you set SINGLESTEP|SYSGOOD, the patch will give you 
SIGTRAP|0x80, while if you set only SINGLESTEP the patch will give you 
SIGTRAP. Enforcing the SINGLESTEP|SYSGOOD is invalid or only gives SIGTRAP 
should be no more that three lines of code out of the fast path.
