I'm a bit confused here.  I have a custom kernel configuration, and
I've trimmed out most of the multimedia aspects sound/video/etc
because this is for a server machine.  I was just recompiling, and I
noticed there was still some media stuff compiling:
 LD      drivers/input/serio/built-in.o
  LD      drivers/media/common/built-in.o
  LD      drivers/media/dvb/b2c2/built-in.o
  LD      drivers/media/dvb/bt8xx/built-in.o
  LD      drivers/media/dvb/cinergyT2/built-in.o
  LD      drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core/built-in.o
  LD      drivers/media/dvb/dvb-usb/built-in.o
  LD      drivers/media/dvb/frontends/built-in.o
  LD      drivers/media/dvb/pluto2/built-in.o
  LD      drivers/media/dvb/ttpci/built-in.o
  LD      drivers/media/dvb/ttusb-budget/built-in.o
  LD      drivers/media/dvb/ttusb-dec/built-in.o
  LD      drivers/media/dvb/built-in.o
  LD      drivers/media/radio/built-in.o
  LD      drivers/media/video/built-in.o
  LD      drivers/media/built-in.o
  LD      drivers/misc/built-in.o
  CC      drivers/net/Space.o
This confuses me, because as I said, I'm not including multimedia in
the kernel.  I checked the config and I see the following:
#
# Multimedia devices
#
# CONFIG_VIDEO_DEV is not set
#
# Digital Video Broadcasting Devices
#
# CONFIG_DVB is not set
Which is what I would expect.  So why are these things compiling into
the kernel even if they're not selected? Or am I missing something
about the process?  Kernel 2.6.13.3 here.  Thanks.
