What distribution of linux do you use? I have the same problem 
using SuSE 6.1 and i guess the error is somewhere in the 
shutdown process (just guessing). I have a FIC VL-601 mainboard 
and i am using the SuSE kernel 2.2.5, the developer kernel 2.3.6 
and the ac version 2.3.5ac1. Since it does't work in either of them, i 
don't guess it's a kernel problem. Somebody would have noticed.
But i haven't contacted the folks at SuSE yet, amybe after this is 
resolved...
