I'm not sure on that one - it definitely can't give the effect in question
(opposite direction), but I suspect that file->f_op can't be NULL at all.
Dunno, I'll look at it.

	Yes, but it would give instant OOPS and it was not the case.
Besides, it should not happen (read: if it happens we are screwed
somewhere else. Big way).

It's nothing but a gut feeling, but I suspect that we either have fput()
called outside of big lock (and thus SMP races) or net/socket.c playing
rough. I'll look at it ~6 hours later - right now I'm going down ;-/
