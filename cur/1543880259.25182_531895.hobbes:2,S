On the basis that there's only anecdotal evidence thus far that
fairness is the right approach.
It's not yet clear that a fair scheduler can do the right thing with X,
with various kernel threads, etc. without fiddling with nice levels.
Which makes it no longer "completely fair".
It's also not yet clear that a scheduler can't be taught to do the
right thing with X without fiddling with nice levels.
So I'm just not yet willing to completely rule out systems that aren't
"completely fair".
But I think we should rule out schedulers that don't have rigid bounds on
that unfairness. That's where the really ugly behavior lies.
