    Here I have many VIA chipset PC's, and all of them show the same
problem: the SPP and EPP modes are detected (but only if I give the
proper options, otherwise only SPP works), and ECP is not detected.
The problem is longer to explain properly, but that's more or less.
    I cannot help you (by now...), but I'm trying to isolate and
solve my problem with the help of Dino Klein, and as soon as I have
something, I can contact you.
    Anyway, your card seems to be 'moded' through software, am I
wrong?, so maybe it should work providing in the module options the
io_hi value for the card, so the ECR registers are accessed and you
get ECP. Devices connected to the port shouldn't (IMHO) set the mode
on the port...
