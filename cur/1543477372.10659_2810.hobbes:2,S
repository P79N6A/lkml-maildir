The kernel filesystem code doesn't care where a filesystem is.
If you have something on hda2 and move the whole works of it to
/dev/hdj24, it is still an ext2 filesystem (assuming that hdj24
was properly formatted with mke2fs).  You need to be careful
moving the files over however and ensure that permissions,
ownership, etc do not change.
The only thing that changes when a filesystem moves from
partition to partition is the way you mount it.  So if your
/etc/fstab says to mount /usr from /dev/hda2, and you move that
data from /dev/hda2 to dev/hdj24 then you need to change fstab to
mount /usr from /dev/hdj24.

An "fdisk -l" screenshot would be more descriptive.  You can use
the mouse to cut and paste the output of that command into your
email.

2 unused partitions?  /dev/hda3 and /dev/hda5?  /dev/hda5 would
be the first partition inside the extended one.

I'm assuming that you're meaning you copied the raw partition

all primary/extended/logical partitions on your disk.

No problem.  You could have just changed it's partition id to
another type though, and then ran the proper filesystem creation
program on it.

/dev/hda4 is your extended partition.  When you undid it, you
opened up the space for partitioning for ALL of your extended
partitions and lost your extended partition table.

So you wanted the extended partition to START where /dev/hda6 was
instead of where your currently unused /dev/hda5 was?  That way
your original /dev/hda6 if unharmed by the process would become
now /dev/hda5?
In other words, "if I remove hda3, and move hda4's start point to
hda6, then my new hda3 can be bigger (the size of old hda3+hda5),
and my original hda6 now becomes the first partition in hda4.
Ok, now draw a chart down, of what all I said above (if you
didn't pass out reading it ;o) and go through it slow.  ;o)  I
think I follow your idea so far.

Assuming that you manually edited the raw partition table and
actually got everything correct, you should have booted from
floppy, then edited your lilo.conf and reinstalled lilo.  I'm not
even sure that the entire process discussed above is possible
without some sort of advanced filesystem remapper.

No, but you need to change your filesystem table so that mount
mounts everything in the right space.  That is the only thing I
can think that you possibly did wrong besides possibly LILO.  I
would think that your repartitioning should have worked.

Hmmm.  I personally would have done it with a 2.0.36 kernel to be
safe, but without further details of your system, etc.. it's hard
to say what exactly it could be.
