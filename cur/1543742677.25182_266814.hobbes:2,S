I don't see how having flush_to_ldisc() queued
or already running (on another processor) negates
the prohibition on calling tty_flip_buffer_push()
with low_latency set in interrupt context.
The comments for tty_flip_buffer_push() state the
function should not be called in interrupt context
if low_latency is set (no exceptions are listed).
Meaning flush_to_ldisc() should only be called
in process context.
If flush_to_ldisc() is queued or already executing,
there is no protection against calling
flush_to_ldisc() again, directly in interrupt context.
TTY_DONT_FLIP is no protection, that is only set
in read_chan() of n_tty.c
If I'm missing something, please point it out.
