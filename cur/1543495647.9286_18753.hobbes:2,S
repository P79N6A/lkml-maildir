Tempting, but... That Would Be Wrong(tm). Besides, it would make life
inconvenient for everybody, not only SplashSnotters.

<raised brows> Do you realize that 'lot gathered here' has some connection
to the kernel development? After all, it's what this list is about...
As for the "splashed everywhere" - does it occur to you that it's exactly
what makes your lot so disgusting? [Profound apologies for usage of 'your'
if you are not a SplashSnotter yourself, indeed] Slashdot is a noise
generator and it does its worst to create a bad name to every community it
happens to, erm, embrace. Small wonder that objects of their attention are
not amused...
