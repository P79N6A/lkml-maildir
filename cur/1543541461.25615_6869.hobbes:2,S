Exactly.
The Linux threads model does allow having separate "cwd"s per thread, but
many other threads models (ie pthreads) do not. So fd_open() would solve
the issue regardless of what the threading model in use is.

Both might as well be done with "fd_open" + fstat/fopendir (fopendir is a
purely user-mode thing). Maybe fd_lstat(), who knows..
