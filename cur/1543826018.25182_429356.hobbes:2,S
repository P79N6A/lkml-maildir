The problem is that with per-task caps, if I have a resource group A
and I want to limit it to 10%, I need to limit each task in resource
group A to 10% (which makes resource groups not so useful). Is my
understanding correct? Is there a way to distribute the group limit
across tasks in the resource group?

Could you please provide me with a link to the new improved statistics.
What do the new statistics contain - any heads up on them?
