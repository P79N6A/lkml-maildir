Ah, I did grovel through the source and come to that conclusion as well (I
wasn't thinking very clearly yesterday <g>)

It was an MTEOM command, and without the deadlock detection it just blocks for
ages (tens of minutes), with no tape drive activity; the problem seems to
manifest itself when it's executed right after an MTWEOF (which is a bit of a
silly thing to do, I know...). It's an HP Colorado 8Gb drive (i.e. 4Gb <g>) --
is it possible that it's a bug / feature in the drive firmware?
Apart from that, the driver seems to work great though..
Cheers,
Steve
