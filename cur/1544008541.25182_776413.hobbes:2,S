2.6.27-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: David Brownell <dbrownell@users.sourceforge.net>
commit 9c264521a9f836541c122b00f505cfd60cc5bbb5 upstream.
Somewhere in the conversion of the RNDIS gadget code to the new
framework, the descriptor of its data interface seems to have
been copied from the CDC Ethernet driver.  Unfortunately that
means it got a nonzero altsetting ... which is incorrect.  Issue
uncovered by Richard Röjfors <richard.rojfors@endian.se>.
This patch fixes that problem, and resolves at least some cases
of Windows XP bluescreening itself.
Tested-by: Richard Röjfors <richard.rojfors@endian.se>.
