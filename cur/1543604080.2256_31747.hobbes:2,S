Hi!
 > Could I try to patch also 2.4.10 kernel?
You can do this 'by hand'. 2.4.10 changed the structure a bit. But I sent
VDA a modified patch some time ago. Maybe just ask him.
 > This patch will be included in kernel 2.4.11?
I don't think so. :(
Honestly I'm not happy about this, but there had beed a large discussion
about it. There were some people which mobo worked right 'out of the box',
and they found that others should patch their kernels by hand to be able
to use their linux boxes. :(((

ps: I use this patch too on an ABIT KT7A mobo with Duron 750
