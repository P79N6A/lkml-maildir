It's important to remember that the benchmarks that caused the
soul-searching were rather unrealistic, flat-file-only benchmarks.
Most big web servers serve dynamic content, for those benchmarks
were meaningless.
If you're asking what one would do to maximize performance on
those benchmarks using Apache and Linux, I'd say use kernel 2.2.13
and try the SGI Apache performance patches (see 
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/apache/
 ).
When they come out, kernel 2.4 and phhttpd will be very much worth trying, 
too.
(khttpd hasn't yet been shown to be faster than phhttpd, imho.)
