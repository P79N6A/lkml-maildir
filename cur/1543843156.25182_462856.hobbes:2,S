Generally it looks good - two comments:
- I see some advantages to having biohead_orig to avoid keeping track of
  it and passing it around, but there's also good reasons for _not_
  adding more stuff to struct request. Any particular reason you chose
  to do that?
- blk_get_bounced_bio() looks redundant. BIO_BOUNCED should only be set
  on a bounced bio, and ->bi_private should always hold that bounced
  bio.
