Sadly, you weren't smoking something, and it's not OK.  As akpm
pointed out later, the lru_lock dependecy is via __free_pages() which
is called from update_and_free_page() with hugetlb_lock held.

i_size is already used for a hard limit on the file size - faulting a
page beyond i_size will SIGBUS, whereas faulting a page beyond
i_blocks just isn't guaranteed.  In particular, we always extend
i_size when makiing a new mapping, whereas we only extend i_blocks
(and thus reserve pages) on a SHARED mapping (because space is being
guaranteed for things in the mapping, not for a random processes
MAP_PRIVATE copy).
