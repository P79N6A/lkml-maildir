Subject: [PATCH] [GFS2] Fail over to readpage for stuffed files
This is partially derrived from a patch written by Russell Cattelan.
It fixes a bug where there is a race between readpages and truncate
by ignoring readpages for stuffed files. This is ok because a stuffed
file will never be more than one block (minus sizeof(struct gfs2_dinode))
in size and block size is always less than page size, so we do not lose
anything efficiency-wise by not doing readahead for stuffed files. They
will have already been "read ahead" by the action of reading the inode
in, in the first place.
This is the remaining part of the fix for Red Hat bugzilla #218966
which had not yet made it upstream.
