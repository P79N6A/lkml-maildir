sorry, i don't understand the question.  i'm just running "make" on a
simple module i wrote, using the prototypical in-directory makefile to
build out-of-tree.
the first four lines of my module source file are:
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/init.h>
#include <asm/termbits.h>               /* Shouldn't be necessary */
#include <linux/tty_driver.h>           /* For struct tty_driver */
  if i omit the inclusion of the termbits.h header, i get the
aforementioned error.  beyond that, i'm unclear on what you're asking.
