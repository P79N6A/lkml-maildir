Subject: [PATCH] Make hot unplugging of PCI buses work

Hi,
Linus - this patch is for discussion, NOT for applying unless you have
zero problems with it since it actively breaks existing hotplug PCI.
PCI Split-bridge "docking station".  It's basically a PCI bus with VGA,
serial, keyboard, mouse, parport in a box, connected to a cardbus card.
Other models include a PC-type case with PCI slots connected to a
cardbus card.
To put it another way, hotplug PCI bus.  In my case, I have the following
bus structure:
---[00]-+-00.0  Digital Equipment Corporation StrongARM DC21285
        +-01.0  Cirrus Logic PD 6833 PCMCIA/CardBus Ctrlr
           \-[01]---00.0  MOBILITY Electronics: Unknown device 0120
                     \-[02]--+-00.0  MOBILITY Electronics: Unknown device 0121
                             +-00.1  MOBILITY Electronics: Unknown device 0122
                             +-00.2  MOBILITY Electronics: Unknown device 0123
                             +-00.3  MOBILITY Electronics: Unknown device 0124
                             +-04.0  ATI Technologies Inc Rage XL
                             +-08.0  Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8139
                             \-0c.0  OPTi Inc. 82C861
        +-01.1  Cirrus Logic PD 6833 PCMCIA/CardBus Ctrlr
        +-02.0  OPTi Inc. 82C861
        \-03.0  Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] 79c978 [HomePNA]
And without the device plugged in:
---[00]-+-00.0  Digital Equipment Corporation StrongARM DC21285
        +-01.0  Cirrus Logic PD 6833 PCMCIA/CardBus Ctrlr
        +-01.1  Cirrus Logic PD 6833 PCMCIA/CardBus Ctrlr
        +-02.0  OPTi Inc. 82C861
        \-03.0  Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] 79c978 [HomePNA]
Currently, we do not have a way to tell the PCI subsystem "this device
has gone, as have all its children" without manually walking the device
tree.  I suspect real docking stations will require this same
functionality.
The following patch adds support for this to the PCI layer - there are
two entry points:
- pci_remove_bus_device(dev)
  This removes one device from its parent bus, and any children.
- pci_remove_all_bus_devices(bus)
  This removes all devices from a bus, including any children.
The Cardbus layer will use pci_remove_all_bus_devices() when a cardbus
card is removed.  The drivers do not have an option whether to obey the
removal request or not - you've yanked the cardbus device from the
socket and the devices are gone.
pci_remove_bus_device() is intended where you have a set of hot-
pluggable devices on a bus and you can remove them individually.  It
is intended that the existing hotplug layer should use this if they
need to handle power issues associated with each PCI device socket
individually on their hotplugging bus(es).
Furthermore, I propose that pci_remove_device() shall disappear -
and this devices makes it so (thereby breaking existing hotplug
drivers.)
This patch does not contain any of the other changes to allow Linux
to deal with PCI buses hanging off a cardbus card.
