Fair enough. I pointed it out to make clear that there are licensing 
problems and ambiguities if one strictly insists that #include 
some_gpl.h implies that the code is GPL'd. If that is the case, then 
there are MUCH bigger licensing problems than LSM, so don't take it up 
with me, either :-)

However, it is an outright contradiction to some wishes of some other 
copyright holders of the kernel (Linus' binary kernel opinion). Since 
revisions to the kernel's GPL are explicitly prohibited, it seems to me 
that this statement of one side of the controversy as if it were a fact 
increases confusion rather than decreases it.

Fair enough.  How about this:
    "This file is GPL. See the Linux Kernel's COPYING file for details.
    There is controversy over whether this permits you to write a module
    that #includes this file without placing your module under the GPL.
    Consult your lawyer for advice."
I'm really trying to be constructive here.  There is a real licensing 
problem over whether binary modules are legitimate at all, and the issue 
is not special to LSM. I'm trying to get LSM out of the way so that the 
advocates of either side can fight it out without smushing LSM in the 
middle :-)
