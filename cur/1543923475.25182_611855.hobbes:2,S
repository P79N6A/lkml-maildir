Subject: [PATCH 2/3] Deadline iosched: Reset batch for ordered requests
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/30/4

The deadline I/O scheduler does not reset the batch count when starting
a new batch at a higher-sectored request.  This means the second and
subsequent batch in the same data direction will never exceed a single
request in size whenever higher-sectored requests are pending.
This patch gives new batches in the same data direction as old ones
their full quota of requests by resetting the batch count.
