Only in "Blackhat" mode.  I ran in Kiddie and Blackhat mode, and my
second batch of tests (tests.txt, my errata) was run after execstack -c.

old_mmap(NULL, 64996, PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC, MAP_PRIVATE, 3, 0) = 0x265d9000
old_mmap(NULL, 1232332, PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC, MAP_PRIVATE, 3, 0) = 0x265e9000
mmap2(NULL, 8392704, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC,
MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x26716000
I killed the fork() line and straced it.
0x26716000 is only ~600 megs up,  I find my stack at ~1.5G under
segmexec, I'd guess it'd be at ~3G under normal things like execshield.
 You know what *looks*
getstack1:  0xfefcead7
getstack1:  0xfefe9947
getstack1:  0xfeedd4f7
getstack1:  0xfefe6e37
getstack1:  0xfee412b7
getstack1:  0xfee71737
Yeah it's pretty high under exec shield.
none of these are doing ANYTHING weird (grepping for EXEC and scanning
for PROT_EXEC and related addresses), aside from the normal mapping of
libraries by the system, which is probably what's killing Exec Shield's
anonymous mapping, heap, data, bss, library data, library bss. . .
To put it bluntly, you're wrong.  The tests are valid.
