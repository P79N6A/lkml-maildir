You can choose the licence under which you distribute the code.
It's obvious that everyone else receiving the dual licenced code still 
can choose for himself.

authors.  Alan asks "So whats the problem ?".  Well, Alan, I must
caution you -- your post is advising people to break the law.

Theo claims quite clearly that removing the BSD licence notice when 
modifying BSD/GPL dual licenced code would break the law.
