Subject: USB_SUSPEND needs SUSPEND?

Hello,
it seems that there is some dependency missing for CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND.
When I compile a kernel without CONFIG_SUSPEND, USB suspend doesn't work
(or at least doesn't expose its interface to userspace).
/sys/bus/usb/devices/.../power doesn't exist, but it is there when I
enable CONFIG_SUSPEND. So should CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND depend on
CONFIG_SUSPEND (or something selected by CONFIG_SUSPEND)?
diff between the two configs follows, full config and dmesg for both
kernels is available at 
http://stud4.tuwien.ac.at/~e0626486/usb_suspend/
(though the dmesg diff doesn't seem to be all that interesting).
