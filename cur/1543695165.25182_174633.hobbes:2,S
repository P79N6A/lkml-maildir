Using LBD.

It means 'approximately'. To be more precise, there were 24 nodes copying 
data to and from the partition via NFS.

I can simply reproduce it - the only thing needed is to nfsmount this
partition from clients and start writing a file to it, as I've written
before. The crash occurs immediately after the transfer begins.
As I've said, I wouldn't blame HW failure or things like this, because 
ext3 does the job flawlessly, as far as I can see.
