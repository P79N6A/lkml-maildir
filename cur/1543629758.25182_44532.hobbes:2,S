I think about an hour or so ago, Tom Duffy posted some fixes to the
Sparclinux mailing list that may help you out.  I cc'd them here.  They may
help you out, I havn't looked at them yet, so YMMV.

here is the sparc64 kbuild against core-11 and 2.5.14
you must apply the linux-2.5.14-sparc64-hacks.patch first to get sparc64
to build on 2.5.14 (even using kbuild 2.4)
0) untar linux-2.5.14.tar.bz2
1) apply linux-2.5.14-sparc64-hacks.patch
2) apply kbuild-2.5-core-11
3) apply kbuild-2.5-common-2.5.14-1
4) apply kbuild-2.5-sparc64-2.5.14-1
you should be good to go...
this patch still needs work on the asm-offsets to get it work The Right
Way (tm)
