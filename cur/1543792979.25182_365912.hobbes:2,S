Is there some quick hack I can do in kernel to unlock it? Is it
possible to accidentally unlock "BIOS" area and brick the device?

Good news is that I do have /dev/mtdX. Bad news is I do not have
flash_unlock. Does anyone have binary suitable for arm, preferably
statically linked?

Ok, good. Read-only access is certainly better than nothing, and might
even be enough. Sharp shipped it with flash read-only originally.
