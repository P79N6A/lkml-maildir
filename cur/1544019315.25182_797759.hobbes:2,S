If the stats are only manipulated in one context, than an atomic requirement is overkill (and expensive on non-x86).

This is more like Christoph's CPU_OPS: they were special operators on normal per-cpu vars/ptrs.  Generic version was irqsave+op+irqrestore.
I actually like this idea, but Mathieu insists that the ops be NMI-safe, for ftrace.  Hence local_t needing to be atomic_t for generic code.
AFAICT we'll need a hybrid: HAVE_NMISAFE_CPUOPS, and if not, use atomic_t
in ftrace (which isn't NMI safe on parisc or sparc/32 anyway, but I don't think we care).
Other than the shouting, I liked Christoph's system:
- CPU_INC = always safe (eg. local_irq_save/per_cpu(i)++/local_irq_restore)
- _CPU_INC = not safe against interrupts (eg. get_cpu/per_cpu(i)++/put_cpu)
- __CPU_INC = not safe against anything (eg. per_cpu(i)++)
I prefer the name 'local' to the name 'cpu', but I'm not hugely fussed.

No, that will be "do generic stuff", since it's a link-time constant.  I don't know that this is a huge worry, to be honest.  We can leave the __ia64_per_cpu_var for their arch-specific code (I feel the same way about x86 to be honest).

Ah, I did not realize that you celebrated Australia day :)
