Well it's now documented although you have to search a web-site to
find it. Basically, it runs the CPU at low clock-speed when it's
busy-waiting. Since most all spin-locks lock for mere microseconds
it's unlikely that it does anything useful, but it can't hurt.

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
