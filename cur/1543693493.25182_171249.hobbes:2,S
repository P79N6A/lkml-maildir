Though I suspect it's gotten worse since 2.4.14 or so, where
we moved the final lru_cache_del() into __free_pages_ok() and
the fact that anonymous pages are on the lru lists.
It's quite possible that one CPU adds the page to the swap
cache, while another CPU moves the page around on the inactive
list. At that point both CPUs could be fiddling around with
the page->flags simultaneously.
In fact, this has been observed in heavy stress testing by
Matt Domsch and Robert Hentosh...
