In any case, the real important note here is that the two are pretty  
different concepts, ones that lend themselves to _very_ different  
optimizations, that are currently lumped together.  The very fact  
that some developers easily get them confused says that we need a  
good clean implementation of both distinct APIs with comparable  
documentation, including a bunch of good example usages.
Cheers,
