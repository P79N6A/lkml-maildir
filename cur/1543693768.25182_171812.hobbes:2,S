The BUG_ON at include/asm-generic/dma-mapping.h:19 is a
bug in that "generic DMA" code ... and I've seen the
same BUG reported from PPC folk too.
All implementations of dma_supported() should check
those DMA masks directly ... instead we have
  - A "generic" implementation that only works for PCI,
    even though that method (in particular!) was intended
    to really be generic enough to work with USB;
  - Some arch-specific implementations (x86) that don't
    handle the 64-bit DMA case correctly.
We might need arch-specific implementations of that
method, and maybe Alpha is even one of them.  But if
there's going to be a default implementation for that
method, the current scheme has portability problems.

Nope -- there's EHCI, which can handle 64-bit DMA when the
silicon allows ... which is why that test exists.
