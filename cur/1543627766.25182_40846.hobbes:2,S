On SPARC. M68k followed a bit later. But when I got my CHRP board, ext2 was
still big endian on (at least some) PPC boxes, so PPC must have been switched
over in 1997/1998.
I tried to find the exact date of the appearance of the `-s' option of e2fsck
in the changelog og e2fsprogs, but apparently not all changes are mentioned
there.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
