Hi,
I'm currently working on a syslog - kernel - glibc bug.
I have a question :
1) Does the kernel have anything to do with the syslog() calls ?? Or is it
entirely handled by glibc and the deamon ??
If the answer to the above is yes, then just disregards this email and I
appologize for the wasted bandwidth.
For those who are interested :
I'm working on patches so that a Linux system can entirely switch to the
UNIX98 PTY scheme. For thos who know Solaris : the /dev/pts/x devices.
I patches the following :
1)Telnetd
2)libproc
3)write
4)ps
and some other minor changes.
With syslog, the problem is that logging goed teriible wrong if the tty name
is a /dev/pts/x device.
Example :
Feb 26 17:22:49 jdi PAM_pwdb[5465]: (login) session opened for user dmitri
by (uid=0)
Feb 26 17:22:49 jdi  -- dmitri
              [5465]: LOGIN ON pts/1 BY dmitri FROM i
Feb 26 17:28:52 jdi PAM_pwdb[5465]: (login) session closed for user dmitri
The problem is the FROM part. Information passes to syslog() is good, I
checked... I just don't know who the blame for this bug, the kernel, the
glibc or syslog. I think it is either syslog() or glibc, and I think syslog.
I just want it confirmed.
Thanks for you time.
