sysctl has one *very* nice property that I would like people to keep:
one value per "file".  This gives a namespace all the way down to
individual data items, which is a *very* good idea.  Also, to be able to
read out all files which are +r for the user reading them and present a
user-readable display is very important (a few sysctl files don't do
this, and that's a serious bug.)
