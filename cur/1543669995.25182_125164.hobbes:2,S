Confirmed under vanilla 2.5.67 on a Dell C840.  It's chatty, and I'll
not comment on the neatness of implementation.  But... ;)
It now boots with the offending card, without it, insert it, eject it, I
haven't been able to confuse it (though I admit I havent tried a very fast
insert/eject cycle so the eject arrives before the insert finishes).  And yes,
the card in question was a multifunction (abbreviated lspci -vv output):
