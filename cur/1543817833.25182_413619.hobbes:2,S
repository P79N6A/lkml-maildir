Looks like the NoNewRefs flag is mostly == 
spin_is_locked(mapping->tree_lock)? Would it not be better to check the 
tree_lock?

A dream come true! If this is really working as it sounds then we can 
move the SetPageNoNewRefs up and avoid the final check under 
mapping->tree_lock. Then keep SetPageNoNewRefs until the page has been 
copied. It would basically play the same role as locking the page.
