i believe the original intent was to prevent anyone else from 
appending to either of the lists while the lists are being joined.
while it would be slightly less efficient, should it use the
skb primitives?  this is quite a bit easier to read:
void skb_migrate(struct sk_buff_head *from,struct sk_buff_head *to)
{
	struct sk_buff *skb;
	unsigned long flags;
	local_irq_save(flags);
	spin_lock(&to->lock);
	spin_lock(&from->lock);
	while(skb = __skb_dequeue(from))
		__skb_queue_tail(to, skb);
	spin_unlock(&to->lock);
	spin_unlock(&from->lock);
	local_irq_restore(flags);
}
