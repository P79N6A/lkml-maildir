But dealing with it in the eh_strategy_handler means that you may be
stopping all IO on the host instance as the first lun returns
EH_NOT_HANDLED for LUN based canceling.
I still think we can do better here for an LLDD that cannot execute a
cancel in interrupt context.
Having a error handler that works is a plus, I would hope that
some factoring would happen over time from the eh_strategy_handler to
some transport (or other factor point) error handler. I would think from a
testing, support, and block level multipath predictability sharing code
would be a good goal.
