uio_dummy.c (that should be present according documentation) seems 
missing.
I find the doc not very clear for the devices where there is no 
interrupt : they speak of some kernel timer, but a userspace timer could 
be used (and even the userspace driver could be written without kernel 
support at all).
At the end of the doc there is something about IRQ_HANDLED vs IRQ_NONE.
Last time I check kernel irq code, in both case next irq handler are 
called. The only difference was that if all handler reply IRQ_NONE, the 
kernel gave an error about an unexpected interrupt.
Also why sysfs is used for describing the mapping instead of something 
like an ioctl ?
UIO could be useful in embedded system where sysfs is not always 
desirable.
