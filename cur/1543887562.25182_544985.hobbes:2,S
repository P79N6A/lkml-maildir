Actually, this code was correct.  New inodes get written immediatly to
ensure catching -ENOSPC at a place where errors can get returned.  After
leaving this function, the inode is not dirty.  Either it has been
written or it is marked LOGFS_IF_STILLBORN never will be.
Your intuition was still good.  Link() did need the change you
indicated.
