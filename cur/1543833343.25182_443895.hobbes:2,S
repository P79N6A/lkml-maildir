More yup.

No, I don't see a way apart from inlining __cache_free(), or inlining
cache_free_alien() into both kfree() and kmem_cache_free(), both of which
are unattractive.
Well.  One could do
	local_irq_disable();
	cachep->array[smp_processor_id()]->lockdep_nested = 1;
	__cache_free(...)
	cachep->array[smp_processor_id()]->lockdep_nested = 0;
	local_irq_enable();
then do lots of ifdeffery to make that go away if !LOCKDEP.  But sheesh.
