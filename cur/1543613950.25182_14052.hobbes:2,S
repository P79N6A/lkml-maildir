Just find out... it is a problem of some settings in /etc directory 
it is not related to the FSes . I replaced the /etc directory with the
one we are using on the production machines... by the way. What can be
wrong? When it starts init , and execute the /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit , it
is hell slow. We have tried replace /sbin/init with bash and we got out
a shell but "ls -l" takes more than 2 minutes... do you know what sort
of settings in the /etc will affect use space "bash" or "glibc" on
nfsroot behaves different ? This is so strange.
Thanks
David
