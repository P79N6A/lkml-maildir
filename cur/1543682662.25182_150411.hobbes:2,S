ah ok, so at this stage swsuspending a X desktop doesn't work in general 
case, of course depending on video hardware? If X had some notion of 
suspend/resume things would be easier, than insisting every single 
driver save and restore all. After all the pci config space should be 
enough for kernel drivers?
