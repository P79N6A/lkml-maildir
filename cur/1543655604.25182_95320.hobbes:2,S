       Sincerely, I don't understand why this patch is bad. Is no worse
   than the previous situation :??
How about something like:
	if (len == 0)
		return addr;
	len = PAGE_ALIGN(len);
	if (len > TASK_SIZE || len == 0)
		return -EINVAL;
That should cover all cases and not make the TASK_SIZE assumption.
