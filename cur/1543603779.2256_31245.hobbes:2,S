Chris, 
Can you elaborate on "all over the place" by posting standard deviations 
of your measurements, or the entire sets? I guess you did about 6-10 of 
each. I think it's important since - who cares about good average 
performance if once in a while VM fails miserably. 
To emphasize the importance of this: I would expect that large deviations 
are more likely during short spikes of activity. It would be interesting 
to see how start-up times of mozilla vary having your linear swap 
test on the background. Too much to ask anyway.
Your conclusion about poor swapping with ac kernels is consistent with 
earlier posts ("VM: more numbers").
Alexei
