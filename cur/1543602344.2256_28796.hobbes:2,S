Rik,
 just did a short test with both 2.4.9-ac15 and 2.4.10 plain on a
Notebook with 320 MB and twice as much swap. "/" is on reiserfs.
 Both look a lot better that anything before. With my workload of
netscape, NT_under_vmware (128 MB memory) and a kernel compile I am not
using swap for the first time since in 2.4.x.
 My feeling is that 2.4.10 behaves a bit better with high I/O activity
on the reiserfs partition. Maybe this can be attributed to the latest
reiserfs stuff that went into 2.4.10, but not yet in -ac. The
responsiveness when "suspending" the vmware session has definitely
improved with 2.4.10. With 2.4.9-ac the system "freezes" for some
seconds during that operation.
 In any case, good work in both trees.
Martin
