Hmm. I will try -mm1 later today, but my problems started with
2.5.68-bk18 (IIRC). This is also a SMP-system, Dual P3 (But VIA
chipset): But it's a pity you don't see the problem. I was hoping
everyone had it :) Well, I'll try to insert some printk's and stuff, and
see what happens. And try -mm1
Best regards,
