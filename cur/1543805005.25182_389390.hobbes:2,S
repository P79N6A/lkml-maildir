As far as I can tell, all the sets and clears happen from the same 
single-threaded workqueue, but one mirror_map() could run alongside:
        r = ms->rh.log->type->in_sync(ms->rh.log,
                                      bio_to_region(&ms->rh, bio), 0);
which uses:
        ext2_test_bit(bit, (unsigned long *) bs) ? 1 : 0;
So far I haven't found any races here that would cause problems.
(And if there are any, they're probably wider than just making
those operations atomic.)
And it also looks like this code doesn't handle barriers correctly...
