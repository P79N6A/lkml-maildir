Hi,
I just upgraded to 2.2.12 and I get the following in "/var/log/messages"
"kernel: martian source fe01a8c0 for 0201a8c0, dev eth0"
This also gets written out on the current virtual console.
Any idea what's causing this and how to fix it?
Please reply in E-mail or at least give a CC as I'm not on this list.
Thx.
