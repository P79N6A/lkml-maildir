Point me in the right direction. After reading over your slides and SMP paper 
(still have the labs.pdf on my queue), it seemed to me that you could easily 
simulate what you want with lots of UML's talking to each other. I think you 
would need to create some kind of device that uses a file or a shared memory 
segment as the cluster's memory. Actually, I think that (shared memory) is 
how Jeff had intended on implementing SMP in UML anyway. At this point I 
don't think UML supports SMP though I know of at least one person who was 
attempting it.
Once said device would implemented, you could start working on the unique 
challenges ccClusters present. I guess this would be what you consider 
"bootstrapping", although I don't really know what that would entail at this 
point. Then you just need some bored college student :) to hack it out.
I've been negligent in following this mammoth link...cluebat me if you 
mentioned it somewhere upthread.
