Come on, you and I normally agree, but 100,000 threads?  Where is the need
for that?  More importantly, is there any realistic application that can 
use 100,000 threads where the kernel stack is 0 but the user level stack
doesn't have exactly the same problem?  The kernel can be perfect, i.e.,
cost zero, and you still have a problem.
