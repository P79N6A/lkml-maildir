That wouldn't be easy to do. In struct vc_data (data about VC tty device) 
you have vc_top and vc_bottom. Normally vc_top is 0 and vc_bottom is that 
last row on your screen. For the logo we move vc_top down a little bit. 
The problem is after we start minigetty on the various /dev/ttyX as soon 
as you VC switch you reintialize the screen to the standard behavior of 
vc_top = 0 and vc_bottom is the last row. It would take hacks to the upper 
console layer to do that. 
	You can write a userland app to do this. There are esc sequence 
that change vc_top. You could even alter minigetty if you want.
