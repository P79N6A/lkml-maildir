There are many points mentioned in this discussion like:
- possibility of regressions for existing users
- time until the new code is actually stable and well-tested
- long-term maintainability
The faster availability is a point, but it's only one amongst many 
points.
And it's not that we are talking about a feature not yet available in 
Linux at all. Instead of suffering, couldn't the few people in urgent 
need of 48-bit support use JFS or XFS?
