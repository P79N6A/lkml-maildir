Not sure.  It seems to work fine here.
Are you using ALSA or OSS?  Best bet is ALSA.  You want something like:
        CONFIG_SND=y
        CONFIG_SND_SEQUENCER=y
        CONFIG_SND_OSSEMUL=y
        CONFIG_SND_MIXER_OSS=y
        CONFIG_SND_PCM_OSS=y
        CONFIG_SND_SEQUENCER_OSS=y
        CONFIG_SND_EMU10K1=y
And then do not include any of the OSS stuff.
Then a normal audio playback on /dev/audio or whatever should work fine.
If not, do you see any errors during boot?
