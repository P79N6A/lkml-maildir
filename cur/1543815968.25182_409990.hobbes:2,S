Nothing conclusive.  Some of the difference may be because interbench
has a dependency on the idle sleep path popping tasks in a prio 16
instead of 18.  Some of it may be because I'm not restricting IO, doing
that makes a bit of difference.  Some of it is definitely plain old
jitter.
Six hours is long enough.  I'm all done chasing interbench numbers.
