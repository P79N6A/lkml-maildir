Ok this is a first cut at the merge. It seems to work ok. I've run mixed
scsi/ide and gimp on a 486 with it. The flare tool is really good for
pasting a halo on DaveM while testing...
There's some stuff in here thats not totally clean - ie noise diffs for
spacing etc. I'll clean those up for ac2. This also has the enable_irq bug
that 2.1.132 proper has - Linus 1 liner applies to both and will be in ac2
