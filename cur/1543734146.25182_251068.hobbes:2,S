Yes, I agree 100%!
Drivers for `modern' hardware (e.g. PCI, USB), shouldn't be a problem, since
they have good dependencies.
`legacy' hardware is more of a problem. Since the consensus was that CONFIG_ISA
is meant to indicate ISA slots, perhaps we need something like CONFIG_XBUS to
mark all these legacy drivers?
