Trying to print these using printks renders the system unbootable. With
help from RAS folks around me, managed to get a systemtap script, 
probe kernel.statement("quicklist_trim@mm/quicklist.c:56")
{
        printf(" q->nr_pages is %d, min_pages is %d ----> %s\n",
$q->nr_pages, $$
min_pages, execname());
}
we managed to get your required information. Last 10,000 lines are
attached (The uncompressed file comes to 500 kb).
Hope it helps.
Thanks,
