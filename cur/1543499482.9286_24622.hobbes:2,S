    We know that.  It also means devfs is superfluous.  You might as well
    have a devmgr process with no need for a devfs at all.
    ..
hpa,
    I prefer devfs to a manually maintained /dev.  As for how devfs would
compare with a hypothetical "devmgr", I will wait until someone produces
one.  How would devmgr divine the current kernel/hardware configuration?
Cheers,
bruce.
