Subject: How to locate struct file * from a bio?

Short question:  Is it possible to locate the struct file * associated
with a bio?  If so, how?
Longer version:  I am working on a project that requires measuring the
popularity of each file in a filesystem.  I have made several attempts
to locate all the file reads by grepping for ->readpage() and
->readpages() calls, but I am still missing several file reads.  I
have not yet looked for file writes.
I *have* been able to catch every bio access, which leads to my
question.   Is it possible to locate the struct file * associated with
a bio?  If so, how?  Efficiency is not my primary issue right now.
I'm mainly concerned with it "just working."
Thanks in advance!
