I bought a copy of Open Sources and there is a section from Linus's chapter that
deal with this issue.
Linus talks about his decision to only allow proprietary modules if they only used
system calls and not considered linking against the kernel:
"The result for module makers was that you could write a proprietary module if you
used only the normal interface for loading.............If anyone were to abuse the
guidelines by using the exported symbols in such a way that they are doing it just
to circumvent the GPL, then I feel there would be a case for suing that person."
I took a good look at MOSIX's web site and sent some email to the group.  I decided
that what they were up to was a circumvention of the GPL.
I for one can't believe that an academic team would be involved in such a thing.
It is clear that they are trying to leverage Linux's popularity to push their
product.  MOSIX was developed on FreeBSD which isn't encumbered by the GPL.  It
would appear that they have tried to preserve this state of affairs with Linux.
