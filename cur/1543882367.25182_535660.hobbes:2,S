(You are right, this should have been u64)
Snapshot image is by design limited by ammount of lowmem. If you want
to change that, this unsigned long limit will be least of your
problems.
(And no, I'd not expect loaded 6GB box to suspend properly. It will
just realize it does not have enough lowmem and refuse to suspend).
