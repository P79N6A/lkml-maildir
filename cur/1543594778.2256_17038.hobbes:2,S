I can second that.
I recently mentioned an OS/2 abonination called Feature Install.  Around 1996 
I tried to port Feature Install to java 1.0.  I got as far as the response 
file reading code, and reading in a 100k file exhausted available memory on 
the 32 megabyte machine I was working on.
Remember, every single java object includes a BUNCH of data, including two 
semaphores (one event, one mutex) and who knows what else.  On OS/2 the 
overhead of a java 1.0 object (new Object();) was 2 kilobytes!  In later 
versions they got that down to around 200k, but it's still just rediculous.  
Every single String, every pointless Integer() wrapper, every temporarily 
created Stringbuffer() discarded by a + operation left there littering the 
stack.
Plus I have yet to see a JVM that actually reclaims heap space after a 
garbage collect and gives it back to the OS.  (You have to be able to 
relocate objects to do this at all reliably...)
So if you create a large number of small objects, EVER, (tree, etc,) it's 
going to explode the heap and it'll never come down until the program exits.

Also true.
The Graphics class isn't too bad, and lightweight containers are actually 
quite nice.  But swing is just insanely bad (I have to understand 
model/view/controller and select a look-and-feel just to pop up a dialog with 
an "ok" button?), and the only serious third party challenger to it was from 
MIcrosoft...
