    My expertise is limited by a fuzzy memory, and I know it's bad form to
comment much on english usage or spelling as they are often tangential to
the issue at hand, but as long as we are on the topic, I think you had it
right the first time.
    I believe the comment, properly used the "imperative":
declaring intended usage of the variable, i.e. - "Do this or do
that"; "Default to 0 or set to 1".  To use a perl like example:
                       # set probe action:
probe=0;               # default to 0 (don't force)
probe=1 if (X || Y);   # and set to 1 (force), if either X or Y is set
    If you use "Defaults", then I think that's an implied 3rd person
singular usage and for correct parallelism, the parallel clause (after
the "and") should use the same tense.  Third person tense for "set"
would use "is" as a passive-voice auxiliary: "[it] is set to 1..."
    Saying "default to 0" is like the perlism:
    setup values of v:
    v=0;               # default to 0
    v=1 if (X || Y);   # and set to 1 if X or Y is set
 
    I can't believe we are discussing grammer concerns in comments in
the linux-kenel.  :-) (!).
