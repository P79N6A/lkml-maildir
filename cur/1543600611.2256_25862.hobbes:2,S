_Very_ glad to hear this.

I am surprised you have no problems with CONFIG_SMP=y &&
CONFIG_PREEMPT=y.  Promising.

I would love this.  We could use some SMP datapoints badly.
You can run some of the tests made especially for testing latency, like
an audio benchmark.  One such test is at
http://www.gardena.net/benno/linux/latencytest-0.42.tar.gz
Obviously a heavily tasked I/O benchmark is useful, I have used dbench
in the past (
ftp://samba.org/pub/tridge/dbench/
) (try it with 16
processes or so), but I have been told I should use bonnie.
You can time normal things, too. `time make dep clean bzImage' is always
a favorite :)
Under UP, enabling preemption helps all of this (the recent linuxdevices
article on preemption shows a 30x decrease in latency.).  Both myself
and Nigel have run dbench with good results for -16.  See
http://kpreempt.sourceforge.net/
 for some more.
whatever you can... anyhow, thank you for the positive feedback.
