   The way I see it, someone out there is subscribing people without
   their knowledge somehow.  I don't know how that can be prevented,
   but please someone look into it ASAP.
It's been dealt with, someone (not at uswest) subscribed legitimately
then added ~40 uswest addresses to their .forward file.
This user has been removed as of this morning.
Later,
