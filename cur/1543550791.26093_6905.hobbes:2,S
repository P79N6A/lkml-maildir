Heh - the first drive I saw this on was an old HP IDE drive only
capable of burning at double-speed. The second - a Yamaha SCSI
drive - does support CDRW, but I rarely use it. The Yamaha does
quad-speed, which is what I used when the burn faild.
Haven't had any problems prior to this with these drives running at
their max speed, though. And the same drive burns the same image
just fine while running 2.2.17.
No DVD support on either of the two.
