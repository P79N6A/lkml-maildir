Well, the major issue is if we want an error message (extern inline)
or potentially majorly bloated code because the same code has been
produced in multiple translation units (static inline).  Ideally, the
linker should have some kind of merging pass to merge these multiple
instances -- this really could help C++ template instantiation
problems as well -- but for now, the only "safe" way is pretty much to
provide a library with non-inlined versions and hope nothing gets
linked from it.
