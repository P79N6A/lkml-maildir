You can check that they get to the wire in (almost?) all cases by watching
the return value for the sendto call.  And, if you have decent buffers on
the receive side, and a clean transport, then you can send at very high speeds
w/out dropping any significant number of packets, even when using select/poll and
non-blocking sockets...
