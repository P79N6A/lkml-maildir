from looking at the new code, it looks like this is due to how we mmap
our dma pages. due to opengl using large (multiple megabyte) push
buffers, we allocate individual physically discontiguous pages, then
mmap them in one call. we end up iterating over all of the pages with
individual calls to remap_pfn_range.
it appears this new warning doesn't like that and will complain,
unless VM_INCOMPLETE is set. when, if ever, is it valid to set
VM_INCOMPLETE? I'm guessing that the answer is to rely on the nopage
handler to map these pages individually. but I'm not clear how
dropping back and forth between user/kernel mode for each page between
each call to remap_pfn_page would be more efficient than just calling
remap_pfn_page for each page while we're already in kernel space.
Thanks,
Terence
