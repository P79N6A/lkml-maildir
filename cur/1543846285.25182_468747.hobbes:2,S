As best I can, yes.  IDE being somewhat black-boxish to most of us.
The patch literally does no more than shut up the warning found in
drivers/pcmcia/pcmcia_resource.c ... it doesn't change any other
behavior in the PCMCIA layer.  And the IDE layer never appeared to
have a problem.
The IRQ handler seems to be drivers/ide/ide-io.c::ide_intr() and
comments there reflect the expectation that it handle shared IRQs.
