We can resolve the second requirement (but not the first) in a
different way, by adjusting the timestamp when the inode is re-read
from disk.
When re-reading an inode, rounding the time up is done by setting the
tv_nsec field to 999999999.
If the on-disk timestamp is "now", i.e. the current second if it's a
1-second resolution, then we can avoid setting the timestamp to a
future time by setting the tv_nsec field to the current wall time's
nanosecond value.  There is no need to round the time up any more than that.
However, sponteneous mtime changes are not polite.  So I broadly agree
with the principle of:

All Linux filesystems - the nanoseconds field is retained on in-memory
inodes by the generic VFS code.  The stored resolution varies among
filesystems, with the coarsest being 2 seconds (FAT), and some do
store nanoseconds.  AFAIK there is no way to determine the stored
resolution using file operations alone.
This behaviour was established in 2.5.48, 18th November 2002.
The behaviour might not be restricted to Linux, because non-Linux NFS
clients may be connected to a Linux NFS server which has this behaviour.
