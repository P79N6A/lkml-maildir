I'd prefer that change also.  In fact I just modified (trivial)
send_lots_of_email.pl (gregkh_patchbomb mailer) to do this,
except that I just have it create an mbox that I email via
msmtp.  (and it reads a 'sendpatchset' control file for input
instead of needing to modify the script source file itself)

A patch series such as:
PATCH 0/n: intro/summary
|_ PATCH 1/n: desc1
|_ PATCH 2/n: desc2
|_ PATCH 3/n: desc3
should imply a patch order also, shouldn't it?  At least it does
to me and to users of Paul Jackson's 'sendpatchset' script,
which acts in this way.
