yup.  This problem also exists in ext2, reiserfs (unless using
ordered-mode), JFS, others.

yup.

If your computer is used by multiple users who don't trust each other,
sure.  That covers, what?  About 2% of machines?
I was using data=writeback for a while on my most-thrashed disk.  The
results were a bit disappointing - not much difference.  ext2 is a lot
quicker.
(I don't use anything which is fsync-happy, btw).  (I used to have a patch
which sysctl-tunably turned fsync, msync, fdatasync into "return 0" for use
on the laptop but I seem to have lost it)
