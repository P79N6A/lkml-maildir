   Also, if you add PG_highmem, I bet current page_alloc will suck
   badly (even the way how is PG_dma done now is very unefficient).
No, it's actually pretty simple.  The difference is that PG_dma "must"
get a PG_dma page.  Whereas PG_highmem says such a page is "OK" if
that is what you happen to find.
This means that all that is needed is to treat PG_highmem pages as if
you didn't see them at all if the __get_free_pages() does not say that
they are ok.
I don't claim that this will be fast, but it will be simple and work.
