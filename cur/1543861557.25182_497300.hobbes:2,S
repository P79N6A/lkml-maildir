That's way better than programs:
- which assume an encoding you can't write most world languages in (BTW
ISO-8859-1 & US-ASCII are broken by design for Western Europe since at
least the Euro creation)
- which perpetuate the myth local 8-bit encodings are manageable (they
aren't, people spent decades trying to limp along with them, unicode &
UTF-8 where not created just to make your life miserable)
Show me one program that spurns Unicode I'll show you one that "passed on"
iso-8859-15 (typically, though it's the easiest non-iso-8859-1 to do)
The only reason you have the UTF-8 big stick approach nowadays is people
have tried for years to get app writers manage 8-bit locales properly to
dismal results. The old system was only working for en_US users (and
perhaps to .uk people)
