Hmm, yeah ... -EINVAL should do it.

The sendfile() mainloop is in generic_file_sendfile().
generic_file_sendpage() is called via the file_send_actor() from
do_generic_file_read(). Therefore generic_file_sendpage() is called for
every page which is written to the file. Since signals are checked
before every page this is solving the uninterruptible problem. IMHO, the
sendpage() should not be interrupted in between a single page.

The return value of sendfile() is not the same as the return value of
sendpage(). This is done in file_send_actor().

This issue comes up every now and than. I know of at least two users: 
COW links and my union mounts. I think this solution is quite good. I 
tested it under qemu and it is working for me.
