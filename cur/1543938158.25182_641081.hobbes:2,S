    I'm writing a driver for DVB-C PCI receiving cards these days and
I found a tricky problem of interrupts. Since kernel-2.6.19 the
interrupt handlers get rid of "struct pt_regs*" argument  and I think
it will be easy for me to modify the driver to fit for the recent
kernel.
   I simply delete the "struct pt_regs *" argument of my interrupt
handler and compile the driver again. But then I met a rather tricky
problem. I cann't get the PCI intterrupt now! I found that the chip on
the card actually had generate an interrupt and it should not be the
hardware problem.
  I'm get seriously confused. My driver works well under kernel-2.6.18
but not generates a single interrupt signal when works above
kernel-2.6.19.
 Does anybody meet similar problems?
 Sincerely
 Yours, Lost Graden.
