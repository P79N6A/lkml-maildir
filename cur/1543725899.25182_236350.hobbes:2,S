That behaviour is no longer supported as it meant that you would have
different superblocks (and hence different out-of-sync caches) between
the 2 mountpoint. It is in any case not a behaviour that is supported on
any other Linux filesystems.
If you want readonly to be an exception, then you will have to move the
MS_RDONLY flag from being a superblock option to being a vfsmount
option, then propagate that vfsmount information down to all the tests
of IS_RDONLY(inode). Not a trivial task, and not one that looms high on
my list of priorities...
Cheers,
