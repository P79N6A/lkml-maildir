have you unpacked the source and made a diff? is the source the same
then? perhaps its something with CPU/RAM ? Ever thought of that. If only
you have it, then what kind of libraries are you using, perhaps it some

It would be interesting to investigate this further. Because if bz2 is
not save to transport data, then you can't use it anymore.
