Dear kernel developers,
I know, I know, I am not supposed to use gcc 3.x with linux kernel build,
but maybe someone can just give me a hint what gcc option to add to NTFS
build to get it to work?
I just tried to build 2.5.15 and it stops during compilation of
fs/ntfs/aops.c because of included header file layout.h:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.5.15/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes
-Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common
-pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i686  -DNTFS_VERSION=\"2.0.6\"
-DDEBUG -DKBUILD_BASENAME=aops  -c -o aops.o aops.c
In file included from attrib.h:31,
                 from debug.h:31,
                 from ntfs.h:43,
                 from aops.c:30:
