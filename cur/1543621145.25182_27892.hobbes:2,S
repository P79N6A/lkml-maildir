Lately, whenever I try to access a certain part of my hard drive, I
get messages like:
Feb 12 21:16:27 localhost kernel: hdc: read_intr: status=0x59 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest Error }
Feb 12 21:16:27 localhost kernel: hdc: read_intr: error=0x01 { AddrMarkNotFound }, LBAsect=34508632, sector=32410984
Feb 12 21:16:27 localhost kernel: ide1: reset: success
Feb 12 21:16:27 localhost kernel: hdc: read_intr: status=0x59 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest Error }
Feb 12 21:16:27 localhost kernel: hdc: read_intr: error=0x01 { AddrMarkNotFound }, LBAsect=34508632, sector=32410984
Feb 12 21:16:27 localhost kernel: end_request: I/O error, dev 16:02 (hdc), sector 32410984
except that the first two messages are repeated several more times, at
intervals of a few seconds.  Also, during the first bad access, DMA
gets disabled.  While this is going on, the system load goes way up,
and I don't seem to be able to do anything else.
Is this typical behavior for a hard drive which has developed bad
blocks?  And if I blacklist the affected blocks in the filesystem,
should I also blacklist a few previous blocks in order to avoid
problems with the readahead feature of the IDE drivers?
