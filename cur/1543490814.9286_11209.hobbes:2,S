	The knfsd 1.2 RPM package upgrades the rc script properly
	so that it uses the  "--no-nfs-version 3" parameter.
	However, the machine still gets stuck for 10 minutes or more on the
	rpc.kstatd when it reboots.
	Another thing to put on the performance side is that rpc.kmountd
	is jumping to 20%-30% CPU for a few seconds when an attempt is
	done to mount a NFS partition of the server. At the same time,
	the local ypserver is raising as well (30%-40%).
	I guess that's due to the exportfs file :
	/u0     @urd(rw)
	/u1	@urd(rw)
	Our netgroup map contains 174 entries, for a total of 42K
	bytes. @urd has to recurse a bit to have the complete list
	of the machines.
	May that size explain the sometimes slow mount reaction
	time (from two seconds to 5 or 6 seconds over a 100 Mb/s
	link).
A+
