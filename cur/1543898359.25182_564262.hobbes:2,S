Most of the patch looks ok. Do you want to wait for some more tests or should I
chuck this into the imminent merge window?

This seems unrelated to the rest of the patch. Also, high-speed won't be enabled
unless you set the appropriate caps (which should be checked against timing
specifications, not just assigned and hope for the best).

This also looks unrelated.
