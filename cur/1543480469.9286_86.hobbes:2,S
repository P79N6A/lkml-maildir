With 2.2.0pre7 I noticed that my system (upon boot up) has a loadavg of
about .85-1.00 when I have XFree86 3.3.2 running and basically doing
nothing.
The first thing I noticed was that "exec wmaker" in my .xinitrc file was
now creating a zombie shell process until I killed X. I assumed at first
this was the reason for the loadavg sitting around 1.0 on the system.
Changing my .xinitrc to simply run "wmaker" fixed the zombie process
(though I dont recall seeing this in any other pre-2.2 releases) but the
loadavg was still hovering around 1.0 (or slightly less).
When I run vmstat 1 1000000 I see the (cs) field (context switch) jumping
from ~110 to 20k or 25k or 30k every other second. Switching back to pre6
has eliminated this problem. 
The system I am having this problem on is a ASUS P2B, pII 450Mhz, 128Mb
DIMMs, AHA-2940UW with a mix of EIDE and SCSI devices. The kernel is
compiled as "PPro or Pentium II" using MTRR and gcc 2.7.2.3.
