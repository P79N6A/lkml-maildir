Subject: [RFC] One solution for the oom/overcommit debate
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

I'm writing a daemon that is meant to be used in conjunction with Rik van
Riel's OOM killer patch. The following functionality is planned:
1. Per-user memory quotas
	These are overcommitted; a user can exceed the quota so long as
	system memory is not low. Think of it as a minimum resource 
	guarantee. There is a soft and a hard limit. If you exceed the
	soft limit when system memory is low, your processes are sent a
	SIGSTOP. If you exceed the hard limit, a process is selected and
	sent SIGTERM, then SIGKILL. Limits are specified in a
	configuration file.
2. Per-task priorities (not in the "nice" priority sense though)
	Some tasks should never be signalled, like the X server or a login
	shell. Other tasks should be the first to go against the wall and
	face the firing squad. If the OOM killer patch is to use this new
	task priority, I need to add an int to task_struct and a system
	call to allow the daemon to set the priority. This places policy
	in user-space, while preventing system crashes when OOM.
3. Execution on task startup
	It may be worth having the kernel signal or wake-up the daemon 
	after a new task is started. I don't know how to do this, and I'm
	not sure it's even a good idea. Perhaps instead the daemon should
	run as a real-time task?
Number 1 is mostly implemented right now (give me a few days before I
release release the code).
Questions:
1. How can I avoid using stack or library functions, especially doing file
   IO? Right now I simply ignore the SIGHUP if system memory is low, but
   the daemon still must read the /proc/[PID] files periodically.
2. I use mlockall() with MCL_FUTURE. The man page indicates that there is
   a limit to the number of locked pages. Could this be a problem on large
   machines, since I allocate several K of memory per user to store data?
Any comments would be appreciated.
Dave
