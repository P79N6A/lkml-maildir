Ok, I've implemented it using two pipes, and it works. But it does seem 
a bit wasteful...in case one client is not keeping up, the data will 
have to be tee():ed first from pipe1 to pipe2, only to then find out 
that the splice() from pipe2 to socket only does a partial transfer 
after which the data in pipe2 has to be thrown away and then the loop 
starts over with the next client.
A tee() from pipe1 to the socket could (I imagine) realize immediately 
that the socket does not have enough buffer space and return EWOULDBLOCK 
and avoid at least one copy?
