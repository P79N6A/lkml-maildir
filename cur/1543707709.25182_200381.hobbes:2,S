Hi.  IEEE1394 _is_ working for 2.6.3.  Recent changes made it more
stable than ever (hotplugging is working with the most recent changes)
--at least for the hardware that I have.  If it isn't working for you
confirm your setup by following the guide for 2.6 at
http://www.linux1394.org/
 (as things have changed since 2.4.x).  Also
you can get the latest changes from there, and recompile your kernel. If
it still isn't working, send a bug report (be sure to list your
hardware/chips, the kernel modules you have loaded, error messages, the
kernel version, and any relevant debug information from dmesg or
/var/log/messages) to the 1394 maintainer.  
Cheers,
Bob
