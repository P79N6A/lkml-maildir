    However, there still is one problem. Some applications that use kernel
    interfaces that aren't quite integrated into (g)libc yet sometimes
    use #include <linux/whatever.h>, like gated with Alexeys latest patches.
    If you compile those with -I/usr/src/linux-2.2.10, then a
    #include <net/route.h> will include the one from /usr/src/linux/include/net
    instead of /usr/include/net, and those are _very_ different .. the
    only way to solve this would be to rename the include/net directory
    in the kernel to something else. Say, linux-net or linux/net.
    I'd love to hear if someone had a workaround for this.
Wouldn't compiling with -I/usr/include -I/usr/src/linux-2.2.10/include
do what you want? (Take the glibc version if it exists, peek at the
kernel sources otherwise.)
