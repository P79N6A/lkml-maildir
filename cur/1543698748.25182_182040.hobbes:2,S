If glibc-kernheaders (used only if you do not have real kernel source 
code installed) is GPL, and many of the standard Linux include files end 
up including either headers from glibc-kernheaders (or the real Linux 
kernel source if you have it installed and symlinked), then by extension 
the glibc library built for Linux must be GPL as would all programs 
linked against it.
