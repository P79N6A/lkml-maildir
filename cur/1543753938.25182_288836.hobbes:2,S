Has anyone tried loopback mounting individual partitions from within a
file that contains a partition table?
When I mount -o loop the file, I seem to get the first partition in the
file, but I don't see anything in the man page for mount that indicates a
way of getting any other partitions from a file with a partition table.
Any comments?
Thanks!
