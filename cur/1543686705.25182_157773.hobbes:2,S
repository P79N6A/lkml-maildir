Indeed.  In the context of x = first 80 bits of SHA-1 hash, y = second
80 bits of SHA-1 hash, we are assuming that the entropy of x and y are
basically equal.  Then xoring them together gives us no benefit over
taking just one or the other, and may reduce the entropy if the output
of SHA-1 is correlated between the two halves in any way (which seems
more likely than not).
Including a little more context, then:
If entropy(x) == entropy(y), then:
entropy(x) >= entropy(x xor y)
entropy(y) >= entropy(x xor y)
Amusingly, someone already worked their way backwards from my post
without the benefit of any context to find that it implied that
entropy(x) == entropy(y).  I should know better than to assume that
people have read the entire thread before posting.
Apologies to Matt for sidetracking the discussion.  He has come up
with a nice solution despite our kibitzing.
