Uh, what?  LVM2 is perfectly backwards compatible w/ LVM1.  Of course,
snapshots don't work w/ LVM2 yet, so I'm not sure how LVM2 handles LVM1
snapshot volumes.   In general, volumes created w/ LVM1 tools should
work fine with device-mapper/LVM2.  I've been using LVM2 for 8+ months;
when I've needed to do things that aren't yet implemented with LVM2 (for
example, pvmove'ing), I've simply downgraded to LVM1 temporarily, done
the task, and then upgraded my tools again.

It's not denial.  I'm just selective about the reality I accept.
