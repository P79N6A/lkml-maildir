You have to do this in a driver, the scheduling latency are too long
to run an ordinary process (there is hope that it can be brought down to
5 ms)
* Can you get an interrupt for each bit accepted?
* Maximum rate, timing from bit to ACK?
* Are you going to send a block of data on occasion?
* Do you mind blocking the whole computer during sends?
If no interrupt and yes to these two, you could probably
do with a loop using usleep(20)
* Or do you like to do this continuously?
I hope not! :-)
You might also want to look at RT-Linux (quite a different low level
approach)
On the HW side could you consider adding a buffer using some
programmable
logic? It sounds like a simple problem shifting out data at ACK rate.
With a FIFO buffer and some kind of computer interface... A evaluation
board should do it...
