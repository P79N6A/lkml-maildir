Hi Jens,
sorry but maybe we weren't that explicit, here's a pointer to the relevant
thread: 
http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-ide@vger.kernel.org/msg15541.html.
 It
boils down to removing the statically allocated arrays of buffers for pc and rq
structs in ide-floppy and ide-tape, and using GFP_ATOMIC stack memory instead.
Bart's idea was to even go a step further and even avoid allocation errors in
out-of-mem situations by reusing requests from the request queue but wasn't sure
whether this'll fly and wanted to run it by you...
Thanks.
