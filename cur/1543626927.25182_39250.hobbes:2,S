I didn't think this is relevant, except if I were trying to copy a CD on
the fly, but that's not the case. But I have now tried it, no change. In
fact, what I tried was this linux-2.4.19-pre5-jam2 patch collection
which includes that and low latency and O(1) scheduler patches, among
other things.  Didn't seem to help, however.
