While that's true, it'll have an even bigger memory overhead than it
already does (simplemalloc, by trapping into the kernel and creating
vm_area/vm_list structures for every malloc call, has huge overheads in
both time and space).
I've posted this as an RFD to get a feeling for whether we can change
behaviour here - I do expect that nommu embedded systems are less
constrained by backwards compatibility considerations, but I'd like to
hear from other embedded users whether this is a change they'd welcome.
