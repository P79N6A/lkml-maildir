Thanks for the hint. If I interpreted the 2.6.24 changelog correctly
this patch is already included with 2.6.24 ? The problem still occurs
with 2.6.24.2. I am currently trying to find the minimal kernel config
which still triggers this problem. Any other hints for finding the
cause of this issue are welcome of course.
