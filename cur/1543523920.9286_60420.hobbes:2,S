I have the following question about this patch. What will happen if a
kernel root kit module has been installed that hides tasks, I/O calls and
networking?
I am not suggesting that the two machines in question may have this problem. I
am asking in general. Can this patch be also considered a security measure for
at least some of the kernel module root kits? They should be calling sched and
so on quite often when they are not supposed to/expected to in order to work...
