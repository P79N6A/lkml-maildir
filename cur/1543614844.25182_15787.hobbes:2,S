Crap.  Back in 1995, I had to compile a kernel to get Linux installed,
because the packaged kernel did not include support for ATAPI CD-ROM
drives.  I had no Unix experience whatsoever, basically what you call a
newbie.
And, no, the situation has not changed.  There are
- people/cooperations without Linux kernel compilation experience, who
  might need a feature that's only available in a development kernel,
- *newbies*, that are generally interested in learning Linux in all its
  ways.
Your attitude strikes me as unnessicarily elitist.
Cheers,
Viktor
