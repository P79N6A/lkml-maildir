It started to give me following errors:
EXT2-fs error (device sd(8,6)): ext2_add_entry: bad entry in directory
#28699: rec_len is smaller than minimal - offset=1024, inode=0,
rec_len=0, name_len=0
And sometimes a couple:
EXT2-fs error (device sd(8,6)): ext2_readdir: bad entry in directory
#28699: rec_len is smaller than minimal - offset=1024, inode=0,
rec_len=0, name_len=0
There are a lot of instances of this but the dir # is the same.
The directory in question seems to PostgreSQL data directory
/var/lib/postgresql/data and it started when I tried to create a
database into this.  Otherwise the PostgreSQL works ok.
No Oops yet.
Kernel is UP 2.4.0-test9-pre7+ext2-patch-7.  Nothing else.
What other info is needed?  And please also directions how to get it :)
This is my workstation and although I have not made any stress-testing
here, it has survived my usual daily activity...
Hmm, I am starting to think that maybe I _should_ make backups...
