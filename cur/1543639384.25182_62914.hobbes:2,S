Please don't do this with locking, I really think the right thing to do
is to have a "duplicate()" function, and when you pass credentials off
to something, you dup them at that point.
If you start off as non-root, and then execve suid into root, a pending
NFS request should _not_ suddently have the credentials changed under
it. Yet clearly that kind of thing can't just be locked either.
Along with copy-on-write semantics, this should perform perfectly well
(ie "duplicate()" would only increment a count, and then setuid() would
have to have code soemthing like
	if (cred->count > 1) {
		newcred = alloc_cred();
		copy_cred(newcred, cred);
		for_each_cred_group(p) {
			p->cred = newcred;
			atomic_inc(&newcred->count);
			putcred(cred);
		}
	}
instead.
