Hi all,
	`This document describes the common routines, locking systems
and general requirements for kernel code: its goal is to serve as a
primer for Linux kernel development.'
I won't expand this into a book (it'd be unmaintainable, and hence
useless), but additions, comments and gotchyas appreciated.
