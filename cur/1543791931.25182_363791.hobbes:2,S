It was useless, you can get exactly the same information by using RDPMC 
on perfctr 0 which always runs the NMI watchdog and counts all cycles too.
And even with that I don't want to have such checks in the context switch 
for something that is at best theoretical. Letting it in would open the 
floodgates for making the context switch really slow long term.
