I was wondering if someone could explain the effects (if any) of this bug
on try_to_free_page and friends? I've been unable to reproduce the NTFS oops
I've been whining about for a while (caused by kmalloc() inexplicably
failing) since I applied the 2.2.1 patch, I wondered if this was the reason;
maybe I just haven't been trying hard enough?
