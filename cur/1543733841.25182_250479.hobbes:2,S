Actually there are hacks floating around which do let you use XIP with
cramfs -- obviously you have to dispense with compression for the files
you want to access that way.
You won't gain at runtime by using XIP though. Your code and data will
end up in RAM _whatever_ file system you use, and you'll be running from
page cache.
You may get a _slightly_ faster startup time after reboot if you use XIP
from flash, because it doesn't have to be loaded into RAM first. But
that comes at the cost of making it all a low slower during normal
operation -- it's a lot slower to fetch icache lines from flash than it
is from RAM.
Arjan's right -- you almost certainly don't really want XIP.
