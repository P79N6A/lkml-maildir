At least for x86-64 I would recommend that, as you can count on it existing.
For normal x86 it is more interesting.  But you are less likely to run with 
lots of memory so this case is less likely to show up. I have already heard
people seriously discussing 16GB on an off the shelf on an x86-64
system.  Getting 2GB PC2700 DIMMs is still a bit of a challenge, but
the practical memory size barrier (3GB per task) is finally gone.
For x86-64 a software ``mtrr'' that maps everything the e820 map says
is memory as write-back and everything else as uncacheable by default would
be nice.  As the mtrr interface is already understood by things like X.  And
there needs to be some data structure that remembers what the page
cache-ability attributes should be.
