On the two systems where I've seen this, the recipe is to set up an
SMP+NFS+XFS server, and have a number of clients mount the exported
filesystem, then perform reads and writes...
The two servers are used very differently - one is holding a small
number of source trees that are compiled/linked on a small cluster. The
other is holding a very large number of user home directories, where the
primary use is web serving (web servers running on the NFS clients).
A google for 'debug.c:106' turns out some 120 results - it seems that no
special magic is needed, other than a few boxes to set up the test
scenario.
On the 29th of februrary, akp@cohaesio.com submitted (as comment #23 to
bug #309) a description of a test setup along with a shell script that
was used to trigger this problem.
