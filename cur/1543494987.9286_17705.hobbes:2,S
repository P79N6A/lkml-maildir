Hi, 
	recently I started reading kernel sources (2.0.36). Now I am looking at
how kernel modules are built with 'make modules'. Now my problem is:
For example in the Makefile for the isdn-drivers I find
[...]
  ifeq ($(CONFIG_ISDN),m)
    M_OBJS += isdn.o
    O_TARGET += isdn.o
    O_OBJS += isdn_net.o isdn_tty.o isdn_v110.o
    OX_OBJS += isdn_common.o
   [...]
   endif
[...]
Here my first question: What is the difference between M_OBJS, O_OBJS, etc.?
But what is even more interesting: Where is a rule to BUILD the M_OBJS
for example? Looking at Rules.make I cannot find where that is build.
(I do find a rule for OX_OBJS though.)
Well, maybe I am just missing something. It would be nice, if you
could bring me back "to the right way". I am sure there is an easy
explanation ;-)
Are there probably some documents around, which describe the
make_modules concept in detail?
Thank you very much for your efforts.
Dennis
