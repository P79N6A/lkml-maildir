Ok, culprit identified: /var/spool/lpd/lpd.lock
On another partition I had the same problem with httpd's
error_log.
Since both of those seem to be log- and lock-files, maybe
there's something wrong with file locking?
Anyway, disabled both lpd and httpd from the startup scripts
and now the bug is triggered *every* time. I cannot reboot
a single time without partitions being busy. When neither
lpd nor httpd run, fsck finds nothing wrong.
The very strange stuff is umount at reboot:
umount: none busy - remounted read-only
umount: /: device is busy
Remounting root-filesystem read-only
mount: / is busy
Rebooting.
*fsck*
The "none" bit puzzles me the most. /etc/fstab and /etc/mtab
look perfectly ok.
Has anyone got an idea? Everything worked well with 2.4.0 and
Alan's tree up to -ac4, didn't try ac5, and ac6 is what messes
up now.
