These are the sound-settings in the BIOS:
WSS I/O: 0x530
SBPro I/O: 0x220
Synth I/O: 0x388
IRQ: 5
WSS (Play) DMA: 1
WSS (Rec) DMA & SBPro-DMA: 0
Control I/O: 0x538
MPU I/O: 0x330
The BIOS does not let me modify the I/O settings for Synth, Control and MPU. 
And as I said: The opl3sa2 module was working perfectly in kernel 2.2.17 with 
these settings. And I wonder why the message in syslog says "0x0", no matter 
what I/O address I have specified with the io= parameter.
