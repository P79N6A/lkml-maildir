Subject: Long file names in VFAT broken with iocharset=utf8

This was posted in one of Russian forums. It was not possible to archive 
(under Linux, using tar) vfat directory where files had long Russian names 
(really long - over 150 - 170 characters) - tar returned stat failure. When 
looking with plain ls, file names appeared truncated.
Now looking at current (2.6.21) fat driver, __fat_readdir allocates large 
enough buffer (PAGE_SIZE-522) for UTF-8 name; but for iocharset=utf8 it calls 
uni16_to_x8() which artificially limits length of UTF-8 name to 256 ... which 
is obviously not enough for long UTF-8 Russian string (2 bytes per character) 
not to mention the - theoretical - general case of 6 bytes UTF-8 characters.
Similar problem has apparently vfat_lookup()->...->fat_search_long() call 
chain. Except this appears to be broken even in case of "utf8", because 
fat_search_long allocates fixed 256 bytes buffer for UTF-8 name.
Am I off track here?
