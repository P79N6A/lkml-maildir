Hmm. And I could _feel_ how my dual HT P4 was slow before the irq issues 
were fixed.
Now, there have been other changes too - like the scheduler (and my
current P4 has a different SCSI interface), but I dunno. The thing I 
attributed the improvements in interactive feel was the fact that the work 
got balanced out more sanely.
