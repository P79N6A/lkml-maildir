Yes. Hence the generic code would deal with battery info, suspend/resume
events to userspace, cpu idle logic. And arches specific code would deal
with hardware to get status on battery for example. On i386 that would
lead to call the BIOS, on others arches, they would use whatever available
on the platform to report the status.

Well, maybe the first step is to unify this APM for all arches hence 
everybody could better improve it.

That's actually this status I was trying to get when posting my initial
email.
