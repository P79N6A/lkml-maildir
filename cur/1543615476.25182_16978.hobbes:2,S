SiS 5513:
- Current state:
I had no filesystem corruption on my SIS735 system since latest patch, 
had it reviewed by several readers and think to have put correct init 
code in...
- Warning:
I've not yet gotten the level of testing I'd like to (confirmation on 
other SIS735 and reports for other 5513 derivatives).
With old code ATA100 can work for some not at all for other and even for 
many systems sometime work sometime fail (seems the most probable and 
occured on my configuration).
My guess is that the chip registers don't have a defined value at system 
power on but some random probability of being right.
So I consider these fixes alpha quality untill I have success reports on 
a larger scale.
- So:
If you have SIS IDE and try the mjc branch, please report any success or 
failure directly to me (with sis chipset used it would be good, with 
mainboard model better and with BIOS rev it would be perfect).
It's quite important for future devs as I'm not comfortable with the 
current code (needed too much time to understand in my opinion). I'd 
like to rewrite several chuncks (and in fact began to do so) but am 
waiting for the current fixes to be tested on a larger scale.
