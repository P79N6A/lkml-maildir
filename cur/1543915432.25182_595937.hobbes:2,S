Thanks for your report. Unfortunately, I've rechecked the recent changelogs
and see nothing related either. At least, in order to keep trace of the
incident, would you please post some info about your config (CPU, RAM,
chipset, .config, gcc, and any possible patches you may have applied) ?
Maybe some of these info may remind old bad memories to some people.
Also, do you know if this server has ECC memory ? I would more easily
bet for side effects of one random bit flip in memory than for some
massive block corruption.
I vaguely remember about very old reports of people sometimes observing
zeroed out blocks during writes, which were attributed to chipset bugs
if my memory serves me. But I would rule this out as recent chipsets
look more stable than 5-10 years ago !
Regards,
Willy
