Using a bit <= 15 will cause kernel to take the work_notifysig path
"pending work-to-be-done flags are in LSW".  I'm not sure what happens if
there's such a flag set but nothing is set up to handle it.  I guess it
stays set and processes never get out of the kernel again.
Perhaps TIF_SECCOMP should be >= 16 too - the special-case in
_TIF_ALLWORK_MASK looks odd.
