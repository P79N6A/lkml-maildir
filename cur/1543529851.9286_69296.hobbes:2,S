fork()/exec() is the greatest thing to happen to UNIX and I trust you know
why. Using something like spawn() to invoke a new process would make me
feel dirty and in need of showering with brillo.
If just a few applications use spawn(), there's no gain. If all
applications use spawn(), then we've just butchered technology
and concepts that have been a part of people's lives for decades,
which helps make Linux far less attractive and appealing.
At least to me, anyway.
