And all I've been saying is that userspace:
1- should drop a filesystem-level note, not require calling an
   executable with a time-varying interface and no real reason to
   think it will still be in use in a couple of years
2- should drop it in sysfs, because:
   a- if it is there and cleanly defined, and "use this netlink
      message to have a symlink created in sysfs pointing to the node you
      just created" is clean and simple enough, all the concurrent
      device-node generating tools will support it quickly (hotplug,
      udev, mdev, maybe others, who knows)
   b- nothing requires at that point the devices to be in /dev
   c- sysfs already manages all the directory hierarchy or naming you
      need to define uniquely a device, why replicate it somewhere else?
At that point I guess I just need to make a patch for the kernel side
and then we'll see.
  OG.
