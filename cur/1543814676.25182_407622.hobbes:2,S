My thoughts when originally designing the API were that the architecture
may be the only bit that actually knows where the memory _is_.  So, we
shouldn't involve the generic code in figuring this out.
You can see the result of this in the next patch because there is a new
function introduced to hide the arch-specific node lookup.  If that was
simply done in the already arch-specific add_memory() function, then you
wouldn't need arch_nid_probe() and its related #ifdefs at all.
