They do?   kmap_atomic() disables preemption anyway.

The macros are needed for kmap_atomic().
The task->preempt field is also used for tracking the hardirq and softirq
depths (in_interrupt(), in_irq(), in_softirq()) so it cannot be removed
with CONFIG_PREEMPT=n.

We run inc_prempt_count() in kmap_atomic() so that we can perform
copy_*_user() while holding an atomic kmap in read() and write(). 
do_page_fault() will detect the elevated preempt count and will return a
short copy.
This could be implemented with a separate task_struct field but given that
preempt_count is always there and the infrastructure exists anyway, using
preempt_count() is tidier.
