Do I need to enable anything specific? I realized that I had neglected
to get the proper SATA power cable, so I just got one and I plugged in
my new SATA drive. There is no indication in my dmesg of any SATA
chipset or any connected SATA drives. I have the "Generic IDE
chipsets" option enabled, along with the PDC2026XX IDE card and the
VIA82CXXX chipset.
