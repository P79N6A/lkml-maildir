I recommend that from now on, the first pre-patch should be a renamed
regular devel patch.  This way, it can be tested first.  2.2-pre1, for
instance, seems rather less stable than 2.1.132.
BTW, the patch-kernel script fails with prepatch (probably a file-name
issue).
Also, if the message never gets through, still wondering whether ftape 4
will be included in 2.2.
