I followed Keith's instruction. It seems now the problem is that the
inlucde/linux/module/netsym.ver  (i put the EXPORT_SYMBOL in netsym.c
now) doesn't have the vesion for the fdbIoSwatichHook symbol.
I wonder if someone tell me how to gernerate the file with latest info,
I may be able to fix this.
In the meantime I did a distclean, and will see.
Thanks,
Jason
