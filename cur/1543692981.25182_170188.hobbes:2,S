I should probably make it clear exactly how resources are muxed in the
current version of Xen. 
 CPU: We use a proportional fair-share scheduler (Borrowed Virtual
 Time). Guests can be be given different scheduler weights ---
 if reservations are being handed out then admission control is
 required to ensure that a given guest's fair share doesn't fall below
 its guaranteed minimum.
 Memory: Each guest is allocated a share of memory when it is started
 up. This is configurable per guest. Furthermore, a guest can request
 more memory, or give some memory back, according to current load (we
 implement a "balloon driver" as described by Waldspurger in a paper
 he presented at OSDI 2002).  
 Network + disk: Currently each domain gets a fair share (we use a
 round-robin scheduler). We plan to implement weighted share r.s.n.
We're interested in exploring reservation-based schedulers but, apart
from memory, resources currently aren't statically segregated.
Xen provides an excellent base for trying out new strategies for
resource sharing. Deploying new schedulers is not that hard --- it
just requires more man power than we have right now!

In fact, one of our main aims is to provide zseries-style
virtualization on x86 hardware! We've got a fair way towards this, but
we're not fully there yet :-)

Right, another good point. The performance penalty on a range of
system benchmarks (including SPEC WEB99) shows that there's up to
around 5% overhead for running x86-xen. This is far far less than any
other virtualization of x86 that is capable of running full OSes.
So yes: we envisage Xen being a next-gen replacement BIOS, in that it
could be installed on a machine and would then be responsible for
booting and supervising all OSes running on that machine. Device
drivers would be written according to a well-defined interface,
implemented within Xen, or within isolated "domains" running atop of
Xen. This kind of fits with the previous observation -- we want
zseries for x86 :-)
