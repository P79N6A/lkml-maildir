Sorry, but this patch is still not OK. It still causes system
locking up for me.
In some cases I have (I added printk in __start_dac):
	dmabuf->count = 0
	dmabuf->ready = 1
	dmabuf->enable = 1
	PCM_ENABLE_OUTPUT set in dmabuf->triger
in __start_dac(). As result nothing was done in this procedure
and I got system locking in __i810_update_lvi() immediatelly after
that. This was reason why I added return code to __start_dac,
__start_adc to skip the loop if there is nothing to wait for.
Perhaps checking return code is more efficient and less error prone
that repeating all conditions in __i810_update_lvi. 
Maybe really we should use wait_event_interruptible() instead
of plain loop in __i810_update_lvi(). This happens not so often,
so I don't think it could cause too big delays. At least we could
avoid kernel freezing in this way.
