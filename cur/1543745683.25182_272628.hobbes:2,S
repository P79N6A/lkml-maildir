I'm not sure I accept the argument that locking will be more difficult. 
  Jason's patch requires that a callback be registered for the interrupt 
or the polling (My update has a similar scheme).  The function you 
register is essentially like an extra interrupt, except it is never 
invoked at interrupt time.  All the function has to do is react 
properly to link state.  If, previously, you checked link state in your 
interrupt handler, you could still do it there, I suspect.

I think it would be doable to arrange the interface such that drivers 
could adopt only the PHY configuration infrastructure, and not any of 
the polling/interrupt infrastructure.  Of course, as it is, it is at 
least WHOLLY optional, so no driver has to use it at all.

I agree with this point -- Accessing the PHY through /dev registers is 
a recipe for some mess.  Though I could be convinced that it is 
manageable.  I do think, however, that the ethtool interface is 
sufficient to the task.
