So far so good on my Multia which acts as the internet server/masqbox with
Vegas alpha/beta set at 3, on a 53k analog modem connection. I've noticed
much "smoother" connections. Don't have any tcpdumps to prove or disprove it
but that's just my 'ball-park' feeling of it.
This is under 2.2.10-ac12 and the patch applies cleanly (with a few offset
lines but that's no biggie)
I sent out a mass-email to about 20 people and it floored the modem lights with
SMTP/Auth connections. That was the biggest improvement (which would make sense
) I've noticed so far.

I don't have hard numbers at the moment but it looks golden here.
