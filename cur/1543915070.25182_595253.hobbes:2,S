Not true. You cannot chose the license that applies to other people's code. The code you distribute contains protectable elements from different authors. Each element is still offered under whatever license the original author offered it under.
You cannot affect the license grant from the author to the lawful possessor of code you did not author.
The code you *contribute* will be under the GPL *only* forever. But the code you distribute will contain elements from different authors offered under different licenses.

That's true.
