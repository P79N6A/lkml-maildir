And what are you going to do in the meanwhile, if reiser4 should be
fundamentally broken because namesys decided reiser11 was so much cooler
to work on, as has happened with 3.6 which still cannot handle hash
collisions properly?

Right, but accepting it into baseline is seen as "endorsement" by major
parts of the audience, and this is in fact what they like to see.

Any why can those users not download and apply a patch, try it and
report back to Namesys?
