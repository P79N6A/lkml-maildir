Ask and ye shall receive...
I created an ext3 fs, mounted it with data=writeback and gave it a quick spin.
The result? Lots of pauses and dropped frames during capture. This is during the part of the
process where I have gobs of free RAM that's being used for buffering so dropping frames here
is a cardinal sin.
Dunno why it's happening, but I saw it also with xfs and reiser4. ext2 on the other hand
chugs along happily, no pauses, no dropped frames until we run out of free RAM (takes about 2
minutes now after the simple kernel change).
I can understand dropped frames after we run out of ram, but not before.
regards, Anthony
