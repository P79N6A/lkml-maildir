No, I can't suggest anything else to try, sorry.
Traditionally i386 never printed that message (in fact neither architecture
should - it allows poeple to spam the logs, but it is at least
ratelimited).
In 2.6.23, i386 _does_ generate that message, in arch/i386/mm/fault.c
In 2.6.24 the i386 and x86_64 fault handlers were renamed to
arch/x86/mm/fault_[32|64].c and both versions generated the message.
In 2.6.25 they were unified into a single arch/x86/mm/fault.c, and both
architectures print the message.
So afacit 2.6.23 _should_ be printing the message if qmail is indeed
generating a segfault.  But there's always the possibility that the
message-printing code was simply broken in 2.6.23, and that your qmail has
always been generating segfaults.
Are any other problems observeable?  Does qmail continue to operate
normally in 2.6.24?
