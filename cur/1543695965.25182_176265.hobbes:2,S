I think the best fix would be to simply not allow more than one page
that needs to be bounced to a bio. The problem is that the whole bio and
bio_vec allocations needs to be duplicated for highmem bouncing, and
that really doesn't thrill me. So a single mempool for bio, and single
entry bio_vec would be a lot leaner. I'll see if I can squeeze out a
prototype today.
I totally agree with your analysis of the problem, though.
