You could just do something like
	while true
	do
		cat /usr/src/linux/MAINTAINERS
	done
and see if that kills it.  If so then yeah, it could be a tty thing.  If not
then it may be mm/fs/vm/harware related.  Confirm that by running
dbench/tiobench/etc.
Basically: separate it out, eliminate some variables.
The most valuable thing you can do is to narrow it down to a particular
changeset.
