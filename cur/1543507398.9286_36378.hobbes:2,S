It would be quite interesting. My prediction is that the fully premptable
nature of the system makes high bandwidth i/o unlikely. I'd really like

Raw disk and FS performance are really different. DOS gets decent raw
disk performance, but our experience is that app ports to RTLinux get
an enormous benefit from ext2.
