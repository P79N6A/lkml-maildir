Still there is a chance (who knows what has been in 8.0-pre at that
time... and changelog says that reiserfsprogs was updated on May 14
2001).

Add here:
# mount -t reiserfs -o loop tmp.img /mnt/disk
# tar -xz -f something.tar.gz -C /mnt/disk
# umount /mnt/disk
Otherwise the test seems to be unreliable.

Sometimes the root directory seems to have correct attrs, but some
files should still get garbage.

Of course - therefore Jeff Mahoney already prepared the patch to
remove the problematic feature (automatic enabling of the "attrs"
mount option) completely:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/12/76
(Backing out only the latest patch is wrong, because then the "tails"
option will remain broken.)
However, the real bug is somewhere else.

You may try to do something like "chgrp 70000" on it - the v1 stat
data format has 16-bit uid/gid fields and therefore does not support
uid/gid greater than 65535.  If "chgrp 70000" fails with "Invalid
argument", but works with a value lower than 65535, most likely the
file in question still has old stat data format.  (If both operations
fail, this may be due to broken attrs on the file which prohibit the
operation).
