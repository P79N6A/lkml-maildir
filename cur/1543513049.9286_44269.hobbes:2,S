Well there was this post about RH 6.0 kernel compiling problem. Well the
popular over clocked Celeron machines are a problem. "Not all silicon is
created equal some are more qual then others. CPU farm"
So those of you with overclocked machine.. well try compiling your kernel
when you reclock to normal.
Cheers!
