There's already interdiff from Tim Waugh's patchutils [1] that makes
incremental diffs between patches. And interdiff doesn't need the source
the patches are against (IOW: to make an incremental patch between two
kernel -pre patches you don't need any kernel sources). It's pretty
simple:
  interdiff -z patch-2.4.19-pre6.gz patch-2.4.19-pre7.gz > mydiff
