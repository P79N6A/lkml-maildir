?? (1) Is about filling /sys/... and (2) about filling /proc/...
Both only have info for user space. The kernel does not react
to this flag.

I think user space is pragmatic rather than correct.
When undesirable things happen someone will complain,
and the problem will be corrected somehow.
The distinction removable / non-removable is too primitive,
there are many variations involving chains of devices.

I told you what it does. But you ask what it is intended for.
Then you must go to the person who first introduced it.
I guess that might have been Richard Gooch. The flag came in
in patch-2.3.46 with devfs. If it is was set, devfs would set
DEVFS_FL_REMOVABLE.
+- Added DEVFS_FL_REMOVABLE flag
+
+- Check for disc change when listing directories with
+  removable media devices
One has code like
+    if (flags & DEVFS_FL_REMOVABLE)
+    {
+       de->u.fcb.removable = TRUE;
+       ++de->parent->u.dir.num_removable;
+    }
and
+static void scan_dir_for_removable (struct devfs_entry *dir)
+/*  [SUMMARY] Scan a directory for removable media devices and check media.
+    <dir> The directory.
+    [RETURNS] Nothing.
+*/
+{
+    struct devfs_entry *de;
+
+    if (dir->u.dir.num_removable < 1) return;
+    for (de = dir->u.dir.first; de != NULL; de = de->next)
+    {
+       if (!de->registered) continue;
+       if ( !S_ISBLK (de->mode) ) continue;
+       if (!de->u.fcb.removable) continue;
+       check_disc_changed (de);
+    }
+}   /*  End Function scan_dir_for_removable  */
So here you have it. It is a devfs thing and could have been
removed when devfs was removed. However, today it is exported
in sysfs, and one must worry about possible users in user space.
