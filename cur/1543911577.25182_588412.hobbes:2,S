Sounds like the drive has gotten into a really hosed state after this 
point. The SError register is showing a CRC error, disparity error, and 
10b to 8b decode error, which indicates that there are some major SATA 
communication problems happening.
It could be a hardware problem (bad drive, bad SATA cable, insufficient 
power, etc.) or maybe this is another drive with broken NCQ..
