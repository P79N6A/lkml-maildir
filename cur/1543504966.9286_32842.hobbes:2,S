That's completely bogus.  Those boot loaders (which??) are broken.  I
know for a fact that SYSLINUX has no such limit, lbcon definitely will
not have it, and hard-coding that limit into the kernel compile
sequence is a BUG.
If LILO, say, doesn't support loading a bzImage > 1 MB then LILO
should complain, but not prevent someone from compiling the image for
use with another boot loader.
