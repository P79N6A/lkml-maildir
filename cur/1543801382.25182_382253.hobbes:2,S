Userspace should do the translation. You should give the user the ability
to specify simple, meaningful states, like "on" and "off". But, it should
be the tools itself that are mapping those requests to valid input for the
sysfs files.
Why force the translation into the kernel, and provide more opportunities
for error in parsing the sysfs files? Do it in userspace, and you can
afford much more flexibility and portability.
Thanks,
