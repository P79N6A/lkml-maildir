Linus,
Please pull from 'merge' branch of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/paulus/powerpc.git merge
to get some bug fixes and documentation/comment updates for powerpc,
as listed below.
There is one commit there that isn't just a fix, the "Add endpoint
support to 4xx PCIe driver" one.  I think it's OK to go in because (a)
it's only adding functionality, (b) it only affects ppc4xx processors,
and (c) the 4xx maintainer (Josh Boyer) said about it: "Stefan's pci-e
endpoint driver is also included here as it is a fairly contained
change with Ben's Ack.  It should have been included in my last pull
request, but I missed it and have been out."
Thanks,
Paul.
