All new sysfs files should have corrisponding Documentation/ABI files
added as well, containing all of the information in the body of this
email so that others can find it in the future in an easy manner.
Mike, can you make this change please?

Care to provide an example of what these sysfs files will actually hold?
It seems like you are craming more information than needed into a single
sysfs file.
Oh, and state why this is really needed, as I thought we already showed
this kind of information today in the existing sysfs files, but I'm
probably wrong :)
