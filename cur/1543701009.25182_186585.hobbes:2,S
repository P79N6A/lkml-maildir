Well, it looks like TIO is replacing it soon, doesn't it?

Well, again talk is cheap, if you show the code this whole discussion
would be avoid.  I've done my part of showing the code and the only thing
I get in reply is bad flames and random obsfucations to break that code.

Again, I'd be more than happy if you moved that code to the PROM.  But as
long as we have code in the kernel to deal with that hardware different ports
should share it.  And as mentioned above I have that strong feeling that
for the first generation Altixens this is never going to happen.  Of course
I'd be more than happy to be proven wrong.

Again, if you do that I'd be more than happy.  But as long as we need that
code in the kernel it should be done properly.

Guess what, the current iommu code has exactly three lines of code that
make sense only for bridge.  Not to mention that I'll have no problem with
maintaining all that code, so you don't have to maintain more but rather
less code.  (In a double sense, given that the new code is also much
smaller despite support for the older revisions)
