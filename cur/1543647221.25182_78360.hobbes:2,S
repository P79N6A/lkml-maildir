I agree. Passing zero counts means "no work to do" and passing
that information is never a problem in any function.
The same goes for a segment with zero len (which is a way to
measure user space to kernel driver latency, if the driver
implements writev and readv).
It's only a "performance bug", if that is used in a real
application, no wrong parameters.
