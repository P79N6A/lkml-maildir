These are many of the same issues raised in rusty's "current /proc/ of
shit" thread from a while back.

There are more maintainability benefits from the interface improvement
than speed benefits. How many processes did you microbenchmark with?
I see no evidence that this will be a speedup with large numbers of
processes, as the problematic algorithms are preserved wholesale.
