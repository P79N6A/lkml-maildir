kmap is for quick transitory mappings.  kmap is not for permanent mappings.
At least that was my impression.  The persistence is intended to just
kill error prone cases.

This may be a reasonable use, I'm not certain.  It wasn't the application
kmap was designed to deal with though...

Why do you need such a large buffer?  And why do the pages need to be kmapped?
If you are doing dma there is no such requirement...  And unless you are
running on something faster than a PCI bus I can't imagine why you need
a buffer that big.  My hunch is that it makes sense to do the kmap,
and the i/o in the bottom_half.  What is wrong with that?
kmap should be quick and fast because it is for transitory mappings.
It shouldn't be something whose overhead you are trying to avoid.
If kmap is that expensive then kmap needs to be fixed, instead
of your code working around a perceived problem.
At least that is what it looks like from here.
