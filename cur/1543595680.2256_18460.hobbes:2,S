I'm curious.  How does the caller of wake_up_sync know that the
current cpu will soon be idle.  Does it assume that there are no
other tasks on the runqueue waiting for a CPU?  If there are other
tasks on the runqueue, isn't it possible that another task has a
higher goodness value than the task being awakened.  In such a case,
isn't is possible that the awakened task could sit on the runqueue
(waiting for a CPU) while tasks with a lower goodness value are
allowed to run?
