Well, I'm not familiar with this problem, at least.
Can you provide info as described in REPORTING-BUGS (in the kernel tree)?
Can you define ATA_DEBUG and ATA_VERBOSE_DEBUG in 
include/linux/libata.h, and provide output when it deadlocks?
Did you try 2.6.9-rc1 snapshot?
If nothing else, can you record the bug at 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/
 
to make sure its not lost?
