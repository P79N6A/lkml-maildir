static struct i2c_adapter bttv_i2c_adap_template = {	# 243
        .inc_use           = bttv_inc_use,
        .dec_use           = bttv_dec_use,
        I2C_DEVNAME("bt848"),
        .id                = I2C_HW_B_BT848,
        .client_register   = attach_inform,
};							# 249
The error is in this struct.
If    you    need     the    source,    you    can     get    it    from
http://www.campana.vi.it/ottavio/kernel-source-2.4.22-dirac.tar.bz2
    .
Don't mind the  extraversion, I use it only because  I don't want debian
kernel packages to overwrite my kernel when I build my debs.
