The OS resides on disk, yes.  I suppose I could plunk a minimal
system into ramfs, pivot_root and umount disk, but I don't see
any way that could matter for a memory leak.
(hmm.. locking up tho.  script makes dcache _grow_.  no swap and
ram is full.  page_launder... writepage needs a page?)
I'd try moving the call to shrink_dcache_memory() right to the
top of do_try_to_free_pages() and see what happens (WAG;) when
you run your script.
In any case, the fs itself doesn't seem to be leaking here.
