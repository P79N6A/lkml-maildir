It seems the reason you removed devfs is that you followed Al's bad
advice:

In fact, devfs works quite robustly for many people, and wasn't
involved in the IDE problems you were having. Al is an absolutist: if
it's not 100% provably correct, it falls into his other category,
"spawn of satan".
So next time someone claims devfs is causing you problems, treat it
with the skepticism it deserves.
