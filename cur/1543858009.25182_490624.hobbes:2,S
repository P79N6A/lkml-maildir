Well, it's disabled by default... the option is there as a quick way
to fix "why is my bandwidth so low" when a broken BIOS sets these to
minimum values.  Maybe we should just strip out that code and point
people who want to tweak this at setpci instead.

Actually even PCIe might not be that easy.  For example with current
kernels on PowerPC 440SPe (SoC with PCIe), I just get:
    # lspci
    00:01.0 InfiniBand: Mellanox Technology: Unknown device 6274 (rev a0)
ie no host bridge / root complex.
