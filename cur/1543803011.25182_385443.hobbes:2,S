In the follow-ups to my above message, I found that it was actually
working, and dropped from 21W down to as low as 18W in some cases, but
USB and the input layer are firing off timers very regularly, so it
bounces around all over the place.

As soon as that usb timer hits (every 250ms iirc) you'll bounce back out
of any low-power state you may be in. It's a bit craptastic that we do
this, even if we don't have any USB devices plugged in.
