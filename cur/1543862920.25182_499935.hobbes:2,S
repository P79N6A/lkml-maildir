They are the commands passed into this macro (as arguments) to
release/take a lock.  This is a home-grown wait_on_event type macro
where the condition must be checked while holding a lock.  And the
commands passed in are themselves macros.  The jfs code could probably
be cleaned up a bit as far as excessive use of macros for locking, but
it's been working for a few years with few problems.
