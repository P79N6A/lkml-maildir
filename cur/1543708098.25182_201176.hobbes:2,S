I spoke too bloody soon.  The problem still exists, but on a lesser 
scale:
Feb 23 19:25:39 Linux233 kernel: nfs: server 486Linux not responding, 
still trying
Feb 23 19:25:41 Linux233 kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit 
timed out
Feb 23 19:25:41 Linux233 kernel: nfs: server 486Linux OK
Feb 23 19:28:27 Linux233 kernel: nfs: server 486Linux not responding, 
still trying
Feb 23 19:28:31 Linux233 kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth1: transmit 
timed out
Feb 23 19:28:31 Linux233 kernel: eth1: link up, 10Mbps, half-duplex, 
lpa 0x0000
Feb 23 19:28:35 Linux233 kernel: nfs: server 486Linux not responding, 
still trying
Feb 23 19:28:35 Linux233 kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit 
timed out
Feb 23 19:28:35 Linux233 kernel: nfs: server 486Linux OK
I lose 10 seconds on network when this happens, and eth0 going AWOL 
then seems to make eth1 go awol straight after.
The cards all work FINE on 2.6.2/1/0 (2.4.1.->.24)...  what has 
changed so much to cause this, so at least I can supply some info.
:/
