I configured two separate Subnets with routes for each of them. 
Each NIC had an address in its subnet. Each Subnet had its own Switch.
192.168.99.0   netmask 255.255.255.0
192.168.100.0 netmask 255.255.255.0

All requests were handled completly in its subnet. Analysis of the
processed requests show, that they were distributed more or less evenly.
