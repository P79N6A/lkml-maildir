You've touched on one of the main problems that spurs these kinds of
laws along through the system: People don't know about them or
understand them. Those of us that do know and understand them, and their
implications, need to speak up and explain them to those that do not.
Not doing so just gives those trying to push them through (and
succeeding) more power to do so. Those that draft, support, lobby, and
push for these kinds of laws often count on the fact that the public in
general is naive and are not paying enough attention to know what is
good and what is not good for them, or to even have a clue as to what is
going on on Capital Hill (or in Parliament, or wherever). They also rely
upon the Fear Factor.
The resent Anti Terrorism bills passed here in the U.S. were just
waiting for something to allow them to pass easily. Many of the policies
in these laws were drafted long before 9/11, and attempts were made to
make them law long before 9/11. Those attempts failed because either
people were aware of them each for what they were, or the law drafters
were not comfortable that they would pass. Along comes 9/11, and
suddenly people are more afraid of what would happen to them without a
new law (the Fear Factor), than what might happen with a new law. They
also did not pay much attention to the actual contents of the law
(herein lies the "not understanding, naive, not paying attention" part)
and allowed many concessions to to their freedom be made on the premise
of the government protecting them against terrorism. There are already
plenty of laws that would mandate a terrorist be prosecuted (or a
non-terrorist committing many of the crimes that were thrown into the
recent anti-terrorism laws), but it seems the powers that be just wanted
more control.
The bottom line is, to many too often sit and do nothing until they come
to realize it's too late to do anything other than the drastic. Is this
to be the trend when it comes to Open Source, including Linux? Maybe the
SSSCA or other laws will have no effect, but then maybe they will. I for
one do not wish to sit on my rear and wait to find out it (or they)
have.
