Well I am having a problem with ext2. I compiled it as a module (with
modversions). Then in a inital ram disk (romfs) I try to load ext2, but
fail. I think have have tracked to problem to that inode_generation_count
is define extern. But modversion is not picking it up!
Ok this may be way off but it is a though!
/lib/ext2.o: unresolved symbol(s)
        inode_generation_count
