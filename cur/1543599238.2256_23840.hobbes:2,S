Note: the whole point is to avoid having the readahead queue spill over, by 
throttling readahead.  So the readahead queue should only need to be culled 
due to a rise in page activations, enlarging the active list, and requiring 
the system to rebalance itself.  I don't think you can really talk about 
pressure being exerted on the inactive queue by the readahead queue.  The 
size of the inactive queue doesn't really matter as long as it isn't too 
short to provide a good test of short-term page activity.  (If it gets very 
long then it will automatically shorten itself because the probability of a 
given page on the queue being referenced and rescued goes up.)

Sure, there is an argument for stripping buffers immediately from culled 
readahead pages and moving them straight to the inactive_clean list instead 
of the inactive_dirty list.  In effect, culled readahead pages would then 
rank below aged-to-zero and used-once pages.  It's too subtle a difference 
for me to see any clear advantage one way or the other.  Doing it your way 
would save one queue-move in the lifetime of every culled readahead page.
