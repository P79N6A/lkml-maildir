OK, I'll add that and COBALT_28 to my list of dead symbols to be removed.
I'm working on patches to do that now.
Have you applied Steven Cole's version of my Configure.help patches
1-5 yet?  If not, would you prefer to see further incremental patches
or a consolidated config-namespace cleanup patch including both
help additions and dead-symbol removals?  I can do either; please let me
know which would make life easier for you.
(Intentionally, none of this is CML2 stuff.)
