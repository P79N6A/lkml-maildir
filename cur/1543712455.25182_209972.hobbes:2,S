Hi Andrew,
On a Thinkpad T40p, 2.6.5-rc2-mm4 does not boot successfully,
whereas 2.6.5-rc2 does.  All the typical things (ACPI, CPUFREQ, APIC
& IOAPIC, etc.) are built in.  The -mm4 kernel config was derived
from the working config for 2.6.5-rc2.  
I have to pass the nolapic kernel option to disable the local APIC
in order to successfully boot 2.6.x kernels.  It appears that with
2.6.5-rc2-mm4, this option is ignored, or perhaps there's a ordering
issue with when it is checked.  With -mm4, a message saying that it
is enabling the local APIC appears _before_ the "Kernel command
line: ... nolapic" line appears.
Without the -mm4 patch, the nolapic command line option is parsed
before it would have tried to reenable the local APIC.  With -mm4,
it is parsed after it tries to renable it.  Boom, and then it locks
on "Calibrating delay loop...".
Any relevant config options I should try with/without to help narrow
it down?
Thanks,
Dan
