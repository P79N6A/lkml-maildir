I've run it for 2^30 - the same result: folded and not folded Jenkins
hash behave the same and still both results produce exactly the same
artifacts compared to XOR hash.
Btw, XOR hash, as completely stateless, can be used to show how
Linux pseudo-random generator works for given subset - it's average of
distribution is very good.
