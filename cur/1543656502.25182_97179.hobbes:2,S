Sure, I can verify it.  The I/O APICs in shipped summit chipsets contains a 
version ID of 0x11 instead of 0x14 to 0x1F.  The high performance folks 
claimed that Intel specified 0x14 for the local APICs, but left their orange 
jacket docs saying 0x1X for I/O APICs until after the chips taped out.
Whatever.  In any case, there are boxes in the field that contain those 
version numbers.  We can recognize them using the OEM and product strings in 
the MPS and ACPI tables, so it's only an annoyance.
