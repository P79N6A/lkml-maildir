I was hoping this patch would help turn rumors into real data :)
If we did put min alignment into backing_dev_info, we could implement
the equivalent of bounce buffers for direct-io -- or just fall back
to buffer i/o like it does sometimes anyway.  That way application
would not break, just get worse performance on some hardware.
Right now I just wanted to get the issues on table, get some test
results, and see how to proceed from there.  Since this patch only
affects direct i/o, getting test results shouldn't cause too many
problems.
Thanks,
Daniel
