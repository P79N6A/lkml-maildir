Using the config_nonlinear model, you'd change the four mapping functions:
	logical_to_phys
	phys_to_logical
	pagenum_to_phys
	phys_to_pagenum
to use a hash table instead of a table lookup.  Bill Irwin suggested a btree
would work here as well.
(Note I'm trying out the term 'pagenum' instead of 'ordinal' here, following
comments on lse-tech.)
