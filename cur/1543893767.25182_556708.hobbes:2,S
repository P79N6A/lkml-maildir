I've come home to find my server has locked up hard, with a panic on the screen. 
  This time unlike others, I was able to grab a photo of it for further analysis.

I have had this or a very similar traceback appear about 3 or 4 times now, 
including with a 2.6.21-gentoo kernel (based on mainline), so this bug may well 
be present in mainline.  It is not new to this -mm release.
The bug does not occur on demand, it just seems to happen every few days without 
obvious warning, I haven't reported it until now as I haven't had any other 
information to provide other than "some panic seems to happen with a tty_write 
something-or-other".
The other possibly crucial piece of information on this is that I have one of my 
serial ports set up as a serial console.  The kernel boot commands for this are:
kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.22-rc4-mm2 ro real_root=/dev/md2 console=tty0 
console=ttyS0,57600 panic=30
as well as this:
# SERIAL CONSOLES
s0:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 57600 ttyS0 vt100
in inittab.
The other serial port is connected up to my APC UPS and is set up with apcupsd.
