I thought that first, too. I forgot to mention that I did a badblocks on 
the partitions and the two whole disks. No issues reported. I formated 
the disks several times and reinstalled the whole gentoo and compiled 
the kernel again more than one time (I tried 2.6.24-rc3 too) 'cause of 
the ext3 / other fs issues. I did dd if=/dev/zero of=... on the 
partitions and the whole disks. No issues of bad blocks. The strange 
thing is everything works fine under Windows XP x64 Prof. But I don't 
wanted to use that OS really... So I can't believe that's a hardware 
issue of the disks.
