I am not copying everybody here because I don't think they know.
I am sure Alan et all are quite aware that init, as the "father
of all other processes" has to have a PID of 1 to maintain SYS-V
compatibility. This means that whatever happens, init must not die. 
If you have an init that dies, it is broken. It is either miscompiled
or coded incorrectly.
Init also has to have a signal handler to get the return status
of children created by defective user programs so that, regardless
of how may broken programs are executed, you don't have a bunch
of zombies cluttering up process-slots.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
