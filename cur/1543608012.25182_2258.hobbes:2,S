Agreed.
It is still interesting to hear if it makes a big performance differece
under swap though. In particular it would be very nice to keep inodes
with pagecache in it out of the unused-inode-list, but it would need
additional bitkeeping in inode.c.
I'm also wondering why you dropped the early-cow for the write swapins,
just to avoid managing the anon pages in the lru in do_swap_page and to
have the logic only in once place? I kept the early-cow logic so I only
get 1 page fault for every write-swapped-in pages.
