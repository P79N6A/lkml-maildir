And the kernel still doesn't actually compile with this patch applied.  You
need to also apply light-weight-counters-counter-conversion.patch to make
page_alloc.c compile.  So either we break git-bisect or I fold two
inappropriate patches together or I need to patchwrangle it somehow.

Yes, I need to fold them all together.
And fix the unused-variable warnings.
