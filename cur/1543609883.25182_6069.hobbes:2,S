It sounds like the superblock claims to be an ext3 fs, but something
has scrogged the journal file.
e2fsck should have removed the journal in this situation, with
the message "*** ext3 journal has been deleted - filesystem is
now ext2 only ***".
Please send the output of dumpe2fs, and of `fsck -fy'.
Probably you can repair it by booting with `init=/bin/sh' and
running `tune2fs -O ^has-journal' agains the fs, and then fscking
it.
