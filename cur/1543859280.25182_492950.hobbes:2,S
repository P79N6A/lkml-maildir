Actually, no ... that just prevented breakage enabled by
commit cbd69dbbf1adfce6e048f15afc8629901ca9dae5 which taught
PCI how to use the new irqs-off suspend_late()/resume_early()
driver model calls.

In general, it still can; though not for PCI, because of the change
I pointed out above.  What the patch you mentioned changes is something
else:  it refuses to do so when those calls should require leaving
the system in an IRQs-off mode.
Rather obviously, IRQs-off is fine for entering system-wide suspend
states.  But Linux can't stay in that mode for normal operations ...

And the reason they couldn't be called is:  that they guarantee IRQs
would stay off between suspend_late() and resume_early().

Stop trying to use broken and deprecated APIs; and realize that "previously
working" meant you just hadn't tripped over the serious bugs yet.
Work with driver framework developers to come up with a solution for
the _real_ problem, which IMO will look more like "teach <x> stack about
power management" than "bypass all the driver layers and go right to a
PCI-specific mechanism, even for non-PCI drivers".

Drivers can and should know how to do that sort of stuff themselves,
so the power savings are reliable and consistent no matter what user
space tools are (or aren't) used.
Drivers know how to get power savings a lot better than any userspace
code ever could ... with the exception of hints like "ifdown eth0"
letting the driver know that right now is a good time to power down
almost everything, since it's not going to be used until "ifup".
(Agreed that other hints may be desirable, but that's a different
issue ... probably best addressed at the framework level, e.g. WLAN,
rather than by hacks to individual drivers.)

As a generic mechanism, that interface has *ALWAYS* been "broken
by design"; I'd call it unfixable.  It's deprecated, and scheduled
to vanish; see Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt ...
