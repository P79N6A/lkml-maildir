HZ = 1000 isn't a 2.4 thing.

Why waste 500nS every IDE command as opposed to doing the job right ? The initial
ndelay() is a quick implementation. If you don't like it implement a better one,
if your box isnt fast implement it as udelay.
In the 2.5 tree I also hope we can avoid the ndelay in some cases
