Subject: Re: [RFC][2.6.12.3] Use vectors 0x21-0x2F
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Quick and dirty patch to use the 16 vectors that appear to have
fallen through the cracks.  This also is useful for older CPUs that
have serial APICS:  P54C, P6, P2, P3, K5, K6, etc.  They can benefit
from the extra vector space to hash the IRQs.
I suppose I could have started at 0x20 instead of 0x21.  The extra
level probably would more than compensate for having to skip 0x80 on
the initial allocations.
