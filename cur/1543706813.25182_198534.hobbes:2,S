Well, it reminds me a disk I had problems with several years ago. It had
a few defects in the FAT area, which were relocated at the end. Performance
was terrible since the head had to move constantly. It took ages to install
Win31 on it, so it finally was returned to the vendor. But in your case it
seems a little bit different since you experience slow writes anywhere on
the medium. Would it be possible that your controller does something like
read-modify-write because of too big chunk size ?
