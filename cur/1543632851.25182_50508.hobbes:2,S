Hi again,
this patch changes a few lines in config.in/config.help.
So it should be easier to find support for SiS7012 onboard sound,
which is mainly build on SiS735/745 mainboards.
BIG NOTE:
This patch NEEDS the patch for i8x0 sound chipset driver, which isn't included in the 
vanilla kernel,
but it is included in the 2.5.20-dj2 patch set.
This patch is against 2.5.20-dj2
