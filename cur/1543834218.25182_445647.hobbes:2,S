Hello,
OpenBSD has sasyncd daemon to synchronize IPSEC keys between two or more
hosts that should act as failover gateways. I am wondering if it is
possible to do this with Linux.
There are IP_VS_PROTO_ESP and IP_VS_PROTO_AH configuration options which
claim to do "ESP and AH load balancing support". I am wondering what
does this exactly mean? I tried IPVS compiled with those options with
keepalived and it didn't seem to synchronize keys.
Maybe sasyncd should be ported to Linux?
