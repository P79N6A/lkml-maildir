That will be in the pagecache.

No. Most of your pagecache is unmapped pagecache. This would correspond
to memory that caches files which are not being mmapped by any process.
This could result from either the page replacement policy favoring
filesystem cache too heavily or from lots of io causing the filesystem
cache to be too bloated and so defeating the swapper's heuristics (you
can do this by generating large amounts of read() traffic).
Limiting unmapped pagecache would resolve your issue. Whether it's the
right thing to do is still open to question without some knowledge of
application behavior (for instance, teaching userspace to do fadvise()
may be right thing to do as opposed to the /proc/ tunable).
Can you gather traces of system calls being made by the applications?
