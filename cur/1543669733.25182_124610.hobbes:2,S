Hi,
Looking through the archive etc., I cannot see any references to pset 
functionality more recently than
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/9904.1/0521.html
announcing an updated patch in April 1999. Are there any plans out there to 
include this, or similar functionality in 2.5/2.6? I'm particularly interested 
in getting exclusive access to a CPU (plus or minus HT support, for now anyway).
Thanks, Shaheed
