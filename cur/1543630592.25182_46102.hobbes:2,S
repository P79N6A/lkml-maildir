I have uploaded common-2.4.18-7 and common-2.5.15-4 to sourceforge.
http://sourceforge.net/projects/kbuild/,
 package kbuild-2.5, download
release 2.4.  This cross syncs the 2.4.18 and 2.5.15 architecture
independent code, where the two kernels have similar requirements.  I
will take Tom Duffy's 2.4.19-pre8 patch, add it to common-2.4.18-7 and
issue common-2.4.19-pre8-1 tomorrow.
