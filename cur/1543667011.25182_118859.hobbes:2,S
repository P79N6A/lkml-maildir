I am not sure I understand the question, but if I do
the answer is "nowhere", there is no conversion
(other than the lengthening that happens when one
casts an unsigned short to an unsigned int).
For dev_t (8,1) is 0x00000801, but (8,256) is 0x00080100.
(In case of a 16+16 split. Not that I advocate that,
it is just easy talking.)
For kdev_t (8,1) is 0x00080001 and (8,256) is 0x00080100.
So kdev_t allows simple fast composition and decomposition,
but is restricted to the kernel.
While dev_t requires a conditional, since it has to remain
compatible with the old 8+8 userspace.

You do not mean using mknod?
