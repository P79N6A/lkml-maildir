   so 32bits plateforms doesnt use the same fs format than 64bits ones?
   you mean that a disc with a ext2fs formated on alpha cant be read on 
   a x86 ?
No, the formats are compatible; but if you create a large file (i.e.,
greater than 2GB on an Alpha platform), you can only mount the
filesystem read-only on an i386 platform (to avoid the possibility of
damaging the large file).  
If you delete the large file, and then run e2fsck on the filesystem, it
will clear the "this filesystem has large files on it" flag, and you
will again be able to mount the filesystem read/write on a 32 bit
platform.
