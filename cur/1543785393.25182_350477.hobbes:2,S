The debian installer has devfs paths coded into it, ok, sure.  The  
reason it used devfs was so it didn't need extra userspace stuff to  
create device nodes.  It seems like the installer could be reasonably  
easily converted to use different path names without changing any  
_real_ code at all, and from there all you need to do is add the  
ndevfs patch to the kernel.  It's probably about as difficult to add  
the udev userspace stuff at the right point in the boot process (you  
still need to change all the pathnames), as it is to add the ndevfs  
patch to the kernel.  On the other hand, the latter _might_ result in  
a smaller floppy image, which is what the Debian developers really  
wanted/needed.  I suppose it would be nice if the busybox people  
added basic udev-type functionality, but it's not really all that  
necessary.
Cheers,
