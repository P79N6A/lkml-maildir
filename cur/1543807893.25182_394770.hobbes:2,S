Vague 'cos I do not know where the problem is.  One might say slowdown 
is like a near a 1ms delay per line output, but slowdown does not 
correlate to kernel tick frequency.  :(

Perhaps, I've yet to try that.

Yes, the gross datapoints such as basic net i/o, disk i/o, say 2.6 is 
better/faster than 2.4 on this hardware, my problem is how to describe 
measured console slowdown in terms meaningful to you. 
I'll take a look at oprofile, report back if I can make sense of it ;)
