Hi,
Sorry for the late response ... 
I'm reading the patch, and I'm wondering what about performance and
overhead.   Here's the code that concerns me:
On Wed, Jul 06, 2005 at 02:04:14PM +0900, Hidetoshi Seto was heard to remark:

Are you assuming that a device driver will use an iochk_read() for
every DMA operation? for every MMIO to the card?  
For high performance devices, it seems to me that this will cause
a rather large performance burden, especially if its envisioned that
all architectures will do something similar.
My concern is that (at least on ppc64) the call pci_read_config_word()
requires a call into "firmware" aka "BIOS", which takes thousands upon
thousands of cpu cycles.  There are hundreds of cycles of gratuitous
crud just to get into the firmware, and then lord-knows-what the
firmware does while its in there; probably doing all sorts of crazy
math to compute bus addresses and other arcane things.  I would imagine
that most architectures, includig ia64, are similar.
Thus, one wouldn't want to perform an iochk_read() in this way unless
one was already pretty sure that an error had already occured ... 
Am I misunderstanding something?
