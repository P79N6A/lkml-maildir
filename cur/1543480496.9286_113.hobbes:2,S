[sent to kernel list since scsi doesn't appear to have a maintainer,
and CC'd to lnz in case it's a Buslogic issue]
I have the following SCSI devices all connected via a BT-958:
Attached devices: 
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00
  Vendor: MICROP   Model: 4743             Rev: S150
  Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 01 Lun: 00
  Vendor: QUANTUM  Model: FIREBALL ST2.1S  Rev: 0F0M
  Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 02 Lun: 00
  Vendor: IBM      Model: DDRS-34560D      Rev: DC1B
  Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Under kernel 2.1.131 (and 2.0.x):
Queue depths: 10,7,28:
everything works fine
Queue depths: 10,28,28:
The second drive gets resets every few seconds, until TQ is disabled
then things are smooth
Under kernel 2.2.0-pre7-ac7:
Queue depths: 10,7,28:
The first drive gets into a continuous loop of SCSI resets, even after
TQ is disabled, and you get 'can't read inode' errors on the root partition.
hardware reset requred. 
Queue depths: Disabled,28,28:
Everything works fine. Performance of the second drive is noticably better. 
I know the second drive is a POS, though the first drive seems to be worse. 
However, Linux does need to have a better mode of failure than continuous
bus resets. 
The 'obvious' solution would be to blacklist the Micropolis drive,
as that seems to make the bus extremely stable, as well as make the
Quantum Fireball ST behave. 
However, the change below doesn't appear to do anything. 
BusLogic=TQ:N does fix the problem however.

P.S. Any new drives will all be IBM.
