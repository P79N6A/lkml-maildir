How do you deal with the subbufs_consumed and subbufs_produced
counter overflows?
It goes in pair with my other question about which of relay or GTSC must
do the locking here. You seem to use a size_t for the produced and
consumed counts, which implies that you have to provide external
protection against racy modification of these 64 bits offsets by the
tracer and that in no way you can do an atomic update on a 32 bits
architecture. Therefore, either you have problems with reentrancy and
can run a long time before it overflows, or you use atomic_t or local_t
types and have to deal with overflows, which will happen more often.
