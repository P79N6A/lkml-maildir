What are these patches against? I released a bunch of patches to swsusp
and pmdisk two weeks ago. I'm not sure if Andrew has picked them up yet.
It would be nice if you would patch against those.

I don't understand - have you really tested it or just compile-tested it?
If not, please do try it out for real. There is no reason to be scared of
swsusp, and the more people that use it, the more stable it will get.
