Hi,
I'm turning towards you because our team needs open-minded people, 
who are not afraid of earning a lot of money and who are
prepared to venture a couple of hours per week for that
reason. If you qualify, then please visit our web site and
grab your free member #id.

And now something really special!
We got our hands on 10 pairs of promotional round trip plane tickets
and we will give them to the next 10 people who join the team.
These tickets can be used to fly to just about anywhere and have
a value of up to $1600! Just join the team, right now, upgrade to VIP, 
which  will cost you $49.95, and we'll pick up
the plane ticket tab for your next trip to Hawaii!
