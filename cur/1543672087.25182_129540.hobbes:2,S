This looks like a timer fix that happens to be in network
code, not a network fix.  Judging from the others he just
posted he is fixing/upgrading timer code.
He only CC'd the kernel list.  The bug was sent to
davej@codemonkey.org.uk.  You are askiing him to filter
every piddly fix to identify which group it should go to.
I sypmathize with your position but i think you are setting
up too high a barrier.  When multiple poeple repeat the same
mistake it is called a systems problem and you fix the
system.
It strikes me that a filter subscribed to lkml could examine
the postings for lines like:
--- linux-2.5.68/net/sched/sch_cbq.c    2003-03-25 10:08:36.000000000 +0530
+++ linux-2.5.68-nvk/net/sched/sch_cbq.c        2003-05-03 19:29:08.000000000 +0530
and if present recognize "this is for the network list" and
send them there if the networking list isn't already
specified as a destination.  Such functionality, once
created, could be expanded for other lists or individuals
that want it.
