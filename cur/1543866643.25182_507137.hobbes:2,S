Hmm.  If uptime is critical I would make sure to have redundant
systems anyway and I would just reboot the thing.  I would not expect
the suspend/resume paths on server class hardware like 10gig ethernet,
Infiniband adapters, or high end SCSI to be particularly well tested.

Yes but for such hardware, suspend/resume is likely to be a lot of
work to implement, and I'd rather the developers devote those
resources to making the driver as stable and performant as possible.
I agree 100% that drivers for desktop and laptop hardware should be
rejected if missing suspend/resume.
