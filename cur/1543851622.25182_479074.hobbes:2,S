Also could we see the section of System.map that deals with
per cpu variables.
I believe there are some counters for processes and the like
just below kstat whose size increase is causing you real
problems.
Ugh.  I just looked at include/linux/kernel_stat.h
kstat has the per cpu irq counters and all of the cpu process
time accounting so it is quite likely that we are going to be
touching this structure plus the run queues and the process counts
during a fork.  All of which are now potentially much more spread out.
Also has anyone else reproduce this problem yet?
I don't doubt that it exists but having a few more data points or
eyeballs on the problem couldn't hurt.
