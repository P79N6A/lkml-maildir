It's not clear that the problem _can_ be solved in user space.
It's easy enough to say "never allocate more than a page". But it's often 
not REALISTIC.
Very basic issue: the perfect is the enemy of the good. Claiming that 
there is a "proper solution" is usually a total red herring. Quite often 
there isn't, and the "paper over" is actually not papering over, it's 
quite possibly the best solution there is.
