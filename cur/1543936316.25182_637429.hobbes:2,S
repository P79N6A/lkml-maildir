"Regression" sounds like a test suite to me, verifying that the
old problems didn't come back. Maybe you could send me a pointer?
Of course I didn't try that much yet. The kernel booted as expected,
I saw XWindow running, the mouse pointer was moving, etc. There was
just no sound, as before with rc7.

Speaker and first headphone are the same on this laptop. If I plugin
the headphone, then the tiny speakers are disconnected. But for the
last tests no headphone was plugged in.
I tested it by running gnome-alsamixer. I tried to switch off and
on the mute buttons, change the volume and other sliders, etc.

I will try tomorrow. What exactly is this delay good for?

AFAICS I did use the mm branch. The command to grab the sources was
git-clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/perex/alsa.git mm
Is this correct?
