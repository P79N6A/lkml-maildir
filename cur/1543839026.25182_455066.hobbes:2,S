No.  We make it unavailable for write caching so it is available for
other important things like cached clean pages and executables etc.
You have to start throttling some where or you get very bad
behaviour.  40% seems a good number, but it is tunable.
The fact that it helps with receive starvation is just s bonus.

That is a very good question.  Is memlocked memory throttled against
dirty pages, and does it decrease the space available to the 40%
calculation?  I don't know.  I guess I could look at the code...
get_dirty_limits in page_writeback caps 'dirty_ratio' (40 by default,
hence the 40%) at unmapped_ratio/2.
So yes.  If 68% is mapped and locked (I assume that it the situation
you are referring to) that leaves 32% unlocked, so the 40% above is
reduced to 16% and you should still have 160Meg of breathing space.
