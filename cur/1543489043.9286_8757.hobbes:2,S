For example,
[1] if sender doesn't get an ack soon enough, it will retransmit the
original packet.
[2] if multiple packets are in flight (which happens on fast paths with
lots of delay) an ack on a later packet means that everything up through
that packet has been received.
Thing is, with lots of short sessions between the same two machines,
it would be nice to implement a protocol change so that later sessions
could take advantage of stuff learned in earlier sessions.  But I don't
think anyone would think this is a linux 2.2 issue.
