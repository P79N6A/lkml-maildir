Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Use 64-bit inode numbers internally in the kernel [try #2]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

These patches make the kernel pass 64-bit inode numbers internally when
communicating to userspace, even on a 32-bit system.  They are required
because some filesystems have intrinsic 64-bit inode numbers: NFS3+ and XFS
for example.  The 64-bit inode numbers are then propagated to userspace
automatically where the arch supports it.
Problems have been seen with userspace (eg: ld.so) using the 64-bit inode
number returned by stat64() or getdents64() to differentiate files, and failing
because the 64-bit inode number space was compressed to 32-bits, and so
overlaps occur.
There are two patches:
 (1) Make struct kstat::ino and filldir_t's inode number argument u64 rather
     than ino_t and give an EOVERFLOW if an inode number can't be represented
     to userspace without shedding the top bits of the number.
 (2) Make NFS represent 64-bit fileids as 64-bit inode numbers to the VFS
     rather than compressing them to 32-bits on 32-bit systems.
