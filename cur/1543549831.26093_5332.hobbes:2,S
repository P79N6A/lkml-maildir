An ENOMEM is not spurious if there is not enough memory. UNIX does not ask the
OS to do impossible tricks.

I think you are solving the wrong problem. On a small memory machine, the kernel,
utilities, and applications should be configured to use little memory.  
BusyBox is better than BeanCount.

What we need is simple kernel code that does not hold resources
into a  possible deadlock situation.

On general principles, I don't see any substitute for clean code in the kernel and
my prediction is that if you show me an example of 
DoS vulnerability,  I can show you fix that does not require bean counting.
Am I wrong?
