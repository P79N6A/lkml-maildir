I used the hint from Ajay Patel and found that in my 'installed' glibc 
on my host 'linuxthreads' was being
used. However, I did compile glibc-2.3.5 for the host and results from 
that indicate that the nptl threads
version is begin used.
I will see if 1) the Gentoo distribution which was installed on the host 
machine I'm using has an updated
version of everything to the nptl threads, or 2) compile gdb against the 
glibc-2.3.5 which has the
ntpl threads.
Also, I'm using a 2.6.5 kernel in my host development environment, and 
using a 2.6.11.6 kernel
in my target. The target is actually using uClibc, and so I will check 
for the type of threads package
that is being supported there as well.
Thanks
