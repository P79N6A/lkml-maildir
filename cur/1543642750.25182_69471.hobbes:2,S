There's actually not a lot there, and what is there is not random, but
rather a rapidly fading "ghost" of what was there last. And for most
folks, this gets wiped by POST or the kernel long before the RNG gets
its hands on it.
Nonetheless, there's no reason not to take whatever state we get when
we allocate our pool. Amusingly, the current code needlessly zeroes out
its pool before using it - twice! I've already fixed this in my patches.
