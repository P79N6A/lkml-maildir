Which is +/- dealt with in open firmware by also having a "compatible"
property that contain a list of names which this device is compatible with.
The "type" and "class" proper says if you are dealing with a bridge, a disk,
a serial port, etc... (but we could refine that into separate types/subtypes,
like a serial port beeing a type "char device" and subtype "serial port")
The compatible says which what kind of HW you are compatible with (it's
a list), which can be the name of other HW, but can also be generic types.
One example is NE2k compatible cards. They can have a specific name, a type
of "ethernet adapter" (or just ethernet to make things simple) a class
of "network device" and compatible "ne2k".
The "compatible" isn't exactly relative to the kind of service you provide,
this is the job of "device_type" and "class", at least in OF world, but
more the kind of HW you are compatible with (to help pick the proper
driver), though that don't necessarily make sense in driverfs. It's just
that the idea could be reused.

Well, I have a bunch of real needs for it easily available ;) But in lots
of case, I beleive slowly replacing most ioctl's in drivers with that would
make sense. I _think_ Patrick and I agree on that, and It's something I want
to discuss at OLS/KS, probably as part of the Power Management BOF.
