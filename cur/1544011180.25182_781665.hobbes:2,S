I'll have a look.

The whole patchset?  The bulk of the changes to lib/swiotlb.c are 
relatively minor to remove the unwarranted assumptions it is making in 
the face of a new user.  They will have no effect on other existing 
users, including non-Xen x86 builds.
If you have specific objections we can discuss those, but I don't think 
there's anything fundamentally wrong with making lib/swiotlb.c a bit 
more generically useful.

If the architecture doesn't support highmem then this code will compile 
to nothing - PageHighMem() will always evaluate to 0.  It will therefore 
have zero effect on the code generated for IA64 or x86-64.  This is not 
really a Xen-specific change, but a result of adding swiotlb support for 
i386.  Other architectures which support a notion of highmem would also 
need this code if they wanted to use swiotlb.
