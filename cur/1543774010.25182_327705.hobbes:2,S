Sorry if this question is dumb.
I use the link management functions  defined in list.h to setup my
links in user programs. but when I tried to migrate those programs to
Solaris on Sun workstations, I don't know how to define the function
prefetch, which is arch dependent.
Anyone know to do this? 
Thanks in advance!
