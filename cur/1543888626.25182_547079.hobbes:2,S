Well... in strict overcommit mode (overcommit_memory=2) this is the only way to
track down problems of the (bad-designed) user applications that exit when they
receive a -ENOMEM without logging anything... and, anyway, it could be an
additional aid in figuring out what is going wrong on inside a system. BTW, I
don't think it should be enabled by default, so this is the reason why it should
depend on print_fatal_signals patch.
