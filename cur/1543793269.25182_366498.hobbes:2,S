Debian 3.1 still ships a gcc 2.95, but the default compiler is gcc 3.3 .
Even Debian 3.0 (released in July 2002 and not supporting kernel 2.6) 
ships a gcc 3.0.4 (although it isn't the default compiler on !hppa).
Considering that kernel 2.6.0 was released two and a half years _after_ 
gcc 3.0, I do heavily doubt that there is any distribution that does 
both support kernel 2.6 and not ship any gcc >= 3.0 .
