Actually I did some more tests: 
test program
main()
{
	unsigned int i[4], o[4]; 
	i[0] = 1; i[1] = 2; i[2] = 3; i[3] = 4;
	asm("movups %1,%%xmm1 ; fninit ; movups %%xmm1,%0" : "=m" (o) : "m" (i)); 
	printf("%x %x %x %x\n",o[0],o[1],o[2],o[3]);
	asm("movups %1,%%xmm1 ; movups %%xmm1,%0" : "=m" (o) : "m" (i)); 
	printf("%x %x %x %x\n",o[0],o[1],o[2],o[3]);
}
Result on a pentium4: 
./xmm
bffff68c 8048431 8049640 8049660
bffff68c bffff68c bffff68c 8048431
So fninit seems to change something in XMM1. 
and pentium 3: 
bffff81c 8048431 8049640 8049660
bffff81c bffff81c bffff81c 8048431
changes something different ? 
If even Intel cannot agree on this it is probably safest to do an explicit
zeroing like Andrea's patch does. I retract the origina suggestion.
