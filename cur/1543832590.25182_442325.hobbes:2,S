Tried that, but failed with:
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
net/built-in.o: In function `dev_change_name':
: undefined reference to `class_device_rename'
Not sure whether that's an unclean patch reversal because of conflicts
with other patches (had a few "fuzz" and "offset" messages during the
patch -R), will have a look tomorrow.
