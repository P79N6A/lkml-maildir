Hi,
After 28 days of uptime on a 2.6.18 kernel I got a mysterious lockup. When I 
went to look at the screen the only debug that made it was:
BUG: soft lockup detected on CPU#0!
The cursor had frozen and the kernel would not respond to magic sysrq.
Anybody else seen this? I had 30+ days uptime with 2.6.17..
