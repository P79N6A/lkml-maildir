This changes the ABI for signals and ptrace() and that seems like
a bad idea to me.
And the way things are done now is so ingrained into the i386
kernel that I'm not sure it can be done.  E.g. I found two
open-coded implementations of current, one in kernel_fpu_begin()
and one in math_state_restore().

Can you describe what it is about the way things work now that
prevents dynamic allocation?
