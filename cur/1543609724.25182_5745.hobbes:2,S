The same could be said of any mail server that isn't RAID at
the very least. Oh, let's demand an off-site backup before
returning an OK status to the sender, and one of those S/390
processors that runs two pipelines in lock-step to detect
errors in the CPU. Swat the very last kernel bug too BTW.
Really, this isn't a big deal. Maybe it wasn't the best choice.
The drive probably lies to the OS anyway, so get over it.
