Then the patch must be broken coz this is what I have:

INSTALL_PATH=/boot
Further up the Makefile it does have this though
export  VERSION PATCHLEVEL SUBLEVEL EXTRAVERSION KERNELRELEASE ARCH \
        CONFIG_SHELL TOPDIR HPATH HOSTCC HOSTCFLAGS CROSS_COMPILE AS LD CC \
        CPP AR NM STRIP OBJCOPY OBJDUMP MAKE MAKEFILES GENKSYMS MODFLAGS PERL
I fixed the problem by adding INSTALL_PATH to the above. 
Cheers,
