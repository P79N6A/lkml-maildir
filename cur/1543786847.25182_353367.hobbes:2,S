Hi,
I have ported my USB driver on from Linux Kernel 2.4.20-8 to 2.6.11.12.
As a part of this porting process, I have replaced the bottom halves
with work_queues. Now, I am facing problems in the driver execution.
:-(.
The schedule_work() function which schedules the work is returning
FAILURE (0) many times (at least 1 out of 4 times it is called).
My queries:
1. When a work is queued using schedule_work (), does the function (that
is to be called as bottom half) run at process context OR Interrupt
context - The reason why I am getting confused is that in this called
function, if I print the return value of in_interrupt (), I get 0 (which
means that is running at process context), However, if I print the value
of in_interrupt after I have acquired a spin lock in this function, I
get the value 256 (which means I am running in interrupt context) ?
2. Why is the schedule_work () function failing. - I can't use
flush_workqueue in interrupt context, so is there any way; I can force
the work in the work queue to be scheduled.
Best Regards
Ravi
