Have you done any kind of variations on this configuration to see when
or where the maximum throughput happens?  Daniel and I were speculating
about where the 3ware limits are.  Specs say 100MB/s per adapter (for
both 6000 and 7000 series), you would probably hit max bandwidth with
2 adapters.  The drives themselves are not a limiting factor, unless
you are down to striping across only 2 drives instead of all 8.  I take
it you are using the hardware RAID instead of software MD RAID?

Does this board have multiple PCI busses?  Is the GigE card on a
different bus than the 3ware cards?
