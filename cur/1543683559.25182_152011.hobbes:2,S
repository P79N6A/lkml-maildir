But using strncpy() is _also_ wrong because of its NUL-padding behaviour.
There's really four different situations and strncpy is only suitable
for one of them:
a) Copy at most n bytes of a string to another string (strlcpy)
b) Copy at most n bytes from a character array into a string (strncat?)
c) Copy at most n bytes from a string to a character array that will
   be returned to user space (strncpy)
d) Copy n bytes from one character array to another (memcpy)
stpcpy is another interesting variant on the awful strcpy, but we'd need
a stpncpy too.  strncat is a little dubious for case (b) since you need
to initialise the dest with a NUL in the first byte.
C's string handling sucks, and everybody knows it.  Making strings a first
class object may be a cure worse than the disease (for the intended use
of C; for scripting languages it makes perfect sense).
