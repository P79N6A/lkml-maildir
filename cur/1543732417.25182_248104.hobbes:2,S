Wow, great stuff.  Thanks a lot for taking the time to try this out.
Also thanks for the original suggestion -- the more I think about the
private filesystem idea the more I like it.
Do you think simple_transaction_llseek() should be merged upstream?
It would definitely make the simple_transaction stuff more useful for
my application.
Thanks,
  Roland
