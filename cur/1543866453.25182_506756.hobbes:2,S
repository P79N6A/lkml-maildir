That's still got a deadlock, and also it doesn't work if we want to lock
the page when performing a minor fault (which I want to fix fault vs
invalidate), and also assumes nobody's ->nopage locks the page or
requires any resources that are held by prepare_write (something not
immediately clear to me with the cluster filesystems, at least).
But that all becomes legacy path, so do we really care? Supposing fs
maintainers like perform_write, then after the main ones have implementations
we could switch over to the slow-but-correct prepare_write legacy path.
Or we could leave it, or we could use Linus's slightly-less-buggy scheme...
by that point I expect I'd be sick of arguing about it ;)
