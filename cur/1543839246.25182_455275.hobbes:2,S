we'll change these EDEBs to a wrapper around dev_err, dev_dbg and dev_warn
as it's done in the mthca driver.
All EDEB_EN and EDEB_EX will be removed, that type of tracing can be done
if needed by kprobes.
There are a few cases where we won't get to a dev, for these few places
we'll use a simple wrapper around printk, as done in ipoib.
Hope that's the "official" way how to implement it in ib drivers.
