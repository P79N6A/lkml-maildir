Oh, now I see it. The set_cpus_allowed that was inside the preempt stuff
I was adding. (that the diff elided).  Yeah, that's a problem. Bugger.

This whole file is going away in .22, and we have a viable alternative in
.21 (acpi-cpufreq), so I'm not overly worried about fixing this up
given it only shows up in debug kernels, especially at this stage in -rc.
(Yeah, it's a cop-out, but unless someone with more interest in this problem
 steps up, I've bigger fishes to fry).
