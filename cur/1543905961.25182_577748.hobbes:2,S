Hey Ingo,
	I sent this fix for this back in the 2.6.21-rt9 era, and I thought to
picked it up, but I think it arrived amid some futex churn and
apparently has been dropped or was just lost.
Some of our testers have been reporting futex deadlocks and this fix
resolves it, so I believe it to still be needed.
thanks

Avoid futex_unlock_pi returning -EFAULT (which results in deadlock), by
clearing uval before jumping to retry_locked.
