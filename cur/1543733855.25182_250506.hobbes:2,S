They aren't world readable when using a security module like SELinux;
they are then typically only accessible by processes in the same
security domain, aside from processes in privileged domains. 
security_task_to_inode() hook sets the security attributes on the
/proc/pid inodes based on their security context, and then
security_inode_permission() hook controls access to them.  So you need
at least comparable controls.
