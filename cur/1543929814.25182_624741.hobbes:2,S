No, I think print_hex_dump() is too low-level to be doing allocations. 
For example, one could easily choose to call print_hex_dump() at oops time,
and then what happens if we oops in kmalloc() (as we often do...)?
You could trim linebuf[] to 80 chars or so.  Extra points for making it
very clear when someone tries to exceed that - strcpy(linebuf, "stop being
stupid").
