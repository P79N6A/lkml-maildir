It could be fixed but I only tested with 64 bit. Jens's report shows that 
my skepticism was justified. 32 bit has only small memory and suffers from 
VM crappiness due to highmem, bouncing due to dma zones etc etc. Its a big 
mess that I would like to avoid dealing with for now. Lots of corner cases 
that need consideration. When we actually merge this then we can deal with 
all the cases. If some cases cannot be dealt with then the large blocksize 
support will not be available if another particular feature is 
enabled.

Sounds good.
