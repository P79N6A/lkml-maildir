Most memberships internally construct such a fixed starting point from
voting or other 'chatty' techniques.
This is exposed by the membership (providing all nodes in the same order
on all nodes), however the node level membership does not necessarily
reflect the service/application level membership. So to get it right,
you essentially have to run such an algorithm at that level again too.
True enough it would be helpful if the group membership service provided
such, but here we're at the node level.

The oldest node might not be running that particular service, or it
might not be healthy. To figure that out, you need to vote.
This is straying a bit from LKML issues, maybe it ought to be moved to
one of the clustering lists.
