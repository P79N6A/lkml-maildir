Sorry for being way offtopic, but the above message reminded me
of commit 869659a6 from git.git repository, also this message:
    
http://www.gelato.unsw.edu.au/archives/git/0607/24208.html
By the way, Linus, please let me know if you get this message
via vger but not via the direct path to you.  I seem to have
been getting bounces for mails to you and andrew from my ISP in
the past few weeks.
