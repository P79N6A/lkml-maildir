I did - obviously not very well, but that doesnae mean it went
untested...
In addition, I can clearly state that it was sent to Linus because it
was developed for him at HIS request - that part of the config files
holds little interest to me, and I wouldnae have looked at it had not
Linus and Alan referred to problems with it...

Would you have handy a list of the "features that no other Config.in
file uses" that you refer to? I don't...

I have to admit that I hadn't noticed that - when I tried it out on my
system and examined the resultant .config file from "make menuconfig",
it looked correct, so I obviously overlooked something here...
I've just rechecked, and as you state, it doesn't work! Sorry.

About 20 minutes was spent testing it, but I somehow managed to
overlook that particular fault...for which I apologise...

I'm looking at the said comments in another window on my x-screen
right now, and I have to admit to defeat in finding the documentation
you refer to.
The only one that bears any relation to this point would appear to be
the comment dated 131197, which basically states that a line of output
is produced for each of the options in a choice list. I had assumed
such to be the case, with the usual "option=y" for the selected
option, and comments for the remaining options, and I see this is
indeed the case in the .config file produced. As a result, it implies
that the -n construct I used SHOULD work, although quite obviously it
doesn't...

Nods...and thanks for clearing up my misunderstanding of how that
works...
For reference, a corrected version thereof is enclosed with this
email...perhaps you could check this one out and advise whether it
works or not?
Best wishes from Riley.

-PCI direct access support
-CONFIG_PCI_DIRECT
-  If you don't want to use the PCI BIOS (e.g., because you run some
-  embedded system with no BIOS at all) or Linux says it cannot use
-  your PCI BIOS, you can enable direct PCI hardware here. It might
-  fail if your machine is based on some unusual chipset, but it

-  the use of BIOS is preferred. If unsure, say Y.
+PCI access support
+CONFIG_PCI_GOBIOS
+  If you have enabled PCI bus support above, Linux needs to determine
+  what PCI devices you have, and how they are configured. This setting
+  deals with how Linux should do that.
+
+  Within the kernel, two separate options are used to enable the two
+  possible ways Linux has for determining this. They are as follows:
+
+  CONFIG_PCI_BIOS
+      This says to allow Linux to use your PCI BIOS to detect the PCI
+      devices and determine their configuration. Note that some old
+      PCI motherboards have BIOS bugs and may crash if this mode is
+      selected.
+
+  CONFIG_PCI_DIRECT
+      This says that Linux should enable direct hardware support for
+      detecting PCI devices and determining their configuration. It
+      might fail if your machine is based on some unusual chipset,
+      but it usually works.
+
+  This setting is used to determine the valid combinations of the
+  above two options, since at least one of them MUST be selected. The
+  available choices are as follows:
+
+  BIOS    This enables the CONFIG_PCI_BIOS option only.
+  Direct  This enables the CONFIG_PCI_DIRECT option only.
+  Any     This enables both options.
+
+  If you are using Linux on some embedded system with no BIOS, or
+  Linux says it cannot use your BIOS, you should select DIRECT here,
+  otherwise you should probably select ANY here. Select BIOS only if
+  you have an unusual chipset for which DIRECT doesn't work.
 
 PCI quirks
 CONFIG_PCI_QUIRKS
   If you have a broken BIOS, it may fail to set up the PCI bus in a
   correct or optimal fashion. Saying Y here will correct that problem.
