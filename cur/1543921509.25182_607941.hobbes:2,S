Yes, userspace would need quite some overhead/syncronization/locking tricks to get it right.
That's basically one of the reasons I prefer the in-kernel solution.
The other reason is, that due to reduced code size compared to user-space, it's even a nice and clean solution for embedded devices.

Ok, I'll add that to the next version of the patch.
Do you have a suggestion how to realize that ?
I currently see two possibilities:
a) reading: userspace reads /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid_time and parses/stores the clock sequence number.
    writing: just echo a value to /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid_time, kernel will use this value then as new clock sequence number.
b) add a new sysfs entry, e.g. /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid_time_clockseq, to read/write the current/new value
Possibility b) is probably the cleaner solution, although it adds some more code.
What's your opinion ?

Yuk. If you really want, I'll add that hal event...

Yes, IMHO this seems unavoidable. 
Basically even the user-space implementation gets the lock. It's just indirect and less efficient.

Agreed.

Me neither.

Yes, I'll do that in the next version of the patch.

When I wrote that, I thought the same and my first idea was just to move the if clause before the #endif, e.g. like this:
	if (unlikely(!netdev_found))
	#endif /* CONFIG_NET */
	{ ....
But I didn't like that code folding very much.
On the other side, if CONFIG_NET is undefined, netdev_found still stays at "0", and the compiler should
convert that directly to 
	if (unlikely(!0)) {
	/* use bootid's nodeID if no network interface found */
and just drop the if() and thus the unlikely() statement.
So I think the compiler will just optimize it away and ignore the unlikely (because as it knows, it's not unlikely any more).

I'm not sure if this gains much. Probably the jumps will just be at some other place or the code will become more complex.
MAC/NodeID changes quite seldom. And if it changes, the machine will be quite busy anyway, e.g. configure IP addresses/DHCP, ...
But anyway, I'll give it a try for the next patch.
