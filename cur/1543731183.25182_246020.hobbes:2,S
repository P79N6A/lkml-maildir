Hans would be ready to write a conversion tool if you sponsor him ;-)
Anyway Hans wrote once, that future format changes in reiser4 should
be feasible by using a specially written "plugin" for that. (please
refer to the thread about plugins for details, people argue about
the terminology here)
>> the reiser4 have any critical bug?? anyone recommend this update???
Do not use it yet on important data. Please experiment though on data
you do not really value that much.
I have read a report that reiser4 has a problem with apache
trying to access .htaccess. Something about reiser4 giving a
misleading answer to a stat() call or something in that manner.
Subscribing to Reiserfs Mailinglist <reiserfs-list@namesys.com>
is also valueable of course.
There truly is a need for a glossary of terms and I belive Hans
and his crew know that the community needs proper documents
so that we all can grasp the whole idea behind reiser4 but
without so called "Hans Talk".
Regards,
Maciej
