you cannot do that without the (written) permission of all contributors,
which makes that severly impractical.
However, if those headers are strictly datastructures, your library
compiled against those does not contain code from those headers, eg it's
just interface definitions. Eg as long as you don't use inlines or large
#define's that generate code you're basically ok afaics (but IANAL). 
Now if you want to (re)distribute those headers with your package, the
GPL again applies to the files of course.
