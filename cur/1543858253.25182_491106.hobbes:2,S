Near as I could ever tell from the discussion on linux-mm, it is a page
which should not be dumped.  If you have a normal page in a mapping
which you don't want swapped out, the only way I could ever figure to
prevent that from happening is by doing an extra get_user_page() on it
to add a reference.
Thanks,
Robin
