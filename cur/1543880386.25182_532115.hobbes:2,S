Does it matter that google's recent report on disk failures indicated
that SMART never predicted anything useful as far as they could tell?
Certainly none of my drive failures ever had SMART make any kind of
indication that anything was wrong.
I think the main benefit of MD raid, is that it is portable, doesn't
lock you into a specific piece of hardware, and you can span multiple
controllers, and it is likely easier to have bugs in MD raid fixed that
in some raid controller's firmware if any were to be found.  Performance
advantages are a bonus of course.
