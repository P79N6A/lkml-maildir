Discussion is here:

In short, we're changing the behavior so that when no policy is loaded, 
SELinux does not label files at all.  Currently it does add an 'unlabeled' 
label in this case, which we've found causes problems later.
SELinux always maintains a safe internal label if there is none, so with 
this patch, we just stick with that and wait until a policy is loaded 
before adding a persistent label on disk.
