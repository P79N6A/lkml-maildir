Below is from ACPI spec 3.0 (p405). From my understanding, OS should
save/restore NVS memory ?
ACPI Non-Volatile-Sleeping Memory (NVS). Memory identified by the BIOS
as being reserved by the BIOS for its use. OSPM is required to tag this
memory as cacheable, and to save and restore its image before entering
an S4 state. Except as directed by control methods, OSPM is not allowed
to use this physical memory. OSPM will call the _PTS control method some
time before entering a sleeping state, to allow the platforms AML code
to update this memory image before entering the sleeping state. After
the system awakes from an S4 state, OSPM will restore this memory area
and call the _WAK control method to enable the BIOS to reclaim its
memory image.
