Sure you can shoot yourself in the foot.
   "msync  flushes  changes  made  to  the  in-core copy of a file that
    was mapped into memory using mmap(2) back to disk. "
We usually don't cater to foot shooters at the expense of valid users.
AFAIKS, basically the only valid use for MS_ASYNC is for the app to tell
the kernel that it isn't going to write here for a long time, so writeback
may as well be scheduled; or to pipeline other work with an upcoming data
integrity point which will need to be guaranteed by a second call to MS_SYNC.

Well it remains the same conceptual operation (asynchronously "schedule"
dirty pages for writeout). However it simply becomes more useful to start
the writeout immediately, given that's the (pretty explicit) hint that is
given to us.
