If I took that approach then you could never
use the synclink drivers without generic HDLC.
The synclink drivers can be used independent of
the generic HDLC or with generic HDLC depending
on space requirements and application.
If you can provide a patch that continues allowing
that level of flexibility in a way more to
your liking, then please post it and I'll have a look.
