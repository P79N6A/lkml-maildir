Yes, __group_complete_signal() is called after the signal has been added to
the ->shared_pending. But it does not signal_wake_up()s process, because of
this check in wants_signal():
	if (p->flags & PF_EXITING)
		return 0;
The intent was to find another thread in the thread group which can accept
this signal. May be we need special check in __group_complete_signal() under
"else if (thread_group_empty(p))".
You still can kill this process via tkill, though.
Oleg.
