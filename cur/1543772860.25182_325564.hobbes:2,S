Subject: [PATCH 2.6][PPC32] RESEND: don't recursively crash in die() on CHRP/PReP machines
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/6/14/163

This patch avoids recursive crash (leading to kernel stack overflow) in
die() on CHRP/PReP machines when CONFIG_PMAC_BACKLIGHT=y.
set_backlight_* functions are placed in pmac section, which is discarded
when _machine != _MACH_Pmac.
I already posted this patch to LKML few months ago:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0412.0/0300.html
and it has been applied to linux-2.4 tree, but still not 2.6.
(patch was made against 2.4.27, but still applies cleanly against
kernels up to 2.6.11.12)
