I can't tell if this is in the ide-scsi driver or the scsi cdrom driver.  I
still personally wish that the ide drivers were modules of scsi instead of
being a seperate block device.  USB storage creates scsi adapters, ide-scsi
allows ATAPI access via scsi.  Why not do this for ide in general (if that
starts a flame war, please don't contribute =)
