yes, thanx,
I am very interested in those details.
For the tests i made on sparc64 gcc 3.0.1 is really faster than previous
versions (2.95.3 and egcs 1.1.2), but on AMD Athlon is a different story.
I think I can infer that gcc speed depends a lot from CPUs, but
usually and storically gcc was heavilly x86 optimized...
