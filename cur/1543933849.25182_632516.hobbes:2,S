The problem isn't specific to USB.  And you will not be able to fix it 
unless you make drastic changes to the lockdep checker.
lockdep warns whenever a task acquires a mutex while holding another
mutex of the same kind (that is, the same member in another structure
of the same type).  But there are lots of places where the kernel needs
to acquire dev->sem for one device while already holding
dev->parent->sem.  There's no way to remove these, which means there's
no way to prevent lockdep from issuing a warning.
Around a month ago I had a discussion with Peter Zijlstra about the
problems in converting the device semaphores to mutexes; you may be
able to find it in the LKML archives.  Doing the conversion while
keeping lockdep happy is a very hard problem and we were not able to
solve it.
It's possible that you may be able to convert the semaphores in struct
class or other structures.  But you won't succeed with struct device.
