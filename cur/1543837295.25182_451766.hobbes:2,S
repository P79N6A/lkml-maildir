Hi!
Okay, I'm little out of time now, and I do not understand 2 and 3 in
the series.
> Make swsusp use memory bitmaps to store its internal information during the
> resume phase of the suspend-resume cycle.
> 
> If the pfns of saveable pages are saved during the suspend phase instead of
> the kernel virtual addresses of these pages, we can use them during the resume
> phase directly to set the corresponding bits in a memory bitmap.  Then, this

So... if page in highmem is allocated during resume, you'll still need
to copy it during assembly "atomic copy", right? Unfortunately, our
assembler parts can't do it just now...?
