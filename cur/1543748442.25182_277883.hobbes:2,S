    Well, I happen to had such Plextor drive under a VIA 686B and it
worked good with DMA. At least, DMA was enabled and the drive never
issued a 'DMA disabled' error. This was under 2.4.10. I no longer
have that drive so I cannot make tests under a newer test. The drive
was used with success using both SCSI hostadapter emulation and IDE
driver. I think I have the logs of that time if you are interested.
