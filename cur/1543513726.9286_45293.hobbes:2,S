Hello,
The following feature appeared in the new version of ppp driver.
diald uses ioctl PPPIOCGUNIT on terminal device to get the ppp unit
number attached to the terminal.  In the new ppp driver there is no
such ioctl in ppp_async.c.  I solved the problem so far by simply
adding this ioctl to ppp_async, but I am not quite sure it is a good
solution.  Is there any another method to deal with this problem, or
this ioctl was simply forgotten?
