One of the things we are working on is to provide exactly something
like this. Not just that, within the isolated partitions, we want
to be able to provide completely different environment. For example,
we need to be able to run or more realtime processes of an application
in one partition while the other partition runs the database portion
of the application. For this to succeed, they need to be completely
isolated.
It would be nice if someone explains a potential CKRM implementation for 
this kind of complete isolation.
Thanks
