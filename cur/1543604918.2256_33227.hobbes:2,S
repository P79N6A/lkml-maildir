At point 2 you are _already_ screwed.  Depending on who hits (hell,
what's the equivalent of :x in Emacsese?) first, one of you is
going to lose results of editing.  Doctor, it hurts when I do it...
If you want versioning - use source control system.  Or go play
with DEC cra^WOSes.  In RSX that "feature" sucked (and so did
editor semantics, but that's a separate story).
Without versioning - see above.
