I highlighted a few cases where AS went really wrong during the 
presentation, like on really large RAID 0 arrays, but in general 
(referring back to slides) AS trailed other schedulers by 5-10% on ext3, 
but had real trouble with XFS, losing by as much as %145 on 5disk raid5 
system for a mix of workloads.  Perhaps this is the piece you remember.
