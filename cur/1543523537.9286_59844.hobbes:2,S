Yeah, 10ms isn't very good (though isn't it 1ms on Alphas?). But
add_timer_randomness() doesn't always use jiffies. I quote from the
source:
#if defined (__i386__)
        if (boot_cpu_data.x86_capability & X86_FEATURE_TSC) {
                __u32 high;
                __asm__(".byte 0x0f,0x31"
                        :"=a" (time), "=d" (high));
                num ^= high;
        } else {
                time = jiffies;
        }
#else
        time = jiffies;
#endif
