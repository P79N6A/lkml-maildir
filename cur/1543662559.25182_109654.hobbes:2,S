With Interrupts disabled.
machine_kexec switch the cpu to physical address mode (it turns the mmu off).
Copies the kernel to where it needs to run.
Then it jumps to an entry point.
kexec has put in a stub piece of code, and pointed the entry point at that location.
The stub code setups of a gdt, the kernel can cope with.
The stub code setups a parameter table just like the real mode code generates.
The stub code jumps in at the 32bit entry point.
[There is another stub that will attempt to start the kernel at the 16bit entry
 point but it is not used by default].
Interrupts are off the entire time.

Yes.

It is not hard to patch the decompression code to display a message, but
by default it does not output to serial...
You might want to run mkelfImage on a vmlinux so you can skip the decompression
step.  It adds a stub to the elf file that gets passed to kexec so that
you can skip the decompression.

Also I have some assembly language macros that display text out the serial port, if you want
to instrument up the kernel you are booting.
