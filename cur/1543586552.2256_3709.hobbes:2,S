eg. to create a new "foo" directory in /proc/net:
        new_dir = proc_mkdir("foo", proc_net);
then use the resulting dir entry to create files in this new directory:
        entry = create_proc_entry("bar", 0700, new_dir);
and use remove_proc_entry() on the file entry and on the directory entry
to clean things up.
