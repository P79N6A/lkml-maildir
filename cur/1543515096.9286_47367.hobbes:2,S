I don't think it's right either, but ... where would *you* suggest
finding a __divdi3 function?  In a sense libgcc is not really an
external library, since it is part of gcc itself.  I guess the
alternative for the kernel is just not to use any functionality that
gcc needs libgcc math functions for.
