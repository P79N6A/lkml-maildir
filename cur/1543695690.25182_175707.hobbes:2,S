I realized that when I disable the hotplug script the camera is detected
only once (as it should).
The script fetches the directory listing off the camera... thus is
probably opening+closing the device once. So I wonder whether this could
somehow trigger an usb disconnect on close() making the usb driver to
redetect the device ?!

If still needed I will do.
