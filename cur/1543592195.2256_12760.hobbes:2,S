I'm not sure about this as I have never had to deal with something like that 
myself. However, I think that when adding more RAM, you should also add more 
Cache to your system - otherwise performance may drop as described by you. 
Don't ask me, though, how one is supposed to add more cache to a mainboard...
If my above assumption is not right, I hope that someone will share the 
actual facts with you and me ;-)
