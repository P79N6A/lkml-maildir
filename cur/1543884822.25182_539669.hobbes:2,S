Subject: kernel/relay.c: a strange usage of delayed_work

relay_switch_subbuf() does schedule_delayed_work(&buf->wake_readers, 1),
wakeup_readers() only does wake_up_interruptible() and nothing more.
Why can't we use a plain timer for this?
In any case, this "wake_up ->read_wait after a minimal possible delay"
looks somewhat strange to me, could you explain? just curious.
Oleg.
