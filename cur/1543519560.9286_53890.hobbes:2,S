fwiw, Red Hat 6.0 glibc-devel depends on kernel-headers.  That means to
compile things with Glibc you have to have a set of kernel headers
installed.
Which is always annoying because I /never/ want the same kernel headers
as the package manager would like there.
Because I develop programs (not modules) that use kernel headers (mainly
ioctls), that are not present in older kernels or in Glibc itself.

Things would indeed be a lot simpler without __KERNEL__ at all.
