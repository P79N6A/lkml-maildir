Yes.  Well the build system (kernel configuration) would be modified
to instead of having a list of Kconfigs and dir's and Makefile.libs and
such, be able to scan a directory of files which tell it about those
things.  At least, in my design it would.

Well that's good.

...............   You know.  Maybe it's not enough to split into categories.
Maybe it should be categories and categorical breakdowns.  I can see
3.0 or something (maybe even 2.8) reaching 1 gig.
