Can you provide any information about the kernel panic?  6.1.13 is still
quite old.  You may have better luck using version 6.2.4, but I can't
really say without knowing more about your system, the devices on the
bus, and the nature of the crash.  The 2930CU seems to work okay here.
Latest aic7xxx drivers can be found here:
