I like it. I wonder if we should get kswapd to stick its priority
into the zone at the point where zone_watermark_ok becomes true,
rather than setting all zones to the lowest priority? That would
require a bit more logic though I guess.
For that matter (going off the topic a bit), I wonder if
try_to_free_pages should have a watermark check there too? This
might help reduce the latency issue you brought up where one process
has reclaimed a lot of pages, but another isn't making any progress
and has to go through the full priority range? Maybe that's
statistically pretty unlikely?
