Hi David,
I appreciate your work on unifying common code, but have some comments.

In short: please remove all "const" markers from the function, 
	try to uninline it somewhere and resend.
Explanation:
If this compiles without any warning, then your compiler is clearly broken.
You promise to not modify the memory pointed to by "sg" and set it
to zero then?
You also assign buflen to a variable, which voids the "const" attribute
anyway. For "buf" this is also wrong. The memory pointed to it
will be assigned to a variable whose modification you cannot control.
And while you are at it, please check, wether this can be uninlined,
since it does a lot of things and is called from quite some sites
then.
