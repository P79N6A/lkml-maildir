We introduced split drivers for 2.6.13.  There are new layer drivers
that sit ontop of mptscsih.ko.  These drivers are split along bus
protocal, so there is mptspi.ko, mptfc.ko, and mptsas.ko.  This is
to tie into the scsi transport layers that are split the same.
For 1030(a SPI controller)
If your using RedHat, you need to change mptscish to mptspi in
/etc/modprobe.conf.
If your using SuSE, you need to change mptscish to mptspi in
/etc/sysconfig/kernel
