	Oh, okay. Should that memory offset be a source of processor time
waste for allocating memory when switching through FB and X, for an
example? If so, sharing the code (instead of duplicating it) is the ideal
approach.

	Hmm, but as you stated, I do not think code duplication should be
the best approach.

	If I have such time, I'll contact him. But for the moment, if the
code does not compile (still with 2.4.18-rc2-ac1) I'll duplicate the code
to get it working until a better solution raises.
