There are different levels of journaling.  Most FS journaling only journals the metadata.
Both ext3 (in current versions) and reiserfs do this.  At some point the reiserfs team may
add options to mkfs to allow full journaling.  This would hurt perf but may be necessary
if you are using the FS as a DB.
