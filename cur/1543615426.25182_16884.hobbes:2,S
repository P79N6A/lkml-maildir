The behaviour is undefined by the C standard.  But the mentioned
pointer arithmetic is defined in the environment where it has been
used.  GCC tries to optimize undefined C-standard behaviour.  And
IMHO that's the point.  It may optimize defined behaviour and should
not touch things undefined by the standard.
