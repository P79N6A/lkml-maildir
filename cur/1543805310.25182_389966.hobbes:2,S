Incorrect, sorry. Do you really make Linux incompatible to the rest of the

Your last line is wrong

The Linux Kernel fols unfortunately artificially hides information for the 
/dev/hd* interface making exactly this compatibility impossible.

If you are against personal attacks, why didn't you intercede for the
postings from Jens Axboe and Albert Cahalan?
I am against personal attacks and this is the first time where it tooks
more than a day before LKML people started with personal attacks against me.
So in principle this is some sort of progress compared to former times.
If you like to continue this discussion, I would like you to stay reasonable 
and help to keep the discussion stay based on technical based arguments.
