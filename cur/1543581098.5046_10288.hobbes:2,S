struct 
{
	u32 flags;	/* because everything needs flags */
	struct io_completion *completions;
	kiovec_t sglist[0];
} thingy;
now kmalloc one object of the header the sglist of the right size and the
completion list. Shove the completion list on the end of it as another
array of objects and what is the problem.

But that can be two arrays
