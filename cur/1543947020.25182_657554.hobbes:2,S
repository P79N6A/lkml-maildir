So it returns the right value.
Jeff, Jesse, please check one thing for me.
Please boot 2.6.25-rc2 (or better, the current head of the Linus' tree) with
no_console_suspend and try to do the following:
# echo 8 > /proc/sys/kernel/printk
# echo core > /sys/power/pm_test
# echo disk > /sys/power/state
(that will run a test of the freeze/unfreeze code without creating the image)
and then
# echo mem > /sys/power/state
(that will run a test of the suspend/resume code without actually suspending).
I'd like to know if that works.
Thanks,
Rafael
