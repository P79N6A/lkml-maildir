	I want Tridge (Andrew Tridgell <tridge@samba.org>) or Jeremey
(Jeremy Allison <jallison@cthulhu.engr.sgi.com>) of the Samba team in
the loop on this.  Jeremey, in particular, has been involved in benchmarks
that have wiped the floor with NT.
> To refuse is to admit failure, not even giving Linux a chance.
