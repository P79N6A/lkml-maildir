   It's improbable you'll need any -- the rest of the driver should not
use any chipset specific information since it's driven purely by the
ACPI table and the whole purpose of the init function is to initialize
the chip and generate its ACPI table in case the BIOS doesn't provide
one.

   So let's at least remove the first column of the table which is
completely useless as it's equal to the row index.
				Have a nice fortnight
