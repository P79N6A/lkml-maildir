This is a C macro. Apparently in your arch it isn't used in any 
assembler code. The reason that i386 doesn't cast to unsigned long is 
that casts aren't an assembler construct, and this macro is used in 
arch/i386/boot/setup.S. Also, PAGE_OFFSET includes an (unsigned long) 
cast as well, __PAGE_OFFSET doesn't, and that explains why i386 uses 
__PAGE_OFFSET.
