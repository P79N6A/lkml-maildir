Stephen:
A number of patches to the APM driver have been submitted to
lkml recently.  To summarize, these are (Did I miss any?):
Notify listener of suspend before notifying driver  (Russell King)
    http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=100819765228734&w=2
Fix idle handling                                   (Andreas Steinmetz)
    http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=100754277600661&w=2
Control apm idle calling by runtime parameter       (Andrej Borsenkow)
    http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=100852862320955&w=2
Each of these changes is required, IMHO.  However, the Russell King
patch probably won't apply without modifications.  Also, it needs to
be modified so that it will send a resume event to listeners in case
a driver rejects a suspend event that listeners have already
processed.  I think that this change should wait for 2.5, improvement
though it be, because it changes the behavior of the apm driver in
a significant way.
The other patches ought to apply cleanly to 2.4.17 and are independent
of Russell's changes, so ought to go into 2.4.18-pre, I think.  Can
you get them ready for Marcelo?
Cheers
Thomas Hood
