aaarrrggh!!!

We can't even fix this with a lock_kernel wrapped around
the dev->owner stuff in dev_open(), because the netdevice's
open() can sleep.
<subliminalmessage>prumpf's patch</sumliminalmessage>
Perhaps the best thing to do here is to create a system-wide
semaphore for module unloading. So we do a down()/up()
in sys_delete_module() and do this in dev_open:
        /*
         *      Call device private open method
         */
        down(&mod_unload_sem);                  /* sync with sys_delete_module() */
        if (dev->owner == 0) {
                if (dev->open)
                        ret = dev->open(dev);
        } else {
                if (try_inc_mod_count(dev->owner)) {
                        if (dev->open) {
                                if ((ret = dev->open(dev)) != 0)
                                        __MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT(dev->owner);
                        }
                } else
                        ret = -ENODEV;
        }
        up(&mod_unload_sem);
