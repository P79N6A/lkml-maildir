Hey! Hmm. Odd, this email never got to me directly, instead I found it

You're right, basically I took the previous __loop_delay() and
__rtsc_delay() and moved them to delay_pit() and delay_tsc(),
respectively. I guess the naming is somewhat confusing, but since this
was meant as just a cleanup, I'm trying to use the same code in the same
conditions.(ie: when using the PIT time-source, use the loop delay. when
using the TSC time-source, use the TSC delay). A changing the name or a
comment explaining it would def clear that up. 
You do bring up an interesting idea: actually using the PIT to do
__delay. I think its possible, but not really worth it, as the PIT is
such a nasty bit of hardware to deal with. I'd guess that just reading
the PIT would likely delay for more time then what was actually
requested.
Thanks for the feedback!
