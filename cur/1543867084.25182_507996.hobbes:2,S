Correct - asm-offsets is used to transfer constants for .c to assembler,
which us especially convinient for constant that differ when a stuct
is changed.

Basically what is requested is to move the generic parts of asm-offsets
generation from top-level Kbuild file to a generic file somewhere.
Since this is not generic Kbuild functionality but more specific to the
kernel it should not be part of Kbuild generic files.
include/asm-generic/asm-offsets seems to be a fair place for it.
It would contain the sed-y parts as well as cmd_offsets definition.
I would be glad if you could give that a spin.
