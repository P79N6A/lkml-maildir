I'm not sure what you mean by the distinction between a "somewhat"
hierarchy and a "simply flat" hierarchy ... I'll guess you're asking how
deep we envision these sets being.
I'd envision they start out just one or two deep, then over time they
tend to reflect the several layer deep organizational structure of the
institution paying for the big iron, _plus_ another layer or two to
handle the cpu/memory placement needs of more complex applications.
With occassional examples a few times that.
