It gets _allocated_ in a moment, but things don't actually get
swapped out. This isn't a problem.
The real problem is that we don't actively reclaim swap space
when it gets full. We just assign swap to parts of processes,
but we never reclaim it when we need swap space for something
else; at least, not until the process exit()s or exec()s.

Linux reclaims swap cache (and swap space) when it encounters
them in its scan of memory. It doesn't take the trouble of
freeing the swap on exit() but the swap space will be freed
later.
