For the fm801 gameport case it is fine - it's just one more check in the 
_probe() function, performing the same error path as other cases do.
ALSA case has already been solved by calling snd_card_disconnect() on 
error path.
But I agree that sk98lin and parport_serial_pci patches are likely broken.
Thanks,
