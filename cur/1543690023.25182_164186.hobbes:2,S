Are the kksymoops reports parsable by the userspace ksymoops?  Whenever I
run the 2.6 kernel resolved oops through the user space ksymoops, it points
to a different part of the kernel, leading me to suspect that i shouldn't be
doing that.
Is that right?  Also I use modules a lot, will that affect this?
I'd like to get this fixed.  Any instructions / patches would be helpful.
