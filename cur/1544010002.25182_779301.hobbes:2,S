yes, that would suck.  otoh, our current warning spew actually causes bugs.
I wonder if we could add a printk_stfu() which isn't declared
attribute(printf) and which simply calls printk.  We might still get a
single warning at the interface point.

Yes, we've had actual bugs in the kernel from this, where the control
string was user-provided.  root-only user, fortunately.
