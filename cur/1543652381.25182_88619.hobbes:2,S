Subject: [PATCH] Fixup pci_alloc_consistent with 64bit DMA masks on i386
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi Marcello,
I posted this small one-liner to Alan Cox (and to the lkml) in August but 
it doesn't seem to have gotten into the mainline yet (I think it is in -ac).
The issue is that PCI drivers which uses 64bit DMA masks (in order to do 
DAC) is making unnecessary use of the DMA zone memory (the <16Meg region 
on i386) when doing pci_alloc_consitent().
Hope this gets into the next -rc or .21-pre
Regards,
