Done.
(Well, it's going to take a while to mirror out).
That's 2.3MB of logs (even the shortlog weighs in at 5000+ lines and
201kB, if anybody cares. I didn't upload that, and the kernel mailing list
limits don't allow me to put it here, but git users can do
	git-rev-list --pretty=short v2.6.12..v2.6.13 | git-shortlog
to generate it. You might additionally want to add a "--no-merges" if you
don't want to see people doing non-linear merges).
