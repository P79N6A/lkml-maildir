The problem here is that it's not ext3 bh's only. They're still the normal
buffer head.  The problem arrises because the ext3 "journal head" is
allocated within these bit spin locks. I tried to monkey with putting the
locks in the journal heads and have checks to see when to free them, but
it wasn't that simple. I started having problems with some of the freeing
transactions, I might have assumed too much.
I'll give it one more try to get it into the journal heads, but after
that, (if I fail) I'll let someone who understands the ext3 system better
handle this.
