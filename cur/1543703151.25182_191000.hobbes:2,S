showkey _will_ still show 84, because the keycode still is 84. Only the
rawmode emulation was fixed. I really don't want to make the keycode 43
because the 103rd key it is a different key than backslash. 
So on console you still need to change your keymap. I could change the
keycode to be something else than 84, but that'd not help much. I'm
currently toying with the idea of detecting a keymap that expects the
key to generate code 43 and do a workaround for it ...
