Which program responsible for permission change or display uses decimal
or hex number format ?
Well, according to the mount documentation you are right:
       mode=value
              For non-Rock Ridge  volumes,  give  all  files  the
              indicated  mode.   (Default:  read  permission  for
              everybody.)  Since Linux 2.1.37 one no longer needs
              to specify the mode in decimal. (Octal is indicated
              by a leading 0.)
OK, I must admit that this patch is coming from Kernel 2.0.
But I don't think that decimal/hex numbers make any sense for permission
mode....
Anyway, I'll wait a week to look if there are any other complains with this
patch and post the "corrected" patch then. OK ?
