One key difference between SELinux and AppArmor is that AA is _not_ 
designed to protect against the actions of root, it's designed to block 
attacks that would let someone become root.
becouse of this strategy it's far simpler to configure becouse you do not 
have to do all the work to control root. This also limits what it can 
defend against, and so it's not 'perfect security' (and after all there is 
only one way to get 'perfect security' 
http://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/papers/a1-firewall/
 ), but 
AA is still a useful tool.
the 'hard shell, soft center' approach isn't as secure as 'full 
hardening' (assuming that both are properly implemented), but the fact 
that it's far easier to understand and configure the hard shell means that 
it's also far more likly to be implemented properly.
remember that it's not really a matter of people deciding not to write 
SELinux policies and instead do AA, it's a matter of people deciding to 
use AA instead of doing nothing.
