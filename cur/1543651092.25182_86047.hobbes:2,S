I am experiencing dropped packets as sundance RX side when simple nfs copying
takes places. These are at a rate of about 1-2% of RX packets. I call it
"weird" because I cannot see a definitive problem location in the driver
source. fact stays one simple copy drops packets, something I never saw in the
same setup (same cabling, same mainboard) with tulip cards.
I know that this is a hell of a "bug-report", but I really want to point out
only a strange difference between tulip-setup and sundance-setup.
