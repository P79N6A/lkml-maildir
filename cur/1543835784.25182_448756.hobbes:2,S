I have taken a look at suspend2 and decided I did not like it. (see
archives). If you think parts of suspend2 are useful (== fix problem
on hardware you have), separate them and submit them.
If you want to claim that swsusp is broken, you should attach bugzilla
ids. Anything else is unhelpful.
I'm maintainer, but that does not mean that I have every possible
notebook on earth.
