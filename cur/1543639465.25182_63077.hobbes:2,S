fsx.c came up a while ago on l-k. it's an old (but still very useful) fs
stressor(sp) from neXT. i have a copy davej modded for linux. if you can't
find it, i can send it to you. i haven't been brave enough to run it myself,
on my alpha's reiserfs. 8) it found some hard to find bugs in ext2 that were
lurking for years (iirc).
