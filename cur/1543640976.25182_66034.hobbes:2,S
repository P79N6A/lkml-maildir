I have an el-cheapo sound card in my desktop machine, which works fine
for the odd mail notification sound. However, it tends to produce
quite some white noise and a highpitched tone when not in use. I
vaguely remember some buzz (well, at least a light hum) a while back
about automatically setting the mixer to zero for synth/pcm when not
in use.. Was there ever a patch created for this, and if not, would
anyone be interested in one?
