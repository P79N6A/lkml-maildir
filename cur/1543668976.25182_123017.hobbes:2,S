I may have missed some emails on this topic, so I apologize if this
objection was already answered.  In any case, if you're running with
Andrew's patch that added a del_timer_sync to release_dev(), I think I
see how that could cause problems.  Here's what I said in my previous
email:
  From looking at workqueue.c (especially the comment in
  queue_delayed_work() that says "Increase nr_queued so that the flush
  function knows that there's something pending."), it seems like
  flush_scheduled_work() should wait until even delayed work is done.
  Given that, I don't think the del_timer_sync() should be there --
  wouldn't flush_scheduled_work() block forever, since nr_queued can
  never reach 0 now?
Also, I didn't see an answer to the worry I expressed below:
  I don't see how it's _ever_ safe to call flush_scheduled_work().
  The comment in workqueue.c before flush_workqueue() says "NOTE: if
  work is being added to the queue constantly by some other context
  then this function might block indefinitely."  But
  flush_scheduled_work() is flushing the keventd_wq, which other code
  will definitely add work to.  If we're unlucky,
  flush_scheduled_work() could block forever.  Am I just being
  paranoid?
I admit that flush_scheduled_work() is unlikely to cause problems in
most real world situations, but I'd be curious to know if anyone
thinks this could ever lead to a livelock under some strange condition.
