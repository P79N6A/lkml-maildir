Good. :-)

Either you rely on routing tables, or you do not, which is used
when routing tables are still not set up, or setup ambiguously,
or use of them just do not make sense which happens for multicasts/
limited/broadcasts/link local addresses. It is the thing which ifi_ifindex
does.
I do no see how it is possible to classify a middle way as "rational".
Well, and frankly speaking I do not see how it could be useful.
