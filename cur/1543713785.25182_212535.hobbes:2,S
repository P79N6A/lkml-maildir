hmm, well breaking ABI here should not hurt anywhere, as 
they are 'just' defined flags, and no code should rely on the
actual values (or if it does, it is broken anyway, right?)
but if you 'think' that it will break something, it's okay
for me to keep the 'old' values ... and 'just' add new ones
for RDONLY, NOATIME, and NODIRATIME ...
best,
Herbert
