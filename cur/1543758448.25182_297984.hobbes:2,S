I have a question about the implementation in __wake_up_common() that I'm
hoping someone might know the background on.  This function wakes up
a specified number of tasks for a wait_queue.  I'm wondering why it doesn't
wake up the tasks in priority order, so that for things following wake-one 
semantics high priority tasks get woken up before lower priority tasks.
The only thing I can think of off the top of my head is that it simplifies the 
O(1) implementation, but I'm wondering if maybe there is something else.
Thanks,
Chad
