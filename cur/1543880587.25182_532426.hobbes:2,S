Hello Everyone, 
Oleg had pointed out some subtle races which could lead to the failure
of the process freezer in the patchset which I had posted earlier.
A couple of these problems seem to be present in the latest -mm(2.6.21-rc6-mm1).
This is an attempt to fix them.
Awaiting you feedback, 
Regards
gautham.
