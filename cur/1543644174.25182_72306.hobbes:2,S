Subject: [PATCH] schedule() in_atomic() check

Linus,
Resend of patch to make the in_atomic() check in schedule() actually
work.  You merged the PREEMPT_ACTIVE bits, we just need to handle the
exit() case correctly.
Tested with and without CONFIG_PREEMPT -- works like a charm.
Patch is against current BK.
