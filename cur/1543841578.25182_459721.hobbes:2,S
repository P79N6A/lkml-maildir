We're already desperately short on page flags on 32-bit architectures.
It seems a wee bit silly to add two arch-generic flags for what is a
very specialized arch-specific feature at this point.
I know that there are 32-bit s390 kernels, but would this be a
reasonable feature to restrict to only 64-bit kernels?  That might be a
decent compromise.
