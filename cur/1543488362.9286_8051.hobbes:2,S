Dear Kernel Gurus,
I recently upgraded my linux kernel to 2.2.x and encountered some serious
problems with my HP SureStore 7200i CD-RW. Apparently, the kernel does
not even recognize my HP :-(
Therefore, does anyone know if there are any known problems with this
CDR and kernel 2.2.1 or 2.2.2, perhaps related to a situation where
two CD-ROMs are connected to secondary IDE interface (IRQ 15)?
Here's the full story:
I've got redhat 5.2, patched to support kernel 2.2
kernel 2.2.2
two IBM 6.4 GB hard disks connected to primary IDE (IRQ14)
Toshiba 6202B 32x CD-ROM connected to secondary IDE (IRQ 15) as master
HP SureStore 7200i CD-RW connected to secondary IDE (IRQ 15) as slave
Loadlin 1.6a as the linux boot method
With the kernel compiled according to the instructions on CD-writing howto
(IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM disabled, SCSI hostadapter emulation and generic SCSI
CD-ROM support compiled into the kernel), the kernel boots, after
displaying a few screens of various SCSI errors & warnings, finally
recognizing only the Toshiba CD-ROM. (see dmesg output at the end)
With the kernel compiled without SCSI-support (using HP only for reading),
I can't get the kernel to boot at all. Instead, it hangs up with several
"Interrupt lost" or similar errors. With special boot parameters
hdd=cdrom hdd=noprobe I can get the kernel to boot and even mount
both CD-ROMs nicely.
From cdrecord's readme.atapi I found a notice:
If you have problems to talk to the device when it is jumpered as "slave"
try to use it as "master". Similar type of notices can be found in the 
Documentation/ide.txt or Documentation/cdrom/ide-cd
Unfortunately, I have not been able to test different combinations of
the HD and CD hardware, but do you think such a hardware setup would be
the reason to my problems or perhaps only some unfortunate guesses with
configuration before compiling the new kernel?
Sorry if I have sent this to the wrong place, but I wasn't sure who would
be the right person in MAINTAINERS list.
Thank you!
Regards,
/Mara
