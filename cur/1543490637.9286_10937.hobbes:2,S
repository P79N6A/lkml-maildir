There is a small problem with passing everything through Alan: as
you know Linus' and Alan's trees are very different with respect to
the NFS code because Alan accepted to test out the 8k patches. This
means that
 a) Not all patches to Linus' tree are applicable to Alan's tree
 b) Patches that need to be applied to both trees usually need some
    massaging when moving from one to the other.
This is why I generally try to pass patches that for Alan directly to
him, and only put out fixes against Linus' tree on linux-kernel. Since
Alan has been very quick to put out new releases, I think that has
been an acceptable practice.
Note: b) is in part due to the extensive NFS client structure changes,
and in part due to a few trivial fixes to the sunrpc client. The
latter are what affect fs/lockd and fs/nfsd, and are probably the main
cause of problems with the knfsd patches (apart from HJ's fix to
fs/nfs/dir.c:nfs_rename which is unnecessary on Alan's tree). Most
trouble could therefore perhaps be avoided if we start the merge of
the sunrpc fixes in question to Linus' tree.
Cheers,
  Trond
