Because the compiler might optimize it away.

I'm afraid they don't (at least with kernel 2.0, I didn't try this with
2.4). They have microsecond resolution, but increment only every 1/HZ.
Someone gave me a hint to loop on rdtsc. I will look into this.

Good point!

Yes, it can. My delays are 'minimal' values, if it takes longer, there's
no problem apart from the speed of the display update. I have to wait 40
microsecs after every character I send to the display, which makes 3.2
milliseconds for a complete update of a 20x4 display. If every delay
would be 10 msec, the whole update would last 0.8 seconds (which is
unusable).
