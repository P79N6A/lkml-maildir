Jesse,
Do note that I did not oppose the cpuset inclusion(by saying that, "I am not
pitching for a marriage"), and here are the reasons:
1.Eventhough cpuset can be implemented under ckrm, currently the cpu controller
  and mem controller(in ckrm) cannot handle the isolating part of the cpuset stuff
  cleanly and provide the resource management capabilities ckrm is supposed to 
  provide. For that reason, one cannot expect both the cpuset and ckrm functionality
  in a same kernel.
2.I doubt that users that need cpuset will need the resource management capabilities
  ckrm provides.
My email was intented mainly to erase the notion that ckrm cannot handle cpuset.
Also, I wanted to understand if there is any real issues and that is why I talked
with Matt about why he thought ckrm cannot accomodate memset before sending the
second piece of mail.

We did post to lkml a while back and got comments on it. We are working on it and
will post the fixed code again in few weeks with couple of controllers.
