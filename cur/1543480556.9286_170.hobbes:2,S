Hello Friends,
I'm puzzled by the returned data of the 'readdir' call. The dirent
structure has a d_reclen entry. If I run a small C program under 2.0.36
which returns the d_reclen of the root directory entries I get:
d_name '.' 
d_reclen:12  strlen(d_name):1
d_name '..' 
d_reclen:16  strlen(d_name):2
d_name 'lost+found' 
d_reclen:24  strlen(d_name):10
d_name 'tmp' 
d_reclen:16  strlen(d_name):3
d_name 'var' 
d_reclen:16  strlen(d_name):3
d_name 'etc' 
d_reclen:16  strlen(d_name):3
[snipped]
d_reclen is *very* different from the strlen of the entry. I would expect
d_reclen to be equal to the strlen result. d_recelen seems to return the 
number of bytes of allocation in the directory file, these are multiple
of 4 . 32 bits INTS.
In the GNU C_library in the function getcwd d_reclen (d_namelen) is used
to build the pathname which sometimes give odd results i.e. somewhere in a
mounted NCP or Samba tree.
If one uses 'less' or 'vi' or '/bin/pwd' these programs complain that they
are unable to find the current working directory.
Regards
Kees
PS: I tried Alan Cox before but "It's on his queue" so may take a while
before he is able to look at it. :-)
