Since you have to set the command line anyway ip=dhcp is no extra
burden and it lets you use the same kernel to boot of the harddrive etc.

I don't believe that is a real world situation.
I boot diskless all of time and supporting a ramdisk is trivial.  You
just a have a program that slaps a kernel a ramdisk, and some command
line arguments into a single image, along with a touch of adapter code
to set the kernel parameters correctly and then boot that.
