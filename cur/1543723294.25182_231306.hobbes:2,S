There's always a group of people who have shitlisted brand X due to
the way something failed, this is especially common in disk drives.
I'm sorry you had the problems, but they're not indicitive of Maxtor
as a whole, or we wouldn't be in business at all.  I'm not sure how
our account with Tivo looks, but last I heard we were still the #1
supplier of drives into settop boxes.
I do think our new MaxLine III is a pretty hot drive, and it supports
NCQ, (with big performance gains in server-type applications) so as
soon as Jeff can get the ahci driver into the kernel...
