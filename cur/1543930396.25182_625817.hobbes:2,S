Besides, in order for scsi_wait_scan to work, drivers need to support it
explicitly, don't they?  If so, simply kill the "default m" from config
SCSI_WAIT_SCAN and let any driver which is integrated with it select it.
(Not that I'm a friend of select, but here is a case where it won't hurt
too much.)
