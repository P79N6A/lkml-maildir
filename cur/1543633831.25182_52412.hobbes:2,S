Ditto. As we rapidly approach the 100th incarnation of Martin's IDE
patches, there are still cases where we die within seconds of booting
on some old PIO-only boxes for eg.  There seems to be far too much
"lets rip this out as it doesn't do much anyway" rather than fixing
known problems.
When the IDE carnage first started back circa 2.5.3, I had contemplated
not merging *any* of the IDE patches, just so that people who want to
work on other areas could have something solid to build upon.
I regret not following through on that instinct.
        Dave.
