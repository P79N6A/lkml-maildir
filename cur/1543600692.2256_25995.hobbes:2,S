I was able to boot a recent 2.4.x kernel that was less than the floppy 
size requirement. Kernels greater than that size will automatically 
reboot my machine (using the Win95 Command Prompt Only option + LOADLIN 
1.6a). My last recorded 2.4.x kernel to boot with a size greater than a 
floppy is 2.4.5-ac17, which is very close the size of the recent kernels 
). The same .config has been used with the recent 2.4.x kernels as 
2.4.5-ac17 (minor additions for new fs supports). The power management 
option is not enabled.
Regards,
Frank
