Any decent mail client will give you quality threads, much better than
any current web forum software (because you get a tree instead of the
flat crap they give you).  And separate topic areas already exist,
they're called multiple mailing-lists.

Post-moderation sucks, and opens some interesting legal issues.
Pre-moderation is way too slow and labor intensive.

You can have that with mailing-lists.  Cf linux-announce.  Not very
useful in practice.

Much slower than a local mailbox.
No filtering.
No choice of presentation (or not enough).
No scoring.
Much higher bandwidth needs.
Hard to archive.
Can't forward posts.
Can't grep posts.
Can't save some posts in a contiguous mailbox and patch -p1 them.
And the most annoying part, people feel anonymous on web forums and as
a result post any crap just because they can, while most of tend to
take having to put their email address with usually they real name in
it more seriously.
  OG.
