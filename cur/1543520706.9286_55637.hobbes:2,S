     In the event when the attacker is stupid enough to launch from a dial-up
of an ISP, and I do see this frequently, it gives you a chance to kill the
offending account. 
     When they use a previously compromised host as a platform to launch their
attack from, it gives you the chance to notify the admin of that host so they
can secure it.
