We've talked in the past about throwing out the buddy allocator and adopting 
something more modern and efficient and I hope somebody will actually get 
around to doing that.  In any event, defragging is an orthogonal issue.  Some 
allocation strategies may be statistically more resistiant to fragmentation 
than others, but no allocator has been invented, or ever will be, that can 
guarantee that terminal fragmentation will never occur - only active 
defragmentation can provide such a guarantee.
