A struct timeval - indeed, any non-arithmetic type - depends on changing  
the definition of the C language, and of course of POSIX too. I might add  
it depends on a change that is quite unlikely to be approved, either.
There's only one large-capacity time_t allowed by the C standard (or  
POSIX) that can hold more than the largest integer type - double. (Well,  
or float if it's indeed larger.) Do you really want to use floating-point  
here?

Obviously, I agree differently than you do.
