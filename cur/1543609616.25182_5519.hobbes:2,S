Hello all,
One program that creates a pipe between two processes and measures
the ping/pong latency of messages between the two processes gives
me something like;
1000 iterations - ping/pong time
max =   3495 us
min =      6 us
avg = 47.212 us
In another application where I use a UNIX STREAM socket, I get
a typical latency of one send() of around 1 ms.
I cannot set TCP_NODELAY on a UNIX socket, and I can't really
see why I get the high latency.   Is there some undocumented
option like TCP_NODELAY for UNIX STREAM connections, or are there
other tricks I can play to get the latency down ?
One process does a send(), the other one does a select() and a
recv() - and the time from the send() to the recv() is around 1 ms
which I think seems far too high.
Hints, suggestions ?
 Thank you
