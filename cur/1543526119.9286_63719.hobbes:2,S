The whole idea wasto allow "Windows-style operations with floppies for ALL

Why so ? Of course kernel should not show prompt by itself. There are need
to be "notication daemon", etc. _Please_ read thread once again. I already
described all this...
P.S. I personally do not think that such a big changes in VFS worth is but
