Then, your box has 
node 0 : cpu x 4, small memory
node 1 : cpu x 4, small memory
node 2 : big memory.
if above node 0 and node 1 disappears, it looks there are some bugs in
cpu detection.

Note:
smp_boot_data.cpu_phys_id[i] is set by acpi_parse_lsapic().
node_cpuid[j].phys_id is set by acpi_numa_processor_affinity_init().
