Attached is another traffic-image. This one is with 2.6.10 and a 3/1 split, preemtive kernel, so all 
defaults.
The first part is where I throttled the whole thing to 100 MBit in order to build up a traffic-jam ;)
When I released it, it jumped up immediately but suddenly it goes down (each pixel is one second) 
Playing around with min_free_kbytes didnt help. Where it goes up again I set lower_zone_protection 
to 1024000 and where it goes down I set it to 0 again and where it goes up the last time... guess..
Well I was only able to test this with 3500 sockets. I will try to jam up tomorrow to reach 5000 
sockets to see if that is really the reason.
