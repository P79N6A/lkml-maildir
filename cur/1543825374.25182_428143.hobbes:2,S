Fair enough, thanks for the input. I was more imagining that IO tends
to come down in decent chunks, but obviously that's still not sufficient
for some. OK.

I don't think that is the problem. set_page_dirty_lock is really
unlikely to get held up on read IO: that'd mean there were two things
writing into that page at the same time.

Well the original problem is fixed by not doing the sync_page thing in
set_page_dirty_lock. Is there any advantage to having another bit?
Considering a) it will be very unlikely that a page is locked at the
same time one would like to dirty it; and b) that would seem to imply
adding extra atomic ops and barriers to reclaim and truncate (maybe
others).

inode. Presumably PG_maplocked would pin it? I don't understand
why you've brought balance_dirty_pages into it, though.

I'm sure it could be made to work, but I don't really see the point.
If someone really wanted to do it, I guess the right way to go is have
a PG_readin counterpart to PG_writeback (or even extend PG_writeback
to PG_io)...
