I have multiple machines here that do exactly that. If "PNP OS" is set to
_Yes_, only possible boot devices are initialized. When I boot a machine
with good ol'd DOS (to use Symantec Ghost), the network cards are unusable
unless PNP OS is set to No, because no interrupt has been assigned. And yes,
these are PCI network cards.
