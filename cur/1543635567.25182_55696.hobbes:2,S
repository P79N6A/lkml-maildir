	I have to catch a plane to Beijing in the morning and I
haven't packed and the internet connectivity in the rooms there is
flakey (possibly due to their router, which is running a Linux 2.2
kernel, by the way).  So, please excuse my sloppy approach, as this
might otherwise take weeks.
	I have made a diff of linux/{net,drivers/net} against 2.5.25,
which should show my ipv4 modularization changes, although there are a
bunch of other changes that are irrelevant (unrelated changes to
various net device drivers) and some that might be relevant (e.g.,
disintegrating drivers/net/net_init.c, modularizing some media level
network protocols).
	The diff is FTPable from
	
ftp://ftp.yggdrasil.com/private/adam/kernel/netdiff-2.5.25.gz
	In case I missed something, I have also placed a complete .tar.gz
kernel snapshot at
	
ftp://ftp.yggdrasil.com/private/adam/kernel/linux-2.5.25.ygg.tar.gz
	ipv4 modularization would need to be looked over by the lkml
crowd and cleaned up before being sent to Linus.  I probably got lots
of details wrong.  As I mentioned in a previous email, I thought that
there was a modularized ipv4 already working its way to Linus from the
vger cvs tree (don't know if it still exists), which I presumed would
have had a lot more programmer power alreadya applied to it.  Perhaps
Dave Miller could comment on whether I misunderstood the situation
and, if there were other ipv4 modularization patches floating around,
whether he or anyone else knows their current status.
