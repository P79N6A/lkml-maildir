Yes, the problem with axis ranges definitely looks like that. Renato, 
could you please send me vendor id and product id of the joystick in 
question, I will send you a patch to test whether normalizing the values 
on hid-level (as we already do for several other joypads) will do the 
trick?
I have currently no idea about the incorrect number of buttons, will look 
at it a little bit more.
Thanks,
