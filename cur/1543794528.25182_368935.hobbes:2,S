I think it found a few things here and there. Requeueing had a
couple of bugs, and I think a couple of things turned up back when
AS was a new concept to the block layer.
I think it is useful to try to enforce a coherent usage of the block
interface by drivers. For example, the IDE thing may have been a non
issue, but you might imagine some io scheduler or future accounting
(or something) in the block layer actually does need the request to
go through elv_set_request / blk_init_request.
Up to you really. I'm going to rip the code out of as-iosched.c so
I just thought it may still be useful for the block layer.
Thanks,
Nick
