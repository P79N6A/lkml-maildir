True. I'd prefer to use shell, but C is okay, too. 'fsync' shell
command seems to exist on opensuse, sorry for confusion.

If I'm trying to write foo/bar/baz/file, and file/baz inodes/dentries
are written to disk, but foo is not, file still will not be found
under full name - and recovering it from lost&found is hard to do
automatically.

If disk looses data after acknowledging the write, all hope is lost.
Else I expect filesystem to preserve data I successfully synced.
     (In the b-tree split failed case I'd expect transaction commit to
     fail because new data could not be weitten; at that point
     disk+journal should still contain all the data needed for
     recovery of synced/old files, right?)

I'm trying to put my main filesystem on a SD card. hp2133 has only 4GB
internal flash, so I got 32GB SDHC. Unfortunately, SD card on hp is
very easy to eject by mistake.

Well.. I believe those POSIX programs are unsafe on removable media.
mta #1 	 	       	     	      mta #2
cat > mail1
fsync mail1
					cat > mail2
					fsync mail2
		(spool media
				removed)
					fsync . -> ERROR
					corrrectly reports
					mail2 as undelivered
fsync . -> success; first fsync cleared
      	   error condition
I'm trying to figure out why I'm loosing data on flashes. So far it
seems that both SD cards and USB flash disks have problems, and that
ext2/3 have problems... and that combination of ext2/3+flash  can't
even work in thery :-(.
