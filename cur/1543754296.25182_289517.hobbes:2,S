I don't understand. 
Which is simpler, changing an environmental variable, or adding extra 
CFLAGS to every single compile and recompiling?
In addition, in your --rpath example, the relative pathing is hardcoded
into the executable, wheras with "*" you could modify the runtime behavior
of the executable at runtime. I suppose you could change this with chrpath,
but why bother? What if you want to test out two versions of relative
libraries side by side? 
And in any case, I'm not even sure if you can change the runtime path 
to something longer than what currently exists in the executable using
chrunpath.
And finally, certain programs (glibc, for example) seem to get into to 
trouble (ie: not compile) when you use --rpath flags. So, what's the 
issue with "*"?
