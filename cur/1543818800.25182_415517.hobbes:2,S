Hi Kristen,
wanted to try this one out on my Dell Latitude CPiA and C/Dock II, but
something seems to have happened to the patch along the way:
Applying 'acpiphp: use new dock driver'
fatal: corrupt patch at line 206
Patch failed at 0002.
I tried looking at the patch itself and found nothing obvious. Also,
patching manually resulted in the same behaviour. Is this just me?
Sorry for the noise, but I'm dying to try this one out : )
Kind regards,
Chris
