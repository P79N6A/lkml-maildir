I prefer _ONE_ generic abstract implementation of a clock event, which
can be used by all hypervisors. Please keep all your wiring and ideas of
how to best emulate a i386 system away from the kernel as far as you
can.
Please sit down with the other hypervisor folks and define the five
functions you need to interact between clockevents and the particular
hypervisor and implement it once.
Then you can change and evolve your idea of how handle them best in your
hypervisor code, where it belongs.
