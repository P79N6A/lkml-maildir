The amount of time wasted on a bad scheduler is the following: 
O(Num of Times schedule is called * Number of running processes) 
When I run SPECWeb96 tests here, I see both a large number of running
process and a huge number of context switches. 
Here's a sample of the vmstat data: 
vmstat -n 1 
   procs                      memory    swap          io     system         cpu
 r  b  w   swpd   free   buff  cache  si  so    bi    bo   in    cs  us  sy  id

Notice.  24 running process and ~7000 context switches.   
That is a lot of overhead. Every second, 7000*24 goodnesses are calculated. 
Not the (20*3) that a desktop system sees.  This is a scalability issue. 
A better scheduler means better scalability.
Don't tell me benchmark data is useless.  Unless you can give me data
using a real system and where it's faults are, benchmark data is a we
have.
SPECWeb96 pushes Linux until it bleeds.  I'm telling you where it
bleeds.  You can fix it or bury your head in the sand.  It might not
be what your system is seeing today, but it will be in the future.
Would you rather fix it now or wait until someone else how thrown down
the performance gauntelet?
