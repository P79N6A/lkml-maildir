That one is being sorted out currently. The firmware itself is fine (its mere
aggregation) but there are some problems with the firmware distribution aspects
of it.
Going through checking licensing is generally a good idea. Its something that
becomes more important over time and people become more fussy about with unclear
cases (trn, tin, getty-ps for example are probably non free apps but people
assume they are 'free software'). Older versions of glibc (2.1 etc) have 
some odd licensing bits in one area
