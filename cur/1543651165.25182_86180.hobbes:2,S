This page still contains:
       Furthermore, the function do_use_fd() immediately tries to read(2)
       from the fd. If it does not do so, there is a race condition with the
       risk of losing an event before interest in it was registered.  This
       read may well return EAGAIN, which should be a cause for calling
       epoll_wait().
Am I correct in understanding that this is no longer true because epoll_ctl
inserts an event if the poll condition is met?
Furthermore, I don't think the epoll(2) page is that helpful as even an
application developer that follows lkml (ie, me) has any use of the
'waitqueue' analogy.
