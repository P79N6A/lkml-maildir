The problem appears to be that Jörg hasn't really looked at Linux in
some time, and he's used to systems that don't change architecture in
patchlevel releases, while Linux 2.6.N.M should actually have been
numbered 2.(6+2*N).M...
Jörg, any chance you might be arguing on basis of really old 2.6.X
kernels?
