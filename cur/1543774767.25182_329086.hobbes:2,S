ks> }
Most of the skb's travel from transport layer to IP layer via
ip_queue_xmit (ip_output.c).
Within this function ip_route_output_flow is the central entry point into
routing and xfrm (by means of xfrm_lookup, xfrm_find_bundle,
xfrm_bundle_create).
xfrm_bundle_create does create the destination stack. The last
dst_entry of the destination stack is the final routing entry, with
it's output function pointer (->output) set to ip_output
The other dst_entry's on top (up to nx transformations, see
the for-loop in __xfrm4_bundle_create) have set xfrm4_output, or
xfrm6_output, e.g.)
As ip_route_output_flow returns to ip_queue_xmit, the last function
call made is NF_HOOK (a macro actually), which sets dst_output as the
packets further processing function in case it traverses the hook
without being dropped.
So far you are right with your assumptions, I hope my explanation just
made it a bit clearer.

The return values are behave a little different.
xfrm4_output calls the appropriate transformation function (e.g. esp_output)
esp_output returns 0 on success, else an error occurred.
xfrm4_output itself returns NET_XMIT_BYPASS in case of no error.
If xfrm4_output would return 0, the for-loop in dst_ouput is left
immediately with a return statement, after the output function was
called.
So NET_XMIT_BYPASS keeps the destination stack running until
the final call to ip_output makes it return to ip_queue_xmit, which
returns with the result.

No it's not similiar. dst_input is not used for xfrm transformations.
Have a look at ip_local_deliver_finish. The packet enters as ESP or AH
and thus the protocol handler is xfrm4_rcv which is called via
ipprot->handler(skb)
xfrm4_rcv calls xfrm4_rcv_encap, which does all decapsulating
transformations in a do-while-loop, calling x->type-input.
When all transfromation processing is done the naked ip paket is put
back into the CPU specific packet queue by netif-rx.

The whole decapsulation is done in xfrm4_rcv_encap, except in case of
nat-traversal, where udp_rcv comes into play.
After the whole xfrm processing is done the packet is put back into the
network stack as it would look like without being ever processed by IPSec
(almost :-).
