I think this discussion might be better over on the linux-perf mailing
list. Having said that, keep reading.

Probably ... just make sure they not which kernel versions they cover as
well as the versions of any applications they reference. These kind of
docs get stale quickly as the applications and kernel change.

That too.

There should probably also be some "autotune" tools built.

Ok, let me give an example. I have a customer that wants to compare Linux
against FreeBSD on a web server. I am not a kernel hacker or network
device hacker. The web server will be hit with pretty heavy load. 
Which network tweakables should I tweak and which systems tweaks should be
done? I read through the docs on Documentation and there is sparse
information but sparse is a little better than none. My guess is I should
probably change the max window sizes from 64K to 128K and follow the
suggestion that on heavilly loaded systems the ip_local_port_range should
be expanded. What about the system itself, file-max, inode-max ...
probably should kick these up but to what? I would hate for the thing to
fall over in the benchmark test. What about super-max and in kernel, 
shmmax. I want enough resources so the thing will get through peak use
without falling over yet I do not want to waste resources either.
I think a more detailed document of the available tweaks in /proc would be
VERY useful.
