It isnt just sizes. As the size has risen rapidly the disk data rates
have increased pretty well (factor of about 100 over an MFM disk 386)
but the seek time has shifted by a factor of 10. This has a huge impact
on the whole basic theory of things like paging in applications versus
doing a streaming preload of the code/data.
It also has a big impact on how swap is managed - it is pretty much as
cheap now to swap out 2Mb as 4K
