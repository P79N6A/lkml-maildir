Maybe yes, maybe no.

Note that these are just noise -- new code being verbose when looking for an optional feature.
The fact that hitting the power button a bunch of times
to make the system move along suggests some sort of missing interrupt problem --
most likely the timer itself.

[  387.279576] Clocksource tsc unstable (delta = 370195339890 ns)

does CONFIG_NO_HZ=n make a difference?

does CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS=n make a difference?
does "irqpoll" make any difference?
does "notsc" make any difference?
does "idle=poll" make any difference?
