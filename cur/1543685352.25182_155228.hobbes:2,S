Hi,
This is no bug report, thanks to the fast improvment of the 2.6 kernel tree :)
after the cvs checkout today 2.6 compiled without problem, after rebooting and 
doing some compile tests (kernel & mozilla) it didn't panic and it is so 
wonderful to see it work so more responsive than the 2.4.20-ck on my old 
k6-III 550 Mhz Box :) I can really *see* the difference when I switch 
desktops in KDE ... this is just amazing!
