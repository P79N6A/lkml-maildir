It was just a thought - it just seemed a reasonable thing to test for, since 
the call can fail. 
I didn't check the lib code, so I imagined that their might be some glibc 
munging of the syscall output. man gettimeofday sez, inter alia:
       EINVAL Timezone (or something else) is invalid.
       EFAULT One of tv or tz  pointed  outside  your  accessible
              address space.
As you pointed out, EINVAL doesn't seem too likely, and I can't see a pointer 
problem. So it looks like something else.
