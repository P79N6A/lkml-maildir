 > io_submit() is incapable of returning operation success notifications.
Exactly, that's why i proposed a new submission interface. ie, to
allow io_submit() to support the "always return async, even IF the
operation has ALREADY completed" paradigm, and another interface
to support the "return synchronous completions on submission"
paradigm.

Fine (see interfaces defined above).

Yes, and we've moved past that, since there are other conditions which
are not as rare.

Great...i am glad that we atleast agree that the interface is necessary,
tho maybe not on its makeup.
The issue i brought up (bcopy threshold), is not a non-blocking issue,
and the above is not the "traditional", nor the correct way of dealing w/
it. The app should NOT need to make multiple sys-calls to initiate
the io. By far the majority of the existly network aio api's simply
return an indication of the immediate/synchronous completion as a
return indication from a *single* submission routine. There is no
reason why we cannot, also.
