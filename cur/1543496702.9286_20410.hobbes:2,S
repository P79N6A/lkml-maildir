    That's what BIOS and e.g. Hardware Info proggy say.
So other programs than the Linux kernel successfully do IDENTIFY DRIVE?

    Nope. Tried also 2.2.1.
And hdparm -I ? And 2.0.34 ?
    The other IDE-devices (four) are detected OK, this 13GB hd is giving
    trouble (in detection phase only). It has ~13GB ext2 partition and
    it works just fine.
    Except from the fact that it has only 630 files,
    4GB used, and fragmention level is 25%... how came?
Large files are always fragmented. See the comment in e2fsck:
        /*
         * Simplistic fragmentation check.  We merely require that the
         * file be contiguous.  (Which can never be true for really
         * big files that are greater than a block group.)
         */
[I know nothing about disk I/O - only about disk geometries,
and the ridiculous geometries that you reported attracted
my attention. But I like to learn.
Andre answered: this is an ATA/33 vs ATA/66 problem.
I do not really understand the answer.
Sometimes there are problems with DMA/66 when the disk allows it,
and the BIOS enables it, but the cable is no good.
However, this IBM-DTTA-351350 is not a DMA/66 drive.
Moreover, the problem seems to be only in the IDENTIFY DRIVE command.]
