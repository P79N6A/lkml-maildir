Neither is cpusets - doing resource control is pretty much the same
problem on SMP as NUMA. So I don't really see your point.

Right ... the problems you're attacking aren't *exactly* the same - but
they're still close enough, that especially when programming them in
combination, it seems silly to have 2 separate interfaces.

Perhaps the main thing that ends up shared would be the interface - and
I agree that adding cpus_allowed is wholly insufficient. However, I think
it's foolish to go ahead and press one resource control method interface
into the kernel without carefully considering the possibilities for a
unified interface first - this is important to get right ... interfaces
are too hard to change afterwards (see current discussion re libnuma
for a perfect example).

That's up to Andrew ... but personally I'd rather see the interface issues
thrashed out first. My real concern is that it doesn't go into mainline or
a distro yet, but quite frankly, another couple of weeks isn't going to 
kill anyone, so I don't see the point.
