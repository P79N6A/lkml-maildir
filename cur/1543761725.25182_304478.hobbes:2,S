It's not that trivial.
- You need to know how to modify your initramfs to do it;
- You might have to (learn how to) set up an initramfs just for this;
- Your image might not be stored in a swap partition. For Suspend2, it
can potentially in a swap file or (soon) an ordinary file;
- Finding which partition to look in for the signature might be non
trivial (labels in fstab). You'd want to hard code it or (perferably)
copy a config file from the root (or other) partition;
- Having addressed the above issues, you still need to add code to read
the swap header, parse it to find the header, read the header from the
image, parse it and obtain the kernel version of the saved image.
If your image is not stored in a swap partition, you probably can't
mount the fs the image is stored on, because doing so will replay the
image and make resuming unsafe, so this approach is less trivial without
knowing exactly which disk blocks and device IDs to use (and using dd to
access them).
On top of these, we have two implementations, so you'll want to check
for the signatures of both.
That said, I am considering making something like what you're saying:
exposing methods of testing whether an image exists and an entry through
which you can get Suspend to erase an image via a proc (eventually
sysfs) entry. This will allow something like what you're saying to be
controlled from userspace.
Regards,
Nigel
