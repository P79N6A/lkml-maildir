OK.  No lines reporting handoff problems in any of the boots.  The only 
boot in which I still have a keyboard is when I comment out the OHCI 
handoff.  I saved dmesg's of all boots, and ran diffs against them.  The 
uncommented handoffs and the EHCI commented handoff are essentially the 
same (where the OHCI handoff code still executes in both).  The relevant 
(diff'd) sections are:
