MPC106UM, section 8.1.3.1: PCI to System Memory Read Buffer (PCMRB)
MPC107UM, section 12.1.3.1.1: PCI to Local Memory Read Buffer (PCMRB)
It's not a big cache, but it's large enough to hold the transmit
descriptor of a pcnet32 ethernet. It's easy to miss this in the manual,
and I only noticed it when my first 7450 board wouldn't work with NFS
root.
