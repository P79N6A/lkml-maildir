I agree. I think I only moved it around.
But I don't like the HARDIRQ_OFFSET change. If I understand the code 
correctly it checks that there is no hardirq reentrancy, i.e. the count 
is 0 or 1. Shifted to the appropriate position for the actual test.
I'd either leave it as it is or use "1*HARDIRQ_OFFSET" - otherwise the 
information that the count should be less of equal one is lost.
