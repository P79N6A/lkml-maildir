At this time the following code in drivers/ide/ide-cd.c:cdrom_read_toc()
is executed:
	/* Try to get the total cdrom capacity and sector size. */
	stat = cdrom_read_capacity(drive, &toc->capacity, &sectors_per_frame,
				   sense);
	if (stat)
		toc->capacity = 0x1fffff;
	set_capacity(info->disk, toc->capacity * sectors_per_frame);
Obviously, with the tray open cdrom_read_capacity() won't succeed,
therefore toc->capacity will be set to 0x1fffff.

0x1fffff * 2048/512 == 8388604
Your background program is keeping the device open, which prevents
revalidation of capacity and other media information on subsequent
device opens.
When HAL polls CD-ROM devices to detect newly inserted media, it does
not keep the device open forever - instead, it opens and closes the
device every time.  Your program should either do the same thing, or
just depend on HAL events.
