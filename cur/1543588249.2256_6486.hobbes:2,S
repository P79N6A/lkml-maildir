It's already there - the turbo packet interface (PACKET_RX_RING sockopt).
Very nice and fast.  Direct transfer to mmapped memory.

With the RX_RING you can poll a memory location in the mmapped memory
to detect whether there are new packets.  You basically only perform
a system call (poll/select) if there's nothing more to do.
