SNI's ASICPCI chipset used for example in the RM200C features 15 16mb
windows for each of which byteorder swapping can be configured independantly.
We neither support such a mapping feature in our current APIs nor is
having drivers rely on the presence of such a feature a good idea unless
it's present in all machines of a certain architecture.

The SGI IOC3 is one example for such a card.  Registers in PCI config
space are little endian as per PCI spec.  Other registers are big endian.
Anybody PDP endian ;-)
