It depends.
If you're making interprocess calls to call the GPL code,
I suspect you won't have to make your code GPL.
OTOH, if you /link/ against a GPL shared library, you will
have to GPL the source of your program (that is, you'll have
to give it to the people who receive the binary from you).
Mind that lots of the "system" libraries are under the
somewhat more free LPGL...
regards,
Rik
