I have tagged and tarballed Sparse 0.4.1, now available from
<
http://kernel.org/pub/software/devel/sparse/dist/sparse-0.4.1.tar.gz>,
with sha1sum `14085c5317cd7f2c8392fb762969906fa91888ef`.
This bugfix release fixes a Sparse assertion which recent Linux kernels started
triggering, along with a few other fixes.
Several outstanding patches exist which need to go into the Sparse tree, but
this release does not contain those patches because people wouldn't have
had the opportunity to test them enough.

Christopher Li (1):
      Perform local label lookup

      Handle ignored attribute malloc
