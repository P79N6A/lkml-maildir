You asked about Linux 2.4.18, and I was speaking
strictly for it. This is after all linux-netdev :).

Again, youre limiting the number of connnection requests
that are allowed to wait in the *accept* queue, where
we move to once we're ESTABLISHED.  You arent limiting
a request sitting in the SYN queue.

Er, complete the 3 way handshake? If the client gets the syn/ack, it
should send a SYN in response, and move to ESTABLISHED state. If the
server gets an ack back from the client, we process the ack. Our
processing involves moving the request from the syn queue to the
accept queue. Should the accept queue be full (which could occur
anytime - eg it could have occurred *after* the server recvd this
SYN) we would drop the request.  Should the client then send data,
it would get a RST, letting it know our side (srvr) has had to
throw the connection away.  Its quite possible that the accept queue
clears and a request can be moved from the SYN queue to the
accept queue in the interval of the handshake being completed (?)
If we get a SYN, it doesn't seem unreasonable that we enter
SYN_RCVD state :).
