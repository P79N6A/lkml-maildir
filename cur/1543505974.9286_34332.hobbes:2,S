Come on.  You know very well that by pretending that each directory is a mount
point you get this containment behavior that you claim "doesn't make sense".
Allowing hard-links across those pseudo-mount-points is probably too much
trouble, so only hardlinks within a directory should be allowed.
Hard-links within a quota-space are not as easy to handle properly as it seems
since you have to somehow deal with the case where you suddenly divide one
quota-space into two.
