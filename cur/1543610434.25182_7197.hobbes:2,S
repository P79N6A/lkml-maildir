First of all: 
This is offtopic for the ___linux kernel___ mailing list.
Nevertheless:
VIA686B is the southbridge and has no memory controller.
The VIA694X-northbridge has 6 memory banks.
if the 3rd and 4th module are single sided its ok. 
If the 3rd module is double sided you cannot plugin a 4th module.
