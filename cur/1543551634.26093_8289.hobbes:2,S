For 2.2.x kernels, grab the latest Don Becker tulip driver from
ftp://ftp.scyld.com/pub/network/test/
  This currently works the best
with FA310TX cards (PNIC chips).  Beware -- you need pci-scan.[ch] and
k*.h from the previous dir (/pub/network) in order to build properly.
For 2.4.x kernels, that remains an open bug...  I need to merge the bits
from Don Becker's tulip.c driver into 2.4.x.  (patches welcome!)
