   They dont all get open right either ;) And yes a lot get read/write wrong
   or assume incorrectly that single opener == single threaded read/write.
Um, open's of char and block devices grab the BKL in fs/devices.c and
fs/block_dev.c.  So I believe the open routines of the character and
block devices already have the BKL on entry.  Am I missing something
here?
read/write SMP issues for device drivers is definitely an issue; I've
added it to the list.
