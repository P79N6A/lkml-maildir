hi,
sorry if this is not the right place, please point me there.
I am using 2.2.9 as a NFS client, 2.0.36 is the server. Both are a Debian
2.1 installation with no (NFS related) self compiled packages. 
I frequently get messages like
Jun 15 21:56:49 debian kernel: nfs_safe_remove: VmWare/.nfs5213903b00000001
inode busy?? i_count=2, i_nlink=1 
Jun 15 21:56:49 debian kernel: NFS: can't silly-delete
VmWare/.nfs5213903b00000001, error=-116 
is this something to worry about? I haven't had any data corruption yet.
( /home is mounted via NFS )
