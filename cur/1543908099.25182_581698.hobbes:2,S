"Other things are broken too".  Great argument :-)

Sequence points order *all* side effects; sequence points exist in the
domain of the abstract sequential model of the C language only.  The
compiler translates that to machine code that is equivalent to that C
code under the "as-if" rule; but this is still in that abstract model,
which doesn't include things such as SMP, visibility by I/O devices,
store queues, etc. etc.

You cannot flush all MMIO writes with reads; this is a PCI-specific
thing.  And even then, you need more than just the read itself: you
have to make sure the read completed and returned data.

And this proves what?  Lots of stuff "works" by accident.
