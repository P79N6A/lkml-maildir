Linux is a good Unix.  if adding "enterpriseness" means violating its 
Unixness, then yes, the goals are bullshit.  in particular, the kind
of extensive, kernel-based auditing and accounting some people talk about, 
as well as the complete evisceration of the Unix design for security, 
would make Linux no Unix at all.  that would be very bad, and indeed Multics
is a fine example of the kind of history we should not repeat.
