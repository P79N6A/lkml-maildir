Well, there exist USB controllers with Intel/Motorola style bus interfaces, to
be used in e.g. set top boxes without a PCI bus. I think you can glue them

USB plug-in cards for ISA, but it's possible.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
