Reiserfs cannot be used efficiently with flash, as it uses block size 4K
(by default) and usual flash block size is in range 64K - 256K.
Also reiserfs does not use compression, that would be very nice of it
:), because flash has limited number of erase cycles per block (in range
100.000) and it is about three times as expensive as SDRAM.
So, it is better to use something more convenient. For instance jffs2.
But, if you are still want to use reiserfs for flash device, you should
do at least the following: 
(1) Make the journal substantial smaller of size.
(2) Don't turn tails off. This is useful to prolong flash live.
Regards.
