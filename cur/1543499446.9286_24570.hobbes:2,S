taking the minor device number and adding it to the block number would be
simple enough, but mathematically adds very little randomness.  i haven't
seen any benchmarks that are improved by keeping the device in the hash
function calculations.  can you tell me why you think it should stay?

yes, there was a lot of cutting and pasting when i created this patch :)
i've been thinking about how to generalize this code a bit... there are a
lot of variables that would need to be passed into and out of such a
routine.  we can simplify by putting all the hash table metadata into a
struct, and passing its address.  if you think it is acceptible to use the
simple "num_physpages" based heuristic for most hash tables, that can be
included too.
