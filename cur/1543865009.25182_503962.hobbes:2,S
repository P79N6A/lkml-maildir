Is an x86_64 EFI firmware required to have 2 entry points, one x86_64
and one in ia32 mode ? If that's not the case, it means that an i386
kernel won't be able to work correctly on an EFI powered x86_64 box...

Have you any objection to the second patch I posted? It's not only a
matter of passing arguments, ia64 does quite a lot of things in its
wrapper functions. I can easily imagine that such additional work
could be added in the i386 wrappers if EFI becomes more widely used.
