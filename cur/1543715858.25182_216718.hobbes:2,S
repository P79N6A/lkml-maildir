No, it doesn't have to be written in assembly. If that was the case, I  
wouldn't have managed to get it working under a variety of compiler  
versions already. So long as assemblers honour the directives, we're okay.  
Of course I'll freely admit that hand coding would probably result in  
nicer, tidier and maybe faster code, and you would know that it was doing  
the right thing. In the long time I would prefer to do that. But right now  
I'm being a pragmatist: .c works, I don't know x86 assembly and don't have  
the time to learn it and the code is still changing a little, so I'll  
delay making a .S file for now.
Please, forgive me!
Regards,
Nigel
