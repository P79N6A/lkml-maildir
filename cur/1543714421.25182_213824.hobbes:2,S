I'm a great believer in scripting this stuff out, saves me from my own 
typu's.  My "makeit" script seems to have worked ok, and it does 
seperate makes for bzImage, modules, and modules_install.  However, 
IIRC it does do some other work between making modules, and the make 
modules_install.  I had to re-arrange things a bit so the final 
depmod was clean.
I don't know if this is how you are supposed to do it, but here is how 
I do it, please critique:
------------makeit-----------
#!/bin/sh
## this script assumes you have downloaded, unpacked and linked 
kernel-whatever.version
## First, set the version string to match the Makefile setting
VER=2.6.5-bk1
# I've re-arranged this to be one contiguous command line, because 
# this way if there is an error, it dies right there instead of making
# you scroll back 700k in the shell's history to check for errors.
# And, due to changes in the 2.6 way of doing things, the System.map
# stuff has been moved to a point BEFORE the make modules_install
# because it (apparently) now has a self-contained depmod command.
# Also, one should make sure the DEPMOD declaration in the Makefile
# is NOT hard coded pathwise, so it will find the newer, 2.6 version
# of depmod, that bit me several times.

If the above is incorrect, I'd appreciate some pointers on how to 
improve it.
