OK, Paul and I knocked our heads together until we got the behavior and
interfaces ironed out if not to our mutual satisfaction at least to a
workable level. Paul's next tree:
    % git clone git://git.infradead.org/users/pcmoore/lblnet-2.6_next
has the current version. There are a couple interesting things going on.
    - /smack/nltype is gone. It never lived up to its promise and is no
      longer required to determine the labeling scheme.
    - /smack/netlabel replaces the earlier /smack/slhost because it better
      describes what it gets used for.
    - The "@" label (pronounced "web") has been added to the list of special
      labels. A packet with the web label will get delivered anywhere. A
      network address specified to have the web label can be written to by
      any process. Processes can not have the web label.
    - An incoming packet from an address in the netlabel list that has a 
CIPSO
      label attached will still use the label from the CIPSO packet.
    - An unlabeled packet coming from an address in the netlabel list 
will be
      given the label associated with that address.
    - A process that wants to send a packet to an address on the list needs
      write access to the label associated with that address. The packet 
will
      be sent unlabeled if it is allowed.
So, if I want my old Sony to be treated as a single-label host with the
label "Pop" I can say:
    # echo 192.168.1.102/32 Pop > /smack/netlabel
If I want the secondary network for my development machines to be 
single-label
    # echo 192.168.2.0/24 Snap > /smack/netlabel
And if I want everyone to be able to communicate with my spam server
    # echo 207.69.188.187 '@' > /smack/netlabel
