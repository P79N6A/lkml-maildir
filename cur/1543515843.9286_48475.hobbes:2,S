I managed applying that one (in the kernel souce with -p4...) but at aty128fb
initialisation, I can only see garbage, and same under other consols, clear
as no effect, but there is no problem to run X...
I send that mail, and return to the console, if the problem got solved, I write
another mail...
Not sure about the clear command (blind typo) but quite :-)
Is there any requirements for it other than compiling it in the kernel?
Please, don't cc to me: I am on the list...
Thanks,
