Both ramfs and tmpfs do what you're asking for.  If you are booting
from an initial ramdisk, it's possible to copy the contents of your
ramdisk into a ramfs or tmpfs filesystem at boot time, change roots
with the pivot_root utility, and then throw away the ramdisk.  See
Documentation/initrd.txt for more information on this.
