Understood, but the way PCs (pronounced PissCz <g>) are going, there's
practically NO irqs free.  If I enable apci (or is it acpi?), It uses irq 9. 
Lesse, if we don't want irq conflicts (most pc hardware I've worked with do
not use IRQs above 15) I have 10 and 11 available.  I have 3 if I disable
the irport (which is disabled currently).  Lets assume I want to use 2
pcmcia adapters.  Cardbus slot 1 has 10 and 2 has 11.  The first inserted
card could get irq 3.  The 2nd gets what irq?
Does yenta/pci_socket allocate the irq to the controller, or does this come
from the bios (I'm going to assume that it's set since I was able to load
the modules after loading the one for my sound card and they both had the
same irq).

Oops.  According to lspci -v, the maestro card already has irq5 before the
cardbus slots get allocated an irq.

Seems a little harry.  The hardware that is.  pcmcia and cardbus cards would
be the equivilant of ISA and PCI cards having the same connector.
If pcmcia card is inserted, it gets an ISA irq.  The same slot has another
IRQ assigned to it but not being used.

Interesting.

Actually, not for me, but that laptop (a kiwi opennote 680t, piece of shit I
might add.  Its the one I use at work) uses an older kernel 2.3.3x.  It has
an omega micro pci-to-pcmcia controller.
By the way, in yenta_init(), I tried commenting out pci_set_power_state()
once and it never activated the cardbus card (At that time, that was the
only card I was testing)  I'll try making yenta_init a nothing call and see
if it still locks up.
Another BTW.  After removing the card (physically or logically doesn't
matter) and re-inserting it causes the system to lockup a little bit later
for no reason, keyboard will respond to sysrq-p.
