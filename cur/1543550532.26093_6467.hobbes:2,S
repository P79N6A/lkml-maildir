Interesting. That might mean that something was sleeping on
bdflush (kflushd), while at the same time kflushd was sleeping
and never woke up (at least, not until you sent it a signal).
Hmm, now that you mention it...
The reschedule point in flush_dirty_buffers() looks suspect.
Are we /sure/ that a task going to sleep there is in
TASK_RUNNING mode?

Rik
