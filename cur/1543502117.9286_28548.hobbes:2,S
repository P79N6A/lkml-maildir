Hello,
[1.] One line summary of the problem: 
GPF and 'attempt to access beyond end of device' errors
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
last night one of our servers had a protection fault followed, as you
can see, by an 'attempt to access beyond end of device' error, which
repeated for about 2hours until the server was rebooted. there were
errors on the root partition which were corrected by e2fsck.
server was up for about 10 days.
[3.] Keywords: kernel
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
Linux version 2.2.10 (root@Cnn.CODEC.Ro.) (gcc version egcs-2.91.66

[5.] Output of Oops.. message (if applicable) with symbolic information
     resolved: (syslogd innterpreted the oops so I think this is good)

[6.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the
     problem (if possible)
sorry.

after the GPF there were 5 quiet seconds and after that is begun
to print a lot of:

after this there are a lot of '0's in the log.
the kernel is plain 2.2.10 with 'spot' module inserted.
hope this helps.
