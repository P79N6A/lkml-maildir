i'm not quite sure what you mean. the timestamps used to measure
max_delay look like this:
                ... set up poll fd struct  ....
		poll_enter = jack_get_microseconds ();
		if (poll (driver->pfd, nfds, driver->poll_timeout) < 0) {
			if (errno == EINTR) {
				printf ("poll interrupt\n");
				// this happens mostly when run
				// under gdb, or when exiting due to a signal
				if (under_gdb) {
					goto again;
				}
				*status = -2;
				return 0;
			}
			
			jack_error ("ALSA: poll call failed (%s)",
				    strerror (errno));
			*status = -3;
			return 0;
			
		}
		poll_ret = jack_get_microseconds ();
		if (extra_fd < 0) {
			if (driver->poll_next && poll_ret > driver->poll_next) {
				*delayed_usecs = poll_ret - driver->poll_next;
			} 
			driver->poll_last = poll_ret;
			driver->poll_next = poll_ret + driver->period_usecs;
			driver->engine->transport_cycle_start (driver->engine, 
							       poll_ret);
		}
you can view this here in context:
   
http://jackit.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/lxr/http/source/drivers/alsa/alsa_driver.c
  
(its at line 1195)
the max_delay value is taken from "delayed_usecs" above. each backend
(the one shown is the ALSA driver) sets this every time its "wait"
function is called; jackd collects the figures and these days manages
them as a set of statistics.
as you can see, poll_enter is available, but we don't use it for much
at all (mostly just some information in the very unusual event that
poll times out).
jack_get_microseconds() uses the cycle timer to compute elapsed time,
there is no system call involved.
