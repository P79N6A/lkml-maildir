Can you explain a bit more? If multi_mode needs taskfile perhaps we
need to kill compilation? [Attached patch probably is not enough,
AFAICS multimode can be turned on without this config option, but it
should be clear what I mean.]

Okay, it is probably not the best help text ever.
If I want safest possible configuration for 2.6.0, is
CONFIG_TASKFILE_IO=n, CONFIG_IDEDISK_MULTI_MODE=n and hdparm -c 1
/dev/hda good idea?
