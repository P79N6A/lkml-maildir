Just tested (plain curiosity).
via82cxxx average result @533MHz:
/dev/hda:
 Timing cached reads:   232 MB in  2.00 seconds = 115.93 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:   64 MB in  3.12 seconds =  20.54 MB/sec
pata_via average result @533MHz:
/dev/sda:
 Timing cached reads:   234 MB in  2.01 seconds = 116.27 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:   82 MB in  3.05 seconds =  26.92 MB/sec
Same 2.6.23-rc1-git11 kernel. 
Yes - constant 6MB/s difference (31%). Cool.
