But it is not protecting a cpu from going away, it is protecting ALL
cpus from coming or leaving. In that respect it is much more like a
cpu_online_map lock rather than a data structure refcount.
It really is just like a reentrant rw semaphore... I don't see the
point of the name change, but I guess we don't like reentrant locks so
calling it something else might go down better with Linus ;)
