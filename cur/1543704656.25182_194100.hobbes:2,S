That should not matter any more.
For what it is worth, the problem appears to be fixed, and in the
wierdest way.
I booted kernel 2.4 without ide-scsi, and it failed to work.  Then I
booted 2.4 with ide-scsi, and things were working again.
The burner could not read the last three CDs I burned, one CD/RW, and
the other CD/R's on kernel 2.6.1 and the other on a Windows machine.
Just for the hell of it, I blanked and burned the CD/RW.
Instantly, I could read all of the "problem" CDs.
I booted 2.4 without ide-scsi, and it worked.
I booted 2.6.1 without ide-scsi, and it worked.
It's as if doing that blank and burn operation "fixed" something about
the drive.
I'm hoping to try a few reboots to make sure this drive is working
before fully deciding things are OK, but it certainly looks that way.
