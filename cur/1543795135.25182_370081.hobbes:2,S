Dmitry,
there's a bug report filed against Debian's udev. You can read it here:
	
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=340202
The bug report, however, states that the problem is caused by udev under
all variants of kernel 2.6.15. I'm writing this mail while running
2.6.15-rc1 and the mouse definitely works. Do you have any other hint?
Seems to me like the bug report is only half the truth... 
Regards,
	Marc
