That's because there might something as:
err = -EPERM;
if(error) { goto out; }
do something;
if(error2) { goto out; }
do something more;
if(error3) { goto out; }
Is shorter than:
if(error) { err = -EPERM; goto out; }
do something;
if(error2) { err = -EPERM; goto out; }
do something more;
if(error3) { err = -EPERM; goto out; }
>Is there any particular reason why the former is preferred?  Is the compiler
To keep it short. Because it might have been worse than just err =xxx:
if(error) {
    do this and that;
    and more;
    even more;
    more more;
    goto out;
}
Repeating that over and over is not that good. So we wrap it a little bit to do
a "staircase" deinitialization:
err = -EPERM;
if(error) { goto this_didnot_work; }
...
err = -ENOSPC;
if(error) { goto that_didnot_work; }
this_didnot_work:
  all uninitializations needed
that_didnot_work:
  all other uninit's
  return err;
So to summarize, it's done to reduce code whilst keeping the error code around
until we actually leave the function.
