[catching up with vast backlog]
On Thu, 4 Dec 2003, viro@parcelfarce.linux.theplanet.co.uk mused:

ISTM that this could be done quite easily with a hacked-up libcpp that
does token pasting and #include processing, but does *not* process #if
statements themselves.
Preprocess every translation unit in the kernel with that, and grep each
of them for every exported symbol in turn, and bingo. :)
I'll have a hack sometime this weekend if nobody else gets around to it.
(Of course, this will say that stuff in #if 0's and other #ifdef
branches that can't be reached is in fact used, but such code isn't
common.)

Hang on, surely you can tell which symbols in modules are exported just
by looking for expansions of EXPORT_SYMBOL{_GPL}? Why is this bit hard?
I think the problem is you're trying to compile rather than doing a
hacked -E :) we don't need to compile for this, just do most of the
preprocessing phase.
