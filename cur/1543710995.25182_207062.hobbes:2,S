"vacation" style recipes for maildrop or procmail do most of the parts
you'd need - sort people's mail into one folder "no-consent", if they
send a patch, ask them for permission, if they consent, drop their mail
address into the DB so their mail is sorted into
"address-export-allowed". Change names as you will.
Just a suggestion to counted the "huge" overhead. It is overhead and
costs time without doubt.
