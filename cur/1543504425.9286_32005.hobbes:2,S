Hi,
Here's a patch that doesn't work as intended.  The idea is to find all
'parallel communication' PCI cards, but that doesn't happen.  The card I
have in this machine seems to have class
((PCI_CLASS_COMMUNICATION_PARALLEL << 8) | 2), and pci_find_class just
does a straight compare with no masking.
So I guess what I'm really asking is: what does the LSB byte in the class
mean?
Tim.
