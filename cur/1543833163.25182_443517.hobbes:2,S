Hi Roman,
I have been practising Linux for more than a decade now.
	
I am working with standard configurations.
	
As standard configurations for mm-kernels differ from mainline kernels, I often have to disable 1 or even 2 modules. In this case (jumping from 2.6.17.4 to 2.6.18-rc1-mm1) I had to disable „Sony Laptop Extras.“
The patch for timer.c has been proven to be responsible for boot errors, unbootable machines and keyboard mismatches in kernel 2.6.17-mm plus 2.6.18-rc1.
As outline attachments I add two standard configs, one for a P 4 machine which is working fine, one for a P 3 machine which hangs up the machine during the boot process. If you still find out that the error is mine I declare you king.
But the indices offer enough pressure that this issue is definitely one closely connected to that patch for timer.c.
I do not get any boot prompt.
It stops somewhere at the USB initialization I guess.
But I will have a closer look on this and give you another feedback in about two hours.
Regards
Uwe
