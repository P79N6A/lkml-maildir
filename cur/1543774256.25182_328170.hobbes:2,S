Hmm, actually, this is still pretty bad.  Shouldn't the suspend fail
with "power management not implemented for device aic9xxx?" rather than
crashing and burning?
Also, who is the aic9xxx maintainer?  I could not find any reference to
it at all in MAINTAINERS.
Finally, is there an authoritative, up to date driver developers guide
for the SCSI subsystem, like the one for ALSA?
TIA,
Lee
