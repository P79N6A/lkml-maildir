Hi,
Hopefully this is the correct list for asking this type of question. If not
than please direct me to the proper list.
With kernel 2.4.9 whenever I mounted a vfat partition the executable bits
of the files were not set, as a result in rox-filer I was getting the
proper association to the application. 
But since kernel 2.4.10 onwards the
executable bits of all the files in vfat partions are set. Due to this in
rox-filer I get all the files as executables and I can not open any file in
proper association. Any way to unset the executable bits on vfat partition
mounting ?
I have got the following in my /etc/fstab :
/dev/hda6       /mnt/funstuff   vfat    defaults,errors=remount-ro,users 0       0
At present I am on kernel 2.4.12 with ext3 patch applied from :
ftp://perlsupport.com/pub/linux/kernel/ext3-0.9.12-2.4.12.patch.gz
Thanks in advance.
Warm Regards
Peace
