I've always had little confidence in the elf loader.  The problem is
complex, the code quality is not high and the consequences of an error are
severe.
I guess others realise this, and the bad guys have probably already
"audited" the code for us, but still.
I'll merge your additional checks for testing and would encourage you to
keep looking at the problem, thanks.
