yeah, my sblive is a bit busted; my front line-out jack is broken and
only gives 1 channel, hence I use the back line-out. The alsa driver has
some fancy channel routing stuff in there that doesn't work out of the
box for me.
I once made a patch so that the front and back channels were inverted
but I lost it somewhere. And since I'm a lazy ass I kept using the OSS
driver. It's not as if I actually use my sblive for anything else but
the occasional mp3. But I guess I have to go and figure that channel
routing stuff out once again.
