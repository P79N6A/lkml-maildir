When the patch gets added to a git repository, they end up
having your name on it, because the author is determined
from the person who sent the patch.
For the patches where Jim is the main author, you should put a 
From: James K Lewis <jklewis@us.ibm.com>
into the first line of the email body. That will make the
scripts do the right thing. The order of the Signed-off-by:
lines is used is independant from authorship and should
list the name of the submitter last.
