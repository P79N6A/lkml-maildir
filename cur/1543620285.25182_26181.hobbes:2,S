The underlying issue is an attempt to find a magic trick that will make
hard synchronization problems go away. The result is usually something that
makes hard synchronization problems more obscure. Ingo points to a case,
apparently triggered only by a wierd benchmark artefact where a queue of very
short term operations builds up a queue of expensive process reschedules. The
problem is that the same semaphore is used to for slow and fast operations
and the solution is to split them apart somehow or to conclude that its not
an important case. 
As Ingo points out, you need some actual positive results here, not a plausibility
argument.
