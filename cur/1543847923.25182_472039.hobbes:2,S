With Nicks patch I can use arch_alloc_page instead of page_set_stable,
but I can still not use arch_free_page instead of page_set_unused
because it is done before the check for reserved pages. If reserved
pages go away or the arch_free_page call would get moved after the check
I could replace page_set_unused as well. So with Nicks patch we are only
halfway there..
