In my case the choice of IO scheduler affected the result of "hdparm -t" 
significantly. With Deadline I got identical result with NCQ and wihout NCQ. 
It was only with CFQ when I got worse results with NCQ than without it.
What might be the reason CFQ+NCQ gived so much worse throughput with "hdparm 
-t"?
