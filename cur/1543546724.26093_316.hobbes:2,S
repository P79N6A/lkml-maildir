Is it just me, or is both last_processor and processor always going to
equal 0 on UP, and no matter how long you delay setting of last_processor
to processor, you always going to be setting a zeroed variable to a zeroed
variable? What would you gain by un-#ifdefing last_process and processor
on UP?
