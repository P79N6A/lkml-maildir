Greets,
I'm getting an error "No module aic7xxx found for kernel 2.6.0-test9".  Now
I know that aic7xxx is an aliased module in /etc/modules.conf.  Of course I
can remove it; but what are the repurcussions of removing it.
Also, in the kernle config, I've got scsi support turned on as well as the
aic7xxx selected as a module.  What am I missing here?
