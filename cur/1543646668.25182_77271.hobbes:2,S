Beware here. The kinds of time/space tradeoffs important to you are
absolutely *not* apparent from "normal" testing. -You- are the embedded
developers and users. The onus is on you to find space consumption
problems visible in embedded environments.
Yes, I am highly concerned about space. But that is not enough to
address your needs. My space consumption concerns are largely
ZONE_NORMAL consumption and data structure proliferation. This is a
very different matter from boottime and absolute space consumption.
You will not be serviced by my own efforts to combat space consumption.
You must take action yourselves to provide both problem reports and
code to address these needs. But this is a valid activity and a
worthwhile direction to pursue. If you take action, it will be heeded.
