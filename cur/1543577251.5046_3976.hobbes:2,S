I just submitted an article entitled "Why We Should All Test the New Linux
Kernel" to
http://advogato.org
the article is at
http://advogato.org/article/224.html
If you're not familiar with it, Advogato is an online community for Free
Software developers.  I would venture to say any Linux kernel developer would
qualify for a membership.
I hope you like what I have to say.  Perhaps if you'd like to encourage a friend
to test the kernel you could forward them the URL.
