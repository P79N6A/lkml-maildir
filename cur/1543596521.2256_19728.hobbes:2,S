I noticed that ps still relies on device numbers to determine tty, since
/proc/*/stat only exports the device number. Is there any way to get the
device name? I noticed that it is not present in tty_struct anywhere
(proc_pid_stat() uses task->tty->device, which is a kdev_t).
This would be useful to consider if we ever intend to create real
unnumbered character/block devices.
