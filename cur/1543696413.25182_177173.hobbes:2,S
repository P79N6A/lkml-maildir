Subject: Bug (?) in subsystem kset refcounts
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I hesitate to say this is definitely a bug, since it might be intended 
behavior.  But it is rather strange.
Subsystems included an embedded kset, which itself includes an embedded 
kobject and so is subject to reference counting.  Whenever a kobject 
belonging to the kset is destroyed, the kset's reference count is 
decremented.  However, kobjects can be added to a kset via the three 
macros
	kobj_set_kset_s, kset_set_kset_s, and subsys_set_kset
and these do _not_ increment the kset's reference count.  As a result, the 
reference count only goes down, not up, quickly becoming negative.
Now maybe this doesn't matter -- if subsystems are intended to be
permanent (i.e., never released), for example.  But it provokes a warning
message from kernels that check for reference counts going below zero,
appears to be unintended, and may cause other problems as well.
The patch below is offered as a possible solution.  I don't know that it's 
the right one, but at least it prevents the unwanted warning messages.
