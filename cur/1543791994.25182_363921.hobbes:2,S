I appreciate that, but was hoping to see the call graph for the deadlock,
with sysrq-t.
See, one fix might be to take the lock_cpu_hotplug() call out of
__cpufreq_driver_target() and move it higher up the cpufreq call tree. 
Into the lowest-level caller which is _above_ the function which the
hotplug code calls.
Like this:
	hotplug -> down() -> ... ->
	                            __cpufreq_driver_target()
	cpufreq -> down() -> ... -> 
and not like this:
	hotplug -> down() -> ... ->
	                            __cpufreq_driver_target() -> down()
	cpufreq -> ...           ->
