I really did mean all else being equal. eg. "clear_bit" vs "__clear_bit".

True, and many UP architectures have to implement atomic operations
with cli/sti pairs... so those are more reasons to use non-atomics.

Sure, I guess that would be possible. I've kind of toyed with doing
some cli/sti mitigation in the page allocator, but in that case I
found that it wasn't a win outside microbenchmarks: the cache
characteristics of the returned pages are just as important if not
more so than cli/sti costs (although that balance would change
depending on the CPU and workload I guess).
For slub yes you could do it with fewer downsides with process context
pools.
Is it possible instead for architectures where cli/sti is so expensive
to change their lowest level of irq handling to do this by setting and
clearing a soft flag somewhere? That's what I'd rather see, if possible.
