Subject: [PATCH 11/9] firewire: fw-sbp2: enforce a retry of __scsi_add_device if bus generation changed
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/6/284

fw-sbp2 is unable to reconnect while performing __scsi_add_device
because there is only a single workqueue thread context available for
both at the moment.  This should be fixed eventually.
Until then, take care that __scsi_add_device does not return success
even though the SCSI high-level driver probing failed (sd READ_CAPACITY
and friends) due to bus reset.  The trick to do so is to use a different
error indicator in the command completion as long as __scsi_add_device
did not return.
An actual failure of __scsi_add_device is easy to handle, but an
incomplete execution of __scsi_add_device with an sdev returned would
remain undetected and leave the SBP-2 target unusable.

Jarod, does this work like I assume and fixes your setup of two OXFW911
based disks?
