Sorry, I should've been more specific. I'm trying to compile the Linux kernel 
(2.4.5pre3) on a FreeBSD machine, which actually works quite well with this 
patch applied. This is the only place in the core that FreeBSD gets hung up 
on (init/main.c seems to include it unconditionally). Some drivers may still  
make incorrect assumptions about __linux__ being defined, though.
