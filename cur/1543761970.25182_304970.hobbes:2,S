I am trying to sync the linux-sound BK tree every week with our CVS.
For "urgent" fixes we need to find another faster way. Hopefully, they
are in most cases small enough, so they might be propagated automagically.
I already proposed special "tag" in our CVS commit policy, so we can 
identify these patches / changesets.
I will try to prepare some useable tool in few weeks.
