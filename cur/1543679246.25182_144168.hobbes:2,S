Hi,
With 2.5.73 the write protect on my SCSI MO drive (via Firewire IDE
enclosure) is not being detected properly. It always says the
write protect is off. The drive itself is properly being detected as
an Optical disk.
<snip>
SCSI device sdf: 605846 2048-byte hdwr sectors (1241 MB)
sdf: Write Protect is off
sdf: Mode Sense: 00 56 03 80
sdf: cache data unavailable
sdf: assuming drive cache: write through
 sdf: sdf1
Attached scsi removable disk sdf at scsi2, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
With 2.4 it works properly:
SCSI device sdf: 605846 2048-byte hdwr sectors (1241 MB)
sdf: Write Protect is on
 sdf: sdf1
Cheers,
Jurgen
