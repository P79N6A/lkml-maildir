If you really want that fun, try changing it to "unsigned long long"
on your private machine and do some testing.

Yep, looks sane.

You could possibly change the code to:
int vfs_readlink(struct dentry *dentry, char __user *buffer, int buflen, const char *link)
{
	union {
		unsigned len;
		int ret;
	} u;
	u.ret = PTR_ERR(link);
	if (IS_ERR(link))
		goto out;
	u.len = strlen(link);
	if (u.len > (unsigned) buflen)
		u.len = buflen;
	if (copy_to_user(buffer, link, u.len))
		u.ret = -EFAULT;
out:
	return u.ret;
}
But what would we gain, except for a few additional lines?
