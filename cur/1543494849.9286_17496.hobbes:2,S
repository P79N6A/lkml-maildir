Hello!
I have a problem getting the mouse/touchpad on my laptop to work with kernel
2.2.5/2.2.6! (not tried 2.2.7 yet) As noted, it's a PS/2 mouse. The mouse does
work normally using kernels from the 2.0.3x series.
As mouse devices I've tried /dev/psaux and /dev/inportbm, both with the same
result: The X server breaks off with a fatal error: "Can't open mouse (Operation
not supported by device)".
GPM doesn't work either but I didn't see any error messages from this one.
The device /dev/psaux has major/minor numbers 10/1 and /dev/inportbm has 10/2
which I believe to be correct. Both are marked as character special devices and
have read-write permissions for user,world,group and are owned by root (group
root).
Any suggestions, anyone?
