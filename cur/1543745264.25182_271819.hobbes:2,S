Think about putting the /sys/sysfs entry into the tree before sysfs has
been fully initialized :)
There are other fun races that Al Viro pointed out dealing with

Look through the 2.5 kernel series, it was in there for a while.
But don't really worry about it, just create /sys/fs/ and use it to put
your own stuff in it if you want.  Don't try to recreate the old, buggy
