This user did get the following messages in dmesg:
b43err(dev->wl, "Firmware file \"%s\" not found "
       "or load failed.\n", path);
b43err(wl, "You must go to "
       "
http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Drivers/b43#devicefirmware
 "
       "and download the correct firmware (version 4).\n");
I'm not sure how I can improve that even more. There is a full URL
describing how to get the device workin in _full_ detail.
Yes. I know people don't read messages and immediately report
a "regression". But that is not my fault. Not in this case.
It's not rocket science to get b43 working. The way firmware is
installed did not change at all. (b43-fwcutter is still used).
So it's the very same procedure that user X already successfully
did when installing bcm43xx.
What should I do to improve the situation? Writing the message
all in uppercase? Maybe. I can do a patch, if people finally start reading
it then.

Because it's closed source.

This is a proven false statement.

That's not what my problem is here.
The problem is that every now and then people come up and say that
b43 is crap and doesn't work for them while bcm43xx does. In _every_
single case it was the user's fault. Mostly not reading the kernel
message I quoted above.
So I'm not sure what I have to do now? Defer removal of an obsolete
and unstable piece of junk because some people don't read kernel
logs in case something doesn't work?
