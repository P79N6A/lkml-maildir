I happened to work towards that direction this morning (before I read your
mail). Taking the stance that this very probably had something to do with io
stress, I played around with several io loads. Eventually I found out that
fsx on scsi disk reliably caused the box to either lock up or the aic7xxx
driver to barf. What's more, it took under 15 minutes to trigger.
So I copied the rootfs and everything else from the scsi disk to the ide
disk (just barely had enough space), and took all the scsi disk partitions
away from fstab. After reboot, I have been unable to lock it up with fsx
(scsi disk is not accessed at all), but it will take several weeks before
I'm confident that the lock up is cured.
aic7xxx / scsi hw seems quite strong suspect for the lock ups. 2.2 possibly
worked because it has the older aic7xxx 5.x driver.

It is a sort-of-a production machine -- that's way I have been so wary on
trying different things. Sorry for that...

They dump the oracle data base to a backup file.
${ORAHOME}/bin/exp \
        ***/*** full=Y grants=Y \
        file=${DMPDIR}/fullexp.dmp 1>${LOGDIR}/fulllog.`date '+%a'` 2>&1
 
So basically just heavy IO afaict.

I'm still not 100% sure that the aic7xxx brafs (see
http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/7/29/33
 for an example) and the lockups are of
the same origin. But it seems at least 99.5% certain.
If aic7xxx/scsi is to blame, then is it the
  - 2940 scsi adapter
  - the disk
  - the cabling or something (I've checked the termination)
  - the motherboard (irq routing?)
  - the aic7xxx driver?
  - some other kernel issue?
The hw is:
 Intel 815EEA2LU (i815 Chipset)
 Celeron 1.3GHz (Tualatin)
 Adaptec AHA-2940 / AIC-7871
   - Disk (rootfs) SEAGATE  Model: ST19171W Rev: 0024
   - Tape Drive    HP       Model: C1537A Rev: L708
 30GB IDE disk (scratch)
