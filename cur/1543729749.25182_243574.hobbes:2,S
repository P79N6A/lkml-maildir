I think I am seeing those weird ~1 ms latencies still (actually I am not
sure I saw before now):
http://krustophenia.net/testresults.php?dataset=2.6.8.1-P4#/var/www/2.6.8.1-P4/kswapd_latency_trace.txt
This was the result of doing `make -j12' with a large C++ program (I
know, I wanted to see what would happen).  This gradually slowed the
machine to a crawl - for a while I could watch the /proc/latency_trace
fiels and see the latency gradually climbing.  Eventually tha machine
ground almost to a halt, with lots of disk activity., and trying to
switch from X to a console window resulted in a blank screen for 2-3
minutes.  I did eventually get a text console and was able to kill all
the cc1plus processes, and the machine went back to normal.
The link above is the highest latency recorded during this episode.
