Hi Alan,
The flue changed my weekend :-(. I do however have 2 general questions first:
> - Handles the temperature device
Why don't we treat the temperature part not as a hwmon?
> - It does all the reboot, nowayout and module locking and housekeeping
Why don't we use the shutdown methods of our platform and other devices instead of the reboot notifier setup?
Kind regards,
Wim.
