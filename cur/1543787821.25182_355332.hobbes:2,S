Hello!
Is it wanted, that some hardware raids are listed below
"Block devices" and not IDE or SCSI support?
And will SATA devices in general stay below SCSI?
Both things aren't really intuitive to find and I would expect
the raid drivers below IDE or SCSI and I was searching for SATA
not below SCSI some times.
