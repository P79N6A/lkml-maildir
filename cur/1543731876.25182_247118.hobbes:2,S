regarding this issue, i have done some exploration and found that
ipt_owner is capable of registering by pid.
therefore, the naive approach considered was to have fireflier
"vet" rules via its userspace rules dynamically creating per-pid
_new_ and _real_ rules (based on the template of options specified
from the corresponding userspace rule) but of course with the
ipt_owner "pid" set.
this would at first glance solve the "INCOMING" problem which i
understand the present ipt_owner code to be suffering from.
anyway - this approach is insufficient and fraught with
difficulties, not least involving purging the queue of existing
packets that _would_ match the newly created rule, but it's
too late, they're already in the queue.
etc.
so, what i would like to consider doing is to modify the ipt_owner
module to include the full pathname of the binary it is supposed to
vet.
i don't give a rat's monkeybutt about "oo, yuk, that's disgusting
to do that in the kernel" or "that would _so_ slow network traffic
down": i don't care: this is going in an selinux system where the
performance hit of selinux has already been accepted, so a couple
more percentage performance hit i really don't give a stuff.
so, my question, therefore, is:
	what should i record in a modified version of ipt_owner in
	order to "vet" packets on a per-executable basis?
	should i consider recording the inode of the program's binary?
	should i consider recording the _name_ of the program?
	if i record the inode number, what example code should i examine
	in order to DoTheRightThing of getting from process-pid to
	inode/program?
for example, i notice in ipt_owner.c that match_pid() calls
find_task_by_pid().   okkkaaay... so... and then in fs/proc/base.c's
proc_exe_link(), i see that get_task_mm() is called to get
something called an mm_struct.   and theeeennn... dget is called
on _that_, and _then_ in struct dentry, there's something called
a d_inode, and _that_ is what i presume contains the inode number
of the running process (i_ino).
am i along the right lines, or should i be (according to
proc_exe_link()) hunting down the struct vfsmount argument
with mntget() instead?  somehow i don't think so, but i haven't
any point of reference to know in advance.
anyone with experience in the workings of proc and things, your
input and advice greatly appreciated.
