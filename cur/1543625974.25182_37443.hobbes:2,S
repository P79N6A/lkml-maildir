For fsync-intensive loads ext3's best mode is generally
data=journal.  That way, an fsync is satisfied by a nice
single linear write to the journal.
With a high volume of data you'll quickly exhaust the
journal space so it would also be beneficial to create
a monster journal with, say, mke2fs -J 400.
