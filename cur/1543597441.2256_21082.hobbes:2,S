Maybe a XFree86 mail list would be a better address for your mail.
Anyway, you should go back ti XF 3.3.6, since your card is not supported
with XF 4.1.0, and you would get no
advanteges because your card does not support 3d acceleration, and 2d
acceleration with
XF86_S3 or even XF86_SVGA
of 3.3.6 version is quite optimal for your card.
