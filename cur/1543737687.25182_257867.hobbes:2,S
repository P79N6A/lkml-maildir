the dmesg info shows you had a crash early on, in khubd:
 Badness in remove_proc_entry at fs/proc/generic.c:688
  [<c018c8e8>] remove_proc_entry+0x152/0x15a
  [<f8b8e116>] uhci_hcd_init+0x116/0x133 [uhci_hcd]
  [<c0135f0e>] sys_init_module+0x1df/0x2da
  [<c01044ed>] sysenter_past_esp+0x52/0x71
 usb 3-1: new low speed USB device using address 2
 Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address a49c0e0c
i believe this is a crash present in -mm too. In theory such a crash
could mess up the kernel so best would be if you could try a kernel with
USB disabled? Hopefully none of your critical devices is on USB ...
