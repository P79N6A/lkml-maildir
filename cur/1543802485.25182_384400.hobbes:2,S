Thanks for your response.  I'm prob. being stupid here... but does 
"increase" here mean faster or slower?

If you've done other "standard" type of benchmarks between the two 
please post your results.  Also, is there a big hit by using a nearly 
pure 32-bit environment + the rare 64-bit program when needed?
