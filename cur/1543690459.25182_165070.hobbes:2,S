Hi, could you alter this so that it does not mess around with kernel 
threads? It should
only adjust user processes. Sorry if it is doing the right thing, but 
[eg] pdflush has a prio
of 100 currently..
In general usage (no load, X 4.3.0 + gnome 2.2.x), applications start up 
slower.
Under a moderate load (make -j4) xmms will not skip but it fails the 
wiggle test.
Renicing X to -10 (it was at 0 before) does not seem to help.
[Machine is an Athlon 1200 (not a rating) with 384mb ram, ide disks with 
DMA
 enabled]
Hope this helps, somehow :-)
