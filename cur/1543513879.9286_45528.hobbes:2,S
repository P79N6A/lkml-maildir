Into the same direction goes the following question: How would I
advise the system that I am going to scan the following
multi-megabyte file only once, and that the contents of this
file need not enter any disk cache, because that would be
useless? Imagine a numerical algorithm sequentially scanning a
very large file for transformation or a video player streaming
from disk or something like that.
