Here are the size results, for a start:
UP:
Before:
size vmlinux
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
3094881  243110  221184 3559175  364f07 vmlinux
After:
size vmlinux 
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
3093409  243142  221184 3557735  364967 vmlinux
SMP:
Before:
size vmlinux
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
3222269  318770  237568 3778607  39a82f vmlinux
After:
size vmlinux
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
3221421  314674  237568 3773663  3994df vmlinux
(The data size changes are moving from pda -> percpu, and on SMP
removing the page-aligned PDA).
So, a slight win.  lmbench tomorrow...
Rusty.
