So, after backing out  00_net-softirq (this was killing my networking
and NFS setup for some reason) and applying the new scheduler
related fix in xfs, I have had this kernel up a few hours running
dbench and a bunch of other things, it has not hung once or exhibited
any other problems.
Having said that, my environment is different, I do not have 4G of
memory, I have 128M, and I also do not have md - not enough disks
right now to do that.
