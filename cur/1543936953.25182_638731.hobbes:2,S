Ok, should something like this be added to the documentation?
It would be cool to be able to include few examples (modern SATA disks
support bariers so are safe, any IDE from 1989 is unsafe), but I do
not know enough about hw...

+Requirements
+============
+
+Ext3 needs disk that does not do write-back caching or disk that
+supports barriers and Linux configuration that can use them.
+
+* if disk damages the sector being written during powerfail, ext3
+  can't cope with that.  Fortunately, such disks got firmware updates
+  to fix this long time ago.
+
+* if disk writes random data during powerfail, ext3 should survive
+  that most of the time.
