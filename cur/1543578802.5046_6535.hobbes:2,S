Hi all,
  I need help with the following problem on my
Dual Pentium III 550Mhz with kernel 2.2.17 SMP
and RTL8139 as eth0 :
Sometimes the message
 eth0: RTL8139 Interrupt line blocked, status 1.
appears which doesn't seem to cause problems, but
yesterday the message
 eth0: SMP simultanous entry of an interrupt handler.
appeared just after it. From this moment the
network performance goes down to just a few bytes per
second until system restart.
Is this a known problem ?
Thanks for any hint.
Armin
