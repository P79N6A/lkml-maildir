Hi list,
I try to set up IDE-Support for ARM-Integrator with an PDC20268.
This controller is currently not supported in 
linux/drivers/ide/pdc202xx.c
It is possible to define this controller with the same behavior as 
PDC20267 in linux/drivers/ide/pdc202xx.c?
Because the ARM-Integrator is not compatible to i386 is it possible
to get problems with the PDC-BIOS?
Best regards
Frank
