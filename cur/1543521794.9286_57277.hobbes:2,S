OS/390 (IBM mainframe operating system) supports 'name/token
pairs'.  It supports different scopes, which on a Unix system might
map to names limited to a process or names accessable to all
processes on the system.  Associated with the name is a 16 byte
value.  It seems to me that a service like this would be the best
way to maintain access to persistant storage across module loads
(with a suitable naming convention).  Persistant storage would be
kmalloced, and a pointer to the area saved using a name/token
pair.
