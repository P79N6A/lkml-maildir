That is hitting a special case, a triple page fault.  The buggy RAM
caused a fault, the error handler took another fault, recovering from
that failed again - instant reboot from hardware.  In a lot of cases,
an Oops is recoverable.  The problem is that we cannot tell which ones
are restartable and which ones are not.
