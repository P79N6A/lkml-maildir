I think you didn't understand my request.
I have a *binary* kernel module that was compiled with 
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS enabled.
Thus, that binary module includes 32-bit (?) checksums for several 
kernel functions AND kernel structures.
cf. my original post:
$ hexdump -C test.ko | grep -A2 struct_
000752e0  17 98 07 0e 73 74 72 75  63 74 5f 6d 6f 64 75 6c 
|....struct_modul|
000752f0  65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 
|e...............|
00075300  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 
|................|
For example, the checksum for "struct_module" seems to be 0x1798070e.
Is there a tool (from linux-module-init-tools?) to list all the 
checksums included in a binary module.
Regards.
