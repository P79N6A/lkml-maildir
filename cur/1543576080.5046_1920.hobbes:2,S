The patch looks fine, and thanks for the commentary on why it was done
this way.
The other module problem (the fact that nfsd and nfs didn't resolve the
symbols in lockd, and couldn't be used as modules for that reason) seems
to be due to the "EXPORT_NO_SYMBOLS" in fs/lockd/svc.c. Thanks to Keith
Owens for debugging that one (which looks like a potential bug in "ld",
actually).
Can anybody else find build irregularities with the new Makefiles? Please
holler..
	Thanks,
		Linus
