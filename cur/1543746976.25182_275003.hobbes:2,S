The set-get is supposed to be used for queries, too? The size of value is
only used for the get case to describe the buffer length in that case?
because otherwise the set-get case may require a short value in and a large
answer structure out.
The syscall should also allow cunking in response, unless we remove all
high-volumne answers from it.
