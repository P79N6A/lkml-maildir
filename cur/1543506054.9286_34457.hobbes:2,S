Yes you must be right, every disk has a cache in itself.
It dosen't cause any problems when it happens to crash _not_ depeding on
power-failure, all metadata on disk-cache (which is in the disk) will be 
write to the disk.
A problem is a crash depeding on power-failure.
Some disks may keep the order, some may try to flush all disk-cache,
others may not do that might cause little corruption.
I think journalling filesystem like XFS has the same problem.
Writting order of "journal" and "metadata" on disk-cache to real-disk
might be changed in some situation, it would cause a filesystem corruption
which can't be detected at journalled recovery after a crash.
It seems to be not good idea to configure disk-cache as write-through-cache
that leads a poor performance.
Is there any cool solution?

Hirokazu Takahashi
