> 2.4.20-pre5: prevent sparc32's atomic_read() from possibly discarding

Ok, the only reasonable way to deal with the last reiserfs vs.
sparc32 compilation warning is apparently to strip the const from
the wait_buffer_until_released() prototype, as it doesn't make any
sense there. Marcelo please disregard the atomic_read() patch and
apply the following instead:
