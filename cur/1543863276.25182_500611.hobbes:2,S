In the signal handling path yes.
Not always in the case of select, though.  Check core_sys_select:
if (!ret) {
                ret = -ERESTARTNOHAND;
                if (signal_pending(current))
                        goto out;
                ret = 0;
        }
...
out:
        if (bits != stack_fds)
                kfree(bits);
out_nofds:
        return ret;
Its possible for core_sys_select to return ERESTARTNOHAND to sys_select, which
will in turn (as its currently written), return that value back to user space.

It doesn't break it, it fixes it.  select isn't meant to ever return
ERESTARTNOHAND to user space:
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/select.html
And ENORESTARTHAND isn't defined in the userspace errno.h, so this causes all
sorts of confusion for apps that don't expect it.
