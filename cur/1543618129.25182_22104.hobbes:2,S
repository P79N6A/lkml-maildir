NO, IT DOES NOT. why can't you preempt-ophiles get that through your heads? 
	eager scheduling is NOT optimal in general.  
for instance, suppose my disk can only read a sector at a time.
scheduling my sequentially-reading process to wake eagerly
is most definitly PESSIMAL.  laziness is a cardinal virtue!
this doesn't preclude heuristics to sometimes short-cut the laziness.
