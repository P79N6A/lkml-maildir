I agree for 2.4 kernels the solution Petr stated is the best. It is not
easy to properly implement soft scrollback. Sometime ago I worked on a new
scrollback implementation that was more in the upper console layers so
other systems could take advanatge of it. It is not a easy problem to
solve. In the next following weeks I should start working on this again.
