nfsd_vfs_read() path.
nfsd_vfs_read()
    splice_direct_to_actor()
        while(len) {
            do_splice_to()                     [update sd->pos]
                -> generic_file_splice_read()  [read from sd->pos]
            nfsd_direct_splice_actor()
                -> __splice_from_pipe()        [update sd->pos]
        }
do_splice_to() updates sd->pos for read, and pass updated sd to
__splice_from_pipe(), and __splice_from_pipe() updates sd->pos for
write. So, next do_splice_to() read from wrong position.
