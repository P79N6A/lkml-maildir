Oppss... even with your GIT tree it doesn't work :(
But this time I think I've found the problem:
--- fs/ext3/super.c ---
ext3_remount()
{
...
	unsigned long fcache_devnum = 0;
...
	if (!parse_options(data, sb, NULL, NULL, &fcache_devnum, &n_blocks_count, 1))
...
        if (fcache_devnum) {
                ext3_close_fcache(sb);
                ext3_open_fcache(sb, fcache_devnum);
        }
...
}
---------------------
If I understand correctly I have to pass the "fdev=..." option not only
when remounting "rw" but even when remounting "ro" before shutdown or
reboot.
Cannot the code figure out this himself al let "mount -o remount,ro"
work?
