The code forgot to initialise all of these.
It just so happens that the all-bits-zero pattern works correctly for all
current architectures, so the code should work OK.  But there is no reason
(I hope) why an architecture cannot implement atomic_t as
struct atomic_t {
	int counter;
	spinlock_t lock;
};
in which case the results of ATOMIC_INIT() may _not_ be all-zeroes, in
which case the code will deadlock.
So.  It works, but it's grubby.   Do you still wish to proceed?
