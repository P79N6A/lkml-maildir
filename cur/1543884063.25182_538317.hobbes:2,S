Whoops! You've got an unterminated if there, let me fix it up...

Since there's a mix of pre-, post- and infix, the structure of the
operators _depends on_ the operands.

I'm exactly opposite; the "uncorrected" line above is a typo because
there's no continuation item at the end of the line. I don't even see
the following lines because they are, by definition, not part of the
code I'm looking at. Leaving the operators at the end of the line I
easily see that it's a binary operator, and there's no second operand
so the next line must contain it, parse the next line as well.
Hm. I didn't realise this but the unspoken underlying factor for me is
the "one instruction per line" style. If you must break over multiple
lines, there must be a continuation item to indicate that. This is how
I detect missing semicolons.
