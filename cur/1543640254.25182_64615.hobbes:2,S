while your patch looks OK, it would be *really* interesting to find out
why the previous layout failed. Does the BIOS somehow corrupt the GDT? You
are using the stock SMP code otherwise, correct? And this part of the
patch:
 gdt_48:
-       .word   0x8000                          # gdt limit=2048,
-                                               #  256 GDT entries
-
+       .word   gdt_end - gdt - 1               # gdt limit
        .word   0, 0                            # gdt base (filled in later)
perhaps this bit alone makes the difference?
