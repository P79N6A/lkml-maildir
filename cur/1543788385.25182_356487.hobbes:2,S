Firstly, if that is the case, then you will have dentries for both the
covered and the covering copies of /mnt/foo. A simple test of
have_submounts() on the dentry will suffice to tell the filesystem.
whether or not it should open the file.
Secondly, Linux doesn't actually allow bind mounts on top of regular
files.
Either one of these two points suffices to resolve the "race".
