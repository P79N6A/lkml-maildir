One fundamentally stupid thing is exposing to userland events that
are none of its fscking business.  Link removal - sure.  Last link
removal - perhaps, but that's not obvious; in any case it should be
tied to notification of link removal.  But inode getting freed or
last dentry going away is none of the userland concern.  
IOW, let the notification of link removal check ->i_nlink and add
"that was the last one" event if it had hit zero.  Or, better yet,
pass i_mode and i_nlink in the event itself and let the recepient
do obvious checks.
