	Does anyone besides me plan on trying to buy Loki games before the 31st?  I 
stopped by Electronics Boutique at Circle at Centre & 8th (great place for 
Dreamcast stuff) and bought Myth 2 for Linux (8$!  Holy deals, Batman! 
And the box had a 20$ tag on it, so I'm assuming the two copies of Linux 
Soldier of Fortune they have with 15$ tags must be pretty great too).  I'd 
like to also get in on a group buying thing, since my fundage is rather 
limited at the moment.  Anyone else up for it?
