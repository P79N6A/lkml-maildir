Hi Horst,
	Thoughtful and respecful criticism?  I didn't think that was
allowed on linux-kernel any more? 8)

Well, "modprobe foo" will only give you the "new_foo" driver if (1) the
foo driver isn't found, and (2) the new driver author decides that
it's a valid replacement.
Whether (2) is ever justified, I'm happy leaving to the individual
author (I know, that makes me a wimp).
Consider another example: convenience aliases such as char-major-xxx.
Now, I'm not convinced they're a great idea anyway, but if people are
going to do this, I'd rather they did it in the kernel, rather than
some random userspace program.
I think the alias mechanism is valid, but you have a point about the
dangers, too.
Thoughts?
Rusty.
