yes, we prefer inlines for just about everything. We have reoccuring 
regressions due to macro side-effects, lack of type and argument 
checking - and the simplest maintenance policy is to just never 
introduce new macros. Macros also played an active role in creating our 
current include file dependencies spaghetti. So unless there are very, 
very strong reasons in favor of adding a macro, please always use 
inlines.
