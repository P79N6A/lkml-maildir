	Hello, Pankaj.
	Probably you are not starting your RAID. You can check it with 
cat /proc/mdstat. If not, well, you can mark the partitions forming the RAID 
with persistent superblock (fd partition type in fdisk)) for starting 
automatically the RAID on boot, or fill in the /etc/raidtab file with the 
values of your current RAID and start it manually (see raidtools2 package).
	Also you can read RAID-HOWTO for unvaluable information.
	Regards,
		Ender.
