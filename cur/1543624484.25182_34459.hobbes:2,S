Jens,
Please try again because that is not the real problem.
All you have shown is that we disagree on the method of page walking
between BLOCK v/s IOCTL.  This is very minor and I agreed that it is
reasonable to map the IOCTL buffer in to BH or BIO so this is a net zero
of negative point.
How about attempting to describe the differences between the atomic and
what is violated by who and where.  I will help you later if you get
stuck.
Regards,
Andre Hedrick
