My hard disk on my server is all the time readding and writing some files (I can see it with dstat). However I would like to know which files exactly are readden or written all the time. I know that each filesystem activity goes by the VFS (virtual filesystem).
Is it possible to see all current open files in the VFS?
For example with a command like:
$ cat /proc/fs/vfs/open_files
$ cat /proc/fs/vfs/reading_files
$ cat /proc/fs/vfs/writing_files
?
Is there a possibility? It should be on the VFS level to be independent of the used filesystem.
