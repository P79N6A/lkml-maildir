The logic is not quite right, but tt's definitely another story indeed.

Well, at least you acknowledge that I *also* made technical comments - you
bluntly ignored them so far.

Sorry if you understood it that way - I certainly didn't want to attack
you personally. What I was attacking is the technically (and in their
consequences morally) unsound decisions redhat did as the first of the
major gnu/linux distribs.
Taken on it's own, redhat never did anything which is not "politically
correct" or "was just a bug that has been fixed". However, that redhat
claims to maintain linux, gcc and other major projects (which is
absolutely untrue) is an open secret - just look at sources.redhat.com
where redhat openly announces _their_ projects (like source navigator,
binutils and gcc).

they were involved, but I have reason to doubt that they actually agreed.

This really is an affront on your side, twisting reality quite a bit - the
gcc releases certainly are backwards compatible (with regards to old gcc
features), and, mind you, who broke the ABI? the gcc people????
Sorry, the only ones who actually broke anything major were redhat, this
is a hard fact.
