Yep - Standard Cabletron BS$^&. Just recently was told by Cabletron that
there exists NO standard for forwarding IP directed broadcasts (IE:
192.168.1.255) so they could not be faulted for their integral router not
forwarding such broadcasts. And yes I am emphasizing integral Router. This
came up when trying to setup some Netware 5.0 pure IP networks where we
also found out that the Cabletron did not "do" multicasting. It would
silently discard multicast packets and when we tried broadcasting
...hehehehe. Their idea of standards is whatever they feel is right....
