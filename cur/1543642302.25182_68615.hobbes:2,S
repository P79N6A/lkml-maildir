But that's horrible. The floppy driver can take huge bio's no problem, and 
limiting bio sizes to track sizes would be a huge pain in the driver for 
no good reason. In fact, it would be pretty much impossible, since the 
tracks aren't even page-aligned.
So limiting bio's fundamentally _cannot_ do the right thing. While adding
two lines of code _can_.

Try it (not plain 2.5.33, but current BK where floppy actually works). It
works, but reading a single sector will pause until it has read several 
tracks. Even though the sector came back much earlier.
Also, you missed the error case argument. Right now we _cannot_ handle 
error cases for partial transfers AT ALL. The bio interface simply does 
not support it.  And there is no way you can fix that with the current 
interface. While the partial completion case allows for at least partial 
recovery.
Andrew, give it up. The current interface _sucks_.

And an application that only wanted one sector? To notice that the 
filesystem is of the wrong type, for example? 
Throughput is _secondary_ to many latency concerns. And you cannot fix the 
latency with full bio's (see the track issue).
