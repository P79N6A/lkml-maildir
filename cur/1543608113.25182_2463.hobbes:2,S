Note that there are several tools that check the uptime, not just the
"uptime" command.  For example "top" and "w" also display the uptime
value (reading /proc/uptime).  But yes, if people don't check on their
boxes in a year, then this method will lose full multiples of 1.3 years
between checks.  Probably not a big deal - we can assume such a system
is an "appliance" at that point, regardless of what kind of real system
it is.  If someone wants to ensure their uptime is correct, they can
always put "[ -r /proc/uptime ] && cat /proc/uptime > /dev/null" in their
cron.monthly directory.
Cheers, Andreas
