Well, unfortunately, neither of the patches you guys sent do what I was 
looking for ;-)  My goal with that code was to enable a specific certain 
behaviour, and because of the deadlock I have to make a few changes 
elsewhere for it to work properly.  The workaround patches are fine for 
now, but later today I'll make a 0.12 that fixes it the way I'm looking 
for.  (Hint: it's legal for a program to call SETTRIGGER to disable PCM 
output, then call the write() routine to fill the buffer, then call 
SETTRIGGER again to start output, otherwise known as pre buffering, and 
I want to support that without forcing the DAC to be started on 
update_lvi())
The real answer is multipart:
1) during i810_open go back to the old behaviour of setting 
dmabuf->trigger to PCM_ENABLE_INPUT and/or OUTPUT based on file mode.
2) make sure that i810_mmap clears dmabuf->trigger
3) make sure that in both i810_write and i810_read, we force the trigger 
setting when we can't output/input any data because count <= 0
4) in update_lvi make the check something like:
if (!dmabuf->enable && dmabuf->trigger) {
    ....
}
That should solve the problem, I just haven't written it up yet.
