No, I am not, because I wasn't told to do so. For meny years I always 
used vanilla sources from kernel.org for my /usr/include/... I wasn't 
told, that it is wrong and I still believe, that Linux kernel headers 
should be fixed by including these conflicting macros and functions into 
__KERNEL__ block instead. Or am I missing something?
