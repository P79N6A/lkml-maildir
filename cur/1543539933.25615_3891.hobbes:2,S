 Please mail me a dump of your MP-table and the rest of APIC bits.  You
should be able to get these from the kernel log using `dmesg -s 32768'
after a bootup.  Use the "noapic" kernel parameter, to avoid a crash and
be able to get the log. 
 I suspect your MP-table provides a bogus APIC ID for the I/O APIC and the
current ID available from the chip itself is unusable as it collides with
one of CPUs (the designer of your BIOS should be shot if that's true!).  I
may prepare a workaround but I need to be sure this is really the case.
