One of my users is seeing this message from the nm256_audio driver:
NM256: Sound playback pointer invalid!
along with screeching noise coming from the speaker.
Running redhat kernels 2.4.9-31custom and 2.4.18-19.7.x can show the 
same problem.
I did a google search and found a similar post about this problem last 
June, but no solution.  Any ideas?
Thank You,
