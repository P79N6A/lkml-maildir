Good - it sounds like we're at least getting somewhere.

That's easy enough I should think (he says, never having run 99).  My question now is,
if we should uncover something that appears to be a problem in the kernel, will people
listen if the testcase that found it was SPECweb99, or will we wind up down the same
rathole we've been down recently?  I'm hoping we can find something that people won't
say "eww - a benchmark, how stupid", point out its flaws, and then ignore whatever
merit it may have.  In other words, I don't want to waste everyone's time.
