That's unusually long but if you look at the last reset try.  It began
at @48 and the device comes up after 32secs without the driver taking
further action, which might indicate that the device actually took that
long.  Hmmm.. maybe it's having problem establishing link at 3Gbps.

I see.  Does the attached patch make any difference?

That doesn't really mean much to native SATA devices.  That's just
something we're carrying over from PATA days.
Thanks.
