Doctor, it still hurts :-(
On ia64, we have two kernel stacks, one for outgoing task, and one for
incoming task.  for outgoing task, we haven't called switch_to() yet.
So the switch stack structure for 'current' will be allocated immediately
below current 'sp' pointer. For the incoming task, it was fully ctx'ed out
previously, so switch stack structure is immediate above kernel_stack(next).
It Would be beneficial to prefetch both stacks.
