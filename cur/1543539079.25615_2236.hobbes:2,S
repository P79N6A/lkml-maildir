You should probably upgrade your version of modutils, as this isn't needed
in the latest versions.

Every distribution does its startup a bit differently, and not many of
them yet ship with support for USB.
And this should be answered by the Linux USB HOWTO and FAQs which are
available at 
http://www.linux-usb.org/
If you have any other Linux USB specific questions, I suggest that you
send them to the linux usb mailing lists, which are described at that same
web page.
