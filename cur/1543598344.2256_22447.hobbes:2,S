    1. quite impossible due to the fact of exceedingly
high rate at which this trace is running:
  30 rows/second approx, and the impossibility to
  switch consoles/use gpm for cut/paste...
    2. i will, but results - tomorrow (GMT+3), since i`ll leave
  2.4.9 compilation to night (i tried twice, but failed
  because of infamous compile errors of ntfs and irda).
