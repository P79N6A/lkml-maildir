I could have sworn I checked for that and found a down_read(), but
now that I look when I have some time, it is clearly a down_write().
Sorry for the distraction.
It is a user job that is passing data between hosts.  The host is
under heavy memory pressure and one rank of the MPI job gets silent
data corruption.
Thanks and sorry for wasting your time,
Robin
