btw., if we decide that nonlinear isnt worth the continuing maintainance 
pain, we could internally implement/emulate sys_remap_file_pages() via a 
call to mremap() and essentially deprecate it, without breaking the ABI 
- and remove all the nonlinear code. (This would split fremap areas into 
separate vmas)
