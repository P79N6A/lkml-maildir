I'm glad to learn you are testing things. Still the oops in saa7110 went
unnoticed for the past 3 months, so I guess that either you don't have
a DC10(+) in your test panel, or you did not test mm/rc kernels.
I've gone through the code again, and here is what I think is broken in
2.6.11 on the various Zoran-based boards. Then everyone will be free to
pick any patch chunk he/she wants and apply it to any tree he/she likes.
BUZ:
Input (saa7111): works
Output (saa7185): no init, cannot set norm
DC10:
Input (saa7110): oops
Output (adv7175): no init, cannot set norm
DC30:
Input (vpx3220): works
Output (adv7175): no init, cannot set norm
LM33:
Input (bt819): no init
Output (bt856): works
LM33R10:
Input (saa7114): no init, cannot set norm
Output (adv7170): no init, cannot set norm
As you can see, all boards are affected at some level but every user
might not be equally affected, depends whether you use input or output
or both. Note that "no init" might not affect everyone either, depends
on the chip init defaults and the user needs. Ronald, can you tell us
what exactly in the above you are testing?
Personally I have only been able to test input on a DC10+ board (saa7110
driver). I lack hardware to test the output.
Hope that clarifies things,
