As far as the dcache goes, I'll stick to observing and reporting.
I'll rerun with dcache patches applied, though.

The context switch rate was 60 or 70 cs/sec. during the steady
state of the test, and around 10K cs/sec for ramp-up and ramp-down.
I've already prepared a kernel with a lowered HZ, but stopped briefly to
debug a calibrate_delay() oops and chat with folks around the workplace.
Thanks,
