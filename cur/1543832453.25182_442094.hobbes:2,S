Yes, I noticed that the floppy drivers has no dependency set but fails 
to build if GENERIC_ISA_DMA is not set.

These all have to use GFP_DMA and/or GFP_DMA. So if I leave that flag 
undefined then it will be obvious if something is amiss and we can leave 
this experimental for awhile.

Its safe in the sense that compilation/linking will fail (ISA dma chip 
control functions are not present). Some of the dependencies set right now 
do not correctly express these dependencies. But this could be fixed.
The question is though: Is it worth to do now? Or do we do this later? At 
some point the legacy DMA I/O will become too much of a bother.
