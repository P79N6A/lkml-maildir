Hi Guys,
What Riley said.  I do deserve a brown paper bag for not announcing that
I would be absent for several months though.
I've been stockpiling my e-mail, and my paychecks have started clearing,
and I've bought a Sony Vaio laptop.  So I'll be getting up to speed real
soon now (I'm going to Tokyo for two weeks this Saturday, argh).
Michael
