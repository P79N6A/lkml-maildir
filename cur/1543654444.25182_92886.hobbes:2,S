For those that don't remember, $FILENAME is in /mnt/backup and
it was 100% repeatable (ie. a data corruption bug). Alan,
unfortunately I can't do a lot of testing with the box now. I
might be able to give it a try when 2.4.20 comes out, or someone
else might be able to. Directory was only a meg or two IIRC
so it shouldn't be much hasstle for someone with a spare ext3
partition.
