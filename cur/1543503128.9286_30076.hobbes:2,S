You send a signal back and do a sigwaitinfo() waiting for it. The signal
can carry a status code.

It still eats a function call and a switch. What I mean is to replace
pthread_mutex_lock with a inline that does:
	;; ecx: mutex
	movl $0,%eax ; source
	movl $1,%ebx ; dest
	;; selfmarker (near free if it shares the  cache line with spinlock)
	movl %esp, owners_stack(%ecx)     
	cmpxchgl %ebx, spinlock(%ecx) 
	bz ok
	pushl %ecx ;; could even use regparm and safe this instruction
	call __pthread_mutex_lock 
ok: 	
self checks for errorcheck and recursive lock would require a range check
of the stack range now. the advantage is that is the lock is very cheap for 
the uncongested case. 
for the i386 case it is slower because it has to trap to the kernel, but
there is no other way [compiling for the specific cpu may be feasible for
system programs, but is not ok for the average application]. 386ers have
enough problems with threads that some small slow down [which they're 
probably used to anyways because of  the fp emulation..] doesn't harm too
much.
