i.e. this can be avoided when switching to threads in the same process.
How does a page table switch work?  As I understand there are PTE chains
which are pretty much linked lists the MMU follows; I can't imagine this
being a harder problem than replacing the head.  I'd imagine the head
PTE would be something like a no-access page that's not really mapped to
anything so exchanging it is pretty much exchanging its "next" pointer?
