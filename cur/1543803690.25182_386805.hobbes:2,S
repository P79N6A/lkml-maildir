While there is more work to be done on the AP side, and that code may
even be easily wrapped in an #ifdef, the majority of the complexity is
shared by both the station and the AP.  It's worth mentioning that the
802.11 specs do not generally differentiate between "APs vs non-APs" --
they're all "STAs" of equal capabilities.
This is at least true of 802.11d, 802.11e, 802.11i
(supplicant/authenticator notwithstanding), 802.11j, and 802.11k.  The
general difference is that the AP needs to be aware of the state of its
associated STAs, and perform different actions depending on configured
policy and the STAs' states, whereas the STAs generally do what the AP
tells them to do.

I agree that there would be some space savings, but they'd be relatively
small, at least if the stack is designed to be generic.  This would make
the most difference for tiny/embedded systems -- but they'd want to use
#ifdefs to disable all AP code entirely, which includes all of the "if 
(ap_mode) { } else { }" clauses that would litter the whole codebase, 
regardless of modularity.  (then if we use function pointers... that's a 
*lot* of virtual functions..)
