The Process Attribute API, Ext2 xattr handler, and Ext3 xattr handler look
clean, so I have no objections, either. It remains to be seen how useful
this API will be.
It will be necessary to document which security attributes are defined,
and which are their valid values. These things will eventually have to be
incorporated into e2fsck, so that after a file system check it is
guaranteed that the file system is in a consistent state.
Cheers,
Andreas.
