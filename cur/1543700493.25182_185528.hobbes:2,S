Please don't.  David Hinds has a better fix for this, which changes
the way we handle the allocation of IRQs.  David's change is all
round a far better way to handle the problem - if all ISA interrupts
are used or unavailable, we fall back to using the PCI interrupt
instead.
Please also note that there /is/ a PCMCIA list which patches should
be forwarded to - linux-pcmcia which is at lists.infradead.org
