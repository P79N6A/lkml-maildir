Subject: right way to export VM data to userspace for a performance tool

Hi everybody,
I want to write a tool that can extract information from the kernel about
the VM situation. Conceptually, I want something that looks like this:
# cacheinfo /var/mysql/data/powerdns/records.MYD
75% of blocks in memory
12% dirty
# cacheinfo -d -v /var/mysql/data/powerdns/records.MYD
0	M
1	M
2	-
3	-
4	D
....
Before writing this, I'm wondering how the kernel people feel that this sort
of information should be exported to userland. There are lots of options,
but not being a kernel architect/philosopher, I don't have a clue.
My goal is to have a patch included in the main kernel, so it is very
important that I write stuff people will agree on.
Please let me know what you think.
Kind regards,
bert
