Dave, it seems to me that this must be an example of a race between the 
iaa watchdog timer expiring and end_unlink_async() running.  It's not 
good enough for end_unlink_async() to call iaa_watchdog_done(), because 
on an SMP system the timer may already have fired and the watchdog 
routine may be spinning on ehci->lock.
It's even worse, because end_unlink_async() can call 
start_unlink_async().  If that happens, the watchdog routine will think 
the timer has expired when in fact it has just been restarted.
How about replacing the
	WARN_ON(!ehci->reclaim);
line in ehci_iaa_watchdog() with
	if (unlikely(!ehci->reclaim || 
			!HC_IS_RUNNING(ehci_to_hcd(ehci)->state) ||
			timer_pending(&ehci->iaa_watchdog))
		goto done;
where "done:" is added just before the spin_unlock_irqrestore?
