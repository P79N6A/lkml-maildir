Yeah, I know all that.

OK, so it was another global change.

Yeah, I know. Fear not: I'll be adding proper locks (spinlocks and
semaphores) to the code, continuing the work I started this weekend. I
don't like the BKL anyway (too coarse grained), and hope to see it
removed entirely one day.
Question: assuming data fed to vfs_follow_link() is "safe", does it
need the BKL? I can see that vfs_readlink() obviously doesn't need
it. From reading Documentation/filesystems/Locking I suspect it
doesn't need the BKL, but the way I read it says "follow_link() method
does not *have* the BKL already". But that doesn't explicitely say
whether vfs_follow_link() needs it.
