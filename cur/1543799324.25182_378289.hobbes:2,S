Yes! I use this (via symlinks) already and love it.
If I now could get age based file removal, to free up more
temporary space for sth. else with limits on minimum age,
I would be a very happy user.
I know this could be done in user space similiar to
the dynamic swap space addition.
So just take this as a hint from a customer :-)
