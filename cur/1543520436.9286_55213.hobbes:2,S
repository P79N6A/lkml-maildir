Subject: keep-alive doesn't seem to work on 2.3.13

The default keep-alive time is a long time to wait.
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time
10800
Therefore I set it to 60. I suppose this means 60 seconds.
I do:
 int on = 1;
 setsockopt(s, SOL_SOCKET, SO_KEEPALIVE, &on, sizeof(on));
It returns no errors, so this should mean that it's been accepted.
I do this with both an echo-sender and an echo-receiver, not the
default null-sink, because who knows what it's configured for.
	The client does:
	write(s, buf, len);
	The server does:
	read(s, buf, sizeof(buf));
Everything runs fine, 8.5 megabytes/second on a dedicated 100Mb line.
If I disconenct the wire, I would expect that either the server or
the client would give up and return an error code within some
reasonable period of time. This is not true. Neither the client nor
the server will give up even after 4 days.
My Sun, although not obviously configurable, gives up after 2 minutes.
Question:
How do I make keepalive work?
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
