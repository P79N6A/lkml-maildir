You are correct.  LTP isn't trying to be any kind of "compliance" test.
We're just trying to exercise and stress the Linux kernel to find bugs
and guard against regressions.

I don't think LTP's "framework[1]" is going to help Geoff complete his
project.  Geoff already created a SourceForge site.  As part of the
LTP, I probably would have given him a separate CVS module and a mailing
list.  I think he has everything he needs to get started already.  
That being said, if Geoff does want his Open POSIX test suite to be part
of the LTP, we'll gladly accomodate him.  
[1] By framework I think you mean logistical, not libraries.  I think
our test libraries have some things he might like.  I just recommend
cleaning them up before using them.
