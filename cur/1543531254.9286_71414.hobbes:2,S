I have gone through a bunch of the old archives, and found that several
times, in several places, the issue of large (>2 gig) files has come up.
However, this still seems to be an issue.  I have worked a little with the
LFS patches, and had minor success.  Does anyone know/have a filesystem
that will support these larger files? (Oh, this is in an Intel platform...
PPro)  
I am working on a video server project, but in most cases, the files are
larger than 2 gigs...  Any help would be appreciated!
