In fact, as videodev.h were included, all V4L1 stuff were also added.
Now, if you try to compile it with V4L1, it will fail. Bttv have support
for both V4L1 and V4L2 inside, but still relies on several V4L1 stuff at
the code Nickolay did a patch in the past to remove V4L1, using,
instead, v4l1_compat mode. At that time, it suffered some troubles, and
his patch became obsoleted by several changes (basically at msp3400). We
should get his patch again, port to current version and fix.

On your hg, there are 4 patches to be applied:
1) Fix bug where struct video_device was not defined consistently
This one seems to conflict with some previous changes I did. Please
remove it from your tree (you need to re-clone it - you may use hg-menu
to help on this stuff);
2) Remove of couple of useless lines
Seems ok.
3) Handle class_device_create_file in V4L2 drivers
The patch didn't applied well at current tree.
4) bttv: clean up some pre-2.6.0 class device compat stuff
the removal of class_device_create_file on compat.h won't break
compilation against kernel versions 2.4? Yes, I know that current
building system won't allow such compilations, but I don't want to
remove compat stuff for 2.4. Maybe someone may work later on make V4L to
work well on 2.4. This would be interesting to embedded systems.
Please re-do your tree and ask me to pull after done.
