This is helpful to narrow down the problem, but its a bit of a layering 
violation.  In the current code, all functions called by 
ata_device_{suspend,resume}() are high level functions, which uses 
ata_qc_issue/ata_qc_complete high level API to address the device.
In contrast, ata_busy_sleep() sticks its hands deep into the host state 
machine, and gives the tree a good hard shake.  :)  Consider that 
ata_busy_sleep() doesn't make sense for unusual cases like 
ATA-over-ethernet (AoE), or other tunnelled ATA transports.
It may very well be that ata_busy_sleep() is the proper solution for 
your hardware, but it isn't applicable to all hardware.
So you really want an ata_make_sure_bus_is_awake_and_working() called at 
that location.  ata_busy_sleep()'s purpose is to bring a PATA-like bus 
to the bus-idle state.  So, when working on suspend/resume, the software 
needs to have points at which the bus state is controlled/queried/asserted.
