These words carry little weight as they are hearsay.  You say that
somebody told you something, but you don't who and you don't say
precisely what, and on that basis you claim a conclusion.  What you
surely mean is that it's your opinion that I'm wrong, based on your
interpretation of recommendations by lawyers.  And since when did a
lawyer ever give their opinion unequivocally?  In my experience they
always mince their words, providing no bankable guarantee.
