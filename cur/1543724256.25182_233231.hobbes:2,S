That's about it, the most important issue is that I want to avoid
having an inconsistent file on the disk for long periods, because a)
the application could crash and b) another process might want to map
the same file (read-only). And since the application is reaching points
where the data is consistent, while it is not in between, it would be nice
to have a private mapping while it is inconsistent and commit the changes
only at the points where the application knows the data is consistent.
Turning a private into a shared mapping would be a perfect solution
since that would mean another process could map the file at any time
and find consistent data. The second best solution would be the
one where the application just manually writes out the changed pages
at the time of consistence, this would at least reduce the times when the
data on disk is inconsistent to a minimum.

A little different: Think of N processes (N may be 8 or so) that mmap()
a file using a new mode "MAP_SNAPSHOT" (which could be read-only if a mix
with private copy-on-write pages was too hard to realize), and 1 process
mmap()ing the same file using MAP_SHARED. Once the N processes mmap()ed
the file using MAP_SNAPSHOT, their "view" of the file content would never
change, that is, if the one process that mmap()ed the file with MAP_SHARED
writes to a page, that page _is_ written to disk the usual way, but the
other N processes get a copy of the page before it has been changed, so
they will always see the same data.
Once the processes that mmap()ed using MAP_SNAPSHOT unmap the file, the
copies of the pages that were changed on disk are simply discarded.
That would - similar to the features mentioned above - allow one process
to efficiently work on portions of a huge file over a longer period of time,
and only at times when the file in total contains consistent data, other
processes could be instructed to mmap() them again to obtain a newer version.
