Ah, ok.  What I'm thinking of is something like the following (untested
and probably improperly thought out patch...):

An architecture could then define KCORE_BASE and in_vmlist_region()
alongside their VMALLOC_START definition if they needed to change
them.

Well, only root can debug using /proc/kcore, and I'd suggest the best
answer to that problem is "if it hurts, don't do that."  I don't think
you should prevent modules from being unloaded just because you have
/proc/kcore open.
