I have successfully used transconnect
(
http://sourceforge.net/projects/transconnect
) for tunnelling git
protocol through a HTTP proxy (squid in my case) supporting the CONNECT
method.
Git also supports the GIT_PROXY_COMMAND environment variable (or
core.gitproxy config option), through which you can specify a program to
be run instead of connecting to a TCP port - then you can use netcat for
connecting through proxy; however, I have not tried this.
Note: most HTTP proxy servers allow CONNECT method to a very limited
range of ports, and administrators will need to enable the git port
(9418) explicitly.
