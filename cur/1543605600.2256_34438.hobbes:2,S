You aren't crazy, it doesn't build here either.  The problem is that
fixmap.h only includes those defines if CONFIG_IO_APIC is defined. 
Well, I don't have use IO_APIC (I am UP) but I do define
CONFIG_X86_APIC.  So it does not compile.
So, the problem is that acpitable.c assumes you have both CONFIG_IO_APIC
and CONFIG_X86_APIC declared.  It shouldn't.  Even more important, why
is my system compiling acpitable.c now?  I don't compile anything to do
with ACPI.  What needs access to the ACPI tables via Mini-ACPI, now?
