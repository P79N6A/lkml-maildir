Two important trends in data center technology are server
consolidation and storage consolidation. A.o. every web hosting
company can profit from a fast storage solution. I wouldn't call this
a small user base.
Regarding iSER and SRP on IB: InfiniBand is today the most economic
solution for a fast storage network. I do not know which technology
will be the most popular for storage consolidation within a few years
-- this can be SRP, iSER, IPoIB + SDP, FCoE (Fibre Channel over
Ethernet) or maybe yet another technology. No matter which technology
becomes the most popular for storage applications, there will be a
need for high-performance storage software.
