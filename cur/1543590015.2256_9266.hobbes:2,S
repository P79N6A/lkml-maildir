Okay, I think I now feel comfortable enough that I think I can unleash
this on the world...
I have made an extension to iso9660/RockRidge to allow for transparent
uncompression of block-compressed files.  Because the files are
block-compressed, random access is fast; it uses a 32K blocksize which
gets pretty good compression ratios (I got 2:1 overall compression on
my SuperRescue CD; that includes a fair number of incompressible
files.)
The patches are available as:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hpa/filemap-2.4.4-1.diff.gz
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hpa/zisofs-2.4.5-pre1-5.diff.gz
(Both are needed.)
Additionally, the user-space utilities (a program to compress and
uncompress file trees, and a patch to mkisofs to generate the new
RockRidge records for compressed files) are available at:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hpa/zisofs/
If you test this out, please let me know; I'd like to know if anyone
actually cares about this... also, I would like to gauge if I have
messed up stability anywhere.
