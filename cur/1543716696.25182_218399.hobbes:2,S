The structure is only used for the management software. This is only 
used, because there is no sg_io() function for char devices like it is 
for block devices.

That's true, i'll fix this.

AFAIK the msg[2] and msg[3] is not used by the I2O controller itself. It 
is only used by the driver to track messages (when a reply message comes 
back). So it should be save to not use the cpu_to_le32() here.

Okay, i'll try fix this too.
Thank you very much that you take time to review my patch.
