he's doing that for quite some time now (for suse's kernels too) and
that works pretty well :-)

the trouble with that is also that the whole patch must be checked again
and again if a new version is being sent out. Andrea's patches have th
epossibility to be applied for several versions and indeed are easy to
use -- apply what you want.
it made SMP testing more fun compared to the big patches where nobody
exactly knows what patch may have caused [in]stability.
I for instance have the daunting task to check why 2.4.0 here crashes so
easily without messages, except some occasional APIC error. yuck.
