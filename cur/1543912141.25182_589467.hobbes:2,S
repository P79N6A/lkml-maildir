I think I found the problem. As I suspected, it seems there is an assymetry
between the 1st end 2nd counter (just like what they have on P6 core). Yet
for architectural perfmon v1, this restriction is supposed to be lifted.
Unfortunately, a quick look at the errata document at
http://download.intel.com/design/mobile/SPECUPDT/30922212.pdf
for Core Duo shows bugs A49 as 'nofix':
  Core Duo processor has a bug which renders the enable bit (22) of
  PERFEVTSEL1 inoperative. The processor behaves like former P6 cores,
  the enable bit of PERFEVTSEL0 controls the activation of both counters
That explains why you get the 'NMI stuck' message when using PERFEVTSEL1.
I suspect when using PERFEVTSEL0, then NMI watchdog is not stuck. So it
is possible that in case NMI is stuck the code does not cleanly shutdown the
NMI interrupt and you get some spurious NMI interrupt later in the boot at
you are stuck because you are holding a lock. We need to look at the error
path of check_nmi_watchdog(). I glance through it and could not find the place
where the APIC vector is cleared.
