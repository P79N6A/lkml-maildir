You can only have one zone of each type under each pg_data_t.  For
instance, you can't properly represent (DMA, NORMAL, HIGHMEM, <GAP>,
HIGHMEM) in a single pg_data_t without wasting node_mem_map[] space.
The "proper" discontig way of representing that is like this:
        pg_data_t[0] (DMA, NORMAL, HIGHMEM)
        <GAP>
        pg_data_t[1] (---, ------, HIGHMEM)
Where pg_data_t[1] has empty DMA and NORMAL zones.  Also, remember that
both of these could theoretically be on the same NUMA node.  But, I
don't think we ever do that in practice.

I don't blame you :)

That refers to the NUMA node that you're thinking of.  Close CPUs and
memory and I/O, etc...

Yes, those are all NUMA nodes.

I believe there are quite a few assumptions on some architectures that,
when NUMA is on, they are equivalent.  It appears to be pretty much
assumed everywhere that CONFIG_NUMA=y means one pg_data_t per NUMA node.
Remember, as you saw, you can't assume that MAX_NUMNODES=1 when NUMA=n
because of the DISCONTIG=y case.
So, in summary, if you want to do it right: use the
CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES that you see in -mm.  As plain DISCONTIG=y
gets replaced by sparsemem any code using this is likely to stay
working.
