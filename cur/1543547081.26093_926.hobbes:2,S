The kernel is a multi-million-lines-of-code piece of software.
Software maintenance cost is found to correlate strongly with the
number of lines-of-code.
So, I would prefer the shorter version. 
If it takes you a few seconds to look this over, that's fine. Even it
the one "complicated" line take twice as long (per line) as the
original 4 lines, then it's a win. 
And when you take 10 times longer grokking that one line, you need to
do that just once. This construct is used all over the code. You
should learn to recognize it.
If you see:
	for (i=0;i<10;i++)
you immediately recognize a loop that iterates 10 times. Not 9, not
11. You don't go figuring out and counting things with the starting
and ending iteration.
With a little practise, the same will happen with the 
	return ..?-efault : 0;
