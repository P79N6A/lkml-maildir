Adding a hard drive adds $low per system, another failure point, and
more importantly ~3-10 Watts which then has to be paid for twice (once
to power it, again to cool it). For a hundred seats, that's
significant. For 500, it's ranging toward fully painful.
I'm in the process of designing the next upgrade for a VoIP call
center, and we want to go entirely diskless in the agent systems. We'd
also rather not swap over the network, but 'swap is as swap does.'
That said, it in no way invalidates using /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes...
