I have gotten as far as rc2-mm2, which was a fairly complete failure.  After
just a couple of pings on the interface, the whole system started to freeze
up fairly hard.  Please see   
http://www.hetzel.org/8169/rc2-mm2/
   for a
set of information on the system state this time around.  The last two
lines in messages.txt are:
illyria kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
illyria kernel: eth0: interrupt 0001 taken in poll
Then things go south pretty hard and fast...
I'll try the other patches on top of rc2-mm2 tonight and see if that turns
out any better :)
