With the proposed changes it's nearly trivial to build the traditional
MAINTAINERS file with a Makefile rule, so you've lost nothing. Plus
you get the additional info (which the collecting script, two lines of
sed in my estimate, would duly include[1]) which _file_ actually is
maintained by whom.
Which makes e.g. coordinating patches and bug reporting much easier.

querying tool at this point :-)
