Perhaps we can use radix-trees here.  Frankly, I haven't investigated this
possibility yet, because this part is not very high on my priority list for
improvements. :-)
First, I'd like to get the userland suspend out so people can benefit from the
userland interface.  Second, I think we can save much more memory if we
use bitmaps for the image metadata, but that will require a lot of work.
Then, there's the problem of the system responsiveness after resume,
and the "USB storage not available after resume" problem that I wouldn't
like to drop on the floor.  Not to mention device driver problems.
Greetings,
Rafael
