I think this warning is likely bogus:
        /* Move it here so it can run. */
        kthread_bind(p, smp_processor_id());
That just makes sure that the thread can get cleaned up somewhere on
some active cpu.  The only problem would be if the cpu that the thread
was bound to also went down.  But, I think that's prevented by the big
cpu hotplug semaphore.  (the "down"ing CPU can't be "down"ed in the
process of "down"ing :)

This doesn't do much more than suppress the warning.  If there was some
kind race there before, then it's still there but is now hidden.
