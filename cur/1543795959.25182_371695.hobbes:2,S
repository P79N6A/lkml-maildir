It's perfectly acceptable in 2.6, assuming it's properly divided up  
into small discrete changes and spends a bit of time in -mm first to  
work out the bugs.  If people want to maintain out-of-tree drivers,  
especially those using assembly, when things break they get to keep  
both pieces.  This patch produces a rather large space savings and  
speeds things up to boot, and I would support it being pushed to  
Linus during the 2.6.16 merge window assuming it stands up to abuse  
in -mm for a bit.
Cheers,
