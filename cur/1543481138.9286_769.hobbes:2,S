How about I do it for him?
Read what the vender has define as the CHS values on the drive.
Ask for help to do a LBA translation, only because you can not abandon
the MicroSoft security blanket.
If you can drop the need for that silly, then you only need to pass the
drive size values once (well until you have the first succesful setup).
That drive is hdx=19985,16,63 or hdx=1247,255,63
Should this new drive become you booting drive and you have a CHS
value/setup identical to the vender's specs., you will need to have
linear added to you /etc/lilo.conf.
I hope this answer will help.
Andries point was we don't wnat to have anything of linux screwed over by
an overlay mess.
