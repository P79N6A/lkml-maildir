Already be done fairly well. If you find one that isn't yet done then its
a bug. Also has issecure(SECURE_NOROOT) and
issecure(SECURE_NO_SETUID_FIXUP) .

There is support is fs/exec.c(prepare_binprm and compute_creds)  for what
happens when you exec. there is also cap_emulate_setxuid in kernel/sys.c
that controls what happens when you setreuid and family.

Yes and its being done. Could you check some of the changes in
prepare_binprm etc and see if they are to your liking?
