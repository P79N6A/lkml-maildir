I added more debug in __journal_refile_buffer() to see if the marked
buffers are getting refiled. I am able to reproduce the problem,
but I don't see any debug including my original prints. (It looks as 
if none of my debug code exists) - its really confusing. 
I will keep looking and get back to you.
I may try Andrew's buffer debug patch - if I get desperate.
Thanks,
Badari
