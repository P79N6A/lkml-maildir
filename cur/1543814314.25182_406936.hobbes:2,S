But that's a cache coherency issue that is really orthogonal to the memory
consistency one. WHY, when explaining memory consistency, do they need to
know that a barrier "usually stops at cache" (except for alpha)?
They already _know_ that barriers may have no visibility on any other CPU
because you should tell them that barriers only imply an ordering over the
horizon, nothing more (ie. they need not imply a "push").

Well maybe ;) But for better or worse, it is what kernel programmers now 
have to
deal with.

Why? I'm contending that this is exactly what they don't need to know.

What do you mean "extend"? I don't think that is good terminology. What 
it does is
provide an ordering of traffic going over the vertical line dividing CPU 
and memory.
It does not matter whether "memory" is actually "cache + coherency" or 
not, just
that the vertical line is the horizon between "visible to other CPUs" 
and "not".
