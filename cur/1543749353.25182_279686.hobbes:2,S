Maybe I should also say that this doesn't fix any bugs.  It simply makes
the headers easier to work with.  I've been doing a lot of work in those
headers for the memory hotplug effort, and I think that this is a
worthwhile cleanup effort.  Plus, it will make my memory hotplug patches
look a little less crazy :)
