The suspending and the resuming kernel need to touch metadata.
The kernel writing the image does not need to touch it.
You need to make sure that the metadata on disk is in a state that
allows the resuming kernel to find the file.

You'd need to pass just a bitmap of the swap space. Or you go the
easiest way and use a dedicated partition.

Why would you need to support swap files?
