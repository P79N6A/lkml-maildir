OK, perhaps you are right. I received a credible report from
Ed Tomlinson that the "reading the last block" bug is in 2.4.10.
It seems that either I fixed something else with the same symptoms
or I fixed it improperly. Unfortunately, I cannot reproduce it.
By the way, why does everyone insist on using ide-tape?
It seems to be broken beyond any repair by injection of
lethal poison marked "OnStream Support" (not that it was brilliant
before, but that was the last nail in the coffin). Just use ide-scsi
and be done with it. I really do not enjoy reading ide-tape.c.
