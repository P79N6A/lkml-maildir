What you actually need to do for wd7000 is to make that a new_eh abort
handler. The card every so often loses an IRQ (or we do something that
upsets it - who knows). In that situation we fake an IRQ event which
causes the card to recover and life to continue happily.
Providing you hold the lock all will then untangle.
