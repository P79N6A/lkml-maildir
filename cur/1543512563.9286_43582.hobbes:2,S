Subject: Updated i386 bootcode rewrite patch...

Simple patch that takes all the as86/ld86 stuff in arch/i386/boot and
makes it use standard GNU as/ld. Needs a minimum of binutils-2.9.1.0.7,
but that's it (that is the minimum per Documentation/Changes for 2.2
anyway). I'd love to see this squeeze into 2.3 as a 'bugfix' as no new
features are anywhere to be found, I swear. :)
This thing has been tested by many people, as it's been around since late
2.1, so it shouldn't break a single thing. Should be a simple drop-in
replacement type of deal. That being said though, I am not 100% sure of
the video.S code as I can't test it all (lack of hardware!), so if
something does break, it'll probably be there.
You can find it against 2.3.20 and a few older 2.3's at:

Pointless? Naw! Here are just a few of the good things that came out of it:
	o The kernel is no longer dependent on as86/ld86.
	o Consistency; this is the only part of the kernel still using
	  as86/ld86, everything else is gas or inlined (both AT&T).
	o build.c is a bit smaller since it doesn't have to mess
	  with minix style (aka ld86) output.
	o It removes some dead old code. Everybody loves those patches.
Files touched:
	arch/i386/boot/bootsect.S
	arch/i386/boot/setup.S
	arch/i386/boot/video.S
	arch/i386/boot/Makefile
	arch/i386/boot/tools/build.c
	arch/i386/boot/compressed/Makefile	(removed unneeded -m elf_i386)
	(up to date as of kernel v2.3.20)
Thanks.
