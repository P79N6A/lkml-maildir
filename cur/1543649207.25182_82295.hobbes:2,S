Maybe you could use the Linux Security Module hooks for
open() and exec() to pass a request to your virus scan
software ?
Note that this kernel module needs to be GPL, due to the
fact that it's a derived work of the kernel itself. This
only applies to the kernel module that asks the virus
scanner to check the files for virusses, not necessarily
the virus scanner itself.
