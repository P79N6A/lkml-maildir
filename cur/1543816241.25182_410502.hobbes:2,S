Currently, Linux's mlock for example, may fail with  only part of its
task finished.
While accroding to POSIX definition:
man mlock(2)
"
RETURN VALUE
       On success, mlock returns zero.  On error, -1 is returned, errno is set
       appropriately, and no changes are made to  any  locks  in  the  address
       space of the process.
