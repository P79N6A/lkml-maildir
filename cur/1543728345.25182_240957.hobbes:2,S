save some user info, suspend, standby, extreme throttling?
It should be somehow configurable in userspace.
For my opinion it would be nicest if kernel just throws a thermal event 
to /proc/acpi/event (it already does this, but immediately shuts down) 
and acpid or others should decide whether shutdown/suspend/standby or 
whatever should be done next.
I have a machine with a broken DSDT which sets the critical tp to 200°C, 
there always must be some HW shutdown..., or do you think this is too risky?
Some other related thing:
Why are no thermal events thrown if active/passive trip points are 
reached/sub-ceeded?
The only way at the moment to figure out in userspace whether the system 
is actively cooled or even slowed down by throttling (passive) is by 
polling /proc/acpi/thermal/*/state. Isn't the purpose of thermal events 
exactly for this?
I think about a possiblity to notify user if machine is slowed down.
