I have at least two drivers I look after where if you put the device into
D3 you lost. We survive because on a successful suspend/resume sequence
the BIOS puts it back coming out of suspend but that means we must not
put those devices into D3 ourselves ever - including during a suspend
before we are 100% comitted to the suspend completing or reboot.
