Then perhaps the body could be made into a small function or set of
functions.
I know the retry pattern is common. Though, as I remember it the control
flow was much more complex when goto was used for retry. Also, I seem to
recall do {} while () has favorable properties that goto lacks when it
comes to compiler optimization.

Except that you eventually have to lock ub0. Seems that the cache line
for that spinlock could bounce quite a bit in such a hot path.
Chandra, doesn't Resource Groups avoid walking more than 1 level up the
hierarchy in the "charge" paths?

	The only structural difference between this loop and another you have
is the "break" here. I was saying that you could pass a parameter into
the factored portion that tells it to return early if there is an error.
