Hi,
is this something to worry about ?
in dmesg:
PCI: Address space collision on region 9 of device VIA Technologies, Inc.
VT82C686 [Apollo Super ACPI] [8080:808f]
I know it might be unrelated with  ACPI being experimental but if the
kernel is compiled with ACPI instead of APM the machine (Presario 12XL300)
"cannot enter S5" when halting.
kernels 2.4.1 - 2.4.3
Thanks.
