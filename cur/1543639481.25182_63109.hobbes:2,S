This issue is more complicated than you might think.  Big companies with 
big pockets are very nervous about being too closely associated with 
Linux because of this problem.  Imagine that IBM, for example, starts
shipping IBM Linux.  Somewhere in the code there is something that 
infringes on a patent.  Given that it is IBM Linux, people can make 
the case that IBM should have known and should have fixed it and 
since they didn't, they get sued.  Notice that IBM doesn't ship 
their own version of Linux, they ship / support Red Hat or Suse
(maybe others, doesn't matter).  So if they ever get hassled, they'll
vector the problem to those little guys and the issue will likely
get dropped because the little guys have no money to speak of.
Maybe this is all good, I dunno, but be aware that the patents 
have long arms and effects.
