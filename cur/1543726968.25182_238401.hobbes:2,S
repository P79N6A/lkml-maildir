Hello Andrew,
in the meantime - after some testing - I found out the problem lies around nfs.
I cannot seem to change to directories (placed on nfs-volumes) whose
group-member I am.
Is this a known problem? Can I do something about it?
The situation is:
nfs-server 2.4.24
nfs-client 2.6.7
Client knows about 1000 groups and quite a lot users.
Mounting some directories from the nfs-server and checking out rights we found
that users belonging to a group owning a directory cannot access it. If the
exact same tree is located on the clients' local fs everything is fine.
Regards,
Stephan
