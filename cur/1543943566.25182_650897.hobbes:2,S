Subject: [PATCH 0/8] kgdb 2.6.25 version
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Per reqest on lkml, here are the individual kgdb patches
targeted at 2.6.25.
The kgdb tree has been collapsed review.  It includes
the kgdb core, the x86 arch, the kgdb8250 uart driver
and the kgdb console sharing driver.
Since the last time the kgdb patches were posted to LKML
several months ago, the kgdb core has undergone some
significant cleanup, as well as the kgdb I/O driver
interface.
All the kgdb hooks are initialized dynamically only when a
kgdb I/O module is configured. When not configured
kgdb will not exist in any kernel execution path.
Further comments, questions and patches are certainly
welcome.
Thanks,
Jason.
