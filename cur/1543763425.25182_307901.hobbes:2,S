Yep,  I need to force myself to write better docs...

It can not happen in the above case.
It can race with callback removing, but remove path 
call cancel_delayed_work() which calls del_timer_sync(), 
so above code can not be run or will not run, 
only after it refcnt is being checked to be zero.
It is probably an overhead since sinchronization is done
in other places.
All above barriers are introduced to remove already not theoretical
atomic vs. non-atomic reordering [ppc64 very like it],
when reference counter must be decremented after object was used, 
but due to reordering it can happen before use [and it will be seen
atomically on all CPUs], 
and other CPU may free object based on knowledge that
refcnt is zero.

It is not, just can be interrupted to check state befor timeout expires.
It is not a problem to remove signal interrupting here.

It is not exported, but is used in the other files which build
connector.
Only callback adding/removing and message sending functions are
exported.

Yep...

Test documentation module that lives in
Documentation/connector/cn_test.c
describes different usage cases for connector, and it uses
cn_netlink_send()
from irq context, which may race with the callback adding/removing.

It was introduced recently in network stack, where skb may be freed
erroneously due to atomic reordering.
It is similar case.
It could be just smb_mb(), but it is more expensive.

Return value is ignored here, but I will change function though.

I will remove signal interrupting.
According to wait queue inside the object - it can have it, but it will
be used only for waiting and repeated checking in a slow path.
Let's postpone it for now until other isssues are resolved first.

Before callback device is removed it is unregistered from the callback
subsystem,
so all messages will be discarded, until main socket is removed
(actually only released so it can be properly freed in network subsystem
later).
Andrew, thank you for your comments, 
I will cook up patches against your tree soon.
