Greetings,
  For those interested in living on the bleeding edge and have the scars
to show for it I offer the following bit code.
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/tgall/pop/pop/pop-0.9.1-patch.gz
  Apply against stock 2.4.18
  POP as some of you may or may not know is an effort underway by a
number of parties to produce a low cost PowerPC based motherboard. Since
a couple of evaluation boards are available and commercial boards are
just around the corner I thought I'd post this. This code is
experimental, don't nag me for content, quality, or code format. It's
meant to work, that's it. Bigger hammer technology at it's best. The
next patch will contain the proper board detection code.
  A *LARGE* portion of the patch is bringing 2.4.18 sources up to the
level of the ppc _devel bk tree. Unfortunate but necessary.
  Enjoy,
  Tom
