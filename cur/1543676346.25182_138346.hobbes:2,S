Some more data points:
  o 2.5.70 fails as well.
  o ext2 on 2.5.70, too.
  o Above errors are definitely critical. 8-(
  o It seems as if the kernel assumes that a file is a directory.  (At
    least after running 2.5.70/ext2 for a while, e2fsck had some
    problems regenerating a proper file system structure and marked a
    few files as directories.)
  o Vanilla 2.4.20 is rock solid on the same hardware (no more file
    system corruption after downgrade).
