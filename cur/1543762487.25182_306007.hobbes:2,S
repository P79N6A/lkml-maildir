I agree it is quite confusing wording.  Probably should remove all 
reference to PATA in the CONFIG_SCSI_ATA_PIIX Kconfig entry.
The comment is referring to the somewhat-hidden fact that if you define 
ATA_ENABLE_PATA in include/linux/libata.h, then libata will support your 
Intel PIIX PATA controllers, in addition to the Intel PIIX SATA controllers.
However, since ATAPI support isn't yet stable, this is of limited 
usefulness.
