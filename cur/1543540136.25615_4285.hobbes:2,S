I am using a P166 PC, the first 3 bugs were in kernel-2.4.0 since the
test1 release:
bug#1: If I disable Power Management, my PC clock lags when I leave the
computer without any activity, I have to compile APM BIOS support IN the
kernel (NOT even as a module) in order to solve this problem. And yes, my
motherboard does support APM.
bug #2: iptables must be compiled into the kernel not as a module, when I
compiled it as a module, and then depmod it, I got unresolved symbols
error messages. (I didn't try to compile it as a module in releases after
test2).
bug #3: IPv6 wierd thing: after I compiled iptables support IN the kernel, 
I get those messages when I establish a tunnel:
Jun 23 15:06:45 ants kernel: nf_hook: hook 0 already set.
Jun 23 15:06:45 ants kernel: skb: pf=10 (unowned) dev=sit1 len=64
Jun 23 15:06:45 ants kernel: nf_hook: hook 0 already set.
Jun 23 15:06:45 ants kernel: skb: pf=10 (unowned) dev=sit1 len=64
and for example when I attempted to 'ping6 3ffe:604:2:bfff::15', or try
to browse an IPv6 site (I have an IPv6 aware browser) I got those
messages :
Jun 23 15:16:54 ants kernel: nf_hook: hook 0 already set.
Jun 23 15:16:54 ants kernel: skb: pf=10 (unowned) dev=sit1 len=104
Jun 23 15:16:54 ants kernel: nf_hook: hook 1 already set.
Jun 23 15:16:54 ants kernel: skb: pf=10 (unowned) dev=sit1 len=104
Jun 23 15:16:54 ants kernel: nf_hook: hook 4 already set.
Jun 23 15:16:54 ants kernel: skb: pf=2 (owned) dev=ppp0 len=124
Jun 23 15:16:54 ants kernel: PROTO=41 163.121.29.81:0 193.126.85.29:0
L=124 S=0x00 I=0 F=0x4000 T=90
[pasted from /var/log/messages]
bug #4: releases starting from test4 (btw, I never tested test3 release),
had a wierd problem, if I start the X Window, then return back to one of
the consoles (by pressing ALT + F1 for example), I'd find the console
colors crazy, right now my console is in blue on black instead of white on
black, but if I leave the PC for sometime without any activity & then come
back and move a mouse or press a keyboard key, the console colors return
to white on black as the ordinary case. As you may expect, if I return to
the X window screen again (by pressing ALT + F7) then going back to one of
the consoles, again I find the console colors messed up (blue on black
again!!!). Anyone knows a solution for this ?
thanks in advance...
