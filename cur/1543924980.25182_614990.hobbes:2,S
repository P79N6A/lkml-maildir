Subject: [patch] tweak driver documentation for rtc periodic
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

The max_user_freq member is not really meant for RTC drivers to modify, so
update the rtc documentation so drivers writers know what is expected of them
when handling periodic events.

 If all else fails, check out the rtc-test.c driver!
