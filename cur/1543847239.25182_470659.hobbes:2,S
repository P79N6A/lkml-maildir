Hi!
All I wanted was a cheap IDE controller to attach a spool disk for
my backups. What I got was a RAID controller with the it8212 chip.
Ok, I thought, just ignore that. The module was loaded and the disk
mounted without a hitch.
But as soon as the backup started writing to the disk, CPU usage
went up to about 100%, a lot (rough estimage 50%) of that "system".
Strange enough in itself, but it did not only affect the one process
actually accessing that disk, but apparently all processes doing I/O
(or perhaps doing I/O to any IDE device?). Most notably one ogg123
(feeding on hold music to our pbx), which usually uses about 5% CPU,
went up to 25%...
Even if the driver is strange, what takes up the "user" CPU cycles?
Looking through the logs I notices that it821x was in "smart" mode,
so I restarted the system with "noraid=1" to get into "pass through".
Now everything is back to normal. A large dd did about 40MB/s without
disturbing other processes.
Wasn't smart mode the one supposed to be the one reducing CPU load?
BTW, my hardware setup (lspci):

The one with a name to long for the buffer is the it8212.
Root partition is on a raid 1 spanning hda and hdc, the spool disk is hde.
