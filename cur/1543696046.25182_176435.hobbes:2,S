I made the quick fix (disabling rq_mergeable) and started the load test.
Will let it run for a week or so.
Thanks for the help!

FYI an observation from my last test: the read latency seems to be much
improved and more consistent under this kernel (2.4.23pre6aa3, before
the oops and before this fix).  The maximum latency seemed steady over
the whole test without any of the longish pauses that showed up under
2.4.19. Quite a difference.
