  The problem with the userspace library is standardization. What
  would be needed is a userspace library that has a extensible plugin
  interface that is standardized. Otherwise we would need lots of
  different libraries, and I seriously doubt that 1) this will happen
  and 2) we get all Linux programs to be patched to use it.
