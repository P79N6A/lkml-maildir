hi!
all my usb devices work, but they are very slow (12 times slower) with kernels
2.4.14 and higher. it definetly was ok with 2.4.10.
tested with rio500 and my digital camera. it seems fast enough for the graphics
tablet.
i've seen this reported before, but no answers given. the problem persists for over
a month now, and i tried nearly every new kernel/pre-kernel.
there is no usb error in "messages", everything looks fine.
MfG,
	Armin Obersteiner
