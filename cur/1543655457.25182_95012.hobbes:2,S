The PC only has so many possible keycodes (with E0 and E1 it's still
in the sub-300 range.)  It won't fit within 128, but I would really
like an algorithmic mapping from scancodes to keycodes so we don't
continue to have this problem.
For example, using a 16-bit keycode model:
	Scancode		Keycode (binary)
	mxxxxxxx	 	m0000000 0xxxxxxx
	E0 mxxxxxxx		m0000000 1xxxxxxx
	E1 mxxxxxxx yyyyyyyy	mxxxxxxx yyyyyyyy
m = make/break bit
