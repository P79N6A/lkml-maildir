Hi,
is there an easy way to identify all security-related patches out of the
mass of patches floating around  on linux.bkbits.net or the kernel bugzilla?
I'm running 2.6.8.1 and would like to keep it as stable as possible, thus,
only apply security patches. Currently I'm searching for "security" and
alike on bitkeeper, but there seems to be no consistent marking.
For instance, it would be nice if all security fixes contained a consistent
marker like "[SECURITY]" in the changeset comments (like the reiserfs xattr/acl
patch does), so that it would be easy to identify them. Or setting some kind
of flag to such patches (I've no idea what bitkeeper allows one to do...).
cu,
Frank
