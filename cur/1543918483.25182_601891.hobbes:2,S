Er, no it doesn't, try again. ts_shift returns the transfer size _shift_.
The comment refers to the DMA count, which is a different matter. Your
32-byte transfer where you want the >> 5 shift == ts_shift[XMIT_SZ_256BIT],
and there's nothing wrong with that. So the issue becomes why you don't
get a ts_shift[] offset of XMIT_SZ_256BIT for that channel, and that's
the bug that has to be fixed.

So for PVR2 cascade, what does the CHCR value work out to? Both
CHCR_TS_MASK and CHCR_TS_SHIFT haven't changed for SH7750, so this
suggests that either the CHCR value is just wrong or we've had a
long-standing bug with the CHCR.TS mask.
Either way, we are not going to hardcode a ts_shift value when the CHCR
has all of the information encoded in it!
