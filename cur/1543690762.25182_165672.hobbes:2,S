Yeah, I should have thought of that. Sorry.

Hmm, obviously I misunderstood how this worked. Does that mean that 
these two lines:
#define BLKGETSIZE64	_IOR(0x12,114,sizeof(__uint64_t))
#define BLKGETSIZE64	_IOR(0x12,114,__uint64_t)
actually produce different ioctl numbers? If so, then I don't 
understand how the kernel can continue to offer the old/invalid 
interface when the new _IOR macro won't accept the first version any 
longer.
