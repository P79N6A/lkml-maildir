So things like:
	/* mmap a file, hopefully this will use a small number of
	   large pages */
	ptr = mmap(NULL,262144ul,PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,MAP_SHARED,fd,0);
	/* protect middle part of file -- will probably mean the
	   pages get remapped into small pages too */
	err = mprotect(ptr + 65536,pgsize,PROT_NONE);
will make the mm code to do clever tricks? Surely if this operation
is expensive (perhaps it need not be?) dynamic loaders and such will
pay the price?
