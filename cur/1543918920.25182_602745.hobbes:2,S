Exactly. I'm also testing older distros quite regularly with new kernels 
and there's it's useful to have an impression of a kernel's output at a 
glance. Adding _any_ userspace change (even if i wanted to do it, which 
i dont) is out of question. So these are distinct, well-defined usecases 
that nobody has brought any coherent argument against yet. VGA isnt 
going away anytime soon, certainly not on my testboxes.
