Speaking of automating.. I created a little .vimrc add-on which helps
doing sem2mutex type changes. Here's the chunk I added,
    function Semtomutex( lo )
        exe '%s/down(&'.a:lo.')/mutex_lock\(\&'.a:lo.'\)/g'
        exe '%s/down_trylock(&'.a:lo.')/mutex_trylock\(\&'.a:lo.'\)/g'
        exe '%s/up(&'.a:lo.')/mutex_unlock\(\&'.a:lo.'\)/g'
        exe '%s/DECLARE_MUTEX('.a:lo.')/DEFINE_MUTEX\('.a:lo.'\)/g'
    endfunction
    map <C-\>o :call Semtomutex("<c-r><c-w>")<CR>
I just finished this about 30 seconds ago, and although I tested it once
I would guess it might have some bugs.. If you add it to your .vimrc ,
then you move your cursor over the lock name and hit Ctrl-\-o ,it will
convert all the calls for that lock name.. The list of calls it converts
isn't complete tho (down, down_trylock, and up) ..
I hope people still review the lock usage tho, since it's critical.
