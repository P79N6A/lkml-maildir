So what is your advice?  Would the "correct" action be to take a
snapshot of the appropriate kernel directories against which glibc is
built? (ie to copy the directories (or those files needed) to
/usr/include/asm and /usr/include/linux)
On the other hand, if you are building "system level" tools (eg which
communicate with device drivers directly using IOCTLs) you may need to
use the kernel header files, in which case I suppose you should
include them from the kernel source tree not /usr/include.
In both case, I think the problem is not so much in code which you
write yourself (where you control include paths etc) but in building
3rd party applications which may not have used the "correct" include
paths and therefore will not build "out of the box".
