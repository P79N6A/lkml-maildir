No offence, but you obviously assume too much.

If the "int" happens to be negative, the comparison will say that the
"int" is smaller than the "unsigned char". This is the expected result.
What exactly is wrong with this?
So I have this number, -200, which is stored in an int. I have this other
number, 200, which is stored in an unsigned char. Everybody in his right
mind will agree that -200 is smaller than 200, the compiler will do just
that, yet you disagree???

So now you're turning it around. If you compare a long with unsigned char,
there is no issue. If you compare long with unsigned int, you get the
right result on the alpha and a warning on x86. If you compare long with
unsigned long, you get a warning period.

And read above. You get the right result on the alpha and a warning on the 
x86. I don't see the problem with that.
If you want to be 100% paranoid, change the sign-compare warning into an 
error, so people don't ignore it. That's a much better alternative, and 
gcc supports it.

No. It means I suppress the gcc warning before I get a chance to see it. 
It does NOT necessarily mean I (and by "I" I mean your average programmer) 
think about the range issues, I just think Linux min/max are broken.

Duplicating types all over the place is a bad thing, however.
