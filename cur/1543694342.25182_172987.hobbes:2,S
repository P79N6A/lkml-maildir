There is a good reason for this: You can implement pages containing only
zeroes very efficiently in the kernel. You can map pages containing only
zeroes to a single physical page in the kernel (the ZERO_PAGE). You can
ignore the refcounting on this page and save precious cache flushes and
much more by doing this in the kernel.
Compare an application with memset() and mmaping of /dev/zero in
multiple processes, writing to only some of these pages later.

That's a price worth as an "default to off" option. We have much more
seldom used stuff in the kernel and maintain it, which is a bigger mess
than this.
