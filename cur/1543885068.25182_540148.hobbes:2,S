There is also the obvious tradeoff of  "easier to update frequently"
vs. "easier to write" which is a primary factor.
1) as distinct .ko files smb2 and cifs can be updated independently
(the former marked broken/experimental).  Updating smb2 won't
risk breaking cifs
2)  but implemented in the same module, there is somewhat less code to write.
