Quite true. The drives really need to get an "oh heck, the power's about 
to die. Quick, tidy up" signal from the outside world (like down the 
ribbon). Cheap, at the limit, PSUs probably couldn't give enough notice 
to be very helpful. Server grade ones should - they can usually ride 
over brief hiccups in the power, so they should be able to give a few 
10s of ms notice before the regulated power lines start to droop. 
Perhaps the ATA command set should include such a feature, so the OS 
could take instruction from the hardware on the power situation, and 
tell the drives what to do.

Steve
