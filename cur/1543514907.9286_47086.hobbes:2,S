Ah.  I suppose I was incomplete in expressing my thought, and I'll try
again:  I was thinking that in your writepage function, you could mark it
dirty and bump the page count.  Since the page's lock is held when
writepage is called, you don't have to worry about incrementing count
twice.  Multiple writepage()s can occur simultaneously, whereas only one
write() can occur on a file at one time.  Am I making sense?  In any case,
if you haven't looked over Eric's shmfs patches (see the linux-mm
archives), do -- he implemented dirty pages in the page cache, which will 
be worth revisting during 2.5.
