Absolutely. GIT isn't quite at the point where I can start using it yet,
though.
I could actually start committing patches, but I want to make sure that I
can also do automated simple merges, so that there is any _point_ to doing
this in the first place. My plan is to not be very good at merging (in 
particular, I don't see GIT resolving renames _at_all_), but my hope is 
that the people who used to merge with me using BK might be able to still 
do so using GIT, as long as we try actively to be very careful.

I didn't even set up the list. I think it's Bottomley. I'm cc'ing him just 
so that he sees the message, but I don't actually expect him to do 
anything about it. I'm not even ready to start _testing_ real merges yet. 
But I hope that I can get non-conflicting merges done fairly soon, and 
maybe I can con James or Jeff or somebody to try out GIT then...
