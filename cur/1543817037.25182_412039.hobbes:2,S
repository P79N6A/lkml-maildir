This isn't the case.  If this_cpu is idle tl_per_task will be set to 
SCHED_LOAD_SCALE (see implementation of cpu_avg_load_per_task()) and 
that expression should succeed unless the value returned by 
target_load(cpu, idx) is bigger than SCHED_LOAD_SCALE.  This is exactly 
the same as would have happened with the original code.
(BTW cpu_avg_load_per_task()'s original implementation would have had 
the effect you describe but it was modified when it was realized that it 
would break the code in a lot of places (not just here).  The thinking 
now is that if there isn't enough data available to calculate the 
average load per task for a run queue then the correct value to use is 
the theoretical average i.e. SCHED_LOAD_SCALE.)

Nevertheless, in some cases, it was difficult to decide which run 
queue's average load per task should be used to replace SCHED_LOAD_SCALE 
and a careful review of the code by those with expertise in this area 
would be appreciated as I may have made mistakes.
