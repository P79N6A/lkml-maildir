I think this one is now clear to me, tcp_fragment/collapse adjusts 
fackets_out (incorrectly) also for reno flow when there were some dupACKs 
that made sacked_out != 0. Could you please try if patch below proves all 
them to be of non-SACK origin... In case that's true, it's rather 
harmless, I'll send a fix on Monday or so (this would anyway be needed)... 
If you find out that them occur with SACK enabled flow, that would be
more interesting and requires more digging...
