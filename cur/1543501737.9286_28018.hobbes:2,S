Hi,
Ever since the upgrade from 2.0.x to 2.2.x I'm having trouble with the
network interface on my Multia's, using the Tulip-driver.  _After_ an
ftp/smb transfer _from_ the multia the interface has no network
connection, while the file being copied did get over the line fine. It
doesn't matter if the file is small or big. Usually an 'ifconfig eth0
down; ifconfig eth0 up' makes ik work again.
