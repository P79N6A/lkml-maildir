Problem is that it allows someone with sniffer access to your network to
make a pretty good estimate of your random pool. If you search the archives
there was a big discussion about it some months ago. Currently there is no
good solution, except for using add-on hardware that offers randomness 
(that can be as simple as a spare sound card with some noise input)
