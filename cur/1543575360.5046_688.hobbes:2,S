Ok guys i take your arguments...
(i really loved to hear them)
and i'd like to continue them in a
private discussion( but i am 
tired now ... :) )
but a last one i cannot resist...
<sarcasm>
but why are your ideas not widespread and 
so successful like kde,gnome,windows?
maybe because they suck at some point?
</sarcasm>
Regards (and please flame me private ... :)) 
Dietmar
