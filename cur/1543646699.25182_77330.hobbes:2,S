The big drag on making progress on the desktop is the inertia of
existing applications. Speed/Performance is rarely a problem... just
wait a few months for more power or lower price. PCs are already
overpowered for the typical desktop workload.
Progress in that area is always possible but it will be very slow and
marginal.
