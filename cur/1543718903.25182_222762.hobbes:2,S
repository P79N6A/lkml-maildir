Erm,no. In fact it could even fix XFree86 for that, because the way
they do it currently in user space is racy and the kernel doing it 
differently would fix that race. But I would still recommend to 
not apply it, since it is somewhat risky e.g. for triggering 
new hardware bugs and it is not really needed and would dilute the
message of freeze %) XFree86 should be fixed in user space to use the proper
access methods provided by the kernel (/proc/sys etc.)
