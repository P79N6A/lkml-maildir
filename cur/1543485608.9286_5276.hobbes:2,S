Hello,
Is anyone doing (or have DONE) a GPL sound driver for the Yamaha YMF724
chip?  If not, I have one and *I* am going to do it.  I am aware of the
commercial driver for this chip that is coming from the OSS folks, but
I don't want to wait and I don't like paying for stuff that I can't fix
when the kernel version changes.
I estimate doing my own won't be too hard; I have done drivers for other
OSes before (even DMA ones, although not sound, at least not recently).
There are LOTs of examples.  The chip appears to be adequately
documented.  Piece o' cake, eh?
Sage advice anyone?
Thanks.
