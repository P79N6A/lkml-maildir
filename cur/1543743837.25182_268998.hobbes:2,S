I'm not right now in front of this one, but from memory, I believe I
set "vga=771" in lilo, and 773 should be 1280x1024. That's easy, you
take the mode you want from the documentation (Documentation/fb/vesafb.txt
I believe), you add 0x200 (512) to it and you use this value. So in my
case, 771 = 0x303 = 0x200 + 0x103, which should be the mode for 1024x768x8.
Hope this helps,
Willy
