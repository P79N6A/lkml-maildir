So what is the proper way to debug [on x86]?
I like kdb, but I don't like patching the kernel with it
every time that I download a new kernel.
I've heard that some other arch's have debug capabilities
in the kernel source tree.  Is this correct?
Is there any chance of having kdb added to the kernel
source tree?
