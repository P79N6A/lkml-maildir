Hi,
I hope this doesn't turn out to be a stupid question..
I've suddenly started getting "modprobe: can't locate module
sound-service-0-0" errors from kmod. This is understandable as I don't have
sound-service-0-* aliased to anything, but sound-slot-0 is aliased to sb.o,
which seems to provide the relevant service (mixer). The following bit of
code appears in sound_core.c:soundcore_open()
        s = __look_for_unit(chain, unit);
        if (s == NULL) {
                char mod[32];
                spin_unlock(&sound_loader_lock);
                /*
                 *  Please, don't change this order or code.
                 *  For ALSA slot means soundcard and OSS emulation code
                 *  comes as add-on modules which aren't depend on
                 *  ALSA toplevel modules for soundcards, thus we need
                 *  load them at first.   [Jaroslav Kysela <perex@jcu.cz>]
                 */
                sprintf(mod, "sound-slot-%i", unit>>4);
                request_module(mod);
                sprintf(mod, "sound-service-%i-%i", unit>>4, chain);
                request_module(mod);
                spin_lock(&sound_loader_lock);
                s = __look_for_unit(chain, unit);
	}
	...
Should this not actually do something like
        s = __look_for_unit(chain, unit);
        if (s == NULL) {
                char mod[32];
                spin_unlock(&sound_loader_lock);
                sprintf(mod, "sound-slot-%i", unit>>4);
                request_module(mod);
                spin_lock(&sound_loader_lock);
                s = __look_for_unit(chain, unit);
	}
	if( s == NULL ) {
                char mod[32];
                spin_unlock(&sound_loader_lock);
                sprintf(mod, "sound-service-%i-%i", unit>>4, chain);
                request_module(mod);
                spin_lock(&sound_loader_lock);
                s = __look_for_unit(chain, unit);
	}
	...
? I don't claim to understand much of the interactions between the various
bits of the sound subsystem, but if the module aliased by sound-slot-X
provides the required service, it's pointless to try to find another module
to do it, surely?
