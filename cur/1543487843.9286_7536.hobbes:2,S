From the replies I have seen, am I right to infer that fcntl locking
*should* work to a remote Linux NFS server (using Linux 2.2.2) ?
I have client side locking working using statd-0.2.4, but server side fails.
Is there something I need to configure ?
[ also, quotas appear to be ignored, using nfs-server-2.2beta37-1
  remote NFS clients can go over quota, and take partitions over 100%
  Do I need to use knfsd? I note it says "If you want quota to work for knfsd"
  Will "quota-2.1.1xx.diff" work for nfs-server-2.2beta37 as well ?
]
[ Also, is the raidtools-0.90 (or later) in a state such that its LVM
  can be used in conjunction with resize2fs to have "growable" FSs ?
  Is there a way to "suspect" NFS serving of a FS while it is dismounted,
  resized and remounted, or do I have to take the NIC down as I do now?
