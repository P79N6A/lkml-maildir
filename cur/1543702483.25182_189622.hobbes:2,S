but the user does not control 'newsize'. Can you outline a scenario in 
where the value could overflow?

no, the value of bytes is really limited. Again, can you suggest a
scenario in where this could overflow?

LDT size is limited by LDT_ENTRY_SIZE*LDT_ENTRIES. We explicitly truncate
bytecount to this range so unsigned vs. signed makes no difference.

that's quite common for the interface definitions. Since we are on x86
unsigned long == unsigned int.

yep, you are right, this is the wrong style.
