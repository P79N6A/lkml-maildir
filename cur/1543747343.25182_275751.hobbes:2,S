Please use:
 	include/$arch/user-asm/xxxx.h
 	include/user/xxxx.h
	
This allows us to
1) To include file foo.h we still distingush between user versus user-asm:
#include <user/foo.h>		(include/user/foo.h)
#include <user-asm/foo.h>	(include/$arch/user-asm/foo.h)
2) No symlinks needed - just proper options to gcc
