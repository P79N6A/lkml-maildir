Hi,
I saw reports about that bug once or twice, but no answer about it 
(only someone pointed it to nv drivers). Well it is _not_ connected to any
drivers I think.
Here is oops:
  kernel BUG at page_alloc.c:102!
 invalid operand: 0000

 Code: 0f 0b 66 00 5a 11 2d c0 89 d8 2b 05 f0 62 43 c0 69 c0 a3 8b
It goes to syslog twice every 30 seconds when the traffic is high, or a bit slower 
if not. Machine is working as far as I can see normaly. (ps, ls, df and so on works,
even other deamons work ie. sendmail, ssh and so on).
Call Trace and Code are _always_ the same.
Will it be fixed in 2.4.21 or there is some patch around ? (I've tried to find it but
couldn't)
Greetings
	Michal
