Just in case Al didn't make it clear enough in the recent thread:
You cannot fix a compiler warning!
Either the code is wrong or it is right.  A compiler warning can
indicate that code is wrong, or it is a false positive.  If the code
is wrong, fix the _code_.  If it isn't, ignore the warning or fix the
_compiler_.
That said, your patch looks as if it would actually fix the code.  I'm
not firm enough with NAT to confirm that, though.  So if it fixes the
code, please state exactly that.
