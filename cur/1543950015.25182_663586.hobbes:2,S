 CC:ing the linux-usb mailing list might help out more :)
parsing the options did change a bit in 2.6.25-rc, but I don't think it
would have changed this.  Can you revert the patch at git id
2e4f3c02239d4c7c454604715db619bc971b15eb and see if it fixes the problem
for you or not?
Hm, I see this here as well, not good...
thanks,
