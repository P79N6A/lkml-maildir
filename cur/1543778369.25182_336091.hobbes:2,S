OK, well I queued this up, without a changelog.  Because you didn't send
one.  Please do so.  As it adds a new feature, quite a bit of info is
relevant.
It should include a description of what the patch tries to do, and how it
does it.  It should include a description of any known shortcomings.  If
any user configuration is needed then that should be placed somewhere under
Documentation/
Take a look at how other people document their feature additions and you'll
get the idea.
Please don't send multiple patches per email.  In this case I did the
handwork and put both diffs into the same patch.
Personally, I don't like this:
+config SWSUSP_ENCRYPT
+	bool "Encrypt suspend image"
+	depends on SOFTWARE_SUSPEND && CRYPTO=y && (CRYPTO_AES=y || CRYPTO_AES_586=y || CRYPTO_AES_X86_64=y)
This requires the user to hunt around in config until all the right options
are enabled to permit SWSUSP_ENCRYPT to appear in config.  That can be
quite frustrating and is very poor UI.
For a top-level feature such as this it is much better to always offer the
feature to the user and to then use `select' to turn on all the
infrastructure bits which the user will need.  Make the computer do the
work rather than the user.
Yes, it might be a bit tricky in this case because you have a dependency on
one of the AES encryption types, but it would be good if you can come up
with something which doesn't force the user into a game of hide-and-seek.
