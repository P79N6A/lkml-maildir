Language confusion - "if you want to make the case" = "if you want to argue
that a value of rp_filter = 2 should in future (after you implement it) mean
apply a both way rule - then I agree)
I'm glad about your RFC1812 cite btw - the number of problems I've seen with
one of the distros defaulting to rp_filter = 1 was large.
