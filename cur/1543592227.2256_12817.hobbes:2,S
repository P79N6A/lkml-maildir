I'm not sure anyone is willing to claim ownership :)
I did not realize that syncppp does not implement
all the RFC1661 states. That's simply broken :(
A proper state machine implementation would be nice.
On the other hand, it works in a minimal way
for most people and it's supposed to be folded
into the generic PPP implementation someday.
So there's not much point in trying to overhaul the code.
