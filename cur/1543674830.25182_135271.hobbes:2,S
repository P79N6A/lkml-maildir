Btw, Jeff, while I agree about not boring about old PATA hardware,
I'd still like to see support for MDMA modes in there. For once,
there is no real difference in supporting both UDMA and MDMA, it's
really just a matter of extending the range of the "mode" parameter,
and I'd like to be able to use the driver on configs like pmacs which
typically have a U/DMA capable channel for the internal HD and one
MDMA only channel (ATAPI CD/DVD, ZIP) without having to play bad tricks
to get both drivers up.
Ben.
