I've put up a new version of iwlwifi (0.0.6) with significant changes to 
the patch_kernel scripts as well as including Pavel's patch to KSRC.
I performed some build testing with 2.6.18 and wireless-dev @ commit 
f66e5aaa88c1c0a7ee6c6427d6535ed8afd35427 (Jan 8).

Let me know if it is still breaking.
Thanks,
James
