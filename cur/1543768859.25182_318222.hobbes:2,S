hm, you are right - the 'kick other CPUs' portion of RT-overload 
handling (which is a new scheduler feature currently being tested in the 
-RT kernel) is missing this step. So we might as well force a reschedule 
from the IPI handler - the way you suggested it. We might overdo 
scheduling a bit, but it cannot hurt - and it will definitely make a 
difference for the case where an RT task is waiting to be run.
the vanilla kernel is not affected.
