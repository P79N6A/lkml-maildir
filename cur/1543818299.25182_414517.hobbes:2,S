Before hitting the warning pop-up about git version compatibility at
qgit launch,please note that a git with --boundary option support
is required.
git-rev-list --boundary has been merged after git-1.3.0.rc1, so better
upgrade git to latest upstream snapshot git-1.3.0rc3
Of course final qgit-1.2 will be out only _after_  released git-1.3.0
