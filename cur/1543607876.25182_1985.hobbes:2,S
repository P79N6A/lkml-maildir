You can hotplug PCI. It's called cardbus. There is also full hotplug PCI
in the -ac kernel tree for people with expensive motherboards. The kernel
handles a fair bit of it ok. Hotplugging the video console isnt a good
idea right now, and the disk drivers need work, but for basic stuff like
network cards it works out.
