Actually, I think some platforms (ppc64) will explode if we do the
local_irq_enable() prior to time_init().
So I suggest you look at the latter option:
- change time_init() so that it doesn't actually touch the HPET hardware
  in the HPET timer case.
- add late_time_init() after mem_init().
- then do calibrate_delay().
Or whatever.  The bottom line is that init/main.c is fragile, but not
inviolable ;)
