hi all,
i was finally able to trigger a ppp bug that's plagued me sporadically
and inconsistently. it turns out the following is happening (which
explains the difficulty in repeating it):
	  1) linux gets a vj compressed packet
	  2) it calls rcv_proto_vjc_comp() (line 2050 in ppp.c)
	  3) for certain packets, slhc_uncompress() returns an
	     uncompressed frame < compressed one. as a result,
	     skb->len > new_count + PPP_HDRLEN (by 7 bytes)
	  4) pow! skb_put() dies horribly.
before i stick in the obvious patch, i just want to make sure that
it's valid to have uncompressed packets smaller than the corresponding
compressed ones.
