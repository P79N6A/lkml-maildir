[ I assume you're talking about running on native hardware. ]
In the current paravirt changes in the kernel, many of the
paravirtualized operations are implemented as (expensive) indirect calls
via paravirt_ops.  Among the changes in the paravirt patches I posted
yesterday is an enhanced patching mechanism which inlines a lot of the
common operations, and converts the rest into direct calls.
I haven't done any detailed measurements on what effect this will have,
but it does bring the actual executed instruction stream much closer to
the !CONFIG_PARAVIRT case, and so I would hope it would recover most or
all of the performance loss you've noticed.
