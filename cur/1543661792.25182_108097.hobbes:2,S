I'm just wondering whether
if (newsize > 4096) newsize = 4096;
can be removed, because:
hwrate is verified to be between 3 and 255, so 10000/hwrate will be
39 < hwrate < 3333
and ignoring the lower two bits, (& ~3),
36 < hwrate < 3332
so:
for (new2size = 128; new2size < newsize; new2size <<= 1) ;
will never cause new2size to evaluate to more than 4096 anyway.
(as far as I can see).
John.
