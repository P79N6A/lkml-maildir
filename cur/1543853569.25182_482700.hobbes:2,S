The variable is set few lines before. So, it should be OK to switch on
that 
variable set and one of the two cases will execute. isn't it? Or am 
I missing something?

Get_cur_freq_on_cpu will not work on SYSTEM_IO space as ACPI does not
have an interface to get the current frequency. It only has a interface
to say whether the last transitions tried was successful or not.
So, if indeed a change in switch is required, first option should be
good...
