I agree with you. But the previous code was more conservative and may slowly
(just from theory pt of view... I don't have an example to show this..)
balance towards the desired state. With this code, I feel we are
aggressive. for example, on a DP system: if I run one high priority
and two low priority processes, they keep hopping from one processor
to another... you may argue it is because of the "top" or some other
process... I agree that it is the case.. But same thing doesn't happen
with the previous version.. I like the conservative approach...

All I am saying is we are more aggressive.. I don't have any issue with
the desired outcome..
