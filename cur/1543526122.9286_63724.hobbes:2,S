I believe you misunderstand my point.  I specifically used the word
"reactor" rather than "bomb" because I agree that a microcode patch facility
on a processor is potentially a very useful thing.  "Nuclear" refers to the
amount of power available.  I feel that this proposal is to pull the
containment rods 90% out when the reactor designer says not to pull them out
more than 75%.
Of course if/when things do blow up a rebuild & restore from backup is
always possible, so the analogy has its limits...
