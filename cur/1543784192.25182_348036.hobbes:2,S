Yes, I agree, will perhaps add a min_skip member to the structure.

Thanks for confirming, I wasn't sure if that was the case or not.

Ah, true. maybe current_dyn_tick_source or something to that effect?
Because there should only be one dyn_tick_timer, yes?

Yes, certainly, in fact, I think some of these functions may provide
impetus to eventually clean up other code.

Thanks, I forwarded him the first plan I submitted a few days ago, but
didn't add him to the Cc.

I meant more for making sure we can manage that one CPU may have access
to the PIT, but others may not (CPU0)? More along the lines of diverse
h/w setups where perhaps the HPET is tied to one chip, but not the
other. So, actually different hardware per-cpu. If that can't be the
case (at least not currently), then the nohz_mask and spin_lock is
enough to guarantee we don't muck with cpus accidentally.
Thanks,
Nish
