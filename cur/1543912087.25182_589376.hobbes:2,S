So it is about two bugs.
1) kbuild (genksyms) fails to generate CRC for some symbols
2) allow userspace to parse the header
As for 2 we already use sed to remove a lot of stuff in our headers
so why do we use another approach here?
As for 1 I will try to teach genksyms to accept __extension__ but
it seems leess trivial than I expected (most be fooling myself somehow).
