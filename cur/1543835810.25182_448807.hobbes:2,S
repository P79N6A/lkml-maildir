Something has gone rather wrong here.

__svc_create() is:
__svc_create(struct svc_program *prog, unsigned int bufsize, int npools,
	   void (*shutdown)(struct svc_serv *serv))
so heaven knows what tree you're patching.
Incremental patches really are preferred.  So we can see what people are
monkeying with ;)
After fixing the rejects and cleaning a few things up, your proposed change

Which shouldn't have compiled, due to the missing forward declaration.  And
I'd be surprised if it worked very well with CONFIG_NUMA=n.  And it's
naughty to be sneaking general library functions into the sunrpc code
anyway.
Please,
- Write a standalone patch which adds highest_possible_node_id() to
  lib/cpumask.c(?)
  Make sure it's inside #ifdef CONFIG_NUMA
  Remember to export it to modules.
  Provide a !CONFIG_NUMA version in include/linux/nodemask.h which just
  returns constant zero.
  Consider doing something more efficient than the for_each_node() loop. 
  Although I'm not sure what that would be, given that we don't have
  find_last_bit().
- Provide an incremental patch against
  knfsd-make-rpc-threads-pools-numa-aware.patch which utilises
  highest_possible_node_id().
  A replacement patch will be grudgingly accepted, but I'll only go and
  turn it into an incremental one, so you can't hide ;)
- Test it real good.  Modular, non-modular, NUMA, non-NUMA, !SMP.
Thanks.
