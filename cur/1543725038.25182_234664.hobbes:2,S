I must have missed that thread...  Anyway, that's a good idea.

Yeah, I didn't mean to imply that atomics were unique to this patch.

Which is good.

That's good, I didn't think that RCU would cause starvation, but based on 
previous reading of the code it seemed like it would hurt a lot in other 
ways... but I'm definitely not an expert in that area.
