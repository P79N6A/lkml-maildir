Now that you mention it, I have this dim memory of the one-instruction
"sti-shadow" actually disabling NMI's (and debug traps) too. The CPU 
literally doesn't test for async events following "sti". 
Or maybe that was "mov->ss". That one also has that strange "black hole"  
for one instruction.
Hmm.. You could be evil and try to fill up 64kB worth of memory with a 
"mov %ax,%ss", and jump to it in vm86 mode and see what happens. The eip 
will just keep wrapping around...
