Then I would like to exercise my right under the GPL to aquire the source code 
for the firmware (and the required compilers, starting with genfw.c which is 
mentioned in acenic_firmware.h) since - as far as I know - firmware is coded 
today in VHDL, C or some assembler and the days of hexcoding are long gone.
