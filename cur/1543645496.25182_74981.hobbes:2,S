No.
OK I understand it now - if someone wants to put barrier support in an FCP
adapter driver something like we have in scsi_populate_tag_msg() would be
useful, an inline or macro like:
static inline int scsi_is_ordered(Scsi_Cmnd *SCpnt)
{
	if (SCpnt->request->flags & REQ_BARRIER)
		return 1;
	else
		return 0;
}
