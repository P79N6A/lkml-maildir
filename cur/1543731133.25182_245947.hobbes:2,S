 Ooohhhhh...I think that I know what is your problem:
Linux version 2.2.14-12smp (root@porky.devel.redhat.com) (gcc version 
egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)) #1 SMP Tue Apr 25 12:58:06 
EDT 2000
 Back in 2.2.x times, RAID was not autodetected (if I recall correctly). So 
your old Linux is unable to start the RAID.
 Get a miniKnoppix or some other simple modern rescue system (any 
RH/SuSE/Debian/... installation CD will do the trick), and boot with it. It 
would be the nicest way of recovering your data.
 Regards,
  Ender.
