Btw, while this won't oops the machine or anything like that, I consider
bugs like this where the kernel just silently does the wrong thing to be
potentially even more serious, since they cause endless head-scratching
and the "flaky" reports.
So if somebody can come up with a way to test this sanely, it would be
nice (thinking about it I suspect that you _should_ be able to trigger
this on x86 by using the old "int 0x80" syscalls together with setting TF
in eflags).
