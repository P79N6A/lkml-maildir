I wouldn't go so far as to say that Mr. Giampaolo misunderstood something,
just that it is possible to read an incorrect implication (which is hard
to judge, outside of context.) To the best of my knowledge, he is quite
correct that ext2 does not guarantee consistency of on-disk data. This is
quite beside the fact the buffer cache compensates for this. If the power
goes out (or someone mucks with the disk directly), you do very much care
whether the disk is consistent, and this is _not_ the same issue as write
caching. A file system can be designed (in cooperation with the write
cache) so that it always is in a consistent (if not necessarily ideal) 
state after each physical write. ext2 forgoes some of this, in favour of
speed.
And, yes, none of this is an issue in normal use. Files on any file system
should not "self destruct" for some esoteric reason. That is a bug, not a
design choice. But I very much doubt Mr. Giampaolo was trying to say that,
and I'm willing to give him the benefit of that doubt.

Again, to the best of my knowledge, this is not an inaccurate statement. 
ext2 was built on some of the techniques used in FFS, among others, and is
comparitively faster, with less consistency. 
All of this discussion aside, I'd like to question the idea that if an
author wishes to discuss the technical merits of ext2 or any other part of
Linux, this is a reason to _ignore_ them if they get it wrong? If you feel
someone has done a poor job, then a reasoned critique would be better for
all concerned.  Ignorance (or poor editing) is usually a correctable
problem, after all.
