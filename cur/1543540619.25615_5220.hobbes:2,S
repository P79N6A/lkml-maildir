Trouble is, those concessions are not Supreme Court decisions.  They could
be reversed with one stroke of a bureaucrat's pen.  (Remember that it's an
election year in the US.)  It has happened -- four years ago, US rules on
exporting satellite technology were reasonable, but not any more, not since
Congress decided they could embarrass the President over it.
If FreeS/WAN were to once start accepting US contributions, then making
its code base *verifiably*, *unquestionably* free of them again -- should
that become necessary -- would be extremely difficult.  It's an all but
irrevocable step, requiring considerable trust in a government that has
historically been openly hostile to free crypto.
