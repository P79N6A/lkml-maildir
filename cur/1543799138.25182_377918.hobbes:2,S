This is an interesting problem actually.
alsa consists of a number of different modules.
They all load in the correct order if they are modules. The problem 
comes when one compiles them into the kernel. They then load in the 
wrong order and bad things happen, resulting in the recommendation that 
alsa should always be modules.
In this basis, we should not have to change the code in alsa at all, but 
instead change the kernel to understand the load order, even if compiled 
into the kernel and not as modules.
I have no idea how to get the kernel to do this though. Any pointers?
