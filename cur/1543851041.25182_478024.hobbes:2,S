None at all, Richard is wrong on this point. You can happily reserve
memory starting at physical zero on an x86. In fact the x86 kernel
*already* does this because many BIOSes use the first page for BIOS data
and touch it when we use BIOS services or in SMM.
For a worked example of loading Linux under a small RTOS take a look at
RTLinux, which turns Linux into on task running on a tiny strict RT
kernel.
