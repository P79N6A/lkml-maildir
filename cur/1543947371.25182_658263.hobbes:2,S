I kept the calculation as it was before but the '- 3'
is not needed. So it could be fixed and the case N:
should then be updated.
[Thanks to Sergei to not this]
Another note: The warnings were seen with a
make CONFIG_DEBUG_SECTION_MISMATCH=y build so they most likely
does not show up duing a typical build due to the inlining performed
by gcc.
