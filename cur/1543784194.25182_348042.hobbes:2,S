I see several posabiltiys of how SPI devices could be
connected to an adapter.
1) All SPI devices are hardwired to the adapter. I
think this would be the most common. In this case you
would register a cs table as part of the platform data
of the SPI adapter like in the example platform in my
patch. Note: this is even the case with a PCI or usb
based device as it is the adapter that is hotpluged
and not the SPI devices on that device.
2) Some SPI devices are hardwired and some are
removable. In this case these the hardwired ones would
be put in the cs table and the other SPI devices would
be registered by calling spi_device_register. I would
add a call in my core layer to which you could pass
the bus_id and it would pass back the adapters pointer
to put in the spi_device structure.
3) All SPI devices are removable. An empty cs table
would be used and SPI devices would be registered by
calling spi_device_register.

Your not when you use spi_device_register /
spi_device_unregister. You can register an adapter
with an empty cs table if you don't have any hardwired
SPI devices. When you plug a card in you use
spi_device_register to add that device to the system
and when you remove the card you call
spi_device_unregister. You can then do the same for a
different card and at no time have you changed the
declaration of the controller.

OK. I will post an updated version of my SPI subsystem
within the next few days with the transfer stuff added
and maybe the interrupt and GPO abstraction as well.
I haven't seen any replies to my SPI patch :( did you
reply to it?
