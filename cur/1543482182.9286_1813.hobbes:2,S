Yes, I had the same problem, but haven't had time to track it further:
- isofs and SCSI cdrom as modules
- /etc/fstab has an entry for my cdrom, but it's marked "noauto"
- system hangs during "mount -av -t nonfs,noproc"
Using the debug options for devfs didn't reveal anything obvious
(but I can supply you with logs). The breaker seems to be "mount"
doing a readlink(/dev/sr/c0b0t5u0).
BTW Richard: Your sample modules.conf file should put
alias           /dev/fd         off
alias           /dev/stdin      off
alias           /dev/stdout     off
alias           /dev/stderr     off
_below_ 
alias           /dev/st*        st
alias           /dev/fd*        floppy
because modprobe scans the list from bottom to top (!) and 
hence will load the SCSI tape module when devfs asks for "dev/stdin"!
Actually, one could view this as a bug in modprobe or at least
unexpected behaviour.
Cheers, Roderich
