At this point I am only aware of one place in the kernel where timers and 
other BH code interact, that being deliver_to_old_ones() in net/core/dev.c.
Even there, it appears that the interaction is not with another BH but with
code that at one time was BH code.  As I understand it, BH and all of its
support stuff is being removed from the kernel.  That is why I was asked to
submit this patch.  So far, this is the only area that has come up as a 
locking or serialization problem.
As to this bit of code, it appears that changing it to do much the same as 
it did to the timer_bh to the new timer softirq should resolve the issue.
If you have additional input on this or other problems that need to be addressed,
I welcome it.
Correct me if I am wrong, but it looks like the network code has already left
the BH playing field.

Of course.  Why use high-res when you don't need it?  There is additional
overhead for high-res.  To require all timers to be high-res when only one
is needed is a waste.
