Me too. I can't imagine this. I studied more the german than the english language,
but I wouldn't dare send only one "Impact" line in german. It would be worst than my
english.

Of course. And thanks for these comments!

Thanks. Note that french people like me are silently cheating with the english language.
We have a lot of similar words and we can survive while mumbling english, even with only few
basis, but don't tell anyone, it's a secret ;-)
I applied your comments, see the patch below.
Thanks again.

Subject: [PATCH v3] tracing/ftrace: don't trace on early stage of secondary cpu boot
Impact: fix a crash/hard-reboot while enabling cpu on runtime
On some archs, the boot of a secondary cpu can have an early fragile state.
On x86-64, the pda is not initialized on the first stage of a cpu boot but
it is needed to get the cpu number and the current task pointer. This data
is needed during tracing. As they were dereferenced at this stage, we got a
crash while tracing a cpu being enabled at runtime.
Some other archs like ia64 can have such kind of issue too.
Changes on v2:
We dropped the previous solution of a per-arch called function to guess the current state
of a cpu. That could slow down the tracing.
This patch removes the -pg flag on arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common.c where
the low level cpu boot functions exist, on start_secondary() and a helper
function used at this stage.
Changes on v3:
Fix my evil english in the v2 (Thanks Steven).
