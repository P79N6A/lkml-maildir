I mean atomic in the either old or new sense.  I'm wondering what  
guarantees
the atomicity.  Not the C standard.  I can see the gcc compiler uses a MOV
instruction to load the atomic_t from memory which is guaranteed atomic by
the architecture if aligned properly.  But gcc does that for any old int
as far as I can see, so why use atomic_read?
