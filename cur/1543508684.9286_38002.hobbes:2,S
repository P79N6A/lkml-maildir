Pardon my gushing tone, but I've just been running the torture test
from hell for eight hours (so far) on my alpha seeing with no errors.
Load avg is constantly between 30 and 85, peaking at 100+ from time to
time.
Here's what I did:
continues kernel compiles of the 2.2.12 and 2.3.17 kernels in
parallell using make -j 8 MAKE="make -j 8", while doing a similar
compile of mozilla on my raid array at the same time
This machine does routing for me, so all the time this has been on
(OK, I stopped it after eight hours while leaving the compiles
running), I've been pinging machines that it has to route to.  While
the time is slowed a little by the intense load, it didn't lose a
single packet in all those eight hours.
Even under these loads, I am still able to log in, and interactive
performance is not too shoddy (beats the old Slowaris development
server I used to have to work on when its load was 4!)
This is all running under 2.2.12 kernel.  This improvement in
stability is a really remarkable achievement when you consider that
all the kernels between 2.2.5 and 2.2.12 have given me loads of random
segfaults etc.
Thanks to Alan Cox and rth for all their good work on this kernel.
