Sander,
	This is exactly what we want here. Once we have information on how to
access the device, we will be able to create all these nice features, that
for example, will help people that had your same problem. Imagine that just
because someone tripped over the cable, you will loose your HD, data,
backup, Music and so on. And the worst thing, your laptop has the feature,
but you can't use it. I was also looking into making the 3D show, but,
nothing can't be done until someone figures out, or IBM releases some specs.
	Thanks for adding yourself into the thread.
.Alejandro
