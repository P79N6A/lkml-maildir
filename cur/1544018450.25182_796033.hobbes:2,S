That's true for the pvops hooks emitted in the .S files, but not so true 
for ones in C code (well, there are no explicit push/pops, but the 
presence of the call may cause the compiler to generate them).
The .S hooks can definitely be cleaned up, but I don't think that's 
germane to Nick's observations that the mm code is showing slowdowns.
