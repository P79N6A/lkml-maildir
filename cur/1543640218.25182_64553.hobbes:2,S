Agreed; futexes are lovely because they are so generic.

Quite.  There is no lock; the the futex is used in its purest form, as
a wait queue.
      TID  = thread is alive
      zero = thread is gone
There's no "lock-counter format", because this isn't a lock -- it's a
wakeup.  There no need for atomicity either, because the listener only
reads, it doesn't write.  I'm not sure if a PROT_SEM word is required
for cache coherency, but if it is, your current implementation requires
one too.
Here's a synchronous thread_join-style waiter; it is architecture-neutral:
	while (tid = *tid_address) != 0)
		retval = sys_futex (tid_address, FUTEX_WAIT, tid, 0);
