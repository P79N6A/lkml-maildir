hi:
	I read the doc about romfs in the /linux-2.4.x/Document/, it said that there is a romfs mailing list.
	I search on the google with the keywords "romfs mailing list" and "mailing list romfs", but i haven't 
	find some direct link to romfs mailing list.
	Would you please tell me where is the romfs mailing list? And I have some question about linux romfs.
