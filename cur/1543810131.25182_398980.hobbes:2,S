Well, that is up to Nigel, but he did spend a lot of time to make
Suspend 2 clean and acceptable for the mainline first.
I do not complain that the patch is not inserted as it is. I too see
the problems and open issues. But that is nothing that cannot be solved.
What I complain is to start from the scratch with something which is not
necessarily better and takes a lot of time. I think uswsusp in the
current form just has too many drawbacks.
Regards,
Matthias
