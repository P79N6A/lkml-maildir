well, the root filesystem is an initrd, so I can't do that.
I suppose I could compile in the extra info for /proc/partitions and see
if that gives me anything I can keep looking for (don't know if it puts
file system labels in there, but that is probably what I would have to go
on since that is really the only thing that is constant on all systems).
Is there a quick/clean way to query a device and get the label?  I suppose
I could use tune2fs or something, but I didn't know if there is anything
better/simpler.  I don't know if I like the idea of running tune2fs on
each partition again and again.  I guess I could keep a list in memory and
only check each one once, but that is getting a bit more complicated &
time consuming.
