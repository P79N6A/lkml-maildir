There was a big ACPI merge in 2.5.7-pre2, but since the ACPI people
never tested the non-ACPI case, they had broken that horribly by some
bad assumptions they had made.
I fixed the non-ACPI brokenness, which then left the ACPI merge in a
halfway state..  So right now ACPI device initialization doesn't work. 
I'm hoping that the ACPI folks can fix up their broken assumptions soon.

Right now you need to run 2.5.7-pre2 without any ACPI support
whatsoever, I'm afraid.  I may try to fix it on my own, but I'm still
hoping some official ACPI person will beat me to it.
