Hi,
after trying around with my ancient bcm2033 bluetooth dongle i found it
not working in 2.6.24 - I debugged udev and found it loading the
firmware correctly but the device seems to have problems disconnecting.
I found an Ubuntu bug which mentions a patch which supposed to be
2.6.20 material. It still applies and fixes my problem:
Ubuntu Bug:
	
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/
+source/linux-source-2.6.20/+bug/85247
Patch:
	
http://launchpadlibrarian.net/7058766/bcm203x-2.6.20-backport.diff
So it seems this patch never went in but most likely should.
Flo
