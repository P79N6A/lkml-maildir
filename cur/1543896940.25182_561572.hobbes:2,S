Perhaps you should change your rude attitude towards people who are seeking 
for answers without actually looking for rants or flame-wars. If you have 
read my replies to Alan, you should know why I asked these questions.... To 
clarify something that might be incorrect or biased in the articles I've read 
so far... if you could tell me a better place to ask about Linux internal 
stuff, please tell me so...... 
As I'm not a kernel programmer I don't see the need to subscribe to the LKML, 
I can contribute nothing to it. Yes, I do follow the LKML by reading it 
(that's how I discovered the new CPU schedulers from Ingo and Con and gave 
them a try, great piece of software, by the way). Reading kernel "patch 
e-mails" doesn't really teach you who invented this stuff... there are 
probably a lot of technologies which I'm not aware of their inventors, hence 
the simple questions I asked to clarify it for myself...... but if you decide 
that it's trolling because I'm not part of your "kernel development team" and 
I don't contribute to it (maybe I don't have the skills?) then you are the 
one who keeps the biased or wrong articles out there live longer by not 
willing to answer or clarify some things to a person who's just looking for 
the *correct* answers
Thanks !!!
