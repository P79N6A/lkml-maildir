CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL=n (as set in your .config) should be the one setting 
that is important for performance - enabling it offers debug options, 
and some of them can significantly influence the performance.
Other options might influence the size and very slightly the speed of 
the kernel, but not in any noticable way (except when you disable a 
driver required for your hardware).
E.g. it even wouldn't matter if your kernel would be smaller by 1 MB and 
faster by 1%.
The best solution for users like you is to use a distribution kernel and 
the distribution autodetecting all hardware and automatically loading 
all drivers you might need.
