It doesn't seem likely that '\r' is going to be accepted into the general
kernel.  I personally don't think the issue affects enough *nix systems
for this to be a big issue.
I used to work at an ISP where I maintained a Slowaris box with about 600
websites on it; this issue came up frequently with customers uploading
scripts in binary mode trying to run #!/usr/bin/perl^M.  The solution for
me was to just do the following:
	cd /usr/bin
	sudo ln -s perl^V^M perl
and it effectively solved the issue.  I havn't looked at slowaris 8, but
slowaris 7 still refuses to run #!/usr/bin/perl^M.  Why not just use a
simple one-time solution that will solve the problem & is portable to
other OS's?
