   Is the only network issue?  Is it possible that the network code
   uses bh_locking to protect against timers?  Moveing timers to
   softirqs would invalidate this sort of protection.  Is this an
   issue?
It is the whole issue.  We have to stop all timers while we run the
non-SMP safe protocol code.
