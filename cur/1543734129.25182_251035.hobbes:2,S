My "personal plan" has been posted for comment to all relevant email
lists -- xorg, fbdev, dri, and lkml. All feedback that was received
was addressed and incorporated. Various aspects of the plan were
talked about at three OLS sessions. Everyone has been invited to
participate.  I even went through significant effort to encourage
fbdev developers to come to OLS and discuss the changes.
Plan as orginally posted to lkml:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/8/2/111
If the kernel community is going to reject this plan please let me
know now so that I won't waste a year of my life writing the code for
it. If Linux wants to stay with a 1980's desktop that's fine; at least
Microsoft and Apple are innovating.
