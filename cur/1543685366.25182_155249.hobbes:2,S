Changing read-ahead doesn't work. Neither to 8 nor to 512.
I think it doesn't have something to do with read-ahead,
because the system-performance-drop occurs while
writing to the disk.
My dd-example wrote to disk:
dd if=/dev/zero of=./t.test
I just ran a few other tests:
dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/null
doesn't drop system performance and the system is very usable
while dd is running.
So reading from a plain partition is OK.
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdc7
This slows down the system _very_ much, but it's still usable.
The mouse curser doesn't jump randomly over the screen, like it
did while
dd if=/dev/zero of=./t.test
So my guess, it may have something to do with reiserFS.
So I ran another test:
I did
mke2fs /dev/hdc7
mount /dev/hdc7 /mnt/data_1
cd /mnt/data_1
dd if=/dev/zero of=./t.test
And now the surprise. :)
Here the system-behaviour is exactly the same, as while
writing to the plain partition.
The cursor is not smooth, but it's usable and it doesn't
jump ramdonly over the screen.
So I think it has something to do with reiserFS.
Where can I start to track it down, why reiserFS
is doing this?
Hmm, I'll try to enable
CONFIG_REISERFS_CHECK
and
CONFIG_REISERFS_PROC_INFO
Can somebody tell me how to debug reiserFS with these
options enabled?

Short note: hda and hdc are both exactly the same devices.
