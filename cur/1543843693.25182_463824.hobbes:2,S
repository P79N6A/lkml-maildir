Actually, the problem is ohci_hcd doesn't seem to recognize devices plugged
into the USB ports.
For example, if I unplug and replug a mouse (that worked before unplugging),
it doesn't work any more.  I have to reload ohci_hcd to make it work again.
This is 100% reproducible and occurs on the two boxes above.
Appended in a snippet from a dmesg output that I think is relevant to this
issue.  It covers the unplugging and replugging of a USB mouse (there are no
more USB-related messages in the dmesg).
Greetings,
Rafael
