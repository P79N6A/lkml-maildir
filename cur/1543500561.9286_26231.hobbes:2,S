Hi,
  Machine is K6 200 MHz, 128 MB, motherboard Asus TX-97E. I have two
disks on the primary IDE interface plus a rack and ZIP drive on the
second one.
  What I'd like is that the rack (hdc) allow hot swapping of disk, but
it doesn't work, no matter the kernel. I can umount, remove the rack,
put another disk in but then if I do a fdisk -l /dev/hdc it just hangs
solid. Whether the ZIP is plugged or not doesn't make any difference.
I cannot afford to compile IDE as a module, so is there any solution? I
was thinking about two things:
* are there any plans to split IDE interfaces initialization, ie
separate configuration of first, second, etc. interfaces? If there were,
would it solve my problem? If no, why?
* will devfs solve the problem?
