Hi,
  I got a little problem with 2.2.5, after about 2-3 days the machine uses
about 50-60 MB memory after doing a telinit 1. (allready excluded
cache+buffer mem)
I had the problem, that the machine did hang after a couple of days, with an
out of memory
error. I did not change any of the userspace programs, so i suggest its the
kernel.
Unfortunately my knowledge of the kernel is not that good. How can I know,
how much memory
the kernel uses, and wich part of it ?
My first idea was the i4l code, but I did a rmmod <i4l modules>, start i4l
again, but
nothing changes.
the machine is a dual p233, tyan tomcat mainboard, running plain smp 2.2.5
with current
i4l patched. (and compiled as module)
I did compile the kernel with egcs1.0.3, can that be the problem ?
