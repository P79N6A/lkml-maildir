Ok, I did that. The number are stable and reproducible. In fact, the 
average for SLUB is within 1 KB of the previous numbers. So, we have the 
same .config, the same userspace, and the same hypervisor, so what's the 
difference here?
We probably don't have the same version of GCC which perhaps affects 
memory layout (struct sizes) and thus allocation patterns? I have included 
ver_linux from my laptop here:
