I think that he's using a debian kernel and thinks he's using a vanilla
kernel while it's not. I've just installed one on an ultra5 and discovered
a directory with about 60 patches, one of which was dedicated to the removal
of this "undesired closed-source tg3 firmware" ! I was happy not having lost
time debugging this on a machine with a tg3 NIC.
I find it a bit odd when distro makers don't clearly put their name in their
kernels, because it confuses people who honnestly think it's a vanilla one.
Indeed, I'm yet not really sure what they put in the kernel that booted my
sparc, but it's not a problem now since I've replaced it ;-)
Cheers,
Willy
