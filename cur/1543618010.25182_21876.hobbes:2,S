If they use writepage(), then the job of balancing cache cleaning is 
done, we just use
writepage as their pressuring mechanism.  Any FS that wants to optimize 
cleaning
can implement a VFS method, and any FS that wants to optimize freeing 
can implement a VFS method,
and all others can use their generic VM current mechanisms.
