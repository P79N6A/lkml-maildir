In fact, the new PCI suspend/restore code should have made that 
unnecessary, since the PCI layer now makes sure that a save/restore is 
done even if the driver hadn't done it.
But at the same time, still having the driver do it certainly shouldn't 
have _hurt_ anything either. But it's quite possible that the tg3 thing is 
very sensitive to the exact order things happen in - there's a lot of 
comments about bugs in there ;)

That seems to imply that even the reset failed, which is interesting. 
But it also possibly means that the problem is not necessarily the driver 
itself, but some cached state that we keep around in "struct pci_dev" even 
across a module load/unload. 
For example, if we get the "dev->current_state" cache wrong, then we may 
not actually end up changing it when we should, because we think we 
already match the target state. I don't _think_ that is it, but that's the 
kind of thing that could happen.
Can you do a
	lspci -vvxxx -s [tg3-device]
before-and-after suspend? Is there some state that looks like it got 
corrupted?
