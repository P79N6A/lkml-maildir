True, and this is the argument I face(d) with a lot of the msleep()
changes I made. I guess I would like a comment for this case, where
we're using wait_event_interruptible(), but actually are ignoring the
signals that might make us return early.

I see that now, thanks.

You're right again -- sorry for the noise, I must have been reading it
wrong. Rewriting it as !(kthread_should_stop() &&
list_empty(&hub_event_list)) helped me :)
Thanks!
