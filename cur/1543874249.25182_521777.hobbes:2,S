The one-percent-granularity problem also applies to /proc/sys/vm/*dirty*
and possibly other things.  So any fix we do should be applicable to those
as well.
And I'm not really sure how we should do this.  I do think that we should
change the kernel so these knobs are internally higher-resolution.  So, for
example, we switch all the logic so that instead of these variables
representing 1/100th, they instead represent 1/1000000th, for example.
Then, we change the top-level /proc handler to do the 1/100th <-> 1/1000000th
conversion.  So the rest of the kernel doesn't have to know about it.
The we duplicate all the relevant /proc knobs:
cat /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio
30
cat /proc/sys/vm/hires-dirty_ratio/
300000
Or we do something else ;)
