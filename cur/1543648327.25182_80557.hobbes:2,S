Just in case anybody feels bored, maybe someone wants to come up with a
include/asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.S (or a better name) which has the common 
part of all the arch's vmlinux.lds.S - so we could make such changes like
you're proposing at one place in the future.
Since all vmlinux.lds.S get preprocessed by the C preprocessor, putting
an "#include <asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.S>" in there should be easy enough 
instead of all the current duplication.
