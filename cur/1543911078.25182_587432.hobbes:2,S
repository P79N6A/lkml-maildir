Subject: TV card detected wrongly by the kernel. Any chance to get this fixed?

Hello,
I have a BT878 based TV card (was sold by a german discounter some years 
ago).
Unfortunately this card gets detected wrongly and so I'm unable to watch 
tv, if I allow the kernel to auto-detect the card.
If I unload the module and reload it using the right "card=" value, then 
anything works well. So one of the first steps, I do if I install a new 
version of my distribution, is to place the "unload module and reload 
with the right value" code to my "rc.local" file.
Is there any chance to get this card added to the kernel, so the right 
value gets auto-loaded?
Thanks in advance
Yours
Manuel Reimer
