Good news: This isn't the bug Greg was worried about.
Bad news: Something is seriously strange here.  Note the following from the
logs:
Nov 14 06:07:43 lara [   41.890614] usb-storage: Bulk Status S 0x53425355 T 0xd R 0 Stat 0x0
Nov 14 06:07:43 lara [   41.890616] usb-storage: -- unexpectedly short transfer
Note the 'R' value of zero -- this is the residue value.  It indicates a
complete transfer, and that matches the log lines immediately previous
which indicate a 4K transfer which completed properly.
If residue is zero, then srb->resid should be zero.  Take a look in
linux/usb/storage/transport.c in usb_stor_Bulk_transport()
If srb->resid is zero, then you should NEVER get the "unexpectedly short
transfer" message.  Look at usb_stor_invoke_transport() in the same file.
In fact, every transfer I look at shows this error.  I didn't exhaustivly
check every single one in the log, but a quick scan suggests that they all
are bogus; good transfer, CSW residue of 0, and "unexpectedly short"
message.
Maybe I'm too tired at this hour, but I just don't see how this is
possible.  Then again, I'm looking at 2.6.22 codebase (it's what I have
handy).
Hrm... does this tree have the "srb accessor" patches in it?  I'm wondering
if somewhere the init srb->resid to 0 before invoking the transport got
lost....
Matt
