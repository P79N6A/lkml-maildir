I'm working on it right now.  This code is really gross and needs
to be fixed immediately.
What I'll do is define a "struct tcf_common" and have the generic
interfaces take that as well as a "struct tcf_hashinfo *" parameter to
deal with the individual hash tables.
We define all of this templated stuff then don't even use it in
act_police.c, we just duplicate everything!
Absolutely unbelievable.
