To replicate an IRIX idea:
We could have section with variables that can only be modified by special 
command. F.e.
enable_write_to_most_read_section()
<change variable>
disable_write_to_most_read_section()
This section could be a per cpu section that would be replicated
to all nodes on the system on disable_write_to_most_read_section().
That would mean that critical read only data would be node local.
