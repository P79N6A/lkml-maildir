"ruled"? Isn't that the job of courts (and of course not of the
executive part of a government)?
And yes, there is another interpretation possible - justice is no longer
separated from the executive part.
And it is the job of the USPTO to grant patents and not to hinder them.

There are lots of patents in the USPTO.
Have fun removing everything which is claimed by some granted patent.
It boils down or `rm -rf world`.
