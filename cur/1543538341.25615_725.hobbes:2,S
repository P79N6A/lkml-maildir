This isn't how our current implementation works.  Originally, we used a
disk-based system that wrote the dump to a swap partition.
Currently we're using an in-memory system that saves the dump in a
compressed form to memory, reboots the system (using bootimg on Intel), and
writes it to disk on boot via a init script.
This system is working well -- the only issues we're having is with SMP and
video on Intel.
