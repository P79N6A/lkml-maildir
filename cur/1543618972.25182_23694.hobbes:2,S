The CoW markings are done at the same level they always have been - directly
in the ptes (the 4 byte thingies, please don't get confused by the unfortunate
overloading of 'pte' to mean 'page table' in some contexts, e.g.,
zap_pte_range).  But the CoW marking only has to be done for page tables
that have use count == 1 at the time of fork.  So if the parent inherited
some page tables then these already have use count > 1, i.e., are shared,
and they don't have to be set up for CoW again when the child forks.  Only
page tables that the parent instantiated for itself have to be re-marked
for CoW.
Wow, this is getting subtle, isn't it?

True.  Also, since the child is doing all that work anyway, the cost of
instantiating one page table (and extending the pte_chains) per 1K
referenced pages will get lost in the noise.
