Bill:
As I have been running through the kernel setting:
2.6.11/sound/pci/ac97/ac97_patch.c:
static const snd_kcontrol_new_t snd_ac97_ad1981x_jack_sense[] = {
     AC97_SINGLE("Headphone Jack Sense", AC97_AD_JACK_SPDIF, 11, 1, 1),
Note the last "1" is originally "0" in the kernel.  This might do it, but 
the issue for me remains that the line-detect for line-out should turn off 
the internal speakers (as it previously has).  Instead I have line-out 
working and internal speakers going.  And, yes, the headphones still work. 
All of this with 'headphone jack sense' enabled.
If you're not using line-out (out of a docking station) the above may work 
for you.  I tested plugging my speakers from the docking station into the 
headphone jack and the interal speakers did cut off as expected.
