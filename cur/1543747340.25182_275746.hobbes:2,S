It can't break userland either.

Wrong. They'll _still_ have to maintain duplicates, since they can't rely
ont he end-user to have a recent enough kernel.
It's just that they can hopefully start _copying_ their dupliates more 
easily. But if you think the duplication goes away, then I don't want you 
to send me patches, because you don't understand the issues.
At RH you may see only the case where people do a whole-system upgrade. 
Please realize that that is just _one_ schenario, and you should not 
assume that it's the only valid one.
