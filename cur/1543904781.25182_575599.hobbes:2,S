So, does this explain why I wouldn't have a problem at 115200 bps with 
kernel 2.2.5 but why I do with 2.6.5 and 2.6.18?  Both hardware and 
software flow control work fine with 2.2.5 (meaning I don't see any 
error message and I don't have any data corruption), but neither works 
to avoid the "kernel: ttyS1: 1 input overrun(s)" and consequent data 
corruption issue in 2.6.5 nor 2.6.18.
Was there some associated application change in tty handling that needed 
to occur between the 2.2 and 2.6 kernels to properly implement flow control?
Thanks,
Lee.
