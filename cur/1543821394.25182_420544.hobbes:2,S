Since I use the buffers with size TMP_SIZE also for other purposes
in the same functions, where the cpu types are accessed,
I think, it is not useful to define a second buffer with size 17.
But I think it is better to have a define for the buffer size
of cpu names. something like:
 #define LPAR_NAME_LEN 8                /* lpar name len in diag 204 data
*/
+#define CPU_NAME_LEN 16                /* type name len of a cpu in
diag224 name table */
 #define TMP_SIZE 64            /* size of temporary buffers */
 static int diag224_idx2name(int index, char *name)
 {
-       memcpy(name, diag224_cpu_names + ((index + 1) * 16), 16);
-       name[16] = 0;
+       memcpy(name, diag224_cpu_names + ((index + 1) * CPU_NAME_LEN),
+               CPU_NAME_LEN);
+       name[CPU_NAME_LEN] = 0;
        strstrip(name);
        return 0;
 }
