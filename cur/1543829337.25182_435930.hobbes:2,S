Should be _only_ interfaces; everything else descends from an interface.
There was previously an invariant that the interfaces were marked
as quiescent unless the interface (a) had a driver, and (b) that
driver was not suspended.  Evidently that has been lost.  This patch
may be insufficient; ISTR other places relying on that invariant.
And yes, we _should_ care about whether or not any interface is
still active, until the pm core code starts to pay attention to
the driver model tree at all times ... even outside of system-wide
suspend transitions.  Today, the pm core code doesn't even use
that tree directly, and all runtime state changes (like selective
suspend with USB) completely bypass that pm tree.
