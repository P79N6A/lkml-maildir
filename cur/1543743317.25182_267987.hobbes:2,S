Ugh, there are just too many pm patches flying around.  Sorry, but yes,
I did ack this patch, but I did so to let Pat take it.  He's the one
collecting all of these changes.
Also, due to the fact that we are all still discussing (well, I'm
listening at least) how this is all going to work on the linux-pm
mailing list, I think it's quite early to be getting patches like these
into the tree right now.
So, in short, Andrew, don't apply it.  Let Pat collect them, and then
I'll channel them in through the proper paths.
thanks,
