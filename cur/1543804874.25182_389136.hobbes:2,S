I hate to say it...but in my experience, this has been exactly the case 
with soft updates and FreeBSD 4 up to 4.11 pre releases.
Whenever something untoward would happen, the filesystem almost always lost 
files and/or data, usually just files though.  In practice it's never 
really worked too well for me.  It also still requires a full fsck on boot, 
which means long boot times for recovery on large filesystems.
