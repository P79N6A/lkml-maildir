When I said cached into registers I meant cached this way:
	read into eax
	inc eax
	wait 1 year while doing other stuff
	write eax into memory before return
And the above would be fine as well in the do_timer case.

The above is perfect for a volatile variable IMHO. Also incl (without lock
on the bus) is not atomic in SMP.
