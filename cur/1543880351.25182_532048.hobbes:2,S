Perhaps -- until your httpd is compromised via a buffer overflow or 
simply misbehaves due to a software or configuration flaw, then the 
assumptions being made about its use of pathnames and their security 
properties are out the window.
Without security labeling of the objects being accessed, you can't protect 
against software flaws, which has been a pretty fundamental and widely 
understood requirement in general computing for at least a decade.
