kernel-god,
Thanks.  However, I have checked that, during bootup, the IRQ 10 is only used 
by the IDE card (HPT370 chipset). (note, I have the onboard IDE attahced with a 
hard disk holding Linux).
Would it be related to the driver which tried to treat my hard disk as DMA ones 
instead of PIO?
Thanks.
