I will have to get back to you about rdtsc.

There is a boundary condition that can have non-global pages containing
the CR3 load to also hit this issue on affected PIII.  Though for this
to happen, mov to cr3 has to be the very last instruction on a page.
And the page following that page (containing CR3 load) has to have
different mapping between user and kernel spaces.

Interruptions will ensure that stale mapping don't exist in ITLB fill
buffer.  So, you are okay with double CR3 laods.
