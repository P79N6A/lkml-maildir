OK, you're right.  We'll continue working on the fork (namely ext3) and
when people who care consider those features stable enough they can port
them to ext2. :-)
Like another person pointed out - there are bugs that are fixed in ext3
that aren't in fixed ext2, and vice versa.  Even though the ext2 code
is basically dead, new bugs are still found in it.
Cheers, Andreas
