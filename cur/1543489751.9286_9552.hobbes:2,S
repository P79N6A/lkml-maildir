Hmmm... Wasn't this discussed recently here, with the conclusion that
having the stack grow up doesn't help much from buffer overruns?
In order for a buffer overrun attack to work when the stack grows up,
you just have to scribble into a buffer of one of the calling
routines.  This, however, is fairly common since most actual overruns
occur in libc routines like gets() or read().  The return address that 
you overwrite is from the library routine, not the user routine, which 
probably makes things easier for the attacker since library routines
tend to be simpler and less likely to get tripped up by overwriting
something else.
Am I missing something here?
