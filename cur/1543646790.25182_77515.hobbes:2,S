Sorry again for above typo - it makes my whole statement worthless..
To clarify: I think not having device nodes for anything but the uppermost
layer of evms volumes is a bad idea.  This does not only make it impossible
to access those normally from userspace but also makes evms duplicate
code in the block layers as we already have stacking support there.
