Yeah, that's not it.
It _seems_ to be triggered by this:
	Bluetooth: HCI device and connection manager initialized
	Bluetooth: HCI socket layer initialized
	usb 5-1: USB disconnect, address 2
	usb 5-1: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 4
	usb 5-1: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
	Bluetooth: HCI USB driver ver 2.9
	usbcore: registered new driver hci_usb

I'm actually using modules for the "don't care" things, like bluetooth. 
But yeah, UHCI/EHCI are compiled-in.

Will try.
Sadly, grub is buggered on this machine (it's the mac mini) and I can't 
switch kernels around easily, so when a kernel fails to boot, I have to go 
into the rescue-CD thing etc. That makes it a bit painful.
But I've got netconsole to capture the logs, at least ;)
