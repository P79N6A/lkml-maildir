The current quirk_amd_8131_ioapic() function sets a global
pci_msi_quirk flag, which disables MSI/MSI-X for all devices in the
system.  This is safe but suboptimal, because there may be devices on
other buses not related to the AMD 8131 bridge, for which MSI would
work fine.  As an example, see the end of this email for a lspci -t
from a real Opteron system that has PCI-X buses coming from an AMD
8131 and PCI Express buses coming from an Nforce4 bridge -- MSI works
fine for the Mellanox InfiniBand adapter on the PCIe bus, if we allow
it to be enabled.
I guess what we really should be doing is setting the dev->no_msi flag
for all devices below the AMD 8131 PCI-X bridge rather than turning
off MSI globally.  Of course this is somewhat tricky, since a device
could be hotplugged onto a bus below the AMD 8131.  Greg, any thoughts
about the proper way to use the driver model infrastructure to handle
this?
The other place that pci_msi_quirk is set is quirk_svw_msi().  I don't
know why MSI is turned off for that Serverworks chipset, but perhaps
the same change could be made, and the global pci_msi_quirk flag
killed off entirely.
Thanks,
  Roland
