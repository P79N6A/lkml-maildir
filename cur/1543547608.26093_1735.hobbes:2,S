Hmm. Doesn't the spec say something about that you should preferrably
use the "closest" IP number that you can find to communicate with a
host?
Yes, adding a route to "a.b.c.1 gw d.e.f.1" on the BSD box should
work.
But having a multi-homed host with a.b.c.1 on one side and d.e.f.1 on
the other, then I'd expecit it to use d.e.f.1 to communicate with
d.e.f.2, even if both are physically on the same ethernet.
