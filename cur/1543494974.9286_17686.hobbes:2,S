After upgrading to 2.2.7-ac2 some of my CDs don't
mount correctly anymore (most work, but my beloved
auto-booting RH6 doesn't :P). Actually, they do get
mounted, and df shows their total capacity, but no
files show up. This happens on both IDE & SCSI CD
drives which leads me to believe it's a proble with
isofs.
Downgrading to ac1 solves the problem.
