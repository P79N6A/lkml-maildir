Good idea, let's put stuff like this in hardware-dependent includes, and
just have a single line in the core code  like
  check_special_pfault_cases;
and that documents what is happening as well as avoiding reading around
it. It seems silly to leave a big hunk of code in when developers are
making efforts to drop cruft and keep Linux practical for embedded
systems.
People were willing to drop the whole prefetch feature, I don't see that
micro ifdefs are a bad thing, it's just that thought needs to go into
making the code readable.
