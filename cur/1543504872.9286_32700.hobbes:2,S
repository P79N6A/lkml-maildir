Hello,
I'm setuping a system without keyboard, but with VGA in. I don't want to
just login from /dev/ttyS0, because the display will be outputed to
/dev/ttyS0 too.
Could I using a serial input device to substitue keyboard, just like a
terminal without display, for example, press Alt-Fn will change to the
vitual terminal n, press Shift-Pgup to scroll back.
I read file in linux/drivers/char for several days, I still don't know how
/dev/tty1-63 connected to /dev/tty ( I thought it's the base keyboard, is
it? ). And I know I should write a new serial driver, and disable the whole
keyboard. After reading lines of source code, I'm been confused, so I
determined to get help.
Thanks.
