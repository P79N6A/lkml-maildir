With a risk of sounding rude, but do you have ANY idea of what you're
doing?
What's missing is the "endmenu" that is supposed to pair each
mainmenu_option, nothing else. Oh, and you don't expect a bool to work
without a variable to hold that bool-value, now do you?
But as I suspect that the author didn't really intend all those sections
to become separate submenus (which they will become if you just add those
"endmenu"-tags, I'm doing a little rewrite of this Config.in file myself.
There are lots of things wrong with it. For instance, the author(s?) seem
to have overlooked Documentation/CodingStyle completely...
Oh bother...
