I'm a little stumped trying to set up raid 10. I set
it up and it worked but after a reboot it forgets my
raid setup.
Created 2 raid 1 arrays in md0 and md1 and that works
and survives a reboot.
However - I created a raid 0 on /dev/md2 made up of
/dev/md0 and /dev/md1 and it worked but it forgets it
after I reboot. The device /dev/md2 fails to survive a
reboot.
Created the /etc/mdadm.conf file but that doesn't seem
to have made a difference.
What am I missing? Thanks in advance.
