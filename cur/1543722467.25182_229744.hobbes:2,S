And here's what I said to Jeremy over IRC as well...
I think it's perfectly reasonable to want a "driver -> registered 
devices" mapping.  That's what the installer appears to want, if I 
understand Jeremy correctly.
That will probably take some thought by the sysfs wizards, though, since 
drivers are registered on a per-bus basis...
