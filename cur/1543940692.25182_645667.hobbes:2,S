The preempt off code shares the irq off code. With irq off only (before
this patch) all that was needed was to check if trace_enabled is set or
not. Now that the preempt off code is coupled with the irqs off code, we
may hit some paths where tracing is enabled but we are not currently
tracing. This variable was added to facilitate this knowledge.

It was more of an internal design change than a feature.
