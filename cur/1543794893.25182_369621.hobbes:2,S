None of the desktop Windows installations I'm aware of exhibit this. The 
recent versions of Windows are fairly stable.

Nobody uses this option (well my father does, but he's in technical 
computing. I was unable to convince him to move to Linux).
Most people have stable, easy to use Windows desktops. I don't like to 
admit it, but I had to fight to get my via video to work correctly.

Many people have hyperthreaded CPUs today.

I sincerly doubt Linux ships with more drivers than Windows. And when 
you compare driver availability (shipped or vendor provided) the gap is 
very wide.

It works well on the server, where Linux has a large and rising market 
share. It doesn't work on the home desktop where Linux is nonexistent. 
There are also intellectual propery issues involved in video which 
prevent open drivers.
So, your Winmodem, most people's 3D cards, many wireless adapters, and 
all the esoteric devices are not supported (it is nice to see the 
situation improving with wireless, though). The lack of drivers is one 
of the blocks towards expansion on the home desktop, and vice versa.
Perhaps Windows drivers can allow enlarging the desktop market share, 
after which they will not be needed because the vendors will see the 
light and provide open, and presumably better drivers.
