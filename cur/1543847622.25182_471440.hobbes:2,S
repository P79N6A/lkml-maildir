Debian is currently in (pre-) freeze mode, and new upstream versions of
core packages are uploaded very very carefully. To see whats going on
with the wireless-tools package, see [1, 2].
[3] shows that 29pre10 was uploaded to experimental on Thu,  4 May 2006
So you are right, debian unstable doesn't ship the latest version,
because that would have the potential to make problems with the release
of debian 4.0 (aka etch). The updated package however is there. If this
package should go to etch, because 2.6.18 is likely to be the kernel
etch ships, then both the maintainer and the release team needs to be
convinced about that.
