There are solid technical reasons (a) why libata drivers include scsi.h, 
and (b) why all libata drivers look similar.  It -impedes- maintenance 
to have one libata driver different from all the others, and this is 
what you are suggesting.
Your suggestion causes nothing but additional work, for zero gain:  as I 
have explained, all the scsi.h includes will go away at the same time. 
Such as sweep would catch all libata drivers, including sata_mv.
Until you're willing to step up and help with 2.4.x maintenance, you're 
just being an impediment for non-technical reasons.  If you want to do 
that, join politics and become a politician.  I have real work to do.
