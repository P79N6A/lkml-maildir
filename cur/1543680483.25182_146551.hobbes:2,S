  Hot swap is really only in the second SATA spec.  Also hotswap is 
generally only support on scsi devices, usb devices, and raid controllers.

  You used to be able to hot swap with sca scsi drives doing the following:
1)Echo some wierd command to /proc/scsi/scsi to remove the device.
2)Physically swap drives
3)Echo some wierd command to /proc/scsi/scsi to add the device.
See scsi.c 3rd, and 4th instances of the word "echo" for details.
  Of course a number of scsi raid controllers support of replacing of 
failed drives, and automagic rebuild on the new drive.  This requires a 
saf-te backplane, and a saf-te compatible raid controller. 
  In theroy you can do this on a 3ware pata, and sata controller with 
the 7.6 firmware, the 7.6 cli, and ide hotswap backplane.  Personally 
I've never tried it with a jbod drive.

  If might be possible if you had a controller that supported the 2nd 
sata spec, a hot swap drive carrier and used the ata-scsi driver.  Then 
the same echo trick for scsi might work.  More likely bad things would 
occur.
