Yeah, I'm OK with something along those lines, too.  I'd prefer sticking
some stubs in a header and putting the #ifdef there, if only for
aesthetic reasons.

I really wish we'd stop calling it "page online". :)
Let me think out loud for a sec here.  Here's how memory hotplug works
in a nutshell:
First step (add_memory() or probe time):
1. get more memory made available
2. create kva mapping for that memory (for lowmem)
3. allocate 'struct pages'
Second step, 'echo 1 > .../memoryXXX/online' time:
4. modify zone/pgdat spans (make the VM account for the memory)
5. Initialize the 'struct page'
6. free the memory into the buddy allocator
You can't do (2) because Xen doesn't allow mappings to be created until
real backing is there.  You've already done this, right?
You don't want to do (6) either, because there is no mapping for the
page and it isn't committed in hardware, yet, so you don't want someone
grabbing it *out* of the buddy allocator and using it.
Your solution is to take those first 1-5 steps, and had the balloon
driver call them directly.  The online_page() modifications are because
5/6 are a bit intertwined right now.  Are we on the same page so far?
Why don't we just free the page back into the balloon driver?  Take the
existing steps 1-5, use them as they stand today, and just chop of step
6 for Xen.  It'd save a bunch of this code churn and also stop us from
proliferating any kind of per-config section-online behavior like you're
asking about above.
That might also be generalizable to anyone else that wants the "fresh
meat" newly-hotplugged memory.  Large page users might be other
consumers here.

Do tell. :)
