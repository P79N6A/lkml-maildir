Would anybody mind if I pick this up for linux1394-2.6.git's master
branch? --- This would mean it appears in the next -mm.
(Personally, I would prefer it being stuffed into drivers/ieee1394, thus
preparing for a _potential_ point in time when the kernel config option
of old stack vs. new stack vs. both stacks condenses to a radio button
in a single IEEE 1394 config menu, and for a potential brief period
during which both stacks live in mainline together that way. But if
nobody else complains, I'll include it as drivers/firewire.)
