Check the source ;). There is a proc-fs entry which relates to the 
source port range setting. Over this entry point you get in case of TCP 
sockets to ../net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c:tcp_v4_get_port(...). For UDP sockets 
you need to peek into ../net/ipv4/udp.c:udp_v4_get_port().

Not likely, but reading the source should help. You can set the local 
port range via /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range. It's documented.
HTH and best regards,
