How do we recurse?  printk never calls the suspend method.
What *might* happen is that printk might call the serial console write
function, which waits a maximum of 10ms per character to be sent without
hardware console flow control, or one second per character with hardware
console flow control.
This will only happen when there isn't something asserting CTS connected
to the console port and hardware console flow control has been configured
at boot time.
This will also happen in normal operation if you set the system up as
above and deassert CTS - there's nothing suspend specific about that.
Finally note that hardware console flow control is entirely separate from
the user-level flow control settings or the hardware's ability.
