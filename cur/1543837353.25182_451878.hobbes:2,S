Greetings;
The old fart is back again. :)
I've just done a divide and conquer on kernel versions, and have found that 
while I DO have a kde audio signon for kernels 2.6.18-rc1-rc3-rc4, I do 
not have any other functioning audio, including the kde sound effects I 
normally get.  xmms and tvtime are mute, as are the firefox plugins to 
play videos from the network. 2.6.17.8 and below works great yet.
So whats the fix?

Cheers, Gene
People having trouble with vz bouncing email to me should add the word
'online' between the 'verizon', and the dot which bypasses vz's
stupid bounce rules.  I do use spamassassin too. :-)
