Subject: [RFC] Patch to fix cdrom being confused on using kdump
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi Jens
As we had discussed earlier, I had seen the cdrom drive appearing
confused on using kdump on certain x86_64 systems. During the booting 
up of the second kernel, the following message would keep flooding
the console, and the booting would not proceed any further.
hda: cdrom_pc_intr: The drive appears confused (ireason = 0x01)
In this patch, whenever we are hitting a confused state in the interrupt
handler with the DRQ set, we clear the DSC bit of the status register and 
return 'ide_stopped' from the interrupt handler. 
Please provide your comments and feedback.
Thanks
Rachita
