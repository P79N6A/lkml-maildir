David's right. The delay accounting field cpu_count
is measuring how many delay values are recorded in the field cpu_delay_total
(so that one can divide one by the other to get an average if needed).
For the delays reported for a single task (ie. __delayacct_add_tsk called only
once for a given task), the effect will be what Martin wants i.e. cpu_count will be
the same as /proc/pid/schedstat's third field (sched_info->pcnt)
But when the delays are reported for a tgid, where *accumalation* of delays for
all constituent pids is being done (by calling __delayacct_add_tsk repeatedly), what
is desired is to accumalate both cpu_count and cpu_delay_total.
So the patch proposed by Martin is incorrect.
