People keep on doing
	printk("%llu", some_u64);
testing it only on x86_64 and this generates a warning storm on
powerpc, sparc64, etc.  Because they use `long', not `long long'.
And not just a little bit - this bug gets repeated maybe ten times per
week - it's insane.
If we make all architectures use `long long' then the above code
becomes correct and warning-free on all architectures.
And we then get to remove all the open-coded (unsigned long long) casts
which we added all over the tree (hundreds of them).

Yes, quite a few 64-bit architectures are using `long' for their
s64/u64 types.  We should convert them all to `long long'.
That's quite trivial to do, but it causes a lot of warnings due to code
in arch-speciic files which does
	printk("%lu", some_u64);
which will then generate a warning.  Or an error if the archtiecture
uses -Werror, which several do.  So we need to simultaneously convert
all those to %llu.  (Or %Lu, which saves a byte :))
