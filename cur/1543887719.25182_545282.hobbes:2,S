Subject: [PATCH] libata: implement ata_wait_after_reset()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/16/279

On certain device/controller combination, 0xff status is asserted
after reset and doesn't get cleared during 150ms post-reset wait.  As
0xff status is interpreted as no device (for good reasons), this can
lead to misdetection on such cases.
This patch implements ata_wait_after_reset() which replaces the 150ms
sleep and waits upto ATA_TMOUT_FF_WAIT if status is 0xff.
ATA_TMOUT_FF_WAIT is currently 800ms which is enough for
HHD424020F7SV00 to get detected but not enough for Quantum GoVault
drive which is known to take upto 2s.
Without parallel probing, spending 2s on 0xff port would incur too
much delay on ata_piix's which use 0xff to indicate empty port and
doesn't have SCR register, so GoVault needs to wait till parallel
probing.

This patch is against the current libata-dev#upstream +

Paul, please verify this fixes your problem.  You can skip the
pata_scc patch, it will cause pata_scc part to be rejected but doesn't
matter.
Jeff, added 800ms delay is sad but this seems to be the only way to
avoid iVDR drive detection regression for 2.6.22.  I'll cook up
parallel probing for 2.6.23.
Thanks.
