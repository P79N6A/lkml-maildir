True.

This is from mcelog 0.3, dumped with a daily cron job to 
/var/log/mcelog.  I think it came from 2.6.11-gentoo-r6 (which should be 
essentially 2.6.11.7).
The machine is Athlon 64 3200+ (754), on an MSI K8T Neo-FIS2R, running a 
moderately old BIOS but one that has erratum #93 (or whatever it was) fixed.
Anything I should attach to provide more info?
I just upgraded to mcelog-0.4, but at this rate I don't expect a new 
dump for awhile.
Thanks,
Andy
