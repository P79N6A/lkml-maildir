Actually I have 2nd thoughts about it.  Clients should have a general
way to know that a device went away.  (I.e. distinguish I/O errors from
mere stale generation from I/O errors due to the node being gone for
good.)  I will check tomorrow if the ABI does this distinction already.
If yes, we don't need the patch.  (But might still need improvements in
libraw1394 or/and clients to fail fast when appropriate.)
