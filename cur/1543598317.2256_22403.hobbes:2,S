I think you are just wrong - nobody really needs this patch. /dev/random
or /dev/urandom ar *both* anyway just complete overkill in terms of 
practical security. /dev/urandom is in esp silly, since it is providing
a md5 hash
implementation inside the kernel, which could be *compleatly* and
entierly
done inside user land.

Wrong. Don't let you confuse yourself by the way the term entropy is
used in
the documentation of /dev/random - it's an abuse of the mathematical
definition anyway. The more appriopriate term there
would be: signal source variability estimate.

You mean - there is no known algorithm with polynomial time
behaviour enabling us to calculate the next value of this function
from the previous ones - Not more nor less - no pysics and
entropy involved. If you assume this holds true it's mathematically
entierly sufficient that a single only seed value is not known.
