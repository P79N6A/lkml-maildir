It's almost time for a FAQ.
For RH 6.1 which uses glibc-2.1.2 you need to take the following steps:
1) modify the kernel headers glibc uses (separately installed on RH6.1)
	linux/include/linux/limits.h: change NGROUPS_MAX
	linux/include/asm-i386/param.h: change NGROUPS accordingly
2) recompile glibc
3) install/upgrade it.
When you have users in >16 groups working on an NFS client this will
break: the RPC protocol passes only the first 16 groups to the server. I've various
NFS client side patches to eliminate this problem (2.2.x, 2.4.0-test*, see
also 
http://www.inter.nl.net/users/fvm/nfs-ngroups
)
I've set NGROUPS_MAX to 256, no problems.
