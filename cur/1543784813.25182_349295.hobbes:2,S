yeah, there was a long discussion about it. see:
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=112275164900002&r=1&w=4
the reason being that it breaks APM suspend on Hugh Dickins' (added to cc:) laptop.
Linus was quite clear about why reverting...

we should look at both problems in detail:
- with APM it seems to break because the bridge gives interrupt before the
  handler is installed.
- with ACPI i think some _other_ device gives the interrupts too early. but
  when all devices on the interrupt unregister the irq is disabled and the
  problem is hidden.
i don't think we can do mutch about the APM case...
so Rafael, your /proc/interrupts, lspci -vvv and dmesg, please.
