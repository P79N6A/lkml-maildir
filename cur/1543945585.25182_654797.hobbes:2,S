Yes that should work ... it's uncommon, but not illegal.  Some
controller drivers may even handle that right!
If the delay were zero and cs_change didn't indicate a need to
briefly deselect the chip, it might make sense to reject such
a NOP transfer.  But that's not the case you identify.

For future reference ... could you identify a few such devices,
and say what "long" is relative to the clock period?
Some folk have just slowed down the clock in such cases, but
that's rather sub-optimal.

Feel free to submit patches fixing those bugs.

I'd like to avoid new parameters to cover case that can already
be expressed in the programming interface.  Cases that can't be
expressed ... different issue.  I suspect any patches updating
timing parameters should use nanoseconds not microseconds, fwiw.
