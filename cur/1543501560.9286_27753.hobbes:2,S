I can't seem to get Linux to recognize long filenames on
CD-ROMs. They always show up in their 8-char representation
(eg. "techno~1").

/dev/hdc        /mnt/cdrom                iso9660	ro,noauto,user 0   0
</.fstab>
I have also tried the various iso9660 mount-options - to no avail.
It's working right on Windows 9x. I can't find anything I might have
done wrong...
Kernel: 2.2.10

Confidence is the feeling you have before you understand the
