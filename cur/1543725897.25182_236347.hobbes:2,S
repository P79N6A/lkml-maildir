For drives smaller than 128GiB the "48-bit Address feature set" is optional,
hence many older drives do not support it (since the old 28-bit LBA
addressing is suffient).
With 28-bit addressing the number sectors which can be transferred
in one request is limited to 256. Linux 2.4 limited this further
to 128 (i.e. 64KiB). With 48-bit addressing up to 2^16 sectors
could be transferred in one request, but Linux 2.6 puts an arbitrarily
chosen limit of 1024KiB on it.
'hdparm -I /dev/hda' will tell you whether your drive supports
48-bit addressing:
  Commands/features:
	Enabled	Supported:
	   *	48-bit Address feature set 
For full details see the ATA/ATAPI-7 spec at
