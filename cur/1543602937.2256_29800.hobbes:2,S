Subject: compilation error with 2.4.10 (gcc 3.1)

Hallo,
I have tried to compile official kernel 2.4.10 with gcc 3.1 from CVS and
get the following error:
ld -m elf_i386 -T /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/vmlinux.lds -e stext
[...]
init/main.o: In function `check_fpu':
init/main.o(.text.init+0x51): undefined reference to `__buggy_fxsr_alignment'
I'm aware that this might possibly related to the "too" new gcc version.
Due to lack of knowledge about c programming, I cannot have a look to
solve it myself.
Any solution or help would be deeply appreciated.
Thanks for reading,
Axel
