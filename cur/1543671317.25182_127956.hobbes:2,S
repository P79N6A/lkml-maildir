Yes, you win. This looks good, both as code and as op-codes on
Intel...
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int i;
    int mask = 0x40;
    for(i=0; i< 0x1000; i++)
        printf("%08x\n", !!(i & mask));
}
You need to actually change something, hense the for() loop. Otherwise
gcc just optimizes everything to a 1!
