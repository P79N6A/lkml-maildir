This is what I have - but anyway, the apm=off option seems to work for
the 2.4.19 kernel, so I guess i'll leave it at that for the time being.
I suspect that the option will work with the distribution kernel as
well.
If the task of poke'ing an additional IRQ into the APM monitor list is
simply just doing a pokeb or pokew at the right port somewhere, then I
just might have a look at it... I really don't know where to start
tough.
Anyway, thanks alot :-) at least now i'm pretty sure what's causing my
problems, and happy that i did NOT go out after another ATA133
controller, just to try that out - the result would likely have been the
same and a lot of money would have been wasted.
Thanks again
Thomas
