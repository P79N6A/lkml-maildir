this is exactly why the patch series I sent started with 64Kb. In fedora
we use 2Mb actually, and I know of some cornercases where that gives
issues (and the solution is a bit tricky). 64Kb is a nice safe start,
and it means the implementation can be quite simple. Later on, once this
patch has been proven solid and not to break stuff, adding a patch to
bring it up to 2Mb or so (I don't think more makes much sense, but I'm
open to debates about the ideal size for this, it's a tunable) that
needs to deal with stack rlimits < 2Mb and such can be done as a
separate step. Which then will in itself be quite simple again.
