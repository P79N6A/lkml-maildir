Veering off at something of a tangent - how much of this should be true 
for wireless devices? Softmac seems to be unhappy about setting the 
essid unless the card is up, which breaks various assumptions...
Beyond that, I think your descriptions of up and down states make sense 
for userspace. As Arjan suggests, there's then the intermediate state of 
"disable as much as possible while still providing scanning and link 
detection".

I'd have some concerns over how that would interact with the rest of the 
PM infrastructure, but it certainly sounds good in principle.
