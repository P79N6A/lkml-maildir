The kernel doesn't created these messages -- presumably
they're from acpid or some other user-level daemon
that is monitoring /proc/acpi/event.  Unlikely that
logging these events is necessary...
Event 0x80 on the battery device is a "Battery Status Changed"
which you'd expect to see when plugging/charging/discharging
a battery.  How frequent they are depends on the rate,
the battery and the firmware that is talking to it.
Is there a GUI or something reading the battery status files?
Do these events stop when running in text mode?
Did this not happen on this box with earlier kernels?
Do the /proc/acpi/battery* files look sane --
is the status really changing?
thanks,
-Len
