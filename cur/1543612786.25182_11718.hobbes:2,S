Hi,
  The embryo of an implementation of BSD credentials for Linux
2.5.1-pre5 is now ready in the form of a patch on
  
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/bsdcred/linux-2.5.1-pre6_cred.dif
So far there are no changes to the VFS API or even to the SunRPC
code: I'm just concentrating on setting up the basic interface for
sharing credentials between the task_structs and the struct file.
The size of the patch is already pretty nasty & long, but most of it
is just mechanical substitution of current->(|e|u|fs)[ug]id with
appropriate wrappers, and can be ignored. The real meat lies in the 2
new files kernel/cred.c and include/linux/cred.h...
Would interested parties (Al are you listening?) please take a look? 
I'd really appreciate any comments...
Cheers,
   Trond
PS: There is also a file linux-2.4.16-cred.dif in the same directory
that contains the same patch against bog-standard linux-2.4.16...
