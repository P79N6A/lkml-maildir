Locking.  Otherwise, why would the code look like that in the first place?

Compounded if-else vs. flattened if () with common error path is pretty
much matter of being accustomed to.  I prefer the latter because it
scales better (less nesting and less need for extra intelligence as
error case grows).  As I'm already used to it, it's also easier on my
eyes.  So, unless you have more to offer, I'm not really sure whether
the patch improves the situation noticeably.
