I stand corrected.  I should have been clearer making this statement.  I
did not see a mechanism for mounting a tmpfs in do_mounts.c, or main.c. 
One question:  I see that superrescue execs init and the end of
linuxrc.  Does this cause the kernel initialization to yield in
handle_initrd(), until init exits (reboot/shutdown)?
