Hmm. Ok. I'll think about it. Roughly 1/3 of the driver code will be 
duplicated if we go this route with the existing structure. I'll try to 
make use of a few helper inline functions which are smaller and can be 
ifdef'ed without much code duplication.

It's an issue of maintainer convenience vs. esthetics. And (last but not 
least) it's also about other people's ability to easily make changes to 
the driver, changes they can understand and test. So while in principle I 
agree with you, I'm also beginning to understand Donald Becker's 
frustration when others remove backward compatibility from his code.
So let's try to find some middle ground, ok? Your first suggestion sounds 
reasonable, and hopefully the fate of the zerocopy stuff will be decided 
sooner than later.
Stay tuned, there should be another version coming your way sometime 
today...
Thanks,
Ion
