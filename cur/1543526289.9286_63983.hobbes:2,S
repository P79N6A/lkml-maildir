Greetings,
  I am getting my feet wet with kernel modifications.  
  I decided to modify the keyboard.c driver to add Volume_Up, Volume_Down
handlers (similiar to Incr_Console, Decr_Console).
  I modified loadkeys to allow it to hook into my new keyboard.c handlers.
(The Windows Left, Windows Right and Menu keys are being used.)
  I know that the handlers are working, I am logging messages to the
/var/log/messages whenever the keys are pressed.
  THE QUESTION:
  I don't believe the mixer is initialized, I can't do an open("/dev/mixer")
from within the kernel.  How do I program the mixer from kernel space?
(Using ioctls?)  Any direction would be greatly appreciated.
I am not subscribed to the kernel mailing list.
