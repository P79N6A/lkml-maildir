No, this is needed.  You can only bind a device to a driver that will
accept it.  As we can not add new device ids to all drivers yet (only
PCI supports that), this isn't as useful as it could be.  I'll be moving
that PCI code into the driver core, so that all busses that want to
support this (adding new device ids on the fly), can.

Examples of such?  Yes, a bus that isn't really expecting this to
happen, as it has some odd locking logic in the
registering/unregistering of a new driver for it, might have issues.
But I'd say that this is the bus's fault, not the driver core's fault.
Becides, you can just have the bus fail such a bind/unbind attempt, if
you really want to do that.
Anyway, I've tested this with PCI and USB devices, and they both work
just fine, and those are the busses that the majority of people want
this functionality for.

Overloading a single file would be messier.  The overhead for an
additional attribute per driver is quite small (I move the unbind
attribute to the driver, as it makes more sense there as Pat mentioned.)
