Greetings,
I've recently had several very solid lockups of my 2.3.5 SMP kernel 
(compiled with egcs-2.91.66).
The typical situation involves these steps
 - First cause a lot of activity on an aha2940 connected hard disk with 
   ext2fs filesystems. Typicallly a `tar cvf - xxx | gzip > yyy' on a 
   +-40MB large directory tree seems to do the trick.
 - Then access a vfat filesystem on an Iomega ZIP disk connected to an
   Iomega aha152x clone. Most of the time I was trying to copy the file
   created during the first step, but once I got no further than a `df'.
 - It seems that I can make it happen right after booting and logging 
   into X.
The symptoms:
 - First and foremost, a very solid lockup. Nothing in the logs. (Hmm, 
   well, on one occasion my logs got nuked so I couldn't check)
 - On 5 out of 6 occasions, the last visible thing to happen was the
   appearance of a small 1.5cm by 1.5cm white square containing what 
   looks like a text cursor at some seemingly random position on the 
   screen. It looks a bit like a borderless window, but probably isn't.
Final remark: I've occasionally had similar problems when accessing the
ZIP drive in the past (partly many months ago) and reported some of them 
here. So the problem may not be new. Oh yeah: back in those days I did
not use egcs, but good old 2.7.2.
More system info is available on demand if interested.
      MCE
PS: I'm staying away from the 2.3.[789] stuff because I need VFAT to 
    work and currently only have backups that suit the really brave :-).
