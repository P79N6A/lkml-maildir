That got audio working, mpg123 and xmms played erm, stuff :) , but I
opened kmix with xmms playing something and xmms continued playing, but
with no sound, and I had to rmmod es1371 and ac97_codec and then
modprobe sound again to get sound back.  Opening kmix twice in a row
made the master volume go red like there was no sound card.  There
weren't any error messages that I could locate.  Is this related, or do
I need something other than es1371 and 
ac97_codec modules installed? (I'm compiling with CONFIG_SOUND=y and
CONFIG_SOUND_ES1371=m)
I'm thinking mixer code problems, but then again the only C I know is
how to comment stuff... :)
If it helps, the sound is onboard and is a 1373 (SB PCI64D) IIRC.  
Thanks a lot.
