Yes, but we already have cancel_work_sync().

There is a reason even if no rearming. We have a lot of
	cancel_delayed_work();
	flush_workqueue();
This should be converted to use cancel_delayed_work_sync().
Note also that both cancel_work_sync() and cancel_rearming_delayed_work()
can be used on any work (rearming or not) and both imply "flush".
I think the "_rearming" part of the name is very confusing, and a "good"
name should be consistent with cancel_work_sync() and cancel_delayed_work()
which we already have.
