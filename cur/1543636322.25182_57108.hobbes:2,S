   The Gang scheduling function has the func-     
   tion of simultaneously allocating the required  
   number of CPUs when scheduling parallel             
   programs, and allows you to obtain almost  
   the same performance when multiple parallel  
   programs are simultaneously executing, as if  
   the programs were running alone.              
I have approximately zero interest in this myself, but something seemed
off about the definition of gang scheduling being used in the post.
Cheers,
Bill
