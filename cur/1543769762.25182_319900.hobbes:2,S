I was refering to the 2.6 permissions bug in cdrecord. It wouldn't work using 
a non-root user, even if they had the correct permissions. 2.6 changed (for 
the better, mind you), and Joerg refused to fix cdrecord. (I don't know if 
its even fixed now). Theres been other cases of cdrecord breaking on Linux 
only, but I can't think of them atm.

I really wish someone would build a replacement for cdrecord, but Joerg just 
hasn't pissed off that potential author enough.
