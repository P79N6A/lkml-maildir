	SCSI devices are addressed on a bus with ID + LUN, where ID
	is numeric prioritized thing, and LUN is "Logical UNit" inside
	the device.
	Some devices don't check what LUN value is used when probing
	existence of said device / its features and appear at all LUNs.
	Some other devices *must* have it working, like when LUN
	addresses individual disks at a multi-CD-changer/player, for
	example.
	It may also be that if LUN is non-zero, some devices simply
	hang the SCSI bus.
	Blacklists are something which are used to avoid known bad
	hardware from causing problems for otherwise nice working
	autoprobing of (SCSI) busses.
