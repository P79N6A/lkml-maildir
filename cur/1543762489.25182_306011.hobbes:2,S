I bet your PAM nonaware daemons started at boot are not affected by
those settings. The point is that if you gain access through a non-root
daemon started from boot scripts, you are no longer limited
by /etc/security/limits.conf.
Try to set hard nproc limits for user UID and run this from your boot
script:
#define UID 65534
#define MAX 65535
int pids[MAX];
int main() {
        int count = 0; pid_t pid;
        if (setuid(UID) < 0) { perror("setuid"); exit(1); }
        while ((pid = fork()) >= 0 && count < MAX) {
                if (pid == 0) { sleep(300); exit(); }
                pids[count++] = pid;
        }
        printf("Forked %i new processes\n", count);
        while (count--) kill(pids[count], SIGTERM);
}
You will see that even if user UID is limited
in /etc/security/limits.conf it will be able to fork many more
processes.

I agree on this one. Or the RLIMIT_NPROC should be set to a lower value
by default.
