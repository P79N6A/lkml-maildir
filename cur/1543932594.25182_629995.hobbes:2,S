thanks, applied to x86.git. Nice and elegant patch!
Btw., since the TLB flush state machine is really subtle and fragile, 
could you try to run the following mmap stresstest i wrote some time 
ago:
   
http://redhat.com/~mingo/threaded-mmap-stresstest/
for a couple of hours. It runs nr_cpus threads which then do a "random 
crazy mix" of mappings/unmappings/remappings of a 800 MB memory window. 
The more sockets/cores, the crazier the TLB races get ;-)
