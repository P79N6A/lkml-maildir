No, he really meant without.  I don't know if Valdis saw the presentation 
that went with that draft, but I did (last IETF in Yokohama).  The example 
was a 10Gbps link with a 250ms RTT (plausibly, a trans-pacific cable 
lambda).  There are tens of thousands of 9k packets in the window (yep, 100 
*megabytes* in flight in the cable!), and it does take several hours with 
exactly zero drops to get the connection to fill the 10Gbps.  After one 
dropped packet, it can take an hour to get back to full utilisation.  The 
graphs are really startling to look at :-)
That quirk just meant the numbers were off by a few orders of magnitude.
If anyone wants to look at that further, I think there are URLs in the 
draft.  If not, I can dig them out of the proceedings.
