Jens, just to bring your definition of regressions to its logical 
conclusion: does this mean that if there is any longstanding bug in the 
block layer that you know about, but i didnt ever utilize that bit of 
the block layer it in my .config, and if i enable it now in the .config 
and i experience that bug, does it suddenly count as a regression? Do 
you realize that your definition for "regressions" turns _almost every_ 
current bug in the kernel into a regression?
