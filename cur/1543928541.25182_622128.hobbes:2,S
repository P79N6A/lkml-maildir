Just to clarify - you're OK with the *concept* (a security model that determines
whether you can do an I/O based on the content), it's just their code that's
ugly?
(Note that the concept has interesting implications in the other direction as
well - rather than stopping you from reading a file that has malware, you could
in theory write an anti-export package that would let you write onto external
memory or outbound e-mail, but prevent the write if it was corporate-sensitive
data, or whatever.  Yes, I *know* a smart attacker can bypass it by simply
crypting/compressing it first - but the vast majority of attackers aren't
smart, and will just use 'cp' or the GUI equivalent to move the secret design
documents onto the USB key... )
