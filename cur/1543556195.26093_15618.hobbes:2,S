Subject: [RFC] Configuring synchronous interfaces in Linux

Hello,
For synchronous network interfaces, besides configuring network parameters
such as IP address, netmask, MTU, etc., the system should also configure
parameters specific to these sync i/f's, such as media (e.g V.35, X.21,
T1, E1), clock (internal or external, and value if int.), protocol (e.g
PPP, HDLC, Frame Relay), etc.
What I noticed was that each synchronous board in Linux provides a
different way of doing this, and it would be good for users to have a
single, standard interface (such as ifconfig) to do this type of
configuration. Maybe even patch ifconfig itself, I don't know ...
Questions:
- Is there any existing _standard_ interface to do that??
- If not, is there any existing _standard_ infrastructure (e.g. ioctls and
  structures) so that I can write an application to do that over this 
  standard structure?
- If not, where would be the right place in the kernel to change in order 
  to implement such infrastructure?
I'm interested in implementing this, but I don't want to reinvent the
wheel (if such wheel exists ...).
Thanks in advance for your comments.
Later,
Ivan
