Indeed, that's why I waited until everything else was fully merged and
accepted.

Here:
+/* fs segment starts at (positive) offset == __per_cpu_offset[cpu] */
+#define __percpu_seg "%%fs:"
+#else  /* !SMP */
+#include <asm-generic/percpu.h>
+#define __percpu_seg ""
+#endif /* SMP */
That's how we get SMP & non-SMP unification in that code.

No, but I'll run them this evening.  Last time the size reduction was
slight, and there was no measurable performance improvement in
microbenchmarks.
Thanks,
Rusty.
