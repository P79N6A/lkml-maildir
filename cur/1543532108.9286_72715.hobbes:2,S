in this case, TSC is completely and utterly useless to user-space.
there are only three sensible alternatives:
    - TSC's are incoherent and TSC's are turned off in user-space.
    - TSC's can be relied upon, and the kernel syncs them.
    - the kernel saves/restores TSC contents as necessary to make 
    user-space see coherent time.  ouch!
the sanity of SMP with different clocks is ambiguously in any case:
the MPS standard says that OS's should merely try to function,
but doesn't mandate any particular or sensible user-space behavior.
