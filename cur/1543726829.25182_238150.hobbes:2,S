What should be the model for reorganizing DRM? An obvious change is
eliminate the naming macros. 
Another is to change to a personality with helper library model like
fbdev has. All of the common DRM code would go into a library module.
Each card would then have a small device specific module which depends
on the library module for common code. 
ian: what about splitting the current memory management code into a
module that can be swapped for your new version?
Are other structure changes needed?
