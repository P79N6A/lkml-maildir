Aside, can you just enlighten me as to how TLB misses are improved on 
x86-64? As far as
I knew, it doesn't have ASIDs so I wouldn't have thought it could share 
TLBs anyway...
But I'm not up to scratch with modern implementations.

Of course if it was free performance then we'd want it. The downsides 
are that it
is a significant complexity for a pretty small (3%) performance gain for 
your apparent
target workload, which is pretty uncommon among all Linux users.
Ignoring the complexity, it is still not free. Sharing data across 
processes adds to
synchronisation overhead and hurts scalability. Some of these page fault 
scalability
scenarios have shown to be important enough that we have introduced 
complexity _there_.
And it seems customers running "out-of-the-box" settings really want to 
start using
hugepages if they're interested in getting the most performance 
possible, no?
