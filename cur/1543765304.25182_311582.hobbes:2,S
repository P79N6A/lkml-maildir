Arkadiusz Miskiewicz reported that this breaks compilation under PPC.
Apparently, PPC builds a bootloader that links against lib.a but doesn't 
expect any dependencies on slab. Since kstrdup calls kmalloc, this 
breaks compilation.
I can fix this by moving kstrdup into slab.c. This way this is treated 
as an "allocation" function instead of a string function, so it makes 
some sense to do this.
Andrew, do you prefer an incremental patch against the current tree, or 
a single clean patch against the current tree with all the current 
kstrdup patches taken out?
