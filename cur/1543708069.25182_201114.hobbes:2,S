Hi All,
We have developed a PCI device driver which works well on both MAC (yellow dog) and x86 (RedHat) architectures. 
Now we need to provide the support for SMP machine. What generic changes will have to be made to the driver to get it working on a SMP machine.
My first doubt is who takes care of the SMP support? Is it the kernel's job or the driver's job? 
As you can see I am not a guru at Linux device drivers, so I would be happy if you could provide me pointers or some good explanation on it.
Thanks a lot!
