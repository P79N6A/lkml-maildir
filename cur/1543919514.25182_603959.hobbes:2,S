Inline patches are preferred so that reviewers can comment on them
more easily.
What mail client are you using?
The patch has trailing CRs on each line ("DOS mode").
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Just verifying:  this TPM device has interrupts per locality?
+	/* check if interrupt is meant for this locality */
+	if (check_locality(chip, locality) < 0)
+		return IRQ_NONE;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
init_tis() still seems to have some problems.
 static int __init init_tis(void)
 {
+#define DEVNAME_SIZE 10
+
 	int rc;
 
+	if ((locality < 0) || (locality > 4))
+		return PTR_ERR(pdev);
pdev hasn't been set (so it's NULL).
+		pdev = platform_device_register_simple(devname, -1, NULL, 0);
+		if (IS_ERR(pdev))
 			return PTR_ERR(pdev);
Error path above needs to call driver_unregister().
