Hi all,
Ten days ago, Robert T. Johnson repported two bugs in 2.4's
drivers/i2c/i2c-dev.c. It also applies to i2c CVS (out of kernel), which
is intended to become 2.4's soon. Being a member of the LM Sensors dev
team, I took a look at the repport. My knowledge is somewhat limited but
I'll do my best to help (unless Greg wants to handle it alone? ;-)).
For the user/kernel bug, I'm not sure I understand how copy_from_user is
supposed to work. If I understand what the proposed patch does, it
simply allocates a second buffer, copy_from_user to that buffer instead
of to the original one, and then copies from that second buffer to the
original one (kernel to kernel). I just don't see how different it is
from what the current code does, as far as user/kernel issues are
concerned. I must be missing something obvious, can someone please bring
me some light?
For the mem leak bug, it's clearly there. I admit the proposed patch
fixes it, but I think there is a better way to fix it. Compare what the
proposed patch does:

 			    	res = -EFAULT;

 			}
 		}
Contrary to the proposed fix, my fix does not slow down the non-faulty
cases. I also believe it will increase the code size by fewer bytes than
the proposed fix (not verified though).
So, what about it?
PS: I really would like to see Frodo Looijaard's address replaced with
the LM Sensors mailing list address <sensors@stimpy.netroedge.com> as
the main I2C contact in MAINTAINERS. Simon Vogl and Frodo Looijaard's
have been doing a really great job, but they do not work actively on I2C
anymore, so they end up forwarding every repport to the list anyway.
