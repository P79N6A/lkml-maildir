When you say it was "clean when mounted 1 week ago" does this mean that you
had run e2fsck on it at that time, or just that it did not report any
errors when you mounted it?  Sometimes it is possible to have corruption
in your fs for a while without noticing it if you don't run fsck on it.

This is a problem with the ext2 code that I have a fix for.  It is not
the _real_ cause of your problem, since this is already showing that
there was another error which caused this problem.
The issue that I have a fix for is that if there is a corrupt inode
somewhere, and you delete it, then it will happily mark metadata blocks
as unused, and as you can see it will also proceed to allocate that
block for something else.
My patch fixes both of these errors - if you try to free such a metadata
block, it will not clear it in the bitmap, and if you try to allocate a
"free" metadata block free in the bitmap it will mark it in use, but
continue to look for a different block which can be allocated.
This change has implications for ext2/ext3 forward/backward compatibility,
but it is much more robust in the face of any errors in an inodes block
list, which could cause cascading errors if you proceed to scribble over
the itable or free blocks list.  I'm CCing the ext2-devel list on this for
discussion, but it should strongly be considered for inclusion into the
official 2.4/2.5 ext2/ext3 code.
Cheers, Andreas
PS - as always, this patch is extracted from among other changes in my
     ext2 code, so it may apply with offsets or minor context issues.
