Hi!
Sorry, I picked up this discussion a bit late...

format/compatiblity/parsing/performance

IMHO the only serious point against /proc in the discussion sysctl() vs.
/proc
was the formatting issue (performance set aside). 
I think this is a very serious point and could be circumvented by
introducing 
alternative *binary* file formats. For instance:
meminfo would be paralleled by a binary file meminfo.b and a struct
proc_meminfo 
{...} in <linux/proc_fmts.h>. Then there would be no problem with parsing
anymore.
And the advantage to be able to access the meminfo information in readable
form
via the VFS would be retained.
The compatibility problem is also a non-issue if the get_*() functions are
changed synchronously with the corresponding struct in proc_fmts.h as all
the applications are available in source code :-). Aren't they?
