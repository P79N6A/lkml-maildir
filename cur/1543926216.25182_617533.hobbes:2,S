That's a rediculious argument.
One other reason these bugs are resolved, is that the networking
developers only need to subscribe to netdev and not have to listen to
all the noise on lkml.
People who want to manage bugs know what list to look on and
contact about problems.
Dumping even more crap on lkml is not the answer.
