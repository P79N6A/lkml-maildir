Hi,
 Assume we have a process running, not all the pages of the process
are in main memory. Some are swapped, and some are just not loaded
yet.
How does the kernel locate those pages on disk? Is there a pointer in
the page table? or is there some place else? Any pointers to source
code in the kernel would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you very much.
