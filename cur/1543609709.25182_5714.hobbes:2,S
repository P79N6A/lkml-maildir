So for 99.9% of all cases my program will do much much more work than is
actually needed.
I may still save the data in a database, or go over the network with it,
so I should implement 1024 bit signed integers in all of that code too ?
And what happens when we do crypto and 1024 bits is not enough ?
I think the "use rediculously large datatypes" solution is a poor one,
as it can never cover all cases in the future, and it will impose a large
overhead on existing and new applications.
