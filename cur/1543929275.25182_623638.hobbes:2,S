Yeah, I doubt the 2.6.23 scheduler will be usable for distros though...

Sure, but do you whether _real_ java server applications are OK? Is it
possible to reduce the aggressiveness of yield to a mid-way? Are the
firefox tests also like dbench (ie. were they done with make -j huge or
some other insane scheduler loads)

I don't care about keeping the behaviour for future apps. But for older
code out there, it is very important to still work well.
I was just talking about the default because I didn't know the reason
for the way it was set -- now that I do, we should talk about trying to
improve the actual code so we don't need 2 defaults.
