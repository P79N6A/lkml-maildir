Roland,
as you already stated we really have a problem that we're not able to send
"large" pieces of code to the kernel mailing list.
It's perfectly ok for us to send patches to the openib.org mailing list and
svn.
This is something we still try to resolve with legal.
So thank you Roland for acting as a proxy here...
We have the ok to contribute to any ehca related discussion on kernel
mailing-list and ppc64-mailing list, and are absolutely willing to do so!
Adding a new driver for a complex new hardware isn't the regular linux
develpment case, especially if there's no base code in linux kernel to
patch against...
In our case this patch resulted in 22 postings.
Some people already noticed that there's still quite some road ahead of
us... but we're abolutely willing to work that, and we had to start at some
place.
Some coments will result in modifications to all files.
I guess posting 22 new patch files (diff against NIL) each week is sort of
a DoS attack on the mailing list and we'll end up in peoples spam folders
pretty quickly...
So what's the recomended way to proceed here?
Gruss / Regards . . . Christoph Raisch
