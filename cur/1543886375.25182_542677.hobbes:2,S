Subject: [PATCH] MMC: Flush mmc workqueue late in the boot sequence
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

At some point before 2.6.20, the mmc subsystem moved the card
detection code to its own workqueue. One consequence of this change
is that when using an mmc card as a root device, the card may get
detected after the init task attempts to mount the root filesystem,
causing a kernel panic because the root device could not be opened.
This patch adds a call to mmc_flush_scheduled_work() late in the boot
sequence so that we can be sure the mmc card detection scans are
complete before attempting to use an mmc device as a root device.
