Subject: [PATCH] More pmac-zilog sleep fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

In the long story of "BenH can't get a simple fix right the first time",
please add this one to pmac_zilog, and now people should enjoy really
working sleep again on pmac laptops ...
If the serial port was closed, we could use an uninitialized "pwr_delay"
and pass that to schedule_timeout().
