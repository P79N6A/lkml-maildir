More details?

I removed it because you pointed out that it usually caused
trouble on Intel systems: we would always detect errors due to measurement errors
and then make things worse by trying to fix it.
But you're right it might have been better to keep 
a check with a threshold to catch totally broken cases.

The only sure way would be to trap+printk -- but from previous
user complaints it's a substantial number.

I doubt the majority checks any cpu features first ...

Well I hope it's not making it HZ resolution. As noted earlier we tried
that already and it didn't work (it violates the "forward monotonity"
that is commonly expected) 
Ok I could imagine it making sense as a new CLOCK_FASTBUTLOUSYRESOLUTION timer in 
clock_gettime() [together with the new vdso fastpath], but not as default.
