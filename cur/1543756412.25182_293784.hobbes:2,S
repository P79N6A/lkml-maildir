[An Intel exec] said, basically, that customers are "wed" to the Windows
desktop.  What he didn't say is that hardware suppliers are wed to Microsoft as
well. And as long as the rest of the world depends on that marriage, there won't
be any room for innovation on the desktop, except by equally proprietary
alternatives such as those from Apple.   --Doc Searls' Suit Watch, Dec. 8, 2004
