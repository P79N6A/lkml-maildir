Depends how you define approximation, margins. I dropped them and
calculated reiser4 needs the most CPU time. Hans wrote it's worked on.
However guessing performance on a whatever carefully chosen loaded system
from results on an unloaded system is exactly that, guess, not fact.

I've never wrote I made my guesses from the CPU percentage alone, you
explained correctly why. I encourage you too to calculate yourself how
much more CPU time reiser4 needs.
