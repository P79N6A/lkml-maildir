Get the iproute2 utility from ftp.inr.ac.ru:/ip-routing, and check the state
of the neighbour entry on failure with "ip neigh".
Play with the timeout parameters of the ARP state machine (
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/core/<interface>/*) - especially base_reachable_time, 
delay_first_probe_time, gc_stale_time. The sysctls are documented
in arp(7) in manpages-1.25+.
