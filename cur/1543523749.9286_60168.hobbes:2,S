I too am trying to become familiar with the way the kernel works / is going,
which is the main reason I read the kernel digest. I'd say that your
suggestion would be greatly helpful to me, though I'd probably still read
kernel-digest. I don't know how much weight my opinion carries (not being a
kernel hacker or even much of a programmer, but here it is :)

The software designer can improve the design and architecture of the system
so that the system does not suck. Yea, even to the point that it rocks.
