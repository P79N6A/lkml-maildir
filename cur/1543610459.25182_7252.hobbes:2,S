Oh, I have to look at your configure.in for how you do that so I can add 
the opposite check to linux-ntfs and refuse to compile if gcc-2.96 or 3.x 
is NOT used. (-:

I don't know about that. All I can say is that since RedHat 7.0 and the 
updated gcc-2.96 (the first release was indeed broken) I have been using 
gcc-2.96 for everything and I haven't experienced any problems with it 
(compiling both kernels and user space code with it but YMMV as I don't 
compile that much user space code myself except for my own code which 
obviously works considering I write it for gcc-2.96...). I even installed 
gcc-2.96 on my SuSE 7.2 system and that has been happy with it, too.
