Those message are cause by the system running out of memory. I've see
MythTV make the system run out of memory on non-RT kernels (must be a
memory leak someplace). So I wouldn't think it related to any real time
changes.

The kernel will kill some running user space tasks to free memory. But
the kernel should be fine after that.
