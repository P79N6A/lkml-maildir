Subject: [patch] datafab fix and unusual devices
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

datafab.c has an often-seen bug: the SCSI READ_CAPACITY command
does not need the number of sectors but the last sector.
I just tried the CF and SM parts of a 5-in-1 card reader.
The CF part works with US_PR_DATAFAB when the bug mentioned is fixed.
The SM part works with US_PR_SDDR55.
(Revision Number is 17.08 - that in case the 0000-ffff
should prove to be too optimistic.)
We still must discuss what setup to use for readers like this -
I have several of them - that require different drivers for
different LUNs. As it is now one has to compile usb-storage
twice, once with CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_DATAFAB defined and once
without, and remove one usb-storage.ko and insert the other
to go from CF to SM. (And that hangs with 2.6.4 so a reboot
is required..)

[Two years ago I had a very general setup, and when mdharm
didnt like it, a 2-lun setup, the minimal needed for the
devices I had at that time. They must still live in the
archives somewhere. I forgot all details so have no opinion today.]
