in scsi_lib.c, in scsi_request_fn, near the top of the main
   while (!blk_queue_plugged(q)) {
loop:
		if (!scsi_dev_queue_ready(q, sdev)) {
			if ((req->cmd_flags & REQ_FAILFAST) &&
			    !(req->cmd_flags & REQ_PREEMPT)) {
				scsi_kill_request(req, q);
				continue;
			}
			break;
		}
If I remove the "if failfast and not preempt then kill" logic, my
problem goes away.
