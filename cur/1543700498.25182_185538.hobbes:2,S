It looks like this is what's happening, after tracing the code I added
some stuff to print out everything in the sysfs directory at the time
udev was running, and it is devoid of the vendor & model files which
turn up shortly afterwards.
On the slower laptop, it works as expected.
One question though, it only ever seems to create a device for the
actual usb-storage disk and not the partition.  Is there some magic to
create the partition device instead?
