Yes, we could make dev_t's internally be always 32+32, and do the
marshalling at stat() time. That would actually be my preferred approach, 
and would solve some of the problems with using "dev_t" as an opaque type 
right now (ie it would solve the "discontiguous region" issue.

We HAVE to do the mapping somewhere. Old applications only use the lower 
16 bits, and that's just something that MUST NOT be broken. 
The question is only _where_ (not whether) we do the mapping. Right now we 
keep "dev_t" in teh same format as we give back to user space, and thus we 
always map into that format internally. But we don't have to: we can have 
an internal format that is different from the one we show users.
