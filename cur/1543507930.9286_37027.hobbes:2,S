Hi,
I am trying to use Mark's tool to download ARM-Linux onto ebsa285 (Intel
StrongARM 110 Development
Board) and run it as as co-processor through PCI bus. The host runs
Linux-2.2.10-mvd1, with
nfs-server-2.2beta37-1.i386.rpm and
nfs-server-clients-2.2beta37-1.i386.rpm,
The target runs Linux-2.2.9-rmk3-mvd1. I go the following error message:
     nfs_read_super: get root fattr failed
Is this problem related to NFS? Any suggestions? I can still ping the
target correctly,
The syslog on the host says /arm has been mounted by the target
     Sep  1 17:10:18 james kernel: PCIMSG network driver started
     Sep  1 17:10:18 james kernel: 21285(0): started

     Sep  1 17:10:20 james mountd[466]: /arm has been mounted by
192.168.3.2
I also tried to mount /arm from another Linux PC, and I can do read and
write correctly,
More info with NFSROOT_DEBUG on is enclosed,
