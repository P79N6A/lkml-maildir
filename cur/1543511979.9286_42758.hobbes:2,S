? This is an academic exercise. You are not going to tell there is such
a box
out there? BTW if you didn't hear it before /dev/cuxx's are obsolete.

Easy, very easy indeed: 
~# ls -l /dev/* > /tmp/remember (somewhere on runlevel 6 or S)
and after reboot (somewhere on runlevel 1):
~# cat /tmp/remember | my_very_best_awk_code

BTW. The code in my_very_best_awk_code will remain very simple under
the assumption that there is no great variation between the different
serial ports.
