This thread was there a few months ago, and the conclusion was simple :
C++ sucks when used in kernel contents. To much issues that can't be
resolved.
I think it is simpel : The kernel is written in subset C, and I think we
should keep it that way. c++ is way to overbloated, not to mention slow in
some cases.
