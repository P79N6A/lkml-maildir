as I mentioned with proper locking setting task in uninterruptible and
then registering into the new per classzone waitqueue, the timeout will
be unnecessary even for this.

The additional locking will then remove the current locking in
blk_congestion_wait so it's new locking but it will replace the current
locking. But I agree registering in the waitqueue inside the
blk_congestion_wait was simpler. It's just I've an hard time to like the
timeout.  Timeout is always wrong when it triggers: if it triggers it
always triggers either too late (wasted resources) or too early (early
oom kills). So unless it messes everything up, it'd be nice to the
locking strict. anyway point 1 and 2 can be implemented separately, at
first we can leave the timeout if the race is too hard to handle. 
Ideally if we keep the total number of oustanding writebacks
per-classzone (not sure if we account for it already somewhere, I guess
if something we've the global number and not the per-classzone one), we
could remove the timeout without having to expose the locking outside
blk_congestion_wait. With the number of oustanding writebacks
per-classzone we could truly fix the race and obsolete the timeout in a
self contained manner. Though it will require a proper amount of memory
barriers around the account increment/decrement/read.
