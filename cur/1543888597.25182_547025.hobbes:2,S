I think most people here, at least me too, are used to the same.
At first I didn't even think whether Oleg's feelings about these
barriers were right - it was obvious to me any barriers (!) should
be avoided.
But while reading David's manual I started to doubt: there had to
be some reasons these CPUs were done such nasty way. And probably
it wasn't about punishing the programmers. So, maybe sometimes
good, old habits aren't the best advisors...
