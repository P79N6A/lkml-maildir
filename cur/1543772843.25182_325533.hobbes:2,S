Hrm, I just tried the same emulation on NUMA-Q that I did for ppc64:
inline do_monotonic_clock()
{
	return jiffies_to_nsecs(jiffies - INITIAL_JIFFIES);
}
and kernbench ran ok with just my patches on top of 2.6.12-rc6-git5. So,
I think -- not positive, admittedly, the problem may be with John's
patches on NUMA-Q, maybe even just some of the timesources.
Thanks,
Nish
