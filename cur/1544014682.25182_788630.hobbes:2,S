In my defense, the -rt versions of the patches guarantee this is ok
based on a little hack:
"if the owner holds the mutex, and you old the wait-lock, you guarantee
owner cannot exit". Therefore get_task_struct is guaranteed not to race
if you take it while holding wait-lock. (This is, in fact, why the
original design had a loop within a loop...the inner loop would break
when it wanted the outer-loop to reacquire wait-lock for things such as
re-acquiring owner/get-task
This is in part enforced by the fact that in -rt, pending pending
waiters force the mutex-release to hit the slow path (and therefore
require that the wait-lock be reacquired by the releaser). I am under
the impression (because I havent had a chance to really review the new
patches yet) that this is not necessarily the case here for the mainline
patch, since the owner field is not managed atomically IIUC
Again, not advocating get/put task per se. Just wanted to point out that
I didnt flub this up on the original -rt design ;)
