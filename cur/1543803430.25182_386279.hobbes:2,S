Hi,
If this example kernel functions is called, it will generate an oops, kill 
the current process, and subsequent tries to call it will hang the process 
trying to do so.
        static struct semaphore x;
        void f(void) {
            int *p = NULL;
            down(&x);
            *p++;
            up(&x);
        }
Is there a specific term (other than "hang") associated with this 
situation? It's not a "dead-lock", because there is no other process 
(anymore) which could potentially up the semaphore.
