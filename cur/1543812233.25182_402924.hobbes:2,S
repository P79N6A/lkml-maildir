Yeah, that's great, but not really the same which I want to do.
My statistics about the kernel configuration and the loaded modules will be 
much easier, especially easier to read. ;)
But that's not the only last thing which is planned.
I'm also planning an interface for users where they should be able to let 
the interface/webpage generate the best matching .config for their kernel 
based on the provided hard- and software. *g*
And it will provide an interactive helpsystem around the kernel-options and 
much more.
Well more user (newbie) orientated, you see?
