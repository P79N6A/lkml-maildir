I don't know if anything I say is usefull, but: The keys on my remote
and those on the ati-remotes doesn't seem to share the same 'hex-
code' (?).  I had to manually find out each code per key (I didn't know
how to do it).  The hardwarealso has other (and maybe more) keys.  The
ati remote has mouse-buttons for example.  In the code I sent earlier, I
made a ASCII-scetch of how my remote looks like (if someone wants it,
I'll put a photot online ;)).  So, I think the driver will need to
separate tables to choose from when it knows which remote is used.  
Secondly, I'd like to say that I HAD to change the Vendor_ID - thing to
let it work with my remote (found it out using lsusb ;)).
Don't shoot me if I say anything irrevelant, and I'll stay around for
testing and stuff, even my evolution-filters arenot what they should be
- they copy it both in my Inbox and my 'Linux-kernel'-directory :|
greets,
Karel "scapor" Demeyer.
