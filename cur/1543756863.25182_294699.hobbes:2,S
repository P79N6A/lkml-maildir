Subject: [PATCH] i386 ramdisk_max fix for < 1GB kernel space

There was a vmalloc tuning patch made back in September 2004 that reserved 
a larger amount of memory for vmalloc. Unfortunately, the patch does not 
work properly for modified kernels where the kernel's virtual address 
space has been reduced to 512MB or less.
More specifically, if __PAGE_OFFSET is set to 0xE0000000 (reducing the 
kernel's virtual address space to 512MB), then the code:
     ramdisk_max:   .long (-__PAGE_OFFSET-(512 << 20)-1) & 0x7fffffff
results in a ramdisk_max of 0x7fffffff which is out of bounds. The patch 
is to change the above code to:
     ramdisk_max:   .long (((-__PAGE_OFFSET) / 2) - 1) & 0x7fffffff
This keeps the spirit of the original patch and reserves 512MB of space 
for vmalloc when __PAGE_OFFSET is not modified (0xc0000000). If 
__PAGE_OFFSET is lowered (increasing the kernel's virtual address space), 
more vmalloc space is proportionally reserved. If __PAGE_OFFSET is 
increased (my case), less vmalloc space is reserved.
