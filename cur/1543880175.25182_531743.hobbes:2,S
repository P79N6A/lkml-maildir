OK.  And it's very much appreciated :)

I've tried to make this unprivileged mount thing as simple as
possible, and no simpler.  If we can make it even simpler, all the
better.

You mean rbind+chroot and clone(CLONE_NS)?  Yes, those are two
different mechanisms achieving very similar results.  But what has
this to do with unprivileged mounts?

The flag permitting the unprivileged mounts (which we now agreed to
name "allowusermnt") is used in both cases.
Just creating a new namespace doesn't always imply that you want to
allow user mounts inside, does it?  These are orthogonal features.

The "user=UID" or (or MNT_USER flag) serves multiple purposes:
  - help mount(8) move away from /etc/mtab
  - allow unprivileged umounts
  - account user mounts

Why is handling unprivileged mounts in kernel different from handling
them in userspace in this respect?
