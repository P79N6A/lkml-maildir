Know your tools.
/etc/fstab:
UUID=eba05cbf-55ff-44d7-846a-7846c6010843 /usr ext2 defaults,nocheck 0 2
I have this mounted right now, on 2.2.19:
/dev/sdb7              3936400   3597588    138852  97% /usr
That's an ext2 partition ID, so even if repartitioning renumbers the  
partition, mount will still find it - only mkfs forces me to use a new ID.  
Changing the controller and SCSI id obviously makes no difference  
whatsoever. I could use labels, too, but they tend to be less unique.
/proc/partitions is necessary to know what partitions to look at, of  
course.

Exactly. So you can't use the order if there's any possibility of this, so  
you need to use the MAC address.
