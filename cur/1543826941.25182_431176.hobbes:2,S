Ingo,
	This fix will be needed in 2.6.17-rc6-rt1, as it includes the x86-64
TOD conversion (not yet in -mm).
I accidentally used the kernel-mapped vsyscall_gtod_data value, 
rather then the user-mapped __vsyscall_gtod_data value in do_get_tz.
This would cause gettimeofday to segfault when using a non-null 
timezone pointer.
Many thanks to Martin Murray, who pointed out this issue and its fix.
thanks
