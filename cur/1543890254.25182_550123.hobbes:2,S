Allocating memory before the hibernation, mainly.  Anything done after freezing
tasks.

Do you mean POST_RESTORE?  Well, maybe not.  Yesterday I thought it would be
for a specific reason, but now I can't recall what it was. :-(

I think the two suspend-specific might be handy.
What about:
PM_PRE_FREEZE
PM_HIBERNATION_PREPARE
PM_POST_HIBERNATION (handling failed snapshots too)
PM_POST_THAW
plus PM_RESTORE_PREPARE for the restore and
PM_SUSPEND_PREPARE
PM_POST_SUSPEND (handling failed suspends too)
for the suspend code path?
