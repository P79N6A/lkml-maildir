What about the following dmesg logs:

Don't they imply an APIC?
Anyway, I am sending the dmesg with "#define DEBUG 1" in pci-i386.h. It is a
2.4.4-ac5 defconfig kernel, but 2.4.4 has the same errors. System is an
MS-6330 v3.0 (MSI K7T Turbo), KT133A, Duron 700. I you have any idea, how I
could fix the pirq table I'd be glad to test further.
Regards, Axel.
