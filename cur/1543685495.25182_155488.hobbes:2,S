Funny. Just yesterday or so I was going through old IDE notes
and discarding all that was outdated. Quoting from memory:
Andre: PDC 20265 pukes in 48-bit DMA clean in PIO primary -
secondary is OK.
Last September or so there was a long discussion about a
filesystem that was destroyed. But what I recall is that
in the end it turned out not to be a hardware problem,
but a precedence problem - two missing parentheses in the driver.
Google will tell you all, I suppose. Search for Promise and Isely.
