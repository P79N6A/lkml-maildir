Lets take an example, I'm DA graphics card vendor, I write a DRI driver
for my brand new 3d graphics cards (they rock btw :-), people buy loads of
them, I want to give them something on my website that they can deploy to
use their new card, like a driver for ANotherOS. Now I just want to give
them an XFree DDX, DRI driver and a drm module (in source form, that they
can use no matter what kernel), now at the moment no matter what kernel
they have, the DRM is a completly separate entity - the DRM code deals
with it,
If we make a library split that sits inside the kernel, their DRM can
stop working if someone busts the interface, hence the idea of having the
core reg/dereg in the kernel, and locking it down, then they can ship a
complete DRM source tree, and do as they wish as long as they interface
properly with the core...
Dave.
