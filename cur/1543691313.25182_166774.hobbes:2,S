2.4 has gotten to the old habit again of breaking other architectures
faster than they can be fixed ;-/ It's already fixed in the x86-64.org CVS. 
I have a bigger patchkit that I plan to merge to Marcelo soon, but 
didn't have time to clean it up for him yet.
For a very raw patch (still some uglities etc.) you can 
use 
ftp://ftp.x86-64.org/pub/linux/v2.4/x86_64-2.4.23pre4-0.bz2
Also note that ext3 seems to be broken currently (at least since 2.4.22)
