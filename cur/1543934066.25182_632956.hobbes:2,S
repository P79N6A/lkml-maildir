[NOTE: I added netdev to this thread to gather some input.  @netdev folks, the 
problem is that the skb->iif field contains garbage in some cases which is 
causing problems for some new SELinux network code.  The exact problem 
probably isn't too important for this discussion, what is important is that 
the skb->iif field contains a non-zero garbage value some of the time on 
incoming packets.]
I'm pretty certain this is an uninitialized value problem now and not a 
use-after-free issue.  The invalid/garbage ->iif value seems to only happen 
on packets that are generated locally and sent back into the stack for local 
consumption, e.g. loopback.  These local packets also need to have been 
cloned at some point, either on the output or input path.
The problem appears to be a skb_clone() function which does not clear the skb 
structure properly and fails to copy the ->iif value from the original skb to 
the cloned skb.  From what I can tell, there are two possible solutions to 
this problem:
 1. Clear all of the cloned skb fields in skb_clone() via memset()
 2. Copy the ->iif field in __copy_skb_header()
I don't have a good enough understanding of all the details involving skb 
memory management to know if option #1 is a Good Idea or not, but option #2 
seems much simpler and solves the problem of garbage in the ->iif field.  My 
preference is to go with option #2 but before I submit a patch does anyone 
think this is the wrong solution?
