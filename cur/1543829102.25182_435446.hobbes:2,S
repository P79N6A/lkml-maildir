I think this makes sense. We are hitting line 172 in case of -mm because
f8b3c00e is not a valid io port at all. Maximum valid value can be 0xffff.
So _request_region considers this to be a conflict and returns.
 
It succeeds in -rc6 because ide code is requesting a valid ioport region
ide2[310e->310e].
So __request_region() code seems to be fine. Problem seems to be that
why do we get an invalid ioport range in following call.
addr = hwif->io_ports[IDE_CONTROL_OFFSET];
Either hwif pointer is bad or somehow the location it is pointing to
is corrupt or something else. Can you do some more tracing on hwif.
Thanks
Vivek
