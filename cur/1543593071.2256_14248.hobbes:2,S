I think these changes have broken my USB wheel mouse.
Events seems to be getting lost (/dev/input/mice)
It only scrolls when either the scroll direction has changed or if other
mouse events occur (e.g. you need to wiggle mouse from side to side to
scroll down a long page in mozilla)
problems seems to be in drivers/usb/hid-core.c hid_input_field line 772
	for (n = 0; n < count; n++) {
		if (HID_MAIN_ITEM_VARIABLE & field->flags) {
			if ((field->flags & HID_MAIN_ITEM_RELATIVE) && !value[n])
				continue;
The next 2 lines are dropping the scroll wheel events (which appear in the
input code as type:2, code: 8, value -1 or 1 depending on direction)
			if (value[n] == field->value[n])
				continue;
			hid_process_event(hid, field, &field->usage[n], value[n]);
			continue;
		}
Works fine in ac3.
