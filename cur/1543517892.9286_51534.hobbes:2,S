It can be fixed by exporting the in flight informations via /proc. Just
browse all unix sockets and then look at the per-sock in-flight packets
(UNIXCB(skb).fp field). The only brainer part should be the locking.
Then fuser can be changed to check the unix in-flight /proc info too.
I have not tried if lsof just catches these in flight fds (I really bet no).
If the number of security troubles is > 1, that's not a good point to left
all them not fixed IMHO.
