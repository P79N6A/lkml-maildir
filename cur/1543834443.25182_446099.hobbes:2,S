I saw that as well many times with both git vesrion 1.2.4 and 1.4.1:
git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git 
linux-2.6
Generating pack...
Done counting 293611 objects.
Deltifying 293611 objects.
 100% (293611/293611) done
fatal: unexpected EOF)      
fatal: packfile '/home/me/linux/linux-2.6/.git/objects/pack/tmp-FtdxDS' SHA1 
mismatch
error: git-fetch-pack: unable to read from git-index-pack
error: git-index-pack died with error code 128
fetch-pack from 
'git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git' 
failed.
Each time it fails after downloading approx. 60MB of data. Reported to vger 
git list with no response.
