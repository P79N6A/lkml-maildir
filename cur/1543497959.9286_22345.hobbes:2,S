Subject: [patch] Riva framebuffer driver (non-working)

The nVidia 3D source release spurred me to hack together a kernel driver
for Riva 128/TNT/TNT2 cards...  but I won't actually have a Riva card
until payday, in another few weeks.  ;-)
Since I am turning back to the S3 driver, I am posting what I have, in
the hopes that kernel hackers and Riva owners can give me a little
feedback.  It compiles, and the logic is 90% in place, but don't
consider it even close to working.
The driver is available as a patch against 2.3.3:

Patch notes:
* riva_decode_var needs to be implemented, smartly.  This is the only
missing piece for what is needed to actually have a working driver.
* includes some patches to fbgen that I hope to eventually send to Geert
* other than that, read the FIXMEs...
