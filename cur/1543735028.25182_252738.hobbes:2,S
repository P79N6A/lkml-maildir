An IXP or PowerNP wouldn't work for Jeff's idea. The IXP's XScale core 
and PowerNP's PowerPC core are way too slow to do any significant 
processing; they are intended for control tasks like updating the 
routing tables. All the work in the IXP or PowerNP is done by the 
microengines, which have weird, non-Linux-compatible architectures.
To do 10 Gbps Ethernet with Jeff's approach, wouldn't you need a 5-10 
GHz processor on the card? Sounds expensive.
A 440GX or BCM1250 on a cheap PCI card would be fun to play with, though.
