Subject: ipip tunnel - route complains!

Hi,
it looks like I can't get ipip tunneling to work. I use kernel 2.1.131 and
net-tools 1.49. I asked for help a few days ago and someone told me to
upgrade to the newest net-tools. Done. Still the same problem:
This is my route config:
+NEW_ADDRT +RTF_IRTT +RTF_REJECT -I18N
AF: (inet) +UNIX +INET -INET6 +IPX -AX25 -NETROM +ATALK -ECONET -ROSE 
HW:  +ETHER -ARC -SLIP -PPP +TUNNEL -TR -AX25 -NETROM -FR -ROSE -ASH -SIT
-FDDI -HIPPI -HDLC/LAPB
Short version of what I tried:
ifconfig tunl0 192.168.1.44 netmask 255.255.255.255 up
route add -net 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 134.147.2.1 dev tunl0
SIOCADDRT: Network is unreachable
Route only accepts this without a gateway (obviously useless). 134.147.2.1
is definitely reachable, and the other end of the tunnel there (2.0.36)
seems to work flawlessly. When I ping 192.168.1.44 from there, I see the
echo requests for my host when using tcpdump.
I think this is my last try, thanks in advance!
Patrick
