Hello!
Apparently the patch to add kernel.suid_dumpable sysctl:
http://kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=d6e711448137ca3301512cec41a2c2ce852b3d0a
was applied wrongly - the sysctl was added under "fs" instead of "kernel".
So currently it is fs.suid_dumpable instead of kernel.suid_dumpable, but
the docs (Documentation/sysctl/kernel.txt) and include/linux/sysctl.h
(KERN_SETUID_DUMPABLE) say that it should be under "kernel".
Which way this should be fixed - should the sysctl definition be moved
from fs_table to kern_table (thus moving it from fs.suid_dumpable to
kernel.suid_dumpable, as docs say), or should docs be fixed to reflect the
current location of sysctl (and include/linux/sysctl would need to be
fixed too)?
I have filed this as 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6145
 to
make sure it is not forgotten completely.
