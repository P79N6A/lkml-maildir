You can recompile old driver if changes were not significant (that is: in
99% cases) or you should rework driver due deep changes in kernel anyway.
Just like you can not use binary driver from Windows95 in WindowsNT you
can not use source code for linux 1.2.13 driver in linux 2.2.14. You CAN
expect from driver for 2.2.0 to be compileable and useable in 2.2.14.
And it's usually the case. Not always -- just like Windows NT SP4 can break
drivers compatibility sometimes.
So 1. is not reason to support portable binary drivers. Linux's source
drivers works just as well.

On other hand this WILL require to use uneeficient code (take look on
spinlocks, for example) in drivers. EVEN if driver is binary only Windows95
driver it STILL can alter other driver to fix error there (we cooked such
drivers here to workaround some Windows95 problem). So binary drivers WILL NOT
make life easier. Published API is good and kkeping driver from using kernel
inetrnals are good but binary drivers WILL NOT help here.
So to solve 2. you need solid API and control and binary drivers DO NOT HELP
here. This problem is orthogonal to availability of portable binary drivers.

Not at all. Driver does not live in vacuum. It interacts with system. And
binary drivers will not help here (see above).

How you can *really* know if your driver can be used with Windows98 if it
was fine with Windows95 ? Answer: you can not. Even if theory interface is
the same on practice you need deep rework to make in working with Windows98
(been there, done that).
So once more it's not reason to make binary portable drivers possible.
You need regression testing with any kernel version with or without protable
binary drivers.

And guess what ? Binary compatibility between versions will be ZERO help.
ABSOLUTELY zero. NE2000 are not there NOT since driver can not be used across
different kernel versions -- it can (with recompilation, obviously). The
problem is that driver is not stable enough to include such cards as
"Tier one".

How long device is available is often irrelevant. What IS relevant is
clearility of device design and number of variations for the "same"
hardware. Take look on aic7xxx driver: it's here for A LONG time, it's
maintainer CONSTANTLY tries to workaround bugs in different incarnations
of that beast and STILL it often lock ups and generally does not work
properly. How long crap is available is irrelevant: if card is crap driver
will be crap. With binary compatibility across kernel versions of without.

And know what ? Very often problems can be solved by small changes in driver
and recompilation... That's what you can not do with binary drivers...

You were unlucky :-) As we are used EXACTLY same configuration many times
sucessfully. The problem with NE2000 is that there are A LOT OF different
cards marked "NE2000-compatible". A lot of work great. Some lock ups
occasionly. Some did not work at all. Last time we used Novell Netware
with binary drivers (just year ago) the same was true for Novell Netware
as well.

Relax. If it works for few days then it mean that it'll work just fine
for few years. Till you'll change kernel version at least. It's true for Linux,
Netware or Windows. And yes, 3c905B not listed as "Tier 1" exactly since
drivers are not solid enough. If you think that binary drivers will help
here you are wrong. It's not a case.

I bet problem was triggered not by changes in driver but by deep rework of
network code. It's just like overclocked processors: 2.2.x fails MUCH faster
on them then 2.0.x kernel. It does not mean 2.2.x is buggier -- it's just
means you have buggy hardware. You had it even with 2.0.x -- it just was not
stressed enough.

Unfortunatelly I know of NO WAY to ensure such compatibility. Novell Netware
has such problems, Windows NT has such problems, Sun OS is not exception, etc...
All of them are implemented "driver conformance tests", are using binary drivers
and so on. Still problem persists. MAY BE (I think that this problem will be
here forever, but who knows?) problem can be solved but binary drivers are NOT
way to solve this problem. It can make problem worse, not better.

I'm yet to see hard numbers to prove that claim. Yes, I heard that "FreeBSD
is more stable" claim many times. I NEVER seen numbers behind such claims.
And EVEN if such numbers are exist it proves nothing: FreeBSD and Linux are
way to different to make claim that FreeBSD is more stable due to support
of binary portable kernel modules.

To make binary portable drivers possible they need to do some serious work.
Since binary posrtable drivers does not help to solve ANY problems important
for them why to do this work ? This is the reason. What Linus said is the
following: since you can do open-source kernel driver for 3dfx when
specifications are open why we should try to do a lot of work and support
binary only drivers ? So you DO NOT need reasons to reject protable binary
drivers support. Not at all. It's the other way around: you need strong,
REALLY STRONG reason to support them.
Binary portable drivers are not implemented in Linux NOT since Linus and Alan
want to force someone to do something. They are not implemented since noone
proved that it will help to make things better. When something done with Linux
kernel it's done on purpose. And IF portable binary drivers will be supported
(in UDI form or any other form) it'll be done on purpose. What's the reason to
support them ? I see only one clear reason to make such drivers possible: to
help companies to keep specs in secret. And Linus responce for THAT benefit
sound quite reasonable:
