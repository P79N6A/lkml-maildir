Hi,
    When trying to compile module for sym53c416 I received an error 
'address not in structure'.  I traced this to - asm-i386/scatterlist.h. 
 It is missing - char * address - at the beginning of the structure.  I 
copied scatterlist.h from 2.4.18 and it compiled fine.
Hope this helps,
Don Tonks
