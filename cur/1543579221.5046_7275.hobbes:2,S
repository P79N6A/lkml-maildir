This turned out to be more difficult than I thought...
I suspect glibc-2.2-12 being the reason, but I'm not quite sure yet:
The problem is, that the 64-bit dirent's are converted to 32-bit
dirent's
and a sanity check is performed, if the inodes or offsets don't fit into
32 bits.
The offset of the last entry is 4294967295 (no, not -1),
this won't fit in a signed 32 bit number.
Does this number come from the SGI or from the NFS stuff in the Linux
kernel?
