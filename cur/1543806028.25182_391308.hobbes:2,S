Let's address the second bug first. Linux provides full
bus number and LUN info for all block devices. You get it
like this:
struct stat sbuf;
stat("/dev/hdc", &sbuf);
int bus = sbuf.st_mode>>12;
int target = major(sbuf.st_rdev);
int lun = minor(sbuf.st_rdev);
That makes as much sense as anything, and it lets you quickly
find back the device by scanning /dev.
As for ide-scsi, your right, it's horribly broken. We should
just get rid of it. If there is anything that the normal driver
is unable to do well, I'm sure you'll let us know.
