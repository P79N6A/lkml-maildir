I think i've turned full scsi logging on while compiling the kernel.
Somewhere i read that this can cause infinite loop if the log file also
resides on scsi disk.
Currently i'm testing a new (pseudo) device driver on scsi device driver.
While writing to that device , the use appl hangs though the system is
usable.
Can it be because of above problem, since i find no problem in using the
mounted file system which resides on scsi disk.
Thanks
PS: pl cc the responses to me as i'm not on the group
