No -- this is full duplex.  The write_then_read() helper is
simplifying a common half-duplex idiom for short operations,
but the harware still does full duplex.  Buffer layout is:
  Before:	WWWWW0000000
  After:	xxxxxRRRRRRR
That is, for every bit shifted out (W, 0) another one gets
shifted in (x, R).  The I/O primitive essentially swaps
contents of a one-word shift register between master and
slave; or, sequences of such words.  Words don't need to
be byte-size, though that's a common option.

See above.  We only want the "R" bits which were shifted in
right *after* the n_tx "W" bits.  If we offset rx_buf before
the I/O, we'd start with the "x" don't-care bits and need to
do something else to discard them.  (Plus, allocate more
space at the end of the buffer.)
