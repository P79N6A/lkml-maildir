I have been suffering similar problems for some time, with a box quite
older than yours, and with different kernels which wouldn't boot.
For example, old Debian Potato 2.2.17 always booted fine, but 2.2.18
sometimes failed at the same place as in your machine. 2.2.19 was a real
pain to make it boot, as well as some 2.4.x kernels. Sometimes the
machine hangs, sometimes it reboots. From some specific 2.4.x kernel
version (exact version number is lost somewhere in my mind, but maybe
2.4.13+, maybe earlier) any kernel booted fine.
One day I tried again to boot those "problematic" kernels from the same
PC, now upgraded to Woody, and the problems appeared in the same places.
One thing that I noticed is that Alan's 2.4.x-acY kernels had no
problems booting where plain 2.4.x kernels failed.
Hope thos helps.
