But it might be considered overengineering to actually take those steps
when you're not sure if the direction is the right one :)
Maybe we should ask Al Viro if we can use his in-kernel XML parser and
take care of the extensibility requirements once and for all? ;-)

Right, but can we get away with some sort of vague "I think we need to
go in _that_ direction eventually" spec for now, and just see how many
existing drivers and hardware we can support with just some basic
interfaces, and get a better idea about what we need to support the
remaining ones?

That would indeed be good to know, and is in fact the reason why I Cc'd
Paul and Francis in the first place.
