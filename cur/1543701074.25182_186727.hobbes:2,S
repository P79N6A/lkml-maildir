Hi Guldo, I assume you are using the kernel mode
driver (kernel module) and not the user mode driver
(pppoa2, pppoa3).  For that you need to compile the
kernel module.

It works the same as the module in 2.4.22 and later.
This module was originally only available outside the
kernel tree (it can be found for example in the
speedbundle on 
http://linux-usb.sf.net/SpeedTouch
).
Now that it is in the kernel tree it is pointless to
compile it in the speedbundle (and it doesn't work
right now for 2.6 kernels).  Just turn it on in your
kernel .config and recompile your kernel.

Well, you still need to turn on ATM support etc,
but there is no need to patch the kernel for example.

With
CONFIG_USB_SPEEDTOUCH=m
at least.
Ciao,
Duncan.
