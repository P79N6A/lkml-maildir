21728B - tarred and gzipped, that's about 5sec on an average modem
connection - how much would that be in $?? Come on...

You don't have to download the kernel (it's been said on this list so many
time, that it's getting boring...) as a monolithic tarball... That's what
the patches were invented for. Having sources for 1.x you can upgrade to
2.3.34 - just the patches... So your argument is completely bogus.

Good for you.

more? There are few things in the kernel driver tree that are NOT modular.

So DON'T DOWNLOAD THEM. Download the patches and live happily.
