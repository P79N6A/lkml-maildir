  I'm still looking at this, trying to figure out what they were trying to
do here... but I note the same code in parport_gsc.c was NOT
changed. Putting it back makes it work for me, but the code is not long on
comments, and digging up all the data sheets for various supported chips
is not a casual job.
  I'm going to browse the code more this week, the bit not set isn't
documented where I've looked :-(
  Anyway, back to working, perhaps there was a note with the patch giving
some hint of what it was doing?

  Programming without software engineering is like sculpting with a chain
saw. The very talented can produce a work of art, the mediocre wind up with
a misshapen lump in a pile of rubble, and in neither case does the end
result have more than a passing resemblance to the original intent.
