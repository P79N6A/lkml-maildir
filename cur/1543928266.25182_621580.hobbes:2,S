I see it on my G4 powerbook.  However, a compute-bound task runs just
as fast (i.e. completes in the same elapsed time) as on older kernels,
so it does look like it is just an accounting problem.  If the CPU was
really spending more than half its time servicing hardware interrupts,
the task should take more than twice as long to complete.
