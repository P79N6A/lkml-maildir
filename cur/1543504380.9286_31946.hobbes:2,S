Disagree.  You can get into some pretty ugly starvation situations on a
system with inversion.  The "deadlocks" aren't really deadlocks at all, but
cases where a process gets it's priority knocked down for so long everyone
backs up behind it if it is holding mutexes.  I've seen some pretty busted
crap on older versions of Solaris (circa 1991) that used inversion models
before they adopted inheritance.  I agree that in most real world situations
these problems don't show up, but there's always someone out there putting
out apps that uses locks excessively.  Folks might be splitting hairs here,
but historically, this is the case folks make against inversion.  It's an
SMP problem almost exclusively and is tied to how priorities are managed in
the kernel.
