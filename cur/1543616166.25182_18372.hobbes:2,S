Someone posted one of the DMA Overrun on write error messages to me, and 
that allowed me to see that on the SiS hardware we are getting garbage in 
the upper 3 bits of the LVI register (presumably because we read garbage 
from the upper 3 bits of the CIV register).  So, I've put a 0.15 version of 
my driver on my site that now bounds our LVI and CIV reads so that we mask 
out any possible garbage.  And, since writing garbage to LVI could keep the 
hardware going in loops forever and other sorts of bad things, it might 
solve your problem.  Please give it a try and let me know how it works.
