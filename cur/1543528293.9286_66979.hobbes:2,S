I had to reboot my workstation yesterday (scsi disk started showing
errors), so I took the opportunity to update from 2.2.12 to 2.2.15pre11
(my uptime of >100 days was going out the window anyway).
Everything OK, only the 3c509 card wasn't detected (no messages
whatsoever appeared about it). I had the 3c509 fixed in the kernel.
I've now built it as a module, and that loads just fine. Might be
worth looking into.
Sorry, can't play around too much for this, this is a system that needs
to be up as much as possible. Primary i/f is DC21143 (works fine fixed
in the kernel). No SMP.

Doesn't sound related... However, between pre4 and pre11 there's this
extra patch to 3c509.c:
+       ((struct el3_private *)dev->priv)->lock = (spinlock_t) SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED;
