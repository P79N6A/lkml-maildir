BTW, I noticed one of my last my email was a private reply so I'll
answer here too for the buffer_head pagecache I/O part:
Having persistence on the physical I/O information is a good thing, so
you don't need to resolve logical to physical block at every I/O and bio
has a cost to setup too. The information we carry on the bh isn't
superflous, it's needed for the I/O so even if you don't use the
buffer_head you will still need some other memory to hold such
information, or alternatively you need to call get_block (and serialize
in the fs) at every I/O even if you've plenty of ram free. So I don't
think the current setup is that stupid, current bh only sucks for the
rawio and that's fixed by bio.
