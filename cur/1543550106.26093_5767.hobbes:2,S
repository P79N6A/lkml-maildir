I don't agree with you.  After all, what you're saying is to use the features
of a language even if it's not a good idea.  What if I don't like templates?
Or exception handlers?  Heck, what if I don't like using // as a comment
delimiter?  Does that make me a bad C++ programmer?  In some cases, even though
the "textbook" says to use a template, the result could be such horrid code
that you spend more time debugging it than writing it.

I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
