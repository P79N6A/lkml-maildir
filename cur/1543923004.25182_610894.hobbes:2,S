FWIW I like this patch better.

Why don't we just return -ENOMEM here just like all other APIs in the
kernel? And I wonder if it makes more sense to store gfp_flags in
struct stringbuf and always use that? I mean, why would you want to
sometimes do GFP_ATOMIC and GFP_KERNEL allocations for the same
buffer?
