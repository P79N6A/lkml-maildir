Hi,
maybe this could be a compromise between the suid0/sticky solutions:
Advantage of suid 0:
   If the fs is used by an old kernel or another OS, only root can
   create/modify executables with caps, this prevents a security hole.
Advantage of sticky bit:
   The suid settings used by an old kernel can be configured independent
   from the caps settings used by a new kernel.
To take the best of both I would like to suggest:
1. Use the sticky bit
2. Allow a mount option so that the sticky/caps bit is only honored if
   the executable is owned by root and writable only by root.
This would allow the _sysadmin_ to decide if it is appropriate to get ride
of the special meaning of UID 0.
A caps-purist in a homogeneous environment could allow the sticky/caps bit
used independent of an UID.
A pragmatic person in a heterogeneous environment could restrict the
caps-functionality in shared filesystems to files owned by UID 0.
