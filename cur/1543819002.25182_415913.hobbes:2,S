      It's because in modprobe.c, in the read_config_file , in the
wildcard , the "-" (hyphen) is turned into underscore (_) causing the
fnmatch not to match the first RE.
  a quick change to check this issue is
following change in read_config_file function of modprobe.c should fix it.
                if (strcmp(cmd, "alias") == 0) {
                        char *wildcard
                                = strsep_skipspace(&ptr, "\t ");
                        char *realname
                                = strsep_skipspace(&ptr, "\t ");
