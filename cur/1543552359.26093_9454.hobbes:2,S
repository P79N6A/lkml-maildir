Just one: let's slow down a bit and try to write down the rules. Close to
release or not, let's understand WTF happens in that part of VM before
deciding on the choice of band-aids/fixes. Frankly, right now I don't feel
that area - too many changes during the last month. So I'm going to sit
down and read it through. IMO it's worth the delay - I have a gut feeling
that band-aids are going to cost more.
