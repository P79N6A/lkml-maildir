Hi Ravi. 
The function itself looks correct, I've done it this way in several
cases, too. However, you MUST make sure that your function1 is not
called while the timer is still running (or protect it by a if
(timer_pending(&period_timer)) return;  ). Else the add_timer()
completely messes up the timer list. So, for debugging I'd add the
following:
	...	
	if (timer_pending(&period_timer)) {
		printk(KERN_DEBUG "oops, timer still running\n");
		return;
	}
	...
Gruss
