Yes (/sys/src/cmd/acid/*, /sys/src/libmach/*). As for porting... I suspect
that it's easier to write a native equivalent than to emulate their procfs
mechanisms and notes handling. Heck, core stuff (.../acid/*) is 90Kb of
sparse C; our ext2 implementation is several times larger. License is the
usual Plan 9 one, but it applies to source, not to ideas or language
itself... If the core is to be embedded into a kernel (*note*: these guys
didn't bother with that themselves) it certainly needs rewrite anyway.
Note on C style: they keep all library API in one include file, e.g.
libc.h, libmach.h, libregex.h, etc. u.h is the kernel API. libfoo.h
normally contains #pragma lib "libfoo.a", so they don't have to mention
libraries in mkfiles explicitly - derive that information from what is
included. mkfile is equivalent of Makefile - slightly different syntax,
but mostly isomorphic to GNU make. Directory hierarchy is different from
usual for recent Unices - their /usr is our /home and /sys - our /usr;
machine-dependent stuff lives in /{386,alpha,sparc,...}/{bin,lib,include}
