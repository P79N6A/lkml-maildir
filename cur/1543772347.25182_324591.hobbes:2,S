How can I confirm this? I am booting off a livecd and I have tried to see
whether the 'debug' bootprompt option would give more info, but no such
luck.
My current system is based on 2.4.27 (gcc 3.3.1).and I haven't found any
clear info yet on how to upgrade to 2.6 otherwise I would just try to
upgrade to 2.6 and build a kernel with some printk's.
