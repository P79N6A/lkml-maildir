Gérard, I very much appreciate the time you are spending answering my
queries and posts.  You are truly a kind-hearted person to assist me so
much!  Thank you!
See below for comments...
Thus spoke Gerard Roudier:

I tried this.  In the middle of the stress test, I got some SCSI errors, and
then the root partition was completely and utterly corrupted.
So, I switched back to "safe:y,settle:2".  I am stress testing this now (of
course, only the SEAGATE is one the chain).  It seems to be surviving the
stress test.
I do get occasional timeouts and resets, but you had mentioned that this was
normal.
Now, can you give me any suggestions on what feature it might have been that
caused the ext2fs corruption, etc.

Agreed.
> Let us assume that the system is stable. :)
It is not.  :)  Well, at least when I am not in safe mode.
BTW, The cabling all brand-new as is the terminator.  I checked the
connections, etc. to make sure everything was tight and correct.
It appears that not in safe mode, there are real problems on the bus.
Do you have any idea what could be causing them?

I was able to stop right here, as you can see above.  The SEAGATE is not ok
on the bus, unless it is in safe mode.

I got slowed down because of the ext2fs crash on the root partition :).  My
plan now is to see if the system stays stable under "safe:y,settle:2" for a
while, and then move on to the newer drivers then.

The normal setup, even with just the SEAGATE on the bus made things very
worse.

Ah, I see.  As I said, "safe:y,settle:2" works pretty well, but it is slow.
