The mmc code is a mess (mostly my fault for the addition of SD support)
and I'm trying to break things apart to clear the code up. That
unfortunately meant moving files around.

My goal with putting it in -mm was to give people a chance to cry bloody
murder before I merged the stuff (which I intend to do immediately post
2.6.21). The changes are all over the place, so to ease my mind I prefer
to have it simmer for a while.
As to making your life easier, send patches to the mmc layer my way and
I'll handle the conflicts. I made the mess so it's only fair that I have
to clean it up.

It should go in now, along with a fix to unregister the interrupt. I
have a bunch of fixes I intend to push to Linus today and I'll include
this in that group.
