  On i386 the CPU automatically switches to the stack corresponding to
the privilege level (PL) of the interrupt handler, then pushes the
instruction pointer and flags onto that stack.  It is theoretically
possible to write unprivileged interrupt handlers by using conforming
code segments, in which case a stack switch will not occur, but such a
handler cannot touch anything but registers and stack so it's not very
useful.
