Uhm.  The only things you can bridge together are ethernet devices.
An IP tunnel is not an ethernet device, is it?  This requirement is
there because the bridge just fowards ethernet frames, and knows
nothing about doing neighbour resolution (ARP) to get the right MAC
address, etc.
You might want to fiddle something with proxy ARP.
