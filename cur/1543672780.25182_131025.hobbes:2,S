Does anyone know about  how Intel x86 debug register monitor the write
access to a specified mem address? I looked the gdb code and found only the
process VM address of the variable to be watched is writen to the debug
register. Does it mean that x86 debug register only watchs the VM address? I
want to know if Intel hardware watchs the real physical address or VM
address or CPU cache? where can I find this info? I didnt find it in intel
manual.
