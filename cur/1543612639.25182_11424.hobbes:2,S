The patch that Jens posted was the fix for the oops I posted. The oops
was related to the bio stuff and not to the release() locking. I only
mentioned the keyboard stuff because I initially didn't know if there
was any connection between that and the oops.

Yes - and it cured the oops (the one in the thread you refer to), however
the keyboard problems are still there.
I guess there's something wrong with the changes you made, and it only
shows with the modifications that Andrew made - and since he says he
only fixed some bits of the code, the broken bits must have been there
before.
Regards,
Udo.
