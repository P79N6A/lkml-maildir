Still have to try with -mm2, but with mm1, my i2c temp sensors are scaled by 10 !!
It is fun to read my processor runs at 400 ºC ;)
werewolf:/sys/bus/i2c/devices/1-0290# sensors -v
sensors version 2.8.2
werewolf:/sys/bus/i2c/devices/1-0290# cat temp_input1
38000
werewolf:/sys/bus/i2c/devices/1-0290# cat temp_input2
40000
