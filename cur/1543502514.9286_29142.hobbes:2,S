True, but context switches between threads are also usually less costly than
between processes.  Threads also generally use less memory.  Processes and
threads both have their pros and cons though.  I suppose it depends on the
application.

And also because most Unix IPC were developed before threads were even
thought about.  I don't know much about IPC on other systems (like NT) so I
can't comment about it being more advanced.

Poll or select w/ nonblocking IO in server applications can get quite complex.
I've seen examples of identical servers written with process pools, thread
pools, and nonblocking IO(w/ select).  The nonblocking versions were by far
the largest and most complex.  But interestingly enough, they were also the
fastest!
