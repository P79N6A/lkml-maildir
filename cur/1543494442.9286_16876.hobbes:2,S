They work for normal sound stuff but anything that mmap's the buffers seems to
fall over. They are compiled for 2.2.5 but I'm using 2.2.7, although the
changes between then and now really shouldn't have made a difference.

Before I get more e-mails :) , my q3test comment was for the SB Live, I don't
have a Banshee. The SB Live doesn't float with q3test though either. :(
If only I could get my SLI rig rolling with it, I'd be happy.. it only works
with one Voodoo2 it seems..
