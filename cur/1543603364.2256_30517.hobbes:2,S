  Would be nice to change the comment describing the Keyboard core
 support (CONFIG_INPUT_KEYBDEV) in this patch: people (as dumb me)
 may read the help in menuconfig and say:
 I have no USB HID or ADB keyboard...
 Recompile, reboot => no keyboard, no control-alt-del => Reset (fsck...).
  Else it is working here on a P133 with nothing special (std PS2 mouse).
  BTW you just undefine I8042_OVERRIDE_KEYLOCK but this define is
 never used.
  Etienne.
