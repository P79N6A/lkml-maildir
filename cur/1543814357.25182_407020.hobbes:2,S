We've had various screwups and confusions with these things.  I think the
new naming is good - it makes developers _think_ before they use it. 
Instead of "I want to touch all the CPUs, gee that looks right" they'll
have to stop and decide whether they want to access the online, possible or
present ones and then they'll (hopefully) have a little think about what
happens when CPUs migrate between those states.
