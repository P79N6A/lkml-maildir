'lock type' is what i tried to use consistenty.

hehe ;)
singleton wouldnt be enough here as we dont want just one instance of 
this lock type: we want separate types for each array entry. I.e. we 
dont want to unify the lock types (as the common spin_lock_init() call 
suggests), we want to split them along their static addresses.
singleton initialization is what spin_lock_init() itself accomplishes: 
the first call to a given spin_lock_init() will register a 'lock type' 
structure, and all subsequent calls to spin_lock_init() will find this 
type registered already. (keyed by the lockdep-type-key embedded in the 
spin_lock_init() macro)
so - spin_lock_init_split_type() might be better i think and expresses 
the purpose (to split away this type from the other lock types 
initialized here).
Or we could simply get rid of this static-variables special-case and 
embedd a lock_type_key in the runqueue and use 
spin_lock_init_key(&rq->rq_lock_key)? That would unify the 'splitting' 
of types for static and dynamic locks. (at a minimal cost of .data) Hm?
