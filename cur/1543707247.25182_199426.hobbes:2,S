Nothing wrong with helping people. 
Having to put up with the existence of Windows day in and out is the reason I'm still on
an eight-bit encoding.  Sorry for not explaining the REAL problem, but only a partial
problem. I need to support all kinds of clients on Windows with protocols that convey no
character set info. With samba that's no problem. Having to put up with a Unix world running 
ISO-8859-1 (or ISO-8859-15) is another. Ofcourse that means Linux machines also add
to the disturbance by not storing things as unicode. The real obstable is file names, 
everything else including content of files, I can handle (I think). Maybe I'll find a solution
for the filenames too, but usually some hot discussions are needed for the brain to kick
into the right gear. 
I want to switch to UTF-8 to work better with the outside world, but as things are people will 
start to take notice of what OS is running in the shadows when they see the filename problems, and 
start demanding Windows, and ...  You see; I'm not mean; I don't want to do that to them (or myself),
