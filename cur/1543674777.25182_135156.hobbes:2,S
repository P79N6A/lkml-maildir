Hi,
These changes don't even get to login for me. I changed the mm9 command line 
to include init=/bin/sh and got to a prompt. I was able to reproduce an 
enormous number of oopses by issuing:
mount -o remount,rw /
I tried to log it with klogd pointed to a different partition (vfat) but the 
problem segfaults klogd before it commits anything to disc. I'll probably try 
to do it via serial console this evening if nobody else can reproduce this.
Another oddity is that changing my / partition to ext2 in /etc/fstab and 
booting normally (i.e., without init=) doesn't make any difference. If these 
changes are ext3/jbd only, why is my ext3 volume mounted as ext2 still not 
mounting rw?
FWIW, all of my disc's partitions are ext3.
Cheers,
Alistair.
