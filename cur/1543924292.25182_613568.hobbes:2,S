Not yet. And I have access to only an entry-class pSeries server so I
would appreciate it if POWERPC people try the patchset with high-end
servers.
The patchset doesn't use the tricks that the current POWERPC IOMMU use
to improve performance (Anton and Olof told me about them, Thanks!)
. So I might need to modify iova for them.
I think that it's difficult to use some tricks used in the IOMMUs with
the iova even if we modify the iova. If the iova degrades performance,
I think that it would be better to have new IOMMU library code to use
simply a bit map that most of the IOMMUs use.
Another possible factor to degrade performance is that we can't
allocate areas for map_sg at one stroke like some of the IOMMUs do.
We need to allocate an area per sg segment to handle segment boundary.
If it's unacceptable, I guess that there is only one way, LLDs
allocate many sg entries and then the IOMMU splits the sg entryes.
