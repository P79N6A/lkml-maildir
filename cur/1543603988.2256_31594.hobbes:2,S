Just to put in my $0.02 on this...  Compaq systems will span the range 
on this.  The current Wildfire^WGS Series systems have two levels - 
either "local" or "remote", which is just under 3:1 latency vs. local. 
This is all public knowledge, if you care to dig through all the docs. ;)
With the new EV7 systems coming out soon (next year?) every CPU has a 
switch and memory controller built in, so as you add CPUs (up to 64) you 
potentially add levels of latency.  I can't say what they are, but the 
numbers I've been given so far are _much_ better than that.  Just 
another data point. :)
