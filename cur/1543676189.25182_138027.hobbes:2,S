I take that back.
Your sysrq-T woke up syslogd which did a synchronous write which poked
kjournald.  You happened to catch it in mid-commit.  So that's all normal
and sane.
Something is up with netdevice initialisation.  My eth0 (e100) is in a
strange half-there state and won't come up.  Reverting the post-2.5.70 e100
changes does not help.  It's something which went into the tree today I
think.
