Hi!
I've just found that the readlink() call returns a zero-terminated string
when called on an entry under /proc which points to a filename.  The
return value also contains this terminating zero.  For example
readlink("/proc/self/root", buf, many) puts "/\0" to buf and returns 2,
though it should put only "/" to buf and return 1.
I think this simple patch fixes the problem (at least it works ok for me)
