This doesn't explicitely concern linux but:
As an offspring on this issue. You probably know the GPL says somewhere
that "But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which
is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on
the terms of this License,". Does that mean that, strictly speaking, the
GPL forbids the pre-packaging and bundling of systems containing at least
one GPL'ed piece of software and other proprietary programs. That sounds
quite absurd to me, but the "aggregation" clause of the GPL only pre-empts
the rule if the programs are merely distributed together, not as a work.
This must have been resolved somewhere (since a lot of vendors are selling
boxed systems using at least one GPL'ed program somewhere in the system).
Anyone ? 
brgds,
Bjorn
