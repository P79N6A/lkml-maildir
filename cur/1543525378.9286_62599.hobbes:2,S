Just think when one user grabs TV or when an user writes on an NFS server
with a gigabit network. Or think a CPU intensive program that generate a
flood of output on disk (a common strace -o /tmp/o can do exactly that
with a fast enough CPU and a slow enough HD).
I use `cp /dev/zero .` to do that testing just to emulate the effect of
the possible real world scenarios.
`cp /dev/zero .` usually shows the hang because usually CPU is faster than
HD.
