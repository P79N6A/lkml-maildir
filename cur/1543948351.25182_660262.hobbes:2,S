To clarify, the key appears to be file* plus the user-space integer that

I think fork(2) should not be in the above list.  fork(2) duplicates the
kernel's fd, but the user-space integer that represents the fd remains
the same, so you will get EEXIST if you try to add the fd that was
duplicated by fork.
