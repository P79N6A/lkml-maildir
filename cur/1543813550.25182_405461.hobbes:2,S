I'm a bit unclear here.  Are you thinking of a single "do check"
function that bus-specific code and chipset-specific code can hook
into, or individual "do check" functions for various bus-specific and
chipset-specific modules?

Are you suggesting something like the following?
    - The controls that determine how the error checking is done are
      located within the various hardware subsystems.  For instance,
      with PCI parity checking, this would include stuff like setting
      the polling frequency and determining which devices to check.
    - When an error is actually detected, the subsystem that detected
      the error (for instance, PCI) would feed the error information
      to EDAC.  Then EDAC would determine how to respond to the error
      (for instance, push it to userspace or implement the
      userspace-chosen policy (panic/reboot/etc))
