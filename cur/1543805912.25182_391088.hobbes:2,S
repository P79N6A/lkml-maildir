Of course, you can do what I do at work - promote GNU/Linux in _every_
conversation with the users (no matter waht the topic).
Only this week I recovered 1.2GB of pictures from a users home
computer that die running eXtra Problems.
Using Knoppix and a USB stick with the bad drive mounted on hdb (ok,
took 6 'runs' to recover all data) , he was WELL impressed (his wife
even more so...) and started asking questions...
