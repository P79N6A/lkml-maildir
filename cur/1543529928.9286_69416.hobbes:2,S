i actually had this in one version - removed it because i considered it to
be 'hiding' potential bugs.
but these are actually two orthogonal issues here: 1) current->state at
preemption time, and 2) current->state when a copy_*user() function is
called. If 2) is not TASK_RUNNING that i believe is clearly a bug.
in case 1) the process can obviously be non-TASK_RUNNING so the preemption
code should set TASK_RUNNING unconditionally. Simple.
in case 2) the n_tty.c and random.c fixes i posted were fixing real bugs i
believe (they might not be the correct fix though). Eg. one buggy code
path which leads to a stuck process in n_tty.c:
	current->state = TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE;
	...
	copy_from_user(); <=--- causes page fault on user-space page
	  - MM calls into readpage() to fill in the page
	  - readpage tries to get the block index
	  - lowlevel FS code does a getblk()
	  - getblk() does a refill_freelist()
	  - refill_freelist() marks us |= SCHED_YIELD and calls
	    schedule()
potentially causing the process to get 'stuck'. Nothing ever wakes the
process up if the copy_from_user happens prior tty space going below
minimum_to_wake. _typically_ there might be some event waking up that
waitqueue, but i believe it's a volatile concept to call any potentially
rescheduling function with no TASK_RUNNING.
