Sounds like there is some confusion over what CONFIG_ISA means.
I always understood it to mean 'We have ISA slots on this architecture'
regardless of whether theres an ISA style LPC bus.
Its a means of disabling a whole slew of drivers that have no
meaning on a particular platform (in Andi's case, x86-64).
Or did I get confused ?
