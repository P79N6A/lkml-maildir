I'd like to see this, because we want to make the "find the right queue" a
much more expensive operation (no longer some fairly simple mapping from
major number - a more dynamic and general "register this queue for minors
xxxx-yyyy of major zzz").
Doing it just once at open() time allows for that to happen without any
performance downside.
