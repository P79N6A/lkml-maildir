Thanks Tom.  Uploaded as
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/kbuild/kbuild-2.5-sparc64-2.4.18-1.bz2
I will get 2.5.8-pre2 working and upload that then wait for a couple of
days to see if any other arch maintainers have kbuild 2.5 patches.
Then it will be time for Release 2.1 which will be a candidate to go to
Linus.
