However I get this rather unhelpful warning from my installed copy of 
cdrecord.
# cdrecord -prcap dev=/dev/hdc
Cdrecord 2.01a16 (i686-pc-linux-gnu) Copyright (C) 1995-2003 Jörg Schilling
scsidev: '/dev/hdc'
devname: '/dev/hdc'
scsibus: -2 target: -2 lun: -2
Warning: Open by 'devname' is unintentional and not supported.
Linux sg driver version: 3.5.27
Using libscg version 'schily-0.7'
The only other writing programme I'd be interested in at the moment is cdrdao.  
This definitely doesn't like non-SCSI devices, unless there is an updated 
version of this one too that I don't know about.
