The user-mode port of 2.4.13 is available.
defconfig and the packaged kernels are built with CONFIG_PACKET so that 
tcpdump works.
Profiled modules can now be loaded without undefined symbols. 
Fixed a segfault on startup caused by an early unexpected malloc in a 
profiling UML. 
The network backends are now able to cleanly print the commands that 
uml_net runs and their output.
Physical memory protection is now optional and is controlled by the 'jail' 
switch until I figure out how to accomplish memory protection with x86 
segments rather than mprotect.  Clues are gratefully accepted, as I've played
with modify_ldt and have been unenlightened by the results.
UML now respects the TMP/TMPDIR/TEMPDIR environment variables.
