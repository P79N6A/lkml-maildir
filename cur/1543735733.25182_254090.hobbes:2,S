Subject: 2.4.22: wrong return value of do_odirect_fallback

Hi!
In 2.4.22, 
static int do_odirect_fallback(struct file *file, struct inode *inode,
                               const char *buf, size_t count, loff_t *ppos)
it should probably return ssize_t. Can someone check it is fixed
in latest 2.4?
