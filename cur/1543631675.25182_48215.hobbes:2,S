check your init scripts , you might have some entry/error in /etc/rc.d/boot (or where ever you init scripts lie that clears the buffer befor syslogd/klogd get started. (my /etc/init.d/boot does dmesg -c > /var/log/boot.msg so I get the relevant messages during operation without screens of boot up infos, no boot messages in /var/log/messages this way ither.)
