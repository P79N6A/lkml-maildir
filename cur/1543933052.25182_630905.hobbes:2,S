Subject: Some Serial Wacom Tablet devices failing to return from Hibernate/Suspend

A lot of Ubuntu users have noticed troubles with Wacom Serial Tablet
devices (mainly builtin units in Toshiba tablet PCs) refusing to
properly return from ACPI Suspend or Hibernate. See the bug report at:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/
+source/linux-source-2.6.22/+bug/152187
Tom Jaeger there noted that this bug seems to reside in some ACPI
related IRQ handling code for such devices introduced in 2.6.21-rc4,
via a patch to fix Parallel Port IRQs on resumes. You can see his
whole bug report on the issue (including some tentative
shot-in-the-dark patches) at
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9487
This seems to be affecting a fair amount of users, and all of us
active on the bug in the Ubuntu tracker aren't familiar enough with
the ACPI subsystem to create a correct patch for this issue. Is anyone
familiar enough with this area that they can provide some guidance on
the correct way to fix this issue, beyond the quick fix Tom Jaeger
posted?
