I just tried this and it hung again, with nothing in the logs or on
the console.
Pretty wierd.
I just had another hard lockup with sata_mv -> Raid-6, but without LVM.
This is new for me, first time I've seen it lock up without LVM.  I was
resyncing the raid array and running 'badblocks -svn' on it (/dev/md1)
at the same time, and it locked.
I'm going to shelve the Marvell 6081 controller for a while, and go buy
something else...
