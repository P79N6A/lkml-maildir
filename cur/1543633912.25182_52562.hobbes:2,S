I like it! 
This also allows us to remove the anal checking & cleanup
duplicated in each and every driver to be removed.
So your solution will save lots of code at least in all PCI-only
drivers.
I even wrote my own routine that does exactly that, to save the code.
Some people can not use pci_enable_resources(), because sometimes
one of the resources is a PCI-Interface chip, that has a
different driver, which enabled one resource already itself.
So splitting this out alone is already a win.
