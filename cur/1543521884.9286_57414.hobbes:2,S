2000 is a leap year.  A regular one.  On the Gregorian calendar, 1700,
1800, 1900, 2100, 2200 and 2300 are not leap years, but 1600, 2000,
and 2400 are.  Note that when a certain jurisdiction switched to the
Gregorian calendar is, at one level, irrelevant -- it is
perfectly legitimate to refer to the year 400 on the Gregorian
calendar being a leap year, despite the fact that the Gregorian
calendar was invented in the 16th Century AD.
