The PNPBIOS spec doesn't seem to say explicitly either, although the
examples there also use uppercase.  So it'd probably be nicer if we
used uppercase everywhere in Linux.  Unfortunately, we have the legacy
of the kernel using lowercase in PNP IDs, and there are userspace things
like modprobe aliases that depend on that.

I think reposting the patch will be better.  But I would split this
up into a patch per file, so they can go through the usual maintainers,
and I think we should wait a bit (see below).

Nice work debugging that problem!  I would include that synopsis in
the changelog, because it helps people who trip over the same problem
and are looking for a solution, and it helps people who want to
understand why the change was made.
IMO, part of the problem here is that there is a single PNP ID
namespace, but it's shared between the PNP core and the ACPI core.
And PNP doesn't emit uevents, so in this case, we're using ACPI
uevents to load a PNP driver.  The ACPI uevents will be uppercase
(which matches the IDs in ACPI drivers), but the IDs in PNP drivers
are typically lowercase (which matches the strings in
/sys/devices/pnp*/*/id).
I started trying to untangle this last year, but I didn't get far
enough to be comfortable that I wouldn't break existing userspace
stuff.  Maybe it's time to resurrect that work.
The RTC problem is not really a regression; it sounds like this is
a long-standing problem.  Given that, I'd like to have a clearer
idea of how to clean up the namespace and uevent issues before we
go changing all the PNP drivers.
