Ok. For SMP-safety, it's important that any architecture that can't do 
this needs to _share_ the same spinlock (on SMP only, of course) that it 
uses for the bitops. 
It would be good (but perhaps not as strict a requirement) if the atomic 
counters also use the same lock. But that is probably impossible on 
sparc32 (since it has a per-counter "lock"-like thing, iirc). So doing a 
cmpxchg() on an atomic_t would be a bug.
