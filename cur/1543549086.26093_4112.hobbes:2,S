Hmm..
Why would this not have happened for a module?
I agree that the thing looks fishy. But this is not new code, and it has
worked previously. What changed?

Umm, reading the code it looks more like the proper test would be
	if (!tpnt->present)
		return;
because if "present == 0", then the host not only won't have had the proc
entry added, it also won't have been added to the "scsi_hosts" list - so
the "remove the adapter from the linked list" step is the wrong way around
too. No?
(That linked list implementation, btw, is the worst possible list
implementation I have ever seen. Ugh).
And again, why did this not show up with modules? 
Curious.
