  Good grief, what monster hardware...
  Those are (of course) system results which give some impression of
  how much users can pull out of the box.
  Trying to make them a bit more comparable, scaling the number with
  the number of processors:
  Zeus     12x600MHz IBM RS64-III     7288 SpecWEB99  ~ 607 SpecWEB99/CPU
  Zeus     4x375MHz IBM Power3-II     2175 SpecWEB99  ~ 544 SpecWEB99/CPU
  TUX 1.0  8x700MHz Pentium-III-Xeon  6387 SpecWEB99  ~ 798 SpecWeb99/CPU
  IIS      2x800MHz Pentium-III-Xeon  1060 SpecWEB99  ~ 530 SpecWEB99/CPU
  IIS      1x700MHz Pentium-III-Xeon   971 SpecWEB99  = 971 SpecWEB99/CPU
  Ok, more workers to do the thing, but each can achieve a bit less in
  the IBM/Zeus case than TUX 1.0.   The smaller IBM/Zeus test case with
  older and slower processors yields almost as good results per CPU as
  the big one.   CPU clock speed increase has been lost into inter-CPU
  collisions ?  (that is, bad scaling)
  The IIS results are also interesting in their own.  Single-CPU IIS
  yields impressive PER CPU result, but adding second CPU is apparently
  quite useless excercise.   Hmm... Can't be..  As if that DUAL CPU
  result is actually run in single-CPU mode.  The difference can
  directly be explained by the clock rate difference..
  (Surely the runners of that test *can't* make such an elementary
   mistake!)
  To be able to compare apples and apples, I would like to see single,
  and dual CPU SpecWEB99 results with TUX.  Then that apparent 20%
  better "per CPU result" of the single-CPU IIS could not be explained
  away with SMP inter-CPU communication overhead/collisions.
