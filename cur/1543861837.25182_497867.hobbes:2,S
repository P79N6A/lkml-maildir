To clarfiy my understanding of this issue:
A device MAY implement ib_req_notify_cq by updating
a location directly from user mode. Any of the techniques
that apply to other user allocated objects, such as 
the Send Queue, can be applied here.
Even those the proposed changes would be about as
low impact and benign as possible, the fact that there
are valid solutions without an API changes leans heavily
towards using those solutions.
