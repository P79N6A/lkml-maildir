Yes, it does.  By default the module support lets you install and
deinstall modules manually.  The module loader support is for
automatic loading of modules on demand, which is great if that's how you
want your system set up, but in many cases you just want the necessary
modules loaded at boot time and dynamic loading of modules during run
time just gets in the way.

Enable "experimental options" in the overall config first.
