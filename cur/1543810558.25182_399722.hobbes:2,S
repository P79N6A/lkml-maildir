which I totally agree with ...
but a) how is that related to _having_ a tool to
check for duplicate includes, and b) how is it
related to removing duplicate includes in general?
let me give a simple example here:
 #include <linux/pm.h>
 #include <linux/sched.h>
 #include <linux/proc_fs.h>
-#include <linux/pm.h>
do you think the second one is really desired?

no, sorry, doesn't help here ...
nevertheless thanks,
