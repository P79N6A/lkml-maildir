Thanks for the quick response, John.

I'll try that next.

I don't think so.  I'm not sure how to tell.  Running the following:
prev=0
while true; do
    cur=`cat /proc/interrupts| grep timer|cut -d' ' -f 6`
    (( diff = $cur - $prev ))
    echo $diff; prev=$cur
    sleep 1
done 
gives interrupt count differences that are between 1003 and 1222 per (rough) 
second.  The mean is 1016 with a std deviation of 16.  Running the same thing 
on another machine -- one without clock problems -- yields similar values.
Is there a better way to measure this?
Thanks
 Shawn
