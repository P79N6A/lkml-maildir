The 1-1 area using mappings for 2MB pages right? So it uses a virtual 1-1 
area. It already has a virtual mapping.
What we do for virtual memmap here is also use 2MB pages but order the 
pages a bit different so that they provide a linear memory map.
So the number of TLBs in use stays the same. There are a few additional 
higher level page table pages that are needed to provide the alternate 
view that generates the linear mapping but that is just a couple of pages.
