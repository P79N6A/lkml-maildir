The NTFS vendor is identical to the DOS vendor. Therefore it has access
to current, correct and complete documentation and can control and test
changes on dedicated test systems before bugs hits users seriously.
In case of filesystems (like here), "hitting the user seriously" means
"loosing the whole filesystem. Go and look for a recent backup.".
