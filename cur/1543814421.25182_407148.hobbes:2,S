There is a much more reliable way to check this. Use the profiling
registers to check the instruction issue count before/after the I/O and
you'll know if its something like SMM or just a bus stall.
I can believe the bus stall because some devices will queue a large FIFO
of data for the disk and the status read may require flushing it all
out.
