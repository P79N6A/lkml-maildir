Thank you for doing it, Daniel. SOMEBODY needs to do it. You elected to.
Stephan is attempting to help you do it right. (If he is who I believe him
to be
(there can't be TWO can there?) he's had plenty of experience listening to
the sort of pundits you want to reach complain about flakey press releases.
Um, I've seen this litany before - in almost the same order on BIX. {^_-}

This is indeed "Not A Good Thing" (tm). Somebody should bite the bullet
and be there to answer questions. (I'm not volunteering. I don't know
enough to answer the questions cogently. But I did make one minor
successful kernel hack to keep one of my machines working past Y2K
when its BIOS would lockup on boot with a divide by zero error.)

If you refer to a trademarked item mark it so and place the usual

The phrasing is inconsistent. Cleaning that piece up is good training for
engineers as well as PR authors. (English is my primary language - heck
only people language - and I am still learning to use it correctly. If you
spend
the time now it will be a BIG win come time to look for a job. I turned down
a few employment prospects when I was in the hiring loop because they
could not express themselves clearly.)

And if got lost. That should tell you something. Perhaps something like
"    *Advanced interface support for USB, FireWire, and AGP!"
Then place any expostulatory text indented under that as complete sentences.
This treates the bulleted items as "titles". Your target audience dispises
incomplete sentences and clunky grammar. (And do rest assured that folks
like Jerry Pournelle have posted some REAL clunkers, worse than anything
you did) on BIX for our chuckles.)

Enh, one COULD argue that a kernel is an unusually low level application.
It might be a good idea to skip "product comparisons" and stick with a
positive tone. We're not running a political campaign here.

Please be assured we're not making that mistake. But in as much as it is a
learning experience for you we're trying to give you your effort's worth of
help to make it something you can point to with pride in the future.
