I could not find anything regarding $SUBJECT.
Next week I will be getting the Netgear WG602 (Access point),
WG511 (PCMCIA  card) and WG311 (PCI card), all of which are
54 Mbs 802.11g compliant.
I will be able to test the PCI card on both 2.4 and 2.6.
The PCMCIA card only under 2.4
(My old (1999) via-based laptop doesn't like 2.6 but that's another
story)
