The environment that this senerio would be most likly to be used in would
not be using a Linux box for the NFS server, instead it would be using
something like a Network appliance (or their higher end competitor,
Auspecs or domwthing like that). These boxes run their own OS, have their
own filesystem and are heavily tuned (raid for disks, large amounts of
static ram to buffer writes to, etc). They are also not cheap, the one I
am using at my web farm here runs ~$60,000. not having the ability to use
any capabilities for files residing on this system would be a drawback.

"If users are made to understand that the system administrator's job is to
make computers run, and not to make them happy, they can, in fact, be made
happy most of the time. If users are allowed to believe that the system
administrator's job is to make them happy, they can, in fact, never be made
happy."
