The  term  "virtual"  has  a  very  specific  in  OO,  esp.   in  C++.
Unfortunately, this word isn't a  very faithful description of what it
means.  Java uses the keyword "abstract" for what is "virtual" in C++.
This is much more appropriate.
And "virtual function table", "vptr", "vtable" are also specific terms
in OO which  refer to implementation details of the  run-time of an OO
language.   To  you,  this  shouldn't  be anything  new.   A  "virtual
function table" is just an  array of pointers to functions.  It serves
essentially the same purpose  as the super_operations structure in the
Linux  kernel.  Instead  of having  to building  the table  (in source
code, not run-time) yourself, the  compiler of C++ and any OO language
would do  it for you  automatically, thereby saving typing  effort and
avoiding trivial typos.
