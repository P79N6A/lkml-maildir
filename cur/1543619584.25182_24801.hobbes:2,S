heh, after I've read that you managed to boot 2.4 + rmap in a machine with
just 4 MB after tweaking some table sizes I thought about devoting some
time to identify those tables and making them options in make *config, with
even a nice CONFIG_TINY, like you said 8)
I'll eventually do this, and I'd appreciate if people send me suggestions
of tables/data structures that can be trimmed/reduced. Yeah, I'll take a
look at the .config files used in the embedded distros.
