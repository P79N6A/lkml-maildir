Gaak.
The guys at 
http://www.cidr-report.org
 are only showing 130K or so prefixes in
the global routing table (and estimate that it could be kicked down to 90K or
so with better CIDR aggregation.
I won't ask what sort of totally martian network design is leading to a routing
table of millions of entries - even the "stick PMTU info into a host route" trick
should expire routes to hosts you're not talking to, and you're probably going
to be wanting a load balancer if you're talking to hundreds of thousands of
machines at the same time.....
