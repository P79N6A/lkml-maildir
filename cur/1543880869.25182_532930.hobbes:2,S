Subject: [PATCH 1/3] kswapd: use reclaim order in background reclaim
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

When an allocator has to dip below the low water mark for a
zone, kswapd is awoken to start background reclaim.  The highest
order of these dipping allocations are accumulated on the zone.
With this patch kswapd uses this hint to force reclaim at that
order via balance_pgdat().
