	I am sure they are not realistic when speaking of the internet
	connexions. But not everybody is using WEB on the internet. Here,
	for example, we have no connexion to the internet, but a lot
	of clients (around 1000) are connected (can connect) to our
	intranet servers, where much useful information can be found.
	I have not done any statistics, but I am quite sure that they
	are heavily used.
