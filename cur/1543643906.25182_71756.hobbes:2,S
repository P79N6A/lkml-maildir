Just tell me which ones to test and I'll happily throw them in too.

My laptop which does all the testing has only one hard disk

It's the same disk. These are the correct values after I've fixed all known
problems in contest. I need someone else to try contest with a different disk.
Helpful? This is all new so it will take a while for _anyone_ to understand
exactly what's going on I'm sure. Since we haven't had incremental benchmarks
till now, who knows what it was that made IO full mem drop from 146 to 74 in the
first place?
