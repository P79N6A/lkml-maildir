I'm just wondering if anything is happening with kbuild 2.5, since I think it
makes sense to put it in.
There seem to be a number of fairly well known developers in favour of it
(Robert Love, Richard Gooch, Mike Fedyk, Paul Mackerras, Alan Cox, Andrea
Arcangeli, Dave Jones, for a few), and I don't see any major objections to it in
the archives.
According to my googling, the only comment Linus has had on the topic since
January is this (the typos are his):
"I'm hoping we can get there in small steps, rather than a big traumatic
merge. I'd love to just try to merge it piecemeal.
Especially as I don't find the existign system so broken."
Keith--any way you can send it in piecemeal like he wants?
Chris
