Some time ago I sent a patch for the select() systemcall to return
if the last fd was closed. If select() specifies more than one fd, then
staying in select is valid, but if there is no more fd left to wait on,
select() should return I think. I don't know what standards say here
or other Unix do in that case, so I did't have a good reason for the patch
and it was ignored.
The patch was for 2.4, but 2.6 is the same and poll() as well.
