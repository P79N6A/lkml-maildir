The other caveat which is worth adding is that currently, the UB
device only supports a single LUN.  Some devices, most notably USB
readers that support multiple types of compact flash/secure
digital/smart media/et.al., and the PalmOne T5 PDA export multiple
LUN's.  
(I was scratching my head for a while trying to figure out why the T5
documentation claimed that you could access both the internal flash
memory as well as the Secure Digital external memory via the USB
interface until I realized it was because I was using the UB driver,
and it didn't support multiple LUN's.)
