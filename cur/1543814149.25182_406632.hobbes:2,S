hmm ... not sure about that, what 'we' need is a way
to move between pid spaces and to control processes
in a child space from the parent process ...
nevertheless I don't think we have a problem with
schizophrenic processes if they have a somewhat sane
*G* interface/view into both spaces ...

I take that as migration of a 'container' from one
system to another, not as 'migration' between spaces
I don't understand what you mean here, please elaborate

again, for what would I need a 'second' or 'third' pid
value for a process either on demand or permanent for
handling or migration?

I have the feeling this is going into a completely wrong
direction, what am I missing here?
