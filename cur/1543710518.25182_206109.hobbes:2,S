Please retry without sonypi. I have nearly the same crappy notebook (fx705)
and when I tried sonypi, I discovered that it prevented the VIA audio from
registering because the IO controller was within the audio's IO space.
And it seems you've got the same problem: sonypi @1080-1084 and VIA @1000-10FF :
