from talking to people working with gigE i gather 16M is not nearly enough
to do the tricks needed to take advantage of gigE in it's present state. 
also, for hard data, an Alpha4000 w/ 512MB RAM does a bit over 80Mbps on
100bT just shoving data from /dev/zero. from my knowledge of crusoe, i
gather it's patethic as a bit mover when compared with an axp system.
on pratical reasons, why do you need 1Gbps on such a small device ? it's not
like you can actually generate data that fast :)
a 100bT *good* chipset (dirt cheap compared to gigE) and a reasonable 
amount of mem (>32M) would probably be faster and render better results

"Some people have told me they don't think a fat penguin really embodies the
grace of Linux, which just tells me they have never seen a angry penguin 
charging at them in excess of 100mph. They'd be a lot more careful about 
what they say if they had." -- Linus Torvalds
