I'll also suggest you stop talking out of your arse, there are no
aliens in Area 51 either Jon and man did walk on the moon, refuting
the crap you post takes more time than fixing X...
Coverity scan is all of X (clients, libraries, server, apps) not just
the X server, it is also against the old 6.9 tree not the modular
tree, so it never gets anything fixed as that tree is dead. We are
working with coverity to scan modular instead.
My current X server hasn't any network sockets open by default.
Your ideas to fix X didn't result in patches to fix X, ideas are great
we all have ideas, patches are better, for some reason we don't all
have patches.
We are fixing X, you are not.
Dave.
