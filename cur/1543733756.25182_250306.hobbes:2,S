	I'm sure others here have far better examples, but one post to the 
netfilter-devel list last December provided an example of a firewall that 
could process 580kpps with netfilter/conntrack turned off.  Granted, the 
post noted that adding netfilter brought that down to 450kpps, and adding 
conntrack on top of that brought it down to 295kpps, but all three of 
those numbers are well over the claimed 100kpps.
	Cheers,
	- Bill
