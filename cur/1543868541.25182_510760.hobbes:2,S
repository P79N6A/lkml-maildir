When someone uses a term that can mean more than one possible thing and then
uses the fact that it's true for one meaning to argue that it must be true
for the other, what else can you do other than point out that the term they
are using has multiple meanings?

Nobody is arguing otherwise. Nobody is saying "you don't have to comply with
the GPL". We're saying that the GPL doesn't mean what people think it means.
In some cases it's because of the GPL's wording, but in other cases it's
because the GPL cannot set its own scope.

Right. And all the cases we are talking about are mere aggregation (that is,
they do not create derivative works).

The issue is about what the license *means* and what its scope is. For
example, if the license said "if you ever use a work that is subject to this
license, you must place every work you create after that under the license",
that would obviously not be enforceable. The question of the *scope* of the
license is critical, and you can't read the license to understand its scope.

Well, there are certainly cases where you can. Necessary step, first sale,
and fair use all provide possible situations where you can copy a
copyrighted work without complying with the license. But more generally, the
argument is over the scope of the license.
The GPL doesn't restrict the distribution of mere aggregations not because
the authors felt this was a wise decision, but because it *can't*. That is
outside the GPL's power. So the question of what's a "mere aggregation" is a
legal question about the scope of the GPL, and you have to look at law and
case law to understand it, not the text of the GPL.
The GPL grants you the permission to modify and distribute the original work
if you distribute the source of the original work. The GPL also puts certain
requirements on the distribution of derivative works. This is, as far as I
can tell, the maximum of the scope it can have.
You are trying to cram this in a simple yes or no box, and it just doesn't
fit. There are questions nobody knows the answers to (such as what rights
you need to distribute a derivative work or whether compiling code makes a
translation).
