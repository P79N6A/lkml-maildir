For what it's worth, I have exactly the same thing happen with 2.2.5:  an 
attempt to make any connection to a specific location from any machine on 
my intranet fails for about two minutes, and netstat shows no 
problems.  After two minutes, everything is fine.  During that two-minute 
period, almost every other request goes through without 
problems.  (Sometimes I'll have two or even three locations that are hosed, 
but they appear to be hosed independently because the first to freeze is 
the first to thaw, and so forth.)
The really bad news is that it's an intermittent problem, with absolutely 
NO predictability, and by the time I can bring enough tools to bear on the 
problem, it's "cured."  It happens when the clients in use are Linux, 
Windows, or Macintosh.  It can happen in any hour of the day.
The good news is that it happens so seldom that I haven't found it 
necessary to worry about spending a lot of time on it.  It happens once 
every three-four days.
