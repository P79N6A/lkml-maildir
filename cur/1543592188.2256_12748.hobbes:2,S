In an attempt to nudge you back towards your previous opinion: consider
a system-wide spool or tmp filesystem. It would be nice to be able to
add in a few extra volumes for a busy period but then shrink it down
again when usage returns to normal. In the absence of the ability to
shrink a live filesystem, storage management becomes a much harder job.
You can't throw in a spare volume or two where it's needed without
careful thought because you'll be ratchetting up the space on that one
filesystem without being able to change your mind and reduce it again
later. You'll end up with stingy storage admins who refuse to give you
a bunch of extra filesystem space for a while because they can't get it
back again afterwards.
