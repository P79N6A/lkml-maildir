As I said above, all these problems are solveable. You can solve 
these problems easily by making sure your interfaces handle things 
correctly. There are ways to normalise differences between compilers, 
and compatibility tests are what you should use to check this.
Take XFree86 4.0 for instance. They support binary loadable modules 
and they don't have these problems.

Sorry, I completely disagree here. Backwards compatibility in Windows 
9x was a choice that Microsoft made to sell the OS (and it worked; 
OS/2 would have killed NT otherwise). 
The binary driver model has *absolutely* nothing to do with the 
stability of the Windows platform, and given the amount of respect I 
have for you, I feel you should understand this quite well. The 
Windows 9x platform is unstable because the foundation it was built 
on (the 16-bit Windows 3.1 kernel) was not well designed to begin 
with. Win32 services were wrapped around an inherently archaic, 16-
bit kernel. Windows NT is a totally different story, and a hell of a 
lot more stable than Windows 9x.
Windows NT supports binary drivers, but you didn't say that binary 
drivers killed Windows NT? OS/2 has binary drivers, and OS/2 is 
probably one of the most stable OS'es around (Warp Server for e-
Business is incredibly stable). One reason why OS/2 is so much more 
stable than Windows NT is because IBM takes binary compatibility and 
conformance/regression testing *very* seriously (I know, because we 
license our technology to IBM).

It got nothing to do with this. It is all about what mechanisms can 
be put in place to allow for better compatibility with the vast 
number of devices that Linux supports. A *real* operating system is 
just not going to be able to survive unless some procedures and 
policies are put in place to ensure future compatibility with legacy 
hardware.

You miss one very important point which you did bring up briefly as 
as something against binary portable drivers. Pure source drivers are 
adversely affected by compiler compatibilty concerns, and unless the 
user is bulding the updated sources with the *exact* same compiler 
revision and kernel source code, you don't really have any idea 
whether it will work. It should work, but how many times have you 
seen compatibility problems where something should work (and did work 
before) but a minor change, compiler bug or something else stopped it 
from working in a future revision?
This is one reason why when IBM does builds of OS/2, if there are 
updates to legacy components those components get built with the 
compiler version the component was originally built with. If the 
component was written 5 years ago with MSC 6.0c, it is re-built with 
MSC 6.0c for the latest Warp Server for e-Business platform. Why? 
Because that is one way to ensure repetable results.

Sure I would like to see binary portable drivers in the Linux kernel 
so we can better support our products (of which some don't fit at all 
well with Open Source). But that is not what this is about. If I need 
to solve this problem, we will create our own Linux distribution 
(they only way we can actually ensure compatibility anyway). We 
probably will end up doing that anyway.
I am more interested in the future stability of Linux. I want to see 
Linux succeed, but it needs better support for compatibility and 
regression testing IMHO.

What has this got to do with vendors? NE2000 compatible boards are 
the most common boards around. Sure vendors don't want to support 
them anymore, because they would always rather sell you a new network 
card. That is how they make money.
But Linux *should* fully support those boards. Surely there are lots 
of people who have those boards, and proper testing and certification 
can be done regardless of whether a vendor submits NE2000 compatibile 
hardware or not.
Imagine how bad the compatibile of XFree86 would be if no-one 
bothered to ensure that the latest servers work properly on the old 
S3 Vision chipsets? You can be sure no-one at S3 wants to help 
support those boards, because they would much rather upgrade you to a 
Savage2000. But developers on the XFree86 list have those boards, and 
do reguarly test them to ensure backwards compatibility.

You do yourself no favours when you try to force people who want to 
help Linux grow, to be forced into a model that is fraught with 
compatibity issues. This is the whole crux of the matter. You are 
totally against the concept of building support for binary portable 
modules, because it might enable companies to develop proprietry 
drivers for Linux? What about the fact that there are a ton of 
positive benefit for compatibility issues in doing this? Are you 
willing to jeapordise the future of Linux, just to stop my company 
from being able to build binary portable modules? I didn't realise 
that what I do has such a tremendous impact on the Linux community...
Why not look at the substance of my post, and respond to some of the 
technical issues for why binary portable modules can help to make 
Linux a much more compatible product? All you have done in your 
response is try to downplay my reasoning by saying that I have some 
hidden agenda to get binary portable modules into Linux so I can sell 
my products.
