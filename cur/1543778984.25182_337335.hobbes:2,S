Except in extreme circumstances (there's some horrible kludgery in the
NFS code), you don't.  Just store a dentry pointer to begin with; it's
easy to map from dentry to inode.
In addition to files with multiple names, you can have files with no
names, made by the usual Unix trick of deleting a file after opening it.
The NFS kludgery is required by the short-sighted design of the NFS
protocol.  Don't emulate it, or you will be lynched by a mob of angry
kernel developers with torches and pitchforks.
