How many systems of this type are there in the world? $52 billion per year  
from *one* system? Can't be all that many.
In any case, for a yearly $52 billion dollar made by one system, yes, 3.3  
million dollars is trivial. Peanuts. Toy money. Down in the noise.
Or, to put it another way, 0.00004 %.
Yes, 33 minutes fsck *is* tolerable in that situation if that person isn't  
insane.
