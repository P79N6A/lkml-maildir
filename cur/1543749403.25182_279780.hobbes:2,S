The basic reason is that I think it's important to know exactly what
you're getting into when you include a header, especially when you're
authoring new headers.  
That said, it doesn't appear that asm/page.h is a header that causes any
real problems.  In any case, when there are variables that need to be
created based on Kconfig parameters, I believe the "correct" thing to do
is make a Kconfig variable.  But, that is a separate conversation. :)

No.  But, I do think that most of the very basic VM structures do, as it
stands.  That's limited to struct page, zone, and pgdat as I see it
now.

One thing I'd like to point out is that I don't necessarily think that
the normal foo.c user should see any change.  They can still include
mmzone.h for the same stuff, but *inside* the headers, there's some more
organization.  Here's an example from a new header that I'm working on
after shifting the headers around.
#include <asm/page-consts.h>      /* for PAGE_SHIFT */
#include <asm/addr-convert.h>     /* for __pa() */
#include <linux/structpage.h>     /* for struct page */
#include <linux/sparse-consts.h>  /* for NR_MEM_SECTIONS... */
#include <linux/sparse-structs.h> /* for mem_section[] */
The dependencies aren't very twisted at all.  In fact, I don't think any
of those are deeper than two.  More importantly, I never have to cope
with 'struct page;' keeping me from doing arithmetic.

I agree that I'm probably getting a bit carried away.  But, I don't
really see the harm in having both high-level headers and more finely
grained ones.  You could even think of the finely grained ones as
internal only.
In my example above the header is called linux/sparse.h.  It end up
including linux/sparse-consts.h and linux/sparse-structs.h.  So, any .c
file users can just include linux/sparse.h and forget about it.  But, if
any crazy header authors need either of the components in a different
order, they can have it.
