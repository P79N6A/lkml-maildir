You have gotten a bunch of thoughts on this, I will just say that plain 
old "fdisk -l" saved somewhere safe is probably all you need, in human 
readable format. Doesn't do you any good now, but all the complicated 
schemes discussed don't thrill me, I want to be able to see this, and 
recovery by partition table manual rebuild is so rare I would rather do 
it by hand than trust some software I rarely use.
