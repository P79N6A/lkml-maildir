Hi Pete,

mm->free_area_cache can't cause any problems on s390x because it isn't
used. The idea behind mm->free_area_cache is to speed up the search in
get_unmapped_area/arch_get_unmapped_area. But s390x defines its own
version of arch_get_unmapped_area in arch/s390x/kernel/sys_s390.c
which doesn't start the search at mm->free_area_cache.

This patch is severly broken. It wouldn't even compile.
To make sure I retested the kernel 2.5.64 with the patches I sent to
this list and ipled a 31 bit userland successfully.
