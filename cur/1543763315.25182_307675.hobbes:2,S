That is not really a fair categorization of the thread. Hubertus and I 
did try to explain what CKRM classes are. As the last parts of the 
thread show, it was the choice of names that you disagreed with.

Except for the Kernel Summit talk (slides of which were very brief),
you have access to the very same presentations on the ckrm website.

Have you read Section 2 of the
	
http://ckrm.sourceforge.net/downloads/ckrm-ols04-paper.pdf
There the terms class, classtype, resource controllers and 
classification engine have all been explained. If you continue to have 
trouble understanding what these mean, we'd be happy to go over it once 
more. Perhaps we should try a twiki type site or come up with a specific 
set of doubts that need to be addressed.

Undoubtedly so. However, workload management middleware developers don't 
seem to have a history of actively participating in LKML for useful 
features so its left to the likes of us to determine what *would* be 
useful and then go build it if it makes sense and is acceptable to the 
community.

Doing fair-share scheduling is indeed the ultimate goal of CKRM. But 
using that characterization *alone* will not, in my opinion, be 
sufficient to explain what are classes, classtypes etc.

Thanks for the links. Yes, some of these are useful in understanding the 
utility of fair-share scheduling and may even help in creating better 
"controllers" in CKRM-speak.
