The other approach will not have any remote ptes at that point. Why would 
there be a coherency issue?

No. It only has to lock the affected range. Remote page faults can occur 
while another part of the address space is being invalidated. The 
complexity of locking is up to the user of the mmu notifier. A simple 
implementation is satisfactory for the GRU right now. Should it become a 
problem then the lock granularity can be refined without changing the API.

Still not sure what we are talking about here.
