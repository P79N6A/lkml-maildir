	BTW, what the hell is that?
/*
 * hwgraph_bdevsw_get - returns the fops of the given devfs entry.
*/
struct file_operations * 
hwgraph_bdevsw_get(devfs_handle_t de)
{
        return(devfs_get_ops(de));
}
	It's arch/ia64/sn/io/hcl.c.  The funny thing being, the thing
you will get from devfs_get_ops() will _not_ be struct file_operations *.
And that's aside of the fact that any use of that function is very
likely to be racy as hell.  Sigh...
