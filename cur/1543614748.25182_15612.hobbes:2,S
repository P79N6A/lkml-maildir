Marcelo:  I have had no reports of problems with the PnP BIOS
driver, so I believe it can go in.  You can get it at:
   
http://panopticon.csustan.edu/thood/pnpbios.html
Note that for now the driver is only to be used for system
configuration using the lspnp and setpnp utilities.  How to
interface this driver with other drivers is a matter that
may require further consideration.
Thanks
