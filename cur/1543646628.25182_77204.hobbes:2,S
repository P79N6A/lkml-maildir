Hard-coding it to get load-balancing isn't terrible, and when the qlogic
driver works, the way I've got my controllers setup right now, it will
work just like powerpath, etc. There are no *ghosted* luns ATM, just the
*other luns*. Only when a failure occurrs, do I want them to be able to
be addressed down the alternate path. Since Target Reset is on, and the
driver is aware of all LUNs, it should allow the failover to occur. I'm
going to do some testing right now and see anyway, after adding
sparselun for the STK array.

Currently things are more hard-coded than I'd like, but we're redundant
in many ways anyway. I'm going to see if the sparseluns bits at least
lets it keep working, but then I'll see if it actually does keep the
luns in more AVT time, than in operational time.
