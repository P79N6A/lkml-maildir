Long lived and memory intensive cloned or forked tasks will often
[but far from always :(] want to be put on another memory controller
from their siblings.
On workloads where there are lots of short lived ones (some bloated
java programs), the load balancer should normally detect this and
cut the balance-on-fork/clone.
Of course there are going to be cases where this fails. I haven't
seen significant slowdowns in tests, although I'm sure there would
be some at least small regressions. Have you seen any? Do you have
any tests in mind that might show a problem?
Thanks,
Nick
