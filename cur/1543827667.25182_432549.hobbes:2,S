No problem.  It didn't take long for ext3 - it won't take long for ext4.
First, you have developers and some enthusiasts using it.
Then, you get the thousands of people who like living
on the edge using ext4. As soon as it doesn't have bad known bugs.
Then some distros pick it up, wanting to be first with
large-disk support.
After that, it is considered "harmless".
If a break in on-disk layout is useful, then the time is now while
a new fs is introduced anyway.  It could be 7 years to the next chance.
