That one exactly... I don't recall calling it a typo, though ;-) I guess 
that is more a relic from when the only lib routines were libz ones and 
we called the lib to be linked libz.a....
There is a simular entry in arch/ppc/boot/openfirmware/Makefile... 
removing the z helped over there as well (don't recall exactly, I'm at 
work now... ) (not that I dare booting Linus's 2.5 tree on my build 
machine, it's falling apart even with stable software....  ;-(
