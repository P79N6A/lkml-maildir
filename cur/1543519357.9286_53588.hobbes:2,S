 Huh?  Contrary to popular misconceptions, the year 2000 is actually the
LAST year of this millennium.  After Dec 31 1999 we will have completed
1999 full years.  Jan 1 2001 is the first day of the next millennium.  
  Most desk calendars have a couple of pages on this subject hidden at
the bottom of the stack.
 Anyway, looking forward to 2.4 before the end of the millennium.  ;)
