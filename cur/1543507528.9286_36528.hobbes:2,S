Hi!
With xanim the sound was OK, but with my wavplay it wasn´t. So I looked
with strace what that program does in another way than mine. And I
looked at the sources and modified my program until I got good sound.
So now I have a solution for the problem from application side:
      int kkk=16;
       ioctl(sound, SNDCTL_DSP_SETFRAGMENT, &kkk);
If kkk=8 the sound is like before. 
With kkk=16 it seems to be OK. Greater values are also OK.
With kkk=4 or less, the sound becomes more dirty.
So you can look at this in the driver so that it sets these things
right.
Greetings, Michael
