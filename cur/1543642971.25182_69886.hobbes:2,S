Hi,
 I am reducing the memory usage of vmlinux used in embedded
system ( I am using Montavista Hardhat linux 2.4.2 kernel) . 
I am able to reduce some by allocating lesser memory to caches
(page_cache, buffer cache etc.. )
What all other areas I can look for reducing the memory usage. 
Please cc me as I am not subscribed to list
Thanks
sanjay
