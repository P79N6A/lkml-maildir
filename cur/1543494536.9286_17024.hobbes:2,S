That was my first suspicion. The problem is, the hardware in question
was running RedHat 4.1 without any problem whatsoever for about a
month before I decided to upgrade, and is quite happy to run RH 4.1
again after receiving that oops. As a result, I have to suspect that
the memory's fine...
I will also add that the CD's fine since I've been able to install
from it onto four different systems without problem, but on the one I
most want to install on, it just don't work !!!

How about two kernel compiles in parallel, one for 2.0.36 and the
other for 2.2.6, which I did the day before 2.2.7 was released on the
hardware in question, although under RH 4.1 as stated above, and with
kernel 2.0.33 if I remember right - I'm not on the machine in question
at the moment, so can't refer to its logs...
Best wishes from Riley.
