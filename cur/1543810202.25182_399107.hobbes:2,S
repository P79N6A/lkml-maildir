well, my point is just that we don't know yet
so we should not favor one over the other, just
because somebody did it like that and it didn't
hurt :)

well, Linux-VServer uses a state called 'setup'
which allows to change all kinds of things before
the guest can be entered, this state is changed
as the last operation of the setup, which in turn
drops all the capabilities and makes the guest
visible to the outside ...
works quite well and seems to be free of those
races you mentioned ...

btw, maybe it's just me, but would it be possible
to do the email quoting like this:
