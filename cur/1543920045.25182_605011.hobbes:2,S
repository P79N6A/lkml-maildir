More precisely - change below from git-block.patch update
caused that pages are not deallocated at all.

clone->bi_size is zero here now, so crypt_free_buffer_pages will not
work correctly (previously there was count of processed bytes).
But because it seems that bio cannot be processed partially now, we can
simplify crypt_free_buffer_pages to always remove all allocated pages.
