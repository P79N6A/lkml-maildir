RTFS and you'll see.  Individual fs generally knows how to check if it
would be immediately unhappy with given image (not all types do, BTW).
Exact form of checks depends on fs type; for crying out loud, there's
not even a promise that they are mutually exclusive!
Read the fucking source.  Read through the code that "chooses" fs type
of root fs.  Look at it.  Then use whatever you have between your ears.
