Subject: [PATCH] Driver Subsystem: Replace abused semaphore
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/10/20/460

Use completion instead of the abused semaphore. Semaphores are slower
and trigger owner conflicts during semaphore debugging.
Signed-off-by: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>
