Resume from RAM on a ThinkPad T43p is now happy with Thomas' periodic
tick fix - the most unusable aspect of that for me had been how slow
repeat keys were to start repeating, but that's all fine now.
But suspend to RAM still hanging, unless I "chmod a-x /usr/sbin/docker"
on SuSE 10.2: docker undock tries to unregister /sys/block/sr0 and hangs:

This comes from Oliver's commit 94bebf4d1b8e7719f0f3944c037a21cfd99a4af7
Driver core: fix race in sysfs between sysfs_remove_file() and read()/write()
in 2.6.21-rc1.  It looks to me like sysfs_write_file downs buffer->sem
while calling flush_write_buffer, and flushing that particular write
buffer entails downing buffer->sem in orphan_all_buffers.
Suspend no longer deadlocks with the following silly patch, but I expect
this either pokes a small hole in your scheme, or renders it pointless.
Maybe that commit needs to be reverted, or maybe you can see how to fix
it up for -rc3.
Thanks,
Hugh
