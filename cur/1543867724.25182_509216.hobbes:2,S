Only if kick_iocb() is called.  It won't be called if i_i_p2_r() was  
the only thing to return -EIOCBRETRY.

Not by fs/aio.c, but *by the place that originated -EIOCBQUEUED*.   
Later.  After IO has completed.  see fs/direct-io.c:dio_bio_end_aio().
This is what -EIOCBQUEUED means!  It's a promise to call aio_complete 
() in the future.
Have you read the giant comment over the definition of struct kiocb  
in include/linux/aio.h?

Sorry, I don't understand what you're trying to ask here.
