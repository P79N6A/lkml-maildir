Subject: [PATCH 000 of 9] md: udev notification, raid5 read improvements etc
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Following are 9 patches for md in 2.6.19-rc4-mm2.
The first two are suitable for 2.6.19.
The third might be.  It seems straight forward, but is awkward to test.
Possibly safest to keep it for .20...
The rest should be held for .20.
4 is a minor tidyup
5 is a resend with a bug fixed.
6-9 are resends with attribution improved.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
