With the above behavior, someone is reporting "I can use OS's A, B and C with 
no problems - the hardware works perfectly. When I try to use Linux X.Y.Z the 
driver faults and makes things unusable." and the maintainer is saying "The 
driver is fine. I didn't write code that has any bugs in it. The problem is 
your hardware is broken."
That kind of response is irresponsible and idiotic. If the hardware works 
perfectly in every other OS - and possibly even previous versions of Linux - 
then obviously the hardware isn't broken. This is what Adrian was pointing 
out and is exactly what shouldn't be happening.
