;) yes, I still have to finish hooking the new code into the
page_alloc.c, this was just a preview.
dropping pages_xx would have been a bigger change so I'm avoiding it for
now since I agree I would need to add more fields than just min/low/high
for the realtime and GFP_HIGH features (and most important I couldn't
remove those 2 branches anywyas).  In 2.4 I was ignoring __GFP_HIGH. I
doubt it makes much difference in practice, but it makes sense in theory
so I'll keep those new features of course (especially the RT one could
help in practice too).

agreed. the value tuning is quite simple to understand this way, it is
tuned exactly to start to reserve the entire lowmem on a 32G x86 box.
31G/32 = 0.9G > 800m.
