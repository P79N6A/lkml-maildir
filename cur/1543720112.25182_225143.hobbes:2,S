Just for fun, can somebody that has the required hardware just test old 
apps with NX turned on? 
I know we used to put the signal handler trampoline on the stack, but
these days that should all be handled with the magic executable syscall
page, so _normally_ I don't think an old application should even really
care.
In fact, it would be interesting to just hear somebody running an older
distribution with a new CPU and a new kernel, and see just how many
programs need to be marked non-NX in "normal running".
