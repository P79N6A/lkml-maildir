Why do the input handlers depend on CONFIG_USB_HID? On PPC we already have 
trouble with them depending on CONFIG_USB, so everybody has to select 
CONFIG_USB even if he just has ADB hardware.
Alan, would you accept a patch putting 2 main_menu's for CONFIG_USB and 
CONFIG_INPUT into usb/Config.in? This avoids the move of the input drivers 
into drivers/input as in 2.4 (which you seemingly don't want in 2.2) and 
only requires a minor adjustment in drivers/Makefile.
Franz.
