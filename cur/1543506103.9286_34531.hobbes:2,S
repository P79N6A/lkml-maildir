As always, it depends.  The UltraSparc can leave bits of the DMA'ed
data in its PCI bridges after the transfer completes, and you need to
explicitly flush the bus to make sure host memory and cache is in sync
with the device.  Unless you've mapped the region in slow, synchronous
mode.  Or so their documentation states - I've heard that real hardware
behavior isn't actually as bad as they tell Solaris driver writers.
Either way, it only affects DMA vs. host memory read/write semantics,
not readl/writel.
