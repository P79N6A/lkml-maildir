Well I dunno, Randy.  Works fine here, on aic7xxx SCSI and hpt366 IDE.

driver lost an interrupt, or it failed to deliver completion
for one or more BIO segments, or something screwed up at the
VFS level.
I am (of course ;)) disinclined to believe the latter, mainly
because of the amount of testing I do here.  Eight-hour Cerberus
runs on quad CPU, five IDE disks and six SCSI disks all chugging
along, no probs.
Is it reproducible?   Are you able to try it on a different machine?
On other disks in the same machine?
