well, as i said, i agree that being lazy on the user-space side (which is
by far the biggest RAM allocator in a typical system) makes sense - and we
can handle it cleanly.
Being lazy on the kernel-space side is the default behavior for us kernel
hackers :-) but i dont think it's the right thing in the long term.

i think you've completely missed the fact that i made exactly this point
in my previous mail.
	'user-space laziness': correct
	'kernel-space laziness': dangerous
i talked about GFP_KERNEL, not GFP_USER. Even in the case of GFP_USER i
believe the right place to oom is via a signal, not in the gfp() case.
(because oom situation in the gfp() case is a completely random and
statistical event, which might have no connection at all to the behavior
of that given process.)
