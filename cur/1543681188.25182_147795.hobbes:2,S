You might want to increase the K_something from 4 (25% CPU time) to a
lower value. Also, SOFTRR tasks should get a lower timeslice while they're
currently getting the RR one. The SOFTRR policy should be used by MM apps
in a way that the thread that uses it does the minimum amount of work in
there. Like the thing we do with IRQ processing.

RT tasks are pretty powerfull and should not be used to run everything ;)
What I was seeking with this patch was 1) deterministic latency 2) stave
protection.
