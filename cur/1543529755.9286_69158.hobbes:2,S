AFAIK there is no problem with the FS on these cards, I have a working
parallel port reader, reading 8MB, 16MB and 64MB cards under kernel
2.3.51.
The only problem I have is that the epat chip (shuttle ep1284-01) is
only recognized after a windoze boot.
But as you seem to be using a PCMCIA adapter this obviously doesn't
affect you.
