The majority of Kconfig users are _not_ kernel developers.
There are many different reasons why people compile their own kernel, 
and "sysadmin who knows his hardware and the filesystems of his disks" 
is really sufficient for compiling your own kernel.
Whether non-English Kconfig texts are important might be a question, but 
if there are people doing the translation work there's no problem with 
it.
