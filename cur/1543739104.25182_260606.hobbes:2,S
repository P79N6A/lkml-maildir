Replying to myself, in hopes it'll benefit others.
It also works with NUMA and 8GB if I balance the memory between the two
processors, 2 sticks of 2GB on each.
Then the zones look like:
Scanning NUMA topology in Northbridge 24

The eServer 325 manual in one place says you must add memory in
pairs, and in other places seems to suggest (but not say it's required?)
that you add memory in 1 & 2, then 5 & 6 (with SMP), and then 3 & 4.
It would've been nice if Linux either flat-out halted on boot saying,
"This is stupid, move your memory around" or ran in a degraded memory
configuration reliably without crashing.  The scary part is that the BIOS
was cool with the configuration and Linux was /mostly/ cool with it, most
of the time, until certain usage patterns (like mke2fs) made it crash.
Andi, I can still get you information, but for now I'll mark this one down
as "user error".  Perhals you'll have an idea on how to make Linux more
robust if another user winds up with this same issue, as Christopher
Swingley and I did.
