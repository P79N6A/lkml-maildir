I'd looked for changes in tulip between 2.4.2-ac11 and 2.4.2-ac20 and hadn't
seen any - that's why I hadn't updated. I gather that the change in question
is at a higher level?
Anyway, I've upgraded to 2.4.2-ac20 and now I still get the error messages:
Mar 20 14:35:52 ulthar kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
Mar 20 14:35:52 ulthar kernel: eth0: Transmit timed out, status fc664010,
CSR12
00000000, resetting...
but instead of hanging completely the connection just gets extremely slow
and "bursty" as shown by the following fragment of ping output:

So the behavior is quite a bit better (at least I can telnet in to
ifdown/ifup) but still not OK. Once again, ifdown/ifup makes things work OK.
Thanks!

fine until the problem starts again.
