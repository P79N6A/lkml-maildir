I am not sure how you define instantiated pages. I suspect that
you mean RSS + pages swapped out (swap_pte)?

If a swapoff is going to push a container over it's limit, then
we break the container and the isolation it provides. Upon swapoff
failure, may be we could get the container to print a nice
little warning so that anyone else with CAP_SYS_ADMIN can fix the
container limit and retry swapoff.
