Ok, for now, no payload.  
The kevent interface is well defined, bounded and simple.  Let's not try
to muddy it up with arbitraty blobs being passed as a payload (and for
those people who want fimware binary crap in event log messages, please,
just use a sysfs file for access and send a kevent with KOBJ_CHANGE
action.)
The event logging people are working on figuring out what actually needs
to be logged in the first place.  Let's let them finialize that, and
then let them propose a way to get that standardized information out of
the kernel (hint, I don't think that netlink is going to cut it for
them...)
thanks,
