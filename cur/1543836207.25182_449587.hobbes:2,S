Nice to know it works for someone. Yes, it sometimes ends up in a loop
if I do something "funny". (But I guess error handling during _enroll_
is not that critical :-).

Thanks.
One more question: Does someone still have original Windoze that came
with x60? I think I've seen their software showing me my own
fingerprints. Can someone confirm/deny that? Getting pictures of
finterprints would be nice -- we would not have to rely on proprietary
fingerprint format only known to scanner vendor...
