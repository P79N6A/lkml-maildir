Hi!
Sorry when I post to wrong Mailinglist, but I think it is the right one! If
not tell me!
I have an problem with my Motherboard GigaByte GA-586-DX (smp board),
Adaptec 2940 UW onboard (broken), running scsi adapter ncr53c815
I'm using RedHat 6.1 with Kernel 2.2.12-20 (original from RedHat) and now
there is the problem:
during install in expert text mode I can choose my scsi card (ncr53c8xx)
but after booting the new system the kernel tries to probe my Adaptec 2940
UW(aic7xxx).
Then hangs the system.
I tried to boot with
linux noprobe ncr53c8xx=0x6400,15
-with no affect
linux pci=off  ncr53c8xx=0x6400,15
- nothing is found (of course)
I don't know further, how to tell my kernel not to probe the aic7xxx?
