To quote my own post to xfs_devel and lk july 20th, subject 
"Busy inodes after umount":
I've now been able to reproduce:
* make a filesystem
* mount it
* export it (nfs)
* mount on remote machine
* lock file (fcntl)
* unexport
* unmount
Then you get the VFS message about self-destruct. Tested with both ext2
and xfs.
A reply from Neil Brown:
Yep.  It is not filesystem specific.
nfsd does not flush locks when a filesystem is un-exported, only when
a client is removed, and that actually never happens.
In fs/nfsd/lockd.c there is a comment:
/*
 * When removing an NFS client entry, notify lockd that it is gone.
 * FIXME: We should do the same when unexporting an NFS volume.
 */
That FIXME needs to be fixed.  I need to read through some more code
before I am sure how to do it, but it shouldn't be too hard.
I hope that can be of some help?
