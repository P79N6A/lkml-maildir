That is not practical. Surely there is an API to find out if an IP
address connects to the machine itself. If every UNIX system on
this planet can do it, then surely Linux can do it.
The same issue is true for local subnets. Surely there exists an
API to find out what subnetworks a machine is attached to. If every
UNIX system on this planet can do it, then surely Linux can do it.
