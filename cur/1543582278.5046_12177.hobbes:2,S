You must also update wake_process_synchroneous(), otherwise you can get
lost wakeups with pipes.
Something like
>         if (!(p->cpus_allowed & (1 << smp_processor_id()))
>                 reschedule_idle(p);
must be added after add_to_runqueue().
Ingo Molnar did some testing with tux2, and under high load wakeups were
lost without such a patch.
