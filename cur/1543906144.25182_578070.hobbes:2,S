Yes.  It is designed for PI and I wasn't suggesting you shouldn't use
the logic itself.  What I was suggesting is that dealing with an API
that has "rt_mutex" in it for something that has nothing to do with
rt_mutexes is, well...
All I was suggesting is that we break out the PI subsystem from rt_mutex
code so its an independent PI API and have the rt_mutex subsystem become
a user.   That's a far cleaner way to do it, IMHO.
