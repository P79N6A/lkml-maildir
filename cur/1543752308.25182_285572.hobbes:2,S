Nothing heavy, but I was reading mail, and switching GNOME workspaces.
Workspace switching often caused trouble in the past, but I had
already hacked my X server not to run nice -10 (which is the Debian
default).

Having totally screwed up the test once already, I hesitate to claim
100% surety about anything.  :-)
The script starts all the clients.  I ran it with nice --20.  I just
started it again so I could check the nice values with GNOME system
monitor.  They all have -20, AFAICS.  There are a bunch of them at
-20, and I don't see any process that looks relevant without -20.

No problem (it might be Thursday before I have time to try it).
