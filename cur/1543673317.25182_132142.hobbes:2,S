Well, I am only suggesting a way to _FORCE_ interrupts to happen
at a certain rate controllable by _SOMEBODY_, not as the system
gets them. Chris was concerned about not having a way to 
_GENERATE_ interrupts at a certain rate.
What you are suggesting is the other part of the picture, how to
measure the latency and AFAICS, it is not part of the problem of
generating the interrupts.
