It only triggeres with the switching of the idle governors. And not just
one, you need to switch twice. The first loading of a governor does not
call cpu_idle_wait, but the second one does. NO_HZ must also be enabled,
plus this needs to happen when no events or threads are scheduled to run
on a CPU, which limits this to boot up.
Also, this only seems to happen on my 2x2 (4way) and only once in a while.
I'm surprised that I'm the only one so far to report it. I can boot up the
2.6.23 kernel on this box to see if it also hangs sometimes. But, as I
said, it may take several hundreds of tries to see it.
