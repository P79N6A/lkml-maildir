That suprises me a lot. On a 2 way and 4 way the 2.4 memory overcommit
check code didnt show up. That may be down to the 2 way being on a CPU
that has no measurable cost for locked operations and the 4 way being an
ancient ppro a friend has.
If it is the memory overcommit handling then there are plenty of ways to
deal with it efficiently in the non-preempt case at least. I had
wondered originally about booking chunks of pages off per CPU (take the
remaining overcommit divide by four and only when a CPU finds its
private block is empty take a lock and redistribute the remaining
allocation). Since boxes almost never get that close to overcommit
kicking in then it should mean we close to never touch a locked count.
