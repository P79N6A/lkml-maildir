Uhm, that's a different symptom than "doesn't work" :)
thanks for clarifying.
Sounds more like a problem with the Cardbus controller not providing
access to PCI config space, not telling PCI generic code there is a
PCI bus below it, or something like that.
Can you post "lspci -vvv -s 02:09" output for 2.6.17 as well?
I'd like to compare the CardBus bridge config info for both (2:09.0
and 02:09.1) controllers on both kernel releases.
thanks,
grant
