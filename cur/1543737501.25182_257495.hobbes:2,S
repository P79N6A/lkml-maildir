I'm pretty sure all the bad ones we had (at least the one I found at my
location) "failed" the quick test in that after the quick test it asked me
to run the full test, after which it spit out the magic fault code to give
Maxtor's RMA form.  Another possibility that comes to mind is that your
power supply could be inadequate to run the system and all the drives.
