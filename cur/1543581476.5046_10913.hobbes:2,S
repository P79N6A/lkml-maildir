Just as an aside, I've watched this conversation go on and on while I 
run reiserfs on several servers, workstations, and a notebook.  I have 
current kernels and have watched carefully for corruption.  I haven't 
seen any evidence of corruption on any of them including my notebook 
which has a bad battery and bad power connection so it tends to 
instantly die.
Alan, is there a particular trigger to this?
