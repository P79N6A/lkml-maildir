Thanks for the report.  I introduced this bug recently when I changed
around some of the locking but forgot about the writeback issue.  I don't
think this is directly related to any other crash you might have seen.
I've moved the call out of the lock-holding region, where it didn't need to
be.  I'm updating my patch series now; I've appended the incremental patch.
Thanks,
Roland
