Some practical questions for my new role. I intend to set up a public
git repository (preferably on kernel.org, but I don't currently know the
criteria there) as a means to expose my patches.
From what I've observed, the work flow is something like this:
Have a "for-andrew" and a "for-linus" branch, depending on stuff for -mm
or the main tree. Moving stuff between the two will be done in my rep
and after which I send pull requests to LKML.
This might be a misunderstanding on my part, or for other reasons, not a
way you wish to work. So I'm open to input on how I should structure things.
