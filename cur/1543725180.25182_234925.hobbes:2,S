Not at all. It is simply due to the fact that
- I started working on the giant diff;
- patch-scripts (TM) is not too bad to rework (insert/split) patches so
  I do not try to make the patches perfect from the start.
If there is a specfic tag in the cvs tree which is supposed to be synced
with the kernel tree at a given time, it could make my life easier though.

-> I'd simply turn 'dev->priv' into 'priv'.
