Well, seeing as I'm currently on 2.5.2 still, waiting for various changes
to stabilise, its still not really high on my priority list.  Things
that are high on it is to move forward RSN and put in place all the
changes for ARM that are needed between 2.5.3-pre1 and 2.5.4.  There's
several bits that need to be looked at, and some of the changes that
have happened in 2.5.2-rmk clash with some of the changes in these
patches, c'est la vie.
Also high is to do something about the growing mountain of patches in
my patch system that need to be processed.
So, I hope you can see that any changes you put into current Linus
kernels won't change the situation for a while because I'm too overloaded
with other stuff and stuck back at 2.5.2 currently.
