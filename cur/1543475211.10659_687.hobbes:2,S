Hello,
As I am not a subscriber please also CC your replies to

The Changes for the new kernel versions indicate that the NFS code is
going to be revised in a major fashion in 2.2.x. Does this include
NFS/tcp? NFS v3? The linux-kernel list archives were quite confusing
and speak of the NFS/tcp mystery etc. Some clarification would be
greatly appreciated. 
Current experience:
Client: Linux version 2.0.36 / Pentium NFS compiled as a module
	(also tested with 2.2.0-pre4 with/without tcp option to mount)
Server: Solaris 2.6 / Ultra I 170 (Sun's nfs daemon supports
			Version 2 and 3)
Rsize/Wsize: various sizes tried 1024 to 32768
Read from the Server to the Client is quite fast but
Write from Client to Server is about *5 times slower*.
Looking at the log shows a number of sunrpc "Partial xmit"'s.
Any help would be greatly appreciated. Local Solaris fans need to be
convinced that Linux *is* superior!
With best regards,
Kapil.
