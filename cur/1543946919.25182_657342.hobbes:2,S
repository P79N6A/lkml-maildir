Just from a high level view, in some cases we can just say that no we
aren't going to support this. And this may well be one of those cases.
The more constraints placed on the VM, the harder it becomes to
improve and adapt in future. And this seems like a pretty big restriction.
(especially if we can eg. work around it completely by having a special
purpose driver to get_user_pages on comm buffers as I suggested in the
other mail).
At any rate, I believe Andrea's patch really places minimal or no further
constraints than a regular CPU TLB (or the hash tables that some archs
implement). So we're kind of in 2 different leagues here.
