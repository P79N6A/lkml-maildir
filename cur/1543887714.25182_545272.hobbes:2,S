Why would that kill anyone's writes?

Which ways? Are you talking about prepare_write being called from page_mkwrite,
or anywhere?
More generally it sounds like a nasty thing to have a writeback cache if it can
become incoherent (due to dirty pages that subsequently cannot be written
back) without notification. Have you tried doing a write-through one?
You may be clearing PG_uptodate, but isn't there still an underlying problem
that you can have mappings to the page at that point? If that isn't a problem
for you, then I don't know why you would have to clear PG_uptodate at all.

truncate_complete_page does that because it has to handle the case where
the mapping changes from one thing to something else that is non-NULL,
which tmpfs does.
This is not the case for most code in fs.
