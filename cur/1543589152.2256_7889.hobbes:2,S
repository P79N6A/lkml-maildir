Only if devfs is mounted.  That's my point.  Maybe it's an corner case to
have devfs compiled into the kernel, but not mounted, and so we can just
ignore this, but it seems to me that /proc/partitions should reflect which
/dev system is currently running.

Yeah, as long as devfs is running, that makes sense.
