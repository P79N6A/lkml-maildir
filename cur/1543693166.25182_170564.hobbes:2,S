There may be many reasons here, take a look at how many times the
dvd contents were used.  You may get a surprise there.  
The number ought to be 1, right?  But the burner program may read
smaller chunks or something, causing many references to the same block.
Also, the number-of-references approach has its own problems.
Something that is used a lot for a while will stay in cache for
a long while when no longer used, taking up space.  That can be
a problem too - i.e. run some large simulation which fill up
memory for a while, and nothing else stays in cache afterwards.
