Hello,
I have an Intel 536EP modem I would like to be able to use with linux. I 
have kernel 2.6.3 installed. I notice that the  modem is detected by the 
system and several files in the kernel source tree have make reference 
to it...
#grep -rn '536EP' /usr/src/linux-2.6.3 yields
Binary file arch/i386/boot/compressed/vmlinux.bin matches
Binary file drivers/pci/built-in.o matches
drivers/pci/pci.ids:6672:    1040  536EP Data Fax Modem
drivers/pci/devlist.h:7905:    DEVICE(8086,1040,"536EP Data Fax Modem")
Binary file drivers/pci/names.o matches
Binary file drivers/built-in.o matches
Binary file vmlinux matches
Is it possible to get this modem to work?
