Setting CONFIG_PNPACPI=n ( which can be found in drivers/pnp btw, for
all those reading this thread ) indeed fixes the problem.
As does applying your remove_driver.patch ( with CONFIG_PNPACPI=y) from
the other other thread.
Both work-arounds  also fix the asus_acpi kernel module which either
wouldn't load at all (no such device) or would load but do nothing
(empty /p/a/asus).
