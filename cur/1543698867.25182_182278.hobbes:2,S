I'll throw my hat in here as well.  This is an old compaq proliant I 
have at the office- dual 400 PII, booted with "noirqbalance" 2.6.0-test11:
            CPU0       CPU1
   0:    2580383    1920931    IO-APIC-edge  timer
   1:          6          3    IO-APIC-edge  i8042
   2:          0          0          XT-PIC  cascade
   5:        467        423   IO-APIC-level  TLAN
   8:          1          0    IO-APIC-edge  rtc
   9:         15         15   IO-APIC-level  sym53c8xx
  10:         17         17   IO-APIC-level  sym53c8xx
  11:       1602       1593   IO-APIC-level  ida0
  14:          8          2    IO-APIC-edge  ide0
NMI:          0          0
LOC:    4501366    4501354
ERR:          0

witout "noirqbalance" we interrupt on CPU0 solely.
