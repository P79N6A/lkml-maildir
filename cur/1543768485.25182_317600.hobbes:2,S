Subject: [PATCH 3/4] iseries_veth: Don't leak skbs in RX path
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Andrew, Jeff,
Under some strange circumstances the iseries_veth driver can leak skbs.
Fix is simply to call dev_kfree_skb() in the right place.
Fix up the comment as well.
