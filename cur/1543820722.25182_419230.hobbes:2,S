I tried reducing the code I have to the minimum necessary to demonstrate the
problem.  It went away, I'm afraid.  Since I'm already aware of a workaround
(call accept in a loop until you get EAGAIN), I guess I'll just forget about
it.  Unfortunately I can't post the full code, not that you'd want to dig
through all of it anyway.
Thanks to everyone that responded.
