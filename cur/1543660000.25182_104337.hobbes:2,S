Doesn't solve my problem. To tell you the truth I already use CONFIG_DRM=n
for a while now considering it keeps me from switching from console to X
(either in 2.4 or 2.5). It just locks hard if I do so.
Anyway, it can't be an X conflict, as far as I'm concerned because the
problems happen on the framebuffer console, not X related. Please refer
to my first email, which I sent to you directly and to this list, for
details.
And thanks for your reply.
