hi
First, I did this:
   made kernel with cpu=486, gcc-3.3.6
   worked fine.
Next, changed cpu to k6, all else same.
   worked fine.
Then, after mrproper, rebuilt with gcc-4.1.1, no other changes.
   compiles ok, installs ok. But, when attempting to load a module, get
   the following message:  version magic '2.6.16.19via K6 gcc-4.1',
   should be '2.6.16.19via 486 gcc-3.3'
How should I fix it?
Please cc personally.
   Thanks,
     russ
