  Thanks moses -- this is the instability that I have as well.
I tried compiling on 1/2 of the k7 optimized mmx routines.
So far, running with JUST the fast_clear_page using k7 streaming (and
not
fast_copy_page), the system is still stable.  I'll try adding fast_copy
_page, but I think that's where our problems lie (of course I could be
full of crap,  too).
