Certainly sleeping in accept will be just way better than file any locking.
OTOH accept() is still _wrong_ as it wake-one FIFO while it should wake-one
LIFO (so that we optimize the cache usage skip TLB flushes and allow the
redundand tasks to be paged out). I can only see cons in doing FIFO wake-one.
