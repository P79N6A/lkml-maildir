Someone is calling console functions from interrupt context.
Unfortunately your backtrace looks wrong.  Could you
please rerun ksymoops and send me the output?  Make
sure you're using the correct System.map (ksymoops -m).
It should be pretty straightforward to fix.  While we're there
we'll do something about do_SAK(), which is acquiring the
tasklist_lock from interrupt context.  For heaven's sake.
