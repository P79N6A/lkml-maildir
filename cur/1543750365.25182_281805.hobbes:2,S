Yes, but if you use "nash" as a script parser and compile everything you 
need static with dietlibc or uClibc (or some other small libc 
replacement), 200k will be plenty to accomplish what you want. You'll 
probably be able to find pre-compiled binaries like these on the net, if 
you search for them.
Of course this is much more work than simply patch the kernel to wait a 
little, but with this training you'll be able to handle similar 
situations in the future were there is no patch to solve them.
