Why do we always pass mm and vma down, even if vma->vm_mm
contains the mm, where the vma belongs to? Is the connection
between a vma and its mm also protected by the mmap_sem?
Is this really necessary or an oversight and we waste a lot of
stack in a lot of places?
If we just need it for accounting: We need current->mm, if we
need it to locate the next vma relatively to this vma, vma->vm_mm
is the one.
Puzzled
