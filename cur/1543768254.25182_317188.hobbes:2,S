oops.
+#ifdef CONFIG_X86
+#define __cacheline_aligned_mostly_readonly		\
+  __attribute__((__aligned__(SMP_CACHE_BYTES),		\
+		 __section__(".data.mostly_readonly")))
+#else
+#define __cacheline_aligned_mostly_readonly __cacheline_aligned
+#endif
So on x86_64 we're putting __cacheline_aligned_mostly_readonly stuff into a
section which is not implemented anywhere.  I'm rather surprised that the
kernel linked at all.  But I'm more surprised that it mysteriously oopsed.
Oh well, I'll change that to CONFIG_X86 && !CONFIG_X86_64, thanks.
Or maybe Christoph wants to rustle up the x86_64 patch?  We really should
patch all architectures if we're going to do this thing.
