It's possible that even x86 will support multiple IOMMUs in the future
- for example, the Calgary IOMMU support we recently added to x86-64
could be modified to work on plain x86 as well.
I like the idea of a per-device DMA-API implementation, but only if it
can be done in a way that is zero cost to the majority of the users of
the API. We already have dynamic dma_ops on x86-64 to support nommu,
swiotlb, gart and Calgary cleanly, extending it to use a per-device
dma-ops isn't too difficult.
