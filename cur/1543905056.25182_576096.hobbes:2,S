No, I specifically mean the standard ones provided by
format_corename(), such as %p (pid), %s (signal), or %e (executable
name). I don't see a reason to provide additional functionality.

I don't think that this will be necessary. After all, the crash
handler can read all the environment from /proc/<pid>/ (and that's
indeed what apport does to figure out relevant parts from the
environment like the locale).
It seems we misunderstood each other, I don't expect or want any new
functionality in core_pattern. AN example might make it more clear:
The original problem that we are trying to solve is the current
behaviour of core_pattern expansion with pipes:
  |/bin/crash --pid %p
would try to execute the program '/bin/crash --pid 1234' instead of
calling /bin/crash with ['--pid', '1234'] as argv, right? Your patch
achieves the latter by splitting the formatted core dump string into
an array (at spaces).
I pointed out that this leads to problems when macro values contain
spaces. This currently affects hostname (%h) (although this really
should not happen in practice) and executable name (%e) (rare, but at
least valid).  I. e. for an executable name "foo bar" your patch would
expand
  |/bin/crash %e
to ['/bin/crash', 'foo', 'bar'] instead of ['/bin/crash', 'foo bar'].
Of course this is a corner case, and personally I don't really care.
I strive to keep the assumptions about the interface at a minimum, so
right now Apport's only required input is the core dump itself (over
stdin); signal and pid can be read from the environment, and if not
present, they are read from the core dump.
I did not defend Ubuntu's usage of environment variables, on the
contrary. Using the standard macros is more explicit and elegant, and
I welcome that change. I just pointed out the reason why we chose the
environment variable approach initially.
I just wanted to mention this little problem for the sake of
correctness.
Thank you, and have a nice weekend!
Martin
