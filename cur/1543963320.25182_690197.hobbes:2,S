There's a whole lot of known issues there with r3xx and later, mostly
because of the memory map...
I must admit I've been letting this driver rot for some time, hoping
that the integration of radeon mode setting in the kernel DRM would
replace it soon, but that hasn't happened yet...

You may find clues about what's wrong by looking at the way the X driver
sets up the card internal memory map. I think that's where the problem
is for most newer cards.

Yeah, looks like a copy/paste bug from some old broken ATI code, thanks
for spotting it.
I'll give your patch a quick test tomorrow on my rv350 to check it
doesn't break anything.
Thanks !
