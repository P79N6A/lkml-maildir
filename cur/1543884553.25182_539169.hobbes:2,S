OK, for some reason I remember getting a warning
error without it. I must have been mistaken.

That makes me a little uneasy. The locking
mechanisms (and just about everything else) above the driver
seem to change frequently. This involves not just the VFS but
the tty core as well.
If you are confident this will not change, I will
switch to spin_lock(). I used spin_lock_irqsave() to be
more robust against changes to behavior outside my driver.
