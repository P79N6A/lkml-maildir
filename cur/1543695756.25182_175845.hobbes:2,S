What you want is the POSIX clocks and timers CLOCK_MONOTONIC which is available 
on all archs (as of 2.6).  The call is:
       cc [ flag ... ] file -lrt [ library ... ]
        #include <time.h>
        int clock_gettime(clockid_t which_clock, struct timespec *setting);
where you want "which_clock" to be CLOCK_MONOTONIC.
