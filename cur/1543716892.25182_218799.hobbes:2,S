>i386/kernel/power/cpu.c now probably wants fpu_init, too...
Hi Pavel,
   I have updated the mxcsr patch to also enable it at the time of
resume. Please find the patch attached.
  fpu_init() is needed in the resume path, only if the user want to
change the cpu between suspend and resume. Otherwise the
mxcsr_features_mask calculated earlier will still be valid.
	Also for changing the cpu, the user will need to shutdown the
system, so it is useful for S4 (suspend to disk) state. 
  I am testing the patch. Meanwhile please let me know if these changes
are ok for you?
Thanks & Regards,
Nitin
