Isn't "DMA_NONE" expected to generate a warning or panic?
Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt says:
	The value PCI_DMA_NONE is to be used for debugging.  One can
	hold this in a data structure before you come to know the
	precise direction, and this will help catch cases where your
	direction tracking logic has failed to set things up properly.
And it just seems wrong to sync a buffer if no DMA has taking place.

This existing code seems to support the idea that DMA sync interfaces
require the direction be set to something other than DMA_NONE.
