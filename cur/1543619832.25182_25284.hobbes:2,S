Hi. I have experienced a problem with the combination of kernel-2.4.16,
the kernel agpgart module and NVIDIA supplied drivers. I don't know which
is the cause of the problem.
Symptoms: Whenever an OpenGL application crashes (segfault etc.), the
process hangs and can't be killed. Responds to no signals (not even 9). ps
-ef hangs, it seems, when the crashed process is to be listed (some other
processes are listed first).
Hardware: AMD Athlon 1.333HGZ, ASUS M266 motherboard (AMD761 AGP
chipset), NVIDIA GeForce2 MX400 gfx card.
The mem=nopentium option have no effect on the problem, but it doesn't
occur if I use the NVIDIA AGP drivers or kernel 2.4.16 agp drivers. I am
not able to test the 2.4.17 agpgart with other 3D hardware that nvidia.
