Hello Jakob,
Thanks. I got another HDD read. but How can I install it, format and
make partition as earlier ( I have partition info though ..) and mount
it? Do I need to compile the Kernel or I can attach new HDD, and start
to create file systems inside.
Thanks for your enlightments.
Regards
Manohar
