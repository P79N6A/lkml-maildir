Adam,
There's no such functionality in linux software raid exists now.
Instead, as it is implemented now, the whole drive is kicked off
the array in case of *any* error in I/O path.  There are patches
by Peter T. Breuer for 2.4 kernel for raid1, named "robust read",
which does just that, but the patches aren't accepted in mainline,
and in 2.6, the subsystem is too different.  Maybe in some future...
And BTW, there's no reason to set up RAID10 array on top of 2 drives ;)
