:) he-he, such place are in add and remove routings, and they can not be
run simultaneously
in different CPUs.
And in other places they should go through the same lock(sdev or chain):
like 
lock sdev_lock
lock chain
unclok chain 
lock logic
unlock logic
unlock sdev_lock
lock sdev_lock
lock logic
unlock logic
lock chain
unclok chain 
unlock sdev_lock
