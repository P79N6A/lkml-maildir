But, with this patch:
- we are penalizing good hardware and making them less power efficient
to match the bad ones.
- There may also be server systems which first may not have these sort
of power fluctuations and even when buggy and have this noise, system
may be in some corner of some lab with fans making more noise than the
capacitors.
