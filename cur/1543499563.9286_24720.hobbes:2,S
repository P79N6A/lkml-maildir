Hi all,
There is a new APM patch against 2.2.10 available for testing at
http://www.canb.auug.org.au/~sfr/2.2.10-APM.2.gz
Highlights:
	- Reset time across standby.
	- Allow more inititialisation on SMP.
	- Remove CONFIG_APM_POWER_OFF and make it boot time
	  configurable (default on).
	- Make debug only a boot time parameter (remove APM_DEBUG).
	- Try to blank all devices on any error.
	- Add ability for user-level programs to both confirm *and*
	  reject standby and suspend operations.
	  (from Craig Markwardt <craigm@lheamail.gsfc.nasa.gov>)
	- Don't send BUSY notifications to the BIOS when
	  state change not initiated by BIOS (bug reported
	  by Ernst Kloppenburg <kloppen@isr.uni-stuttgart.de>).
Please look at it (peer review is good) and test it.
Please send positive and negative results/comments to me.
Cheers,
Stephen
