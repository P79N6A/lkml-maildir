Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.9-ac2 fix make xconfig problem
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I found and fixed what was causing make xconfig to fail.
It looks like someone got a little too happy with the "-o"s
when modifying drivers/video/Config.in.
Here is the patch, including my necessary but not sufficient
first patch for this file.
