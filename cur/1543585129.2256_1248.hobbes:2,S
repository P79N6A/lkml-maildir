Thank you Rafael.  This is what I suspected.  I'm not sure when we starting
considering devices with a peripheral qualifier of 1 as being valid, but I
suspect it happened when the scsi_scan.c code was separated out of scsi.c.  In
any case, I'm pretty positive that it is the wrong thing to do.  This report
at least alleviates one of my fears about broken device possibilities and
starts to confirm my position.

As to the illegal request messages, I'm not sure what those are about ;-)
