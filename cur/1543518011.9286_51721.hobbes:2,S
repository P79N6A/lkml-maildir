I have had a similar problem for quite a while with a much smaller disk (4.3
GB). The BIOS does not want to translate it properly for some reason so it ends
up having above 14000 cyls. 
I would suggest to try the following - force the number of heads, cylinders,
tracks to a proper value before partitioning using the fdisk extended options
(x - expert mode).
I think that you will start seeing the entire disk but I doubt that you will be
able to boot from it. If the disk is secondary it is a way out ;-)
Disclaimer: have not tried this on a 13G+ yet.
