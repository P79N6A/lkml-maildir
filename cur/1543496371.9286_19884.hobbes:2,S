I think it should be a selectable option based on the SCSI adapter, or
even more, the SCSI target.
I mean, some option which I could feed to the driver, something like
	ide-scsi=singlelun aha1542=multilun
for the adapter oriented selection, or
	ide-scsi="t0=singlelun" aha1542="t01=multilun"
for the target oriented selection.
This is supposing I had to use ide-scsi and I had an Adaptec 1542.
I also think these problems would be more easily solved if we had a SCSI
naming convention that directly addressed the controller, a la Sun:
c0t1d3s6
SCSI controller 0, SCSI target 1, SCSI LUN 3, partition (slice) number
6, for a disk.
