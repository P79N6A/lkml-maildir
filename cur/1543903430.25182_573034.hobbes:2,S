That's separate patch but CTL_UNNUMBERED must die, because it's totally
unneeded. If you don't want sysctl(2) interface just SKIP ->ctl_name
initialization and save one line for something useful.
	{
		.procname       = "prove_locking",
		.data		= &prove_locking,
		.maxlen		= sizeof(int),
		.mode		= 0644,
		.proc_handler	= &proc_dointvec,
	},
