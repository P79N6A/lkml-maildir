El cheapo configuration, Athlon XP are not stable in SMP configurations.
(I look after a dual XP 1700+ machine with Tyan board, and it falls over
from time to time, but booted with just one CPU, the machine is rock
solid.)
Try booting with just one processor (maxcpus=1 boot option) or borrow
two Athlon MP and see if you can reproduce the problem then. If you can,
someone may help you. I you can't reproduce it with one CPU, you're
probably on your own.
