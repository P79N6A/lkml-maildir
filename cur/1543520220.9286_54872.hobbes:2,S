I dont think that is a typo.

If the MSR isnt already 0 in the non reserved bits then the BIOS has set it
up for us and we avoid touching it on the basis the BIOS knows more about
this than we do. On the K6-2 the WAELIM in WHCR is in bits 16->31. If those
are non-zero the BIOS set something.
Earlier K6-2's use the other set of code and the low bits.
