How does PG_private get set?  Could doing a > 1 page kmalloc set it
(because we end up with a compound page)?

    [... really good guide to mapping pages into userspace snipped ...]
How about the case where one wants to map pages from
dma_alloc_coherent() into userspace?  It seems one should do
get_page() in .nopage, and then the driver can do dma_free_coherent()
when the vma is released.
Or maybe it's just simpler to use vm_insert_page() in the .mmap method
and not try to be fancy with .nopage?
