you can find an interesting explanation why code compiled with gcc 3.0 is
mostly slower than code compiled with gcc 2.95 on x86 CPUs (but it is
really faster on other platforms like alpha and sparc64).
basically the main reasons semm to be the scheduler algorithm and the fpu
stack handling, but I suggest to read the full study.
I would be interested to know if this apply to gcc 3.1 too.
