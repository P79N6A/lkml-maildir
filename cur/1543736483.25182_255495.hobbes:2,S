I build amanda from tarballs for exactly that reason, and I do it 
everytime Jean-Louis releases a new tarball on his web page at 
umontreal.edu.  I have, over the years, come from a 2.2 kernel and 
amanda-2.4.1, to 2.6.9-rc2-mm3 and amanda-2.4.5b1-20040915, building 
about 1/4th of the test kernels released, half of the amanda 
snapshots and have never, ever had a problem I could blame on a 
kernel version.  Tape changer problems out the wahzoo, finally giving 
up and converting to a large disk drive that is except for a gig of 
swap, all amanda's to play in as she sees fit.
If you play by amanda's rules, she is a very diligent servant.  I'd 
bet a bottle of suds that there is something in the docs that tells 
you how to make amanda run, and that you have skipped over. Please 
re-read them again.  Also, there is an amanda support group, 
amanda-users@amanda.org, where some user like me, or any of the 
authors can probably fix you right up.
