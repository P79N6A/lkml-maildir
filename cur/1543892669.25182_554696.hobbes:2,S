If it would only display some slightly odd symbols I wouldn't complain.
The problem is that the second byte is interpreted as a control code.
Is there any trick to get the shell working again in this situation?
The cursor hangs, and I've not yet found a trick to do anything in this
xterm again (except for killing it from another xterm).

No, "ls" can handle it perfectly:
# echo $LANG
C
# ls
??rsted
# 
Or:
$ echo $LANG
en_US
$ ls    
Ã?rsted
$ 
Different from the lsmod example, the cursor doesn't hang and the shell 
is usable after this command.
The difference is that "ls" expects and handles such issues while 
"lsmod" (and most likely also other userspace working with kernel 
output) does not yet handle it resulting in problems if bytes are 
wrongly interpreted as control codes.

See obove, it's not only "print formatting", it's "kills my shell".
