No that one is fine. I have a known problem with DAC960 and cvs gcc or
gcc 2.96.x x<74 where struct sizes change and it doesnt work.

On a crash we don't log it to a file. The problem is that you cannot be
sure of the state of the system so your logging might itself crash or
do more harm.
The important bit is the EIP value and the call trace.
