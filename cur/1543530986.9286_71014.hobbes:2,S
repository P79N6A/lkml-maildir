Subject: 2.3.99-pre2: soundcard.c doesn't compile if !CONFIG_PCI

If you don't have CONFIG_PCI defined (an old 486 ThinkPad), then you
get the following compilation error:
    soundcard.c:672: invalid lvalue in assignment
This is the code "isa_dma_bridge_buggy = dmabug;", but if you do not
have PCI configured, you have "#define isa_dma_bridge_buggy (0)".
In 2.3.51, this code was protected by "#if HAVE_BRIDGE_BUGGY_FUNC".
