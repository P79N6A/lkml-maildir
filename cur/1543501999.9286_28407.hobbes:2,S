It sounds like you're using the wrong mosue protocol.  You need to
specify the intellimouse (imps/2?) protocol for XFree86 to use a USB
mouse.  This was changed a few kernels ago (it was originally emulating
plain ps/2).

Go to 
http://www.linux-usb.org/
 (a little out of date but the pointers
are valid) and join the mailing list.  Please check out the mailing
list archived for stuff as well.  A linux-usb FAQ has not been setup yet..
