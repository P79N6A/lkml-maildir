some regression data from running the test programs on s390 and s390x:
test		31 bit			64 bit
-----------------------------------------------------
microhello	ok			ok
minihello	ok			ok
hello		ok			ok
getenvtest	wrong output		segfault in strncmp
getopttest	wrong output (getenv) segfault from getenv/strncmp
malloctest	mmap not implemented 	mmap not implemented
testvsnp	ok			wrong output
You could say you are 50% there ;-)
For the autogenerated system call objects, a quick grep in include/asm-*/unistd
showed some more that appear to be missing on some platforms:
alpha: alarm, fdatasync, getegid, geteuid, getgid, getpid, getppid, getuid, nice,
	pause, umount2, utime, time
ia64:	alarm, fork, getpgrp, nice, pause, umount2, utime, vfork, time
mips64: pivot_root, select, vfork
mips:	vfork
parisc: select, umount
x86_64:	nice, umount
sparc: setresgid, setresuid
s390x: time
s390: select
m68k: pivot_root
