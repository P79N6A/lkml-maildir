First off, the lady's name was Tillie ;)
Second, how many kernels does Redhat ship in order to have one for 
386/486/586/k6/Athlon . . . .
Quite a pain in the ass.  And look at how much shit has to be built in 
in order to get a kernel that works for everybody!  People bitch at 
Microsoft for doing it, then turn around and do the same thing.
And nobody said anything about an automated rebuild.
I said a custom kernel build at install time.  I said nothing about 
having it automated.  I wouldn't trust an automated build anyways, 
especially if it came from Redhat.  With the philosophy ESR is aiming 
at, it would be all to easy to ask the user if they'd like to build a 
custom kernel, then present them with Eric's interface.  And that has 
everything to do with interaction with good ole Aunt Tillie.
