It would be interesting if you could generate some debug dumps using
the "sample" line:
+	dbg_dump("sample", xy_cur);
The "accumulator" dumps are not needed, the raw data should be
enough. Including timing information would be helpful though, like
this:
--- a/drivers/usb/input/appletouch.c
+++ b/drivers/usb/input/appletouch.c
@@ -121,7 +121,7 @@ struct atp {
 #define dbg_dump(msg, tab) \
 	if (debug > 1) {						\
 		int i;							\
-		printk("appletouch: %s ", msg);				\
+		printk("appletouch: %s %lld ", msg, (long long)jiffies);\
 		for (i = 0; i < ATP_XSENSORS + ATP_YSENSORS; i++)	\
 			printk("%02x ", tab[i]); 			\
 		printk("\n"); 						\
Debug dumps for the following actions would be interesting.
1. When not touching the touchpad.
2. When trying to hold a finger on the touchpad without moving it.
3. A single finger movement. (Touch, move finger, release.)
4. A single finger touch. First a light touch, then pressing harder
   and harder, to see if a reliable pressure value can be computed
   from the data.
5. A two-finger touch.

No problem, I just needed a patch when I was playing around with StGIT
and thought I might as well use a real patch.
