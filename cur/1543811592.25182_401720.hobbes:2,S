I wasn't aware those strings actually came from the devices.  What I
meant was if that file is to be the documentation of the drive
capabilities, it needs to be updated to list all known capabilities (and
be updated promptly when new capabilities are created).  It currently
has many missing formats.

I've got a burner that has the following burn speeds (from memory): 16x
DVD+/-R, 8x DVD+RW, 6x DVD-RW, 4x DVD+/-R DL, 48x CD-R, and 24x CD-RW.
I don't even remember what the max read speeds are.  Which is the "max"?
The 16x DVD speed or the 48x CD speed?  Why?
The "x" unit is only meaningful with an associated format (since "1x" is
different for different formats) and with "read" or "write" specified.
Without units, the number is meaningless.

Not for DVD+RW, DVD-RW, and DVD-RAM (which is the only one there).
Sometime down the road, HD-DVD and Blu-Ray versions of rewritable will
also exist.
