BTW, the presense of vmlinux in the second modpost generates warnings
in two cases - i386 with CONFIG_RELOCATABLE and sparc32 (always).
The warnings tend to be bogus.  Do we really want them there now that
we should (in theory) get all useful stuff from vmlinux.o?  Other
targets get aways with that since they don't have relocs survive into
vmlinux...
