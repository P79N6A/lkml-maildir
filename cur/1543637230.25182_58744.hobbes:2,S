   In case of socket transmission errors etc. kfree_skb(), and hence
   xprt_write_space() can potentially get called outside of a bh-safe
   context.
kfree_skb must occur within a BH context or better context.
When HW interrupt handlers free packets they use kfree_skb_irq() which
schedules a software interrupt to really perform the kfree_skb work.
Therefore kfree_skb must always be invoked in BH or better context.
I think we need to reevaluate this situation before we apply this
patch :-)
