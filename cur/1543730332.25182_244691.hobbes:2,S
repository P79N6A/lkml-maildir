You're right that e1000 hardware does not support the per-vector masking
feature.

Agree. The question is that how many egde-triggered MSI with the same 
vector are generated by e1000 hardware when its service handler is 
still running.

I do not know much about e1000 hardware. I leave it to Ganesh for an
answer.
