The above function is suposed to be used solely from
iosapic_alloc_rte() and not for general use.
And instead of declaring all of iosapic_alloc_rte() as __init_refok
then the single line doing the call to an __init function
was factored out and marked __init.
alloc_rte() can be used from everywhere but the naming suggest
that this is for rte only.
To make it more clear what the function was used for I could have made
it like this:
/*
 * Call site shall make sure this isused only during early init.
 * Use __init_refok to avoid warnings from modpost.
 */ 
static void * __init_refok alloc_rte(unsigned long size)
{
	return alloc_bootmen(sizeof(struct iosapic_rte_info) * size);
}
Would that make the intention more clear?
As for marking all of iosapic_alloc_rte() __init_refok this was not done
because that would then not detect any new __init usage within the function.
That could be done too obviously - it is anyway only 30 loc.
