Rusty once pointed out that Linux doesn't ever implement complete
interfaces like students are usually told to do.  Instead, only
functions that are actually used are implemented.  Among other things,
this makes sure that implemented code is actually tested and works as
advertised.  Unused code, on the other hand, tends to bitrot.
Well, maybe Rusty was wrong and I shouldn't have listened.  But his
points made a lot of sense back then.  Who knows, it might still make
sense.
