Erm ... *what* I/O scheduler?  These I/O requests may go directly
to the end of the hardware I/O queue, which already has an I/O model
where each request can correspond directly to a KIOCB.  And which
does not include any synchronous primitives.
No such scheduler has previously been, or _should_ be, required.
