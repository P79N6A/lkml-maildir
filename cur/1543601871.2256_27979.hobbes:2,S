Have you tried making the down increment larger and the up increment smaller 
when the active list is larger?  This has a natural interpretation: when the 
active list is large the scanning period is longer.  During this longer scan 
period an active page *should* be more likely to have its ref bit set, so it 
gets a smaller boost if it is.  If not we should penalize it more heavily.
There are three points here:
  - small inactive list really means large active list (and vice versa)
  - aging increments need to depend on the size of the active list
  - "exponential" aging may be completely bogus

So, the question is, does my suggestion produce essentially the same 
beneficial effect?  And by the way, what are your test cases?  I'd like to 
see if I can your results here.
