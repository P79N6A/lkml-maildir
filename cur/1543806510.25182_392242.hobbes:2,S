In the not-too-distant future, there is likely to be a ram/disk price 
inversion; ram becomes cheaper/mb than disk. At that point, we'll be buying 
hardware based on "how much disk can I afford to provide power-off backup of 
my ram?" rather than "how much ram can I afford?"
At that point, things will change.
Maybe, then, everything _will_ be in ram (with the kernel will intelligently 
write out pages to the disk in the background, incase of power failure and 
ready for a shutdown). Disk reads only ever occur during a power-on 
population of ram.
Blue skys....
