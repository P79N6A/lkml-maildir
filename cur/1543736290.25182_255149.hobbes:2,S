I would have thought that always doing the readahead would provide a
more graceful degradation, assuming the readahead algorithm is fairly
accurate, and copes with things like readahead thrashing (which we
hope is the case).

I don't see why you should skip the readahead for FADVISE_WILLNEED
either. Presumably if someone needs this, they really need it. We
should aim for optimal behaviour when the apis are being used correctly...
