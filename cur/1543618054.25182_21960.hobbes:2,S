hi all,
  I'v made a linux(2.2.16) floppy bootdisk, and it
can boot properly(build with follow commands:
     dd if=bzImage of=/dev/fd0 bs=1k
     rdev /dev/fd0 /dev/fd0
     rdev -R /dev/fd0 
     dd if=rootfs.tgz of=/dev/floppy bs=1k
seek=KERN_SZ
     rdev -r /dev/floppy 1440)
I want to make a bootable cdrom using following
command.
   dd if=/dev/fd0  of=boot.img bs=10k count=144
and I burned the cdrom on windows platform with Nero,
but when I boot with it, I got follow erro message:
   Loading ............................
      
   Out of Memory
   System halted
 
What am i wrong? Any help, a links or any other
message will be great appreciate!!
Thanks in advance!
