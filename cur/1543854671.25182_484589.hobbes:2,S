That would explain the oops upon kicking off rcutorture.  ;-) Good catch --
must be time for me to visit the optometrist or something...

I did manage to get this one right.  ;-)

Agreed, probably mostly for the benefit of the human reader.

And some compilers do this kind of gathering automatically anyway.

OK, good point -- the non-active set is indeed supposed to sum to zero
unless someone is in synchronize_srcu().

OK, then the remaining area of my paranoia centers around unfortunate
sequences of preemptions, increments, and decrements of the counters
while synchronize_srcu() is reading them out (and also being preempted).
Intuitively, it seems like this should always be safe, but I am worried
about it nonetheless.

In general, I agree.  There may be special cases where the caller knows
it is safe due to things unknown to synchronize_srcu() -- Jens's example
might be a case in point.
