What, precisely, is wrong?

Is this on the web somewhere? Google is having trouble finding it.
I understand that old code bases often choke on typedefs;
forward declarations are a big problem. Not to be rude, 
but choking for forward decl's is often a symptom of 
poorly-designed code.

Uhh, gcc? 
Maybe I've just got more mileage under my wheels. Of all of the 
compilers I've used, gcc has always had the strictest checking, 
and was the most verbose about warnings.  There's a trick that pros
use when they inherit crufty old code: run it through gcc first, and
clean it up, even if the project requires using some other compiler.
I was simply stating a fact about gcc and about standard ANSI-C 
type-checking that is "well known" to anyone who's been around the 
block. I was not trying to start an argument.
