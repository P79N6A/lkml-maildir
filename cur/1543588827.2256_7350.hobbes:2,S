no need to consider class other at all, since there are so many
exceptions.  Build the serial.c pci table like
	board 1
	board 2
	board 3
	class 1
	class 2
	class 3
Special cases go before the classes.  A 16x50 compatible class other is
definitely a special case...
On a side note, an outstanding to-do item for the serial driver is to
move its huge honkin' custom PCI table into the pci_device_id standard
table.  The pci_device_id::driver_data member would then become an index
into the smaller custom PCI table.
