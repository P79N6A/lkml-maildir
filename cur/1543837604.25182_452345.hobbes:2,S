Hi Andrew,
If this is acked by the relevant people, could you give it a spin
in -mm?
This is a resend of the generic ioremap_page_range() patchset with
one minor change noted below. As Andi Kleen pointed out, I should
send the patches directly to the arch maintainers, so I'm Cc'ing them
this time around. Hopefully at least -- I'm not 100% confident with
git-send-email yet, but I'm getting there :)
Some patches have already been acked, but I'm cc'ing the maintainer
anyway.
I've reverted the "implementation" patch to use the same
flush_cache_all()/flush_tlb_all() scheme used by i386 and most other
architectures and added a second patch that converts them to
flush_cache_vmap(). This way, if things fall apart during testing,
there's only a single patch to revert.
In addition to the generic ioremap_page_range() implementation, this
updates all architectures that were relatively trivial to convert.
Most of remaining architectures implement ioremap() as a no-op or
something close. Exceptions are m68k, powerpc and sparc.
m68k has some CPU-dependent logic in the middle of the loop.
powerpc could probably use generic ioremap_page_range(), but doing so
would probably increase the code size, as the map_page() functions
have other users in addition to ioremap().
sparc maps in huge pages when possible. Better not touch it.
Oh, and I'm going to Taiwan next week, so I may be slow to respond.
