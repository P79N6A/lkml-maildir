Lemme give you a real-world scenario: Question Answering in a Dialog
System.  Your locked-in-memory index ranks documents in a several
million files corpus depending of the chances they have to have what
you're looking for.  You have a tenth of a second to read as many of
them as you can, and each seek is 5ms.  So you aio-read them,
requesting them in order of ranking up to 200 or so, and see what you
have at the 0.1s deadline.  If you're lucky, a combination of cache
(especially if you stat() the whole dir tree on a regular basis to
keep the metadata fresh in cache) and of good io reorganisation by the
scheduler will allow you to get a good number of them and do the
information extraction, scoring and clustering of answers, which is
pure CPU at that point.  You *have* to cancel the remaining i/o
because you do not want the disk saturated when the next request
comes, especially if it's 10ms later because the dialog manager found
out it needed a complementary request.
Incidentally, that's something I'm currently implementing for work,
making these aio discussions more interesting that usual :-)
