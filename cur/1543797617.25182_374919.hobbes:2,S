Richard,
It is within your power to revise the GP L to address these issues.  You 
should consider
doing so.  I would be happy to propose several changes in future 
revisions.  Let me know where,
when, and what to provide.  You can be assured I'll provide some very 
excellent input on
these issues. 
Jeff
