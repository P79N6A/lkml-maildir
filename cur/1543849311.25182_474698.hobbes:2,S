I don't think that applies to host->pci bridges though, all bets are off 
as to how their bits are defined.  One check that might make this 
feature a bit more robust is to look for a real PCI ROM on the device.  
If present, we probably don't need to bother with the system copy 
(which probably won't be there anyway).
We should probably also check whether the parent bridge of the device to 
be fixed up is a real pci->pci bridge (if possible).  That would remove 
some ambiguity that's likely to cause problems with other platforms 
too.
