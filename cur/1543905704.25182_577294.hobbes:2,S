Without the method I described to you, *any* ext2/3/4 filesystem will
support whiteouts (as long as you have the support code compiled into
the kernel :-), so there's no need for a feature flag.

Life gets very messy if you have to do this in userspace.  Example:
statically linked programs that were compiled with a version of glibc
that didn't know about whiteout records.  Unfortunately, the memory
needed to to collate directories entries so that whiteout records can
be dropped is painful enough that completely understand why Al doesn't
want to see this in userspace.  Unfortunately this is going to be one
of those things that will make union mounts problematic, compared to
something like unionfs.
