Eww. Well, let's look at some.
arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c:line 1529
        printk("\n" KERN_DEBUG "printing local APIC contents on CPU#%d/%d:\n",
                smp_processor_id(), hard_smp_processor_id());
The \n seems unneeded, since print_local_APIC() is run on each cpu.
(see caller).
Then, there are also messages that are just a standalone \n
without even a debugging level. Not sure that is useful.
	# io_apic.c again, line 1601
	#
        printk(KERN_DEBUG "... APIC TDCR: %08x\n", v);  
        printk("\n");
So, well, let's pick one with KERN_DEBUG "\n....
fs/freevxfs/vxfs_bmap.c:line 169 (near "case VXFS_TYPED_DATA_DEV4")
                        printk(KERN_INFO "\n\nTYPED_DEV4 detected!\n");
                        printk(KERN_INFO "block: %Lu\tsize: %Ld\tdev: %d\n",
                               (unsigned long long) typ4->vd4_block,
                               (unsigned long long) typ4->vd4_size,
                               typ4->vd4_dev);
Seems normal. So it looks like your regex has some false positives.
(which nothing can be done about - the 61 must be hand-sorted)
Perhaps we're looking for this idiom:
	printk(KERN_WHATEVER "Doing foo...");
	for (as_long_as_there_is_work) {
		do_it();
		printk(KERN_WHATEVER ".");
	}
	printk(KERN_WHATEVER "\n");
Yes, that imo is horrible :) since code running on another cpu can printk in
the middle. Perhaps
	int i;
	for (as_long with ++i) {
		do_it();
		printk("something informative %d\n", i++);
	}
should be done _instead_. This would also address number 8:

How is this supposed to work? Are you suggesting that the printk buffer is
locked? I hope not. Cache output until a block is ended? No, I do not think
that helps either, because the   for(){printk(".");}  loops are meant to
give an indication _THAT_ something is happening (or not - e.g. lockup).
Now, if you hold the output of a printk block until it's _end()
counterpart is executed, the user does not get any output when the
machine locks up during the for loop.
Hence, better do a full printk (e.g. with newline) in each iteration.
And if possible sparingly. Booting in 9600 bps serial mode is going to
take longer the more output the kernel produces ;-)
Or just to not clutter dmesg too much.
And at the end of the day when this would be done -
what would we need pr_foo for?
