No I'm not.  Look:
$ grep -r '#include.*lib/inflate.c' [a-z]*
arch/alpha/boot/misc.c:#include "../../../lib/inflate.c"
arch/arm/boot/compressed/misc.c:#include "../../../../lib/inflate.c"
arch/arm26/boot/compressed/misc.c:#include "../../../../lib/inflate.c"
arch/cris/arch-v10/boot/compressed/misc.c:#include "../../../../../lib/inflate.c"
arch/cris/arch-v32/boot/compressed/misc.c:#include "../../../../../lib/inflate.c"
arch/i386/boot/compressed/misc.c:#include "../../../../lib/inflate.c"
arch/m32r/boot/compressed/misc.c:#include "../../../../lib/inflate.c"
arch/sh/boot/compressed/misc.c:#include "../../../../lib/inflate.c"
arch/sh64/boot/compressed/misc.c:#include "../../../../lib/inflate.c"
arch/x86_64/boot/compressed/misc.c:#include "../../../../lib/inflate.c"
All these are to do with decompressing a compressed kernel.  If they
fail, halting is perfectly reasonable because we probably don't have
an executable kernel.  Your arguments are fine for these.  But, that's
not the full story - there are two more places where this code is
used:
init/do_mounts_rd.c:#include "../lib/inflate.c"
init/initramfs.c:#include "../lib/inflate.c"
for these your arguments that halting is fine is _NOT_ correct nor is it
desirable.  The first of these is the cause of the problems both myself
and others saw, as detailed in the URL I posted previously in this thread.
Did you read that post?
