Subject: [PATCH] GeForce3 support for rivafb

I basically just copied the source files from the xfree86 4.1.0 nv driver and 
then tweaked the rest of the rivafb files to get it to work. The patch is 
against the 2.2.17-pre2 tree. I'd like anyone with a geforce3 card at their 
disposal to please test this out and lemme know what you think.
