Jamie, looking at those reports it seems it is not only a sound players
problem. It is fine that an application that has strict timing issues
hints the scheduler. The *application* has to hint the scheduler, not the
user. If reports about UI interactivity are true, this means that there's
something wrong in the current scheduler though. Besides the player issue.
