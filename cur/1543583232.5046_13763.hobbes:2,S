anyone know if there is an updated repository for the linux-wlan
project? i need drivers for the baystack 660 and none of the wlan n
modules in the distro in the site
(
http://www.linux-wlan.com/linux-wlan/linux-wlan-0.3.4.tar.gz
) compile
under 2.4.2... i can get the drivers to compile under 2.2.16 but nothing
beyond that, 2.4.2 drivers would be really cool if anyone has them thanks
in advance --gabe
