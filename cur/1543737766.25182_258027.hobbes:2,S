I haven't had a chance to look at it in detail yet, but I think that 
should definitely cover it.  Thanks a lot.

That's one reason they made it open-source.  They're hoping someone can 
write an ALSA driver for it.

I'm not suggesting adding the drivers as they are now in the kernel.  
I'm recommending taking those drivers, revising them to fix whatever 
problems they had (including writing an ALSA driver for the sound card 
driver), and releasing the revised modules.  Or would even that still 
need the original developer's approval?

I think it was Linuxant (
http://www.linuxant.com
).  The links in a HOWTO 
file on Conexant modems redirect to that.  I got them somewhere for 
free, whereas Linuxant charges for a full version, but either I can't 
remember where I got them from or the links I got them at redirect to 
Linuxant.  And the documentation in the file doesn't list a Web site, 
but it does mention a copyright by Conexant, but I'm unsure whether 
that's for the driver itself or for the device.  Same deal with the 
Riptide sound card driver.  That was from Linuxant, but they're not 
posting that on their Web site any more, so I'm glad I got it when I 
did.  The file name for the HSF modem driver is 
"hsflinmodem-4.06.06.02.tar.bz2" and the one for the Riptide sound card 
is "riptide-0.6lnxtbeta03122800.tar.bz2".  You might try doing a Web 
search for those files.  Actually, I don't remember whether they were 
originally compressed in .bz2 format or if they were compressed in .gz 
format and I recompressed them in .bz2 format (as I did for a lot of 
stuff), so make sure you try both extensions.
