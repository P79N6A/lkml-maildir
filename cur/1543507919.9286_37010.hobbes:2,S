Just thought ya all might want to know,
The Internet is 30 years old today!
September 2nd is officially the 30th birthday of the Internet, being the  
day that the first packets were sent between the Sigma 7 mainframe that
was the first internet node and its Honeywell based IMP (Internet Message
Processor) at UCLA.
Spread the word to other netcitizens and give a toast to the old
girl. Probably 1/2 of us wouldn't have jobs if it wasn't for the net.
And most likely linux wouldn't even exist beyond Linus's hard drive.
Mike
