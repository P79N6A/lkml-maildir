This reminds me a lot of how FPU emulation was done on 16-bit x86
CPUs, which didn't have the #EM trap on FPU instructions.  Each FPU
instruction would actually be assembled as CD + <FPU insn>, except
that the first byte of the FPU insn had its top bits modified.  Of
course the CD is the first byte of the INT instruction, so it would
dispatch to a very small set of interrupt vectors based on the first
byte of the FPU instruction; in case there really was an FPU it would
patch in <FPU insn>+NOP, otherwise it would patch in CALL <FPU
emulation routine> if you were running in a small-code model, or just
emulate it in a large-code model (since the far CALL wouldn't fit.)
This is a very nice way to deal with this, since your performance
impact is virtually nil in either case, since you're only taking the
trap once per call site.  A little bit of icache footprint, that's
all.
Now, if you're compiling for 486+ anyway, you would of course not add
the extra padding, and skip the trap handler.
