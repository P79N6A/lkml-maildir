Uh-oh. Looks like hfs_cat_put() grabs some internal spinlock and calls
write_entry(). If it really is what its name implies, you are calling
a blocking function under the spinlock.

There is, but this bug has nothing fs-specific in it. You should never
block while holding a spinlock.
BTW, looks like 2.2 has the same bug.
