The problem situation that I'm thinking of is when a task gets priority
boosted by Fusyn , then gets priority boosted by an RT Mutex. In that
situation, when the RT mutex demotes back to task->static_prio it will
be lower than the priority that Fusyn has given the task (potentially). 
I don't think that's handled in the kernel anyplace, is it?
