Well, it borrows a *lot* from the PCI bus in its design.

This isn't necessarily true.  It's quite common to have multiple PCI
busses connected to the *HOST* bus.
AGP isn't a bus, it's a port.  You won't be able to bridge them, but
it's perfectly feasible for the chipset to provide more than one AGP
port.
