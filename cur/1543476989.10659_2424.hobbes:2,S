 I had wp8 problems with pre-6 until I realised that it was infact
an NFS problem. My home dir is mounted on another Linux box (currently
running 2.2.0.pre2/axp) and I eventually found wp8 hanging in an attempt
to lock a file in my home dir.
 After much fidding I remounted my home with the 'nolock' flag and wp8
works again, although it complains bitterly about all the document files
being in use (which they are not...)
 I have some sort of linux NFS locking problem, although at this stage
I havent discounted operator error on the server side.
