I compiled 2.4.4-ac4 with gcc-2.95.3. No problems with previous versions
until today. Here is the output of the kenerl panic from ksymoops:

acpi_get_timer is in drivers/acpi/hardware/hwtimer
It makes a call to acpi_os_in32
acpi_os_in32 is in drivers/acpi/os.c
This takes the argument of an ACPI_IO_ADDRESS for a port number. What is
given as arguments in acpi_get_timer is
acpi_os_in32((ACPI_IO_ADDRESS) ACPI_GET_ADDRESS
(acpi_gbl_FADT->Xpm_tmr_blk.address));
ACPI_IO_ADDRESS is a cast
ACPI_GET_ADDRESS is a converter from 32 or 64 bit addresses to 16 bit
addresses if necessary. On this system it should not do anything.
acpi_gbl+FADT is a FADT_DESCRIPTOR_REV2 (a struct).
Looking at FADT_DESCRIPTOR_REV2's definition I fail to see where the
pointer is referring to in the struct. There is no element named
Xpm_tmr_blk)
---------------
The message that I received at the top of the oops was:
unable to handle NULL pointer dereference at virutal address 0000 00d4
---------------
System:
Dual P3@450Mhz, 392 MB Ram
Supermicro P6DBE motherboard
ACPI Disabled during first boot - got oops
ACPI Enabled during second boot - got same oops
ACPI settings:
all except for battery.
