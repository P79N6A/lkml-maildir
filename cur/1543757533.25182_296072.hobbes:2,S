Subject: IDE patch to fix Promise 202xx_new

I was having lots of DMA problems with a Promise 20269 PCI IDE 
controller under 2.6.11-rc4, which made it pretty useless. I found the 
following patch from almost two years ago, which when applied resolved 
the problems:

Is there a reason I'm unaware of why this never made it into the main 
kernel tree? I've not noticed any ill-effects of applying the patch to 
2.6.11-rc4.
Thanks,
David
