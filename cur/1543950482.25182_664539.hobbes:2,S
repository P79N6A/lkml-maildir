Where exactly in the code does that happen?  kobjects should not be
"reused" as that implies that they are static, and not dynamically
allocated, right?
Which kobject is this?
Ugh, is this the sys_device stuff?  I hate that code...

The patch seems correct, but I would like to verify which kobject is
being reused here first.
