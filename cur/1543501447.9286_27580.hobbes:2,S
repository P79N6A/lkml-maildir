Why couldn't the kernel get the hw-address via ARP, at the stage just
after network has come up? There would probably not be any reason to
change this very often. And it should be possible to send this package
without much of a stack then?

Same should go for the serialdriver (I know network is more of a 
problem ;) And I for one could live with the fact that an oops isn't
send if the netdriver was down (at least you'd know the problem was
in the network code).

Because as Brian said: it is a major hassle, we allready have a large
amount of cable-spaghetti just connecting network, if we also have to
have a lot of serialcable's - more than those to routers/livingstons :(
That really amount to chaos.
