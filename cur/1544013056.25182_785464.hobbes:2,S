Actually, I even thought that this is right behavior, here on iwl3945
led is always on, and blinks while traffic is send, also same on
windows, but feel free to invert the polarity.
What does bother me is, that led state gets inverted dynamically, that
is system starts with default 'led always on', but after some time
switches to 'always led off' and after sometime again switches back.
This does seem to be software problem, at least according to sysfs
interace.
And I think led blinks too fast, sometimes it is hard to even see it.
It might even shorten led life, but this is just a guess.
