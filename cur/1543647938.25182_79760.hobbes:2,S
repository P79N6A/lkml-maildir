Subject: [RFC] Rename _bh to _softirq

Hi Folks,
Old BHs have been almost completely replaced with tasklets and softirqs.
Should we then rename _bh to _softirq ?
i.e
         local_bh_disable()      ->      local_softirq_disable()
         spin_lock_bh()          ->      spin_lock_softirq()
         bh_lock_sock()          ->      softirq_sock_lock()
         etc
Or maybe just 'si' if softirq is too long.
bh prefix and postfix seem to be confusing now.
