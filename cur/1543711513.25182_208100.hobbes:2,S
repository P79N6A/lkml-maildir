I'd say that this is definitely a driver bug.
If a driver wants to map non-RAM pages, that's perfectly ok, but it MUST 
NOT happen through "nopage()". The driver should map them with 
"remap_page_range()", and thus never take a page fault for such pages at 
all.
There is no reason to ever lazily map non-RAM pages - clearly they aren't 
using any "real memory", so there is no reason to not fill the page tables 
at mmap() time.
In other words, the driver is horribly broken.
