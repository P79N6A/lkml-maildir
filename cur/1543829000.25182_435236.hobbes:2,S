I don't think you can do that. Because ...

... there are other things in memory besides pagecache. Limiting
dirty pages to 80% of pagecache might be fine, but not 80%
of total memory.
dirty = (vm_dirty_ratio * (nr_active + nr_inactive)) / 100
might be more sensible. Frankly the whole thing is a crock
anyway, because we should be counting easily freeable clean
pages, not dirty pages, but still.
