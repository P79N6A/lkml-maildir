no, look at the code. it is not going to benefit from assembly (assuming
you can even implement it cleanly in assembly).  its basically an
iteration of other function calls.
doing a new implementation in assembly for each platform is not
feasible, anyhow. this is the sort of thing that needs to be uniform.
this really has nothing to do with the "iron" of the computer -- its a
loop to check and free swap pages. assembly will not provide benefit.
