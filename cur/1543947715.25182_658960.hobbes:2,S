Is there any current patch I should actually test - it looks there is
ongoing discussion from the time Rafael has proposed his last patch to
check by me: 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=14961&action=view
But I think it's visible the only suspend update will not resolve my
problems and the problems is deeper in the mmc.
So should I still test yesterdays' patch ?
