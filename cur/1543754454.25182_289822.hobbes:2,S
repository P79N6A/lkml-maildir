I have problems with an ALPS on serio4 ... different ones though.  And
it may be that RC2 is a bit better here than previous kernels.
For example, it says it disabled tapping -- but it's still active.
Evidently there are model-specific differences that the ALPS driver
doesn't handle correctly.

I've got similar interactions between keyboard and touchpad -- no-effect, than
after magic to unblock, a flood of characters.  The Way To Fix It is different
though.  There seems to be an interaction with window focus, since another
symptom is that for example there's no cursor in the active window ... until
it's fixed.  Sometimes things like newlines will cause scrolling, without any
other characters appearing... maybe there's a KDE/x86_64 interaction too.

I don't think I've seen either of those two problems.
I have two problems during mouse motion.  One of them is that sometimes it seems
to stop working or go into ultra-slow tracking mode.  Workaround:  wait a second,
start again; it's as if there's some timed mode that it automagically enters/exits.
The more serious one is that sometimes it seems to spontaneously emit click
events while I'm moving finger across pad.  Which means I've had to learn to
plan my "mouse" motions to avoid areas where clicking could have bad effects.
But that's not always possible ...
