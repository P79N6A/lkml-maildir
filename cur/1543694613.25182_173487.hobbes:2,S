I expect I'd be VERY unhappy if I couldn't put a complete computer in
storage any more, and expect it to work when I turn it back on in two
months / years.
What timeframe are you talking about here anyway?
Oh well, I do remember the times when disks didn't work the next
_day_ because they developed stiction and the only way to get them to run
again was to peel off the label near the center and give the thing a
not-so-gentle push with a screwdriver... in fact we had a contest how long
an 80-MB disk would continue to work with the top off. :-)
