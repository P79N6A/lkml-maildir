Neat ;-) My goal is actually not only size, but also to have a relatively
normal build environment, e.g. my example is with shared newlib, regular
ash, and - unfortunately rather wasteful - glibc's ld.so.
But a tftp loader in 20kB is rather good. Now the next challenge is the
same thing with NFS. Then we can finally kill nfsroot ;-)
