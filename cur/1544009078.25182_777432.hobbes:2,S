Just providing an empty release function to the kernel is the complete
wrong thing.  Do you not think the kernel is actually trying to tell you
something here?  If it could test for an empty release function it would
complain about that as well, providing one is no "fix" at all.
You need to free your memory in the release function that is owned by
the device/structure.  Please read the file, Documentation/kobject.txt
for details as to what you need to do.
