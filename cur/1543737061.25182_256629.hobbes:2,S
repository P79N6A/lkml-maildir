A recent note related to read vs. write speed actually shows about a 40% 
degrade in write speed from 2.6.8. I hope 2.6.9 will be held back at 
least a few days in hopes of verifying or debunking that. I have some 
results showing "slower" by about 30%, but it was just production runs, 
not benchmarks.
