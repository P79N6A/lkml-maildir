Numerous projects have been started to try to implement this, go dig
around, they might still exist.

It turns out that the masses never build their own kernels, nor do they
need to.  The act of building kernels is quite rare for the majority of
Linux users, and rightly so.  Hopefully the book I pointed you at will
help explain how to do this properly for anyone who wishes to do this
task (it's not a simple single-step process at all.)
good luck,
