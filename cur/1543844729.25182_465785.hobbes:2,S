I did - I think we want this patch.

Could we please do whatever is needed to get this blessed and merged?  This
is such a common problem on such a common driver that I would suggest that
we want this in 2.6.18.x as well.  At least, I'd expect distributors to
ship this fix (they're nuts if they don't) and so it makes sense to deliver
it from kernel.org.
