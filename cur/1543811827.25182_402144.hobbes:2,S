http://www.linux-mips.org/archives/linux-mips/2006-02/msg00241.html
 is
one example we just had on MIPS.  On SGI IP22, using the serial
console, you'd get the following on shutdown:
The system is going down for reboot NOW!
INIT: Sending processes the TERM signal
INIT: Sending proces
and then nothing at all.  I'd never have suspected the serial driver,
had not users reported that the machine shutdowns properly when using
the framebuffer.
For the record, I don't mind whether it's BUG_ON or WARN_ON, but I
just wanted to give this as an example of an "oops in hard-to-guess,
place".
