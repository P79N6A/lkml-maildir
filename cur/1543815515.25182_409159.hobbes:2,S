Subject: [patch] add private data to notifier_block
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

While most current uses of notifier_block use a global struct, I would
like to be able to use it on a per device basis for drivers which have
multiple device instances.  I would also like to be able to have a
private data struct associated with the notifier block so that per
device data can be easily accessed.  This patch will modify the
notifier_block struct to add a void *, and will require no modifications
to any other users of the notifier_block.
