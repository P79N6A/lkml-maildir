But people could get profiles out.  I know, I've seen them!

Is it correct to say that oprofile-on-2.6.18 works, and that
oprofile-on-2.6.19-rc5 does not?
Or is there some sort of workaround for this, or does 2.6.19-rc5 only fail
in some particular scenarios?
If it's really true that oprofile is simply busted then that's a serious
problem and we should find some way of unbusting it.  If that means just
adding a dummy "0" entry which always returns zero or something like that,
then fine.
But we can't just go and bust it.
