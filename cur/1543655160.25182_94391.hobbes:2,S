This is actually the result of quite a bit of handwaving; in the OOM-
handling series of patches with the GFP_NOKILL business, I found that
tasks would block exessively in wait_on_inode() (which was tiobench
16384). The qualitative evidence points toward the inode table as a
potential bottleneck in the presence of many tasks and/or cpus. No
specific benchmark numbers apply; in the original series (GFP_NOKILL),
I increased this to much larger than 256. The entire summary of results
of that series of patches was "highmem drops dead under load". But
performance benefits from this minor increase in size should be obvious.
