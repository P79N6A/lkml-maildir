Hi,
I hoped my problem would resolve itself but as it does not (yet) ...
I have an Dell Inspirion 3200 with a DVD reader. It work except a couple
a thing.
Under win98 i am able to read CD ROM (i mean CD not DVD). Under Linux
(all kernel 2.0.xx to 2.1.132-ac2) it work well except with large files
(>5 Mb). In fact, sometimes it work (e.g.. i am able to cp a 12 Mb file)
but sometimes not.
Symptoms are a slowdown of all the computer. Software reset is not
enough to recover: i need to hard reboot. Soft reboot does not work: the
computer seems to wait the DVD reader.
As i said, DVD reader work fine under win98. CD reader from a colleague
(same Inspirion 3200 but with a CD reader) work great when used on Linux
on my computer.
It seems thus to be a specific problem to Linux with my DVD reader an
only with large file. I think it might be a bug (race condition ???) in
ide driver.
