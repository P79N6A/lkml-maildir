	I have made a new version of my small devfs patch against
linux-2.5.62.bk4.  This version fixes a bug where directory->i_sem was
held while devfs_helper ran, which caused deadlock on one system.  I
am surprised I had not noticed this problem before.  This version also
adds Documentation/filesystems/devfs/small-devfs, describing
differences between the old devfs implementation and this one. You can
retrieve the patch from the following URL.
ftp://ftp.yggdrasil.com/pub/dist/device_control/devfs/smalldevfs-2.5.62.4-v11.patch
	As before, the optional devfs_helper user level program can
be retrived from:
ftp://ftp.yggdrasil.com/pub/dist/device_control/devfs/devfs_helper-0.2.tar.gz
	My "to do" list for small devfs is now as follows.
		- Submit a patch to the -mm kernels, as Andrew has been
		  kind enough to distribute this change in his -mm kernels.
		- Remove CONFIG_DEVFS_MOUNT?
		- Explore eliminating by fs/devfs/fs.c by extending
		  dnotify and ramfs slightly.
		- Probably request integration after linux-2.7.0.
