Hi everybody,
As suggested by Mathieu Desnoyers, here's kmemtrace w/ tracepoints instead
of markers. The RCU stuff has been giving me some headaches because of
circular dependencies, but I think I've got it right.
I'm currently working on another thing Mathieu suggested, that is
variable-length fields, so we don't waste space on non-64-bit arches.
Pekka, please merge this if it looks okay. I'll try to come up in time with
the stuff described above; however, should I not be ready in time, please
ask Linus to git-pull whatever we've got at present. Hopefully, it'll get
in this time.
Alexey Dobriyan, please see if that problem you reported when kmemtrace was
using markers is still there.
And (for everybody) please be kind and test and report whatever problems
appear if possible.
	Happy holidays,
	Eduard
Eduard - Gabriel Munteanu (3):
  RCU: Move some definitions to minimal headers.
  tracepoints: Include only minimal RCU headers in linux/tracepoint.h.
  kmemtrace: Use tracepoints instead of markers.
