I was kinda planning on merging it ;)
I can't say that I'm in love with the patches, but they do improve the
situation.
At present we have >50 different definitions of TRUE and gawd knows how
many private implementations of various flavours of bool.
In that context, Richard's approach of giving the kernel a single
implementation of bool/true/false and then converting things over to use it
makes sense.  The other approach would be to go through and nuke the lot,
convert them to open-coded 0/1.
I'm not particularly fussed either way, really.  But the present situation
is nuts.
