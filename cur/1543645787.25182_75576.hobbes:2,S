Are you using the new "in-kernel" driver for this device?  Or the
userspace driver?  Hm, in looking at your .config, you're not using the
kernel driver, any reason you aren't?
And if you move usbmodules to something else (like usbmodules.orig), it
will not be run by the hotplug code.  Does that prevent the oops?
thanks,
