In fact the best info is on the stat page:
...
       The set GID bit (S_ISGID) has several special uses: For  a
       directory  it  indicates  that BSD semantics is to be used
       for that directory:  files  created  there  inherit  their
       group ID from the directory, not from the effective gid of
       the creating process, and directories created  there  will
       also  get  the  S_ISGID bit set.  For a file that does not
       have the group execution bit (S_IXGRP) set,  it  indicates
       mandatory file/record locking.
       The  `sticky'  bit  (S_ISVTX)  on a directory means that a
       file in that directory can be renamed or deleted  only  by
       the  owner of the file, by the owner of the directory, and
       by root.
