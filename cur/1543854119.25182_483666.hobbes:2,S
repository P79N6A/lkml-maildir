Hi,
I just wanted to report a 'it works again' for rc6: after encountering 
the very same problems with -rc3 Jeff Garzik described in [0], I 
upgraded to -rc5 and applied the proposed[1] patch[2].
Now, the knfsd behaved a bit better (nfs-mounted /home, X11 
applications created thousands of empty 'configuration'-files),
however 'mkdir' and 'touch' still failed too often:
  $ mkdir /mnt/nfs/compile-farm/foo
  mkdir: /mnt/nfs/compile-farm/foo: Operation not permitted
  $ mkdir /mnt/nfs/compile-farm/foo
  mkdir: /mnt/nfs/compile-farm/foo: File exists
...and things like that.
With -rc6 this seems to be gone. However, I noticed this message in the 
server's (192.168.10.10) syslog:
nfs4_cb: server 127.0.1.1/192.168.10.10 AUTH_UNIX 0 not responding, timed out
nfs4_cb: server 127.0.1.1/192.168.10.10 AUTH_UNIX 0 not responding, timed out
The NFS server is running on 0.0.0.0:2049, what does this mean?
The message occurs once in a while, not sure what triggers it, found 
not much in the archives...
Thanks,
Christian.
