Well, yes. Hw blinking abstraction not generic, in sense that driver
*must* know that it may be asked for "blinking trigger", i.e. hwtimer or
its derivate. There just isn't other way to do it, because
brightness_set function accepts only "enum led_brightness" argument,
because your initial intention: avoid other properties but brightness.
It's okay, but..
Because of all above, the only way I see hwtimer could be done (and
it done that way) on driver side is:
static void samcop_leds_set(struct led_classdev *led_cdev,
                            enum led_brightness b)
{
[...]
        if (b == LED_OFF)
                samcop_set_led(samcop_dev, PWM_RATE, led->hw_num, 0, 16);
        else {
                #ifdef CONFIG_LEDS_TRIGGER_HWTIMER
                if (led_cdev->trigger && led_cdev->trigger->is_led_supported &&
                               (led_cdev->trigger->is_led_supported(led_cdev) &
                                LED_SUPPORTS_HWTIMER)) {
/* ^^^ we're checking if trigger require us hwblinking, so it's hwtimer
 * or "derivate", i.e. any trigger passing hwtimer_data. LEDs API don't
 * have any other way to pass "blinking parameters" to the driver, i.e.
 * on/off delays. */
                        struct hwtimer_data *td = led_cdev->trigger_data;
                        if (!td) return;
                        samcop_set_led(samcop_dev, PWM_RATE, led->hw_num,
                          (PWM_RATE * td->delay_on)/1000,
                          (PWM_RATE * (td->delay_on + td->delay_off))/1000);
                }
                else
                #endif
                samcop_set_led(samcop_dev, PWM_RATE, led->hw_num, 16, 16);
        }
        return;
}

Fair enough.
Side note: I'm still dreaming about hwtimer -> timer merge, and make
it smart enough to use software blinking if hwtimer on/off delays limits
exceeded. Though, I'm still unsure when I'll start that work.

Yes, there is no any user of that feature. Even not in handhelds.org tree
anymore. Though, hwtimer still using "1." reason.

:-) I'll agree here, but only after I or anyone else will make hwtimer other
way, generic one.
