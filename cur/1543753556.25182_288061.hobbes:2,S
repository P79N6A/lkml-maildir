Reisefs must handle allocations differently.  The bug only
shows up if there is an unallocated hole and a O_DIRECT write with
multiple iovecs writes partially into the allocated space 
and completes at least 1 iovec worth of data and then finishes
the i/o using buffer i/o to allocate space for the hole and write
the remaining data.
