      Hello folks, i`m looking at the DAC960 driver and i have
realised its implemented at the block layer, bypassing SCSI.
   So given i have some motivation to have a working 2.5 DAC960
driver (i have one, being my only controller)
i`m kinda pondering the matter.
   Questions:
       1. Whether we need the thing to be ported to SCSI
layer, as opposed to leaving it being a generic block device? (i suppose yes)
       2. Which 2.5 SCSI driver should i use as a start of learning?
       3. Whether the SCSI driver API would change during 2.5?
