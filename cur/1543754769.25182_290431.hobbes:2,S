John. Stop frothing at the mouth already!
Your suggestion of 256MB of randomization for the stack SIMPLY IS NOT 
ACCEPTABLE for a lot of uses. People on 32-bit archtiectures have issues 
with usable virtual memory areas etc.

No. This just re-affirms that you are an inflexible person who cannot see 
the big picture. You concentrate on your issues to the point where 
everybody elses issues don't matter to you at all. That's a bad thing, in 
case you haven't realized.
Intelligent people are able to work constructively in a world with many 
different (and often contradictory) requirements. 
A person who cannot see outside his own sphere of interest can be very 
driven, and can be very useful - in the "please keep uncle Fred tinkering 
in the basement, but don't show him to any guests" kind of way. 
I have a clue for you: until PaX people can work with the rest of the
world, PaX is _never_ going to matter in the real world. Rigidity is a
total failure at all levels. 
Real engineering is about doing a good job balancing different issues.
Please remove me from the Cc when you start going off the deep end, btw.
