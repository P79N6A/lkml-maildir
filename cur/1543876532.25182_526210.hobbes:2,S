I'm only a user, so I'm not uptodate on these addresses and how they
work. However, how does this solve the problem that running 
make oldconfig
on a working 2.6.21-rc3-mm2 .config gives an unbootable 2.6.21-rc5-mm3
kernel? If I read things correctly, you now get a BUG, but the kernel
still won't boot. If that is correct, than I, as a user, don't think
that this is the solution that I feel comfortable with. 
If the kernel only boots CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START is aligned on a 2MB
address, then we should align it, not BUG out when it's not, and
especially not when it's unaligned through no fault of the user.
Kind regards,
Jurriaan
