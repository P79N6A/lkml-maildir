The main danger for a binary-only module are not the developers or Linux 
companies, but litigation companies (SCO?): They have the lawyers, they 
either own or could buy some copyright of the kernel, and they don't 
have a reputation that they would loose.
But they would probably settle for a (large) fraction of the court cost 
to prove your case, so there is little danger to get into jail for 
criminal copyright infringement...
