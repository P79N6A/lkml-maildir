Hello,
I have installed Linux 2.4.4 on our remotely-administered dedicated Web
server (600MHz Celeron), and strange effects occurred with the Davicom DM9102
network card. It was active but apparently VERY slow, 85% packet loss in ping.
I could connect to the machine but could not do anything useful. The system had
to be rebooted into the previous configuration (2.2.12) which works fine.
I then examined the kernel logs for 2.4.4 and found the following:
PCI: Using IRQ router PIIX [8086/2420] at 00:1f.0
PCI: Found IRQ 3 for device 00:01.0
eth0: Davicom DM9102 at 0xc000, 00:d0:09:1e:61:51, IRQ 3
Thus, device 00:01.0 (video card) shares IRQ with the net card. Could it be
the source of the problem? Under 2.2.12, pciutils show the following info
for these devices:
00:01.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 82810 CGC [Chipset Graphics

Thus, it says IRQ for the VGA card is 0, not 3 (also strange).
Does anyone have an idea what is going on?
