Subject: [RFC][PATCH 0/3] Access Control Lists for tmpfs and /dev/pts
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/2/2/98

Here is a set of three patches which implement some general
infrastructure and on top of that, acls for tmpfs and /dev/pts files.
We may want to factor out some of the current ext2 and ext3 acl code
and use the generic layer instead. Comments welcome.
Regards,
