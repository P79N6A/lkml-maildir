Should be.  I've never seen an alpha with discontiguous memory.
(Well, I've not looked at a numa box, but that's not at issue here.)
FWIW, we dump the HWRPB memory table early in the boot process, e.g.
memcluster 0, usage 1, start        0, end      192
memcluster 1, usage 0, start      192, end    16267
memcluster 2, usage 1, start    16267, end    16384
where "usage 1" is reserved by the console.
