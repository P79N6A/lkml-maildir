Wrong.  This shows you fundamentally don't understand transport classes 
at all.
AFAIK, the first transport class was FC, for qla2xxx.
Read the code to see how FC avoids the SPI-centric scan -- an example of 
transport independence.

Transport class == transport layer.  Eventually this will sink in.
Transport class allows for complete transport independence, be it SAS, 
FC, iSCSI, or other.

We've still got all that Microsoft and old-Unix marketshare to steal :)

I'm merely stating I'm submitting patches to clean up SCSI core.  Others 
have submitted far more patches than I.  And further patches to SCSI 
core are needed to properly integrate SAS as a transport completely 
independent from SPI.  I'm going to be putting time and effort into 
moving the SCSI core away from SPI, so that SAS can be properly integrated.
All I've seen from you is
(a) complaints that the SCSI core is too SPI-centric
(b) a solution that does nothing to fix this

My goal is Linux.  Always has been.  I put quality of Linux code, and 
giving features to Linux users, above all else.  Have been doing so 
regardless of who employs me, for many years now.
Maybe one day I will be independently wealthy, be a completely 
independent Linux maintainer, and then people will have to find 
something other than Red Hat as the reason for why their code is 
receiving criticism.

To get a fully SPI-independent SCSI core, we must change other people's 
code.  That's the way Linux works.  We evolve the existing code.
