You're right, its not correct.  I'm sorry.  I'm looking into a locking 
bug in 2.4, which does its ipc locking for shared memory very 
differently.  Since the shared memory code looks simmilar in 2.6, I was 
making the assumption that the change applied upstram as well, but I 
don't think thats the case after looking more carefully.  My bad.
