I really don't claim it's impossible to write kernels in C++ -- it's
clearly possible given that everything you can do in C, you can do in
C++ as well. But what I argued about is whether kernel programming in C++
can be easier and more efficient, which is why I wanted you to show
some examples. Real code speaks better than thousand theories.
				Have a nice fortnight
