There is a 2.4 version of module_param().
The semantics of pci_module_init() versus pci_register_driver() are 
different across 2.4/2.6.  If you deprecate pci_module_init(), you are 
breaking drivers which right now can be ported to 2.4 with a simple cp(1).
It's just downright silly to deprecate the API that is used most heavily 
in drivers.
