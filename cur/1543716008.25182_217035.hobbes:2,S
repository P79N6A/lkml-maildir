I wouldn't be averse to changing the text the kernel prints
when loading a module with an incompatible license. If the
text "$MOD_FOO: module license '$BLAH' taints kernel." upsets
the users, it's easy enough to change it.
How about the following?
"Due to $MOD_FOO's license ($BLAH), the Linux kernel community
cannot resolve problems you may encounter. Please contact
$MODULE_VENDOR for support issues."
