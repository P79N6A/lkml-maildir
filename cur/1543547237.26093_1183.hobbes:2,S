People would appreciate lots of things but stability happens to come first.
Thats why its primarily focussed on driver stuff not on revamping the 
internals. Right now Im not happy with the nfsv3 stuff I last looked at and
it seems to still contain things Linus rejected a while back.
I'd love to have raid 0.90, nfsv3 and the new ide stuff in but I cannot see
a path for that without breaking a supposedly stable product for other people
which is simply not acceptable.
