I looked at the patch. It **IS** configurable. It has zero overhead on
a normal system. It will add a few thousand instruction cycles if,
and only if, it encounters a 'thunk' on the stack.
If there are no bugs, it would be harmless. If there are bugs they
will certainly be fixed.
It is also 'testable' which is good. It's one of those things, if
it makes you sleep better, enable it. I'd say that if it doesn't
add too much kernel-bloat, it should be in a distribution sometime.
Linus and others could see if it's 'bloat'. 
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
