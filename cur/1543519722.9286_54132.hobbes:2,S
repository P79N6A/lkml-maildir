Basically when you start a thread, the likelihood of it running on
another CPU than the one the original process is running is small if
the thread is short lived.  The reason for this is the scheduler gives
priority to a process on the same CPU as the one currently running and
more priority if that process shares the same VM as the one that was
just running.  If a thread lives long enough or there is a large
number of threads sharing the same VM, eventually it/they will migrate
across more CPUs.  Threads are no different than processes in this
regard.
