Jens or any other expert,
Thank you for supporting/maintaining the CD modules.
I'm sorry if this is the wrong place for debugging help. I've tried several 
other lists and everyone just keeps telling me to use ide-scsi. 
Basic problem, I can't mount CDs on my cdRW. They mount just fine on my cdROM 
(but not my CDRW). I get:
       mount: No medium found
I'm running 2.6.5, Debian, PDC20276: IDE controller.
When I try to burn CDs (using cdrecord with -dev /dev/hdf) it appears to burn - 
the laser comes on - i.e. I can communicate with the CD.
I hacked ide-cd.c and stuck a few printk's in to prove that when I try to 
mount the CDRW I am hitting ide-cd (cdrom_prepare_request and ide_startstop_t)
Any hints of how to debug this further? Is it possibly an incompatibility with 
my model of CDRW? strace didn't get me anywhere. Adding my breakpoints helped 
at least prove that I'm hitting ide-cd, but I don't know what function 
interacts with mount and finding a medium.
I am a tester by profession - not a coder. I can test (and break) 
anything you throw at me, but I get lost when it comes to coding. Thanks for 
your help. Some more info on my config is attached.
