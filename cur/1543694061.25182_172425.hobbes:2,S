Note that I strongly recommend not putting any important data on
a drive that has shown to have defective sectors(*). You never know when
the next sector is going to go. 
We're replacing a drive that has remapped 13 sectors or something like
that, and it's now given us the first IO errors, so it's going towards
the bin.

(*) If you're sure that something external which can be prevented in the
future caused the bad sectors, then fine. But if a drive is developing
bad sectors all by itself, the future might bring remapped sectors until
the slack remap space runs out, or one day a sector containing important
data goes bad....
