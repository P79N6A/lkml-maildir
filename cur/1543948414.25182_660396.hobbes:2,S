Michael,
Please take a look at the following patch to getrusage.2. This is the first
time I have edited a manpage, so I hope I have done it correctly!
Also, the RUSAGE_THREAD patch is currently in -mm, but not in mainline
yet. Hoping that it will make it, I have put a line in the patch that it is 
supported from 2.6.25 onwards.
Thanks,
Sripathi.
PS: I fixed spelling error in Ulrich's mail id in the CC list.
