In order to get the off board cards to boot you have to enable the option
first, now comes the FUN!!!!!!!!!
You are now required to determine the PCI card slot order.
Since LILO does not like to boot drives beyond the fourth device, in IDE
land.  You must call "pci=reverse" to invert the pci-device scan order.
For starters, edit you lilo.conf file to default to prompt booting.
'linux pci=reverse' will invoke the process.
I expect the system to hang and it better hang if you have more that just
the onboard chipset.  If it does not, I need to know.  Will do a follow up
later once you hang your machine.........
Do not worry, it will never get to a partition check or mount.
