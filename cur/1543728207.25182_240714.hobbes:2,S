It's obvious - to reduce his support load, according to the man that's
his biggest obstacle since the distros add so much broken crap to his
program. He _likes_ to say the distros ship broken crap, why else would
anyone consider getting his "pro" version?
DVD burning is commonplace and has been for years, keeping a basic
feature like that out of the open make no sense.
