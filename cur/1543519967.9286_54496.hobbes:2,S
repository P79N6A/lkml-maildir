Hi
It seems loop.c doesn't compile without CONFIG_MODULES, the culprit is
EXPORT_SYMBOL on line 715. 
Also, NTFS support appears broken, I had to comment it out to
get things to link (could be the write support, I'd check but my
box is busy compiling the kernel for use)
(Please Cc replies to me, I'll try to check the web archives, but
can't follow all of the list)
