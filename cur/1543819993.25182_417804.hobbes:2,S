his)
Perhaps this patch is something that can be useful. It can tell us where
we need to either fix the logic so that a kfree(NULL) doesn't happen, or
it can tell us where we should have a "if (obj) kfree(obj)" since it is
quicker than doing the function call.
Right now, these two locations seem to be good candidates to putting in
the NULL check before calling kfree.
