OK, I'm willing since I'm stuck with 2.6.7-ck5 which eventually bugs due 
to some USB problems.  I'm not a developer so I need a little help 
learning how to get the USB patches added somewhere in between 2.6.7 and 
2.6.7-mm2/2.6.8-rc1.  I'm kinda busy right now so maybe I didn't search 
the kernel.org website well enough, but I've reached the conclusion I'll 
need to use bk or the cvs interface.  So if someone can give me a quick 
and dirty tutorial or point me to where I can read up on this (or just 
give me some google search terms) I'd be willing to apply patches until 
it breaks and try to figure out what's going wrong.
Thanks,
Wes
