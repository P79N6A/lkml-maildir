Subject: [PATCH] reiserfs v3 patches for 2.6.6-rc2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello all,
Thanks to Andrew for helping to test and feed many of the reiserfs
patches into mainline.  I've rediffed against the current -mm and linus
trees:
ftp.suse.com/pub/people/mason/patches/reiserfs/2.6.6-rc2
The directory includes a series file to tell you the order to apply the
patches.  The same series file should work with -mm kernels as well
right now.
New in this patch set is data=journal support, which fills out the
compatibility list with the 2.4.x reiserfs data logging patches.  Other
patches include:
xattrs and acls (Jeff Mahoney)
warning/error messages that include device names (Jeff Mahoney)
quotas
block allocator improvements
metadata readahead for some types of tree searches
data=journal is experimental, but most of the code changes don't kick in
unless you mount with data=journal.
The rest of the patches should be stable.
-chris
