I don't pretend to be current on all the issues involved, but I've
always been under the impression that Linus has insisted that
binary-only drivers aren't derived works, with respect to the GPL.
If someone is worried they are, make all future headers state it
explicitly:
"Including this header in a Linux kernel module shall not be construed
to constitute a derived work."
