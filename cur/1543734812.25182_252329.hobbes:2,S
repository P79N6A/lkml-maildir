After a brief discussion with debian udev maintainer, I've an
other proposal/opinion.
The "bug" appear only in two places: at udev start and after
a modprobe, so IMHO we should correct these two place, so that:
- from a user side perspective it is the right thing!
   (after a successful modprobe, I expect module and devices
    are created sussesfully)
- there are not many special case:
   with udev use dev.d, else do actions now!
Else every distribution should create a script for
every init.d script that would eventually use (also
indirectly) a kernel module.
