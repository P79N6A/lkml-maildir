Please tell us about your graphics chipset, your .config, your
dmesg and the modules loaded. Then we my be able to help.

P.S. If anyone of you is running SUSE 9.2, try their latest
kernels from ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/kernel/kotd/i386/HEAD/
Additionally, you may have to upgrade mkinitrd and udev with
packages from ftp.suse.com/pub/projects and
ftp.suse.com/pub/people (try searching around a bit and you'll
surely find them).
I'm running a kernel from there right now and can still use
S3 without problems on my Samsung P35.
