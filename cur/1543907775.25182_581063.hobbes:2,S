Sure.  We're changing the required behaviour of .setattr.  Changing its
name is a fine and reasonably reliable way to communicate that fact.

We should opt for whatever produces the best end state in the kernel tree. 
ie: if it takes more work and a larger patch to create a better result,
let's go for the better result.  We merge large patches all the time.  We
prefer to smash through, get it right whatever the transient cost.  But
quietly making out-of-tree filesystems less secure is a pretty high cost.
I'm suspecting that adding more flags and some code to test them purely to
minimise the size of the patch and to retain compatibility with the old
.setattr is not a good tradeoff, given that we'd carry the flags and tests
for evermore.
So I'd suggest s/setattr/something_else/g.
