Hi,
Maybe I should first note that I am not against the hidden patch at all, 
I just accepted that it won't go in. I use it on an almost daily basis.

Yes, source address selection based on different rules and routing 
tables. What does it have to do with the hidden patch?

Yes.

Ok, I've quite a few boxes running that way.

??? Depends how you use those multiple default routes. If you do nexthop 
routing you do sort of RR balancing on preferred routes. If you do 
source address selection routing based on rules you have fixed default 
routes which will not match because of the fewest hops but because of 
the rule. I am a bit confused as to what you're trying to tell me.
> Source routing takes too much overhead for lots of connections, and as I
Either we have a different view of source routing or I have to ask you 
why you think there is too much overhead with source routing.

The hidden patch doesn't do source routing and the limit of available 
source routes is 254 but not because of the rules (you can have 2**16 
rule entries) but because of the amount of routing tables which is 256 
[0..255] minus local table minus main table which equals to 254 tables.

Yes, that's the nice thing about patches, isn't it :).

Yes, definitely. And I think noone has said anything against that.
