Sigh.  Can you reverse the attached patch (apply it with -R)
and see whether it helps?  VIA IRQs are a never-ending headache.

  [PATCH] PCI: do VIA IRQ fixup always, not just in PIC mode
  
  At least some VIA chipsets require the fixup even in IO-APIC mode.
  
  This was found and debugged with the patient assistance of Stian
  Jordet <liste@jordet.nu> on an Asus CUV266-DLS motherboard.
