Could you please flesh this out a bit, from a higher level?
As in: what does it mean for a server to "reject" a write?  What's actually
going on here?  Why does the server do this?  I assume that the application
will see a short write or an EIO or something?
How does this interact with MAP_SHARED?
Do we expect that any other networked filesystem would want to do this? 
(and if not, why not?) Or do they already attempt to do it in some other
fashion?

hm.

Why can't we just run the end_page_writeback() unconditionally? 
PG_writeback _must_ be set here, and it is the caller who set PG_writeback,
so this thread of control "owns" that flag.
Also, are you really really sure that there is no way in which PG_writeback
can get itself set again after the end_page_writeback()?  I'd have thought
that we should be doing a wait_on_page_writeback() after the lock_page()
there.  Remember, other filesystems might want to be calling this, so we
shouldn't be designing around AFS implementation specifics.

hm, is the pte-unmapping here completely solid?  Are there any race windows
in which a faulter can end up owning, say, an anonymous page?  We've had
heaps of problems with that sort of thing in generic_file_direct_IO() and I
don't expect it's this easy.
