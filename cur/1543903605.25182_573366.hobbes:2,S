power used at a certain frequency is not a single variable. 
In fact, on most laptops and other similarly power aware devices, it's
in fact better for power consumption to always go to the maximum
frequency as quickly as possible, so that you can be idle for the
longest possible time after that. Good luck finding a generic way to
represent such things in a (userspace) interface....
