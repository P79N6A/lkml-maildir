Yes.

Each low level subsystem(pci/usb/...) has its own
device id format and binding way, so it is impossible
to implement a generic blacklist mechanism in driver core.
It is even difficult to do the blacklist in low level
subsystem of usb. Quirk tables in drivers of  high level
subsystem(hid/bt/...) contain information specific to
the high level subsystem,some of which is used to
ignore the device by driver, some of which is used to
do some fixes to support the device.
Maybe we can provide a blacklist mechanism in usb subsystem
to ignore some broken device for driver,but it can not replace the
existing quirks in drivers of high level subsystem.
