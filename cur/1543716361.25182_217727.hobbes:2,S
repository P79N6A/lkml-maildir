SpecSFS is not really the best benchmark to show the efficiency of the
dentry hash function.  I need to come up with a better defense for the
this hash functions.  While I did not do the study for this hash
function, mathematically speaking this hash algorithm should always
create a equal or better hash.  SFS just shows equal (well, slightly
better), so Ill work on getting some more data to back up the "better"
claim.

Thats a good thing.  With the new hash function, we get 25% more bucket
usage and most of the bucket are only 1 object deep.  This buckets take
up memory so we better use them.   The old hash functions was no very
efficient in spreading the hashes across all the buckets, with the new
hash function we have 4.5 times more buckets with only 1 object deep so
it scales better as we increase the number of buckets as well.
It also provides a 3% improvement on the overall SFS number with half
the number of buckets use which I believe its a great improvement from 
just a hash algorithm change.
