Subject: sdhci needs card to be present when loading module.

In the 2.6.17-rc4 kernel (and 2.6.17-rc1), on my laptop, if you load the
sdhci driver with no SD card in the slot, it never seems to be able to
detect the insertion of a new card later on.
However, if I load the module with a card present.  Removing it and then
plugging it (or another one) in later seems to work just fine.
Is this expected?
Any kernel log messages I can provide to help with this?
thanks,
greg k-h
