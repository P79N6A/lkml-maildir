I'm not looking at the cfs_rq, but at rq. Looking at cfs_rq isn't
correct because it might be a group with only a single task even though
there might be more tasks on this cpu.
Now it turns out, looking at the rq isn't correct either. At the time I
think I thought that a runnable RT task would've preempted - but that is
of course not valid under all preemption models - and racy even on
PREEMPT=y

We're not actually finding a rt task. Just the presence of a runnable RT
task on this CPU skews the weights and fools my test.
rightmost returns NULL because there just isn't anybody else in the CFS
rq (note that current isn't in the tree).
