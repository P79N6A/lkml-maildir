It is, especially if you're living in a place where power infrastructure
is unreliable (such as where I live). Currently, because of the summer
heat, power demand exceeds power supply so we experience practically
daily rotating 4-hour power interruption. 
That 3W saved multiplied by the total number of computers is a lot.
In this perspective, S2D (or shutdown) is preferred over S2RAM.
