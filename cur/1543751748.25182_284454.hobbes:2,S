Hello,
     I read kmalloc kernel-api.pdf page and found that
 * %GFP_USER - Allocate memory on behalf of user.  May
sleep.
 *
 * %GFP_KERNEL - Allocate normal kernel ram.  May
sleep.
 *
 * %GFP_ATOMIC - Allocation will not sleep.  Use
inside interrupt handlers.
What i want to know if i write a Device driver that
has kmalloc statements require allocate some string
variable then which flag i should use?
As apis said GFP_USER. But if i want my kernel module
to be require to work in kernel always then can it be
ok to use GFP_KERNEL??
What are then disadvantages to that???
regards,
cranium
