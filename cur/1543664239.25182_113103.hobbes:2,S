This week's status update is available at the usual URL:
  
http://www.kernelnewbies.org/status
Changes since the last update are in bold on the Web page.
Besides the recent inclusion of the high-resolution POSIX timers,
a lot of work has been done on IO scheduler optimizations recently.
Let me know if anything is missing or inaccurate on the status
page!  Enjoy,
-- Guillaume
