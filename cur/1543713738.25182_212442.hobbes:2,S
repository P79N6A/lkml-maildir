Here we go:

the global quips you posted indeed had no way to account for the part of
the curve where 4:4 badly hurts. details in the above url.
Please cross check my results on your hardware (I used a 2.5Ghz xeon, 1G
of ram, and benchs run fresh after boot with all ram still free).
Numbers are perfectly reproducible for me, and they make perfect sense
too.  2.6.5-aa4 is the same as 2.6.5-aa3 for this benchmark (though I'll
upload 2.6.5-aa4 in a few hours).
