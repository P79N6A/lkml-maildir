This is almost certainly related to the addition
of pty devices to devfs in bk-driver-core.patch
Change is by olh@suse.de
This explains why you are seein pty major devices
created in a /dev/tty directory.
Specifically the changes in drivers/char/tty_io.c
in function tty_register_device()
Try backing out that specific portion of bk-driver-core.patch
