Hi all out there,
somebody in here, told that he uses more than 16 devices and that 
the kernel causes problems. I just made a quick patch, making the 
number of eth devices configurable. Please test it out.
Perhaps just a short note for you all:
I expierences harsh problems compiling the current kernel 
releases. Especially the experimental serie (2.3.x) caused me 
headache. gcc is 2.8.1. The main problems are in the filesystems. 
So I can neither use MSDOS, NTFS nor SMBFS. The last does not 
matter much, but the first and second is often used here.
Can anyone confirm these problems? Or is this just a problem that 
a just-known-by-Nico ;-)
