I agree with this change and fuse will make use of it as well.
Maybe instead of unconditionally moving attr_kill_to_mode() inside
->setattr() it could be made conditional based on an inode flag
similarly to S_NOCMTIME.  Advantages:
 - no need to modify a lot of in-tree filesystems
 - no silent breakage of out-of-tree fs
Actually I think the new flag would be used by exacly the same
filesystems as S_NOCMTIME, so maybe it would make sense to rename
S_NOCMTIME to something more generic (S_NOATTRUPDATE or whatever) and
use that.
But that could still break out-of-tree fs, so a separate flag is
probably better.
