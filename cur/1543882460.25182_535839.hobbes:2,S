Anton hasn't pulled my changes -- it's a separate implementation,
although very similar. In return for the account on git.infradead.org he
said he was going to port the two drivers I already had (PMU and OLPC)
to his framework.
I have no particular attachment to my own version. I'm perfectly happy
just to use Anton's. Mine's still present just for reference, and hasn't
actually been touched in months -- I haven't had the time.
