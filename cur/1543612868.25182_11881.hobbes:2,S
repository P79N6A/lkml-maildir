Alan, you're mixing switch mm costs with cache image reload ones.
Note that equal mm does not mean matching cache image, at all.
I would say that they're completely unrelated.
By having only two queues maintain the implementation simple and solves
99% of common/extraordinary cases.
The cost of a tlb flush become "meaningful" for I/O bound tasks where
their short average run time is not sufficent to compensate the tlb flush
cost, and this is handled correctly/like-usual inside the I/O bound queue.
