At the cost of stack operations in, and out, of the function, you
can guarantee reliable results regardless of what a particular
gcc version does. Just push/pop the registers you destroy within
the function. These operations only occur once going in and once
coming out of the function. Just tell gcc that you don't destroy
any registers, then don't destroy any.
Long long division is not going to be efficient anyway. Long-long
compares are also not very efficient because of the necessary
jumps on condition. It may be better to just do the subtraction
(a compare is a subtraction). Addition and subtraction are straight-
forward because the carries are in the flags so you don't have to jump.
Lib-gcc has the code. It could be "lifted" and massaged into inline
functions.
