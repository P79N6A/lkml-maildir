Ugh. I like the sequence number suggestion better.
This is about speeding things up after all.
A signal that I could register to get would be best of all.

Eh, why did we add the /proc/*/wchan files then if not
to use them?
One problem with parsing /proc/kallsyms is that I can't mmap
it and do a binary search. (the System.map was done this way)
It looks like I'd have to read half a megabyte of text, then
sort it for later use. It's highly desirable that the procps
tools not eat lots of memory or suffer high start-up costs.

I'm not so sure anything needs to be fixed, save for SGI upgrading
to a more modern procps. There are many more important things:
Supply a real SUSv3-compliant %CPU
Supply whole-process CPU usage data
Add a /proc/*/tty symlink
Allocated PIDs by least-recently-used for safety
Add an "adopted child" flag (for processes reparented to init)
Supply the sleep time (in seconds for example)
Supply jobc, the "count of processes qualifying PGID for job control"
Supply the raw task_struct and the needed debug info
