It's probably not worth the complication, but I suppose that could be
reduced to one cacheline by lazily enabling the TSC access.

I disagree with this wording. First, for most users the worry isn't so
much covert channels, as it is side channels. In other words, the
worry is not so much that data is sent to the SECCOMP process
secretly, as that the data could be sensitive. Second, the feature
closes one only one type of side-channel; others may still exist. It's
quite possible for cpu bugs or undefined behaviour to reveal internal
cpu state (possibly affected by another process) without otherwise
being security risks. (In my uninformed opinion). I wouldn't worry
about such side channels myself, but they do likely exist.
Suggested wording as a patch against 2.6.18-rc1-mm1:
------
Change help text for SECCOMP_DISABLE_TSC to warn about
side channels (the larger concern) instead of covert channels.
