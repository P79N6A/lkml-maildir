Looks that the scsi changes introduced in test9-pre3
broke the functioning of "scsihosts" that can be specified from lilo.conf
In my kernel, I had ncr53c896 and aic7xxx compiled in
and was using
	append = "scsihosts=ncr53c8xx"
in /etc/lilo.conf as the boot disk was on ncr controller.
Removing this line and making aic7xxx as a module allowed me to boot.
