This seems way to complex in the case of reiserfs... you're only going
to see tails for small files (typically under 16k) and for the tail
part when less than a block.
Since O_DIRECT much be blocked sized and block aligned, I'm not sure
if this is a problem at present...
    I suspect the reason XFS never did small files in the inode was
    because of the problems with implementing mmap and O_DIRECT.
How does IRIX deal with O_DIRECT read/writes of a mapped area?
Invalidate them or just accept things as being incoherent?
