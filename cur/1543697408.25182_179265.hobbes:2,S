This is what I alluded to a few lines later - saying that if you move the
driver down to ring1, then you should move _everything_ down to ring1 and
just leave a microkernel at ring0.
Now, I'm not big on microkernels, but a pure virtual machine abstraction
is at least not the distateful academic mental masturbation that we saw in 
the 80's.
