Forgive me for asking a question that probably enough research would
answer, but which exact patch of those listed does fix this problem?  I
cannot find the right one myself, and I would like to just address this
problem that has haunted me at least since 2.6.6, I guess.  Or is the fix
too interdependent with other changes?
