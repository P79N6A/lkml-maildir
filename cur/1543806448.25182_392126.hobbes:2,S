There is a slim chance that Joerg might really believe that
Linux has an internal B/T/L view of everything. That would
be odd to us of course. He has clearly been spending time
with the Solaris kernel. If his only kernel experience comes
from systems that do make up a phony B/T/L view, then he might
just assume that all operating systems are designed this way.
For Joerg's reference, open() goes like this:
1. the /dev name
2. the inode
3. the device number
4. pointers to structs full of function pointers
Nowhere is it in B/T/L form.
