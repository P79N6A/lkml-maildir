That's very inefficient.

Ouch... that _VERY_ inefficient... and the HW flush on the 74xx may
be broken on some models afaik =P

It's unclear if stores will get straight to the coherency domain or not,
they may still be stuffed in a store queue... Though a sync would
probably flush it. Still, you should really try to get your code fixes
to just dcb{f,st}/icbi on the right instruction.
