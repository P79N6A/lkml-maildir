Subject: [patch 1/1] fix syscallN() macro errno value checking for i386
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The errno values which are visible for userspace are actually in the range 
-1 - -129, not until -128 (): this value was added:
#define	EKEYREJECTED	129	/* Key was rejected by service */
And this would break ucLibc (for what I heard).
This is just a quick-fix, because putting a macro inside errno.h instead of
having it copied in two places would be probably nicer.
However, I've heard by D. Howells it wasn't accepted, so this is the solution for now.
