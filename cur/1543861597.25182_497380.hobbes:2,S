Please, don't think so. The point is simpler. Linux has its own standard, 
which is a Unix one, openGL on X11 and then SDL. There is a kernel 
component to get 3d acceleration with openGL, which is DRM.
This standard is nice, and openGL is available also on windows, where 
doom3, quake4 and the like use it happily.
There is no point to introduce something different and to change this 
standard.
