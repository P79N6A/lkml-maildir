I have some similar considerations about how userspace should deal with that.
The behaviour of simply "cd file/" are not that robust, I fear ...

Well, *use cases* I can see. I'd like to use that - for loop mounting, 
archives, possibly using symlinks to remote filesystems "symlink1 => 
ssh:user@ip" (although that's possible with FUSE anyway - but would be 
possibly within a .zip, too), ...
But I'm not sure how to do the presentation to userspace *right*.
How about some special node in eg. /proc (or a new filesystem)?
Eg.
   /fileAsDir/etc/passwd/owner ...
would work for all *files*. For directories we do not know whether we're still 
climbing the hierarchy or would like to see meta-data.
Some way like a ".this" entry is not the Right Way IMO ...
Well, I cannot imagine a real good way to tell where I'd like to stop 
following the "normal" filesystem and go into the "generated" hierarchy ...
   /fileAsDir/level-3/usr/local/bin/owner
is not nice.

Phil
