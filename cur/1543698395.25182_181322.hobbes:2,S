Here's a slight cleanup of the above patch -- tested with the cs4232 driver.
Any additional testing would be appreciated.

In this case we could also just continue if the MPU device isn't present.  It
would probably be a good convention to do so because if, for whatever reason
(3rd party driver, resource conflicts, etc), the MPU device is busy in any
matched card id set, the entire probe would fail.
How about something like this? (untested)
