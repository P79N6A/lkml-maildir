This does kill ANY machine. Tested here with AIX and Solaris. System is
going out of memory, FDs etc. LA skyrockets to absolutely crazy figures (the
last I did see was 498) and system dies. You're lucky if you're able to
"killall in.ftpd", 'coz usually any attempt to run any program results in
"Unable to load interpreter"...
It's not that kernel dies, the system is simply goes outta resources...
