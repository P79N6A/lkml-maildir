Subject: [patch] inotify: make nr_watches unsigned

John,
Attached trivial patch makes nr_watches unsigned.  The value never goes
negative, so we might as well benefit from the increased ranged and
better defined overflow semantics.
Also, manipulating unsigned variables is quicker on all architectures
(modulo SH5, but they like to be rebels).
	Robert Love
Make nr_watches unsigned, or else.
