Thanks for the try, but unfortunately this does not solve the problem.
Please note that kmemcheck is an patch to the kernel; without it you
will never see the warning. You can pull it from
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/vegard/kmemcheck.git current
though it is unlikely that it will help you more than looking at the
code (or the report) will do.

Also, noticing your change, I can see why it makes no difference:
Pekka already found that it is walk_state->op that has the value of
0xf7c12ec6 (e.g. the pointer being dereferenced), so the test will
still succeed.
On the other hand, I have discovered what seems to be a deficiency in
kmemcheck (i.e. it might be my fault entirely), so it is possible that
the warning is bogus. Will send an update shortly.
