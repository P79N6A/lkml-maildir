	FTP-transfer of large file over loopback gives me about 80 MB/sec
	speeds at 2.4.0-test8 -- nor is the ESD bad sounding.
	However my Alpha has the SB support very bad sounding..
	It sounds like spectrum reversal, in fact -- first noticed
	when playing stereophonic MP3 with xmms, but when same file
	was played to .WAV file at an intel box (where it sounds quite
	ok), and that wav is play(1)ed at the alpha -- same bad sound.
