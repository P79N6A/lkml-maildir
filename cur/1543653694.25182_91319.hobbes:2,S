Maybe it is normal but this doesn't fix the depmod problem even with the new 
kernel, I have modprobe, rmod and so back but the package doesn't include 
depmod.
I am running debian unstable, many install scripts uses parameters that are 
not provided by this version (I think -l and -r).
Maybe this is only for debian so I have to wait for a patched package...
Is it a bug that all modules are in the same dir without subdirs ? It is hard 
to find them.
thanks
have fun
Felix
