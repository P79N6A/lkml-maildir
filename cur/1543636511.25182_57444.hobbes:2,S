After upgrading  from kernel 2.4.7-10smp to 2.4.9-34smp using the Red Hat
RPM downloaded from RH Network, the CPU count on the machine reported by
dmesg and listed in /proc/cpuinfo was 4 rather than the actual 2.
This has occured on all 4 Dell 2650's that I've installed this patch on.  I
don't have any other mult-processor machines available to test this with.
Things seem to run OK, but this is a bit ominous.  Has anyone seem this
problem with this or other PC Models?
Thanks,
Bob
