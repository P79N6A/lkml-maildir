But that's fine - at that point we're literally _supposed_ to drop 
characters: we have to, in order to see the EOLN.
But we're only supposed to drop characters IFF:
 - the buffer is full
 - we are in canon mode
 - we _still_ haven't seen a single EOLN in the whole buffer
If any of these three isn't true, we're not supposed to drop anything.
That's my argument.
