Those files are smallish routines that can't be sanely written in C, or (in
the case of the bootstrap stuff) are for running on the 8086 your latest
CPU thinks it is when booting. No support for that from gcc.

If they where around once, they have been long plastered over by patches
that make them useless now.

Probably never was. Only way out is as they say: "Use the source, Luke".
You'd better get a book on ia32 (caution, the intel sytax almost all are
written for is truly bletcherous, and does things just different enough
from the AT&T sytax gcc/the kernel uses to make your head spin when trying
to map back and forth). There was an HOWTO on assembly language programming
under Linux, haven't looked at it in a long time.

Now that is a good question... never used one in my life :-)
