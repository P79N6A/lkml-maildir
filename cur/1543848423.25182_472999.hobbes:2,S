One device-mapper table can contain two concatenated stripe targets.

dmraid is not the only user of device-mapper striping.  Userspace volume
managers may want to use all sorts of odd layouts quite legitimately.

The arguments are (1) to avoid the ambiguity I've discussed and (2) to avoid
the additional complexity the in-kernel striped target would require
(calculating a stripe size for the end of the device to override the one
supplied), when it's so simple for userspace to specify exactly what it
requires by using two targets.
