I see....
If one of the source/dest directories is an ancestor to the other
it gets _PARENT while the descendent gets _CHILD,
otherwise the destination gets _PARENT and the source gets _CHILD.
I guess the terms 'PARENT' and 'CHILD' refer more to the relationship
of the locks than the relationship of the directories.
(If the destination name exists, it gets locked with _NORMAL)
I still find the terminology a bit confusing.
 _GRANDPARENT -> _PARENT -> _NORMAL
would make more sense to me, but maybe it isn't that important.
Thanks for the explanation.
