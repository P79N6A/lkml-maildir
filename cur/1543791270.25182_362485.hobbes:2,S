What's the status of the patch? I didn't see it in base kernel.
We found another bug related with this issue. On UP system, if a CPU
enters 
'mwait_idle', it never leaves it, as the 'mwait_idle' loop will never
end.
Disabling preempt fixes the bug. Should I submit a patch just disabling
preempt in 'mwait_idle' or wait for your patch?
Thanks,
Shaohua
