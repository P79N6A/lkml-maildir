Solaris can't be recompiled UP AFIK. This whole discussion about UP
performance is almost pointless in linux since we have CONFIG_SMP and we
can recompile it.
Especially if what you care is the desktop (not the UP server), the only
kernel bits that matters for the desktop are the VM, the scheduler and
I/O latency and perpahs the clear_page too.  the rest is all a matter of
the X/kde/qt/glibc-dynamiclinking/opengl/memorybloatwithmultiplelibs/etc..
the kernel core-raw performance in the fast paths doesn't matter much for the
desktop, even if the syscall would be twice slower desktop users
wouldn't notice much.
