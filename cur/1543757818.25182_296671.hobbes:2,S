Bah, and I did send it to myself first, but I guess my mailer un-flowed it 
for me :-(.  I'll try to find a better mailer.

Er, yeah. Oops. 
*Is* there a sensible place to remove the symlink from, though?  Nobody 
seems to call subsystem_unregister(&block_subsys), which is the place I'd 
expect to add a call to, and I can't see anything that's otherwise 
obvious...
