Most of the current use once code is for the page cache, dd if=/dev/cdrom 
will read from the buffer cache, where the pages will take longer to age out. 
 One of the patches between 2.4.8pre7 and 2.4.8final seems to have helped a 
lot here, but I'm not sure which one it was (check out the 'still buffer 
cache problems' thread).  I'm also not sure if the speedup was intentional, 
so it might go away during future tweaks.
Rik also posted a patch in 2.4.8-ac5 that deactivates buffer cache pages 
after a threshold, which should help as well (and benefit reiserfs/ext3 in 
general).
