Sure but you keep old ones around once its stable. This is a completely
pointless conversation to have before 2.6.0-test kernels. There isnt a
stable in kernel dvb api yet because its not been shipped in a stable

(Although I'd note the api has been as stable if not more stable than
some in kernel stuff 8))
