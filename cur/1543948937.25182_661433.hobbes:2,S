Could you update the now obsolete documentation (perhaps just delete
the no longer correct remark):
Documentation/vm/numa_memory_policy.txt:
        MPOL_BIND:  This mode specifies that memory must come from the
        set of nodes specified by the policy.
            The memory policy APIs do not specify an order in which the nodes
            will be searched.  However, unlike "local allocation", the Bind
            policy does not consider the distance between the nodes.  Rather,
            allocations will fallback to the nodes specified by the policy in
            order of numeric node id.  Like everything in Linux, this is subject
            to change.
