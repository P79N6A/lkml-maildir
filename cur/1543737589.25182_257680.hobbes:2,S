Excellent point right back at you... I didn't notice that the ip_vs
work was rescheduling itself.
    Andrew> How does this look?
	+void cancel_rearming_delayed_workqueue(struct workqueue_struct *wq,
	+					struct work_struct *work)
	+{
	+	while (!cancel_delayed_work(work))
	+		flush_workqueue(wq);
	+}
Seems like it should work as long as (as you note) the work _always_
reschedules itself, and no one else ever tries to schedule the work.
Maybe it's easier to say that users of rearming delayed work just have
to have a "stop" flag somewhere?  I have a feeling that an API for
such a particular situation is just an invitation for foot-shooting.
