Patch 2/4: adds export-type information of each exported symbol in
	Module.symvers file.
Patch 3/4: Builds on functionality provided by patch 2. It prevents kbuild from
	   producing modules that won't load.
Patch 4/4: provides the report generation functionality, using the
	   functionality provided by patch 2.
	A report generated by executing 
		make allmodconfig
		make exportcheck
	is available at 
http://www.sudhaa.com/~ram/misc/new_export_report.txt
	This report lists:
	1. the usage count of all exported symbols by in-kernel modules.
	2. For each in-kernel module lists
		a) the in-kernel modules it depend on.
		b) list of exported symbols from that in-kernel modules it 
		   depend on.
	The same report can also be generated by executing from the top level
	directory:
		perl scripts/export_report.pl
