 Yes, it's rather confusing.  I was a bit concerned about forward
gotos which are not error handling/exit and possible needs for
unlikely()'s by putting error handling on hotter path, IOW, untaken
forward branch.  For the records, I think the likely/unlikely thingies
are ugly & over-optimization in many cases.
 However, your code is aesthetically much better.  If there are no
opjections regarding the forward non-error-exit jumps, I'll reorganize
the code mostly as you suggested in the next take of this patchset.
 Thanks a lot. :-)
