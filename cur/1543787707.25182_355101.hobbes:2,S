Subject: [PATCH] incrase usbdevfs bulk buffer size
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Increase the usbdevfs buffer size limit.
I hit this limit with running ehci in the VM. The a single ehci
qTD transfer buffer can be 5 pages long, that is 20K. The current devio bulk
transfer limit is 16K.  I am not sure why the bulk transfer limit
is 16K. I can complicate the user space part to work around that,
but it seems much simpler just allow usbdevfs to accept bigger buffers.
I did some limited usage test with ehci controller. It seems works for me,
it did use a bigger buffer and nothing blow up.
