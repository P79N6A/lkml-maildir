Oh yes but there has been an epidemic of timer problems (fast/slow, lost ticks 
etc) lately meaning the pm timer is being relied upon more and more.

Suggesting another timer source is ok in the warning I believe given massive 
amounts of wasted cpu.

Understood. Perhaps having an indirect function call set to either 
good_pmtmr() or bad_pmtmr() after checking would be preferable to a variable 
that is checked on each function call despite never changing.

Not personally but my ICH4 pm timer seems to work very well whereas Andi's 
apparently similar chipset exhibits terrible problems.
