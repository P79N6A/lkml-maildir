Not again... SUID 0 == capabilities, or sticky == capabilities is broken,
because it _can't_ be made to work right

If you are into paranoia enough to really want capabilities, you won't let
anything like that even near to your system, unless it simply ignores
capabilities. Capabilities can _only_ be granted by specific permission,
not by copying around or getting files over the network.

You can have both, but not via overloading of bits in the filesystem that
mean something entirely different and touching up the whole thing with
unsecure storing of permissions in the file itself.

I don't see how a system that handles capabilities in metadata is not
practical. Sure, you can't just tar up a bunch of files with capabilities
and restore them later with the current tar(1). You'd need a special tool
for that, just as you'd need a _very_ few other specialized tools. I don't
see the big difference in writing the tools for a new filesystem vs writing
them for a "permissions inside the file" approach. Sure, there might be a
few more tools to write, but they would be simpler, and need no stupid
tricks inside the kernel to do their work (How does ls(1) find out to whom
the ---s--x--x file for user root really belongs? What are its
capabilities?  What if the file is ---s------? Can I run it, as it really
belongs to me?)
As I see it, none of these kludges has any chance of getting by the head
hackers or Linus. The Linux way is doing things _right_, even if it hurts.
