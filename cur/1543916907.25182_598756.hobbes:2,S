LDFLAGS_MODULE are reserved for architectures and modules be external
or not should never ude LDFLAGS_MODULE.
And LDFALGS_$@ have never been documented to work for modules - dunno
where you have that from.
IIRC we only use LDFALGS_$@ in the ld macro to be used by bootloaders.

Have you read:
Documentation/kbuild/makfilefiles.txt?
Here it is documented how to use the relevant variables.

LDFLAGS are a kernel wide variable. Modules shall not fiddle with it!
From your description you want to add a specific set of options to
the linker in a specific Kbuild file.
This is what EXTRA_LDFLAGS are present to help you with.
As for the:
> # Deal with recursive depens of libraries
I am not sure what you mean (despite yout comprehensive description).
Please try if EXTRA_LDFLAGS := --start-group lib.a --end-group
will solve your need.
I'm afraid not due to the placement of the --start-group --end-group.
If this does not help you please give me specific examples of how
the ld command-line should be then I can see how we tweak kbuild
to help you.
