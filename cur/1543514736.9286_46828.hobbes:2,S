The Memory: line was long forgotten by _you_ .... :-)  That is the line
which I was referring to.
The length 0 memory region at 0 is nonsensical, and suggests either that
code was changed between 2.3.19 and 2.3.25-pre1 (I'm looking into that) or
that you have a sloppy bios.

what report are we talking about? The mem_init() of arch/i386/mm/init.c is
set like this:
high_memory = (void *) __va(max_low_pfn * PAGE_SIZE);
is this incorrect? It is incorrect on this specific system (Compaq 1600
dual PII 400) but is correct on some other specific system (IBM Netfinity
dual Xeon 450)
(I don't read/care about human-readable reports - I look at the value of
high_memory and it *is* incorrect (on some hardware)).
