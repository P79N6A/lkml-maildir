Hi,
regardless of the inconsistency you found; I think the behavior is
correct. "Legacy" binaries get read-implies-exec (since that is the old
behavior), "new" binaries get "we honor the stack you set". Why should
read-implies-exec be set when an application asks for an executable
stack? I disagree that it should be set; the application should just use
the proper PROT_EXEC flags for its allocations; now it's not an option
to fix legacy apps (the ones without the pt_gnu_stack marker), but for
new things for sure is/was; this has been the case for the last... 3+
years already.
So... fix the app ! (and.. which app is this ?)
