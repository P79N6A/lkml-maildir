The actual reason for a small timeout is if the system is in a 
high-throughput highly available application, to get the board out of 
commission as soon as possible and avoid a big delay in message handling 
and/or lose as little traffic as possible.  Or if the system can fail 
and start misbehaving, to kill it as soon as possible to minimize the 
damage.  With the preemptable kernel and real-time processes, it's not 
unreasonable to schedule something every 250ms.
