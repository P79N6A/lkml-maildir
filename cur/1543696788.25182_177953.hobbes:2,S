I'm a bit confused (not unusual). I think what I'm suggesting is exactly what 
you've just described and doesn't involve releasing any bk source; Release a 
binary only tool which will clone and pull only, (Ie can be used to access 
open source software but not develop it) which is free of the license 
restrictions of the full bk (ie can be used to access open source software by 
anybody, regardless of what they might be working on)
Or am I missing something? How does this hurt the bk business model?

Absolutely. Bk is, undeniably, brilliant, and would solve all these problems 
at a stroke, except that the open source community cannot with good 
conscience exclude *anyone* from being able to access the sources.
