This isn't related.  The problem you described can happen nearly as
easily on a non-preemptible system.  We have plenty of semaphores held
across schedules and there is no reason to single out ones that acquire
and release the semaphore in short, non-preemptible, sequences.  We
always have this "problem."
SCHED_IDLE is much different, as you know, because the SCHED_IDLE task
holding the lock can _never_ get scheduled if there is a CPU hog on the
system!  With the preemptive case, we only worry about an increase in
this period, which is at the expense of fairness in running higher
priority tasks.  But I think you know this ...
