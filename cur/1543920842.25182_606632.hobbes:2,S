Subject: [PATCH 0/3] ide: Fix use of paired device
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

At least 2 drivers (siimage and cs5535) have a bug where they use
the construct:
	ide_drive_t *pair	= &hwif->drives[drive->dn ^ 1];
To access the other drive in a master/slave pair. This is bogus
because drive->dn is not the unit number, but the global drive
number, thus can be 2 & 3 for ide1, 4 & 5 for ide2 etc...
This causes the driver to access beyond the drive array into lalaland
for any other interface than ide0 and in some case, actually crash :-)
These 3 patches fix those by introducing a ide_get_paired_drive()
helper that does the right thing and then using it.
Please apply to 2.6.24 if no objection.
