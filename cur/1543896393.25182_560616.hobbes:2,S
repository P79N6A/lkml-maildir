I agree with this statement.  Imagine a proprietary private network where a 
device has been modified to run in an invisible promiscuous mode.  The device 
looks as if it isn't doing anything wrong, but is forwarding the network out 
another interface.  The only way to prevent that type of attack is to not allow 
unauthorized signed Kernels onto that network.
