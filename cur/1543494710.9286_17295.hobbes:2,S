Hi Fredrik,
	You're right, the 16750 autodetect is currently broken; the
problem with your fix is that there are some broken UART's out there
that will falsely autodetect as the 16750 with your change; yup, they're
broken, but this is the PC hardware market we're talking about.  There's
a lot of cheap, broken trash out there, and we have to do our best to
support it all....
	I *think* this autodetection code should do a better job of
avoiding the false positives while still correctly detecting the 16750.
Could you check and see if this properly detects your 16750 uart?
Thanks!!

Replace the relevant 16750 detection code in autoconfig() with the
following:
	if (state->type == PORT_16550A) {
		/* Check for TI 16750 */
		serial_outp(info, UART_LCR, scratch2 | UART_LCR_DLAB);
		serial_outp(info, UART_FCR,
			    UART_FCR_ENABLE_FIFO | UART_FCR7_64BYTE);
		scratch = serial_in(info, UART_IIR) >> 5;
		if (scratch == 7) {
			/*
			 * If this is a 16750, and not a cheap UART
			 * clone, then it should only go into 64 byte
			 * mode if the UART_FCR7_64BYTE bit was set
			 * while UART_LCR_DLAB was latched.
			 */
 			serial_outp(info, UART_FCR, UART_FCR_ENABLE_FIFO);
			serial_outp(info, UART_LCR, 0);
			serial_outp(info, UART_FCR,
				    UART_FCR_ENABLE_FIFO | UART_FCR7_64BYTE);
			scratch = serial_in(info, UART_IIR) >> 5;
			if (scratch == 6)
				state->type = PORT_16750;
		}
		serial_outp(info, UART_FCR, UART_FCR_ENABLE_FIFO);
	}
