If it's gathering its entropy from the network, it is not a QUAL_LOW
RNG because it is not a hardware random number generator at all!
Such a device is QUAL_PSEUDO or QUAL_UNKNOWN. If it's known or
suspected to be bogus, it should be so marked. 
Once you've merged your LOW class with PSEUDO, you're left with a
meaningless, unquantifiable distinction between NORMAL and HIGH.
So we're down to one bit distinguishing real RNGs from pseudo RNGs.
