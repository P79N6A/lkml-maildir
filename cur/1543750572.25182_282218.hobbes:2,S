Hi all, I have more 2.5isms for the list.  ./fs/binfmt_elf.c:
  #ifdef CONFIG_X86_HT
                  /*
                   * In some cases (e.g. Hyper-Threading), we want to avoid L1
                   * evictions by the processes running on the same package. One
                   * thing we can do is to shuffle the initial stack for them.
                   *
                   * The conditionals here are unneeded, but kept in to make the
                   * code behaviour the same as pre change unless we have
                   * hyperthreaded processors. This should be cleaned up
                   * before 2.6
                   */
                  if (smp_num_siblings > 1)
                          STACK_ALLOC(p, ((current->pid % 64) << 7));
  #endif
Happy y2k5,
Justin
