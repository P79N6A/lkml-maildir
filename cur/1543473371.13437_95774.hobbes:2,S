Currently the kernel (kmod) execs /sbin/modprobe (or whatever is in
/proc/sys/kernel/modprobe). It uses kernel_thread() to create
a kernel thread that executes exec_modprobe() function which then uses
execve() in the following manner (see kernel/kmod.c):
        /* Go, go, go... */
        if (execve(modprobe_path, argv, envp) < 0) {
                printk(KERN_ERR
                       "kmod: failed to exec %s -s -k %s, errno = %d\n",
                        modprobe_path, (char*) module_name, errno);
                return -errno;
        }
Of course, in order for this to be valid it has to do some tricky things
like set_fs(KERNEL_DS) to allow environment to be in kernel segment.
