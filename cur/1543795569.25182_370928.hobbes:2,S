We can use any random value instead of EXIT_DEAD (except RUNNING,INTERRUPTIBLE,
and UNINTERRUPTIBLE). The only reason for changing the state's value is this
check below:
	if (->state && !PREEMPT_ACTIVE) {
		...
		deactivate_task();
	}
This state is invisible to proc/array.c because yes, we already have something
in ->exit_state.
We can add new TASK_DEAD or something for that. Or we can do:
-	if (prev->state && !(preempt_count() & PREEMPT_ACTIVE)) {
+	// PF_DEAD means that preemption was disabled
+	if (PF_DEAD || (prev->state && !(preempt_count() & PREEMPT_ACTIVE))) {
but this is so ugly.

No, it could be EXIT_ZOMBIE if the task was not auto-reaped. So the task
should be deactivated when ->exit_state != 0. But see below.

No, I don't think this is right. After exit_notify() sets ->exit_state this
process is still valid from the scheduler POV, it may be preempted, may sleep.
So I beleive we really need to do something special when exiting process does
it's last context switch from do_exit(). If the process enters schedule() in
TASK_RUNNUNG, we should pass the hint to scheduler - PF_DEAD. Or we can change
the ->state before calling schedule().
