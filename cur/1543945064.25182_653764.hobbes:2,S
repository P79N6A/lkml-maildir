Right but if the system starts reclaiming pages of the application then we 
have a memory shortage. So the user should address that by not running 
other apps concurrently. The stopping of all connections is still better 
than the VM getting into major trouble. And the stopping of connections in 
order to move the process memory into a more advantageous memory location 
(f.e. using page migration) or stopping of connections in order to be able 
to move the process memory out of a range of failing memory is certainly 
good.
