I'm CCing this to the LKML, because it's useful to the list in  
general and you're much more likely to get useful replies as well.

Umm, hmm.  This really depends on a bunch of stuff I don't really  
understand all that well, but I'll try :-D.  The simplest way to do  
it would be to just stick each distinct value in a sysfs file and let  
your GPS software read each one and do what it wants from them.  That  
would make it really easy to shell-script with GPS coordinates too :- 
D.  Others on the list may have more informative/useful responses  
here, sorry!
Cheers,

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to  
make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the  
other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious  
deficiencies.  The first method is far more difficult.
