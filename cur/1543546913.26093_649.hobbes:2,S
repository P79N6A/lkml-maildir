Subject: 64bit BAR bug in pci.c

   I believe I've come across a small piece of broken code for 64bit BAR
support in drivers/pci/pci.c.  In the function pci_read_bases(), after
we determine we have a 64bit BAR we read the upper 32bits into variable
l.
We then get the size mask and save it into variable tmp.  However, we
then go back and use l to calculate the new size of the range.  I
propose
the diff below to fix this.  I'm unable to test this code, but if anyone
can, I'd appreciate some feedback.  I'm not on the linux-kernel list,
so please be sure I'm cc'd on any follow up.  Thanks,
	Alex Williamson
