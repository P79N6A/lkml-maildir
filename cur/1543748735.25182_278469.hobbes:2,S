Dear Grant, 
I am happy to help and to see my feedback was indeed useful. First I
would like to add to my first message, that I have observed a kind of
freezing for several seconds (5-10 seconds) of Firefox with one
particular web-page which heavily uses a flashplayer- and jave-plugin.
This does not appear in exactly the same form up to 2.6.10-rc2 but the
web-page under consideration is always kind of "heavy" and difficult to
load even with a high-speed connection.

I have applied this modification to the file "drivers/net/tulip/tulip.h"
and recompiled the modules. 
I have activated and deactivated three times the device eth1 (by "dhcpcd
eth1" and "dhcpcd -k eth1") attached to the tulip driver and the result
in /var/log/messages is:

The message with "tulip_stop_rxtx() failed" appears each time I activate
and deactivate the device. The values of CSR5 and CSR6 are reproduceable
but different for activation and deactivation:
  activation: (CSR5 0xfc664010 CSR6 0xff972113)
deactivation: (CSR5 0xfc06c012 CSR6 0xff970111)
I have also joined the output of /proc/pci for the network card in case
it may contain some useful information:
  Bus  0, device  14, function  0:
    Ethernet controller: Linksys NC100 Network Everywhere Fast Ethernet 10/100 (rev 17).
      IRQ 10.
      Master Capable.  Latency=32.  Min Gnt=255.Max Lat=255.
      I/O at 0xa400 [0xa4ff].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe0000000 [0xe00003ff].
Greetings, Klaus.
