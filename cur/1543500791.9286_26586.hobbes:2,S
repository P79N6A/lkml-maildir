I think that returning errors is WRONG,
unless specifically requested by fnctl().
It means that processes will get unexpected errors
from otherwise validly open filedescriptor.
It means that you can't fix the problem with the filesystem
and resume operations nicely afterwards;
or you will have to manually stop processes from userland before unmounting,
which would not be atomic and generate yet another race condition.
Robert seemed to favor atomically stopping processes.
I am personally in favor of defaulting to a blocking behavior.

That's typical incremental behavior. Again, it's a matter of tradeoff:
do you want a big atomic operation once in a while and
simple operations every time, or complex incremental operations every time?
It's real-time response vs overall-time duration.
See GC for a field of CS where this trade-off has been beaten to death.
Also, the worry was most important in the case
of atomically stopping processes as recommended by Robert.
Hum. It looks like the need to avoid losing file descriptor information
and pending I/O requests would make it a good idea that there be a
mount mode without either read or write permissions,
similarly to opening files without read or write permissions.
Looks to me like an interesting alternative to deadfs, anyway...

Hum. Let's just send those kiddies to /dev/null; uh, I mean, er, whatever.

My opinions may have changed, but not the fact that I am right.
