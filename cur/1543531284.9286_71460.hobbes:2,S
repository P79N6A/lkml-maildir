Explain what overcommiting has to do with avoiding DoS. Under flood,
your (non overcommiting) system won't serve any legitimate request 
(e.g. won't spawn other servers) because of OOS (just like mine).
Unless you're actively protecting against floods, the DoS succeeds.
And if you implement some kind of defence against DoS, I can do also.
The only difference is that you're serving 100 requests, me 300.
If your database leaves behind corrupted data, upgrade to a real
transaction-based system. You should do it anyway. 
If someone stole your credit card file, accounting won't help much.
Hire some security expert.
Don't mix things up. Overcommitting systems do not crash (because of
overcommitting). Random crashes are bad, sure. Random crashes on critical
system with no backup, no real database engine, no security help save
the World from clueless sysadmins. This has nothing to do with
overcommitting.
AFAIK, system crashes (with Rik's OMM killer) because of init being
killed are impossible.

Againg you're mixing things up. You're right: perfectly tuned ==> 
perfect users. Do you run your critical accounting system on the same
Unix box you use to give free Unix accounts to random users? 
You shouldn't. And even if you do, do you *really* think that an
overcommitting kernel is your *major* problem? No matter how many different
kind of quotas you set up, I'll never call that a "perfectly tuned" system.
Run your accounting database on a dedicated system. One user only. You.
The more perfect user in the World. Never disagrees with sysadm. B-)
"Connections" are not "users", BTW. If you run a server which has no
means to control its own behaviour, blame the programmer.
And, on the server example, i'd even turn swap off. The system should 
not page at all. If it *starts* paging, you're already in trouble.
On high performance systems, memory accesses should be just that.
You don't want to pay the overload of a page-fault. Your server should be
carefully tuned to avoid paging at all. So no OMM.
