Can I plead alzheimers or something?  Working with ancient grey matter

I don't ATM recall exactly where I first heard or read about this.
Maybe in the libusb docs?  No, not a thing, even clear back up to the 
root dir of the libusb archive.  Maybe I got it from the sane list?
In any event, thats too damned hard to find and if the libusb author 
is copying the mail here, that little detail really should be added 
to the README and/or INSTALL.libusb raw text files, or to a FAQ on 
the libusb website, the quicker of the two alternatives if this 
version of the library is stable (and it seems so to me).
The authors doc/html files are quite complete, I just read them all, 
but they attack *only* the api the programmer would use, and the 
actual non-programming user who just wants to use his scanner with 
this new-fangled system gets hung out to dry.  This question gets 
asked, and answered the same way, many times on the sane list too.
It may have been added to the sane-backend docs in a recent version, 
I'm at least one version out of date here, not being inclined to "fix 
something thats not broken" at my home site. :-)
