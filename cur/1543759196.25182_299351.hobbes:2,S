It depends who gets to Linus's tree first.  If linux-release merges first,
I just revert the temp fix while adding the real fix.  But the temp fix
should never have gone into Linus's tree in the first place.
If I merge before linux-release, I guess Linus has some conflict resolving
to do when he pulls from linux-release.  That's OK for an obvious
two-liner, but would get out of control for more substantial things.
Neither solution is acceptable, really.  I suspect the idea of pulling
linux-release into mainline won't work very well, and that making it a
backport tree would be more practical.
