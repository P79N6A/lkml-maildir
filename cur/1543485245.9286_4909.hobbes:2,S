2.2.1, on 16Mb ram.
After an unfortunate incident, that seems fortunately not to have harmed
my system, I wanted to check my hard drives.
However, when I did badblocks -w /dev/xxx count>40000, the system became very
unresponsive, (0.2-0.5 seconds for a char to be echoed on a text vc), and
then started killing stuff, beginning with my webcache, and continuing with
inetd, update, and after a few seconds init.
Fortunately, a shell stayed live, so I was able to shutdown gracefully.
Badblocks in write mode 
does: write 1024 bytes of data, lseek 1024 bytes into the file, write 1024,
      lseek 2048, .....
Happens with dma on, or off, on two seperate (quantum bigfoot) drives, X
running or not, kernel compile running or not.
Virgin 2.2.1 tree, nothing overly strange on .config, though that can 
be supplied of course, if needed.
