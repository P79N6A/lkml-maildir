Only few libc5 programs are affected in fact (one with IPC usage).

If program is created that way it's broken already :-)

It CAN be enough right now for everyone. But it's clear that in just few short
years it'll not be enough for lots of big servers (right now servers with
NR_TASKS=512 are useless and even NR_TASKS=1024 is often not enough; 4000
usually works... but 32000 is just 8 times more then 4000 ! and will be not
enough LONG before 32bit processors will be obsoleted).

Then it should be fixed. And it'll be fixed. Epsecially since each THREAD in
linux need unique PID 32000 is not much...

get_pid() and sheduler should be fixed of course. But they can be fixed later.
It does not require ABI change :-)

IMO it's way to go. We do not need more then 2000000000 processes even on
64bit platforms but who knows what will be done in next 20 years+ ?
