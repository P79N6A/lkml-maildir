The only way to tell for certain in some particular case (like yours) 
is to use a USB bus analyzer.  However you probably don't care too much 
about the cause, so long as you can fix it.  Have you tried using a 
different flash drive?

That's fine for you.  But once the code is in the kernel, it affects 
everybody -- including people who don't have dedicated servers with 
closed and locked chassis.
My personal opinion is that it's somewhat distasteful to add software
workarounds for problems caused by bad hardware, unless it's really
impractical to fix or replace the hardware.  But to each his own...
