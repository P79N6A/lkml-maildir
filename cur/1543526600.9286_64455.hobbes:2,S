This sounds resonable. Any ideas about where to look for the cause of this
misalignment so that it could be permanently fixed?

A hardware problem also sounds highly unlikely to me, as I have 3 identical
DE500-BA cards in the machine, and they all give this error (the cards where
all purchased from different vendors, so something like 3 cards from the
same bad shipment can be probably be eliminated as the cause of this). Each
of the 3 cards is connected to different networks; one is connected to a
100mb/sec IBM switch, one to a 10mb/sec IBM hub and the last to a 10mb/sec
HP hub - so I don't think the cause of the problem is the equipment the
cards are connected to either.

I agree, I have not had any problems with this 'wrong data byte #8' problem
apart from the messages and one attempt to run the Squid 2.3STABLE1 proxy
server. The Squid compiles and installs just fine but when I start it up it
runs fine for about 2 to 3 minutes, and then the NIC's "shutdown" and I have
to do "ifconfig eth[012] down ; ifconfig eth[012] up" to get the cards
working again. All other software runs fine (at least so far - this server
has only been up and running (Linux) for a few days).

Maybe. But I had this server running Digital UNIX for about 6 months with
the same NIC's, and Digital UNIX never showed a simmilar problem. So it has
to have something to do with how Linux handles the hardware. Either Digital
UNIX contain a workaround for a known problem, or Linux handles the hardware
wrongly.

That's what I'd like to know as well. I'll be more than happy to test out
patches and provide any needed information!
