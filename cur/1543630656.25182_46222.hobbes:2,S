disagreement, my initrd is not the problem. the kernel code is really
explicit about what it will do with the real root fs, it will mount it
by itself, I am definitely not required to mount it by myself within
linuxrc, for sure not to workaround a bug in the kernel, and now in
2.4.19pre mounting it in linuxrc is even worse idea because the mount
will likely fail at the first different mount option. linuxrc is allowed
to just run exit(2) and the real root fs must still be mouned correctly,
that is the linuxrc API.

I don't care about this part, if it gets changed I will update my
initscripts to act accordingly, however requiring all linux users to
update their init scripts in mid/late 2.4 is probably not a good idea,
if you really want to drop such two lines then do it in 2.5 only (not
recommended, still it's a gratuitous API change IMHO).
