This sounds like a very different issue than what I thought you said 
originally. Your other message said a "find over the sysfs tree", 
implying some sort of tree-wide search for relevant information. In 
fact, the "find" is only for attributes in the directory owned by the 
kobject, right? Once they have been "found", they will age out of the 
dentry/inode cache just like any other search results.

I agree, that would be difficult and hard to manage.
