I am not sure about the chip-set but I think it was vt82c686b. It used 
the via82cxxx-driver, but only _after_ using the generic ide-code to 
probe/wait (a long time) for the disks. (This was in Suse 10.1 SP 1.)

Sorry. :( I don't have access to the hardware anymore (which is a 
"home-made" embedded machine). But from what I could get from poking 
around was that the BSY-bit on the slave (that never has or ever will 
exists) was set, probably because those who built the thing wanted to 
save money and/or space on that "billionth of a cent"-resistor that Alan 
Cox talked about.

It didn't stall for me... But even if it had, probe_hwif() will ignore 
the entire controller if you set "idex=noprobe".
(From drivers/ide/ide-probe.c)

Great comment. :) I'll change that right away...

Mmmm, yes, I know. But I couldn't come up with a clean and nice way to 
be sure that the first drive is selected. Maybe I could move it inside 
the if-statement below?
