I have a concern with ipv6 multicast!! But I don't know "linux
forwarding" well
I inserted 2 lines in ip6_mc_input()
	....
	if (ipv6_chk_mcast_addr(skb->dev, &hdr->daddr))
		deliver =1;
	>>if (ipv6_devconf.forwarding == 1)
	>>	ip6_mc_forward(skb, deliver);
	if (deliver)
		discard = 0;
		ip6_input(skb);
	}
	......
I made ip6_mc_forward() which was modified from ip6_forward().
But it doesn't work...
How do I make ip6_mc_forward()? 
I want simple ipv6 multicast forward... 
  When host receive multicast packet, host forward it without multicast
routing cache..
  Then I will filter unneeded packets.
Nobody help me??
Thank you!!
