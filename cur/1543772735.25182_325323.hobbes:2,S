I'm tell'n you that there is no way that this patch is going to
die. The commercial vendors and the general community is going
use this once they figure out what it can do and there will be
no stopping it. You can bet on some body extremity that this
will happen. It's inevitable and ultimately the future of Linux
whether they like it or not.
