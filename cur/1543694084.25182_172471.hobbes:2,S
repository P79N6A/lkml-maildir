I don't know anything about it, but I don't see what exactly you'd be
trying to predict: the kernel's scheduler _dictates_ scheduling behaviour,
obviously. Also, "best use of system resources" wrt scheduling is a big
ask considering there isn't one ideal scheduling pattern for all but the
most trivial loads, even on a single processor computer (fairness, latency,
priority, thoughput, etc). Its difficult to even say one pattern is better
than another.
