true, DBG() in this case would expand to printk(), which returns int.
But in practice, DBG isn't used in any expressions -- and the other zillion
places in the kernel where it is used, it is used as in dave's patch.
Indeed, I don't see printk used in expressions either...
While I know it is common Linux style, and by default it is okay with gcc,
it seems somewhat half-baked to call functions and not check their return
value by default.  IMHO, if they return something, it should be checked,
or explicitly ignored -- or it shouldn't return anything in the first place...

whelp, it seems that the reason for this patch is this:
#define DBG()
if(...)
	DBG();
next_c_statement
which turns into
if(...) ;
next_c_statement
But since there is an intervening ';', this code is still functionally correct
and a decent compiler will delete the test altogether, yes?
So is there some real problem here that I missed,
or is this to make some code-checking tool that I don't have happy?
thanks,
