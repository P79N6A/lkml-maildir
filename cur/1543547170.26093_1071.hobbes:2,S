	i agree with Alan, and for more than just the above reason.  One of
the rules of thumb where i work is "keep that sh*t out of our kernel!".  i
don't see what the problem is with just putting the config file in a common
place and adding an extension to the end of it, ie
/boot/config-2.4.0-test1-dbg.  And it works for the argument of different
kernel configs with the same kernel version.  Since you will probably be
changing the EXTRAVERSION variable anyway (to differentiate between different
kernels, System.maps, and module dirs), just add the full version info to 
the end of the name of the config file.  A lot of distributions do it this
way, and i've never had problems with it.
	As for the argument of putting it in the kernel being more robust and
idiot-proof, well, if someone can't keep three files and one directory 
straight for each different configuration of the kernel that they want to 
play with, they probably shouldn't be configuring and compiling kernels in 
the first place.  You can't idiot-proof the world, and even if you could, some
things really shouldn't be.
