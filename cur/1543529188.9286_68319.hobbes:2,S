If you want to split hairs I could say I don't know what architecture your
i686 is? One of the architectures in the standard Linux kernel tree is
listed as "i386" (without the quotes), but there is no i686.

So what you are saying is that there is no dependance on the BIOS at all or
for the keyboard/mouse/serial/parallel part only?

Turning off PNP in an i386 BIOS usually means turning off ISA PNP and as far
as I can see we don't limit ourselves to just that.
What you are saying above is that the PNP code *is* dependant on the BIOS and
that is what worries me because it makes it pretty non-general. I also have
an AXP (UDB/Multia) where I can't set anything in the BIOS (or whatever you
call it there), but I still have both PCI and IDE busses. Incidentally, that
machine is pretty limited, eg. with only one PCI slot so I have no problems 
with resource conflicts, but it is also a bad reference system for that
purpose. The PC I mentioned above has almost everything and every IRQ is or
should be in use, so there I need the management that I hoped PNP could or
eventually will provide.
And then you are telling me that some drivers use and some don't use the
services provided by PNP and that I can override bad info on the command line
with some drivers? But I don't think that a driver can or should change
for example the IRQ, DMA or IO port the physical device has been initialized
with, because that is what the PNP code does, right?

I don't exactly know what an APIC is.

Yes, and that is where I am told I have conflicts, in my case an IRQ.

Linux version 2.3.50 on an i386 machine (466.94 BogoMips). And what does that
tell us? :-)
