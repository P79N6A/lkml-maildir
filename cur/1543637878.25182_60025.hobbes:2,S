I think this would be the cleanest method as well.  Especially when we
recognize that the asm-ppc/serial.h situation will only get worse
over time.  Every embedded PPC board designer has a unique location
for his 16550 UART(s) and we just keep adding more preprocessor
cruft for each port.  This should let us keep this board-specific
info in our board port files...more abstraction=good.
