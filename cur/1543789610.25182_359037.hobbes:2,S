Yes.

Not really as much. Note also that with latest mainline the ppc64 kernel
was going well even without this patch, it was some older codebase
falling apart, primarly because it was still doing pte_establish there
see:
	young_entry = pte_mkyoung(entry);
	if (!pte_same(young_entry, entry)) {
		ptep_establish(vma, address, pte, young_entry);
		update_mmu_cache(vma, address, young_entry);
		lazy_mmu_prot_update(young_entry);
	}
So those flush actions were a bottleneck when executed by all cpus at
the same time. But some archs still implement it like with the old
codebase, and the patch is quite an obvious optimization that can
clearly avoid useless tlb flushes (and that fixed the problem completely
with the older codebase still dong ptep_establish even on ppc64).
