Well, I gave a try to last -mm tree. The bot seemed good till it got to
LVM stuff. Vgchange does not find any volume groups. I can't say much because
lvm is pretty "early stuff" on this box; so it is pretty unusable. All I know
for now, as I changed a little my boot scripts to be more verbose, is that
vgchange -avvv y returns this kind of message: 
hdXN: cannot read LABEL
and this message for all parts it can test....
As I need this box up and running, I came back to 2.6.9-rc3-mm3 (it works
pretty well). I will be able to run more tests on it, tomorrow but for now
that's all I can provide.
Oh and dmesg didn't have any oops or BUG in it, and seemed quite usual,
in IDE detection and settings messages and device-mapper messages.
However, I use dm-crypt to encrypt my / (no initrd, just initramfs) and
it works under 2.6.9-mm1, so the bug is likely to be in IDE stuff.
Sorry, for not being able to provide more infos. I will see if I can try on
another LVM'ed box but not for critical stuff.
Mathieu
