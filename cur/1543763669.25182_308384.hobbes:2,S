Have you looked at kmem_cache_alloc? kmalloc(1024, GFP_KERNEL) is 
compile-time replaced with the appropriate kmem_cache_alloc call. And 
the fast path within kmem_cache_alloc is 17 instructions long. Best 
case: uniprocessor, no regparams. Unfortunately with cli and popfd, thus 
something like 35 cpu cycles on an Athlon 64.

Yes - sem or spin locks are quicker as long as no cache line transfers 
are necessary. If the semaphore is accessed by multiple cpus, then 
kmalloc would be faster: slab tries hard to avoid taking global locks. 
I'm not speaking about contention, just the cache line ping pong for 
acquiring a free semaphore.
