Do you really want to start using fds instead of strings for tree
modifying commands (link, unlink, symlink, rename, mount and umount)?
Even if it were possible in the new_mount case it wouldn't have the
atomic lookup+act nature of the old mount.  And then, _I_ would
prefer a uniform interface for tree management commands - strings.
Ciao, ET.
