I certainly understand the issues of deep vs shallow copy. What I'm
saying is we should try to avoid needing deep copies in the first
place. They invite lots of complexity and for something as
straightforward as a cipher or digest should not be necessary.

Some way of preventing copies of some TFMs is called for, agreed.
