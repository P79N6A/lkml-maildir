the idea to transfer a simples task is:
Thread1 in NODE A    <-------TCP CONN----------->   Thread2 in NODE B
__________________				     __________________
- select task by pid			              -verify the availability  of these virtual addresses.
						      if it busy , free the memory of these virtual addresses.
- get structs mm , vma , task , zone , page					      
  and copy all buffers existing in the 	
  memory.	    				       -alloc all the buffer of task.
 		      					
							
- send all buffers to thread2			     -re-build structs (alloc_task_struct,page_zone,pte_page...)
 					     
						     -INIT_LIST_HEAD()
						     
						     -wake_up_process()
-send all virtual addresses to thread2
