No, the generic serial _console_ is polled and should require no more 
infrastructure than the early_console version which it strongly resembles.
After all, it's generally called from console_init(), at which point 
there's little more infrastructure available than in setup_arch() _anyway_.
You should happily be able to call serial8250_console_init() earlier then
console_init() currently does.
(Btw, if you're playing with this code I posted a cleanup to all the 
horrible #ifdefs in console_init, converting it to the __initcall mechanism.
