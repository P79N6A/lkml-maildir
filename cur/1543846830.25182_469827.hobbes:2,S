See here ? you have 'only' 880212 kB of LOWMEM, and 66 MB free.
all kernel structures (you can see them in /proc/slabinfo) are lying on this 
zone, no matter you add RAM on your machine (more RAM end up in HighMEM zone, 
wich is basically unused on your setup)
Since you have a 64bits CPU, your best move would be to use a 64bits kernel 
(you can keep all user land in 32bits mode)
With a 64bits kernel, kernel land structures would not be constrained in a 
small area, but can use full RAM.
I'm curious you have so many sockets but few entries in route cache... 
basically all connections come from few machines ?
