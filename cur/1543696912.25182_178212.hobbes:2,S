update, yes.  history, no, use bk/web.  diffs, no, use bk/web or bk.  building
it is certainly possible and you could do it yourself.  We already built the
cvs exporter which is a lot nicer than what you are asking for and building 
another thing for another 6 users seems pointless.  If you want to pay for the
engineering then contact me offline.
