Can you supply the contents of /proc/ide/amd74xx? That'd tell us whether
the cable type is detected correctly, etc.

It is possible, though only up to UDMA33.

The bus speed IS 33 MHz and it cannot be changed (unless you
overclock(ed) the processor. If you specify a faster speed (eg. 40 MHz),
the IDE controller will be set up for slower operation to compensate,
while the true speed will stay the same.
