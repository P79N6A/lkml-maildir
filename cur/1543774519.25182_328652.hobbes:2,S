Lots of people like corporate anonymity.  Some don't.  I don't.  I like
knowing who wrote what.  It helps me know who to pay how much.  It helps
me know who to forward the bug report to.   Losing your anonymity
exposes you, mostly for better since more communication is on balance a
good thing, but the fear is there for some.  I don't think we can agree
on this, it is an issue of the soul.
