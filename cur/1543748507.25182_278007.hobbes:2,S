 Well, some of these bridges may be used for peripheral devices (option
cards) built around a CPU, typically after reprogramming the class code to
something corresponding to their actual function.  Why should the address
decoder circuitry suddenly change in this case?
 Also even in the "host mode" another device may wish to examine what
resources have been reserved by the host bridge (unlikely, I admit, but 
in principle why not?).

 These are pre-2.0 PCI devices -- from before the detailed classification
was agreed upon.  AFAIK, just a couple of them exist -- I can name:  
Intel's 82424 and 82425 families of i486 host bridges, their 82375 family
of PCI-EISA bridges and their 82378/9 family of PCI-ISA bridges (also used
in a few DEC Alpha systems).  There are probably a handful of other chips,
all of them about ten years old.  Our i386 and ppc resource managers skip
over them as well and I suppose this is a safe default.  If any of them
needs BAR setup (none of these Intel ones), it can be added explicitly by
means of its vendor:device ID.
