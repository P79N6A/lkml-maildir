hm, agreed. I really sent it more as an RFC. The real fix is to do the 
disable_irq_handler()/enable_irq_handler() thing. [which is also a much 
nicer interface for more advanced MSI concepts]

yeah. How about the patch below? [builds and boots on x86, but no real 
irqpoll testing was done as i dont have such a problem-system.]

implement Alan's suggestion of irqpoll doing a second pass over
disabled irq lines if we didnt manage to handle the screaming
interrupt.
