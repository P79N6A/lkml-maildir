Sorry, no.
* this needs audit of all drivers. Or we can just merge it and then
fix all the problems it causes. If you are willing to become suspend
maintainer and handle all that mess, perhaps we can do this.
* it does not solve FUSE vs. hibernation
* it does not solve FUSE vs. suspend-to-both
* userspace will now see CPUs going up and down at minimum
Now, we want to do something like this long-term, but I do not think
we can just remove the freezer like this.
