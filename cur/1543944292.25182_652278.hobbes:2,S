The problem I see here is that the kernel tends to get badly confused
if one CPU just stops responding. At some point someone does an global
IPI and that then hangs.  You would need to hotunplug the CPU which
is theoretically possible, but quite intrusive. Or maybe the "isolate CPUs 
in cpusets" frame work someone posted recently on l-k could be used.  Still 
would probably have all kinds of tricky issues and races.
