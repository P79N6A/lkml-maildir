While printing with latest hpijs-1.2.2-rss.1 (patched for older HP9xx 
printers) at 1200x1200 DPI on 2.5.40-ac3 I found critical bug in the 
"mousedev" module.
Symptoms:
Total system hang.
Nothing in the logs :-(
Reboot
CUPS restart and boom, again and again,...
Then I went back to 2.4.19-ck5 and boom...
Several hpijs-1.2.1/1.2.2 versions rechecked. -> Nothing.
After some thought.
I have to use "mousedev" and "psmouse" modules since 2.5.40 (-ac3).
Commented both in my "/etc/rc.d/boot.local" file and started 2.4.19-ck5, 
again. Bingo ;-)
But what should I do with 2.5.40+?
I need my mouse.
System:
dual Athlon MP 1900+
MSI MS-6501 (aka K7D Master-L), Rev 1.0, AMD 760MPX
Regards,
	Dieter
BTW 2.5.40 is so GREAT on my mixed server/desktop/3D graphics devel maschine.
