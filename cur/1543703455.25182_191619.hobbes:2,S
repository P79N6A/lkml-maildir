Some motherboard BIOSes disable S.M.A.R.T. on drives connected to
their on-board controllers on each boot.  Quite possibly some PCI IDE
cards do as well.  It's possible, (but probably not likely), that by
trying the drive on different controllers a BIOS somewhere has
disabled S.M.A.R.T.

Quite possibly, but I can only really guess as to what that might be
at this point.
I _think_ that UDMA CRC checking is only done on data transfers, not
commands.  I've CC'ed Alan in the hope of getting some confirmation on
this.  Maybe a command being corrupted on the wire could theoretically
cause that error.
