the page allocator reserve only memory in order to swapout, that's
PF_MEMALLOC.
For other purposes not related to swapping (which is not a deterministic
thing, given there can be multiple layers of I/O and fs operations to
do), you should use mempool and change find_or_create_page to get your
reserved page as parameter.

when the machine runs oom the fs allocations means nothing. when the
machine runs oom is because somebody entered the malloc loop or
something like that. all allocations come from page faults.
Try yourself to run your box oom with getblk allocations. Only then
you'll run into the deadlock.
You've to keep in mind an oom condition happens once in a while, and
when it happens the userspace memory allocation load is huge compared to
any fs operation.

that's the PF_MEMALLOC path. A reservation already exists, or it would
never work since 2.2. PF_MEMALLOC and the min/2 watermark are meant to
allow writepage to allocate ram. however the amount reserved is limited,
so it's not perfect. The only way to make it perfect I believe is to
reserve the stuff inside the fs with mempools as described above.
