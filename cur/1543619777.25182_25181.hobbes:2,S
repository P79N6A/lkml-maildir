Why is this?
Is linus working toward what he believes will be a better impementation? Is
he just being stubborn?
I guess I just can't imagine any reason why he would want
large enterprise applications running poorly when there are obvious fixes.
Believe it or not, im not trying to start a flame war, just trying to
understand the logic.
