Subject: Kernel 2.4.8 - EMU10K1 - Kernel Compile Breaks in Module main.o
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/8/13/50

Problem:
Kernel compilation breaks with message
main.o(.modinfo+0x40): multiple definition of `__module_author'
Problem fix:
Delete the /usr/src/linux/drivers/sound/emu10k1 tree and copy the tree of 
kernel 2.4.7 into 2.4.8. Then it works.
Error Correction:
Please, review the changes made to emu10k1 by Robert Love announced in 
Changelog-2.4.8 under "final:"
Configuration file used for kernel compilation:
see attached text file "config.emu10k".
The contents of the config file has not changed since kernel 2.4.5 and worked 
for 2.4.6 and 2.4.7.
Error log (make modules):
see attached text file "module_emu10k.txt"
Thanks for your kind attention to this matter.
