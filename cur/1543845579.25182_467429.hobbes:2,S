Still there's absolutely no point in putting all this into mainline.  Do
it in your toy tree (whether it's called -rt or -pk :)) and keep one
stable implementation in mainline.  That one implementation should be
srcu capable rather sooner than later (as soon as you're satisfied with it)
because there's lots of interesting use cases for sleeping in RCU read
sections.  But until then keep the mainline code simple.
