If root has a process limit that make hotplug scripts fail to run, then
we're hosed in a lot of ways.  And if we fail to allocate memory, there
really ought to be some retry or something.  It seems to me that a failure
to run a hotplug script is a BAD THING.

But it is a violation of the affinity.  As the kernel we CAN NOT know what
the affinity really means.  Maybe there is some way for a task to indicate
it would like to receive SIGPWR in that case.  Or some other signal.  Can we
invent new signals?
That way a task that KNOWS about the CPU disappearing underneath it can be
wise, while everything else will not just get killed.
