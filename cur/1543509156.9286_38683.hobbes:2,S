Hi 
I looked for the requested information; there is absolutely nothing in
/proc/modules (empty) and standard gcc-Compiler.
System.map matches also kernel version, so I don't know where the
problem is based on.
Another strange thing is the behaviour I described while doing nfs
writing, which happened again this night.
