Depends on what you want to do.  If you want a stable kernel to use in
production you should probably pick the latest stable kernel
(currently that's 2.6.19.1).
If you want to help fix bugs, develop features, test etc, then it is
usually best to use the latest development snapshot available.  An
easy way to always have the tip of the tree available is to use git -
