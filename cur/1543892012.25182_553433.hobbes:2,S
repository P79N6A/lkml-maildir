Gaa ... Rusty surely you have more taste than that.
See include/asm-foo/ide.h
Add an lguest check to go with the pci check and for the lguest case just
say "no controllers"
Better yet just don't compile in the old IDE stuff, lguest doesn't have a
PCI or ISA bus anyway.
Alternatively make the IDE I/O space return 0xFF and it'll skip them
anyway.
