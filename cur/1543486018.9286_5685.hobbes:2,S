Unfsd has suffered from the same problem for ages. Caching open files,
dentries and the like is just bad.

4. Make one nfsd thread call svc_recv with a small timeout (e.g. 3 secs).
   If it doesn't receive a request within that interval, it will return
   with -EAGAIN.
   The timeout parameter was specifically added for cache flushing
   purposes.
