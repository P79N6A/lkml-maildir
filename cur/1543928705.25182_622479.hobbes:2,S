most of user-space is a 'leaf' node product, not infrastructure. The 
core infrastructure bits of userspace like glibc have a lot saner API 
practice than the kernel. (with a 10 times larger API exposure! There 
are 3000+ glibc APIs, contrast that with the few-hundred kernel APIs.)

what shocks me more is the wide gap between talk and deed ;-) Really, 
you had strong (and mostly unjust) words towards the containers stuff, 
with little constructive criticism - while what started out this 
discussion was your (in hindsight) shortsighted choice of mucking with 
/proc/self years ago. We all make mistakes but you seem to even be proud 
of it. If your goal is to bring Linux forward please become more 
constructive and cut out the insults towards others. (and you'll 
magically see less insults go in your general direction as well ;-)
