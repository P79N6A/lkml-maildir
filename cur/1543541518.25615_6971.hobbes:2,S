I agree 100%.
I do not like speciality access methods. I'd hate to have yet another
"ioctl"-like thing that does some magic to the file. It should be exported
as yet another byte stream, the way real UNIX data was always represented.
The UNIX notion of "everything is a file" is a thing of beauty. Plan-9
took it further, and I'm a staunch believer in things like /proc etc. I
don't think resource forks are anything special.

Indeed. We should look at this from an interface viewpoint: we don't care
_what_ the low-level filesystem actually does, but the interface should be
a generic and clean one that allows us to support different kinds of
filesystems. Ranging from the traditional UNIX ones that do not support
forks at all, to something that support "arbitrary" forks (ie forks that
don't have a fixed structure).
If a filesystem only supports a resource of a particular type, then that
filesystem won't support lseek() etc on that resource. Big deal. Named
pipes don't support lseek either. Neither do sockets etc. That doesn't
mean that they can't be accessed with read/write and friends.
