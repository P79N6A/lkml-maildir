Can't the argument be something like u64 instead of struct timespec,
regardless of this discussion (relative vs absolute)?
Compare:
 void mysleep(int msec) {
   struct timeval tv;
   tv.tv_sec = msec/1000;
   tv.tv_usec = msec%1000;
   select(0,0,0,0,&tv);
 }
with
  void mysleep(int msec) {
    poll(0, 0, msec*SOME_TIME_SCALE_VALUE);
  }
That to say: struct time{spec,val,whatever} is more difficult to use than
plain numbers.
But yes... existing struct timespec has an advantage of being already existed.
Oh well.
