Since loop-AES package now provides equivalent funtionality, it doesn't make
sense to maintain second package providing redundant functionality. The
merge was done because of difficulties getting versioned symbols to match
between two separately compiled packages. Even if separate package were to
be maintained (it won't be), it would not work well with versioned symbols.
If you want to blame someone for that, then blame mainline linux kbuild
guys.
I forgot to clearly say following in loop-AES-v3.2a README:
This command builds loop module with AES cipher integrated, as usual:
    make KEYSCRUB=y LINUX_SOURCE=/some/path/here
This command builds loop module with AES cipher integrated, and separate
twofish, serpent, and blowfish loop cipher modules:
    make KEYSCRUB=y EXTRA_CIPHERS=y LINUX_SOURCE=/some/path/here
This command builds only twofish, serpent, and blowfish loop cipher modules.
This assumes that kernel patch version of loop-AES is being used and is
enabled in kernel configuration:
    make EXTRA_CIPHERS=y BUILD_LOOP=n LINUX_SOURCE=/some/path/here
Key scrubbing, as enabled by KEYSCRUB=y make command line parameter,
currently only works for AES cipher. It has no effect on twofish, serpent,
and blowfish ciphers.
