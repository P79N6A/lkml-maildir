Almost every platform supports posted DMA ... its a property of most PCI
bridge chips.

This isn't possible on most platforms.  PCI write posting can only be
flushed by a read transaction on the device (or sometimes any device on
the bridge).  Either this interface is misnamed and misdescribed, or it
can't work for most systems.
