Subject: [PATCH] [RFC] fix missed SIGCONT cases

The SIGCONT-handling related comment in handle_stop_signal() states:
                         * If there is a handler for SIGCONT, we must make
                         * sure that no thread returns to user mode before
                         * we post the signal, in case it was the only
                         * thread eligible to run the signal handler--then
                         * it must not do anything between resuming and
                         * running the handler.  With the TIF_SIGPENDING
                         * flag set, the thread will pause and acquire the
                         * siglock that we hold now and until we've queued
                         * the pending signal.
                         *
                         * Wake up the stopped thread _after_ setting
                         * TIF_SIGPENDING
Unfortunately, just a few lines below, the siglock is unlocked for a short 
time, in order to call 
	do_notify_parent_cldstop(p, CLD_CONTINUED);
Therefore the synchronization on siglock doesn't work properly. If the 
task is waiting on siglock and gets scheduled when the siglock is 
unlocked, but before SIGCONT is queued (this is done later, after 
handle_stop_signal() finishes), the process misses the SIGCONT signal (as 
it has already run, but SIGCONT has not been queued yet).
This patch solves it by postponing the do_notify_parent_cldstop() call 
(and therefore also unlocking of siglock) until the SIGCONT is properly 
queued on the shared-pending queue, and therefore it is not missed by the 
process' SIGCONT handler. Also updates the callsites.
