This is not an option on IBM ThinkPads, unless you patch the DSDT on
non-ancient ACPI-based models, and unless you patch the BIOS (and maybe even
the EC control program) itself on the really ancient models.  It is that
simple.
On *new* Lenovo ThinkPad BIOSes (the z60 that Lenovo has given up on act
just like IBM ThinkPads), the firmware reports brightness changes through
the proper ACPI messages, which are processed by the ACPI video module. So I
will repeat myself here: brightness control is to be processed by the ACPI
video module, so brightness hot keys are not to be reported by default in
Lenovo thinkpads.
You want ACPI video to just pass the messages to userspace when X.org is
driving the backlight?  Fine with me.  That *still* doesn't make it right to
get these messages as hot key presses over the input layer through the
thinkpad-acpi driver.  So the NAK stands.  Any changes should be done to the
ACPI video driver in this case.
If the user has any real need to get these messages from thinkpad-acpi for
whichever particular reasons, he can use the standard interface to input
event drivers to remap the scan codes to whatever he wants.

Good luck, and please interface it properly to the backlight class while
at it.  There's no reason to make the waters mudier :-)
