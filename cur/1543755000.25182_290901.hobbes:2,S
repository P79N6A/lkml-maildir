Something changed in the Linus BK kernel in the last few days so that
I get "drivers/usb/input/hid-input.c: event field not found" in dmesg
everytime I move my MS Wheel mouse. Any ideas on how to get rid of
this?
The events are EV_MISC:
type 4 code 4 value 65585
type 4 code 4 value 65584
type 4 code 4 value 589825
