I don't understand at all.  We have an abstraction called packing
localities.  It is like your tar concept, but more flexible and
abstract...  I'll tell you more if you tell me my paper is unclear
(

) Are you sure your time wouldn't be better
spent improving reiserfs?  (We have some good fundamentals down, but we
sure need more tweaking and features.  You would certainly be an
asset....)
