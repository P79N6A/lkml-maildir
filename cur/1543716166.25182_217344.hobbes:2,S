During the 20% chance of it actually booting up, I've been able to
capture /proc/meminfo.  It reports MemTotal as 7642992 kB.  I've been
told that Tyan boards allocate almost 0.5GB for some reason for their
own use...  You can check out the logs I made from the bugzilla report I
sent to RedHat:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=121868
You'll notice that when it has 4GB in the system, the MemTotal is
3530868 kB...  The Rioworks board recognized close to the full amount
with both 4GB and 8GB installed.
I've also tested Mandrake 10.0rc1 and SuSE 9.0, and they have the same
issues that RedHat has...
