Subject: (Sparc64) 2.6.20 seems to ignore initramfs

On a Sun T1000 I am trying to boot 2.6.20 using initramfs. (I use the same 
procedure successfully on x86_64 and itanium2 servers).
The relevent silo section looks like this:
image=/boot/2.6.20.image
        label=2.6.20
        initrd=/boot/2.6.20.initramfs
        partition=2
        read-only
The kernel loads and boots and I see
Allocated 8 Megs of memory at 0x40000000 for kernel
Loaded kernel version 2.6.20
Loading initial ramdisk (127932430 bytes at 0x1000000 phys, 0x40C00000 
virt)...

Remapping the kernel... done.
Booting Linux...

VFS: Cannot open root device "<NULL>" or unknown-block(0,0)
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
 <0>Press Stop-A (L1-A) to return to the boot prom
So it knows about the initramfs, but then tries to mount a root filesystem 
instead...
I haven't tried this (initramfs)  with earlier kernels, so I don't know 
whether this is a regression. Any clues about how to solve this would be 
greatly appreciated.
