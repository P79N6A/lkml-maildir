It's a great question actually.

Because the conversion of memory allocation routines like kmalloc and kfree aren't
safely callable within a preempt_disable critical section since they were incompletely
converted in the -rt. It can run into the sleeping in atomic scenario which can result
in a deadlock since those routines use blocking locks internally in the implementation
now as a result of the spinlock_t conversion to blocking locks.

Right, blame it on the incomplete conversion of the kmalloc and friends. GFP_ATOMIC is
is kind of meaningless in the -rt tree and it might be a good thing to add something
like GFP_RT_ATOMIC for cases like this to be handled properly and restore that particular
semantic in a more meaningful way.

I'm not sure what mean here, but if you mean that you don't like the RCU API abuse then
I agree with you on that. However, Ingo disagrees and I'm not going to argue it with him.
Although, I'm not going stop you if you do. :)
