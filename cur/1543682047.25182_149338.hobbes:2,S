+  If you say Y here, then an OUI list (vendor unique ID's) will be
+  compiled into the ieee1394 module. This doesn't really do much
+  accept being able to display the vendor of a hardware node. The
+  downside is that it adds about 300k to the size of the module,
+  or kernel (depending on whether you compile ieee1394 as a
+  module, or static in the kernel).
+
+  This option is not needed for userspace programs like gscanbus
+  to show this information.
