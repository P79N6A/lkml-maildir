Unfortunately I don't think gcc 2.95 accepts that syntax.  For
example the following:
	void foo(void)
	{
		struct {
			struct {
				int y;
			} x;
		} bar = {
			.x.y = 1
		};
	}
gives
	a.c: In function `foo':
	a.c:8: unknown field `y' specified in initializer
when compiled with gcc 2.95.
I guess we could do
	.driver = { .name = "DAC960" },
but that seems silly as well.
