Details? Can the SCSI controller do the page clearing without any
donwside? I don't have the specs, sorry.
Obviously you _can't_ ask me to waste a SCSI disk (or the disk
throughtput) or the SCSI controller itself just to save some CPU cycle
(that once the page fault is completed won't bit me anymore).
If the NCR53c8xx controller can do that without any downside (except the
obvious PCI bus cycles to write to memory) just tell me how to do that and
I'll do of course. I have nothing against _removing_ the bzero cost
obviously.
I am against _moving_ the bzero cost in a not obvious place. Removing it
completly also automagically saving data-cache is a completly different
thing and I would like to do that of course (unfortunately only on
machines that have the magic NCR53c8xx).
