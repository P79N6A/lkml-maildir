I took ac's comment about '3rd party' sound drivers to heart, and
instead built a 2.2.1 kernel with SB support built in.
Sure'nuff, that took care of the oops. Sound in Quake2 now works great.
However, I can no longer play wav files (using the play command). I
can use x11amp to play mp3 files though. And when I try and record
from the /dev/dsp device via something simple like this:
	aurora:$ cat /dev/dsp > out
After about 7 seconds I get the message:
	cat: /dev/dsp: I/O error
My /dev/sndstat now looks like this:

Of course I would like to be able to play wav files again, as well as
record from the /dev/dsp or /dev/audio devices.
