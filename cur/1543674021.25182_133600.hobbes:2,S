Answering myself here.  Sanity-check me :)
According to mm/mmap.c, vma's are indeed shared among processes.
vma->shared is the list, and is maintained by __remove_shared_vm_struct()
and __vma_link_file().
The semaphore we should probably grab when messing with the key of a
shared area is actually its inode's sem, since vma doesn't have one.
inode->i_mapping->i_shared_sem, in the inode pointed by vma->vm_file.
If it doesn't exist, it probably means this vma has only one user.
Invalidating the vma key should probably occur in any place that
calls vma->vm_ops->close(), after this call.  We may want to add our own
refcount in vma, in case vm_file isn't available for extracting the
inode.
Just a thought: If we encrypt per-area, it might make more sense to go
down another level, to mm_struct.  It already has its refcount and
backpoints its users.  The key is valid iff the mm_struct is valid anyway,
so we may not have to track so many things ourselves.  Just allocate a
random key whenever mm_struct is allocated, and overwrite the key before
mm_struct is freed.  Any mm experts care to comment ?
