Exactly. Th ewhole point of this tree is that there shouldn't be anything 
questionable in it. All the patches are independent, and they are all 
trivial and small.
Which is not to say there couldn't be regressions even from trivial and 
small patches, and yes, there will be an outcry when there is, but we're 
talking minimizing the risk, not making it impossible.
