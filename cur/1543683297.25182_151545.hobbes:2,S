For me, all the Oxint Scheduler patches won't work well. Even for O8int I can 
say the same as for 01int to 07int, the system is dog slow when doing "make 
-j2 bzImage modules". XMMS does not skip, but hey, I don't care about XMMS 
skipping at all. I want a system which is responsive under heavy load, where 
opening an new xterm does not take 5-10 seconds, or writing an email in my MUA 
looks like a child is writing on a typewriter with one finger ;)
Now that I've tested 2.6.0-test-1-wli (William Lee Irwin's Tree) for over a 
week, I thought about, that the problem might _not_ be only the O(1) 
Scheduler, because -wli has changed almost nothing to the scheduler stuff, 
it's almost 2.6.0-test1 code and running that kernel, my system is _alot_ 
more responsive than 2.6.0-test1 or 2.6.0-test1-mm* or all the Oxint 
scheduler fixes have ever been.
Strange no?
P.S.: I've not tested Ingo's G3 scheduler fix yet. More to come.
ciao, Marc
