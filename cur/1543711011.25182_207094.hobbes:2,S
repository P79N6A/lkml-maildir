I applied your patch. The machine I checked (HP NetServer LC3, Pentium II)
now prints:
  nicstar0: PCI cache line size set incorrectly (0),
  setting cache line size to 8
when initializing the card.
Unfortunately, the patch does not fix the problem: My usual test
case, transferring data from Mcafee's ftp server, still doesn't
work.
