This means we need people who figure out who to assign bugs too.
Aka bugmasters.
In theory it could be nearly automated. Figure out what files related
to the bug and assign to the last 5 people who submitted patches
for them and/or signed off. 
Ok I suppose it's not that easy -- you would need some human judgement.
BTW one big problem in our current bugzilla is that a lot of people
cannot reassign bugs they don't own. I sometimes see bugs that I don't
own bug I know who is responsible, but bugzilla doesn't allow me to do it.
So I think what would help:
- Ask more people to just categorize and reassign bugs (anybody interested?)
- Give more people in bugzilla the power to reassign arbitary bugs
(bugzilla maintainers would need to do that)
