Lack of hysteresis can do that, with large swats of memory constantly 
being claimed and returned to the system.  One way to implement 
hysteresis would be based on a decaying peak-based threshold; 
unfortunately for optimal performance that requires the C runtime to 
have a notion of time, and in extreme cases even be able to do 
asynchronous deallocation, but in reality one can probably assume that 
the rate of malloc/free is roughly constant over time.
