My point was that most things we do add complexity to the codebase,
including the things you do yourself ... I'm not saying the we're worse
off for the changes you've made, by any means - I think they've been
mostly beneficial. I'm just pointing out that we ALL do it, so let us
not be too quick to judge when others propose adding something that does ;-)

I'll go look through Mel's current patchset again. I was under the
impression it didn't suffer from this problem, at least not as much
as zones did.
Nothing is guaranteed. You can shag the whole machine and/or VM in
any number of ways ... if we can significantly improve the probability 
of existing higher order allocs working, and new functionality has
an excellent probability of success, that's as good as you're going to 
get. Have a free "perfect is the enemy of good" Linus quote, on me ;-)
