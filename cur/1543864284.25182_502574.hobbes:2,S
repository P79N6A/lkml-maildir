Ok. But, mkswap man is old (1999). However, from Linux Partition HOWTO:
"footnote: "official" max swap size: With kernel 2.4, the limit is 64
swap spaces at a maximum of 64Gb each, although this is not reflected in
the man page for mkswap. With the 64 bit opteron on the 2.6 kernel, 128
swap areas are permitted, each a whopping 16 Tb! (thanks to Peter Chubb
for the calculation)"
I want to know: why 64 GB???
Thanks,
