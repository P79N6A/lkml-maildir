First the profile events are not exact. It could be an earlier instruction.
The reordering Window is relatively large (~80 macro ops) 
But let's assume it is this one.
Weird. Maybe it's a cache miss. Can you check with DATA_CACHE_MISSES ? 
Or possible a TLB miss, although that's far less likely (L1_AND_L2_DTLB_MISSES)

No, they are supposed to be one cycle only.

My first guess would be a cache miss of some sort.
Maybe the rest of the code needs enough cache to push this line out. 
Or since you got dual core with separated caches they are bouncing
for some reason (they shouldn't, but maybe there is a bug)

I doubt that will make much difference.
