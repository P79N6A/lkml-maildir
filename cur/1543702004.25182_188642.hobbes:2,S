It's ok. I fixed the code now[1] If you have other undocumented requirements
you should document them though, otherwise there may be more problems.
Since merging is disabled by default now it won't trigger anyways.
[1] will be in next merge after testing, the last patch i posted still
had one bug.

With the evil dma_length trick it is actually near zero cost.

I don't expect a significant performance hit.
