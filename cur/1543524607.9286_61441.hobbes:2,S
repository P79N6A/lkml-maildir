Hi. Are there any known bugs with AF_UNIX sockets in 2.0 ? Especially when
many connections are waiting for service from a unix domain socket ? 
Had some mysterious problems with 2.0.33, and couldn't find any changes in
2.0.38. Was thinking maybe some serious problem was discovered and fixed
in 2.2+ :)
