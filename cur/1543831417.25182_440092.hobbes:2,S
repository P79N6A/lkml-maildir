Subject: [BUG sparc64] 2.6.16-git6 broke X11 on Ultra5 with ATI Mach64

In 2.6.17 sparc64 kernels, X11 runs _extremely_ slowly with
frequent lock-up like behaviour on my Ultra5 (ATI Mach64).
I finally managed to trace the cause to this change in 2.6.16-git6:

-	prot = __pgprot(pg_iobits);

 	dir = pgd_offset(mm, from);
 	flush_cache_range(vma, beg, end);
Reverting this patch fixes my X11 problems.
Adding a debug printk and a dump_stack there, plus a hack to
sys_mmap() to store away its parameters, shows:
io_remap_pfn_range: prot 0x8000000000000788, pg_iobits 0x8000000000000f8a, mmap() in 1961(X), prot 0x3, flags 0x1
Call Trace:

I.e., X did a simple PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE MAP_SHARED mmap() of
something PCI-related, presumably the ATI card. The protection
bits passed into io_remap_pfn_range() are 0x80...0788, while
pg_iobits are 0x80...0f8a. Current kernels obey the prot bits,
which, if I read things correctly, means that _PAGE_W_4U and
_PAGE_MODIFIED_4U don't get set any more.
I guess something else in the kernel should have set those
bits before they got to io_remap_pfn_range()?
