It wont of course, the point is to generate a flood of events to put as
much pressure on blktrace logging as possible. Dirtying tons of data
does that.

Pretty pointless, unless you are tracing lots of disks. 4x128kb gone
wont be a showstopper for anyone.

And the counters are special cases and extremely inflexible.
