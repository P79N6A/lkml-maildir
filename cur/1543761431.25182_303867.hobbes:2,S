Maybe... But..., concider ppc system, 
each lock is about 10 instructions(or even less), 
increment with return is about 3-5 instructions, unlock - 
barrier() and setting.
The whole fork syscall contains too bigger number
of instruction(do_fork() itself is more than 500, 
and it is not counting number of instructions in 
functions that are called from do_fork()) 
to care about 20 idle on each CPU, 
even if there are 512 of them.
The most significant part there - is requirement to store
u32 seq in each CPU's cache and thus flush cacheline + 
invalidate/get from mem on each other cpus
each time it is accessed, which is a big price.

It is totally Guillaume's work - so he decides, 
I would recomend per cpu counters and processor's 
id in each message.
And of course userspace should take care of misordered
messages.
I personally prefer such mechanism.
Guillaume?
