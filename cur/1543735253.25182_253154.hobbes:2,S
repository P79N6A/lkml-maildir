Hi!
Do you remember that build issue, where you needed to added ', "aw"'
to make linker happy? Well, too late I found that it breaks swsusp in
quite a ugly way. Try it on x86-64: it works without "aw", breaks with
it.
I'm doing this for now. I'll probably just rewrite assemlby not to
require those variables, but understanding what went wrong there would
be welcome.
#       .section .data.nosave, "aw"
        .section .data.nosave
        .align 8
loop:
        .quad 0
loop2:
        .quad 0
        .previous
