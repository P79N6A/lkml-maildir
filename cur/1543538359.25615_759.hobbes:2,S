Windows 95/98 scandisk 8-)
Their implementation well documented (they need 3 lock levels), but very
slow (scandisk restarts from scratch if someone else writes to the disk)
The filesystem reduces metadata caching, and scandisk uses a special
interface for atomic read-fsck-write cycles. (conditional writes,
similar to the atomic instructions on most RISC cpus)
