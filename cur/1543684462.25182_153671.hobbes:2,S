hi-
i just spent too long barking up the wrong tree, wondering why i
couldn't read DVD+R discs in a read-only drive that look like this in dmesg:
% dmesg | grep hdc                                       ~
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xffa8-0xffaf, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:pio
    hdc: Lite-On LTN486S 48x Max, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
                                        ^^^^^^^^^^
    hdc: attached ide-cdrom driver.
    hdc: ATAPI 48X CD-ROM drive, 120kB Cache, UDMA(33)
why was i having trouble? because this drive does not read DVD-ROMs! now
i know to ignore the second line and pay attention to the last one, but
really, let us fix this ambiguity. "CD/DVD" seems commonly used to refer
to drives which read both formats- let's change this to "optical disc"
or "CD and/or DVD" for clarity. patchette follows.
