Hi all,
I had some free time and decided to port the beowulf channel bonding
patch for linux 2.0.30 to the latest kernel 2.3.0 ... I hope I haven't
duplicated anyone's work, I couldn't find any other version than the
patch for 2.0.30..
I did this because I was wondering if channel bonding might make a
difference in linux' perfomance in the recent 4 cpu + 4 ethernet
"benchmarks" like the ones from mindcraft and zdnet.. 
So if someone feels like verifying if it works, what kind of speeds you
get etc. I can't test it properly unfortunatly, I have 2 computers
linked with a crossover cable, and a 3c509B-TX (100Mbps) and a 3c590
(10Mbps) installed in my linux system.. so i verified that the kernel
doesn't crash.. but that's the most I can test.. until i buy a
switch/hub that is.. 
You can get the patch here:
http://www.glasscity.net/users/gsaraber/gerard/linux.html
I decided not to attach the patch in case no one cares and don't want
this junk in their mailbox, if you don't have web access, feel free to
email me, I'll send you the patch, or upload it someplace public..
I also noticed a typo in linux-2.3.0/net/core/dev.c on line 669 , it
says "rotutines" .. which should obviously be "routines" 
the fix is not included in my patch .. after applying my patch the typo
is on line 671 ... 
PS. This is the very first time I have touched kernel source, please be
gentle :-)
Also please CC any replies to gsaraber@unlimitedsolutions.com.. thank
you..
