what you don't realize is that Intel (and AMD) have built their business 
on makeing sure that their new CPU's run existing software with no 
modifications, (and almost always faster then the old versions). remember 
that for most of the world, getting the software modified would mean 
buying a new version, if the vendor bothered to make a different version 
for the new chip.
if they required everyone to buy new software to use a new chip it 
wouldn't work well. In fact Intel tried to do exactly withat with the 
itanium and it has been a spectacular failure (or t the very least, not a 
spectacular sucess)

in theory they could change anything at any time, in practice if they 
break old software they won't sell the chips, so the modifications tend to 
be along the lines of this one, adding detail to the specifications so 
that programmers can get more performance.
