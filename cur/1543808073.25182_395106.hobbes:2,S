Subject: [patch 00/03] EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL_FUTURE()

Currently we don't have a way to show people that some kernel symbols
will be changed in the future from EXPORT_SYMBOL() to
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL().  As we all know, not everyone reads the
Documentation/feature_removal.txt file, so we need a bigger way to
remind people.
Here's a series of three patches that adds this functionality, and
marks the RCU and USB subsystems with them.
I'll be adding these to my kernel trees to have them show up in the -mm
releases for testing.
thanks,
greg k-h
