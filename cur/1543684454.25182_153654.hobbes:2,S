I don't think I asked the right question :)  If I call usleep(x) or 
nanosleep(x) with kernel 2.4.21, and x < 10, the sleep would still last 
10 ms because of the timeslice.  All sleeps would be a multiple of 10 ms.
If I call usleep(x) or nanosleep(x) in 2.6.0-test2, what 'multiple' can I 
expect?  Maybe I mean granularity instead of timeslice.  Basically, I 
want to know how 'soft' of a real-time system the new kernel is.
It would be great if sleeps were 1ms accurate instead of 10ms.  It would 
make synchronization code a lot easier.
