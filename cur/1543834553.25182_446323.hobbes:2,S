With a mesh graph like that one, you are right.  Rather like my
test cases to see if the  loop-detection algorithm is working.

My use cases were generally about creating links at the twig level.
In my consideration, there would be two or more topical trees arranged
by different criteria, and they would bottom out at the
topics, which are directories that hold a number of documents.
A document might be a single file, a few files together, or a
directory that contains a few files that should alwas be together. I
suppose that an entire source tree could be considered one document,
and there lies the flaw.
This system is an attempt to replace a system of hard links to files
that didn't work because certain MS applications use rename and create
when saving files. The filesystem is intended to be
exported over smbfs. It is still very-much a single-user scheme,
which is why the bad worst case didn't really concern me.

Maybe someday I'll work out a system by which much less is locked.
Conceptually, all that is requred to lock for the algorithm
to work is creating hard-links to directories and renaming directories
cross-directory.

Counterexample? I should swear that any cycle created by rename must
pass through the new parent into the victim and back to the new
parent.
