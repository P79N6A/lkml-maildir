Mmm. SLES11 will ship with CONFIG_SLAB, FWIW. No I actually didn't
make any input into the decision. And I have mixed feelings about
that because there are places where SLAB is better.
But I must say that SLAB seems to be a really good allocator, and
outside of some types of microbenchmarks where it would sometimes
be much slower than SLAB, SLAB was often my main performance competitor
and often very hard to match with SLQB, let alone beat. That's not
to say SLUB wasn't also often the faster of the two, but I was
surprised at how good SLAB is.

Well if you would like to consider SLQB as a fix for SLUB, that's
fine by me ;) Actually I guess it is a valid way to look at the problem:
SLQB solves the OLTP regression, so the only question is "what is the
downside of it?".
