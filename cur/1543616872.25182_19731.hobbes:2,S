there is an important SMP fix in this release, found by Anton Blanchard:
double-spin_unlock()ing triggered oopses on high-end SMP boxes.
stability status: all reported problems were fixed by -H6, the only
problem remaining was Anton's SMP crashes, which should be fixed in this
-H7 patch.
Changes between -H6 and -H7:
- Anton Blanchard: fix double spin_unlock in sched.c. This fixes
  a high-end SMP oops he saw.
- William Lee Irwin III: fix mwave's ->nice code.
- cleanup: mmu_context.h renamed to sched.h, as suggested by
  Richard Henderson.
- added a irqs_enabled() macro to the x86 tree, to simplify irq.c.
Bug reports, comments, suggestions welcome.
