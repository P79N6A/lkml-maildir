Subject: Memory Stick Changes in 2.6.11?

I was pulling some pictures out of memory sticks from a camera, and 
after I pulled tham I was removing the image files from the stick. One 
of the sticks mounted read-only. After a few attempts to explicitly use 
"rw" in the mount command and things like that, I booted back into 
2.6.10 and found the stick mounted rw.
I looked at the code, and I don't see anything obvious. Can someone 
point me to where the change is made?
OT: I think that if I explicitly use the rw option the mount should do 
what I ask or fail. This "I can't do what you want so I did something 
else" behaviour make scripts more complex.
