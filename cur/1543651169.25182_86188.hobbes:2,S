Looking at my menuconfig patch (that's been mailed to lkml numerious
times), the old Menuconfig script and checking mconf.c, it looks like
mconf.c isn't checking for half the errors that the old Menuconfig
script used to / would've been checking with my patch.
Oh, and another thing I've noticed is that mconf does nothing if it
fails to execute lxdialog - it doesn't tell you _why_ it's doing
nothing.  It just says something like "Not saving configuration."
The last mailing of my patch was a while ago, so I'll reproduce it
here:
| This patch fixes a failure case in menuconfig which can occur if a kernel
| tree is configured on one architecture with menuconfig, and then attempted
| to be reconfigured on another architecture.
| 
| The kernel detects that the binary can't be run on the second architecture
| and correctly returns the appropriate error code.  However, the Menuconfig
| script ignores this error and retries endlessly, appearing to hang.
| 
| This patch makes menuconfig display a message and exit rather than
| endlessly looping.
