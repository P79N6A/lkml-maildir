We've looked at the patch a bit and would prefer that it not
be applied as is.  In particular, it seems to remove proper
detection for features that are in the driver today.  For example,
the decisions that are made off the subsytem ID...
Would it be possible to split this into smaller patches that
each do one particular thing?
Regards,
Dan
