	linux-2.4.0-test11-pre5/drivers/net/sunhme.c fails to compile
on x86 because it uses the undefined symbols DMA_BURST{BITS,8,16,32,64},
which are not defined anywhere in include/asm-i386/*.h.  For sparc,
these symbols are defined in include/asm-sparc/dma.h, so I copied them
in sunhme.c and bracketted them if #ifndef DMA_BURSTBITS...#endif, which
made the code compile.  However, that is probably not exactly the cleanest
change (it should give correct behavior, however, since the PCI bus
behavior is just to set the mask in question to all ones, so that the
tests for different DMA types all succeed, if I understand correctly).
