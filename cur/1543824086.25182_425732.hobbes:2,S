Before I build i do:
PATH=/usr/local/modutils/sbin:$PATH
Therefore it must be reading it first, sorry I should have mentioned
this... just have done so much to try and get it to work I can't
remember it all :)
In response to Willy's post, yeah it was by hand, i can't get that comp
on the network yet :(
I will answer all your detailed questions and rebuild the kernel, but it
didn't have any revisions after names, I'll rebuild with that exact
.config i posted after a make clean mrproper to ensure its installing
the new kernel.  Then I'll also try disabling modversion.
Thanks!
George
