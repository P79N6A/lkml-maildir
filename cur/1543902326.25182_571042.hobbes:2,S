Subject: [PATCH][RFC] Delete export of tty.h to userspace.

  given that the entire contents of include/linux/tty.h is contained
within an "#ifdef __KERNEL__", it seems pointless to export it to
userspace, unless there's some kind of need for that header file to
exist in userspace, even if it's empty.
  a quick grep shows that nothing under /usr/include references any
file of the name "tty.h" in any way.  thoughts?
