It makes sense in the first cpuset patch
(cpusets_using_containers.patch), but should be removed in the second
cpuset patch (multiuser_container.patch). In the 2nd patch, we use this
comparison:
	if (task_cs(p) != cs)
		continue;
cont variable introduced in the 1st patch essentially becomes unused
after 2nd patch.
