The function do_try_to_free_pages() also gets called when we're
only short on inactive pages, but we still have TONS of free
memory. In that case, I don't think we'd actually want to steal
free memory from anyone.
Moving it into the same if() conditional the other memory
freeers are in would make sense, though ...
