   Rather I was interested in introducing a scaled math header.  It
   would contain routines to allow access to the 64 bit mpy and div
   instructions, which ,of course, can be done in C but, if you don't 
   want the 64-bit lib, must be done with a rather large bit of code to 
   do simple s32=s64/s32 and s32=s64%s32 calculations.  And, on 64-bit 
   archs the whole problem goes away.
I think you want to do something more like what the byteorder swabbing
interfaces do.  Let the arch override whatever it'd like to optimize,
but provide default 32-bit/64-bit centric "implementations" under
linux/scaled_math/
