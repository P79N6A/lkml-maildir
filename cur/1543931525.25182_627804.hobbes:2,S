yeah, true, but the safest way to ensure no functional changes is to get 
identical object code. In sched-devel.git i include obj comparisons to 
cleanup patches as a self-assurance (and later bughunt helper) to make 
sure a cleanup is really just a cleanup.
also, this patch, at first sight, should result in very similar (perhaps 
even the very same) object code. Not 1.2K larger.
