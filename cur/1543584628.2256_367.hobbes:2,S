Could someone enlighten me as to the purpose of this field in the
dentry struct?  There is no elucidating comment in the header for this
particular field and the name/type only indicate it is pointing to
a list of vfsmounts.  Can a dentry belong to more than one vfsmount?
If I have a 'dentry' and simply want to determine what the absolute
path from root is, in the 'd_path' macro, would I use 'rootmnt' of my
current->fs as the 'vfsmount' as well?
Thanks, in advance...
