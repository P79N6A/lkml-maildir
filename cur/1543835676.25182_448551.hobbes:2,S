Hello Matthias,

We aren't talking about the same issue: I was asking to do it
on-the-fly. Umounting the filesystem, running e2fsck and resize2fs
is something different ;-)

Correct: You can add more inodes to a Solaris UFS on-the-fly if you are
lucky enough to have some free space available.
A colleague of mine happened to create a ~300gb filesystem and started
to migrate Mailboxes (Maildir-style format = many small files (1-3kb))
to the new LUN. At about 70% the filesystem ran out of inodes; Not a
big deal with VxFS because such a problem is fixable within seconds.
What would have happened if he had used UFS? mkfs -G wouldn't work
because he had no additional Diskspace left... *ouch*..

Have you ever seen VxFS or WAFL in action?

ZFS uses 'dnodes'. The dnodes are allocated on demand from your
available space so running out of [di]nodes is impossible.
Great to see that Sun ships a state-of-the-art Filesystem with
Solaris... I think linux should do the same...
