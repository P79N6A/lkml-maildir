Well, it was a memory leak, filling more and more resident memory,
leaving less and less for other uses.  I didn't investigate, but
I'm guessing not cache.

User space thing really: you could add an option to swapoff(8) to loop
retrying (well, I think it would need to fork off a child to do the
sys_swapoff, fork another when that one gets OOM-killed; a bit messy,
I agree).
