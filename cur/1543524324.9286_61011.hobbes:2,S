That system, with 330 capabilities, was more correctly designed.
Our system is broken. We have no safe way to "split" a capability,
so we are stuck with the existing granularity.
Linux capabilities are kernel-only too, while a great deal of
security is handled in daemons and set-uid programs.
We might as well just rip out all this complexity, since it isn't
doing enough to eliminate special UID values. For example, there
isn't a "connect to X server" or "edit /etc/passwd" capability.
