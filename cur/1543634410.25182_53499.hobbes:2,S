We already have the "full" list in cdrom.h (GPCMD_*), so lets just use
that. After all, ATAPI_MODE_SELECT10_CMD _is_ the same as the SCSI
variant (and I think the _CMD post fixing is silly, anyone familiar with
this is going to know what ATAPI_WRITE10 means just fine)
Same for request_sense, that is already generalized in cdrom.h as well.
