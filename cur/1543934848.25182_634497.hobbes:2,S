ip_fast_csum() called from raw_send_hdrinc() from raw_sendmsg() ran through
the page boundary into unmapped page...  Bloody odd, that, seeing that
we have checked iph->ihl * 4U <= length and had done
        err = memcpy_fromiovecend((void *)iph, from, 0, length);
before the
                iph->check = ip_fast_csum((unsigned char *)iph, iph->ihl);
that had triggered that crap..
