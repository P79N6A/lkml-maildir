I saw this on the same hardware on 2.4.21-rc7-ac1, and I've seen a
report of the same on -rc1-ac3, but not on module loading, on accessing
the driver.  The problem doesn't seem to be present when running the non
-acX kernels.
Alan asked whether it was a specific in or out instruction in the
driver, but I don't know how to find out.
