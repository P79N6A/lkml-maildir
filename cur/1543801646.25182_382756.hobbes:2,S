The dicey thing in all of this is that the generic kernels will be used 
for the certification of applications. If the cpu limit is too low then 
applications will simply not be certified for these high processor counts. 
One may encounter problems if the app is then run with a higher processor 
count.

I think it is wrong to count the number of boxes. It is the number of 
users that is of major interest. These small boxes typically have one 
user. The larger boxes have whole communities working with them. The 
number of users of very large systems can potentially go into the 10 
thousands of users per installation.
Moreover these larger boxes significantly impact the technological 
progress of humanity on the planet. These large boxes run hurricane 
simulations, do complex visualization necessary for bio technological 
advances, cosmological simulations, other physic stuff etc etc.
