Hi,
In 2.3.32, RLIM_INFINITY is not longer global the same for all
platforms, but it is architecture depending.
On Alpha, there are no problems, since RLIM_INFINITY is changed
back to the old value.
On Intel, we have a new ugetrlimit syscall, so there are no 
problems, too.
But what is with the other architectures like m68k, ppc, sparc,
sparc64 and others ? There the parameter for the syscall has
changed (unsinged long vs. long), but we don't have a new syscall.
How should we handle here the binary compatibility ? Old 2.2.x
kernel doesn't reject the new RLIM_INFINITY, current 2.2.x kernel
rejects them, because RLIM_INFINITY is here -1, and we check
for this.
What is planed for the future ? Will we add new syscalls for the
other platforms, too ? Or will we change the RLIM_INFINITY value
back to the old value ?
 Thanks,
  Thorsten

Linux is like a Vorlon.  It is incredibly powerful, gives terse,
cryptic answers and has a lot of things going on in the background.
