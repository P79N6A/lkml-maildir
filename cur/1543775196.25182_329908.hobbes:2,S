No, it's just bad programming.  How hard can it be to see which spinlocks are being used 
by your ISR and which ones aren't?  Only the ones that your ISR touches should have 
_irqsave.  It's really quite simple.

So you're saying that you're the kind of programmer who makes more mistakes the longer you 
think about something?????
Using GFP_ATOMIC increases the probability that you won't be able to allocate the memory 
you need, and it also increases the probability that some other module that really needs 
GFP_ATOMIC will also be unable to allocate the memory it needs.  Please tell me, how is 
this considered good programming?
