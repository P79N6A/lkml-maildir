No, you're right. My ideal operating system knows what the user
wants too ;)
Most of the time though, you are right. The quality/desirability of an
implementation will be inversely proportional to the number of knobs
sticking out of it (with bonus points for those that are meaningful to
2 people on the planet).
And yes, I think one knob should be enough for swapping behaviour too.
