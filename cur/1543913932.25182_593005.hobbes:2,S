I tried just 18de5bc4c1f1f1fa5e14f354a7603bd6e9d4e3b6 on top of 2.6.22
(threw away the lguest and xen hunks).  The same problem occurs.  2.6.22 is
OK.
I went back to the original patch which I sent to Linus and it matches
18de5bc4c1f1f1fa5e14f354a7603bd6e9d4e3b6.  So all I can think is that there
must have been something else in the tree which I tested which fixed the
bug which 18de5bc4c1f1f1fa5e14f354a7603bd6e9d4e3b6 introduced.  argh.
Can you think what would cause the symptoms which I described?
