I nearly bought a VAIO -- they're cute -- but it was, well, too small. :-)
Do you have small fingers?

That's _heavier_.  Bigger than a VAIO definitely has its place.  Usually
on my living room table, but the portability is very useful.  Mine is
~3.5 lbs and that is still rather heavy to carry.
Though the cables, external power converter etc. and the soft case that
I carry with it contribute noticably to the weight.
Now if someone would kindly invent a folding screen w/ folding keyboard,
and a nice robust package when it's folded -- that would be perfect.
Small enough to carry, large enough to use.
