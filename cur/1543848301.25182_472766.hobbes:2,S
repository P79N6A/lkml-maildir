I can confirm that rmmod e1000 causes that machine can reboot gracefully.

Up to version 0864 it restarts normally. Any higher version causes hang on
restart if e1000 driver is loaded.
I've tried to report it to Intel but they replied that Linux is unsupported on
this board...
It's not an issue in the Linux kernel. Using various printk I can see that
tripple fault or reset via KBD is issued and followed by hang of the BIOS. 
For i965 chipsets, the BIOS is *a lot* buggy :(
