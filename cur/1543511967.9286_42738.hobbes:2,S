Ah, the devfs Holy War - before people get to heavily involved in what
UNIX should be, because DAMN IT, I KNOW WHAT UNIX SHOULD BE AND I AM
ALWAYS RIGHT rhetoric ... you might consider that other OSes, like IRIX,
have done similar things with their hardware fs (not the same setup as
devfs, but similar in concept to create a tree that just has the devices
that are currently on the system)
this argument is pathetic... a philosophical holy war from a bunch of
voices with strict opnions defining their arguments and not presenting
a clear logical argument for why this is such a horrid design to
introduce in the kernel...
