This issue seems to be funny like that.  When I first recieved this
mobo I too had crashes like you say you are having now.  Doing
practically anything would make it crash, passing noapic and nolapic
on boot solved the problems.  Now, as I said, stable with all ACPI
APIC LAPIC enabled.  I haven't changed any hardware or anything
either, except for now I am using the nvidia ethernet with the
forcedeth driver, but I somehow don't think that has anything to do
with it, maybe it is worth looking into.
