The idea behind limiting the page cache is this
1. Lets say one container fills up the page cache.
2. The other containers will not be able to allocate memory (even
though they are within their limits) without the overhead of having
to flush the page cache and freeing up occupied cache. The kernel
will have to pageout() the dirty pages in the page cache.
Since it is easy to push the page out (as you said), it should be
easy to impose a limit on the page cache usage of a container.

I am not quite sure I understand the question. Could you please rephrase
it and highlight some of the difficulty?
