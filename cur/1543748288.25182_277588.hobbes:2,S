I've only put a small cbq test case and the policer test in there for
now. I'd be happy to integrate your test cases if you send them to me.
I wil add more tests in the next days given time.
Our sysadmin had some cycles and set up a UML capable of booting
any kernel image by script so we can easly test all changes to iproute2
or the kernel on as many branches as we want. I've put in the latest
2.4/2.6 main releases, the latest bk snapshots of both and earlier releases
of both to ensure we keep some backward compatibility. All 2.6 branches
have 2 configs, one with action code and the other with the old policer.
I'm not quite sure which versions of iproute2 are being used by the
distributions so I've put the latest bk version and the ones of red hat,
suse and debian into it.
That's 36 kernel<->iproute2 combinations per test, given we add a few
dozen tests makes it hard to tell if something went wrong. I'll
probably need to add some more logic to it besides just checking if
the test script has written anything to stderr.
I'll be happy to put patches into the test cycle once they're posted
to netdev or alternatively add dave's bk tree to the list of branches
whichever is more reasonable.
