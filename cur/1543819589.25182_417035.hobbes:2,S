You'd not use "tee()" here, because you never have any data that you want 
to go to two different destinations, but yes, you could use very 
well use splice() for this.
(well, technically you have the header part that you want to duplicate, 
and you _could_ use "tee()" for that, but it would be stupid - since you 
want to see the header in user space _anyway_ to see where to forward 
things, you just want to start out with a MSG_PEEK on the incoming socket 
to see the header, and then use splice, to splice it to the destination 
socket).

At that point, you need to actually watch the data in user space, and so 
you need to do a real read() system call.
(Of course, the "kernel buffer" notion does allow for a notion of "kernel 
filters" too, but then you get to shades of STREAMS, and that just scares 
the crap out of me, so..)
