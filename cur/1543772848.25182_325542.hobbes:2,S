Yes

Well, the question is Intel or AMD, i am using AMD-CPUs since six
years, and i was happy with them all the time, and i have to use intel
at work, and i am not happy with the performance of this chip.
So i think i will give the nForce 4 ultra chip a try, maybe via will
release their vt8251 (AHCI capable) southbridge in some month, then i
will have to buy a new board.
Kind Regards
