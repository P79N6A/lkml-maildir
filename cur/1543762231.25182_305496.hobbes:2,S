I originally reported this to the linuxppc64-dev list, since I made it
happen on a POWER system.  I'm told this might be more generic...
Anyone run into something like this?

Subject: ext3 journalling BUG on full filesystem
Hi,
I'm running 2.6.11 and I'm suspecting that a full ext3 filesystem is
causing the following problem when performing some journaling
operation.  Let me know if I can provide more details:
