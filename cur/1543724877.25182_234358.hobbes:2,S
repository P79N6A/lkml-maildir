Hmm, I wonder why we didn't just fail the allocation. Maybe we should
check (gfp_mask & __GFP_NOFAIL) instead of !(gfp_mask & __GFP_NORETRY);
everything else should be allowed to fail, except things loop if
without __GFP_NORETRY, as presumably only __GFP_NOFAIL allocations are
ones that supposedly can't handle failures in-context.
The only difference laptop_mode should have is dirty memory handling,
but you don't have any dirty memory. Maybe swapcache is fooling things.
Most notably, add_to_swap() sets the page dirty...
Something is very wrong here... could you try this?
