As far as I know, UML is the only port which implements exitcalls
for statically linked code.  So this problem won't be observed on
the other architectures.
The problem still *exists*, of course, but isn't too serious.  Maybe a
judicious hack to hide the problem would suffice.  Depends how hard
it is to unmount root during shutdown.
