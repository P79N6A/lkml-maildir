Hm, I thought I made my opinion pretty clear in the beginning.
Why not just do a simple:
	led01
	led02
	led03
	...
and so on?
And use the 'name' field to put the name of your device (disk,
bluetooth, etc.)  This is the way all other busses and devices work, and
I don't think that LEDs are anything more "special" than anything else
in the kernel, right?
So the original patch in this thread is close, but not quite there.
thanks,
