I'm having trouble with my soundcard (s3 sonicvibes). After a view minutes
of playing, the sound stops. Sometimes I can restart the playing,
sometimes I cannot. This happens with x11amp and mxaudio (same binaries
work fine on another system), so I think that this is the fault of the
kernel. 
Sometimes, but not always, I get one of the following messages:
May  8 19:19:39 frodo kernel: sv: write: chip lockup? dmasz 65536 fragsz
8192 count 65536 hwptr 0 swptr 0

When they happen they are usually repeated many times (like 10-200).
I have tried various kernels, last was 2.2.7-ac4.
