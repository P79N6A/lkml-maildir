Sure. I'd always thought it was intentional though.

It is slightly useful: appearance, ease-of-use, etc.
Code is partly for humans to read, and is often written by
humans too. The standard syntax has worthless ugly junk.
The extension doesn't break any valid K&R, C90, or C99 code.
Obviously, considering the kernel source, people _like_ this:
void foo(void){
  if(bar()) goto out;
  baz();
out:
}
If it broke valid C99 code, then sure, it would have to go.
