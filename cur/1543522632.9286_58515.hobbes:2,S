Let me clarify what I mean by "turn off" above... This is that
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward is defaulted to 0 which disables
ipforwarding regardless of the ipchains policy.  That is what I
meant here.  RedHat 6.1 and probably all other dists too default
to not modifying the ipchains rules for default policies, so the
default is in fact ACCEPT if that is what you mean, but
forwarding wont occur due to the default proc entry which
disables ip_forward.  one needs to enable FORWARD_IPV4 in
/etc/sysconfig/network on RedHat, which has the effect of echoing
"1" to the proc file...

No, I didn't mean like that.  I meant that some things people
want to put in the kernel for security's sake, but which do not
really provide any security anyway.  Perhaps that doesn't qualify
as security through obscurity, but I don't think things should go
into the kernel for security's sake unless the provide a true
level of security, and one which can not be equivalated in
userland with existing tools.  That is what I meant to say, but
alas I was not being too clear...

Well, I don't see it as a problem.  One can easily modify kernel
source for the non-general case.  The kernel by nature, has been
coded for the general case mostly...  Nobody wants surprises
here and there...

Right, and I agreed.  Since then I've found out about:
ipchains -i <interface>
Using it, allows you to create firewall rules based on the
interface rather than it's hard coded IP address.  That way the
IP may change, and the rule changes with it without
reconfiguration.  I am rewriting some of my own scripts now to
use it instead of trying to determine the IP.
I still however forsee a few possible problems that may or may
not be easily solveable...  It depends on how complex ones
firewall rules are.

Well, then I misunderstood, and apologize.  I agree with the idea
of possibly doing something like you suggest on isolated systems
that don't fit into the general case.  My intent was to say that
making that policy the default case for the official kernel would
be bad, break many systems initscripts, and generally not be a
good thing to do.

Yes, that was mainly what I was trying to say.  ip_forward though
is effectively DENY allready by default via /proc.  So you are
correct.

Yes, I agreed with that part 100% at first.  Now it is more like
50% after finding the "ipchains -i" option.  There are still some
issues (in my understanding) of how to rewrite ipchains scripts
for PPP/DHCP which can run prior to interface activation.
I would like to work with you (in private) on perhaps solving any
issues either one of us finds with such scripts if you're
interested.  Any rule using the IP number directly, or Network
number, or netmask of the interface could potentially need to be
re-written in a way that doesn't hard-code it.  This may or may
not be possible.  I'm looking into it now...

Oh, I agree with you 100%.  I think that people such as ourselves
however as part of the community need to discuss the issues too.
Often both guru's and non-guru's alike learn something from it.

Well you are correct, but even moreso.  Since the default forward
policy can be ACCEPT as well - forwarding will be denied anyway
due to /proc (see above).  So yes, ipchains would not be required
in this case ase well. (which is the way it is now basically -
default ACCEPT on everything - but forward is denied until
ip_forward=true)..

Right.  There are many convoluted setups out there.  Impossible
to determine what their needs are.  That means things should be
as sane as possible to cover all possible cases in a general and
useful way.  The DHCP/dynPPP problem is a special case, but
perhaps not as bad as both of us originally figured...
Another thought just occured to me, and that is the new
"netfilter" code in 2.3.x.  ipchains is history now, and replaced
by netfilter in 2.3.x.  I wonder how this will effect the various
things we've discussed?  I'm going to check up on netfilter
now...  I'd rather redo my ipchains scripts to netfilter in
anticipation of 2.4 than mess around like I had to from ipfwadm
to ipchains...  ;o)

You have a good point there...  ;o)  For all I know, NASA could
have labs full of machines configured in a way I would call
"rare".  ;o)

Heheh..  Always good to end off with a good pun...  ;o)

I'm glad to see we share a similar sense of humor through this
discussion.  ;o)
Ok..  I think we've got the answers, info, etc.. for this now
from a variety of people.  I also think that we agreed on things
more than we initially realized due to not saying things in a
clarified manner.
So, lets continue via private mail (with the DHCP/PPP config
probs perhaps?) or just kill the thread. I'm going to see if I
can fix my scripts in the dynamic case now...
If you're interested in this, let me know privately and we'll
discuss it.
Take care,
