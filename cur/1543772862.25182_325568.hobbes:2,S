The original idea here was to free up resources for allocation
to other devices.  The ACPI spec claims we should call _DIS
when powering down the device to _D3.  So, I'm considering not
disabling the device when the driver is unbound, especially with
PNPACPI.  I need to think about it more.
Thanks,
