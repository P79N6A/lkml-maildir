There's a new patch, which fixes the race in clear_page_dirty_for_io()
and cleans up the page dirtying logic.  And the mmap mtime/ctime
update patch has seen much improvement.  The others are resends and
fixes.
I'm not resending the fuse writable mmap patches until the fate of the
deadlock fixes is decided.
Thanks
Miklos
