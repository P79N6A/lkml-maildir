As implemented - on any CPU.
We also need to know that the IRQ handler is not doing useful work on
another processor which is why we take the lock after disabling the
interrupt line everywhere. Without that we might be completing an IRQ on
another CPU and that would race the transmit and make a nasty mess.

For MMIO it does look like that may be needed. Looks sensible.
