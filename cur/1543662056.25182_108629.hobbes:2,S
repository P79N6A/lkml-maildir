I strongly believe your problems are related to the I/O APIC,
not the local APIC:
- the local APIC has minimal impact on system-level IRQ handling,
  whereas the impact from the I/O APIC by definition is major
- the 'noapic' option disables the I/O APIC, NOT the local APIC
  (at least in all standard kernels, Debian may have broken this)
- disabling the local APIC kernel option also disables I/O
  APIC on uniprocessor support
