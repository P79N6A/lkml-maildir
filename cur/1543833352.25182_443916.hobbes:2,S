Arjan has an idea that looks nice to me: passing the nesting level via a 
special type that has zero size on non-lockdep. This means that the 
current "nesting + 1" arithmetics has to be turned into something like: 
lockdep_deeper_nesting(var), and that all explicit uses of '0' have to 
become symbolic - the former is acceptable and the later is desirable. 
This could possibly also be used to clean up some of the VFS-internal 
nesting. Hm?
