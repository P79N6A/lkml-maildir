Does 2.6.20.8 boot with acpi=off, does 2.6.21?
Any chance you can get the serial console log of the failure when booted with "debug"?
Also, the 2.6.20.8 dmesg is missing the beginning, try dmesg -s64000 --
though it will probably not be very interesting until 2.6.21 output is available to compare to it.
thanks,
