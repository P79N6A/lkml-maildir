The primary reason NetBSD changed the partition type number is because
many NetBSD/i386 developers like to have both NetBSD and FreeBSD on
the same machine for testing, and having to edit the partition table
to switch from one OS to the other was a pain.  AFAIK no change was
made to the disklabel structure.

If the disk contains NetBSD 1.3.3 or later, it won't be a problem.
