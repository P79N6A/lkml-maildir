Yes, userspace will get confused, if we we don't get proper
notification. We require to update the udev and HAL database with the
new devpath, to find the current device context on device events, or
for "remove".

Udev and HAL, both will need an event for the moving, with the old
DEVPATH value in the environment. We want something like a "rename" or
"move" event. Without that, weird things will happen in userspace,
because the devpath is used as the key to the device during the whole
device lifetime. The only weird exception today is the netif rename
case, which is already handled by special code in udev.
Thanks,
