Subject: [PATCH 45/79] [PATCH] fix apic acking of irqs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Glauber Costa <gcosta@redhat.com>
EOI is a write-only register. Using write around will have the effect
of reading it, which will make all subsequent reads of the ESR register
to return an error code. It was unnotices for quite a while because main sources
of reading the ESR register where done prior to apic interrupt enabling.
