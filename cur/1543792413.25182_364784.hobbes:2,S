* they are 9 users of "old" interface already, one more does not seem
like a big deal.
* arm maintainer does not want anything more complex than "old"
interface. And I can see his point. It is not clear if "new" interface
will get into mainline.
* there are very little users of collie, currently. Changing LED API
on myself does not seem like a big deal. [I'm trying hard to get _two
more_ users :-)]
* if openembedded people do not like current interface, they should a)
convince rmk API needs to change and b) convert all the drivers.

I'd say charger LED is somehow important, and I liked CPU usage LED a lot.
