Subject: dead programs LISTEN sockets remain in netstat (Kernel Version 2.4.18-rc4 SMP)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Quick Summary: Rarely, but several times in the past few weeks now after 
I kill off a process nicely(SIGTERM) its LISTEN sockets remain open...
Some Detail: Because of this, Squid or our server side app cannot 
respawn(cannot bind to socket as it's in use), sometimes its squid's 
socket that remains in the LISTEN state and other times it's been out 
server side app. These are the apps running on our servers which are 
restarted most often. I don't see how an application could be 
responsible for this behaviour after it is dead. So now I look to the 
kernel ;)
My diagnostics below:
lsof -n -P | grep 9000 finds nothing, however netstate shows TCP/9000 in 
listen state w/ no parent program?
