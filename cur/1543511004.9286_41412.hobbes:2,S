I'll say... Just what kind of fs object could it possibly have immediately

Huh? If you mean /proc/<pid>/fd/<fd> - sorry, no. It has its own inode and
all you have there is follow_link(). Which doesn't touch the inode of
socket - just a dget() on the dentry.
Look: there are very few functions that really scan the hash chains. 
That is, iunique() and iget(). Both ignore the inodes with i_sb different
from their argument. Neither is called with sb==NULL, so from their point
of view the socket inodes are ballast. The rest couldn't care less which
chain inode belongs to (some do care whether it belongs to _some_ list,
though). So we have no reason for putting socket and pipe inodes into the
normal hash chains (ones anchored in inode_hashtable).
	All we need to do is to modify insert_inode_hash() so that it
would put inodes with ->i_sb==NULL into separate chain. Callers don't need
to know about that - it's purely inode.c business. The patch follows:

It solves all potential problems with icache pollution. The cost being one
(constant) assignment, one comparison and one (not taken) branch per
insert_inode_hash(). It's less than we spend skipping the inode when we
traverse the chain and it's done once. IMO it's a clear win. I can post
the formal proof of correctness if you need it.
