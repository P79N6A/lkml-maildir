nitpick, please don't add an indentaion level for the do {.  Do this
should look like:
	#define macrofun(a, b, c) 	\
	do {				\
		if (a == 5)		\
			do_this(b, c);	\
	} while (0)

I'd rather document to not use this - it makes the code far less
redable.  And it's a non-standard extension, something we only
use if it provides us a benefit which it doesn't here.
