Great.  Thanks for the help.  I'm using Debian Woody, so my init is a bit
different.
I copied /etc/init.d/skeleton to /etc/init.d/devfs, edited it
apropriatley, ln -s /etc/init.d/devfs /etc/rcS.d/00devfs, and rebooted.
It works well, I think.  
I didn't have a chance to actually test it out much because 2.3.46
produces an oops when I insmod my joystick (Im pretty sure this is
reported already) and also says that my AWE64 cannot be found (reported
already too).  So I'm sticking with 2.3.42 for now because that's what
works.  
Thanks for the help.
