Ok, the kernel that I now have booting is 2.6.17-rc5-mm2 + my
pata_pdc2027x patch + the 3 hotfixes that I saw when I started trying
to build the kernel (i.e. without git-scsi-target-fixup but with the
other 3 that are now present).
During boot of my Debian sarge system, this kernel always gives this
warning at "Starting MTA:"

Then, a minute or two after boot, it usually (well over 50% of the
time, but not quite 100%) gives this oops:

If it doesn't fail with that oops, it usually tends to fail with other
oopses (I have not managed to capture any of those, but they all seem
to mention network-related stuff). Once, it just froze up without an
oops. The oops I posted happens often enough that it's probably
unjustifiably difficult to try reproducing the other oopses until this
one is fixed or worked around.
I plan to try 2.6.17-rc5-mm1 + mingo's latest lockdep patch for that
kernel + a properly fixed-up pata_pdc2027x, to see whether that kernel
fails the same way; I've built it but I won't have a chance to test it
for another 3-6 hours.
