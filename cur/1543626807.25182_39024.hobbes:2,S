Nice cleanup.  Awful lot of [items] in the subject though :)
You don't have to worry about your choices wrt set_current_state vs
__set_current_state - by using only set_current_state you erred on the
side of caution.  set_current_state enforces a memory barrier around the
write on SMP (on UP it is the same code) while __set_current_state does
not.
If anyone can verify where it is safe in this code to use
__set_current_state instead, speak up so Paul can make the micro
optimization accordingly.
