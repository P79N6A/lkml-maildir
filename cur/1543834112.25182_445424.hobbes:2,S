It doesn't match any of those awful regex strings when
looking for function prototypes, so kernel-doc (the script)
coughs and dies, as noted in DocBook/kernel-api.tmpl
for drivers/pci/search.c.

Yes, in theory at least (for __init and __exit, not __initdata,
since this is in function definitios).
I just haven't run into the need for those yet.
