Could you also check map_user_kiobuf()?
map_user_kiobuf() calls flush_dcache_page() - if I understand
cachetlb.txt correctly that function is only suitable for dcache/mmap
cache coherency, it's not suitable for anon pages. But map_user_kiobuf()
must support arbitrary pages.
And unmap_kiobuf doesn't contain a single cache flush.
