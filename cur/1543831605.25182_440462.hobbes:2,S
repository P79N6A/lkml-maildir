The timestamp optimizations are older. Don't remember the exact release,
but earlier 2.6.

Not sure what you mean here?
2.6.18 will likely be more aggressive at using the TSC on i386 on
Intel systems where possible, but x86-64 did this already for a long time. 
When x86-64 uses non TSC then it's because using the TSC is not safe.
