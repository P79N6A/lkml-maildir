Hi Samuel,
I am not sure about loop devices but for uinput there is most likely a
daemon that needs to be started so I would just load the module
(modprobe uinput) right from the same script that starts the daemon.
You do not need to check if module has already been loaded, just try
loading it unconditionally and use /dev/input/uinput.
