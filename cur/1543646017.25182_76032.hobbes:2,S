Where's the problem with md5sum? If the rules are usually not visible
anyway, why do we use the _shipped postfix at all? The depencies are
hidden this way as well, so make won't even try to regenerate the file.
The developer has to remember that extra argument to get the file
regenerated, what is IMO more hacky than using md5sum.
bye, Roman
