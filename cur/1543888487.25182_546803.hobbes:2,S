Uhm, then why are you trying to use them to compare against Bill's
numbers? You two have completely different hardware setups, and this
is a test that is dependent upon hardware. Stated differently, this is
a worthless comparison between your results and his as you are
changing multiple variables at the same time. (At minimum: the
scheduler, cpu, and video card.)

It doesn't look like you were running his glitch1 script which starts
several in glxgears parallel. Were you, or were you just running one?
