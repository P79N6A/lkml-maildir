Subject: [patch] disk read latency update
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Updates the elevator changes to sync with the version
which is in the latest -rmap patch.
This may complicate future merging with Rik; the easiest
approach will be to just drop any ll_rw_blk.c and elevator.c
chunks when merging up -rmap.
The changes here are:
- More aggressive merging algorithm: continue to add new
  sectors to existing requests even if later requests have
  expired.  We now only refuse to promote new sectors over
  expired ones if the new sector would create a new
  request.
  In other words, latency expiration in the request queue
  no longer means "don't move sectors past this point".  It
  now means "don't create new requests past this point".
  The assumption here is that expanding an existing request
  is basically free.
  Worth about 10% on dbench, and we know how important that is.
- Increase the number of requests to (up to) 1024.
  We really need to do this, and we can afford to, with the
  read latency changes.
  Worth another 10% on dbench.
