Hi James,
  I'm glad to see that fbdev changes finally arrived, so I can look at them
without using your patches ;-) If you have some changes to matroxfb besides
ones which are in the tree, please send me them... because of I really
need matroxfb running on my machine, I'll make it top priority, just below
my "real" work.
                                                    Best regards,
