Can you elaborate on this? An application would have to have quite a
contrived design if its pointers simply cannot be updated according
to what the kernel returns.
Then again, I'm not sure why wouldn't readv() actually be
zerocopy-ready. Just make sure you handle iov_base being NULL gracefully
now (EINVAL, with the remark that the kernel can write to the iovec
memory area in the future) and later the kernel can in that case set
iov_base to the buffer location?
