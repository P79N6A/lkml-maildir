Subject: Lance driver doesn't work for AT1500

I have an AT1500 NIC that I use under Linux with the lance driver.  However, I 
could not get this driver to work with my card under Linux 2.0.35/36 and 2.2.0 
without modifications. 
First of all, the card uses the address 0x240, which is not supported by the 
driver.  I had to add 0x240 to the list of probed IO ports in the source code. 
 Specifying io=0x240 when loading the module would not make a difference 
without changing the source. 
Second, once the card is recognized successfully, the card seems to "shut 
down" the Ethernet port when initialized.  Linux doesn't notice anything 
wrong, but the LEDS on both my hub and NIC indicating the connection between 
the two are turned off (they were initially on when booting my computer) and 
the card won't send or receive any data.  I solved this problem by commenting 
out two lines of code. 
The patch that will solve these two problems is attached below.  Perhaps some 
of it could be included in the future kernel releases. 
Best regards, 
Alex Adriaanse

 Most ISA boards have jumpered settings for the I/O base, IRQ line, and DMA 
 channel.  This driver probes the likely base addresses:

 After the board is found it generates a DMA-timeout interrupt and uses 
 autoIRQ to find the IRQ line.  The DMA channel can be set with the low bits 
 of the otherwise-unused dev->mem_start value (aka PARAM1).  If unset it is
