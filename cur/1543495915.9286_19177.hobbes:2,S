Yup, already fixed.

My reasoning is as follows:
 - Ctrl-Alt-Del has become almost synonymous for "reboot"
 - Ctrl and Alt are likely to be active at the same time, possibly also
   as the result of a typo (PDAs: keys are heavily overloaded, so you
   end up using Alt/AltGr/etc. almost as frequently as Shift.)
 - usually, when realizing that one has made a a typo, the reflex is to
   hit Del (or maybe Esc)
I also thought about adding a boot_it_unshifted, with its own code, but
dismissed it as too crufty.

Actually, as far as PDAs are concerned, it may also be acceptable simply
not to have a keystroke for reboot at all. You can always use SysRq to
get out of real trouble. (But that's another patch ;-)
Okay, so let's drop this line. New patch attached.
