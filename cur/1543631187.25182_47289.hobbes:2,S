Thanks for the information.
So, I'm just getting used to the idea of using new tools to build kernels, and
now I learn that 2.5 breaks an ordinary program that I use all day, every day.
It just keeps getting better and better...

   Under 2.5.17 there is a problem with gtop 1.0.9.
The /proc/meminfo output changed, and this makes a lot of programs
reading that file explode.
