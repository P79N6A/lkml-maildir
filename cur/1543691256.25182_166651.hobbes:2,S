Wrong list. However, the interface to the network through the
kernel is __NR_socketcall (function 102).
You need to learn how to use `find`, `grep` and other Unix
tools to search large directory trees like glibc.
For instance, in glibc-2.3.1, a lot of utility functions
are in glibc-2.3.1/inet and a lot of socket interface code
is in glibc-2.3.1/unix/sysv/linux/i386/socket.S
