stgt is not scst. It is new. And yes we will have proper support for 
sccatterlists. We need something similar to what sg and st need so I 
plan on using the block layer functions that are implemented for those 
upper layer drivers for stgt. If you want to help out and implement that 
then that would be good. We are also very early in our design so all 
comments are welcome.
