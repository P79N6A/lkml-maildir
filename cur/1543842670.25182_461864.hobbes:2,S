it seems to be a growing virus with network drivers too. bnx2, s2io, tg3 and 
bcm43xx (which has like 40 of them) are already resorting to it. We're even 
planning on putting one in to e1000.
I'm not sure what bcm43xx chip will work with IA64, or if people actually have 
itanium laptops(!) or MIPS, but for e1000 it definately fixes ordering problems 
on IA64.
