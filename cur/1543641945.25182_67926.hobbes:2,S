do you expect a task that uses up 50% CPU time over an extended period of
time to be rated 'interactive'?
we might make the '50%' rule to be '100% / nr_running_avg', so that if
your task is the only one in the system then it gets rated interactive -
but i suspect it will still be rated a CPU hog if it keeps trying to use
up 50% of CPU time even during busier periods. I have tried the
(1/nr_running) rule in earlier incarnations of the scheduler, and it didnt
make much difference, but we obviously need a boundary case like yours to
see the differences.

(it could in theory make a difference in some rare cases, in which the
frequency of sampling resonates with internal timings of the application -
i asked for this only to make sure there are no interactions.)
