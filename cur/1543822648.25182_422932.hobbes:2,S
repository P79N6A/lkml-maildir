That seems a bit hacky, really.  It'd be better to use
try_to_release_page().  It keeps stuff in one place, and what happens if
the filesystem decided to not implement ->releasepage() because it knows
that try_to_release_page() will default to try_to_free_buffers()?
The above code is identical to the below code, so a new helper function
would be appropriate.

aaaarrrghhh.  David, _why_ do you insist on junk like this when you know
what the coding style is and you've repeatedly been asked to follow it?  I
mean, how hard is it?  How many similar uglies are hiding in this patchset?
(greps.  53 of them).  Ho hum.
I think the above will be called against an unlocked page, in which case
the ->releasepage() implementation might choose to go BUG, or something.
I suppose locking the page here will suffice.
But it all seems a bit abusive of what ->releasepage() is supposed to do.
add_to_page_cache() won't set PagePrivate() anyway, so what point is there
in the first hunk?
For the second hunk, is it not possible to do this cleanup in the callback
function?
If read_cache_pages() needs this treatment, shouldn't we also do it in
read_pages()?  And in mpage_readpages()?
Again, as this appears to be some special treatment for cachefs wouldn't it
be better to keep this special handling within cachefs?
