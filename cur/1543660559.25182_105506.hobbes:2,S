An alternate approach might be to change the way the scheduler splits
things. That is, rather than marking I/O read vs write and scheduling
based on that, add a flag bit to mark them all sync vs async since
that's the distinction we actually care about. The normal paths can
all do read+sync and write+async, but you can now do things like
marking your truncate writes sync and readahead async.
And dependent/nondependent or stalling/nonstalling might be a clearer
terminology.
