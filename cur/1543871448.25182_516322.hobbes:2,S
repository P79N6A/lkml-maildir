Any VMAs that can be shared are, as a general rule.  It works this way because
shared MAP_PRIVATE read-only file data (such as a segment of an ELF
executable) is stored in a kmalloc()'d buffer attached to the VMA.  The
lifetime of this buffer is handled by the VMA, and the buffer is not part of
the pagecache.
Maybe it could be; that'd make the ramfs handling more consistent with normal
file handling.
Such things as mappable chardevs do get separate VMA's, but those don't own
the backing store.  That's configured through the BDI information in the
address_space.

Good.  I was hoping someone else would review it.

*shrug*  I was trying to keep the VMA as little changed as possible and add as
little extra to it as possible.

Anyone that squeamish should avoid the full MMU VM like the plague then - it's
way way worse.  NOMMU is considerably simpler.  Yes, some liberties have to be
taken, but there's no avoiding that as there's no MMU available.  I've tried to
take as few as possible, and I've managed to make sure almost all the
functionality afforded by the MMU kernels is available.

*shrug* as you wish.
