That was what I was trying to say: same FSB speed * different multipliers
= different CPU MHZ, like what the original poster is asking about.
I don't think it is possible to configure a motherboard to have different
FSB speeds for two processors.

Hmm, maybe if you had actually read my email and followed the URL I
posted, you would have found the patch to which you refer ;-).
