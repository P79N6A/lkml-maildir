I think this paints with too broad a brushstroke...
Simply limiting the page cache with no regard to the potential
for particular content to be later reused seems a rather
pointless exercise which is guaranteed to diminish system
performance.
It would be far more useful if an application could hint to the
pagecache as to which files are and which files as not worth
caching, especially when the application knows a priori that data
from a particular file will or will not ever be reused.
