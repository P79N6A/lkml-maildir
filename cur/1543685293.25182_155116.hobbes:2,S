Thanks for the detailed explanation. I am still trying to verify what
happens in 2.4.20. Unfortunately, in upgrading/installing the graphics
drivers to enable me to run 2.4.21, I am now unable to run X under 2.4.20.
I have a different graphics card on order.
Simple text printing (/etc/group, print size 1024 bytes) works under both
2.4.20 and 2.4.21, as does tiger.ps (print size ~31k), so I think it
unlikely that a cable problem is to blame, but I can't yet easily test a
large, complicated rendered graphic print on 2.4.20.
However, several reboots later, the original page is printing under
2.4.21, so I don't know now if there's a problem or not.
