Any news on that, Stelian ?
I guess Ben's mega patch (and yes, I also consider it a megapatch for
-rc) has to be applied. I just mailed him asking about the possibility
of getting only fixes in and not the cleanups, but I guess that might be a
bit hard to do _today_. Right Ben ?
And about the sweet complaints about -pre timing, I will release -pre's
each damn week for .22.
