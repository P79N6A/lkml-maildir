The real issue is that the Linux kernel support for -scanbus looks
different than your blueprints. Looks as though the most promising
approach is to tell libscg about it, as annoying though it may be.

CD/DVD writers wtih SCSI interface have nearly died out.

That's what I believe to be cdrecord/libscg bugs:
1) libscg or cdrecord does not automatically probe all available
   transports, but only SCSI:
2) libscg or cdrecord aborts ATA: scans as soon as one device probe
   returns EPERM, which lets devices that resmgr made accessible
   disappear from the list.
