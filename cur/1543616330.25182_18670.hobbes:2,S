Reserving it is fine ;-)  Using it isn't a good idea until the progs
understand it.  Our policy should be to never require a progs update in a
stable kernel series (just like most stable parts of the kernel).
But, the progs are improving so quickly that we should bend this rule a
little bit.  Another example is the unlink truncate patch never should have
been sent to Marcelo without a non-beta reiserfsprogs that understood it.
Neither should this patch (even though it is a much smaller problem).
