Decrease your hardware setup in 2-4 times, leave only one apache process 
and try to get the same - we are not talking about how to create a
perfect web server, instead we try to focus possible problems in
epoll/kevent event driven logic.
Vanilla (epoll) lighttpd shows 4000-5000 requests per second in my setup (no logs).
Default mpm-apache2 with bunch of threads - about 8k req/s.
Default thttpd (disabled logging) - about 2k req/s
Btw, all your tests are network bound, try to decrease 
html page size to get actual event processing speed out of that machines.
