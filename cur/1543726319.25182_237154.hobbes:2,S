Hi,
I have got a new dual-Opteron server based on Tyan S2880 motherboard with
LSI53C1030 U320 controller onboard - there are 15kRPM Fujitsu disks.
I've noticed poor performance with MySQL/InnoDB when compared to another
S2880-based box with IDE disks.
I've tracked it to this:
Let's have this code (notice the O_SYNC) and enough large test file.
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main(int argc, void **argv)
{
  char buffer[64];
  int fd, i;
  fd=open(argv[1], O_WRONLY|O_SYNC);
  
  lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_SET);
  for(i=0; i<10000; i++)
    write(fd, buffer, 64);
  
  return 0;
}
The results are:
LSI53C1030:
$ time ./a.out testfile 
real    0m4.218s
user    0m0.002s
sys     0m0.219s
IDE:
$ time ./a.out testfile 
real    0m1.767s
user    0m0.002s
sys     0m0.356s
Changing size of written amount of data to 4096 the time ratio between
LSI53C1030 and IDE is around 1:1.
Both boxes are running vanilla 2.6.7 kernel.
Any help appreciated,
Jan
