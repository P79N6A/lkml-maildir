Remember that this problem applies to both inode blocks and to directory
blocks.  Yes, it might be useful to hold onto an inode block for a future
write (atime, mtime, usually), but not a directory block.

Yes, the sudden burst of accesses for adjacent inode/dirents will be a
common pattern, and it'd make heaps of sense to treat that as a single
touch.  It'd have to be done in the fs I guess, and it might be a bit hard
to do.  And it turns out that embedding the touch_buffer() all the way down
in __find_get_block() was convenient, but it's going to be tricky to
change.
For now I'm fairly inclined to just nuke the touch_buffer() on the read side
and maybe add one on the modification codepaths and see what happens.
As always, testing is the problem.

I suspect that the situation we have now is so bad that pretty much
anything we do will be an improvement.  I've always wondered "ytf is there
so much blockdev pagecache?"

More that a quarter of my RAM in fs metadata!  Most of it I'll bet is on the
active list.  And the fs on which I do most of the work is mounted
noatime..
