Some motherboards have ram requirements that might not be obvious
without reading the m/b manual. For example, some m/b's require
registered memory. Some don't work with ECC. Some require modules be
installed in pairs (of exact type match). Some require that larger
memory sticks be placed in earlier slots relative to smaller modules.
And if you add a wait state in the bios a marginal ram module can become
quite stable; the unstable version can behave differently under
different circumstances (including temperature). Check the m/b manual
and m/b web site for exact requirements, and make sure the ram matches;
even if your memory is good, it might not be good in your circumstances.
