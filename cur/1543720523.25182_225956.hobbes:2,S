  I also did not get that. And feel a little
  bit obliged to apologize if my hardware is
  older than >2 years ;-)
  That's how it is when live at the
  cutting bleeding edge.
  But I also think that more and more
  hardware functions (aka network, nd
  f***ing WinModem (arrg) moves onto
  the motherboards of the laptops)
  Not to mention WLAN etc ...
  So the support for PCMCIA will slowly
  dissolve....
  Cheers
