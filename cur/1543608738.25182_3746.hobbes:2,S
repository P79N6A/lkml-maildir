The patch may appear to work, but it fails to understand the nature of
the problem. The problem with NFSERR_JUKEBOX is that is can appear in
more or less *any* NFSv3 RPC call. That includes everything from
lookups to writes.
If all you do is intercept read and setattr, then you certainly
haven't achieved 'enterprise quality'.
