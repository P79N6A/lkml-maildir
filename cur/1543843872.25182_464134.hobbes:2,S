Hmmm... that's a good point.  I think you're right on this account, and so the
comments in:
		case 0: /*SEEK_SET*/
			break;
		case 1: /*SEEK_CUR*/
			bf->l_start += offset;
			break;
		case 2: /*SEEK_END*/
			bf->l_start += ip->i_d.di_size;
			break;
should be stripped off as they are not exactly correct.
