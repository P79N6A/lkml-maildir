It seems to be 100% reproducible in arbitrary configuration.
Here's a dmesg snippet from another machine:
Suspending device usbdev4.1
Suspending device usbdev4.1_ep81
Suspending device 4-0:1.0
Suspending device usbdev4.1_ep00
Suspending device usb4
hub 4-0:1.0: activate --> -108
suspend_device(): usb_suspend+0x0/0x30() returns -16
Could not suspend device usb4: error -16
PM: Image restored successfully.
Restarting tasks ... <3>hub 4-0:1.0: hub_port_status failed (err = -108)
hub 4-0:1.0: hub_port_status failed (err = -108)
hub 4-0:1.0: hub_port_status failed (err = -108)
done.
