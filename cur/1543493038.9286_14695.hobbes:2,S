Subject: 2.2.5 optimizations for web benchmarks?

Hello,
I'd like some help with optimizing linux (and apache) 
for a web benchmark. I understand many of the tunables 
in /proc/sys, but I'm not sure if I'm missing something 
crucial.
Assuming fast hardware, with lots of RAM (ranging from 
512MB - 2GB), and with/without RAID (software), and a 
fast network (yellowfin or eepro100), and ext2fs. 
During 2.2.5 Compilation:
What should I change at 2.2.5 compile time? I'm 
especially curious if increasing the initial tcp cwnd 
to min (4380, 4*MSS) as suggested by IETF/tcpimpl would 
make a difference in faster ramp-up for broken clients, 
as well as with the lot's of short lived http1.0 
connections of the benchmark (I presume I'd have to 
change both snd_cwnd and snd_cwnd_cnt)
Will I get any benefit from changing the tunables in eepro100.c and
yellowfin.c ?
During Run time:
I'm looking mainly at /proc/sys/vm and /proc/sys/fs/ 
(besides /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range)
Does anyone have any empirical ideas about 
_specific_ values that would work well for:
inode-max
bdflush
buffermem
freepages
kswapd
pagecache
Any other I'm missing ?
On the application:
I'm using many of the common apache 1.4.3 
optimizations. Is there anything I can do to improve 
SMP performance, to help the built in affinity-scheme 
of linux?
The benchmark itself is specweb96, so the files are 
distributed over a large range of sizes. I expect to 
see 10K-20K simultaneous active connections.
Thanks for any comments !
