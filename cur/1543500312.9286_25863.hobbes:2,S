Howdy,Janos
Our platform is mips-r3k,we want no extra boot loader(linux-kernel is booted from rom)
However,The normal initrd is loaded by loadlin or lilo
Is it possible to port initrd-loader of loadlin/lilo to mips-r3k?
Or is there somebody already done that?
This is very urgent!
Thx in advanced!:)

Check the documentation on the initrd (initial ramdisk) feature, it
allows a filesystem to be mounted at boot time, just before mounting the
'real' root, and do what you want with it.  (One place to find this is
the kernel: .../Documentation/initrd.txt)
Furthermore, you'll need to consult the documentation of your bootloader
(lilo, loadlin, syslinux, etc), to learn how it allows to specify this
"initrd" image.
Any more questions?
