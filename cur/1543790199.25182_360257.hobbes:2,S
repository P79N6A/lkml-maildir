yes, the patch worked.  The general discussion was that the byte counter 
gets incremented when requests are queued, not when they're acted upon 
as is the case with the count of I/Os.  As a result, the disk write 
numbers don't make any sense reporting impossibly high numbers (>100MB 
and as high as 450!) during some times and at other reporting zeros.  
The entire time, the I/O counts are happily showing what appear to be 
correct numbers.  Here's a snapshot taken during a portion of a 2GB file 
file to /tmp.
