        Do you have a test case that demonstrates this? It appears to
me that an MLDv2 general query doesn't execute that code (short circuited
above) and an MLDv1 general query (what that code is handling) will
have a timer expiring before switching back to MLDv2 mode (so it'll send
a v1 report, without any sources). Unless I'm missing something, I can't
see any way for the scenario you've described to happen.
        That said, I also can't see anything it would hurt, so I don't 
object,
but it looks unnecessary to me.
