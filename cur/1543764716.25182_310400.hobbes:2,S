But from a git perspective it will be very efficient.  Imagine that
Linus decides to rename arch/i386 as arch/x86 ... at the git repository
level this just requires a changeset, a new top level tree, and a new
tree for the arch directory showing that i386 changed to x86.  That's
all ... every files below that didn't change, so the blobs for the files
are all the same.
