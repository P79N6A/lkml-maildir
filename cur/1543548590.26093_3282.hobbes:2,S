On one machine, I have applied ide-2.2.17.all.20000904.patch
just to get the core effect of CONFIG_IDEDISK_MULTI_MODE=y
in drivers/block/ide-disk.c.
I can't use any of the specific ide drivers, but it is very
good to be free of hda lost interrupt followed by system
death. Record uptime for that machine in 2.2.x is about 40
hours.
Andre, I'd be glad to extract that portion if there is a
chance it will be accepted.
Tom
