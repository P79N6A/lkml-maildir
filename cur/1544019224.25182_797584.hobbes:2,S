We already run the headers through unifdef, so this should be trivial to 
add.
The intent of headers_check is to try to catch people who put things 
that depend on CONFIG_* stuff in exported headers (which, as we have 
seen, have been too sadly common.)  If we declare that the export 
process will treat all CONFIG_* as undefined, we do lose some coverage 
but potentially end up with cleaner code.  Not sure which is worse...
