i tested only suse kernels recently.  will try mm kernel later, again.
ok, let me explain some nasty points i found through the disk i/o load
tests:
- in the loop in do_journal_end().  this happens periodically in
  pdflush.
  /* first data block is j_start + 1, so add one to cur_write_start wherever you use it */
  cur_write_start = SB_JOURNAL(p_s_sb)->j_start ;
  cn = SB_JOURNAL(p_s_sb)->j_first ;
  jindex = 1 ; /* start at one so we don't get the desc again */
  while(cn) {
    clear_bit(BH_JNew, &(cn->bh->b_state)) ;
    ....
    next = cn->next ;
    free_cnode(p_s_sb, cn) ;
    cn = next ;
  }
- in write_ordered_buffers().
  i still don't figure out where.  we have already cond_resched()
  check in the loops.  this one is triggered when i write bulk data
  in parallel (1GB write with 20 threads at the same time), resulting
  in up to 2ms.
  a typical stacktracing looks like this:
	T=36.569 diff=3.64275
	  comm=reiserfs/0
	  rtc_interrupt (+cd/e0)
	  handle_IRQ_event (+2f/60)
	  do_IRQ (+76/170)
	  common_interrupt (+18/20)
	  kfree (+36/50)
	  reiserfs_free_jh (+34/60)
	  write_ordered_buffers (+11f/1d0)
	  flush_commit_list (+3e6/480)
	  flush_async_commits (+5d/70)
	  worker_thread (+164/1d0)
	  flush_async_commits (+0/70)

	  worker_thread (+0/1d0)
