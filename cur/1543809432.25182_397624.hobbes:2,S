AFAICT, no one at SGI uses or plans to use CONFIG_PREEMPT. Most of
our customers use kernels from one of the distros & none at this point
enables preemption. 
The realtime folks here have experimented with CONFIG_PREEMPT but so
far have not seen any significant benefit.
Regardless, we should fix udelay() to handle unsync'ed ITCs.  It would
be nice to have it working.
