gzip should have no problem opening a file >2GB if you use stdout for your
output.  This is an internal problem with gzip, it has nothing to do with
the filesystem, but the way gzip stores the length of the file.  gzip gives
errors on 64bit systems when the extracted file is >2GB, thus you have to
extract it to stdout.  read and write operations do not care how big the
file is. The problem is seeking, with 32bit pointers you can seek to
positions <2GB, but you would still be able to cat together file that end up
being >2GB.
