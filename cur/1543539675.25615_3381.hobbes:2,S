No, I'm using regular PPP. Doesn't that have an IP-up script? Anyhow,
I'm using "sleep 60;<do stuff> " instead of the IP-up script. Call me

aren't connections at all.

If they really should be dropped on the interface going down, then
I've found a problem (i.e. docs do not conform with practise).

OK. So when my PPP interface goes down, my masq entries aren't dropped!
