Subject: where are the 2.2.x kernel debug patches?

Where can I find the kernel debug patches for the 2.2.x kernels?  I'm using 
2.2.14, 2.2.16, 2.2.20, 2.2.23, and will shortly be looking into 2.2.24rc4.
I have found the following:
http://kgdb.sourceforge.net/
...but the download page only lists 2.4.x kernels.  Are the older 2.2.x patches 
archived anywhere?
Thanks,
