On the v850, there are, to my knowledge, no usable exceptions (the only such
thing is illegal insn, which shouldn't occur, I think).
The latest patches I already sent to Linus handle this by just making
search_extable an inline in asm/module.h:
   /* We don't do exception tables.  */
   struct exception_table_entry;
   static inline const struct exception_table_entry *
   search_extable(const struct exception_table_entry *first,
		  const struct exception_table_entry *last,
	          unsigned long value)
   {
	   return 0;
   }
This allows gcc to remove a bit of the generic exception-table code, but I
was sort of hoping to have something like CONFIG_EXTABLES to get rid of the
rest of it (or maybe CONFIG_INHIBIT_EXTABLES since most archs want them).
As greg showed, this is simple to do, though I suppose the resulting savings
isn't much, and there are many many other places which might more profitably
be pruned...
[OTOH, little bits do add up, and for some reason this particular bit of code
seems extra gratuitous since it was previously arch-specific and I didn't
have to worry about it]
