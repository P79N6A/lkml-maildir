How did you get that value? At any HZ the ratio should be around 1:10
(+- rounding error).

Especially the user levels are doing something completely different now, 
which may break user expectation. While the user couldn't expect anything 
precise, it's still a big difference whether a process at nice 5 gets 75% 
of the time or only 30%.
