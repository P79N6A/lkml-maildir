No, this isn't true.
People complained that we immediatly abandonded the last stable kernel
when a new one came out, so we said we would take patches for a bit on
the last series if people wanted to send them.
That's all, it's not some confusing thing, and we are very much not
going to accept patches for "any" kernel release.
So no, I'm not going to accept this.
thanks,
