i am not able to read movie dvd's anymore under 2.6.19-rc1. i get the
following in the syslog:
  kernel: hdc: read_intr: Drive wants to transfer data the wrong way!
the drive in question is on a thinkpad t40:
  kernel: hdc: UJDA745 DVD/CDRW, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
  kernel: hdc: ATAPI 24X DVD-ROM CD-R/RW drive, 2048kB Cache, UDMA(33)
i can read the disks under 2.6.18 so it's probably not the drive's
fault. any ideas?
