This is really a matter of preference. The generated code ends up being 
about the same, I think, while your patch makes the call to 
nbd_find_request kind of obtuse. Also, the memcpy's are balanced between 
send_req and find_request, so you can quickly see how the data is being 
transferred (from req into handle, and then back again). Your patch 
makes this less clear, at least to me.
