thanks for the pointers !
in general, would it make sense to explicitly
distinguish between mutex semaphores and others (maybe
for producer consumer queues), i.e. have a separate
structure mutex_semaphore with its own up() and down()
 -- this will probably facilitate more fine grained
handling of such priority inversion problems since one
can accurately track the number of mutexes, if any,
that a process is holding at any given point ?
