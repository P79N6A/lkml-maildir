Can you make this a little more transparent?  Having a magic bitmask does
not seem like the best way to do stuff.  Could you maybe make a core_flags
directory with a seperate file for each flag.  It could still map to a
single field in the mm, but be broken out for the proc filesystem.
I can certainly see the value of this for our customers.  We have some
customers that run jobs in the 1-2TB range.  Most of those customers
have always had coredumps disabled and just rely upon being able to
rerun the application and have MPI drop them into a debugger.
Thanks,
Robin
