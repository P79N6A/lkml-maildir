Well, I've gathered a quite decent list of KOREAN [1] advertisement agencies
and/or shops of all kinds in my GMX spam blocking list I could mail to the
list maintainers (not openly!) if need be.
Andreas
[1] sorry for all the Korean people participating in this list, but it's a
fact that 90% of ALL spam I get a day is from Korean origin. Some could be
whois'ed as open relays of Korean elementary schools. And this doesn't and
doesn't get better, rather even _worse_ with every day that passes *sigh*
