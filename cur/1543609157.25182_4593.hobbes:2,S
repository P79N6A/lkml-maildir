  Hi, all. I tried to use my IDE CD-ROM today, the first time in a
long while. When attempting to mount it, the machine locked up,
hard. Even SysReq didn't work. I got the following message:
hdb: timeout waiting for DMA
ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_timeout func only: 14
I was running 2.4.7 initially, and then pulled down 2.4.14 and got the
same problem. All my IDE drivers are loadable modules. The kernel
messages I get when I load those modules are appended. If I turn off
DMA using hdparm, I don't get a lockup.
This wasn't always a problem. The last time I used my CD-ROM it worked
fine. My motherboard is an Asus P2B-D (dual PIII).
				Regards,
					Richard....
