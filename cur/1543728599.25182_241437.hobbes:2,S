platform devices are still a reminance of the previous PM model
incarnation, and where merely patched over to make them work again
in todays model.
It would be nice to have a proper platform_device_driver structure
so we could finally kill the otherwise unused PM methods in struct
device_driver and finally get rid of the old PM model.
