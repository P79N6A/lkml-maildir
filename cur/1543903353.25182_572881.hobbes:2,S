AFAIK the tifm_7xx1 module belongs to the other card reader I have on
this laptop (see device ID 09.04.0). This one is a cardbus device and I
can simply disconnect it on startup, and the tifm_7xx1 modulo is never
loaded. Anyway I've tried without this card and module and it still
doesn't work.
The other card reader (device 09:04.2) is the hardwired one and I can't
disconnect it :( If only I was sure that this was the problem, I would
gladly open my laptop and cut this card reader's wires :)
