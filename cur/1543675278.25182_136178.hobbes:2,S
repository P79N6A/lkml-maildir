And this is probably the cause of my hardware sensors (it87.ko) not
working :-). Here is what modules.dep for my 2.4.20 kernel says:
/lib/modules/2.4.20-xfsip/kernel/drivers/sensors/it87.o:
    /lib/modules/2.4.20-xfsip/kernel/drivers/i2c/i2c-core.o \
    /lib/modules/2.4.20-xfsip/kernel/drivers/i2c/i2c-proc.o
And here what it says for my 2.5.70 kernel:
/lib/modules/2.5.70/kernel/drivers/i2c/chips/it87.ko: /lib/modules/2.5.70/kernel/drivers/i2c/i2c-sensor.ko /lib/modules/2.5.70/kernel/drivers/i2c/i2c-core.ko
Or maybe something changed in the meantime, and problems are in
user-space, the fact is it doesn't work:
server:~# sensors -v
sensors version 2.6.5
As seen on lm_sensors' home page, it seems the are still porting i2c and
lm_sensors to recent 2.5.x kernels, so maybe the problem is there. They
advise against trying to compile both i2c and lm_sensors for 2.5.x
kernels, because probably they won't work.
Hope this helps.
