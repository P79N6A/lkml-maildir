Tried exactly as you said. Same problem. Here:
mastersj@periscope mastersj]$ dd if=/dev/zero of=tmpfile bs=1k count=100
100+0 records in
100+0 records out
[mastersj@periscope mastersj]$ su
Password:
[root@periscope mastersj]# losetup -e rc6 /dev/loop0 tmpfile
Password :
ioctl: LOOP_SET_STATUS: Invalid argument
[root@periscope mastersj]#
