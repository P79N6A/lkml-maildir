My chipset is VIA apollo 133-A ( old shirt).
I have run bonnie++ just like bonnie -s 256 , and i have 128 MB of memory,
disk is MAXTOR 52049H4.With old kernels i always had results something like i have with 2.4.13-pre now .
And i have read one post in lkml about 2 times less write output with 2.4.13 -pre comparing with ac,
mine result are opposite.
