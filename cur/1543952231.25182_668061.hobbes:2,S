Given that the problem manifested with 8527* in the past (w/ whatever config)
then 4d97* just cannot be a guilty commit (== the one introducing the problem).
IOW the 8527* and later commits just make the issue more likely to occur
(moreover there should be no difference in configs between 8527* and 4d97*).
I guess that re-doing bisection between 2.6.24 and 8527* may be fruitless
but maybe somebody has some idea how we can proceed further with debugging
the hang instead?  Jens/Ingo?
Thanks,
