Subject: e2fsck, LVM and 4096-char block problems

Precedence: bulk

Using Linus' 2.4.10, unpatched.  (Perhaps I need to patch the LVM stuff ;-)
I wanted to extend /usr/src from 19G to 20G.
I umounted /usr/src, lvextend -L +1G /dev/vg01/src, fsck -f /usr/src,
resize2fs /dev/vg01/src
resize2fs tells me to run fsck.  Hmmmm... I just did.
I poke around a bit more and notice the following:
Oct 19 11:45:41 thune kernel: ll_rw_block: device 3a:00: only 4096-char
blocks implemented (1024)
Of course, dumpe2fs says:
Block size:               4096
I tried -f on the resize, and got LOTS of the 4096-char messages.
Some perhaps pertinent information.

Obviously I have the option of creating a new volume and moving things over
to that, but that sort of defeats the purpose of these particular tools.
Recommended course of action?
