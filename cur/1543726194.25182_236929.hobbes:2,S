Well, that's not necessarily a need: provided that the *mix program you
uses does unmute, there's no trouble: I tested aumix, which does fine,
and alsamixer, which indeed doesn't unmute, but has a key for this, and
it fact, in might be useful to change volume level while muted, and then
suddenly unmute.
