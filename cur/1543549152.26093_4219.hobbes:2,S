Dear All,
Platforms
==========
Linux 2.2.17 with ide & raid patches.
Problems
========
We recently purchased an IDE Card (HPT370 chipsets) and connected two 540MB hard
disks (PIO 3) to it.
During booting up, the hard disks could be recognized.  However, it wait a long 
time before proceeding the loading of the resources such as eth0, httpd.
The followings are displayed during boot up:
...
hde:hde: timeout waiting for DMA
ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_timeout func only: 14
hde: irq timeout: status=0x5a { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest Index }
hde: timeout waiting for DMA
ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_timeout func only: 14
hde: irq timeout: status=0x5a { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest Index }
hde: timeout waiting for DMA
ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_timeout func only: 14
hde: irq timeout: status=0x5a { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest Index }
hde: timeout waiting for DMA
ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_timeout func only: 14
hde: irq timeout: status=0x5a { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest Index }
hde: DMA disabled
ide2: reset: success

Grateful for anyone's assistance.
