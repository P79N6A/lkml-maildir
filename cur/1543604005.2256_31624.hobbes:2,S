   Any ideas how to make lowest 4MB allocatable throu
   kmalloc(size, GFP_DMA) without breaking the kernel?
Setup ZONE_DMA correctly at boot time.
See the code around the free_area_init() call in
arch/i386/mm/init.c for an example of how to do this.
Intel does it for the low 16MB, you would just do it
for the low 4MB.
Franks a lot,
