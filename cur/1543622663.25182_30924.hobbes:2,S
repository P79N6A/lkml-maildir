Hi,
We are currently porting Linux 2.4.7 on ADs- Graphics Client Plus board.
We are facing a problem as described below:-
We would like to know in what way we can get the help/consultancy
for the below mentioned problem.
Problem definition:-
We have modified the kernel source code to make Standard Linux
real time in the following way:-
1) For each IRQ line we have created a kernel thread(eg:-ethernet,serial,LCD
and keyboard)
   The driver handler is invoked from this thread.(The handlers for the
drivers are installed at
   boot time)
2) The bottom half is now a kernel thread.
3) and signal queing (for timer only) is also a kernel thread.
We are facing the following problem while booting:-
After the initial boot message
Uncompressing Linux.........................done,booting the kernel the
system hangs.
We debugged the head-armv.S file and we made the following observations :-
In the head-armv.S we added the following debugging statements to find the
sequence
		mov	r0, #F_BIT | I_BIT | MODE_SVC	@ make sure svc mode
		msr	cpsr_c, r0			@ and all irqs disabled
>>		bl	SYMBOL_NAME(myfunction1)
		bl	__lookup_processor_type
		teq	r10, #0				@ invalid processor?
		moveq	r0, #'p'			@ yes, error 'p'
>>		bl	SYMBOL_NAME(myfunction1)
		beq	__error
>>		bl	SYMBOL_NAME(myfunction1)
		bl	__lookup_architecture_type
		teq	r7, #0				@ invalid architecture?
		moveq	r0, #'a'			@ yes, error 'a'
		beq	__error
>>		bl	SYMBOL_NAME(myfunction1)
		bl	__create_page_tables
		adr	lr, __ret			@ return address
.........
.........
__error:
>>		bl	SYMBOL_NAME(myfunction2)
#ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_LL
		mov	r8, r0				@ preserve r0
		adr	r0, err_str
		bl	printascii
		mov	r0, r8
		bl	printch
where myfunction1 and myfunction2 are function defined in the init/main.c
file
void myfunction1()
{
puts("Test1\n");
}
void myfunction2()
{
puts("Test2\n");
}
The following output occurs on booting
Uncompressing Linux...................................done,booting the
kernel
Test1
Test1
Test2
This indicates that the __lookup_processor_type fails.
Could you find a possible solution?
