Hi Shem,
Disclaimer: I have no idea how the input interface works currently. And
I don't know what problem you are trying to solve. I just thought my
hwmon-oriented comments might help.

"A or B, whichever is later", effectively means "A and B". Or am I
missing something? I fail to see the difference between min_wait and
min_fresh.

The hwmon interface (sysfs now, procfs before) has been returning
cached values by defaut for years. Changing this at this point might be
confusing. I don't see much benefit in waiting for updated values
compared to reading them from the cache. The driver knows better how
frequently it can read from the chip. And no hardware monitoring chip I
know of can tell when the monitored value has changed - you have to read
the chip registers to know.

I don't see the point in the 700ms rule. If you don't want new data
more often than once per second, the readouts will be spaced by one
second, which implies > 700ms already.

No seek(fd, ..., 0) here? sysfs files are supposed to be simple text
files, aren't they?
