I noticed that Jonathan brought back waiting.. that (among others)
made me veeeeery interested.

(And that's why)  Among other things (yes, I do love throughput) I've
poked at the interactivity problem. I can't improve it anymore without
doing some strategic waiting :(  I used to be able to help it a little
by doing a careful roll-up in scrub size as load builds.. trying to
smooth the transition from latency oriented to hammer down throughput.
