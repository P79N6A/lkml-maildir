  I was putting a possible approach. I am not familiar to the Linux code. So I am
  not in a position to answer this. But from what i gathered to the response from
  people here in one of my earlier posting regarding this to this list, is that it's 
  not the easiest thing.
  I am sure others who are knowledgable at Linux mm code can throw more light on this.
 thanks,
 Rama.
