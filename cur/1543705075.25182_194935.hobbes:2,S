Subject: crash when using dma for cdrom drive

I have an MSIDDR motherboard, model k7t266 pro2 ver. 2.0.
When I enable dma for my cdrom drive using hdparm /dev/hdc, dma is turned on.
However, when I try and access the drive, my computer crashes.
In a console this is the text that I see : 
dma timeout error : status=0x50 {Drive Ready SeekComplete}
ide-scsi : abort called for 1629
bad : scheduling while atomic !
call trace : 
******( a whole bunch of information is here)
and then something like hdc dma reset complete.
I have tested this with a different cdrom drive and a different ide cable and 
the same thing happens.
The cdrom is the only device on the ide chain.
I am running a vanilla linux kernel 2.6.1 and am using the via chipset driver.
Debian unstable is my distribution.
I have searched google to no avail.
I have looked at various bios options but none seem interesting.
Any help would be appreciated with this problem.
Thanks in advance.
Mathieu
