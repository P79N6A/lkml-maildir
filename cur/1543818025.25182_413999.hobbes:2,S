It's very light-weight now. A lock of course would only be page local,
so it wouldn't really harm scalability, however it would slow down the
single threaded case. At the moment, single threaded performance of
find_get_page is anywhere from about 15-100% faster than before the
lockless patches.
I don't see why you think there needs to be a lock? Before the write
side clears PageNoNewRefs, they will have moved 'page' out of pagecache,
so when this loop breaks, the subsequent test will fail and this
function will be repeated.
