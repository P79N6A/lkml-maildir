Should we fall back to searching if someone's specified an address?  If not,
it becomes even simpler:
	if (pirq_table_addr) {
		return pirq_check_routing_table(pirq_table_addr);
	}

This loop would become:
	for (addr = 0xf0000; addr < 0x100000; addr += 16) {

Completely nitpicking, but I think this should be an unsigned long rather
than an int -- physical addresses are normally expressed in terms of
unsigned long.

And you even bothered to update the documentation!  This is definitely
a cut above most of the patches I review ;-)

he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
