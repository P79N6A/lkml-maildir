I had the exact same problem and few were able to help.  However, here's what 
I found was _my_ problem.  I wasn't enabling the x86 options in the kernel 
(duh!).  Make sure that when you compile, you enable "Intel IA32 CPU 
Microcode Support" and "Model Specific Register Support".  What I ended up 
doing was taking a stock RedHat .config file for i386 and looking at what 
they did for their options and started to delete things from there that I 
don't use or need.  Eventually, I just learned what was necessary for a basic 
i386 kernel.  Although I was compiling for 2.4.17 kernel.  Good luck, hope 
this was of some help.
