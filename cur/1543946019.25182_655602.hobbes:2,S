Oops, I think you have misunderstood. The hang happens if I *don't* specify acpi=noirq, whereas in
this case I did. I have already reported the original hang under threads:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0802.0/0895.html
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0802.0/0898.html
So I was actually reporting that I've *worked around* the hang here. The net result is that all my
PCI devices are now placed on IRQ 9, instead of IRQs 16, 17 18 and 19.
Cheers,
Chris
