Speaking of which, since most DIE^WIDE RAID controllers are really software
driven, it may be possible to get the sw module to read the disks off of any
controller
My machine at work has an onboard promise raid controller but I run linux sw
raid0 on 2 of the disks (4 total, other 2 are not in a raid)
I'm not sure about real hardware raid.  Like the Mylex or Adaptec (SCSI)
