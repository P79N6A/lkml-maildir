	That should be fixed. If the author didn't intend to release this under
GPLv2, it should be replaced. If he did, it should be clarified.
	Actually, we have 13 years of use. And I think Ted knows that the kernel is
under GPLv2. ;)
	You can't include something with the Linux kernel if it's not under GPLv2.
And you can't put additional restrictions on GPLv2 code. We all know that, I
think.
