  - block on close() after select(). Even uglier.
  - make unix_gc() sweep such skb's and call it on select() (OK, on
corresponding method).
	Notice that either way we are handling a nasty race to
applications: if all you are going to do is to connect, write something
and close the connection there is no way to know if the data we've passed
will not be eaten by close() - it may happen before accept() on server
end. I'm at loss here - looks like we *have* to do it to avoid DoS found
by Andrea. Are there any other protocol families with non-blocking
connect()? Kstati, interesno chto po etomu powodu skazhet Katelbrunner ;-)
I.e. WTF does 4.4BSD do? Hmm... time to look into FreeBSD kernel. Their GC
misses listen queues, but it's an unrelated exploit, so...
