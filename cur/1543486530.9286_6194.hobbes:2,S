Hello all,
This is "sort of" a kernel related question as well as a ext2fs question:
Is anyone working on the 32-bit addressing problem which limits file size to 
2.1GB?
(I hear screams of anguish - "Who has files larger than 2GB?!??"  We do.  
Gotta love that high energy physics!)
Will 64-bit file system addressing appear only in the kernel for 64-bit chips 
(SPARC, Alpha, Merced, etc.) or can we expect this sometime in the future for 
the "lowly" i386 machines?
Thanks for the info,
Dan
