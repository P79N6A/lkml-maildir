I think we're just going to have to disagree on what "work best" means.  I
choose to interpret it as a measure of driver functionality and
performance.
Your definition of "work best" is based on a political agenda, and not on
technical merit.

Excuse you indeed.  I have.

You will be able to fix a certain subset of possible problems.  Maybe you
can fix an OOPS or BUG if they're obvious enough, and have to do with
kernel interfaces and not the hardware itself.
If the driver is not properly accessing the hardware, and you don't
have the documentation, it's as much a black box to you as nvidia.o.

Of course it is.  And you're doing it again.  Performing that search
doesn't give any evidence that "nvidia is trouble", or even that their
graphics driver is unstable.  But the implication is that nvidia's drivers
will cause me problems.
This is getting quite unfocused.  My intended point is that saying "<foo>
is trouble" without any detail at all is misleading.  It gives the
impression that <foo> may not operate correctly, when the real issue at
hand here is that it is closed source.
