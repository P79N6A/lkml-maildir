Considering that the main use of that file that I know about was
implicit (usbfs is available if its files are present, another
assumption broken in 2.5), I'm not sure I feel any pain... :-)

Actually it does more than that ... it tells you what minor numbers
are assigned to the drivers _currently loaded_ which means that it's
not really useful the instant someone plugs in another device.
You can't use it to allocate numbers or tell what /dev/file/name matches
a given device ... so what is its value, other than providing a limited
minor number counterpart to /proc/devices?  (Which, confusingly, doesn't
list devices but major numbers.)
