No, no special ASI exists to do that, although it would be nice. :-)
I'd have to use a prefetch for write.
BTW, it is interesting that you can use CAS to get a cache line into
the local processor in Owned state with %100 certainty (unlike
prefetch for write which might get cancelled) by doing something like:
	CAS	[MEM], ZERO, ZERO
and you can do this to any valid memory address without changing the
contents.  This is useful for doing things like resetting parity bits
while doing memory error recorvery.

For both MOESI and MOSI cache coherency protocols, misses on loads
result in a Shared state cache line when another processor has the
data in it's cache too, regardless of whether that line in the other
cpu is dirty or not.
When the write comes along, the next transaction occurs to kick it
out the other cpu(s) caches and then the local line is placed into
Owned state.
I'll have to add "put write prefetch in CAS sequences" onto my sparc64
TODO list :-)
