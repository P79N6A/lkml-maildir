it's trivial to change the order in the freelist to allocate from lower
address first, but the point is still that over time that will be
random.
the 16M must be reserved enterely to the __GFP_DMA on any machine with
>=1G of ram, and the lowmem_reserve_ratio algorithm accomplish this and
it scales down the reserve ratio according to the balance between lowmem
and dma zone.
I believe if something you should try with GFP_KERNEL if GFP_DMA fails,
not the other way around. btw, 2.6 is even more efficient in shrinking
and paging out the dma zone than it could be in 2.4.
