The spacing thing is definately a matter for argument elsewhere.  I
cirtainly have no real oppinion on the matter.  As has been said
elsewhere the coding style is not meant to be as everyone likes it, more
a minimally offensive common position generating consistancy out of
caos.
Checkpatch is _meant_ to push you towards the recommendations in
CodingStyle, that is the definative resource; common sense should prevail
over it.  <standard message>checkpatch is a style guide only, think
about its output and be prepared to justify any non-complience.</standard
message>.
The second one is a clear falsie which I believe I have fixed for the
next release, rather over zelous "possible type" detection has fired here.
ERROR: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
#123: FILE: arch/x86/kernel/microcode.c:248:
+                         EXT_SIGNATURE_SIZE * i;
Cheers.
