I get that, but my concern was primarily with the increasing build durations of
the kernel whenever new modules get added in and people want them to be built on
as many systems as possible so as to catch as more bugs as possible. But since
we _want_ that, diskspace is not an issue. 
However, it still does not help that much since I can only test-build the module 
but not test-use it for I don't have the hardware.
