They are hotplug buses.  But the buses themselves are always there (and not
hotplugged. i.e. the bus doesn't appear and disappear).  Whether they should
be bothering acpiphp, I don't know.  
You have a lot of buses that support hotplugging in the X60, and at least
one is certainly exported to the dock unless IBM/Lenovo changed completely
the way they make docks, which I very much doubt.  That was the information
I was trying to convey.   As I said, I don't know if *these* buses should be
bothering acpiphp or not.
