You can help yourself by applying Manfred's patch to 8390.c (in preference to
my own patch to the same file). This will sove the hanging-network problem. If
your entire box hangs, that's another story which will probably not be fixed by
that patch. You can find the patch in Manfred's posting to the list from Fri
Jan 12 2001 - 14:04:24 EST.
I've been running a patched driver for more than a day now, under heavy network
load, without problems.
