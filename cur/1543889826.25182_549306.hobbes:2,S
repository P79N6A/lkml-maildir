And how many people have picked up on the fact that the fix in 2.6.22rc is busted
in the last week ?
Ie, we'd be waiting probably until after .22 goes out before we found out it's
still horked, and leaving .21.x busted for another three weeks.
If the functionality is completely busted in -stable, adding a patch that's
isolated to that component can't really make things much worse.
All we've done here is move the breakage.
