I use an IBM Deskstar 180GB IDE disk and tried out TCQ on 2.6.0-test1-mm2.
I have a VIA IDE interface on my A7V8X motherboard. This corrupted my
ReiserFS file system, just by running the same reiserfsck utility that
works well without TCQ. So at least on this disk/controller, IDE-TCQ
probably doesn't work well.
