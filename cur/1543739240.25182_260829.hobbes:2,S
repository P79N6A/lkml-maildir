This makes sense, assuming the gcc info pages are correct:
`unused'
     This attribute, attached to a function, means that the function is
     meant to be possibly unused.  GCC will not produce a warning for
     this function.  GNU C++ does not currently support this attribute
     as definitions without parameters are valid in C++.
`used'
     This attribute, attached to a function, means that code must be
     emitted for the function even if it appears that the function is
     not referenced.  This is useful, for example, when the function is
     referenced only in inline assembly.
So, a function could be "used" and "unused" at the same time:
	unused -> don't warn
	used -> don't discard
