I don't think normal readb/writeb should know about EEH either. If you 
want error handling, there's a separate interface being worked on, so that 
normal accesses don't have to pay the cost..

Ok, so that _is_ insane. Mind telling what kind of insane hardware is BE 
in this day and age?

should work, and if you start using it, and the driver is relevant, I'm 
sure other architectures will implement the __raw_ interfaces too. In the 
meantime, please just make it conditional on the proper architectures.
