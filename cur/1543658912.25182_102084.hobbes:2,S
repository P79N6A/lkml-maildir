It's easier to get my employer to pay for my time to fix software issues
with the laptop they paid for than it is to get them to shell out money
for what they'd consider a hardware workaround.  And even at "fairly
cheaply", I'm not going to buy it out of my own pocket.  It's a hell of
a lot easier to simply skip ACPI till somebody (perhaps I) figure out how
to fix it... ;)
