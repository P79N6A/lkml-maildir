The one special thing about unsuspend is that it does a "yenta_init()",
the same way the bootup sequence does (but the module load sequence should
have done it too, so it's still a bit strange). 
Could you test things out a bit, playing with the settings in
yenta_init()? I wonder if it is the pci_set_power_state() stuff that does
something unexpected.. 
Can you remove both "pci_set_power_state()" calls in the yenta driver (one
in init, one in suspend) and see if that makes any difference?
The other things to test is to disable the code that sets the
CB_BRIDGE_CONTROL register (again in yenta_init()), and the code that
clears I365_GBLCTL and I365_GENCTL.. See what it is in yenta_init() that
triggers the strange keyboard controller shutdown, basically.
