Well, the forced revalidation was an attempt to protect "user-data"
from root, which, as you pointed out in your reply, is a somewhat
sketchy thing.  It may also be useful if you wish to share a
filesystem/namespace with a subset of users with a permissions model
outside of the normal user/groups model (which the user doesn't really
have any control over).
Anyways, just an additional idea for consideration -- as I said, I
don't really feel a strong need for this, so perhaps its best
forgotten for now.
