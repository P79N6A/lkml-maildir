Hee hee.  When I first saw this happening back in 1999, I tried to talk to Dell first but
after about an hour on the phone with the support guy trying to explain what VESA BIOS
Extensions were, and why running the Dell diagnostics disk would not solve my problem, I
decided I'd just fix it in software.  Can I get an amen for an open source operating
system?
