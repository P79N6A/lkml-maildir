Not really. Large installations use ACLs instead of groups. 
Why? Because if we have 2^31 users, there might be a slight
chance, that we need more then 32 group memberships per user.
So let's better stop relying more and more on this group brain
damage and start supporting ACLs. We can support building ACL
groups, but please let the user and not the admin build them.
It's called user data, because the user owns it and should
decide, which people are allowed to access it. 
Please look at AFS groups, to see what I mean.
All serious admins I know miss the ACL feature in Linux. One
product even emulates them via groups.
