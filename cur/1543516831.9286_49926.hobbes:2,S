I'm not sure if Linux capabilities predates kmod or not, but I'm pretty
sure none of us who hacked kmod gave capabilities a second thought.

I suppose kmod should start modprobe with the same capabilities as
init_task and friends have. Right now, the only real difference is
that modprobe gets CAP_SETPCAP which init_task et al don't.
On the other hand, when started via kmod, modprobe _is_ essentially
part of the kernel and we do have to trust it. Even if we limit an
adversarial modprobe to CAP_SYS_MODULE, it will still be able to do
anything, since it can insert and run arbitrary code in the kernel.
The patch below will change kmod to start modprobe with the same
capabilities as init_task has. It doesn't seem to break anything for me,
but I don't think it improves security in any real sense either.
