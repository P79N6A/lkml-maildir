What the hell?  You *do* realize that seq_read() will increase the buffer
size if it can't fit the single entry into the current buffer, don't you?
Guys, there is no 4Kb limit.  At all.  You get longer entries - fine, the
thing will work.  It will grow buffer large enough to hold the longest
entry, though.
You don't *have* to preallocate buffer - it makes sense to do if you know
that one page will be too tight anyway, but it's not required.
You obviously want to keep entries reasonably small - exactly because users
can open the file and start reading from it.  Which will allocate (besides
the things normally allocated for any opened file) a buffer for said entries.
As long as it stays within several pages, there's no problem - after all,
you can always open a pipe and write to it / open a pair of AF_UNIX sockets
and send yourself datagrams / etc.  It's not that situation was unusual.
If you get buffer much bigger than that, you are asking for a DoS, obviously.
