That wouldn't do what I want. Besides which, I've tried it on Apache and it 
doesn't work. Apache isn't fooled by fifos called something.html Nor are most 
browsers either.
1. The "other end" of the named pipe would be run under the identity of 
whoever kicked off that daemon process not the user who wanted to access it.
2. The environment etc would be that which the "other end" was kicked off 
with, not what you might want it to be when the thing is accessed. In your 
example the stuff up to the "(date) >livepipe" will all get run, and then 
things will get suspended until there is a reader for "livepipe" by which 
time all the work you've done up to that point might be invalidated.
3. There would be no way of getting at the invoking environment, supposing for 
example you wanted to give a different response to different users?
4. In the example I quoted where you want to have a "give me a tarball of the 
latest version of package X" link you'd have to have one continually-running 
process to serve package X, one for package Y, one for package Z and so 
forth.
