Is good.  Thanks.

I'm a little surprised that desktop users do notice significant
benefits with all the latency/preempt patches.  If you actually
instrument the kernel's behaviour, the stalls are in fact
quite small and infrequent.  See the histograms in
 
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0201.0/1624.html
Probably, poor interactivity on the desktop is more due to
waiting on disk reads - a combination of bad read latency
in the presence of write traffic and unfortunate page replacement
decisions.
Try

The simplest tool to use is Mark Hahn's `realfeel' app.  See
