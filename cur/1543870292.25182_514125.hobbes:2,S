Heh, yeah. That would indeed explain some strange gdb behaviour. It
will only trigger when single-stepping into an exception or interrupt
handler so thanks for pointing it out; I would have had a hard time
figuring it out on my own...
I don't think either of those need to be atomic though, since both of
them happen in monitor mode with interrupts disabled.
