I don't see why you are concerned. If the CKRM=n path is zero impact
then its irrelevant to you. Its more expensive to do a lot of resource
management at the VMM level because the virtualisation engine doesn't
know anything but its getting indications someone wants to be
bigger/smaller.

Bingo - and areas the virtualiser can't see into, at least not unless it
uses the same hooks CKRM uses
