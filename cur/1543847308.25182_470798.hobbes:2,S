If something_ops is NULL, catastrophic consequences ensue either way.
It's just as bad even if address 0 isn't mmap'ed with PROT_EXEC.  For
example, suppose that .thingy is at offset 0x14 (say) and something_ops
is NULL.  Then (*something_ops->thingy)() reads 4 bytes from address
0x14, treats what the 4 bytes read as an address, and transfers control
to that address.  (On a 32-bit x86.)  Since the latter address is under
the attacker's control, this means that the kernel has just transferred
control to an address of the attacker's choosing -- not good.
As you say, if something_ops->thingy is NULL, then mmap'ing address 0
with PROT_EXEC allows evil consequences.
