Harder to do than you might think - it has to deal with the fact that
2.6.N might have a warning about 'used unintialized on line 430', and
in 2.6.N+1 you get two warnings, one on line 420 and one on 440.  Which
one is new and which one just moved 10 lines up or down?  Or did a patch
fix the one on 430 and add 2 new ones?
