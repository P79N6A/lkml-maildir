I don't think that I explained that correctly.  The dm code clones the
bio and sets the bi_idx to point to where the IO should start.  Then
when __blk_queue_bounce gets called, it only fills in its bio starting
at bi_idx (it uses bio_for_each_segment) and since it calls bio_alloc
instead of bio_clone, any pages it doesn't fill in are NULL.  I suppose
we could call bio_clone instead of bio_alloc in __blk_queue_bounce and
fill in the whole bio.
