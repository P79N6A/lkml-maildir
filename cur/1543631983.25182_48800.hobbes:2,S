That's a good start, but it's not enough.  There remains the question of
additional restrictions relating to other programs/hardware/whatever.  The 
Fsmlabs RTLinux patent license is a good example of such additional 
restrictions.  This license restricts the royalty-free grant to software 
that is not realtime, or to software that cannot be freely modified.  The
license does not discriminate on the basis of linking, as the GPL does, but
rather, on the nature of the application.
While it's an open question whether or not this is a suitable way for
Fsmlabs to license their patent, it seems clear that similar restrictions
would be entirely inappropriate for a Linux vendor.
