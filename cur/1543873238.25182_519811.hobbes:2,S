    Until I discovered how to reproduce the bug, I had to reboot for
each test. But I discovered the real problem...
    The garbling doesn't happen, no matter the udelay, until I start X.
Once X is started, even with an udelay(100) (which for me makes the
display untolerably slow) the problem happens.
    This doesn't happen in latest 2.4.x, but I remember that some
characters "dissappeared" from the screen at some 2.4.x when X was
running. That was a known bug in the X driver of this card, so I'm not
sure if the last X.Org driver has this problem or not. Unfortunately, I
cannot test this directly, the most I can do is to test under Ubuntu,
which uses an older 2.6.x kernel.
    If this new discovery doesn't ring any bell for you, I'll make a
test under Ubuntu and after that I'll just wait until I can upgrade X
(which I cannot do now) to latest X.Org (I'm now using 7.0.22).
    Thanks for all your help. I'll keep you informed of any change I
notice, and (although I won't be very fast doing it...) you can count on
me to test any patch you want.
