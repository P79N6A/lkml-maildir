Hi,
    I did HDIO_DRIVE_RESET ioctl, but system hung without any response,
only printed some mesages from kernel(v2.4.20):
hda: DMA disabled
hda: ide_set_handler: handler not null; old=c01ce300, new=c01d4400
bug: kernel timer added twice at c01ce102
     would you please help me with it?
Regards
rain.w
