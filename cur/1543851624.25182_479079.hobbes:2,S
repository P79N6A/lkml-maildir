I can reproduce it 100% with:
$ git checkout -b test v2.6.17.14
$ git-am -3 tmp/000[1-8]*
  (see 
https://www.cvg.de/people/ensc/libutil/
 for patches and
   used .config (config.txt); the physmap patches are from 2.6.18)
$ make tftp
--> 'fillmem ; test' sequences work without errors
$ git-cherry-pick 4f3865fb57a04db7cca068fed1c15badc064a302
$ make tftp
--> 'fillmem ; test' sequences stop with a segfault
I compiled kernel both with gcc-3.4.6 and gcc-4.1.1 and got same
results.
Same results when using recent 2.6.18.1 kernel and reverting all
patches which modified lib/zlib_*.
I see segfaults too with 2.6.19-rc4 but did not checked yet
whether removal of zlib patch solved them.
Things are getting yet more strange when using the glibc-2.5
dynamic loader:
| # ... copying ld-2.5.so and libc-2.5.so ...
| # LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd` ./ld-2.5.so /bin/test2
| Inconsistency detected by ld.so: dynamic-link.h: 169: elf_get_dynamic_info: Assertion `info[19]->d_un.d_val == sizeof (Elf32_Rel)' failed!
| # LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd` ./ld-2.5.so /bin/test2

Issue:
* seems to be triggered by the zlib kernel patch
* seems to be triggered by my 'libutil.so' (I can not see it with
  other libraries)
* can be reproduced on two different PXA270 platforms (same
  userspace, but different module vendors and different memory
  timing setups)
I see the following reasons:
* new zlib code has sideeffects (overflows?)
* new zlib code is so fast that it triggers a race somewhere else
* libutil.so's .init section is buggy (likely, but why does the
  error not occur when libutil.so is on tmpfs or NFS?)
* new zlib code requires more/less memory bandwidth, changes
  power consumption of CPU/memory which is causing random errors
  (unlikely because only same part of .got table is affected and
  it happens on two different platforms)
* some DCACHE issue
> Which other related patches did you remove?
For 2.6.18 tests, I reverted only the patches which changed
lib/zlib_* after 2.6.17:
