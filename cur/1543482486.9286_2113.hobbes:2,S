This thread isn't helping anybody. :)  "Socket destroy delayed" is purely
an old debugging message and has nothing to do with the ethernet card you
are using.  DaveM reported earlier that he had a brain-o and forgot to
remove it from a previous pre-2.2.0 kernel.  You can replicate it quite
easily; ping an IP that is unused on the local network of one of your
devices and hit ^C -- you should see the message.  Either remove it from
your current kernel (linux/net/ipv4/af_inet.c) or wait for (probably) the
next kernel.
