I don't think so, ask google for LLP64 and click the second link (blogs),
you will like it :-)
Basically, they choose LLP64 because they have declared some structures
as LONG (eg: in bitmaps) instead of making them int32 ! I didn't know
that they were losers to the point of not understanding a typedef !
This may explain why they stopped supporting alpha long ago...

it seems so, but I'd be interested in counter-examples too.
