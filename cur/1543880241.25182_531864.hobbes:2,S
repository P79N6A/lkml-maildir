Thank you.  Then I misunderstood, and I owe you an apology.  Thank you
for your patience and for correcting my mistaken impression.
For what it's worth, I agreed with most or all of the comments you made
in your original response to the FAQ posted here.  I thought they were
constructive.  What got me to ranting was an email from Karl MacMillan
that seemed focused more on debating the merits of AppArmor rather than
on improving the FAQ.
