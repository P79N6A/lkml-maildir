Jamie, if you use the one thread per connection model you don't need epoll
at all. The std poll() scale very well with one fd :) If you're using a
N:1 (N connections over one thread/task) you definitely need either a
state machine or something like coroutines. With futex->poll() (under
epoll) you can easily create the object you need to solve your server
problem. You create an object (structure) that contain the futex and a
list of coroutines/state-structures. You drop the pointer to this
structure inside data.ptr of the epoll fd data. When you get an event you
invoke/proceed with a FIFO order. When an object wait on this "mutex" you
drop the calling coroutine/state-structure inside the list tail. All those
ops (getting data from epoll event, removing list head, adding to tail)
are lightning fast. Actually, strictly speaking, you don't even need a
futex to do this with a N:1 model :) But you do need it for a N:M (M > 1) model.
