Yes, this is correct.

I'm not sure I entirely understand what you're asking here; perhaps  
you could rephrase or explain what you're trying to do?  From what I  
can pick up from your description; you may be missing that program  
text pages and memory-mapped files may be "swapped-out" even  
*without* a swap device.  As an example, when I first start /bin/bash  
(ignoring readahead for the moment), very little of the binary and  
shared libraries are actually in memory (the rest is left on disk).   
When I use data or call a function that hasn't been loaded from disk  
yet, a major fault occurs, the kernel loads data from the bash  
executable file or a shared library, and then maps it into the  
process address space.
