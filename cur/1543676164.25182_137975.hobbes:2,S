/dev/hda1 probably won't work, as "hda1" don't exist in devfs until
devfsd starts.  The "/dev/ide/.../part1" should work though,
if devfs is configured to mount automatically.
Try to rule out modules problems, make a kernel where
everything is compiled in.  If you aren't using a initrd
then at least devfs, the fs used on your root, and the drivers
for your ide controller _must_ be compiled in because
modules cannot be loaded until _after_ the root
fs is mounted.
I can't help you if you're using an initrd, I don't know
those.  2.5.70-mm4 and those earlier kernels that don't
die from RAID problems boot fine for me, with root
on a RAID-1 consisting of two IDE or SCSI disks.

My guess is that the driver for the "301" device (IDE) is
modular somehow, and this module isn't loaded from some
initrd when you try to mount root.
Debian don't _need_ an initrd if you compile the fs and drivers
into the kernel image as I explained above.  If you use one, you
need to set it up right.  The initrd must contain necessary modules
for the kernel you are trying to boot, in this case 2.5.70.
Also, 2.5.70 needs different modutils than 2.4.16, so debian's
supplied initrd will perhaps not work with 2.5.70.
If setting up an initrd is hard for you, consider dropping
it and go for the non-modular solution.
Stuff not needed for the boot (i.e. usb scanners and such)
may still be modular if you want them to, as modules & devfsd
works after the root is mounted. (And if they fail
you'll be able to work around or fix it at that time.)
