I compiled with -fno-builtins, in addition to what you advise, and found
that abs() was an indefined symbol. I added an abs() macro to
../linux/include/stddef.h, i.e.,
	#define abs(a) (((a)>=0)?(a):-(a))
And included this header in ../linux/arch/i386/kernel/timer.c, and
../linux/fs/open.c, where it was being used.
The result is that I can now boot the '486 from a kernel built on
my 686.
I do not know what header should really contain this macro so I did
not make a patch. I note that other macros like min() and max() are
defined for specific devices (wanpipe.h) and probably should be
moved to a common header file.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson

Penguin : Linux version 2.3.13 on an i686 machine (400.59 BogoMips).
