heh. I'd attribute it to the fact that it's tedious monotonous work
doing cleanup work like this, as opposed to 'sexy' work, like hacking
on something new.  Personally, I've always found something more important
to be doing.  Maybe I can find some more time to look into it soon.

The __HAVE_ stuff is another pet gripe of mine.
In particular, the mish-mash of __HAVE_AGP , __REALLY_HAVE_AGP, __MUST_HAVE_AGP
flags have bugged me for a long time.

I'm hesitant to name them, but there are drivers in the tree which
whilst not shining examples of what-to-do, they do a far better
job of running on both OS's. Some with abstraction layers and such,
but with nothing remotely as convoluted as drm IMO.

Reminds me of someone I know who starts amusing stories with the
sentence.. "So, we had a few beers and...", though after reading
some of that code I suspect something much stronger 8-)

I vaguelly recall the code at one point not looking quite 'so bad',
it just grew and grew into this monster.  I'm sure it was done originally
with the best of intentions, but it seems someone along the line got
a bit carried away.

Maybe we can introduce that code as a starting point :-)

Sure. One thing that the DRM code has actually done right is to move the
bits that need arbitration to the kernel, whilst leaving all the fun
bits in userspace. (well, mostly).

I think with a coordinated effort, and with an ACK by the folks who maintain
this code on a day-to-day basis, it's worth at least heading in the right
direction.

Sounds realistic.  As I mentioned in my last mail, my 'work on one driver
at a time, ridding it of macros etc' led to nothing mergable, and was only
just at the stage where it was compiling again. I'd warn off anyone trying
to do what I tried. I learned a few things along the way, but the end result
wasn't where any of us want things to be.
