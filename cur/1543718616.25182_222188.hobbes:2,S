Hello everyone,
Today morning I've made a test about the thead and child process
creation(fork) time on both 2.4 and 2.6 kernels.
The test systems
================
Box A:
 - kernel: Linux 2.4.22-xfs
 - CPU: Intel P3-700 MHz (slot1)
 - Ram: 384MB SDR SDRAM
Box B:
 - kernel: Linux 2.6.6-mm5
 - CPU: Intel P4-2.6Ghz
 - Ram: 512 DDR SDRAM
Box B is a lot better, but it doesn't metter according to the test,
because the aim was to get the ratio of the two times with different
sample rates.
The sample rates
================
I've chosen a low, a middle and a higher sample rate for the test, they
was 20,128 and 255 samples.
Notice in the attached source that every child processes and threads are
terminated right after creation, and only the creation function call is
timed. It was interesting that when I've chosed a _very_ high sample rate,
about 10^8 there was a lot of failures, the kernel could only create about
4K child processes, and after this all the thread creations failed. As I
told it above all the processes are teminated right after creation, but
there were a lot of defunct processes in the system, and they were only
gone when the parent termineted.
With a few number of processes I wasn't able to go over 255 threads,
after the 255th every creation attempt simply failed.
The test outputs

Total thread time: 6.561000 msecs
Avarage fork/thread ratio: 9.393080
Total fork/thread ratio: 9.393080
Conlusion
=========
It's easy to notice that in case of 2.4 the ratios of the creation times
are converges to 1, so it depends on the load, while in case of a 2.6
kernel the ratios are mostly fix, about 9. This means that creating a new
child process takes much more time than creating a new thread.
