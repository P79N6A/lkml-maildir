Umm - they should be. Otherwise CPUID would be completely useless.
I double checked both the Intel and the x86-64 manual now and bit 19 
of 0000_0001 is CLFLUSH 
So cpufeature.h and the x86-64 test is correct
0000_0001 is supposed to be globally compatible. 8000_0001 
is supposed to be compatible inside AMD CPUs (and 19 is reserved here)
Ivan confused me.  Either he read the application note wrong or it is wrong.
