Hi,
Admittedly I was being pathological, but I've got a new toy to play with!
Our new server is a dual-Athlon, 1.5G RAM (the other .5 failed memtest) +
about 6GB swap, with 15x70GB drives running under gdth.o with 12 as the
RAID-5 set, and the journal on 2 as a RAID-1 pair. System on IDE for now.
It's currently running Red Hat "severn" + 2.6.0-test2-mm1 (with PREEMPT
for now), and this particular stress test was attempting to build 
2.6.0-test3-mm1 with the scary invocation "make -j". More info on request.
I saw thousands of messages like:
	cc1: page allocation failure. order:0, mode:0x20
(where only the process names might change). I don't know how Bad this is.
Amazingly I could still ssh in to the box and discover that its load had
more than likely broken 1000. However, the compile started to complain
bitterly about non-ASCII characters in source files, and indeed corruption
did occur (random overwriting, it would appear).
I have a couple more weeks I can play with this box before it has to go
into production (running much older brains), and can do more tests if
anyone thinks it might be useful.
I would like to suggest the "make -j" test for those developers with
enough memory (and fast enough swap).
Matt
