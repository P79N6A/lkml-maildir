I didn't post the huge patch on l-k because the last time I sent large
patches to l-k I got flamed badly by people who still seem to use 9600
baud modems[1] to read mail.
One thing I am a bit concerned about though is that there seem to be
less pre patches since bitkeeper was introduced and in parallel lots of
patches from people working at the bk HEAD, making syncing more difficult.
I don't want to use BitKeeper because I don't like open logging. I hope
I can continue to maintain the x86-64 port even without being part
of the inner bitkeeper circle. It would be good if you did e.g.
a pre patch for every change that could require action from architecture
or other maintainers as sync point (i guess that could be made easy with
the appropiate script)
Back to the x86-64 merge:
If someone wants it it is at 
ftp.x86-64.org:/pub/linux/v2.5/2.5.8/*
(split in a big patch for arch/asm and separate bug fixes for other parts) 
Comment: 
Changes:
- Sync with 2.5.8
- SMP/APIC supported now. 
- Module loading works now. 
- Time keeping bugs fixed.
- entry.S streamlined and some bugs fixed.
- modify_ldt works now
- mostly rewritten FPU support (including FXRSTOR for initial FPU 
initialization based on the initial state) 
- 32bit emulation enhanced and bugs fixed.
- rewrote mm initialization and lots of cleanups in the page table handling
__PAGE_OFFSET is now moved to 0x10000000000 and some vmalloc/ioremap
problems have been fixed. They have an own PML4 slot now. 
- WCHAN reporting support for RIP (but not RSP) 
- Lots of various other bug fixes and cleanups.

[1] yes, I'm exaggerating, but it was nearly like that.
