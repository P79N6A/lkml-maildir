Ok, but my nforce board works just fine with pata hdd's but doesn't with 
atapi devices on the pata bus, which is what his message was in 
reference to.   So forget about piix and such, how are you _supposed_ to 
get atapi devices seen on the pata drivers (assuming they're functioning 
at all on the pata drivers) so those that are testing these drivers can 
make bug reports about them not working, instead of just possibly 
getting the configuration wrong.
No mention of atapi was made in the last patch / status report so i take 
it You're under the assumption that atapi is _supposed_ to be working in 
pata (at least the drives should be initialized and brought up).  
So if any info is needed, just mention what it is...  the drivers have 
been rock solid so far for my sata and pata hdds. I'd like to continue 
testing with the atapi drive detected because I can't have both ide and 
pata drivers loaded at the same time, and switching between the two 
changes device names around.
