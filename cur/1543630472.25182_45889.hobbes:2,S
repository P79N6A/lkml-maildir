(You're planning to have two queues per channel but sharing the same
lock?)
On the serialisation issue: what does serialisation of the queues with
respect to each other mean to you?  I understand it to mean that we
won't ever call the request_fn of both queues at the same time - because
that's all the actual spinlock buys you.  It does not IIUC mean that you
can't get a call to request_fn of one queue while the other queue has
lots of requests in it (which are potentially being serviced by DMA). 
Or does it?  Does the block layer track which requests are "active"
somehow?
My main question could be posed thus: am I right in thinking that we
MUST track the busy-ness of the channel at all times?  (and for broken
chipsets, track the logical OR of both channels' busy-ness)
