a VMA can only be randomized in 4Kb (well page size) granularity, so the
8Mb randomization can only work in that 4Kb unit, the "second"
randomization can work in 16 byte granularity.

randomization off will slow stuff down yes... you get cache alias
contention that way.

2.4.31 randomizes the stack with 8Kb.

you're not providing a lot of info ;)
why do you suspect randomization as cause for whatever slowdown you are
seeing? What kind of slowdown are you seeing?
