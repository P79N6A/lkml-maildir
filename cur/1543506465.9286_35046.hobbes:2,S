I think this is a feature:
rw-locks can be use partially in interrupts:
* write only from outside interrupts
* read from everywhere
if a writer spins (interupts are enabled), then an interrupt occurs, 
then you have a dead-lock.
WinNT has special "acquire_shared_starve_writer()"-calls but I don't
think this is required.

add your code as a "rw-don't-starve-lock", but I think the normal
rw_lock must starve writers.
