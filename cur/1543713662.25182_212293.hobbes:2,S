My code works during system calls (before the real
one). Interrupts are enabled. If it enters the loop
scheduler still can switch tasks (using timer for
example). If it doesn't work in such way I can easily
call schedule(); implicitly after some time limit will
be reached - it's VM, so it's easy to do such things.
So, it's my pleasure to accept your congratulations
:-) Thanks.
Serge.
