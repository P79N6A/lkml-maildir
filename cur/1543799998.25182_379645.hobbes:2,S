I know.  My intent was to keep the prototype consistent with the
prevailing style of other declarations in that same routine.  If you
think that cleanliness is more important, I'll be happy to change it.

Yeah.  I lost the plot there a bit.  I'll remove the volatiles.

But pointer arithmetic is undefined on void pointers.  gcc lets you do
it, but it treats sizeof(void) as 1, which gives entirely the wrong
results in this case.

Well spotted, thanks.
