ide-features.c: In function `ide_ioctl_verbose':
ide-features.c:144: `HDIO_TRISTATE_HWIF' undeclared (first use in this
function)
ide-features.c:144: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
ide-features.c:144: for each function it appears in.)
delete line 144 out of ./drivers/ide/ide-features.c
I pulled the hotswap-tristate stuff for 2.5 because it was way to new for
2.4.
