Hi!
I have compiled the 2.5.53 kernel, installed rusty's modutils package,
made a symlink modutils.conf-modules.conf, but the modules haven't been
preloaded during boot, and this hangs the cups initscript for me, hoever
iptables is complaining. Does anybody have a modified initscript to
solve the problem, or it is already in rawhide?
