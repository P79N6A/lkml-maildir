Before I murdered in my bad, I want to say, that I agree that changing 
scx200 into scx is easier and probably better idea.
And I will do it(I am doing it right now),

Sorry or answering with a question, but what will you run when typing 
aterm in your shell?
Is it simlink to xterm, or /bin/aterm, or /usr/local/bin/aterm?
It depends on $PATH, with modprobe it depends on something else...
Bug? Probably. Feature? Maybe. I do not complain.

When you want to run exact program, you type the whole path, no?
Load exact modules with known-to-be-good pathes.
I can hack shell script over modprobe to warn if there are several modules 
with the same name, and ask exact path or something...

/sbin/modinfo shows enough information about module to distingiush one from another.

I understand your point of view, and can say, that the same module names are not 
very convenient and some times even confused, but it is not a cause to kill
such idea and mark it as badly broken.
It is right thing, it just currently has some nitpicks, nothing more, noone complains
that modules for different kernel versions have the same name, but different
elf sections in it, it is of course different things, but they do have the same 
roots in common.
As I have beed told in private, 
"what is technically possible, is not necessarily practically useful.", probably
it is the essence.
Thank you for discussion.
