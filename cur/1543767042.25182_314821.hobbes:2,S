Interesting.. this appears to be a completley different issue also
now.  sdb1 is a free space partition (type 0 in fdisk).  Well
apparently that doesn't appear with the new mm's and this is the
source of all my problems.
So I was mistaken about it being overwritten I think... this is a
little more different then I thought.
I use dd if=my_sw.bin of=/dev/sdb1 to copy the image over.. but as the
sdb1 node isn't being created.. its just sending it to a file.  I'll
continue to look more at it now.
Thanks,
Joe
