What state are the tasks in when it hangs, S, R, D, N, T, what?  I have
an intermittent problem on 2.4 where an entire process group goes into
T state even though nothing is tracing it.  Killing the offending
process then sending SIGCONT to the rest of the process group restarts
the group.  The offending process is usually the last one on the tree.
