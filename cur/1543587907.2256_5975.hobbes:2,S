Dealing with events should be disjoint from polling the battery or
powerstatus. Many processes might reasonably simultaneously want to
provide a display to the user of the current power status.
However, button presses and so on should be handled by a single
process. Otherwise the kernel is unreasonably complicated by having to
deal with multiple processes' veto power, which could just as well and
more flexibly be handled in userspace.
I don't why there needs to be an additional daemon constantly running
to deal with button presses and power status changes. Apparently init
is already handling similar things: why should it not be extended to
include button presses?
Alternatively, why not forgo a daemon altogether? (This scheme is
already implemented in the pmpolicy patch, i.e. it is already
working.)

Examples please.
