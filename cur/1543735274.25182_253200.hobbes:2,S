You're asking for implementation details on something I threw out off the
top of my head? My first thought is "not by name" since if this is an
unmount that's not going to work well. Since I'm making this up, let's say
a filesysem number and inode number. Then when the watch is set the system
just has to have a unique "filesystem number" identifier which is shared
by every watch request against the f/s.
I haven't looked at how the original proposal handles things like the same
f/s mounted multiple times, etc, so I wouldn't venture to improve on it.
If I were actually going to write something like this, I'd want to start
with a description of functional requirements and response time, and go
from there, trying to move as much as possible out of unpageable memory.
