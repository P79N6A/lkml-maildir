I've already asked Randy Hwron(sp?) to include this in
his regular benchmarking.

The thing is that developers need some benchmarking thing
they can script to run overnight.  Watching vmstat for
hours on end is not a useful way of spending development
time.
On the other hand, if somebody could code up some scriptable
benchmarks that approximate real workloads better than the
current benchmarks do, I'd certainly appreciate it.
For web serving, for example, I wouldn't mind a benchmark that:
1) simulates a number of users, that:
    1a) load a page with 10 to 20 associated images
    1b) sleep for a random time between 3 and 60 seconds,
        "reading the page"
    1c) follow a link and grab another page with N images
2) varies the number of users from 1 to N
3) measures
    3a) the server's response time until it starts
        answering the request
    3b) the time it takes to download each full page
Then we can plot both kinds of response time against the number
of users and we have an idea of the web serving performance of
a particular system ... without focussing on, or even measuring,
the unrealistic "servers N pages per minute" number.
Volunteers ? ;)
kind regards,
Rik
