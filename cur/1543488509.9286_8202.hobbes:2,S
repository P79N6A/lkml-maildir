Yes, they do. Flags are stored in inode, indeed. I see your point. Hmm...
OK, I'll look at it. Right now it's done via ioctl and ioctl follows
links. Ideally that should be done via *chmod, but we are tied by POSIX
(AFAICS)... Are there any plans to extend mode_t to 32 bits? Possibly with
new syscalls... Aieee... Too many of them. And assumption that
applications set the high 16 bits to 0 is not based on anything. OTOH if
we set high 16 bits of umask to 1 for anything not posessing appropriate
capability we might get out with it. Hmm...
