Hi
I want to use the OCF OpenSwan KLIPS,
I can see that the openswan patch is very big,
What exactly does this patch support:
 Which encryption Alg does it support??
 Which Authentication Alg does it support??
 I saw that part of the patch is for the kernel and part for the user??
 Is there any readme describing this patch??
Is there any working going on, for porting the OCF to the kernel IPsec??
Regards
Ronen Shitrit

Hi all,
A new release of the ocf-linux package is up:
	
http://ocf-linux.sourceforge.net/
Mostly Openswan updates/cleanups and fixes in this release.
* Patch for the latest OpenSwan to utilise OCF for full IPSEC
  ESP and AH processing.
* Well tested on 2.4.31 and 2.6.14 with OpenSwan.
* Simple single patch to add OCF to 2.4 or 2.6 kernels.
* Fixed broken openssl speed test (Ronen Shitrit)
Cheers,
Davidm
