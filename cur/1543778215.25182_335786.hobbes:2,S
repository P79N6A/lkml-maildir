While I don't /know/ exactely what the proper fix is I'll venture a
guess based on the information in the text above : The driver probably
doesn't call pci_enable_device().
Quoting the message at bootup time "If this causes a device to stop
working, it is probably because the driver failed to call
pci_enable_device().".
Also, the Kernel Janitors TODO list
(
http://janitor.kernelnewbies.org/TODO
) has this to say about
pci_enable_device() :
  - ALL PCI drivers should call pci_enable_device --before-- reading
    pdev->irq or pdev->resource[].  irq and resource[] may not have correct
    values until after PCI hotplug setup occurs at pci_enable_device()
    time.  Many PCI drivers need to be evaluated and checked for this.
