Subject: Another kernel releated GPL ?

I make "modifications" to the kernel, then create a user land library to access
these "modifications". Obviously my kernel "modifications" are then GPL, but
what is the opinion of the kernel developers as far as the license of this
library? Does that user land library have to be GPL also?
Thanks
Mark
