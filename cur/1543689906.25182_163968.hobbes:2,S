So, you report "oids_in_use + 100M" as total and "100M" as free inodes 
on disk. Voila!
We're using a Unix operating system which has a bunch of standard 
interfaces. The fun about using those is that lots of stuff "just works"
even if it wasn't designed to do exactly what you are doing right
now. So even if "df" wasn't designed to work on NFS, it still works.
But now we're going to get a new "df" which grabs the sysfs info and
uses that. But it won't work on reiserfs5, as the interface changes
again.
