Many, many companies seem to find it logical.  If you want to squeeze
a version in between "1" and "2".
Further, other kernel hackers suggested the 2.4.20.N sequence,
I simply agreed with it.  So it's not only me who thinks this way :)

Human nature says that will drag out the -pre tree ad infinitum.
Suppose a 2.4.21 is released today, with 2.4.20 + bug fixes.  Now,
tomorrow, another "critical bug" comes out, and then the -pre tree
becomes 2.4.23-pre.  Add another critical bug, and I hope you see
the continual delay of -pre happens here...
The basic logic is "do not disrupt current plans.  Do something
_in addition to_ current plans."
