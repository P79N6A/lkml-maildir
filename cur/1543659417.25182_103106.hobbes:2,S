Well, forcing them to a larger alignment surely won't break anything, 
except for wasting 12 bytes on cris. But in general, you're right, not of 
all of this is trivial to share due to these small differences. In the 
cases where it's necessary, we could do something like
(for CRIS)
#define EXTABLE_ALIGN 4
(in generic code)
#ifndef EXTABLE_ALIGN
#define EXTABLE_ALIGN 16
#endif
Of course, one could also do EXTABLE(4) and EXTABLE(16), respectively, but 
I think it's less obvious to the occasional reader that these magic 
numbers are about alignment.

Yes, and that's why I think that separating out and sharing these bits is 
a very good idea. Actually, separating out the ksymtab etc code should be 
really easy, as opposed to other stuff where there's more substantial 
differences between the archs.
It'll be a rather long and tedious process to do this work, but I think 
it's worth it.
