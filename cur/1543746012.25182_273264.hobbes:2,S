Yes - thats what the "ruby" kernel patch is all about.  I have a computer
with two "workstations" at home.  Compared to two computers, it
saves space, power, parts,  and above all - administrative work.  Only one
machine to upgrade, secure, configure.

Sure - ruby gives you that.  X may need a patch in order to support
ctrl+F2... on the scond keyboard, as the second console uses vt numbers
from 17 to 32.

Yes, you can do that.   The limit seems to be how many monitors you can
connect - there seems to be no practical limit to how many USB keyboards
& mice you can use.  The lengt of wires might also be a problem
with more than four.
