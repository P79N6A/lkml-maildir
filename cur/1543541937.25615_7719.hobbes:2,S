Some access to documentation would indeed be interesting. Not least to
fix inconsistencies such as:
	if (eeprom[3] & 0x03)
		printk(KERN_INFO "  Receiver lock-up bug exists -- ...
.....
        sp->rx_bug = (eeprom[3] & 0x03) == 3 ? 0 : 1;
	if (sp->rx_bug)
		printk(KERN_INFO "  Receiver lock-up workaround activated.\n");
which can be somewhat confusing.
Cheers,
