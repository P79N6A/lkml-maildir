We are trying to get rid of dma-mapping.h, see the last change to the
file with commit 411f0f3edc141a582190d3605cadd1d993abb6df. I don't think
we should reintroduce dma related definition but split the async_tx in a
way that allows to compile it on an architecture with CONFIG_NO_DMA=y
(yes I know that is harder that to just add the dma stubs).
You've said that there is a software implementation if there is no dma
engine present. This software implementation should be independent of
dma-mapping.h. Without having looked at the code, isn't it possible to
isolate that software implementation into its own C file? That would be
the only one that gets compiled for s390.
