RPMS are nicely divided into (sub)packages, so you need CVS indtalled
only if you install git-cvs package, for example to interact with CVS.
git-core has minimal dependencies.
To compile git you truly don't need other software installed (1.5.0
for example does not require RCS anymore for RCS merge).
