Yeah, I wouldn't doubt it.  Probably the solution will be to convert tty_pushing
to an atomic_t.
Time for the famous linux-kernel mantra: please try this untested patch
This isn't a fix for the problem, but is just a quick hack to keep track of
where the last place ppp->tpkt to NULL, and then report this when we try
to free it.  As a bonus, it will probably prevent most of your ugly crashes...
the race is definately still there but at least its shorter.
Anyway, if the patch works you should get some lines logged in the format:
  ppp device ppp0: tpkt set to NULL at point N
where N is a number between 1 and 5.  When you see that message, report back
with what N was so we know for sure what we're racing against.
