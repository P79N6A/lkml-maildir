Indeed I'm not quite sure about all the vm thing. One needs wide spread &
long term experiences to make good judgements in this area. But for the sake
of better read-ahead, I feel obliged to propose some read-ahead friendly vm
changes, and hope someone to consider and improve it with the whole picture
in mind.
So it's perfectly ok for me to leave the vm patches out for more discussion.
