What is the current status of UML for 2.6? As usable as the 2.4 (barring
generic kernel issues) or is there areas still neeed to be looked into for
the UML port to 2.6?
Any news on the possibility of having more of UML merged into the 2.6 
tree? Would be a pity if the release contains a UML architecture which is 
not working well..
