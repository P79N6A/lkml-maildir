They're all part of the same thing, they're just cleanup.

Kernel threads don't make the transition, they're sitting there with a
fully loaded sleep_avg.  You stop on the way up, sure, but once there, a
long sleep doesn't truncate you.  Try it.

No, they won't.  Furthermore, any kernel thread which cannot tolerate
dynamic priority semantics should not use them, they should be RT.

This barrier is artificial, and has been demonstrated to be harmful to
some loads.  Being practical, if this is demonstrated to still cause
trouble, I'll happily re-introduce it with a follow-up patch.

Quite the opposite, it makes perfect sense.  Taking the long sleeper to
the artificial barrier of prio 16 as stock does is the very reason that
thud totally destroys the interactive experience.  I'd love to remove
this barrier too, and have 'purity', but OTOH, the interactive border
_is_ a transition point where the scheduler changes behavior.  This is a
transition point in fact, so treating it as such is indeed correct.
