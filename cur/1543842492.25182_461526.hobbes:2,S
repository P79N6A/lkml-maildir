I second Jim's suggestion. Given the name of the other Winbond watchdog
drivers:
char/watchdog/w83627hf_wdt.c 
char/watchdog/w83977f_wdt.c
char/watchdog/w83877f_wdt.c
I'd suggest w83697hf_wdt.c. The W83697HG if the lead-free version of
the older W83697HF and they are otherwise the same chip. BTW I see that
there's already a driver for the W83627HF watchdog. Given the
similarities between the W83627HF and the W83697HF, it might make sense
to add support for the latter directly in the w83627hf_wdt driver,
rather than writing a brand new one.
