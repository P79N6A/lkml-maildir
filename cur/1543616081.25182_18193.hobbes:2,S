OK, are we agreed that:
  - We're waiting for Al to merge ext/*alloc.c changes
  - When that's done we will apply what would be my unbork patches (2: ext2_i) and
    (3: ext2_sb) to both 2.4.current and 2.5.current?  Subject to getting these two
    patches into the form everybody likes, of course.
  - We have some time in the interim to figure out how best to unbork fs.h, but we
    all agree it needs to be done soon.
