In 2.4, yes.  Coincidentally, Mikael Starvik reported this just a
couple of weeks ago, though it has been lurking there for a long time.
In 2.5 it was fixed (in ignorance of the problem) a little while ago,
and Marcelo already has fix below in his BK tree towards 2.4.20-pre3.
Anyway, thanks a lot for making sure we know about it.  (The code was
_nearly_ right, the loop should have terminated when nr returned from
file_read_actor becomes 0: but there were _two_ declarations of nr,
and the nr tested to terminate the loop remained 1 throughout).
