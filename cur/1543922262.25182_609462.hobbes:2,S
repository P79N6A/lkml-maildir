Perhaps the result of wishful thinking on my part.  I was hoping for a 
small and self-contained change.

Agreed.
I wonder how one could construct a series of mixed case time stamp 
comparisons *on purpose* (and without documentation of this assumption) 
that produces consistently correct results.
 From the invocations of get_seconds() that I sampled, the design of 
these comparisons seems to assume that both sides of the comparison are 
non-negative.  However, they do not seem to account for time crossing zero.
