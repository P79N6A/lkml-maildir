Why not?  In the former the module is still in use, in the latter the
module_exit routine is expected to clean up.

[Snip poor man's two-stage module delete patch].
We've been here lots of times before.  Most people want "remove or fail"
semantics for module removal.  Two-stage delete doesn't do this, but
instead leaves modules in a "half-removed" state, where the module
cannot be used, but usually a replacement module cannot be loaded
either.  This is what "rmmod --wait" does: close off module use to
future users (ie. try_module_get() will fail) and wait for the refcnt to
hit 0.
This option has not proven popular.
Rusty.
