Yes, it doesn't even have to be malicious. Consider the following
example:
An admin sets up an ftp-server with write access, running as root. He
chroots it and even creates AppArmor policy for it. However, he's a bit
sloppy and configures AppArmor so that the ftpd has write access to
everything in the chroot (even the stuff in bin/). The system is still
save, however, since the ftpd can't access anything outside of his
chroot.
Later, the admin decides to save space, deletes the bin/ directory and
instead links /bin/ls into the chroot. Suddenly the system is easily
exploitable.
I think that's what people mean when they say "impossible to analyze".
You have to look at the complete filesystem state to make sure you
didn't accidently compromise the whole system.
