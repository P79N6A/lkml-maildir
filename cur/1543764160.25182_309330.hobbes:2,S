Probably it's been like that for a long time, and nobody has
really bothered to change it.

Well the only patch that could possibly be considered would be a
straight search and replace, and absolutely no functional changes;
I think you would be up to it ;)
A few suggestions:
Don't use PF_*. That namespace is already being used by at least
process flags and protocol flags. Maybe page_locked, page_dirty,
etc. might be better
There could be a quite a bit of external code using these interfaces.
Typically we wouldn't just rename public interfaces in a stable
series "just because", but the rules are a bit different for 2.6.
Your best bet would be to firstly do a patch to create the new interface
names but keep the old ones in place for backwards compatibility (just
#defined to the new name), then a second patch to convert over all the
in-kernel users. The compatibility stuff can be removed in N years.
Lastly, it is quite likely that many people will consider this to be
more trouble than it's worth. So keep in mind it is not guaranteed to
get included.
