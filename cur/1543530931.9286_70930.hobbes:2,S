It could be if it weren't so "buggy".

And yet - the major competetor is doing (or trying to) do that - controling
missiles on a cruser, controling the cruser...
Are you now saying Linux is less reliable than NT?

Normal DESKTOP. Not a normal server.

It could be. I want it able to:
   1. perform in a server environment with 50-100  concurrent users.
   2. perform in high avilabilty environment with 50-100 users (disk servers)
   3. perform in a high security environment (banks, hospitals, and E-commerce)
   4. perform in high reliability environments (printers, scanners, specialized
		controllers)
I have 4 linux server/workstations that control a ~$500M (US) computer center.
I would like to continue to do so because it is simpler to manage (even without
resource controls). I do get periodic questions about why it "just rebooted
itself".
It is just as usable now as NT. Its' basic design is more (IMHO) reliable.
It lacks resource accounting, and high security support.
It is already getting high level security developement. It has been given
some resource accounting (IP level, and disk quotas). It is now time to
add memory and cpu accounting with resource control.

I think it could be a better choice than the current alternative...
