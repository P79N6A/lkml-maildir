I'm actually starting to think that some accounting memory usage *only*
in the slab, plus a few other structures for any stragglers not using
the slab would suffice.  Since the slab knows the size of the objects,
there is no ambiguity about how many are being used.  It should also be
a pretty generic way to control individual object types, if anyone else
should ever need it.
The high level pages-used-per-container metric is really nice for just
that, containers.  But, I wonder if other users would find it useful if
there were more precise ways of controlling individual object usage.
