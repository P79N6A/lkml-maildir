Applied with minor cosmetic changes. I'm like a dog who likes to pee on 
things to show his territory, so I changed "get_val_no_fault" to 
"get_futex_value_locked", and I made sure that the return value is 
sensible (return 0 or -EFAULT rather than the "__memcpy_from_user()" 
return value which is how many bytes we couldn't copy).
Not that we care (we just check the return value against zero anyway,
which is success in both cases), but the compiler should be able to
optimize it away, and it might avoid some confusion down the line..
