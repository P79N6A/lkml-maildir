I've been trying to configure two Intel Ethernet Pro 10/100's (the
newest cards, that are PCI and completely rectangular) in my Dell P200
with a Matrox Millenium card in it.
They both register on IRQ 11, and the kernel correctly determines their
MAC address and any other information about them.
The system works properly until I try to intialize both cards at once. 
Either of them will work if I down the interface with ifconfig before
trying to initialize the other.
This happens with an SMP kernel, with UP, with modules, or without using
modules.  I managed to get it working at one point, but I changed
something in the kernel (to enable bridging, and some other things, I
forgot what), and it stopped working again. 
Does anyone have any experiences with this, tips, etc?
I'm going to shoot myself if this has already been known, or if it is
due to some sort of configuration problem on my end. 
From what I see, I've tried everything.
Ben
