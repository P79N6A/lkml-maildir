I hit this too -- it seems that commit 8ffbc655 ("V4L/DVB (6451):
v4l2: add support for bus-based I2C drivers"), which added
v4l2_i2c_attach() without adding any dependency on CONFIG_I2C.  Not
sure what the correct fix is -- either CONFIG_VIDEO_DEV needs to
select/depend on CONFIG_I2C, or v4l2_i2c_attach() should only be built
if CONFIG_I2C is on.
