But this won't catch FSB overclocking at all (which nowadays seems the
most common way of oc-ing, since it does not involve any modifications
to the CPU other than maybe a better cooler). Or am I missing something?
And what exactly does the multiplier reading alone buy us? (No offense
meant - I am just curious because I really liked the feature, did not
even know that it was possible, and am a bit sad to see it go again)
