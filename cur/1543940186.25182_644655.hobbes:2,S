This conflicts with the SH updates (sh is also integrating 32/64-bit into 
one tree now).
Since I don't know the SH tree or your changes, the probably fairly 
trivial manual merge isn't an option (especially as I'm not at home and 
doing this on a laptop with a less than ideal keyboard and smaller screen 
than I'm used to).
So I hope you and Paul can resolve the conflicts and re-send.
