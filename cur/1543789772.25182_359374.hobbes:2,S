        It is not mandatory, it's just easier in this specific case.
If we knew for sure what the firmware contains, the box would be
enough.  But if someone is able to figure out exactly what the
firmware contains she/he will also be able to extract a tarball in
which case the box itself becomes useless to ask for the corresponding
sources ;-)
