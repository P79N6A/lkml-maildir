In the embedded space being able to chop stuff out makes a lot of sense.
It also encourages people to get modularity right. These are the same
people who already turn SYS5 IPC off as well, as as for glibc, well its
cute but its frequently bigger than the entire flash of the device.
There are arguments in some cases for avoiding the selections (notably
adding a zillion ifdefs to remove something thats utterly trivial) but
providing most users see only
	Remove kernel features for embedded systems (Y/N)
its no more dangerous/hassle than the kernel debug menu
