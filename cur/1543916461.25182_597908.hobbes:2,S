This is a good project for somebody who knows how SAS behaves on the 
wire, which is a rather limited group.
I'm willing to help anyone who proactively moves in this direction, but 
they need to be proactive about it...  I am the person who will have to 
make introductions at Broadcom, and convince Broadcom that new Person is 
a highly capable SAS software engineer.
Telling bcm "I don't know this guy, its doubtful he knows SAS, but we 
want to make him the primary engineer anyway" is not a very winning tale :)

That's the way it's looking.  There are a few avenues for exposing 
IDENTIFY and OPEN frames and related details, but no obvious "any frame, 
no problem" method like with the Marvell chip.
IMO it's also indicative that Marvell's chip uses a single set of 
command and response queues, whereas Broadcom has command/response 
queues for each "port" (bcm's term).
