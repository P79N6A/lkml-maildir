Eeeek.  Extra three secs doesn't sound too hot.  :-(

Just commenting out sd_resume() would be a better solution for your
case tho.

After receiving a command which requires media access, they do.  What
I was saying is that the current default behavior is to spin up all
devices on resume and part of that is achieved by sd_resume().
Hmmm... skipping START_STOP during sd_resume() actually is a pretty
good solution for ATA devices.  I'll think about it.
Thanks.
