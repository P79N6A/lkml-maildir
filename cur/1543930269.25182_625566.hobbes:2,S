Fake NUMA has always been useful for testing NUMA code without having to 
have a wide range of hardware available to you.  It's a clever tool on 
x86_64 intended for kernel developers that simply makes it easier to test 
code and adds an increased level of robustness to the kernel.  I think 
it's a valuable addition.
