but if the GPL doesn't control the BIOS how in the world are you saying 
that the fact that the GPL covers the kernel makes what the BIOS does 
wrong (even if the kernel was covered by GPLv3)?

I disagree. it's very relevant if your argument is that becouse the 
checksum if a checksum of the kernel that the license for the kernel 
somehow controlls what can be done with it.

you are arguing that the fact that later models are more locked down is 
'proof' that tivo knows that it's doing the wrong thing. I'm pointing out 
an alternate reason, the people who control the networks that the newer 
models are connecting to are imposing additional restrictions on tivo that 
cause them to need to be locked down more.
