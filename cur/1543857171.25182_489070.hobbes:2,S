I.e. a quick hack which has never been used by any distribution.
And anyway some kernel component is supposed to provide the aliases
pointing from the $MODALIAS values to the drivers, so modprobe $MODALIAS
would still work.

Can you mention some?

I am asking what is the point for a module to provide its own name in
$MODALIAS. You say that not doing this would break your custom hotplug
subsystem, but you still have not explained how this would happen since
$MODALIAS is available only *after* the module has been loaded by
something else.

Who cares? It does now, and for many good reasons.
