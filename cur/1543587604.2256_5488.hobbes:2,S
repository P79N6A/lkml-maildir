I have been unable to set up a module for my DPT fibrechannel host adapter, partly through unavailability, and partly through inexperience.
Found Ricky Beam's 2.4.0-test7 .diff, but lack the experience to retrofit it to 2.4.2. Tried  patch -su <dpt_i2o-test7.diff  to my kernel 2.4.2 source, but many errors not surprisingly.  Tried hand-modifying the files it changes and creating the .c & .h files, but failed there too.
What he made is (an apparently) unified .diff file for an older version of the kernel,
and I would like to get my fibrechannel working as (at least) a module in 2.4.2 and later if possible.
