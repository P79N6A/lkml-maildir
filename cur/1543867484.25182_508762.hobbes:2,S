to stress it: never does any mlocking or other lockdown happen of any 
syslet atom - it is /only/ the completion ring of syslet pointers that i 
made mlocked - but even that can be made generic memory no problem.
It's all about asynchronous system calls, and if you want you can have a 
terabyte of syslets in user memory, half of it swapped out. They have 
absolutely zero kernel context attached to them in the 'cached case' (be 
that locked memory or some other kernel resource).
