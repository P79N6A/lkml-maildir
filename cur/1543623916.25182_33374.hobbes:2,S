Hi,
I opened kernel source rpm and saw about 300 patch files
there. I want to know what each patch files does to linux
kernel. 
I tried to figure out by changelog but it is terrible for me.
I want to know info of patch files especially about VM and
swap which I heard issued to recenlt kernel.
Sorry for short English but any replying and comments will
be very helpful for me. Thank you.
