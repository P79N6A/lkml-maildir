Actually, you seemed to be considering it quite seriously a few months 
back. I spent a week cleaning it up at your request, but then I think the 
mail containing the patch was sent at about the same time as you sent the 
mail announcing the feature freeze. As I knew the feature freeze was 
coming, I was quite rushed, so I didn't clean it up as much as perhaps I 
should have done. 
There are still good reasons for including it. The PA-RISC people want HPUX 
emulation, which shares a lot of code with the other *NIX emulations. 
I was intending to dust it off and spend a little more time cleaning it up 
properly when you started taking patches for 2.5.
I'd actually quite like to see support for older Linux personalities
also being shifted into a configurable module along with the other
emulations - there's a lot of cruft that you can safely eliminate on an
embedded system where you _know_ they're never going to be running libc5
binaries.
