Thats almost certainly indicating that the memory type range registers
were not set up correcly by the BIOS. Check /proc/mtrr and also ask your
vendor about BIOS updates to address the problem
(If there aren't any you can hack around it but its not nice to let vendors
 get away with bugs if that indeed is what it is)
