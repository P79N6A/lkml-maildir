I am not an expert, but if you are refering to the 2.2.14-5.0 kernel
shipped with Red Hat 6.2, the PIII serial number shutoff code tries to
execute on my Thunderbird class Athlon processor (MSI-6330 motherboard)
and panics the kernel at boot time. I for one am glad that patch was
removed for 2.2.16-3.
