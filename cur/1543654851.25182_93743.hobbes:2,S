Well maybe that's what we should do - use the UnitedLinux ACPI patch (which
iirc is based on fairly recent ACPI code, and presumably minimizes
ACPI-related breakage) and then proceed incrementally from there?
Sound OK? Marcelo? UL folks?

PS probably involve some work breaking out the ACPI stuff from the UL patch
as a whole, or maybe (???) the UL people already have it broken out?
