This is the kind of problem that is screaming "give me dedicated 
hardware!". Why would one spend $500+ on a PC to do the work of a $2 
microcontroller (and possibly throw in an FPGA to the mix)?. Not to 
mention that the microcontroller/FPGA would maintain 50us +/- 0us 
instead of the 50 +/- 5 you've mentioned.
The same goes for the "hand under the saw". A simple 
transistor/triac/whatever and a logic circuit would stop the saw, we 
don't need any real time OS for that (and I would certainly trust the 
logic circuit more than any real time OS :).
IMHO, the kind of problems where real time OS's are useful are the kind 
that require computational power while having real-time constraints. 
Like the sound effects processor for the guitar that Lee Revell already 
mentioned or controlling an airplane in flight that has to measure a lot 
of sensors, do some state space calculations with some not-so-small 
matrices (together with Kalman filtering, etc.) and move the actuators.
