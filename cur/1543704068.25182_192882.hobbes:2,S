for personal email it is plain asocial. it tells me that
a person does not want to receive mail from me.
for ML i would propably accept a confirmation email
(similar to the gmame news server confirmations I have
to send if I want to post a message).
if you have a well working ML, I'm sure you can find some
person that will receive outside postings and click on
"delete" or "post" to confirm them. moderating outside
postings is ok IMO. but make sure that person does not
drop dead or is on a long vacation.
