Gerhard Fuellgrabe sent me the strace output of this, and it seems to be a
pipe problem, and nothing to do with parport or the printer driver.  Here
is the interesting bit:
[pid   382] mremap(0x400bb000, 0x51000, 0x51000, 0x1, 0x51000) = 1074507776
[pid   382] read(3, "", 4096)           = 0
[pid   382] close(3)                    = 0
[pid   382] munmap(0x400ba000, 4096)    = 0
[pid   382] fstat(0, {st_mode=0, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
[pid   382] fstat(1, {st_mode=0, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
[pid   382] mmap(0, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x400ba000
[pid   382] read(0, "%!PS-Adobe-3.0\n%%BoundingBox: 5"..., 8192) = 4096
[pid   381] <... write resumed> )       = 4096
[pid   381] write(1, "s they were one single machine.)"..., 4096 <unfinished ...>
[pid   382] write(1, "standard input:              Pos"..., 78) = 78
[pid   383] <... read resumed> "standard input:              Pos"..., 8192) = 78
[pid   383] fstat(1, {st_mode=S_ISUID|0367, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
[pid   383] mmap(0, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x400ba000
[pid   383] read(0,  <unfinished ...>
[pid   382] munmap(0x400ba000, 4096)    = 0
[pid   382] _exit(0)                    = ?
[pid   381] <... write resumed> )       = -1 EPIPE (Broken pipe)
[pid   381] --- SIGPIPE (Broken pipe) ---
[pid   381] write(2, "grep: writing output: Broken pip"..., 34) = 34
The processes here are:
381	grep -Ev ^$
382	file -
383	tr A-Z a-z
(from a shell script).  Can anyone make any sense out of this?  My best
guess was that someone has done a vfork and then messed with file
descriptors.
Tim.
