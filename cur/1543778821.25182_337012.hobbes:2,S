As others have mentioned there shouldn't be a UTF8 problem with isspace().
However, even if you wanted to scan going forwards you can do it without
the complexity of a nested loop:
	char *real_end;
	for (real_end = x; x - buffer->page < count; x++)
		if (!isspace(*x))
			real_end = x + 1;
	*real_end = '\0';
	// then fix "count"
BTW, my code I posted yesterday is incomplete since I neglected to notice
that the "count = z - x" at the end is used to repair "count" damage from
both the leading and trailing whitespace stripping.  Its actually easier
to strip the trailing whitespace first, like:
	while (count > 0 && isspace(buffer->page[count - 1]))
		count--;	/* strip trailing whitespace */
	if (count > 0 && isspace(buffer->page[0])) {
		/*
		 * We have leading whitespace but also at least one
		 * non-whitespace character
		 */
		const char *x = buffer->page;
		do {
			x++;
			count--;
		} while (isspace(*x));
		memmove(buffer->page, x, count);
	}
	buffer->page[count] = '\0';
