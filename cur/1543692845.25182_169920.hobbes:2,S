Hi!
I was seeing strange oopsen after saving image. They are almost
harmless: anything that happens after writing final signature does not
matter (as long as  it does not write to disk). But that oops makes
testing hard as you have to manually powerdown the machine.
free_page() at this point is unneccessary as machine is going down,
anyway. Please apply,
								Pavel
PS: For a test, I'm running while true; do echo 4 > /proc/acpi/sleep;
sleep 30; done while making kernel. It seems to work so far.
