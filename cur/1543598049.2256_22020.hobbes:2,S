mmap(0x04d5a000, PAGE_SIZE, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC, MAP_FIXED, fd,
           ^^^^ page boundary
0);
'MAP_FIXED' is your friend. This will take the offending page size 
(0x1000) on x86, out of use and give it to you. 'fd' is initialized
by opening /dev/mem.

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
