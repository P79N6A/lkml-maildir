  This piece of code is there just because we avoid page cache when
doing quota writes. That is a different story and should cause problems
with your lock checker.
  Standard way of running quota is:
- get i_mutex for data_inode
- write some data to data_inode
  - requires allocation -> calls DQUOT_ALLOC_SPACE
  - DQUOT_ALLOC_SPACE acquires some quota locks, decides it wants to
    write out quota structure (e.g. because we are journaling quota and
    must preserve quota integrity)
    - acquires dqio_sem, calls filesystem specific quota writing
      function - e.g. ext3_quota_write()
    - this function acquires i_mutex for quota file
I think this is the type of circle your checker has found.
