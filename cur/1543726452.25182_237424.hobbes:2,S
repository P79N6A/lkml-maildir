I posted a umsdos patch (to build on 2.6.0-test) last October/2003.
See http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-fsdevel&m=106697862024272&w=2
and see Al Viro's reply to that.
Anyway, I just updated my patch to build on 2.6.8-rc2-bk8, so my patch
is quite similar to yours now.  Yours is a small bit ahead of mine.
