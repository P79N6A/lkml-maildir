i could use my device in X without evtouch.o or any X-module or any
xorg.conf modified, but wrong positions to cursor.
and consider using touchscreens in console(framebuffer) mode, or
without evtouch in X, or devices do not provide several functions.
suppose we can something in /etc/rc.d/rc.local or some files:
/sbin/modprobe usbtouchscreen swap_xy=1,min_x=123,max_y=456,....
we don't need any calibrate tool or guest several functions from
devices, and complete this module.
Anyway, just some suggestions. thx :)
