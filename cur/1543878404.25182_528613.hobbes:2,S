No.  It does not need such a test, as it requires BMDMA, not just an 
SFF-style Status register.  It is up to the driver to decide whether or 
not ata_irq_ack() is appropriate for your hardware.
pata_icside needs its own ata_irq_ack -- which may just be as simple as 
reading the Status register to clear the interrupt condition.
If others need this as well, ata_sff_irq_ack() would be a good generic 
function to create.
