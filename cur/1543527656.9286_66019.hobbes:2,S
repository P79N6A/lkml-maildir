I've noticed sometimes that processes near the start of my init scripts
tend to fail whereas if I put them near the end of my init scripts, they
run just fine. Is anyone else experiencing this odd behaviour?
Strangely, it happens to ntpd more than anything else, though depmod has
also not run at least once.
