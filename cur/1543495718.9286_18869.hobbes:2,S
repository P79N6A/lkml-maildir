	My apologies for not producing as detailed a report as Michael,
but I'd like to add a "me too", for what it's worth.  I had been working
with an unpatched 2.2.8 for about 5 hours when I noticed I couldn't make
ssh connections from an Eterm anymore.  ssh -v showed:
...
sparrow.websense.net: Host 'remotemachine' is known and matches the host key.
sparrow.websense.net: Initializing random; seed file /home/wstearns/.ssh/random_seed
[This was the last line printed]
[Normally, the process would go on to print:]
sparrow.websense.net: IDEA not supported, using 3des instead.
...
	When I went back to some other Eterminals, I noticed that one of
my pine sessions, which, like Michael's, was in the process of resyncing
with disk, had stopped responding to anything and had stopped syncing
partway through. It wouldn't respond to a HUP.  Other terminals allowed me
to press Ctrl-D or type exit and bash would gladly start to shutdown, but
the Eterm wouldn't ever close.  It cleared out the characters from the
bash session then stayed there with a black interior.  An enlightenment
right click on the "x" button (the equivalent of kill -9, probably) was
required to close the windows.
	Ctrl-alt-backspace shut most of X down, but I never successfully
got back to a text console.  Ctrl-alt-del failed to reboot; I had to use
alt-sysrq-s/u/b, which brought me back up into an e2fsck that just had a
small amount of cleanup to do.
