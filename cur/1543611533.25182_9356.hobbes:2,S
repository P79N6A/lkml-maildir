Um, staying as far away from that bit of source as possible, I will
offer:
It depends on how it is referenced.  If it is just a counter, you may be
able to just make it atomic.  If it needs to "stick" for a little
longer, then consider if there are many readers and only a few writers,
in which case look at the read/write_lockirq code, however, this does
have the down side of irq off.  BKL did not protect against interrupts,
so one wonders if the irq bit is needed at all.
