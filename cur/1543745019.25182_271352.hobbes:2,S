#   x86_64: Don't wait on panic
# 
After this change asynchronous IPIs are unusable, as 'data' is local
variable for __smp_call_function, but __smp_call_function does not
wait anymore for other processor(s) to fetch this data.
Due to this smp_call_function_interrupt in better case just modifies
random memory in atomic_inc(&call_data->started), in worse case (as
happened to me) 'data' on stack is overwritten with other data and
bogus function is called, triggering some fault in IPI interrupt and
killing whole system.
If you cannot guarantee that other processor will accept IPI,
I'm afraid that you'll have to create much more complicated change
than simple change you did in the change above.
Due to this change you cannot run VMware on these kernels, as sooner
or later kernel will die as vmmon is big source of async IPIs.
It would be nice if you could insmod attached 'rhtest' module to check
your eventual fix (it was originally written to prove that RHAS2.1 
kernels are broken when it comes to async IPI, but it works nice for 
this case too).  It should print:
Test done. ASYNC was ASYNC, SYNC was SYNC, nesting did not happen.
Test passed.
and not:
Test done. ASYNC was ASYNC, SYNC was SYNC, nesting occured.
Test failed.
ASYNC IPI was completely lost!
