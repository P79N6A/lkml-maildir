That is completely false.
I have a 2.2 kernel set up, with IDE support built in, and
ide-scsi and ide-cd as modules.
My IDE hard disks use the IDE driver built in, my ATAPI CD writer
gets the ide-scsi module, and my ATAPI CDROM gets the ide-cd
module.  All of them function properly as well.
You need to add "hdc=ide-scsi" "hdd=ide-cd" to your lilo config
so the kernel knows which driver to associate with which drive.
