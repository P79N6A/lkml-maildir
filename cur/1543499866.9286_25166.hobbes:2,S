I generally cut out all the flak, usually w/make mrproper, in between
kernel compiles.  I had *thought* the only thing I needed to do was to
restore the asm link.  If people are going to be compiling stuff against
Linux header files, perhaps we should consider actually *leaving* them
in there when the kernel tree is cleaned (e.g., with mrproper), and for
a really pristine tree, move those deletions to distclean or something
similar.
Of course, once you actually *know* about these things, it's a small
matter to fix it.  But going through the failed compiles, wondering what
the heck happened to your kernel tree, sure is irritating.
