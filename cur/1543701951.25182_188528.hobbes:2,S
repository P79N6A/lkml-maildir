I suspend by "apm -s". I disabled Suspending by closing the lid or by
Fn+F4 because it happens when I don't like it then, which can be fatal
when resume does not work.
My "test scenario" is doing an "apm -s" when booted with
"init=/bin/bash", having done nothing else than mounted /proc.
tried that with -test4 to -test11, final, and -mm1. All without success.
I can move the point where it crashes around (when I have yenta support
in, it crashes before displaying the prompt again, without it crashes
after displaying it (however, further commands i append by ";" to the
apm command are not executed or only print their first line of output;
so it is most likely not the keyboard driver which is broken). With
local apic it crashes before it suspends. I hoped this would help you to
track down the bug, but it seems that all this behaviour is normal (with
apic), except that without apic it should work...

I'd like it if you could make my laptop suspend again *without* local
apic. (or better, resume). It works on 2.6.0-test3, whatever i do, but i
don't manage to get it working on later kernels.
And I do *not* like to run beta kernels on production machines, you
mightt understand that...
Till 2.4.x, i believed that the apm of my notebook cannot be made
working with linux - but -test1 to -test3 (I did not try any 2.5
kernels) showed me that it is possible to resume it. Just that it seems
to be impossible with a "stable" kernel. (is that Murphy?)
