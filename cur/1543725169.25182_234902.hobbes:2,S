The NUMA issue is the only caveat I saw. I guess I just wanted to
mention it by name.

The only methods I can think of to repair this (basically queueing) are
not busywait-free.

I suppose it's worth refining the starvation claim to delaying freeing
memory as opposed to readers causing writers to busywait indefinitely.

Well, neither do I. =)
