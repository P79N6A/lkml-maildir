Stupid questions:
- Why do we still have a linux/config.h if it is totally redundant.
- Why don't we have at least a #warning in linux/config.h that would
  tell us not to include it.
- Why do we still have about 200 includes of linux/config.h in the
  kernel tree?
I would much rather have a compile error, or at least a compile
warning rather than needed a code review to notice this error.
We haven't needed this header since october of last year.
