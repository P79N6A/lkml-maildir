If the user unmaps the page, then aio is left holding the last reference 
to the page and will unmap it from irq or bh context (potentially task 
context too).  With networked aio, pages from userspace (anonymous or 
page cache pages) will be released by the network stack from bh context.  
Even now, I'm guess that should be possible with the zero copy flag...
