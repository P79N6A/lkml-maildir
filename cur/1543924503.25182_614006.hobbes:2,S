And in general the pciutils-dev package should be installed.

As does my card:
# lspci |grep 1394
00:09.0 FireWire (IEEE 1394): VIA Technologies, Inc. IEEE 1394 Host
Controller (rev 46)
root@andi:/tmp# ./vt6307ohciver 00:09.0
I/O region #1 is at A000
It seems your VT6307 chip is connected to 93c46 EEPROM
Page size is 4096 (0x1000) bytes
GUID PROM register address is 0xdb140004
Mapping 8 (0x8) bytes of memory at 0xdb140000
Mapped mem region #0 at virtual address 0xb7ee5000
GUID PROM register is at virtual address 0xb7ee5004
EEPROM dump:
00: 00 11 06 66 45 55 56 E1 04 04 32 55 F8 00 A2 02
10: A1 00 40 63 06 11 44 30 03 DF 40 80 00 20 00 73
20: 3C 10 00 00 00 00 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
Your VT6307 chip is in OHCI 1.0 mode
And viewing from a quite problematic angle (card is in running PC,
difficult to view) strongly seems to indicate a VT630_6_ (the "6" is
quite clearly visible).
This means that I currently cannot offer any mfct. date data however,
unfortunately.
