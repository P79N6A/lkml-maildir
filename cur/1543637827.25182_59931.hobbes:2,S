I believed so too, but Lei-Chun patch changed it to ATA133.
Lei-Chun, could you tell us what we can expect from 745 chips ?

I don't see why (unless you refer to the 962/963 problem I did mention).
If we remove the IDs, the chips will be detected as SiS5513 (ATA_16). If
I'm correct, in this mode (only allowing PIO modes and SW/MW DMA modes)
all chips are OK.
I didn't dig in all specs to check each config register change, but all I
saw was OK and I *never* received any data corruption report for a chip that
was configured as original SiS5513 (though I have many reports of bad
performance due to PIO modes being used in such cases).
LB.
