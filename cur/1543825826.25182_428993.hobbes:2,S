Aha!  But perhaps this is too easy a data set.  HTTP clients typically
dynamically allocate port numbers within a range and source address
are typically not less than a certain value.  That is why I suggested
something like:
       sport = 10000;
       saddr = 0x0a000000;  /* 10.0.0.0 */
       ...
       if (++sport == 16000) {
	       sport = 10000;
	       saddr++;
       }
If this shows artifacts worse than XOR then more realistic gaps in the
input values will cause artifacts.

Adding primes.  Again, the arithmetic series of primes might auto-correlate
with the Jenkins function.  Or it plain might not like gaps.

Skip that then.
