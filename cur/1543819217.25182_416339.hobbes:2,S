Is there a way to find out bus speed for other slots/cards?

In general, yes, though I just had a lockup with this new MV card in my 
test system.  Otherwise, my X5DPL-TGM with on MV card in slot 4 and one 
Intel GigE in slot 5 has been quite stable.

I think it's only related to device/bus issues, not in general.
Thanks a lot for the reply.  I'll be trying to turn down the bus speed 
in the BIOS to see if that help.
