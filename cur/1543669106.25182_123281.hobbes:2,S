I ignore the flame bait in the hopes to get a reasonable answer this time, 
if you have a personal problem with me, you are free to tell me this 
directly, but flaming will help nobody.
The dynamic number discussion I remember were not only about numbering but 
also about naming. A specific device had to be addressable with a specific
number. We currently have a fixed mapping between numbers and names (as 
documented in devices.txt). Disks are an area where this doesn't work, the 
only exception is IDE, because most machines have a builtin controller, 
so it's easy to map to a fixed number. SCSI already has to use dynamic 
numbers, because it wouldn't otherwise fit into a 16bit dev_t and with SAN 
even 64bit will not be enough. This makes SCSI very annoying, when at the 
next boot everything has a new name, because a disk was added/removed.
Consequently it's impossible that the kernel guarantees a static name/ 
number for a specific device. devfs showed that the kernel is the wrong 
place for name policies. Is see no other possibility than to number 
devices dynamically and leave it to userspace to name them or did I miss 
an important point in previous discussions?
Maybe you could also answer me, what exactly you need a 64bit dev_t for?
If anything of this has been discussed previously, I'd also be happy about 
any URLs. Thanks.
bye, Roman
