I agree.
Just FYI, I have several bug fix patches for current memcg(that is for .29).
I've been testing them now, and it survives my test(rmdir aftre task move
under memory pressure and page migration) w/o big problem(except oom) for hours
in both use_hierarchy==0/1 case.

I think Paul's hierarchy_mutex patches fixed the dead lock, I haven't seen
the dead lock after the patch.
(Although, it may cause another dead lock when other subsystems are added.)
