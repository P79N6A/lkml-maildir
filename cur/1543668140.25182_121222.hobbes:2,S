    If you don't want to or can't answer my question, it means I can revert 
    your character device changes?
I am not Linus. You can send him whatever you think best
and see whether he applies it.
I would prefer if you waited a bit. This little detail,
changing the size of dev_t, requires an audit of the
kernel source. That takes some time.
I would much prefer postponing discussion about device
handling until after number handling is in good shape.
Generally it is a bad idea when two people simultaneously
change the same code.
