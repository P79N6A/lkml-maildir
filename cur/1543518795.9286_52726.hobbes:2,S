Yes, but as I said in my previous note: I think you should consider
using keycode instead of scancode. 
There are lots of advantages: No need to parse scancode sequences both in
the kernel and in your module. Added flexibility - if your module eats
certain keycodes then you can make any key act on that module by a
change in keymap. Added usability: others with a keyboard that produces
different scancodes can still use your module.
A cleaner kernel source: as soon as this hook is present we can throw out
all mention of SYSRQ from all kernel code, and have SYSRQ treatment
just as an example module that uses this hook.
