 This patch adds min and max fields of long type to struct
kernel_param and adds range checking for integer, charp and array
parameters.  Also, struct kparam_string isn't necessary anymore as we
can use max field instead.  I think this simple range-checking can
remove a lot of dulicated codes from drivers.
