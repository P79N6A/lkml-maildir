At least in the USA the patent requirements and royalties make it impractical
to do WAP clients. Apache can be told the wap mime types but remember if you
are operating the server in the USA you may need to pay about $10K/year to
run your server.
Either way WAP is user space so outside of the kernel issues. There are one
or two people working on simple WAP tools in europe, and its possible
that Mozilla will support WAP although I guess the patents killed that 
Freshmeat.net may be a better place to start looking.
