From 2.6.23's fs/ioctl.c - do_ioctl():
        if (filp->f_op->unlocked_ioctl) {
                error = filp->f_op->unlocked_ioctl(filp, cmd, arg);
                if (error == -ENOIOCTLCMD)
                        error = -EINVAL;
                goto out;
        } else if (filp->f_op->ioctl) {
                lock_kernel();
                error = filp->f_op->ioctl(filp->f_path.dentry->d_inode,
                                          filp, cmd, arg);
                unlock_kernel();
        }
As a sidenote, please don't use f_dentry and f_vfsmnt, since they are just 
#defines for the correct fields. They were meant to be temporary transition 
helpers, but (alas) have refused to die thus far. If noone beats me to it, 
I'll take a look-see at deprecating them all the way.
