SSIA -- I haven't seen this problem on any other hardware though, looks like 
Asus is doing something weird in its controller and -mm doesn't have a 
workaround.
The IDE controller appears to be a variant of a SiS 5513 (one oddity is the 
fact that there is no secondary controller). The harddisk is connected 
as /dev/hda, the DVD drive as /dev/hdb. Using a different DVD drive doesn't 
change anything.
Unless someone beats me to it, I'll diff -u the -ac8 and -mm2 IDE drivers to 
figure out what's going on when I have some time.
