Subject: "Untidy" output from df with virtual filesystems

This is probably more of a userland thing, but when I have extra fs's like
proc and shm mounted I get, what might be called, confusing output from
df.  Like this...
[lawrence@aslak lawrence]$ df -h
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/hda2             3.9G  2.6G  1.1G  70% /
none                  4.0T  4.0T     0 100% /proc
/dev/hda5             2.4G  1.8G  443M  81% /home
none                  4.0T  4.0T     0 100% /dev/pts
/var/shm              4.0G     0  4.0G   0% /var/shm
Does that really look right to give proc and so on "huge" Sizes?  I can
see size being valid for Shm (total shared memory maybe?) but anyway...
just thought someone might have some comments.  My df seems to be
version: df (GNU fileutils) 4.0.  There is a --all switch to df so it
shows 0 block file systems.  Which seems to say that proc etc should be
that type?
