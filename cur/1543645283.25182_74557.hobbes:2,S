It seems a bit odd to me that you /only/ split out task_struct but none
of the simple helpers (for_each_process(), task_lock,
set_task_state etc.). I'd prefer a task.h personally, many of these can
be placed without further burdening the include nest.
It'd certainly be nice to see sched.h properly cleaned up at some point
(request_irq() ??? d_path() ???)
