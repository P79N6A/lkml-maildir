Ok. I added padding before and after ptype_all.
With padding the problem no longer occurs.
However, if the padding is put before ptype_base and after ptype_all
then the problem occurs.
So it looks like this is due to writes intended for ptype_base going
out of bounds. However, there nothing in the code in net/core/dev.c
that would allow this to happen. Also why is the list head set
to 0x10:0x10?
