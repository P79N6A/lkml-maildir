Mmm. Though whether any one of us will personally use each feature
is perhaps not the most ideal criteria to judge things by ;-)

If it's really 1%, yes, that's a huge problem. And yes, I agree with
you that there's a problem with the rate of change. Part of that is
a lack of performance measurement and testing, and the quality sometimes
scares me (though the last month has actually been significantly better,
the tree mostly builds and boots now!). I've tried to do something on 
the testing front, but I'm acutely aware it's not sufficient by any means.

Sounds worth discussing. We need *some* way of dealing with fragmentation
issues. To me that means both an avoidance strategy, and an ability
to actively defragment if we need it. Linux is evolved software, it
may not be perfect at first - that's the way we work, and it's served
us well up till now. To me, that's the biggest advantage we have over
the proprietary model.

It seems inevitable that we need both physically contiguous memory
sections, and virtually contiguous in kernel space (which equates to
the same thing, unless we totally break the 1-1 P-V mapping and
lose the large page mapping for kernel, which I'd hate to do.)

It's not just about memory hotplug. There are, as we have discussed
already, many usage for physically contiguous (and virtually contiguous)
memory segments. Focusing purely on any one of them will not solve the
issue at hand ...
