           Summary: oops in proc_kill_inodes when file rapidly added and
                    removed
    Kernel Version: 2.6.0-test9
            Status: NEW
          Severity: high
             Owner: bugme-janitors@lists.osdl.org
         Submitter: nathanl@austin.ibm.com

Rapidly adding and removing a file in /proc can result in an oops in
proc_kill_inodes, because the dentry in the following loop is sometimes NULL:
	list_for_each(p, &sb->s_files) {
		struct file * filp = list_entry(p, struct file, f_list);
		struct dentry * dentry = filp->f_dentry;
		struct inode * inode;
		struct file_operations *fops;
		if (dentry->d_op != &proc_dentry_operations)
			continue;
		inode = dentry->d_inode;
		if (PDE(inode) != de)
			continue;
		fops = filp->f_op;
		filp->f_op = NULL;
		fops_put(fops);
	}
I have a simple testcase module which I will attach that can be used to
reproduce the problem.  The module creates a /proc/stress directory and a
/proc/stress/ctl writable file.  When "add" is written to /proc/stress/ctl,
another file, /proc/stress/data, is created.  When "remove" is written to
/proc/stress/ctl, /proc/stress/data is removed.
The procedure for producing the oops:
1. Load the procstress.ko module.
2. Execute a loop in a shell:
   while true ; do
   echo add > /proc/stress/ctl
   echo remove > /proc/stress/ctl
   done
3. In another shell, execute another loop:
   while true ; do
   cat /proc/cpuinfo &>/dev/null
   done
Eventually, an oops similar to the following should occur (taken from a ppc64
system):

I have verified that the problem occurs on i386, too.
I realize that this is not a "real world" test of procfs, but there is some
ppc64 work in progress that can be made to exercise the system in the same way,
with the same results.  I wrote the procstress module in order to isolate the
problem.
