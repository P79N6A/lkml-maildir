First, this is not our problem.  The buffer we are working on holds 256
bytes, so this looks like a SEP.
Does the ramdisk work?  If so, it might just be a reporting issue.  If not,
main.c says something about a function call to process the "non-memory"
command line options.  I would look there.

# wc /proc/cmdline

auto BOOT_IMAGE=2333 ro root=803 console=ttyS1,9600 console=tty0

append="console=ttyS1,9600 console=tty0 ramdisk_start=0x1000

(obviously ramdisk_blabla is not a real parameter ;)
