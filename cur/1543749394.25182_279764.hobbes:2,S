bcopy(3) copies stuff inside a process. If the memory areas copied from/to
are available in RAM, the copy will go at full speed. If not, there will be
delays (due to paging, etc). Now, the system might be paging like mad, but
the memory _this_ process requires is available (== full speed bcopy), or
there might be almost no paging activity, but the pages required for the
copy aren't in RAM (== slowest possible).
PS: Consider using memcpy(3), bcopy is non-standard.
