   Everything worked fine with stock 2.2.7.
   Unfortunately enough time went by between my original message that I had
made other changes that may be afffecting things, rather than the change to
2.2.7. Without a lot of checking, I just don't know.
   If you would still like to know what the timing difference is for your
patch, I can run that tonight. I saved the time it took with 2.2.7. That's
about all the information I guess we'll get if I understood you correctly.
