Hmm, I have similar problems with my mouse since I'm using kernel 2.6.
Sometimes (once a day or only every second day) my mouse goes to the
left upper corner. But then works a normal. Extremly annoying while
playing UT2004.
But I don't get any kernel messages. With 2.4 everything worked fine.
(Currently using 2.6.8-rc2-mm1)
Regards,
Martin
