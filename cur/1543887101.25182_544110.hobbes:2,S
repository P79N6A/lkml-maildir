As the atkbd.c driver already had a work-around for exactly the same problem
with some (I think) Korean keyboards (KEY_HANGEUL and KEY_HANJA), adding
this infrastructure (well, one pointer and two ioctls) seemed a logical step.
If you prefer a hack just in atkbd.c and activate it on Dell laptops, I see
what I can do. The problem with that is that I don't know the scancodes of
all keys on all models (and future models) that exhibit this behaviour. I'll
implement what I know, though (it'll take some time because I'll be
travelling quite a lot very soon).
Greetings,
