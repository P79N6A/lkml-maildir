why not just make it not execute without any priviledges under older
kernels? The mechanizm could be this:
  - extra section holding priviledge data, only used by newer kernels
    [this is your solution], plus:
  - new kernel 'fakes' a setuid root bit, so these binaries can be easily
    identified even with old (priviledge-unaware) 'ls'. (The executable
    bit is not touched.)
  - under old kernels the binaries are still usable, but will have
    sufficient rights only if you run them as root. (perfectly OK for eg.
    disaster recovery and generic robustness) 
  - possible extra fcntl() for new kernels to further identify 'true'
    setuid root binaries, and 'faked' (ie. priviledge-enabled) setuid
    root binaries. new versions of 'ls' could use this fcntl(). (it's not
    a performance problems, the fcnt needs only be executed for setuid
    root binaries (both fake and real ones), which are rare)
  - 'fake' setuid root bits are _not_ exported through networked
    filesystems as a default. 
i believe this plan enables us to 'smoothly' move through the migration
phase, and doesnt shut the door on older kernels either. Also it enables
us to be aware of 'dangerous' executables, is secure (no normal user can
generate a secure binary just by creating ELF sections), and doesnt export
dangerous priviledges to networked systems automatically.
anything i've missed?
