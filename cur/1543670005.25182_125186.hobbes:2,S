Page clustering? I did a simple patch yesterday called "cow-ahead", which
may be related: on a write to a COW page, it breaks the COW from several pages
at the same time. The implementation survived a complete debian 2.2 boot
and a fork bomb. Please have a look. The idea came from a discussion with
Martin J. Bligh... we liked the name too much not to implement it.
Greets, Antonio.
