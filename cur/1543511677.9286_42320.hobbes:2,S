Yes, boot -r is pretty much the same as:
drvconfig
devlinks
disks
which is what I usually do when hot-configuring devices (disks in
particular) in Solaris.
From the respective man pages:
DESCRIPTION
     The default operation of drvconfig  is to create  the  /dev-
     ices  directory  tree  that  describes,  in  the  filesystem
     namespace, the hardware  layout  of  a  particular  machine.
     Hardware  devices  present  on the machine and powered on as
     well as pseudo-drivers are represented under /devices.  Nor-
     mally  this  command is run automatically after a new driver
     has been installed (with add_drv(1M))  and  the  system  has
     been rebooted.
DESCRIPTION
     devlinks  creates symbolic links  from  the  /dev  directory
     tree to the actual block- and character-special device nodes
     under the /devices directory tree.  The  links  are  created
     according  to  specifications  found  in  the table-file (by
     default /etc/devlink.tab).
     devlinks    is   called   each   time    the    system    is
     reconfiguration-booted,   and   can   only   be   run  after
     drvconfig(1M) is run, since drvconfig(1M) builds the  kernel
     data structures and the  /devices tree.
DESCRIPTION
     disks   creates  symbolic  links  in   the    /dev/dsk   and
     /dev/rdsk  directories  pointing  to  the actual disk device
     special files under the  /devices directory  tree.
