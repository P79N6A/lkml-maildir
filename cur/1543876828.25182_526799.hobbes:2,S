That's huge.

Huh. That's this:
struct module_ref
{
        local_t count;
} ____cacheline_aligned;
This is horrible. Surely there's some way to do better than a
cacheline per module per possible CPU. We should only need 4 bytes per
module per online CPU.
And really, about the only case where we actually care about cacheline
bouncing here at all is on modules that do this per-packet. Just about
everyone else can get by with 4 bytes per module total.
