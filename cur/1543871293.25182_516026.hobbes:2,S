You can start with 5 and increment by 5.  So you need not reboot each
time, compile tdfxfb as a module, and set CONFIG_HW_CONSOLE_BINDING=y
(under drivers->char). Make sure you have vbetool, and use the attached
script.  Thus:
modprobe tdfxfb
unbind.sh
rmmod tdfxfb
edit, make, make modules_install
modprobe tdfxfb
repeat
The script assumes vbetool is in /usr/sbin, if not just edit. Also,
unbinding will only work if X (or any graphics app, for that matter) is
not loaded.
