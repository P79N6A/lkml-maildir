The problem is I'm constantly getting these  X-order-allocation errors
in kernel log and after which system becomes unstable and often hangs
or leaves process which cannot be killed even by "-9" signal.
Installed debuggin patches produce the following allocation paths:

That's why I thought this problem is related to raid1 swapping I'm
using.
Well. Of couse I'm speaking about synced RAID1.
