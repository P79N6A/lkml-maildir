Hi Balbir,
I just saw Vatsa's comments.  We have similar limitation with the
current implementation also.  sched_domain_attr dattr is also per
partitioned domain and not per numa node.  
In the current implementation we can get rid of the per-cpu variables
and use root_domain.  Later we can have an array in root_domain and
index it based on the cpu's node.
Thanks,
