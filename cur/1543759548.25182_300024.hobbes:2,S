SuSE 9.2 on IBM ThinkPad X31 (2884-JUU), 2.6.11 kernel. Great having a
notebook where everything just works.
Bluetooth (hci_usb) works fine, but after suspend/resume cycle using
APM the BlueTooth interface dies (LED goes out) and I can't get it back
by unloading/reloading modules. However, if I compile the bluetooth and
hci_usb into the kernel rather than as modules, suspend resume seems to
work fine. (APM is configured to stop/start Bluetooth service around a
suspend/resume cycle).
Any idea why?
FWIW: I still use APM because ACPI suspend to RAM consumes 1250
mW/hour while APM suspend to RAM is only 360 mW/hour, not worth the
fancy features, but that is another topic. Windows XP ACPI suspend
to RAM consumes 525 mW/hour. 
Any suggestions on how to reduce power consumption when suspended
using ACPI?
