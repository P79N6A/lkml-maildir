Hi,
I'm porting the Linux IDE driver to my StrongARM board (so it's actually
the ARM IDE derivative), but I have some problems getting the thing going.
There is actually _something_ detected, because without IDE device, the
driver complains about not finding anything at all. If I use an IDE
device, the driver complains with:
  hda: probing with STATUS(0xa0) instead of ALTSTATUS(0x52)
  hda: probing with STATUS(0xa1) instead of ALTSTATUS(0x51)
  hda: no response (status = 0xa1), resetting drive
  hda: probing with STATUS(0x08) instead of ALTSTATUS(0xd0)
  hda: no response (status = 0xa1)
From the ATA-3 specs I figured out that this basically means that there
are a lot of errors, sto the amount that I begin to suspect that there is
something wrong with the interface itself (which is just a CPLD and some
line drivers).
My question is actually: what's the general idea behind the drive probes?
Write some magic values to the device and see if some other magic value
can be read back?
Erik
PS: Is there some newer ATA documentation, preferably in pdf? I only found
    a working draft of the ATA-3 specs in Word format (ouch!)
