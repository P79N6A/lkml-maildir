Is there any hope that piix4 mwdma now works again? I'm refering to this 
bug that appeared in 2.4.19:
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0210.3/1332.html
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0208.3/1128.html
If there is any hope, I will get a equivalnet computer to test (this 
spaecific computer is still in production use).
