hi,
gcc 4.1 with some extra warnings show the following:
drivers/scsi/ipr.c:6361: warning: comparison of unsigned expression < 0 is always false
drivers/scsi/ipr.c:6385: warning: comparison of unsigned expression < 0 is always false
drivers/scsi/ipr.c:6415: warning: comparison of unsigned expression < 0 is always false
The problem is that rc is of the type u32, which can never be smaller than zero,
therefore all three error handling checks get useless. This patch changes it to
a normal int, because all usages / all functions it get used with expect an int.
