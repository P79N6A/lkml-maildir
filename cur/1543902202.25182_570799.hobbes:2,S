It's selectively stopping kernel threads, which is just about right.  If you
that _this_ is a main problem with the freezer, then think again.

In fact, the main problem with the freezer is that it is a coarse-grained
solution.  Therefore, what I believe we should do is to evolve in the directoin
of more fine-grained solutions and gradually phase out the freezer.
The kexec-based approach is an attempt to replace one coarse-grained solution
(the freezer) with even more coarse-grained solution (stopping the entire
kernel with everything), which IMO doesn't address the main problem.
