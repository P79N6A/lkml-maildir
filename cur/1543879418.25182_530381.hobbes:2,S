a new server box. One card has been worked before in a test box,
it's sure, here is a dmesg snippet when everything was OK:

 Kernel version is vanilla 2.6.20.3, Sundance MMIO disabled in the config. I
can send lspci, full dmesg, .config if anyone interested in. Maybe it's a BIOS problem?
What should I try?
thanks,
