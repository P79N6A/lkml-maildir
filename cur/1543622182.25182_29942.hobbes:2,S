Is there any drawback to use this patch? :
In const char i82557_config_cmd[22] = {
-       0x68, 0, 0x40, 0xf2, 0xBD,              /* 0xBD->0xFD=Force
full-duplex */
+       0x68, 0, 0x40, 0xfa, 0xBD,              /* 0xBD->0xFD=Force
full-duplex */
I use the other 2 interfaces in normal mode and they are eepro100 too,
only one uses 2 tagged subinterfaces.
Btw, I was able to reconfigure the whole thing and it does work fine now,
but I can't really make a test now with the other two interfaces since I
did all this remotely.
