Hi Anton,
All of the code as below:
//==============================================
extern struct vm_struct *vmlist;
struct vm_struct *vmlist2,*L2vm;
int find_vm_struct(void *addr)
{
                struct vm_struct **p;
                int i;
                struct page *pg;
                printk("&vmlist=%x\n",&vmlist);
                for (p = &vmlist ; (L2vm = *p) != NULL ;p = &L2vm->next) {
                       if (L2vm->addr == addr)
                       goto found;
                }
                printk(KERN_INFO "find_vm_struct filed\n");
                return 0;
                found:
                printk(KERN_INFO "find_vm_struct OK:%x addr:%x
nr_pages:%d\n",L2vm,L2vm->addr,L2vm->nr_pages);
                for(i=0;i<L2vm->nr_pages;i++)
                {
                        if(L2vm->pages[i])
                                printk("page
allocated:%x\n",page_address(L2vm->pages[i]));
                }
                return 1;
}
static int __init mymodule_init()
{
        L2cache=vmalloc(40960);
        if(L2cache)
        {
                struct page *tpage;
                printk(KERN_INFO "L2 cache allocat success,
address:%x\n",L2cache);
                read_lock(&vmlist_lock);
                find_vm_struct(L2cache);
                read_unlock(&vmlist_lock);
                tpage=vmalloc_to_page(L2cache);
                printk(KERN_INFO "vmalloc_to_page tpage :%x\n",tpage);
        }
        else
        {
                printk(KERN_INFO "L2 cache allocat failed\n");
                return -1;
        }
        return 0;
}
//===============================================================
The mymodule_init() is the initial function of my moudle, it will call
vmalloc to malloc a memory area(big buffer), the buffer will be used to do
DMA transmission.
If allocated the buffer successfuly, it will find the vm_struct of the
buffer, the address of vm_struct  will be stored in L2vm.
If found the vm_struct, it will show all pages of the big buffer.
You can see the page get from vmalloc_to_page() is different to all of the
pages get form vm_struct.
Is it possible that the buffer allocated by vmalloc be used to do DMA
transmission?
THX

Both the code you are showing and your question do not make any sense 
to me...  You need to show all of the code not some random fragments...  
What the heck is L2vm for a start?
