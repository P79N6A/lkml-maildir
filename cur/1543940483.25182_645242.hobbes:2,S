I'm currently using "objcopy --extract-symbol -w -N \* -K input_data" to
create a .o with just the symbol I'm interested in and using -R on that.
There's also an option to add a prefix to all symbols which might be
useful.
I finessed the length issue slightly since it happens that the word
before the payload is the payload's length. I'm mulling a variety of
options:
      * declare it compression scheme dependant. At least for gzip it
        knows when it has reached the end.
      * codify the length followed by data thing we happen to have now
      * add a length field to the header, using another 4 bytes (is
        there any pressure on the size of the header?).
I'd probably go with the later unless we are pressed for space in the
header.
Ian.
