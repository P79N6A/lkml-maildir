sorry for late response.
(I didn't notice your mail ;-)
You are right...
stupid user space caching is very important problem.
but I think this is no libc problem.
glibc malloc hardly caches the memory.
(its default behavior only caching 128K.)
but some application use large memory for too opportunistic caching.
I understood we need propagandize that using mem_notify to application guys
after it merge mainline.
I have no idea of solve it easily.
