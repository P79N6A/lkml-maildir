There is a bug that works only on the 2.2.0 kernel that will allow root
and non-root users to crash the machine (the system reboots).
To replicate this bug do following:
Take any core file, and as normal user or root run: ldd core
The machine will reboot, saying that it cannot get execution permissions
for ./core
As far as I can tell, this problem only affects x86 machines running
2.2.0. I know that PPC is not affected.
Note: This problem does not occur in kernels before 2.2.0, and is
apparently fixed in 2.2.0ac1.
Thanks to Gennady Gurov (gurov@frii.com) for discovering this problem.
