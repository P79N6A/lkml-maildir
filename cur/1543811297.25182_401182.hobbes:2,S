Yes, I've been thinking about this.  The problem is that it's a change
to sd and a change to scsi_lib in a fairly critical routine.  While I'm
reasonably certain the change is safe, I'd prefer to make sure by
incubating in -mm for a while.
The title, by the way, is misleading; it's not a memory corruption in sd
at all really.  It's the initio bridge which produces a totally
standards non conformant return to a mode sense which produces the
problem.  And so, it's only the single initio bridge which is currently
affected; hence the caution.
