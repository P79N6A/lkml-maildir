There is an Alsa-sound-mini-HOWTO that says:
"4.5 Backwards compatibility 
 If you want to preserve OSS/Free or OSS/Linux compatibility, you need to
 insert one more driver: the snd-pcm1-oss driver for OSS-compatibility.
 Issue a
      modprobe snd-pcm1-oss
 This will give you /dev/audio and /dev/dsp-support, just as the OSS/Free
 (kernel) drivers and OSS/Linux (the $25 ones) do. Note that this is only
 an emulation."
