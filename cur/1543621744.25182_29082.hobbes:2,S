Hi Linus,
The patch has been changed like you wanted, with page->zone
shoved into page->flags. I've also pulled the thing up to
your latest changes from linux.bkbits.net so you should be
able to just pull it into your tree from:
bk://linuxvm.bkbits.net/linux-2.5-struct_page
You can also view the patch on:
http://surriel.com/patches/2.5/2.5.5-p2-struct_page5
I'm not retransmitting it to lkml as very little has changed.
Please apply the patch to your 2.5 tree.
thank you,
Rik
----> begin standard blurb of explanation <----
I've forward-ported a small part of the -rmap patch to 2.5,
the shrinkage of the struct page. Most of this code is from
William Irwin and Christoph Hellwig.
The executive summary:
o page->wait is removed, instead we use a hash table of wait
  queues per zone ... collisions are ok because of wake-all
  semantics
o page->virtual is only used on highmem machines and sparc64,
  other machines calculate the address instead
o page->zone is moved into page->flags
