There is no "safe" time on Linux. There is no loyalty to backward
compatibility. Your best bet is to make your book an online edition. I am
not sure what your original book is based on, but it is more than likely
obsolete the moment it hits the bookstores.
Without try to start any religious war: Unlike BSD where you can buy
Stevens vol 2 and just browse code today; i believe that it is almost a
hopeless attempt to document Linux. OTOH, unlike the BSD's
"15 years" in lack of instability^H^H^H^H^H^Hprogress -- Linux is always
on the leading edge. We learn from previous releases and fix them in newer
releases. I hope that spirit continues!
cheers,
