dget_parent() doesn't deal with the problem of rename() done directly
in that layer while you'd been waiting for i_mutex.

And?  Having a reference to dentry does not prevent it being moved
elsewhere by direct rename(2) in that layer.  It will exist, that
much is guaranteed by grabbing a reference.  However, there is no
warranties whatsoever that by the time you get i_mutex on what had
once been its parent, it will still remain the parent of our dentry.

You are thinking about non-interesting case.  _Files_ are not much
of a problem.  Directory tree is.  The real problems with all unionfs and
stacking implementations I've seen so far, all way back to Heidemann et.al.
start when topology of the underlying layer changes.  If you have clear
semantics for unionfs behaviour in presence of such things, by all means,
publish it - as far as I know *nobody* had done that; not even on the
"what should we see when..." level, nevermind the implementation.

It would; I honestly do not know if the problem is solvable with the
(lack of) constraints you apparently want.  Again, the real PITA begins
when you start dealing with pieces of underlying trees getting moved
around, changing parents, etc.  Cross-directory rename() certainly rates
very high on the list of "WTF had they been smoking in UCB?" misfeatures,
but it's there and it has to be dealt with.
BTW, and that's a completely unrelated story, I'd rather see whiteouts
done directly by filesystems involved - it would simplify the life big
way.  How about adding a dir->i_op->whiteout(dir, dentry) and seeing if
your variant could be turned into such a method to be used by really
piss-poor filesystems?  All UFS-related ones (including ext*) can trivially
support whiteouts without any PITA; adding them to tmpfs is also not a big
deal and anything that caches inode type in directory entries should be
easy to extend in the same way as ext*/ufs...
