Sory Alan but I don't want philosophical/historical discuss.
Try to answer on question "ALSA or OSS ?" using *only* technical arguments.
Maybe it is not clear for you but now way for introduce better OSS support 
for FOSS applications is completly oppened (there is no legal 
contrargumets fo not using OSS).
There is no ALSA on non-Linux systems (and will not be) so all other 
OSes/Unices will have better sound support than Linux (better on technical 
level and also on support level because all this systems will use 
common OSS) .. and it is only matter of time (when/how fast ?).
If you dont see this please stop ..
