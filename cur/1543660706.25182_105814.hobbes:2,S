That's what EXTRA_CFLAGS and CFLAGS_someobject.o are for.

The use of the kernel build process to build kernel modules is not 
_mandatory_, it's just that it's the only sane option.
You are, of course, welcome to hack up your own broken and short-term
solutions which happen to work this week for some platforms. But don't come
crying to us when (not if) they stop working.
The use of vermagic.c doesn't stop you from making your own build system; 
you can have your own vermagic.c to make your hacks work this week.
