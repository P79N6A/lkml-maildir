That is similar to what I get with idle=halt. Are you not using ACPI
for idle?
Try this:
$ pfmon -ecpu_clk_unhalted,interrupts_masked_cycles_with_interrupt_pending,interrupts_masked_cycles,cycles_no_fpu_ops_retired -k --system-wide -t 10
<session to end in 10 seconds>
CPU0     95016828 CPU_CLK_UNHALTED
CPU0     36472783 INTERRUPTS_MASKED_CYCLES_WITH_INTERRUPT_PENDING
CPU0     67484408 INTERRUPTS_MASKED_CYCLES
CPU0    445326968 CYCLES_NO_FPU_OPS_RETIRED
That's what I get with idle=halt.  Since the kernel doesn't do FP
the last line should equal clock cycles.  If it were running at full
speed it would be 16 billion...
