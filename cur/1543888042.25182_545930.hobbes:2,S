Yes this is a version is not using clocksource.

I can't yet run the test sequence on the latest kernel so I'll have to
wait to experiment.  A brief look at the new code seems to show a
similar path but I need to actually run though it to understand better.
On the irq_resend() path handle_dynamic_tick() is still called as
before.  The difference now is the handler looks like it will jump into
some generic event code in tick-common.c.  This still calls
ticker_periodic() which calls profile_tick() in and out of one-shot
mode.
It might be the path still exists or I've just not spent enough time
understanding the real flow.
Thanks for the insight and the nice code.

Ok. Thanks. I look forward to using that when I can.
