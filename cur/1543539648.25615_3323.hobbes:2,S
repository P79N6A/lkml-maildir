It's no good to have any capability other than CAP_SYS_RAWIO protect us
from direct talking to the drives via IOCTLs, because only after
switching this one off we can't do so by other means as well.
CAP_DESTROY_HARDWARE would be superfluous, you'd need to disable that,
*and* CAP_SYS_RAWIO as well to protect yourself from the damage.
Also, CAP_SYS_RAWIO is the exact capability meant for this type of
stuff.
