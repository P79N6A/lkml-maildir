Adding your highpte patches to the NUMA-Q seems to make no
performance impact whatsoever (just doing kernel compile). The
profiles are so similar, it almost looks like it's not doing anything at
all ;-) I find this a little strange, as all my ZONE_NORMAL is on
node 0, so I'd expected this to have some sort of impact (either 
positive or negative ;-)). 
Is there an easy way to test whether this was working or not?
Thanks,
M.
PS. yes I did remember to turn on the 4G-highpte option ;-)
