	Yes, the problem described in inside glibc 2.1 for INTEL systems.
	Report it to glibc maintainers.
	I side-step the problem with a code like this:
    struct statvfs statbuf;     /* SysV and BSD definitions differ..    */
    if ((rc = fstatvfs(fd, &statbuf)) == 0) {
      /* Sidestep a problem at glibc 2.1.1 when running at Linux/i386 */
      if (statbuf.f_frsize != 0)
        availspace = statbuf.f_bavail * statbuf.f_frsize;
      else
        availspace = statbuf.f_bavail * statbuf.f_bsize;
    }
