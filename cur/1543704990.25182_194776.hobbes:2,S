Ehh, wait a second: you're saying that your study proved that if the
device isn't failing, it isn't failing. ;-) Of course you'll get noise
and perhaps even lots of it due to cosmic rays but this doesn't say
anything about the error pattern you when a device _is_ failing (e.g.,
due to overheating, over-clocking, or wrong voltage).  Or did your
study cover the cases where a system is operated under "out-of-spec"
situation?

Yes.  And once I finally received Andi's earlier mails (guess I have
to thank MyDoom for that... ;-( ), it was clear that nobody argued for
turning off the error reporting.  The issue was only whether or not to
log a message via printk() (which, in this case, clearly isn't a good
idea).  So I think we're all in violent agreement.
