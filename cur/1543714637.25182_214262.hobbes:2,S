I'm aware of ioremap_nocache(), and the fact that it explicitly sets 
_PAGE_PCD. My  question originated after reading this posting by Alan
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0110.0/0878.html
in which he explicitly states that ioremap() gives uncached mapping. If 
you follow the thread, there is a general consensus that ioremap and 
ioremap_nocache are functionaly the same on x86 arch (and I suppose on 
most archs)
Thanx,
