I think there is mainly an issue with atomic incremets. I am not sure if the
counter can be incremeted concurrently, or if the code path would be
serialized, but there is always the reading side, which may need to retry an
read. Besides that, the counter is in the fast path, so it will add some
delay to packet handling.
I guess a 64bit implementation will need to be a per-cpu solution.
