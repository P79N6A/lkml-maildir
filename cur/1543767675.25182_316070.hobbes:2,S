Yes.
I'm talking about a different problem.  Here's a little example (it's
a little made up, because I didn't properly do my research yet)
  sysadmin makes an 'pkginstall' tool available to users with
  'sudo'
  'pkginstall' checks (with some signature) that the package is from a
  trusted source, before installing it.  (I don't know if real package
  managers can do this, but I can imagine so)
  'pkginstall' locks it's database before installation
  black hat user implements a filesystem, in which file open never
  returns.  Then mounts it and then runs 'sudo pkginstall
  /tmp/nastyfs/t.pkg'
  the result will be that no other users will be able to install
  packages until the sysadmin comes back and kills the hanging
  process.
I'm not sure if this is a problem is real life, but I can imagine it
being so. 
The basic reason is that with a synthetic filesystem controlled by the
user, the user gets to tamper with the operation of the suid/sgid
process.  There _is_ a reason why suid/sgid processes are not
ptrace()-able, and this is something very similar.

Not that I know of.  Even if they would, the reasoning is that they
would be vulnerable to being ptraced (and thus tempered with in
various ways) anyway.
So if you only allow access for processes that the filesystem owner
can ptrace, you made sure that you cannot "trap" any process you
couldn't already trap.

Probably true in most cases.  Optionally having a "suidless"
playground for users could be very nice and perfectly secure though.
