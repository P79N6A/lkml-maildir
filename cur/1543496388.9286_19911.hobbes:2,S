Hello,
I tried to upgrade to 2.2.7-ac4 (from 2.2.7-ac1), and got an instantaneous
freeze when 'plan' attempts to check other calendar (I do not know if
it related however).
Here are the latest outputs in /var/log/messages before it died :
May 18 17:08:54 dgps6 automount[635]: attempting to mount entry /a/obole.u0
May 18 17:08:54 dgps6 automount[635]: attempting to mount entry /a/obole.u10
May 18 17:08:54 dgps6 kernel: Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual
address d02baf50
Switching back to 2.2.7-ac1 cures the problem.
So, I guess (maybe wrong) that some NFS / autofs modification causes the
problem.
A+,
