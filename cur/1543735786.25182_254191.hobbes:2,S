   Yes, good point.  I had prototyped an ioctl interface (google
"dev_acpi").  In some ways it was more powerful, and the ioctl solved
this particular issue.  However, the data structures passed around on
read still use the data sizes as defined by the kernel.  I intended the
VERSION interface to help address this issue by returning an acpi_object
size buffer.  On an LP64 system, this is 24 bytes, on an ILP32 system,
it's 16.  Unfortunately, the ioctl interface also moved the
implementation out of sysfs and wasted the perfectly good directory
hierarchy already available there.
   So, I think the library wrapper will need to deal with the 32/64 bit
problem or we'll have to translate data structures to strictly defined
sizes.  Any other thoughts on how this could be done?  I'm concerned
about alignment issues too, so this is definitely an area that could use
some work.

   We could move the side-effect to the write operation, but that feels
far less intuitive and makes it more difficult to handle multiple write
operations.  Others have strong opinions one way or the other?  I know
Willy had the same opinion at one point (make the operation occur on the
write), I'm not sure if I've convinced him otherwise.

   If it solved the entire 32/64 bit problem, an ioctl would probably be
the right choice.  But it doesn't AFAICT.  I also like how this
implementation fits into the existing ACPI sysfs tree and that you can
get useful info simply by cat'ing a file.  Thanks,
