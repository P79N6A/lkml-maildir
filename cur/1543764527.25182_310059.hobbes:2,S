The patent problems in the USA alone should impose enough legal risks.
IANAL, but even RedHat considers them to be serious problems.
And note that most of their patents are also valid in the EU. If they 
are enforcible is a different question, but it might be enough to become
a legal risk that a lawsuit might be started against e.g. a mirror.

Which court is "higher ... than just the US judicial system"?
If you are in the USA, there's no legal instance between the US supreme 
court and god.

Unfortunately, life isn't fair.
It's Debian's choice how cautiously or brave they are regarding legal 
risks. But it has to be consistent.
Debian simply needs an overall policy for this.
But if you say that you want to avoid any legal risks in one area while 
saying "these are not my packages" about perhaps even more likely legal 
risks in other areas doesn't help anyone.
