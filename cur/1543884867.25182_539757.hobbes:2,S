Only this message is from dvb_attach():
> DVB: Unable to find symbol dst_attach()
Is it saying that it cannot load the module that dst_attach() is in (it
doesn't know what module that is, modprobe knows that).  If you enabled dst
support and deleted the module, it would be the same.
If you turn off dvb_attach() and also disable dst, you should instead get
this message:
dst_attach: driver disabled by Kconfig
Maybe that would look nicer with a "DVB:  " prefix?  That would easier if it
wasn't necessary to update the printk in each boilerplate stub function.  What
if one macro created these stubs....

These two messages are printed by the dvb-bt8xx driver, not by dvb_attach().
It would be trivial to change of course, but I'm not sure what would be
pedantically correct for both dst and non-dst based hardware.

The reason I changed that, is the dst_attach() already did return a
dvb_frontend pointer, it was just inside an enclosing structure.  i.e. what
existed before:
{
	struct dst_state *state;
	state = dst_attach(...);
	card->fe = &state->frontend;
} /* state goes out of scope */
The frontend is inside the state struct and the state pointer isn't saved
anywhere.  dvb-bt8xx just saves a frontend pointer from inside the dst state
and tosses the state pointer away.  So I changed that to:
	card->fe = dst_attach(...);
