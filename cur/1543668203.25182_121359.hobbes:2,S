That is what is labeled in the card, and as I said before, that it has _only_
one RJ45 connector, so it hardly can be a "Dual Port" card ;).
pci.ids has this:
10b7  3Com Corporation
    ...
    9805  3c980-TX 10/100baseTX NIC [Python-T]
        10b7 1201  3c982-TXM 10/100baseTX Dual Port A [Hydra]
        10b7 1202  3c982-TXM 10/100baseTX Dual Port B [Hydra]
        10b7 9805  3c980 10/100baseTX NIC [Python-T]
and my card gives:
(lspci -n)
00:12.0 Class 0200: 10b7:9805 (rev 78)
(lspci -v)
00:12.0 Ethernet controller: 3Com Corporation 3c980-TX 10/100baseTX NIC [Python-T] (rev 78)
        Subsystem: 3Com Corporation: Unknown device 1000
Donald's driver has:
    { 0x10B7, 0x9800, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, CH_3C980 },
    { 0x10B7, 0x9805, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, CH_3C9805 },
...
    {"3c980 Cyclone",
     PCI_USES_IO|PCI_USES_MASTER, IS_CYCLONE|HAS_HWCKSM, 128, },
    {"3c982 Dual Port Server Cyclone",
     PCI_USES_IO|PCI_USES_MASTER, IS_CYCLONE|HAS_HWCKSM, 128, },
ie, associates 0x10B7, 0x9805 with "3c982 Dual Port Server Cyclone".
