It is indeed. And about that fact that by the time he made that
declaration, he was not in a position to make it unilaterally.

A restriction in this case which I assert was present in the original
licence; not an 'additional restriction'.
If I wanted to distribute my code without restrictions, I'd have
contributed to a BSD kernel, or released my code under the terms 
"GPL but not if you really really don't fancy it".
I don't. I didn't.

Not without being in violation of the original licence. This isn't about
the resulting combined work, but about your permission to use the
_original_.
