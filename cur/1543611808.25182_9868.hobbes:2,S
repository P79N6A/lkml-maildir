I'll gladly try it, I prefer running stock Redhat released kernels anyway, 
but last time I checked, only 2.4.9-13 was out and it didn't fix the crash 
problem. So I went with the latest stable -ac kernel.
I can't boot kernels except for -ac patched kernels (because I have ext3 
file systems that I converted during the 7.1 -> 7.2 upgrade.)
Where can I get the 2.4.17-2 kernel or RPM?
Thanks!
