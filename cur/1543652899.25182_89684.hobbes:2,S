At the moment, perhaps the initrd mechanism might be a useful
interface for this. You'd just leave some space either at the
beginning or at the end of the real initrd (if there's one),
and put your data there.
Afterwards, you can extract it either from the kernel, or even
from user space through /dev/initrd (with "noinitrd")
Advantages:
 - fairly non-intrusive
 - (almost ?) all platforms support this way of handling "some
   object in memory"
 - easy to play with from user space
Drawbacks:
 - needs synchronization with existing uses of initrd
 - a bit hackish
I'd expect that there will be eventually a number of things that
get passed from old to new kernels (e.g. crash data, device scan
results, etc.), so it may be useful to delay designing a "clean"
interface (for this, I expect some TLV structure in the initrd
area would make most sense) until more of those things have
shown up.
