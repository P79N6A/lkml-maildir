The file already have both occurences, there are function names and
variable with "preferred", sometimes mixed in the same line.
If it can help, the last time a line which uses prefered_lft was
changed, it was more than a year ago (1ab1457c42bc078e5a9becd82a7f9f940b55c53a)
for a whitespace cleanup.
Most of the occurences haven't been touched since the conversion to git.
regards,
Benoit
PS: I don't really care, it's just that I was touching the lifetime code
and tought that maybe I should try to change the whole file before
submitting my code.
