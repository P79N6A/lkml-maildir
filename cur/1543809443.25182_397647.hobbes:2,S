We have at least three
Disk reported C/H/S
BIOS reported C/H/S (hda/hdb only)
Actual C/H/S (if it exists)
Partition table C/H/S
A partitioning tool needs to know
	Disk reported C/H/S
	Partition table C/H/S
	Preferably BIOS reported C/H/S if there is one
The partition table C/H/S is on disk so trivial
The disk reported ones are in the identify block so could be pulled via
	/proc and sysfs
The BIOS one is PC specific low memory poking around
I agree entirely that HD_GETGEO itself shouldn't matter.
