Sheesh, when you can reprogram the chipset identity so that you can make
it appear to be mimic older chipsets that have current support, well you
get the headache!

It is not so much the chipset of the drivers, it is the jokers making
mainboards.  At the last meeting in Irvine there were issues about PCB
lane designs and chipset that cause problems in crosstalk or create bad
timing skews.  The problem is so wide spread in the industry that T13 is
looking at drafting a possible design annex for defined how to test and
create good hardware.  (I do not need the noise, I know this is what we
should be doing and not screwing up/down hardware) ;-)

The 2.4.0 kernels now have the very first created in the software industry
of ATA an auto-dma-crc transfer rate recovery callback.  Thus if you get
only the 0x84/0x51 errors and there are no other problems and you chipset
code is full-featured to have a hwif->speedproc callback, it will auto set
the transfer-rate down until the iCRC errors stop.

But the price to pay is SCSI noise in ATA devices, or was that pig lips
flapping in the breeze...?
