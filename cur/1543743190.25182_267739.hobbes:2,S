Hi,
I was looking over the /include/linux/module.h file, and the
EXPORT_SYMBOL_NOVERS macro caught my eye. To quote the source:
  /* We don't mangle the actual symbol anymore, so no need for
   * special casing EXPORT_SYMBOL_NOVERS.  FIXME: Deprecated */
  #define EXPORT_SYMBOL_NOVERS(sym) EXPORT_SYMBOL(sym)
A quick grep through the tree brought up no usage cases for this macro.
Is there any reason to keep it around, instead of cutting it out, as the
FIXME comment seems to suggest?
