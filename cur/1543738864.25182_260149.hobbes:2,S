I like that suggestion.  As Paul has been sucked away to other work,
thus giving me a chance to work on my code.  I will be focusing on
getting the cpusets/CKRM style interface working with my sched_domains
API.  I like the reparent_domain() suggestion, and it makes sense with
the 'mv' command, in regards to the filesystem model that cpusets/CKRM
currently uses.
