Alan,
I see on ftp.us.kernel.org there is a 2.2.12-forlinuz.gz that appears
to have the RAID patches in patch-2.2.12-final.gz backed out.  Is the
"plan" to >NOT< include the RAID patches in 2.2.12 now?  If so, when
will the RAID patches be included in an "offical" kernel?  Do you plan
on keeping the RAID patches in an "ac" kernel as previously stated?
Thanks,
fwr
