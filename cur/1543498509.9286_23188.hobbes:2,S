I didn't say you couldn't find any hack at all. You found one in fact,
and it sure looks like a bad joke.

Why such a bother? Devfs is easy to use, unlike your hack.

Arrrgh!!!
Can't you see all the contortions you are going through? If you need to
mount two small ram disks to deal with the r/o root mount, something is
very wrong. I'd say you have chosen an inappropriate solution.
Yes, your system does work. You found a way to avoid devfs, but you ended
up with something far more complicated and kludgy. Considering the problems
with your root filesystem, your system might even be less reliable.
