This leaves me holding
a97_plugin_wm97xx	-	waiting final device assignment
hal2			-	For SGI. Not sure if its needed
				as there is good ALSA support
harmony			-	For PARISC. Same comment as hal2
and the config fixes which depend on the hal2/harmony decision. What
would the maintainers prefer - merge them or rely on the ALSA ones ?
It also leaves cs4281 differently broken to before. That needs a lot
more work but I'm digging into it currently
