Subject: [patch] sched-2.5.64-D3, more interactivity changes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/3/17/39

the attached patch (against BK-curr) implements more finegrained timeslice
distribution, without changing the total balance of timeslices, by
recalculating the priority of CPU-bound tasks at a finer granularity, and
by roundrobining tasks. Right now this new granularity is 50 msecs (the
default timeslice for default priority tasks is 100 msecs).
Could people, who can reproduce 'audio skips' kind of problems even with
BK-curr, give this patch a go?
