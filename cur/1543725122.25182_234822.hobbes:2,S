Yep, we should have all the information we need, it's just a matter of 
translating it into something useful.  Since routers tend to group together 
nodes in groups of 4 or 8, a node herd with that many nodes might make sense, 
but also might be too small.  We might want everything within a set of 
metarouters in a group instead, or in addition, or...
