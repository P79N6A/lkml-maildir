The GPL - derivative work is the boundary not code linkage. Possibly a userspace
tuner hack would probably fit this too. Especially if a specific vendor is
producing both bits together and trying to claim they are independant.

No, I would assume they'd provide a proprietary conversion library that
no nobody would use (just like their hw). We keep format conversion firmly
seperated from hardware I/O processing.
