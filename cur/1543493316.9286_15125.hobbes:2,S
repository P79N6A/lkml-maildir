I have to write device driver for based on ISA slot A/D converter card. 
The card does not generate hardware interrupts and I need to pool status
register to check if data are ready to retrive.  As I know task queues and
kernel timers work with jiffies which resolution is 100 per second , while
the A/D card works at about 70kHz. What is the simplest way to implement
that kind of pooling without processor lock in busy wait loop.
I will be grateful for any clue.
