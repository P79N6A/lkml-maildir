		Hello all,
	I've encountered some problems in using the iproute tool under 2.2.1. I'm pretty new in using
it so don't blame me O:-) I just wanted to establish a ipip tunnel betweeen 2 hosts (ns and zerg here),the iptunnel
utility contained in nettools 1.50 didn't want to compile on my libc5 machines so I've decided to use iproute. I've 
added the 2 tunnels (ifconfig _doesn't_ show'em to me :-( ) and when I try adding routes ... see below :-(
[root@zerg]:~# ip tunnel show
tunl0: ip/ip  remote any  local any  ttl inherit  nopmtudisc
gre0: gre/ip  remote any  local any  ttl inherit  nopmtudisc
tunl1: ip/ip  remote 212.93.158.1  local 212.93.129.104  ttl inherit 
[root@ns]:~# ip tunnel show
tunl0: ip/ip  remote any  local any  ttl inherit  nopmtudisc
gre0: gre/ip  remote any  local any  ttl inherit  nopmtudisc
tunl1: ip/ip  remote 212.93.129.104  local 212.93.158.1  ttl inherit 
[root@ns]:~# ip route add 212.93.129.104 dev tunl1
RTNETLINK error: No such device

	Is there any extra /dev file I have to build?
	I have a /dev/route with a major of 36, so i think I did rtfm at least half right... I thought maybe 
Alexey is busy so I've forwarded this mail to the list too.
	Please help me if you have any suggestions.
Stefan
