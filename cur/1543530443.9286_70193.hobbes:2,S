Sorry to contradict you, but Linux has been _always_ this way. There are
ongoing efforts on 2.2.x and 2.0.x bug fixes, still strong for 2.2 but
rather low-level in 2.0.
Driver compatibility was broken every single time the middle digit went
from one stable series to the next. In any case, tell me of _one_ system
where you can just drop in the fresh out of the editor, latest & greatest,
driver into your 2 or 3 year old setup and have it work.
Get real.
