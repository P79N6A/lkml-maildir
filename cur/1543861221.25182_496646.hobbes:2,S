http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.20-rc3/2.6.20-rc3-mm1/broken-out/driver-core-per-subsystem-multithreaded-probing.patch
Hrm. I disagree with this change. I have a few cases where drivers
actually want to explicitely do that. I suppose they can always fire off
a thread themselves from probe() but I don't see the reason to move it
to the bus type...
Easy enough for the bus type to force it if it wants.
