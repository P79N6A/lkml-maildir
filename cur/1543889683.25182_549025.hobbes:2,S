So? The bootup isn't that much worse than a disk suspend/resume, and it's 
reliable.
And actually, I don't use laptops much. I use mostly desktops, and STR 
works fine on at least some of them. In contrast, doing some 
suspend-to-disk thing would just be insane and idiotic. If I have to wait 
for half a minute and have a slow system even after that because my git 
trees aren't in the cache, I really might as well just shut them off.
In contrast, STR means they are quiet and don't waste energy when I don't 
use them, but they're instantly available when I care. HUGE difference.
I really think suspend-to-disk is just a total waste of my time.
