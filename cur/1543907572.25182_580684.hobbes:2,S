Nobody fancies doing bi-endian MIPS ?

For now. Its a logical direction however thant we end up with bigger page
sizes either by hardware or by software merging and end up having
different page sizes for legacy 32bit binaries.

The information needed to parse /proc/pid/pagemap can be stuck
in /proc/pid/somewherelese. If we ever get page size variations and the
like then /proc/pid/ is going to end up with that information anyway for
ps and friends to use.
