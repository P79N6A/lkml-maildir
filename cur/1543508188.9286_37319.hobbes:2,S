Hi,
    Thanks Matthew for the help.
    Does that mean that as of now (in linux 2.2.9) the 
spin_lock(&lastpid_lock) and read_lock(&tasklist_lock) in the get_pid()
function in fork.c are redundant?
    Also, why is current->lock_depth used in lock_kernel() macro? We could
have just used kernel_flag as a lock variable?
Bye,
Sushil.
