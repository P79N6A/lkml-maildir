Subject: PROBLEM: 2.2.5 Freezes at cal delay loop

I'm running Slackware 3.6, and every time I compile the 2.2.5 kernel, 
it freezes at the Calibrating Delay Loop.  I ran 2.2.3 fine without
running into this problem.  My computer is:
Motherboard: Tyan Tomcat IV S1564D Dual CPU
CPU's: Dual Intel 586 233MMX's
MEM: 80M
Bios: Award
I haven't been able to figure out why it's doing this. If you could
provide me with any insite, I'd greatly appreciate it.  Thank you.
