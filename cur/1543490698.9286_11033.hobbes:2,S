I don't use egcs but I do have gcc 2.7.2.3 and 2.8.1 installed; I don't know
if the following is relevant to egcs or not. They are both run from the same
front-end (gcc); 2.8.1 is the default:
loth:~$ gcc -v
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i686-pc-linux-gnu/2.8.1/specs
gcc version 2.8.1
Selecting 2.7.2.3 can be done with the -V switch:
loth:~$ gcc -V 2.7.2.3 -v
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i686-pc-linux-gnu/2.7.2.3/specs
gcc driver version 2.8.1 executing gcc version 2.7.2.3
If you look in /proc/version you should see which one you compiled with (shove
the -V x.y.z into the top-level kernel Makefile's CFLAGS to select):
loth:~$ cat /proc/version
Linux version 2.2.4-pre6 (root@loth) (gcc driver version 2.8.1 executing
 gcc version 2.7.2.3) #58 Mon Mar 22 23:46:10 GMT 1999
