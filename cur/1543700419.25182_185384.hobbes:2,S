Version 2.6.3 of perfctr, the Linux/x86 performance
monitoring counters driver, is now available at the usual
place: 
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/perfctr/
Version 2.6.3, 2003-12-21
- Fixed a bug where a read of the global-mode counters could
  fail with EOVERFLOW due to an incorrect structure descriptor.
  The bug only existed in perfctr-2.6.2.
  (Thanks to Pavel Machek for reporting this problem.)
- AMD64 IA32 emulation code cleaned up for kernel 2.4.23.
- Updated kernel support: 2.6.0, 2.4.24-pre1, 2.4.23,
  2.4.22-1.2129.nptl (FC1 update), 2.4.21-1.1931.2.393.ent
  (RHEL Taroon beta), and 2.4.20-24 (RH 7.x/8/9 update).
- User-space package rpm spec file fixes:
  * Don't remove /dev/perfctr on package uninstall.
  * Don't add alias to /etc/modules.conf if it's already there.
