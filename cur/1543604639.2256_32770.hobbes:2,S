Hello,
    Last night I tried 2.4.12.  I patched a stock 2.4.10 kernel with 2.4.11.donuse and then with 2.4.12.  It compiled the kernel, but make modules failed miserably with all sorts of errors and warnings.  Should I have patched my 2.4.10 with 2.4.12 and just skipped over 2.4.11?  The patching went fine, the compiling was a mess.
    Needless to say that I have reverted back to 2.4.10 which seems to be doing fine on my machine.
    This kinda reminds me of the 2.2.x series when around 2.2.14 the kernel started getting stable. 
Joe
