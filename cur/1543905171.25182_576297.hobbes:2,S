I'm using the kvm-33 *userspace* package (based on Debian's kvm-28 packaging) 
and 2.6.23-rc1's KVM modules. I patched 2.6.23-rc1 with the patch you 
provided in your last email. So I'm not using -git HEAD.
Maybe there's been additional necessary fixes to -git requiring me to update 
to HEAD? That wasn't clear from your last email.
