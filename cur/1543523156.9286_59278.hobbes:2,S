mem_mmap was removed from proc_mem_operations in 2.3.27. This is a kernel
feature.
mmapping /proc/self/mem is no more possible, and the call returns
-ENODEV because f_op->mmap is always NULL (see mm/mmap.c).
This means that DOS programs using EMS will fail on kernels
>2.3.26; the memory mapping used in the dosemu EMS code should be
reworked for 2.4.
If you need to use such programs, please (sigh) use kernel 2.2.
