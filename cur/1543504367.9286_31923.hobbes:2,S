Assuming your motherboard has an option to boot from SCSI before IDE.
* Set the M/B to boot SCSI before IDE.
* Put your / partition on SCSI ID 0.
* Add these lines to /etc/lilo.conf
boot=/dev/sda
disk=/dev/sda
	bios=0x80
  plus any other config lines you need.
bios=0x80 tells LILO "/dev/sda is the boot disk, ignore what the BIOS
says".  Without that, LILO tends to assume that the first IDE drive is
the boot disk, with nasty results.
Works for me.
