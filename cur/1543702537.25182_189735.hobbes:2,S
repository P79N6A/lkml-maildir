I got the following compile error when trying to compile 
sound/pci/cmipci.c statically into the kernel:
<--  snip  -->
...
  CC      sound/pci/cmipci.o
sound/pci/cmipci.c: In function `alsa_card_cmipci_setup':
sound/pci/cmipci.c:3300: error: `joystick' undeclared (first use in this function)
sound/pci/cmipci.c:3300: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
sound/pci/cmipci.c:3300: error: for each function it appears in.)
make[2]: *** [sound/pci/cmipci.o] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
