I don't think that is a big problem. Think about how it evolves over time
App calls pthread_foo   libpthreads/ngpt does all the work by emulation
	Add CLONE_somefoo
App calls pthread_foo	libpthreads/ngpt does all the work by emulation
			and doesnt set the flag
	New libpthreads
App calls pthread_foo	libpthreads/ngpt uses the kernel assists
The behaviour is good - it means that the new kernel/old library setup won't
break the emulation gunge by suddenely providing precise semantics itself
