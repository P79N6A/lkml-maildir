Hi,
Having done a few more reboots I got more info -- one of the eepro100
interfaces is dead only in 4 out 5 cases. So, sometimes, doing ifdown eth0
; ifup eth0 does help.
So, the latest status: all 6G of RAM work fast but the onboard eepro100
interface, often, doesn't work. This starts to look like eepro100-driver
related so I copied Andrey Savochkin. Btw, one of my colleagues also
reported a similar situation on his quad Xeon with 6G RAM whereby one of
the eepro100 interfaces was dead until one restarts it.
Starting to fiddle with eepro100.c now...
Regards,
Tigran
