Ok, I've just gotten a successful boot on this box for the first time in
like 15 git releases.  I needed the three patches below:
clameter-fallback_alloc_fix2 -- from earlier in this thread, under the
message ID below:
    <Pine.LNX.4.64.0610131515200.28279@schroedinger.engr.sgi.com>
Reintroduce-NODES_SPAN_OTHER_NODES-for-powerpc -- the patch I just
submitted, under the message ID below:
    <8a76dfd735e544016c5f04c98617b87d@pinky>
ibmveth-fix-index-increment-calculation -- this patch is already in -mm.
Feel free to take this as an ACK for the patches other than mine.
