Hmm, it seems to be a pyxis bug; the hardware workaround exists, but
I guess that it might be not implemented properly on early miatas.
This also explains why I don't have that problem on lx164 and sx164.

"A.1 Read Page Problem
 PCI DMA reads that attempt to cross 8K page boundaries cause data corruption
 problems. A fix has been implemented with an Altera 7032 and two Pericom
 PI5C3400 bus switches and a diode."

Certainly - the 2nd bus is behind PCI-PCI bridge.
