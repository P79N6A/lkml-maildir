But you keep on missing the point that this only happens in the initial
stage of tasks competing for CPU resources.
If this is broken, then current smt nice is equally broken with the same
reasoning: once the low priority task gets scheduled, there is nothing
to kick it off the CPU until its entire time slice get used up.  They
compete equally with a high priority task running on the sibling CPU.
