Or perhaps that it tends to result in better solutions than what would
exist if every vendor wrote their drivers with no consideration for
other vendors.

This sounds equivalent to "write your own block driver".

Except that you would have to re-implement the SCSI upper-layer drivers
(at a minimum). Seems like it would be easier to take the existing code
in your driver/layers and modify to work with the existing SCSI
infrastructure.

Seems silly to have all this code duplication.  Why not write to the
existing spec (even if it is an informal one), and then work to get the
spec changed, hopefully without pissing off all the maintainers.

I am not sure if Jeff meant this as a tongue-in-cheek suggestion or is
just trying to get you off peoples backs. Perhaps he is indeed
serious.
