Although I don't like finding world-writable files in tar archives, I
think you're exagerating a bit. First, you're not turning normal bugs
into root privileges, and second, you don't need to create a user just
for this, you just have to extract it in a directory that other users
cannot access (chmod o-x).
Also, you'll find several other software on the net with full rights,
so if this really is a concern to you, you'd better get used to this
with simple and reliable solutions (ntp comes to mind).
