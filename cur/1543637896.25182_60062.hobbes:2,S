Another large part of the work is in pursuing innovations in software 
that fail.  Note that failed software is generally not maintained.
What I don't understand about Viro's argument is why he thinks that 
maintainers won't also get paid under the schemes discussed.  There is 
nothing that prevents paying for maintenance in either scheme.
