Hello,
I am writing a kernel module, and I would like to allow user space to
hand me a FILE, and then for my kernel module to keep a reference on its
inode regardless what the user space program does with the FILE. 
1) Is this good practice?
2) How do I get notified when the filesystem the inode is on is being   
unmounted so I can release my reference? So that I don't block the
unmount.
I am not subscribed so please CC on my replies. 
Thank you.
