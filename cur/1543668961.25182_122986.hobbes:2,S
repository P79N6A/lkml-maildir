Hi all,
	Im a bit new to sparc kernel/hardware and I have been hitten by a
problem compiling alsa modules.
In a few words loading the modules i get the following error:
mazinga:/usr/src/modules/alsa-driver# insmod snd-page-alloc
Using /lib/modules/2.4.21-pre7/kernel/sound/acore/snd-page-alloc.o
/lib/modules/2.4.21-pre7/kernel/sound/acore/snd-page-alloc.o: unresolved
symbol virt_to_bus_not_defined_use_pci_map
poking around I found that io.h has this entry on sparc64:
extern unsigned long virt_to_bus_not_defined_use_pci_map(volatile void  *addr);
#define virt_to_bus virt_to_bus_not_defined_use_pci_map
while in other archs there is some "real" code.
I understand "use_pci_map" but what i would really like to know is:
* why is virt_to_bus missing from sparc64?
* which is the best way to fix the code? kernel or alsa???
I have also been trying to look at 2.5.66 kernel but unfortunatly I cannot
even boot it to confirm that is working or not (atleast to try a backport
or something)
Any help would be really appreciated.
Thanks
Fabio
