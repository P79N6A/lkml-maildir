I too am trying the 2.6 kernel per Linus' desires and also have an SBLive! . 
However, I absolutely *destest* kernel modules. To my knowledge, ALSA has 
been exclusively module-oriented. I'm going to assume that in 2.6 you can 
build ALSA into a monolithic kernel. Is this assumtion valid? If so, will the 
referenced documents above apply to getting my sound working? Or are there 
other documents/resources that I need to be reading to get non-modular ALSA 
working? Thanks.
