Hi, Alan.
    I update the patch merge with 2.4.19-rc2-ac2 for fix minor things
with pdc202xx.c, patch-2.4.19rc1-ac series and patch-2.4.19rc2-ac
series has some different with pdc202xx.c, I don't know who rewrite
this code...Why pdc202xx_ratefilter() down UDMA mode with
tune_chipset function?
    Now we are the maintainer of pdc202xx controllers. We know the
ASIC detail spec. So please let us modify and maintain.
We can provide best support for world wide Promise users.
    Alan, please merge this patch in your series. thanks.
    Marcelo, Maybe you can help us to merge with 2.4.19rc3?
Thanks in advance
