Subject: How to dump the page addresses of a kmem_cache object?

Hi,
I allocated a kmem_cache object with function kmem_cache_create().
After I do kmem_cache_alloc(), several pages should be assigned to
this kmem_cache object.
My question is: how can I dump the addresses of the pages allocated to
this cache? Can someone give me a rough idea or direct me to somewhere
to find the solution?
Thanks in advance for your help!
Xin
