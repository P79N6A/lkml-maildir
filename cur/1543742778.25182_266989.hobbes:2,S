Subject: [2.6.10-rc1-mm2] Firmware loader gone bogus?

Ive upgraded from 2.6.9-rc4-mm1 to 2.6.10-rc1-mm2 and now the firmware 
loader seems broken. I have an internal wlan-adapter that runs the 
ipw2200-driver and I get errors when trying to load the firmware.
Then I tried my prism54-based card and got the following errors in dmesg:
Loaded prism54 driver, version 1.2
PCI: Enabling device 0000:03:00.0 (0000 -> 0002)
ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:03:00.0[A] -> GSI 6 (level, low) -> IRQ 6
eth1: resetting device...
eth1: uploading firmware...
prism54: request_firmware() failed for 'isl3890'
eth1: could not upload firmware ('isl3890')
eth1: islpci_reset: failure
The firmware files are in place and both these cards with drivers have 
worked fine before. Config attached
