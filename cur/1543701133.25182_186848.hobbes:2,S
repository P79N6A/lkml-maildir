Agreed.  Several BK developers do this, forgetting that one of things 
that makes BK so useful is its merge technology.
I recommend (assuming no patches outstanding),
* clone latest tree
* do development
* only 'bk pull' from latest tree iff (a) you are about to submit to 
Linus/Andrew or (b) you know there is a conflicting change in upstream
Pulling the latest, just to be up-to-date, just obfuscates things and 
needlessly increases the size of the master ChangeSet file.
