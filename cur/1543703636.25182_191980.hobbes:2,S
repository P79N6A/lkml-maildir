Hello Linus, Andrew,
I'm about to send you a set of 5 patches that sync the
LinuxTV.org CVS with latest linux-2.6.1/linux-2.6.1-mm4.
As usual, detailed informations about what changed can be 
found at the top of each file.
The patch "04-DVB-av7110-driver-splitup.diff" is bzip2'ed,
because it removes the av7110 DVB driver source and replaces
it with a modularized version. Sorry for the inconvenience!
Please apply! 
CU
Michael.
