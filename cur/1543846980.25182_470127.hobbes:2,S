Looks fine to me.  Other than the general question of why WARN_ON* 
returns a value at all, and if so, does the final unlikely() really do 
anything.

Sure, the CPU has the option, but if it goes around speculatively 
polluting its caches with unused stuff, it isn't going to perform very 
well in general.  So presumably the CPU won't do it unless it really 
thinks it will help.
