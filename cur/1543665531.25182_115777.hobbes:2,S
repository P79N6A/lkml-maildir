Nope, did not fix it.  I tried to grab all patches from mm2, as well as
any others that was lying around.
------------------------------
man3 # ls Hash\:\:Util.*
ls: Hash::Util.tmp: No such file or directory
Hash::Util.3pm.gz
nosferatu man3 # 
------------------------------
And for some reason its only with the Hash::Util* files that it have
this problem.  Am assuming it might not be related to the filename
itself ?
This is what I get when I fsck it:

nosferatu root # e2fsck -f /dev/hdg1 
e2fsck 1.32 (09-Nov-2002)

Like I said, just say how I can try to debug this.
