I found out that 'shutdown' is the default and that I was already using
that. Strange.
I did finally now get around to doing a more through battery of tests with
many combinations of hibernating with 'platform' and 'shutdown' modes, and
various GRUB 'halt' and 'reboot' commands. What I came up with is that
basically nothing works.
In essentially all cases (except for rare inexplicable instances when it
_does_ work, though I cannot replicate it with any consistency) the special
keys _are_ functional immediately after power-on, through GRUB, through
kernel initialization, through reading the suspended image. But then
immediately after control is passed to the resumed system, the keys stop
working.
Does this give you any other clues as to what might be going on?

Ian Morgan
