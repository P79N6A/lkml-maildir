No.  Tried it in the past, just tried it again to make sure.
The caching should be done client-side, I guess, to be effective. Even
if the server acknowledges operations before they hit the disks, the
client is still bound by the RPC call latency.
I'm sure there are problems preventing such caching...  Hmm... Seems
like the only way out is a multi-threaded tar   ;)   Or tar using AIO.
Btw. nocto on the client doesn't really seem to help matters much
either.
Thanks for the suggestion,
