Well, I think he really wanted to know why it's bad.  Emmanuel, suppose process A
takes spinlock S then sleeps.  Process B is then scheduled and tries to acquire
S - bang, deadlock: Process A can't release the spinlock because it's sleeping.
Let alone the fact that another CPU trying to acquire S is going to end up
stalled potentially many milliseconds before process A wakes up again and
releases the spinlock.
