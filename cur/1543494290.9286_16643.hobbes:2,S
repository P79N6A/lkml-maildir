This is where this benchmark gets in, not in compile time, again has nothing
to do with it, all the problem begins when HINT (a 9kb executable) is
running and it tells you how much the hardware can do in intervals of
time but the point is that in the same machine FreeBSD has a better
performance than linux, HINT overloads tha machine to its maximum
running floating point operations and it fill the L1 cache then the L2 cache
then RAM and then swap, then it finished telling you how much your
machine do. If somebody though about the poor linux performance in this
area i think we can achieve a better in unbeatable OS.
