OK, I'm going to try this on 2.6.  The sensor I use isn't in the kernel: 
asb100 (Asus's ASIC).
I know for a fact the 2.6 doesn't support nearly as many sensors as the 
lm-sensors package, but I never tried getting it all setup on 2.6 since 
2.6 hasn't been stable enough for what I needed it for.  I thought that 
lm-sensors merely used the in-kernel i2c interface but provided it's own 
driver modules.  I realize that the documentation says to build only the 
user utilities, but I thought that was just an error.  I let portage 
take care of all the details.
