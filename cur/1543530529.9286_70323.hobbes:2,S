Will BUG() remain enabled in 2.4?
I always assumed that BUG() is the replacement for "*(int*)0=0", and that it
remains enabled in 2.4.
KASSERT() could be disabled in 2.4, and thus we could add such tests even to
time critical functions [I hope WAITQUEUE_DEBUG, SPINLOCK_DEBUG, the BUG()
in unlock_kernel() get disabled/removed before 2.4]
