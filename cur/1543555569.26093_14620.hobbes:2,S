Hi Alexander,
I am "hammering" an ext2 filesystem with all sorts (bonnies, make -j8
bzImage, cp -a dir1 dir2 + all these over localhost NFSv3) for a while and
so far it survives. The system is 2way SMP with 1G RAM.
However, I can't say that _without_ your patch the above did _not_
survive. The corruptions usually come from real useful work and not from
articfical tests (unfortunately)....
Regards,
Tigran
