There was a post on linux-kernel earlier today stating that "hdx=scsi" did
not work correctly if both were compiled as modules for 2.4.10-testxx and
a patch was posted.
I can confirm that this is true for 2.2.x, with "hdx=ide-scsi". Once I
compiled both statically into the kernel, it works.
Perhaps somone can backport the fixes? It would be nice to change 2.2 so
it can accept "hdx=scsi" for compatiblity with 2.4.
Cheers,
Alex
