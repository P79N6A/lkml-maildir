Subject: [Patch 10/10]: ext3 online resize: make group-add asynchronous.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

There's not much to be gained from making the resize group-add operation
fully synchronous.  It's already atomic by virtue of the journal, and a
resize operation usually doesn't add just one group, but many.  The real
need is to sync things up at the end of the *entire* resize, not after
each individual group-add; and by syncing each group separately, the
whole resize operation is made much, much slower if we're running on a
live filesystem.
