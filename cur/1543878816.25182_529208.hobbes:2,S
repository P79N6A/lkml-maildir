Have you read the "Understanding the Linux Virtual Memory Manager" book by Mel 
Gorman ? It describes the virtual memory manager in details. I was impressed 
by the amount of technical information Mel Gorman gathered and explained 
clearly in a single book. Given the ever-changing nature of the Linux kernel, 
such detailed documentation about core subsystem is often hard to find.
You can get the book at
