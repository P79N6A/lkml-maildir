Could you please tell me how to apply your patch. Aginst 2.5.62-ac2?
I have a ext2 fs corruption problem at PIO mode on 2.5.67-ac2.
There is no problem on vanilla 2.5.67.
I tryed the all patches below.
 tf-ioctls-1.diff
 tf-ioctls-2a.diff
 tf-ioctls-2b.diff
 tf-ioctls-3.diff
 tf-ioctls-4.diff
 tf-dio-1.diff
 tf-dio-2.diff
 tf-dio-3.diff
 tf-dio-4.diff
 masked-irq.diff
They didn't solve problem.
This pio-fixes.diff can't be applied after them?

Osamu Tomita
