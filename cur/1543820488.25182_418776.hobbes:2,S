Personally, I view such contests or challenge machines as meaningless.
At best, they can only show the presence of a flaw, never that the
system is "secure".  And the people most capable of breaking such
systems are not likely to go near such a play machine knowingly.  The
SELinux play machines were nice from an educational point of view,
allowing people to experiment with a SELinux system without needing to
install and set it up themselves, particularly in the days when SELinux
was not integrated into any distro.  But as a meaningful measure of
security, such contests or challenge/play machines aren't really useful.
