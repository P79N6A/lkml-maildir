No. Sizes are not "logical". They are whatever you decide they are, ie
it's purely a complier convention.
At least earlier, size_t was defined as "unsigned int" in user mode, and
doing anything else would make gcc complain about clashes with its
compiled-in __builtin_size_t that it uses for the builtin prototypes (ie
if you had a declaration for "void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src,
size_t n);" and your size_t didn't match the gcc builtin_size_t, you'd get
a "redefined with different arguments" warning or something).
