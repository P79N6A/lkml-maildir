No, usbfs hasn't undergone any significant changes recently.
Tino, it would help to see a kernel log showing what happened during 
the suspend, resume, and failure of hidmon.  It would help even more if 
you test under a kernel with CONFIG_USB_DEBUG enabled.
Even if you can't reproduce the problem, do you have the complete 
kernel log from before?
Is it possible that this is really a problem with the LCD device, not 
with the kernel?  I ask because if the device was working properly then 
unplugging and replugging the USB cable should do a complete reset.
