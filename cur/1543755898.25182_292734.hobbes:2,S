There is no FUD in all what I said, for the simple reasons that we
are saying exactly the same thing: 
	* the data is there
	* the metadata is there
	* all that is missing is some metadata boundaries.

My good friend Larry would have you believe that I said something
I just never did. Go back and read the archives.

Exactly. You see, you understood exactly what I did say. And I'm pretty
sure all the audience did.

I'm not interested in ranting. I already did say that BK was good
for the kernel development, what more would you like me to say ?

This would be nice indeed and I think it would end up all whinning
since using that, one could be able to get the full history from the
bkcvs repository. But would you do that ?

I was merely proposing my help to do something you said you don't
wanna do because it would consume too much resources. Does this
proposal deserves such a rude answer ? 
Moreover, I said "you may consider...", not "I am aware it is...".
Using BK to write a script which helps extracting the metadata is not
clearly a violation, since the script itself does not "compete with
the BitKeeper Software.". This part a clarification, and this is
what I asked for.
The distribution of the metadata is clearly a violation, but you
didn't quote that part of the proposal...

I don't see what 'polite' has to do with it. If one of us tends to
be rude I would say that's you...
Anyway, it is perfectly valid to ask the author(s) for an exception 
to the distribution license. The author is free to reject the demand,
or to accept it if there is some interest in doing so.
Stelian.
