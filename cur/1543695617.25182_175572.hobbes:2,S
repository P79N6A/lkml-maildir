Well, gettimeofday() is supposed to return UT. It does not care at all
about local time, which would be a 100% userspace problem if it were
not for broken filesystems which store timestamps in local time.
Going off-topic: on a typical distribution the files used for UT to 
localtime conversion are in/usr/share/zoneinfo. Also ntp exclusively
transmits UT, and is certainly not responsible for these hour steps.
