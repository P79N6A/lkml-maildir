yep, the image was in a 128 MB chunk from which 88 MB was left empty and 
modules started at the next 128 MB boundary. The largest image i ever 
had was around 44MB, so i doubt it's an issue in practice. Mind doing a 
patch that reinstates it, by lowering the 512 image size limit to 508 
MB? [4MB should be more than enough in practice]
