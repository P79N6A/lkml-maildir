Yes something like that.  Although it doesn't provide for the 
get_task_tgid case, and your patch only get_task_pid.

I just might.  Coming up with an idiom that is hard to get wrong,
is desirable here, or at least with an idiom that is consistent.
I need to sleep on it before I can answer which way we handle that.
The pain with a new idiom is that I will have to update all of the
users so all of the examples in the kernel are consistent.
I might just need to do that anyway, but...
