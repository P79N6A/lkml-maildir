It was a fairly soft reservation of space, and we never actually tried
to use it all.
I don't see a clear problem with just making the change you mention,
but until I have thought through the implications (or until someone
else has and convinces me) I don't feel comfortable making the change.
It's on my todo list, but that doesn't promise a lot :-(
If someone else wants to try to convince me it is safe, and mention
tcp window sizes a couple of time, I'll probably be happy with it.
