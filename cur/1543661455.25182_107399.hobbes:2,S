By strange co-incidence I saw this with natsemi on one of my boxes
today.

Our drivers post buffers larger than an ethernet packet to the card so
it means the card thinks it received a frame larger than anything it
should have accepted.

If it got stuck in a loop the box would hang. It appears to stop the
chip and it never restarts.
My card that did this is also an FA-311. I've only ever seen this once
however so I guess my network isnt loaded enough 8)
