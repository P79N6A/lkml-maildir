with the size of drives today is it really that bad to require a seperate 
partition for this?
I also don't like the idea of storing this in the swap partition for a couple of 
reasons.
1. on many modern linux systems the swap partition is not large enough.
for example, on my boxes with 16G or ram I only allocate 2G of swap space
2. it's too easy for other things to stomp on your swap partition.
   for example: booting from a live CD that finds and uses swap partitions
if you are needing space for your freeze, allocate it in an unabigous way, not 
by re-useing an existing partition.
