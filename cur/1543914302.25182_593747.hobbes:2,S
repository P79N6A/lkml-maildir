To avoid this window, typically one creates a temporary directory first,
with 0700 permissions.  Make sure you verify that you actually created
the directory, and watch out for symlink attacks.  Then you create the
file in that directory.
This doesn't prevent another process owned by the same user (or root)
from attaching, but such a process can ptrace you or touch yoour /proc
spaec just as well, so you're screwed anyway (modulo SELinux-type policies.)

This link talks about file flags handling.  I don't see the relevance to
this problem at all.  However, this is a very long thread, so if there
is anything specific that you want to point to, then please elucidate.

Yup, see above.
