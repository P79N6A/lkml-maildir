Hi,
I wanted to change the scsi disk spinuptime timeout. (I currently have
a disk that refuses to spinup, unless you tell it to do so repeatedly). 
I had expected to have to change a #defined constant somewhere, but
it turns out that the constant 100 was embedded into the code. 
Anyway, I went "all the way" and made it a configuration option.
Does anybody have objections to this?
				Roger.

+SCSI disk spinup time
+CONFIG_SCSI_SD_SPINUPTIME
+  Some SCSI disks can be jumpered not to start until the computer
+  tells it to. This sets the time that the kernel will wait before
+  giving up on a drive. Usually a drive will report "ready" well
+  before this, but if you have a misbehaving disk, you can alter the
+  timeout here. It is best to leave this at 100 unless you know what
