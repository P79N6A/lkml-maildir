Hello Nick,
   what's the reason behind disallowing get_user_pages() on VM_RESERVED regions? 
  vmmon uses VM_RESERVED on its 'vma' as otherwise some kernels used by SUSE 
complained loudly about mismatch between PageReserved() and VM_RESERVED flags.
   I'll remove it from vmmon for >= 2.6.14 kernels as that bogus test never made 
to Linux kernel, but I cannot find any reason why get_user_pages() should not 
work on VM_RESERVED (or VM_IO for that matter) user pages.  Can you show me 
reasoning behind that decision ?
							Thanks,
								Petr Vandrovec
