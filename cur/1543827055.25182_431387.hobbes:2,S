We have discussed this before and there is a comment in the patch:
+ *
+ * Some processors have inc/dec instructions that are atomic vs an interrupt.
+ * However, the code must first determine the differential location in a zone
+ * based on the processor number and then inc/dec the counter. There is no

+ * in between and therefore the atomicity vs. interrupt cannot be exploited

+void __inc_zone_page_state(struct page *page, enum zone_stat_item item)
+{
+       struct zone *zone = page_zone(page);
+       s8 *p = diff_pointer(zone, item);
+
+       (*p)++;
+
+       if (unlikely(*p > STAT_THRESHOLD)) {
+               zone_page_state_add(*p, zone, item);
+               *p = 0;
+       }
+}
AFAIK the restrictions on local_t use are such that is barely usable.
