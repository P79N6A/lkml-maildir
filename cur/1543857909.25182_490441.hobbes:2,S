Well, we should mark the argument const too, no?
Does anythign actually improve from this? Also, we should actually use 
"__attribute_const__" instead (which works with other compilers), not the 
gcc'ism. That "__attribute__((const))" thing is a horrible syntax anyway 
(and has apparently slipped into <linux/log2.h> too - Damn.
