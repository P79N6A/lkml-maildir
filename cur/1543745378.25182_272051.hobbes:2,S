Fortunately, I don't anybody who writes such a crap. The
example you gave here misses a space after 'hello' and
the only way to see it is to put the cursor at the end
of the line. That's why doing this is wrong. It's a
good thing that recent gcc explicitly forbids such
usages, it will force people to fix their code. The
correct way of doing it should be :
const char * msg = "hello "
                   "world";

Could you please retest with -Os. I've noticed
that starting from about gcc-3.2, code optimized
for speed tended to increase in size (eventhough
sometimes becoming slower). However, code optimized
for size (-Os) clearly reduced its size at the
expense of speed which sometimes fell dramatically.
