I got confused there.
I agree that if we can do a -good- job of it, then an implicit,
automatic solution is better for the problem of reducing sched domain
partition sizes on large systems than yet another manual knob.
But I thought that it was good idea, with general agreement, to provide
an explicit control of isolated cpus for the real-time folks, even if
under the covers it use sched domain partitions of size 1 to implement
it.
