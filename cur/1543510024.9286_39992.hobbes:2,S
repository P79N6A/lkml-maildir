Nod.
I have three source files dedicated to the "kernel ABI tables".  I don't
have pure tables yet, because some of the kernel ABI is complex and
beyond my table-modelling ability.
E.g. the "fcntl" system call uses entirely different memory regions
depending on its second argument and I have some code to figure that out.
And the last time I checked my ioctl table, there were 927 lines in it.
This makes three separate projects that need the same information:
    strace
    my trace-and-replay debugger
    your virtual kernel
I would be interested in your "basic C types".
Also next week I am making a tarball of my stuff (nothing fancy).
Michael
