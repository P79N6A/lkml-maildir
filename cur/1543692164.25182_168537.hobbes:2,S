	Thanks for a dose of desinf^D^D^D^D^D^Denlightenment, Larry.
	Seriously, someone whom Linus have entrusted his revision control
 needs, should be a bit more objective, to say the least.
	In this way Linus is going to keep telling things like:
> Andrea - please just shut up.

	_quite_ for some time...
	BTW i really doubt you are so badly informed on Arch progress,
 since it is you most close competitor.
	And, as the last note, if Linus was at least somewhat interested
 in replacing bk with something less community-irritating, he could
 do google queries like that more often:
	google://"revision control" "distributed development"
	Guess what? Arch is on the _first_ hit.
cheers, Samium Gromoff
