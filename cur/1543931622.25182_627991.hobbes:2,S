Could be.  Hans' machine on bug 9320 is the affected one (PATA on via
CN700).  I asked him to test the final version.  If it indeed is caused
by the same problem, there won't be evaluation failures.
Anyways, table-based implementations like the NVidia and VIA ones are
bound to fail on certain conditions.  libata reconfigures transfer mode
aggressively under certain failure conditions and _GTM invocation will
fail if the port is in a mode which is not on ACPI's mode table (which
doesn't seem to be too comprehensive anyway).  So, there's always
possibility of _GTM failure for those boards, which in turn can fail
_GTF evaluation.
As _GTM, _STM and _GTF aren't strictly necessary for operation anyway, I
think it's better to print ATA ACPI evaluation failure messages using
KERN_DEBUG.
Thanks.
