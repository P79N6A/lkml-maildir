 Jamie> Patch: ia64-pgtable-2.6.5.patch
 Jamie> That mixture of PAGE_* and __pgprot() definitions for the __[PS]*
 Jamie> macros in asm-ia64/pgtable.h is really ugly and just makes the code
 Jamie> unnecessarily confusing:
 Jamie> #define __P000  PAGE_NONE
 Jamie> #define __P001  PAGE_READONLY
 Jamie> #define __P010  PAGE_READONLY
 Jamie> #define __P011  PAGE_READONLY
 Jamie> #define __P100  __pgprot(__ACCESS_BITS | _PAGE_PL_3 | _PAGE_AR_X_RX)
 Jamie> #define __P101  __pgprot(__ACCESS_BITS | _PAGE_PL_3 | _PAGE_AR_RX)
 Jamie> #define __P110  PAGE_COPY
 Jamie> #define __P111  PAGE_COPY
 Jamie> The PAGE_* macros which are used in __[PS]* aren't used
 Jamie> anywhere else: their entire reason for existing is to make the
 Jamie> __[PS]* macros clearer.  It looks as though the people who
 Jamie> implemented the IA-64 port didn't realise that.
Huh?  You haven't actually checked, have you?
I don't pollute namespace for no good reason.
 Jamie> Here is a page (untested) which cleans up those definitions.
 Jamie> It was made from 2.6.5.
If the same names are adopted by the other platforms, I'm fine with it.
Otherwise, see my comment above.
