I didn't see the machine spending any time idle when I ran Lincoln's
test so I'm not sure what's going on there.  But the pthread thing
is surely the reason why the profiles are showing time in sched_yield().
What I *did* see was 2.5 spending too much time doing pointless work
in readahead (it's in cache already, stop doing that!).  And also
generic_file_llseek() bouncing i_sem around like a ping-pong ball.
Fixing those things up bought 10%.

Yes sorry, but I find testing -aa is a bit of a pain.  It's such a
big patch, I'd really need to start a new branch for it.
