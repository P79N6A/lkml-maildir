Subject: is it expected behaviour to receive one's own broadcast messages?

I have an app that is sending out broadcast messages to the local network using 
255.255.255.255.  It is registered for INADDR_ANY.  The thing that seems strange 
is that it receives a copy of every packet that it sends out.  Is this expected?
The kernel is 2.4.18.
Thanks,
Chris
