Ok, I updated to 2.6.11.8, and indeed it does have problems that
weren't there before - although in my case it can't mount the root
partition because it's not quite ready yet.  In part, it seems to be
caused by the fact that the USB start up sequence introduces a new
thread that delays the scsi_host_scan by 5 seconds, which is long
enough to cause problems.  I added some code to wait for not only the
disk name to be online, but the partition, but even that doesn't seem
to be quite enough.
Is there anyplace generic that could be hooked that will report when a
device is actually online and ready to run?  Perhaps I was just lucky
in the past with add_disk :-/
Ciao,
