Seems to be going up when under load, and down when idle, so I suppose
it's working :)  The clock is only a little jittery, but not more than
I'd expect across the network, so it looks like it's keeping time okay.
Would it be possible to determine whether the system will wake to the
APIC interrupt at system boot, rather than hardcoded in the config?
After you explained the problem, I noticed that creating my own
interrupts (holding down a key on the keyboard for example) kept the
system moving and not slow.  For example, something like this (sorry, I
don't know the code well enough yet to attempt to code it myself):
set the APIC timer to fire in X
set another timer/interrupt to fire in 2X
wait for the interrupt
if (time_elapsed >= 2X) disable the APIC timer
else APIC timer should work
Or, determine which timer woke us up, etc.
Thanks,
Frank
