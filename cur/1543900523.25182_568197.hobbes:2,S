OK, so does that mean we can finally get the block_page_mkwrite
patches merged?
i.e.:

http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=117426070111136&w=2
I've got up-to-date versions of them ready to go and they've been
consistently tested thanks to the XFSQA test I wrote for the bug
that it fixes. I've been holding them out-of-tree for months now
because ->fault was supposed to supercede this interface.....
Cheers,
Dave.
