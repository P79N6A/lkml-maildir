 But, surely those of us who bisect against linus' tree only
care about the commits which made it into his tree, and in the
context of whatever else was in _his_ tree at the time ?
 Maybe I'm under a misapprehension about changesets and merges.  I
thought a merge was just pulling in a series of changesets, and that
each changeset only contains related items (comment, changed lines,
added files, deleted files).
 Whatever else may be in tree E, I don't expect it to have a commit
which changes $EXTRAVERSION, purely because tree E is not Linus'
tree.  To me, that field is somewhat special - it indicates where I am
(e.g. if bisecting across multiple rcs, or even across multiple
releases) and it determines where the modules will go.
 I see from Linus' reply to the original mail that this is indeed
normal.  That certainly isn't the word I would choose to use : we
give things names to describe them and in this case the EXTRAVERSION
appears to inhabit a parrallel universe to the pre-existing usage
of "2.6.24 good, 2.6.25-rc1 bad".   Colour me more confused than ever.
