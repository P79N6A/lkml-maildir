Hello,
first thanks for your great support on the Linux kernel.
I have a problem with kernel 2.4.28 and maybe somebody has an idea about my problem. When I type dmesg, I get this error messages:
__alloc_pages: 0-order allocation failed (gfp=0x1d2/0)
VM: killing process python
For any kind of reason a python script is killed.
What this kind of error message means?
Is this the memory killer? This would mean that maybe I have a memory leak in the python script?
Best regards,
saf
