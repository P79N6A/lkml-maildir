I'm sure you know all this already but I'll spell it out so we're all
clear:
a) rlimits are tracked per-process so they're fundamentally
per-process
b) there are hard and soft limits, with soft always <= hard
c) only root can raise hard rlimits, but normal users can lower them
d) if a user owns a process, he can gain the privileges of that process
by various means, so in the strict sense per-process privileges are
meaningless - all privileges are per-uid
e) so we either need to segregate all privileged processes into
separate uid domains
f) or we're assuming non-malicious users and soft limits are
sufficient.
Now I suspect we don't want to insist people do (e) (though I'd
certainly encourage them to try).
Don't forget that the rlimits approach allows us to reserve the
highest priorities for root. I'm pretty sure an effective watchdog
policy can thus be implemented in userspace, which RT-LSM can't really
offer.
