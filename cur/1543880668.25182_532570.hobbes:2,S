No, drvdata belongs to driver that is bound to a device. We are
talking about private data created and managed by driver that provides
device.

Again, if we are talking about driver bound to a device then devices
->release() is irrelevant. If we are talking about driver that created
device then driver's ->remove() is irrelevant.

What other thread? I suppose it is module-local thread or
subsystem-local thread. Let's that particular subsystem take care of
it's own data and use its own ->release() when it is ready. What I
mean is there is no need to perform clean-up at once; every layer can
do its own cleanup.

This is up to subsystem to ensure that it does not access dead devices.

Which ones? These needs to be identified and treated with "immediate
disconnect" that you advocated earlier. Once active users of device's
services are gone you can zap it.
