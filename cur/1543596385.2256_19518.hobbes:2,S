I just installed 2.4.6, and turned ACPI on (and APM off).  On startup, APCI
reports "Power button: found" twice.  Also, in /proc/acpi/button there are
two directories named "power".
acpid is able to see the events properly, tho, and shutdown the computer.
This is a Tyan 1598S motherboard running an AMD K6-II 500MHz.  Will test
code to help get this fixed. :)
