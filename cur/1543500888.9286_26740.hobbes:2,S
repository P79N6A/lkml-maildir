Actually lseek looks at the file size -- that's all.

No problem.  There's only one inode it has to lock.

Can you describe the problem?
Remember that this happens in filps only -- non-filp operations like
mkdir, rename etc. don't see it.
This is what I think happens:
   sys_open
-> lookup_dentry
-> lookup_dentry(dentry, "default")
-> store 1st in filp->dentry_for_readdir
-> store 2nd in filp->dentry
   sys_close
... nearly as now but an additional release() call if
    dentry != dentry_for_readdir.
But I must admit, the role of filp->f_op is not too clear here.
Perhaps f_op_for_readdir is required too.

Ahem, oh _that_ stuff ;-)
Now I definitely prefer proposal 2: filp has two dentries.
If there are no locking problems.
It's done the filp layer, created by open() -- renaming, mkdir,
creat and so on don't see this stuff.
sys_rename() would simply rename the directory and everything works.
Your wonderful code handles directory renames just fine.
sys_unlink() is icky -- but ok from the kernel's point of view.  It
would return EISDIR since you've given it the name of a directory.
Arguably it should recursively delete the directory tree -- to give
the appearance of deleting a structured file.  Arguably it shouldn't.
create() -- what problem?
Another happy thought from...
