I can't. I'm in a different OS community, FreeBSD, and I deal with issues
related to threading systems there. There's many variables that could be
at play for various performance categories.

The JVM itself can has a habit of really stretching the amount of resources
available in many areas and fringe logic in commonly used systems. I can't
really say what the problems are until the Blackdown folks start integrating
the new threading model and then start testing it.
However, there is a mutex fast path in the code itself that can be optionally
used in place of the the OS back version. They felt it was significant to do
the work for that for some reason, so I'm just going to assume that this is
important until otherwise noted.
