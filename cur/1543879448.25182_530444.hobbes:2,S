Device lifetime vs. module lifetime - that's a fun one...

What I see that a device driver may do now is the following:
- disallow module unloading (duh)
- move the release function outside the module
To make the completion approach work, the complete() would need to be
after the release function. This would imply an upper layer, but this
upper layer would need to access the completion structure in the
module...
One could think about a owner field (for getting/putting the module
reference) for the object (with a final module_put() after the release
function has been called). The problem there would be that it would
preclude unloading of the module if there isn't a "self destruct" knob
for the object.
