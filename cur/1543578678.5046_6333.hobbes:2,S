I get "Unknown device 24" when I try booting Kernel 2.4.0 (and it has been 
like this on all 2.4-test kernels too).
When I had my Plextor Plexwriter 8/2/20 CD-ROM attached it didn't even find 
my hard drive (Quantum Atlas 10K).
I have a Adaptec 29160N scsi card.
I've had some problems with 2.2.x too, sometimes it doesn't boot (time out 
and stuff like that on the scsi probing).
I have previously posted about this and none obviously cared, hope 
something will happen this time since I guess Adaptec 29160N + Quantum 
Atlas 10K would be a quite common combination. Anyone with the same 
hardware setup that would like to comment please mail me at 
andreas.henriksson@linux.se since I'm not on the linux-kernel mailing list. 
Comments would be appreciated.
Oh, by the way. Someone posted a patch for this that wasn't accepted. 
Reason: "It wasn't needed". (Although the patch didn't solve my second 
problem, the one with the cd-rom attached... still didn't find my hard 
drive). He/she had a Compaq something that also had problem booting. The 
patch was really just a 2.2.x rip off that added a few lines.
Ahh... still have it .. it's attached.
It probably won't apply cleanly but it's not that hard to do it manually. 
Better someone else fix it and resubmit it I'll probably just screw it up 
anyway. ;)
This patch was _not_ written by me, I don't really know what it does, and 
it doesn't solve the problem completely. (Booting 2.2.x isn't 100% reliable 
for me either, works most of the time though.)
I hope my english is understandable.
