Ugh. You do this?
And you don't realize that the whole system is too broken for words?
What is the horrible app that does something like this? 
The fix, I think, is to make the ioctl commands much more regular. That is
probably true in general, and fixing that would hopefully fix the need for
horrible code like the above.

doesn't look horrible, and I don't see why we couldn't expose the "driver
name" for any file descriptor. We already do for some: "fstatfs()" is
largely the same thing on another level.
