You might be able to scan fdsets quickly at the user level but
internally select has to scan the list and call the check routine
for every interesting descriptor. I've been working on the kernel
implementation of select/poll and can tell you that if a one
descriptor select takes 40-50 *micro*seconds a 1000 descriptor
select will be up in the region of 8-10 *milli*seconds (on my
6x86 P150+).[1]
  The current select/poll implementation can be improved significantly,
especially in the blocking case, but the overhead will still increase
with the number of descriptors because select/poll does not, and
cannot, remember what descriptors are interesting. This would be
easy to fix with a new API. Suggestions are welcome - particularly
from people who might actually be interested in using it in earnest.
