Nack.  Not unless you update the documentation and explanations
properly.
The important part is that we stop assigning binary numbers.  You
are removing part of the description of why we can not assign bianry
numbers and how that is important.
CTL_UNNUMBERED may be an irritant to you but as for actually using the
code I have look and it is about 6 of 1 half dozen of the other.
