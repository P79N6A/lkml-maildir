Hi,
OK, I finally spent some time studying the timer code and am starting 
to grasp it.  I think I finally understand the bug.  Andrea's timer->lock 
patch will fix it for 2.4 and everybody says it can't happen in 2.6 so
ok.

Yes.

Or do that instead, yes.

I see the bug in 2.4.

I don't know enough about how 2.6 works to say, 
but here's more detail on what happened in 2.4:
cpu 0                                              cpu 3
-------                                          ---------
                                      previously,  timer->base = cpu 3 base
                                          (its task-struct->real_timer)
bh_action() {
__run_timers() {                          sys_setitimer() {
  it_real_fn() // called as fn()              del_timer_sync() {
    add_timer() {                               spinlock (cpu3 base)
      spinlock (cpu0 base)
        timer->base = cpu0 base                    detach_timer (timer)
          list_add(&timer->list)
                                                   timer->list.next = NULL;
  and now timer is vectored in but can't be unlinked.
And so either of Andrea's fixes should fix this race.
