Quite a big part of -mm are git trees of maintainers.
Where are they in your tool?
And I still don't think your tool would make sense.
But hey, simply try it - that's the only way for you to prove me wrong.
People said similar things about the 2.6.16 kernel or my regression 
tracking, and I simply did it.

Patch dependencies and patch conflicts will be the interesting parts 
when you will implement this.
E.g. new fancy filesystem patch in -mm might depend on some VFS change 
that requires changes to all other filesystems.
I'm really looking forward to see how you will implement this for 
something like -mm with > 1000 patches (many of them git trees that 
themselves contain many different patches) without offloading all the 
additional work to the kernel developers.

No.
Forcing people to use some tool (no matter whether it's Bugzilla or
the PTS you want to implement) is 100% a social problem involving humans.

For getting people to use your tool, you will have to convince them that 
using your tool will bring them real benefits.

I doubt the placing of some Acked-By- tags in patches is really what 
is killing Andrews time.
How does Andrew check the status of 1500 patches in -mm in your PTS?
And how do you implement the use case that Andrew forwards a batch of
200 patches to Linus? How does the information from your tool come into git?
But hey, write your tool and convince Andrew of it's advantages if you 
don't believe me.

Spamming people who have some hardware with information about patches 
won't bring you anything. You need people willing to test patches that 
won't bring them any benefit - and if you have such people they are 
usually as well willing to simply regularly test -rc kernels.

Why not?

Did Linus state he would actually actively use a Debian BTS?
If not, then there's no advantage.

There's a difference between a discussion email and a control message in

How do people sell and buy goods at eBay?
eBay has a "do everything through the web interface plus notification 
emails" quite similar to Bugzilla.
Or Wikis?
Or Blogs?
