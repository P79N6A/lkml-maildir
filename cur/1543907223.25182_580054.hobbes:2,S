It's usable now. The issue with policies only occurs if the user specifies
kernelcore= or movablecore= on the command-line. Your language suggests
that you believe policies are not applied when ZONE_MOVABLE is configured
at build-time.

Saying it breaks NUMA is a excessively strong language. It doesn't break
policies in that they still get applied to the highest zone. If kernelcore=
or movablecore= is not specified, the behaviour doesn't change.

The better solution in my mind is to always filter the zonelist instead
of applying them only for MPOL_BIND zonelists as the hack does.
