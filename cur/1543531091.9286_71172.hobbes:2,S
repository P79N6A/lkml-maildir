And no MMU and no swap space. They will never go OOS. No paging.
No processes killer. And why processes? Why a scheduler?
Besides that, why any embedded device should be optimized for high 
multitasking - multiuser - general purpose workloads? That's what 
"overcommitting" is for. That's what (vanilla) Linux is designed for.
Many parts of it are not well suited for embedded systems. They are not
designed for them.
