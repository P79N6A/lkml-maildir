Yes, the patch fixes s2ram without acpi_skip_timer_override for me (x86_64).
There is, however, one difference during boot that may be a hint:
When booting without acpi_skip_timer_override the following message appears:
MP-BIOS bug: 8254 timer not connected to IO-APIC
As a sidenote booting without enable_timer_pin_1 doesn't make any
difference as expected.
