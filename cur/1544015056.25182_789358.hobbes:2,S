I'm also back (temporarily), and they're not quite going to work for  
powerpc, either, but it shouldn't be anything major to fix, and since  
it didn't work on powerpc before, that shouldn't hold anything up.   
I'm working on getting things working for me again now.   
Unfortunately, it now looks like I'm going to have to be out of the  
office next week, but I expect to get something out as soon as I'm  
back, if I don't get a chance to fix it today.
Jeremy, many thanks for your work merging my patches in with your  
series!
Cheers,
Becky
