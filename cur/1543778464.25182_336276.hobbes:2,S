Can you please look into why it spits out a lot of erros when selecting:
Configure standard kernel features under the General ssetup menu.
I dunno if it did that before since I cannot run the stock gconfig

And please enable the nicer icons. If for no other reason than at least to
make someone else update xconfig.
