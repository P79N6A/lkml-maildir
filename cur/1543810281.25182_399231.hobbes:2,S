Hi Vojtech,
I wondered why numlock LED goes off during boot process, even though I ask 
BIOS to turn on;
atkbd.c
/*
 * If the get ID command failed, we check if we can at least set the LEDs on
 * the keyboard. This should work on every keyboard out there. It also turns
 * the LEDs off, which we want anyway.
 */
                param[0] = 0;
                if (ps2_command(ps2dev, param, ATKBD_CMD_SETLEDS))
                        return -1;
What is the rationale *why* we want LEDS off anyway?
Thanks,
Nick
