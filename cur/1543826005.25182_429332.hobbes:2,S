Yes. I agree with you.

I think that list would be very useful. But as you said, there are
other steps remaining than ones I came up with at once. I can't
deal with the steps of all of them...
BTW, Section 3 says "Before you do anything with the device you've
found, you need to enable it by calling pci_enable_device()...". I
think it would be one of the causes of misunderstanding the order
between pci_request_regions() and pci_enable_device().
