We use fibrechannel here, which is quite high performance, and does
present a SCSI interface.   
For other devices, such has single-board hardware raid solutions, 
other ways of doing raw character disk I/O will need to be 
devised (e.g. the hba/driver for DPT millenium or DAC960 need to
register the appropriate character special device and provide
file_operations to handle the I/O). 
Or sct's /dev/raw could be used (where I/O requests
will be broken up into uniform chunks rather single requests
being sent to the host bus adapter).
