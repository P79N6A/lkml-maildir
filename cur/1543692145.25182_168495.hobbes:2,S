I've reproduced this problem. It's a bug in the configuration
system which triggers when you change an option which has
derived options.
In this case, when first configuring for a CPU with TSC the
derived CONFIG_X86_TSC option is added. Then when reconfiguring
for a TSC-less CPU (e.g., 486) the derived option stays because
it derived from something that _was_ defined at the start of the
config run.
The workaround is to do an additional 'make oldconfig', after
which the derived option will be gone.
