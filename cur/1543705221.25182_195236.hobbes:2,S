When should this be done?
I have 2.6.1 + the 2.6.1-specific patches + core patches.  It suspends
  without difficulty, but on boot, it says it couldn't read a part
  of the resume data (a "chunk", iirc).  The status bar doesn't make
  much progress.
I tried hdparm -W 0 right before the call to hibernate (in a script).
  But I still have the problem.
When should hdparm be called?
Thanks!
