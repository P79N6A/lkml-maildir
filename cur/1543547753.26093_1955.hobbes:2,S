Hi,
Just a heads up.  I've reverted to test7, I was getting wierd things
happening with test8-pre4.  Like I lost 90% of the messages in my
inbox.  It isn't that Pine/BUGTRAQ thing as I'm using mutt, and I'm
not subscribed to bugtraq.
Also I loaded a page off slashdot - the interview with Kernighan - and
the images were the right size but just binary junk.  Had to right
click and do "view image", then they were OK.
I shutdown and rebooted after that, and that's when the inbox problem
occurred.
No error messages/oopses to report...
Jon.
PS I'm not subscribed from this address so if there's something that
needs my immediate attention, please cc: me.Hi,
