Subject: [PATCH] use unlikely() for current_kernel_time() loop
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hello,
I just noticed this minor optimization.  current_kernel_time() is called
from current_fs_time() so it is used fairly often but it doesn't use
unlikely(read_seqretry(&xtime_lock, seq)) as other users of xtime_lock do.
Also removes extra whitespace on the empty line above.
