Sorry for the late reply.
Well I think I reported this or another swap/tmpfs performance issue earlier ( 
http://marc.info/?t=116542915700004&r=1&w=2
 ), we got the suggestion to increase /proc/sys/vm/page-cluster to 5, but we never came around to try it.
Maybe this was the reason for my report to be almost entirely ignored, sorry for that.
Regards,
Magnus
