These are great improvements.  Thanks.

Yeah.  When I originally wrote it, I thought using the LSb was cute,
and avoided an extra variable.  Your way is simpler and provides
the extra feature of disabling the preset from the command line.
This, and the elimination of ifdefs is quite nice.

It's hard to imagine this case, but that would merely result in
a calibration, right?  For a machine that slow, calibrating the
delay is the least of their worries. :-)

I hadn't considered this.  (Too much "embedded" on the brain.)
By help text, do you mean the config text, or something on the wiki page,
or some other file (in Documentation?).
On the subject of help text, is there a Documentation file I should modify
or someone I should notify about the addition of a new kernel command line
option?

I had it there originally, then changed my mind.  I know some server
guys are interested in fastboot.  This particular change might not
be that interesting, but some of the other changes we are thinking of
might not be specific to just embedded.
I will do some runtime testing on your patch, but I probably won't be
able to report back until Monday.
Thanks very much!
