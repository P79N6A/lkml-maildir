It's quite a lot of tricky code, and fairly high maintenance, I expect.
I'd have _thought_ that distros and their high-end customers would be
interested in it, but I haven't noticed anything from them.  Not that
this means much - our processes for gathering this sort of information
are rudimentary at best.  Has your team been in contact with distros?
Are Suse shipping it, or planning to?
(cc's a few more distro people)
Guys, could you please wander over to the appropriate cube and
administer a prod?
Thanks.
