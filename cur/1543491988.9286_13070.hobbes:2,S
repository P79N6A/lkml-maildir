I am having problems with a BSDI 4.0 server (nfs server) and a 
Dual Pen II 400 with 512 MB RAM running RedHat 5.2 with kernel
2.2.5 as a nfs client. 
The linux machine is a web server running apache  1.3.6. Everything a
CGI on the web server writes something to a file on the BSDI machine I
get corrupted data. Random numbers garbage etc.
Please someone help me out here everything else seems ok.
