All the above refers to well-behaved applications.
Now think about how the syscalls which you provide may be used by
applications which are *designed* to cripple or to compromise the machine.

I'm referring to an application which uses your syscalls to obtain pinned
memory and uses munlock() so that it may then use your syscalls to obtain
evem more pinned memory.  With the objective of taking the machine down.

kinda.  But applications can undo the mlock which the kernel did.

I haven't even thought about memory hotswap.  Surely it'll fail if the
pages are pinned by get_user_pages()?
