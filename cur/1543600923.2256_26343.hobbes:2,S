But see my post in this thread where I created a simple test to show that, 
even when we pre-read *all* the inodes in a directory, there is no great 
performance win.
Thinking about it some more, I can see that some optimization is possible for 
the 20% or so of the work that was devoted to reading in the inodes, but such 
optimization has the nature of physical readahead in the inode table.  Which 
would apply equally well to the file data itself.
