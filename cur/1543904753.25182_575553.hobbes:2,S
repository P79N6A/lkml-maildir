I mean if we also have a block extent tree between fsblock and the
filesystem's get_block (which I think could be a good idea).
So you would use that tree to find the block extent that you're in,
then use the pagecache tree dirty tag lookup from the start of that
block extent (or you could add a backward tag lookup if you just wanted
to gather a small range around the given offset). I think (haven't got
any code for this yet, mind you).

Hmm, OK you're probably right. I'll have to see how it looks.
