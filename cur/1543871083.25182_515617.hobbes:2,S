I agree with the criticism, dislike the snarly comments, and disagree
with this patch.
VDSO is only a problem if (1) the hypervisor wants to reserve the top
virtual address space (CONFIG_PARAVIRT=y), and (2) the glibc is old and
can't handle a VDSO mapped anywhere but 0xFFFFE000
(CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO=y).
Now, KVM wants to use CONFIG_PARAVIRT=y but not reserve_top_address(),
so we should split the config option.  Let's not get too excited because
we kept it simple.  Patch (untested, but fairly simple) below.
BTW, I had a patch to do a runtime test (old glibc causes init to
assert, then disable vdso and try again): everyone hated it.
