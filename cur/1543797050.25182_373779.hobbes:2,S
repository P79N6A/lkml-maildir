I think you mean 'standby'?

You are hitting something else than missing 4MB pages:
static inline int
arch_prepare_suspend(void)
{
        /* If you want to make non-PSE machine work, turn off paging
           in swsusp_arch_suspend. swsusp_pg_dir should have identity
mapping, so
           it could work...  */
        if (!cpu_has_pse) {
                printk(KERN_ERR "PSE is required for swsusp.\n");
                return -EPERM;
        }
        return 0;
}
...so just insert printks into the code to find out what is going on...
