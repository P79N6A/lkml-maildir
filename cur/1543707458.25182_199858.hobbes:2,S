Thankfully, I have no control over SGI's tree but if you have any
pending improvements for the generic ia64 portions, I'd certainly be
happy to take (another) look.  I really didn't (and still don't)
remember of there being anything pending in this area.  Not entirely
surprising though: I'm quite easy to satisfy as far as the PCI
subsystem goes (if it works, I'm happy ;-).
