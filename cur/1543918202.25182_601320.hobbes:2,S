Subject: [PATCH 4/5] Revert lguest magic and use hook in head.S
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/2/365

Version 2.07 of the boot protocol uses 0x23C for the hardware_subarch
field, that for lguest is "1".  This allows us to use the standard
boot entry point rather than the "GenuineLguest" string hack.
This entry point also clears the BSS and copies the boot parameters
and commandline for us, saving more code.
