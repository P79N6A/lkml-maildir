I was hoping the context from the original TODO up there was sufficient
and it looked like it was enough.
TD's are around 32 bytes big (actually, they may be 48 or even 64 now, I
haven't checked recently). That's a waste of space for an entire page.
However, having every driver implement it's own slab cache seems a
complete waste of time when we already have the code to do so in
mm/slab.c. It would be nice if we could extend the generic slab code to
understand the PCI DMA API for us.

Not really. The 2 interesting architectures are x86 and ia64 since
that's where you commonly see UHCI controllers. While you can add UHCI
controllers to most any other architecture which has PCI, you usually
see OHCI on those systems.
I was curious to see if any other architectures implemented it
differently and I was just expecting too much out of the API. You pretty
much confirmed my suspicions when you suggested doing what the tulip
driver does.
