Subject: semantics past EOF for MAP_PRIVATE and MAP_SHARED...

There's a chunky comment near the beginning of filemap_nopage() that after a test and then following the source seems to me to be untrue:
	/*
	 * Semantics for shared and private memory areas are different
	 * past the end of the file. A shared mapping past the last page
	 * of the file is an error and results in a SIGBUS, while a
	 * private mapping just maps in a zero page.
	 */
I tried to read past on a MAP_PRIVATE and got a sigbus and the source seems to suggest no differentiation from MAP_SHARED in this respect.
What are the `correct' semantics?
