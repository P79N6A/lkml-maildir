Version e17 of the Class-based Kernel Resource Management
is now available for download from
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=85838&package_id=94608
The major updates since the previous version include:
1. Numerous bugfixes
2. Control over rate of process forks through the numtasks controller.
The rate of forking is a single systemwide parameter affecting all 
classes. Existing share-based control over total number of forks allowed 
per class remains the same.
3. Interface change: The "target" file has been removed from the RCFS 
interface. The same functionality can now be obtained by writing to the 
"members" file of any class.
Files released:
ckrm-e17.2610.patch
	Combined patch against 2.6.10. Includes the numtasks and 		 
listenaq controllers.
e17-incr.tar.bz2
	Tarball of broken down patches. First 10 patches constitute
	the e16 release and subsequent ones contain the updates since
	then.
cpu.ckrm-e17.v10.patch
	CPU controller.
Still to come:
memory controller
I/O controller
test packages
Please note that updates to CKRM based on the feedback from lkml on
the previous release (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/11/29/152
) are in 
progress and will be included in the next release.
Testing and feedback welcome.
