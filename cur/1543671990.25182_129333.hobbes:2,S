The base, shown in the definition in scanf() does not have any
correlation to the names of the internal variables used. The
current code, correctly uses the base of 10 when %d, %u, %l, and
all the other decimal variants are encountered, and correctly
uses base octal when %o is encountered, and correctly uses
base 16 when %x or its variations are encountered. The only
known problem is not a problem with base, but a problem with
scanning  the string because the standard allows 0x to preceed
a hexadecimal number.
Kevin Corry <kevcorry@us.ibm.com>, submitted a patch which breaks
already working code in an aparent attempt to fix the leading
"0x" problem.
