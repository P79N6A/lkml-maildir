Hi !
Looks good, but you could do even better :) I still want to look at the
proper mecanism to flush the CPU cache on 970, but the idea here is to
flush it, and put the CPU into a NAP loop (the 970 has no SLEEP mode)
with the caches clean and MSR:EE off. We can later get it back with a
soft reset.
Ben.
