Sure... but he's hard-coding 1.44 MB format.  This behaviour is also 
quite common on for example USB drives; it is simply no longer correct 
to expect the BIOS to reject invalid CHS geometries (if the underlying 
drive is really an LBA drive most if not all BIOSes will simply apply 
the conversion algorithm without limit checks.)
Can we please retire bootsect.S and get on with our lives?  This thing 
is becoming a millstone around our necks!
(For those that don't know, there is no way to determine the CHS 
geometry of floppy media from the BIOS.  The "get geometry" call on a 
floppy drive returns what the drive is capable of, not what the current 
medium is using.  DOS and its relatives don't care, since a FAT 
filesystem includes the CHS geometry in the superblock.)
