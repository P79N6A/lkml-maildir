Given that the current, sole purpose of sys_poll() is to implement the 
poll(2)
system call, and that currently, that system call takes a 32 bit signed 
integer
third argument, then it seems safe to me to just ignore the top 32 
bits.  They
can be either masked off explicitly or implicitly via the use of a 32 bit
signed integer.
Is there a problem with making this change other than it is a change?  Is
there a risk of something breaking?
    Thanx...
