Yes, that happens to me too regularly. Also now my bios completely
freezes after having successfully done the dmi pool check at boot if I
try to boot directly from my HD, so I have to boot from my usb dvd
writer. At the moment I successfully booted that rescuecd in 64 bit
mode and the kexeced into my 2.6.27.8 debian system. I still haven't
tried to make a bootable cd with grub and see if I can also boot
directly into my HD at boot or if not even Grub can see it. The very
good point of using the kexec method is that, even if my bios cannot
boot my hd directly, I can bypass it. But I still don't know if I have
this problem too.
