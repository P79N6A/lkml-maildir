Correct. LCD class was never used by anyone.

   Ug. Previously it did the selecting for you. If you selected 
backlight support the fbdev backlight would just come to life. This caused 
problems for the case of having ACPI backlight and a fbdev driver with 
backlight support. Two drivers controling the same hardware is not the
greatest idea. I made it so that people explictly had to pick the backlight
with a fbdev device. The other reason for this change was not every 
one is using a LCD display. I have a system at home that uses a CRT. 
   Plus their is the case of "standard" PC graphics cards being used 
in embedded devices. In this case even tho the graphics card has backlight 
support the external lcd/backlight is routed through gpio independent of 
the embedded graphics card. In such case we don't want to enable the
backlight for the graphics card but enable it.
    In a nut shell the solution is select the backlight support for your
fbdev driver if you need it.
