Subject: PATCH: serial patch for PPC
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

	Adding serial support for machines that don't have any rs ports
causes a panic [panic("Couldn't register serial driver\n");], this causes
a problem with making "common" PowerPC kernels, because prep/chrp do have
these (right?) and PowerMacs do not.  Below is a proposed patch to fix
this problem, should this be the right way to get around the panic?  also,
i moved show_serial_version() to *after* the driver has been registered,
which sounded to me like the proper way.
please cc me to any replies as i do not subsribe to this ilst, thanks!
ani
