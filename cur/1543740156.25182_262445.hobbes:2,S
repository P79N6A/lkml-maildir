In a way patch helped to track down the error: while compiling 
new kernel[*] I was hit by SEGFAULT, so I ran memtest.... 
Well, it's not new RAM, so it goes away now, and I will give 
a plain 2.6.9 next try.
[*] I compiled -rc4 and -final (well, even twice) not so long
    ago and everythig was fine those days. :/

Thanks for explanation. I will apply workaround in case
of 'mysterious' corruption reappear.
BTW, could it be, that CONFIG_REGPARM makes problem visible with
     your compiler (somehow)?
