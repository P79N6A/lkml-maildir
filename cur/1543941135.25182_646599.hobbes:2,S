Ahh, ok, I obviously only tested compiling it in.
No need to make that one-liner function be a GPL-only export, it's not 
like any of the other regular sigpending functions are we export are 
GPL-only either (dequeue_signal() is, but that is because we *really* 
don't want people using that, and it's really about internal signal 
handling behavior).
