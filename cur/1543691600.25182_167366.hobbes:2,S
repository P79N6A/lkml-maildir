Hmm. The kernel assumes today that keycodes have 8 bits:
In drivers/char/keyboard.c emulate_raw() tries to invent
the codes that the keyboard probably sent and resulted in a given
keycode. It starts out
	if (keycode > 255)
		return -1;
In drivers/input/keyboards/atkbd.c we have tables that convert
scancodes to keycodes. The declaration is
	static unsigned char atkbd_set2_keycode[512];
the unsigned char means that no keycodes larger than 255 can be returned.
It really seems a pity to have to add new ioctls, and to have to release
a new version of the kbd package, and to waste a lot of kernel space,
while essentially nobody needs the resulting functionality.
