I would be surprised if this is not a day one bug, it probably
even affects the IRIX version of XFS.  Our problem is the lack
of a test case to find it - my efforts have come to naught so
far.  I'm having to cross my fingers that Jesper can extract a
bit more information when he's next able to hit it.

That, and another story - Jesper hijacked that thread ;) - the
inital bug there was found and fixed, and the fix has now been
merged.  But (fyi, Kasper) much of that thread is discussing a
different bug to this one.
cheers.
