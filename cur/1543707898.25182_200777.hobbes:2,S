Only because updatedb/find/du populate it sporadically.  things like
cron jobs run over night and fill the slab which *never* shrinks[1].

The page-cache is restricted to small sizes making the fs rather slow
at times.  Ideally with 1.5GB of RAM I'd like to be able to get 800MB
or so into the page-cache... not 200MB.
Maybe gradual page-cache pressure could shirnk the slab?
