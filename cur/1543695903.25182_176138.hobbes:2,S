Hi,
I don't know if the patch is correct, but :

Including opening braces within #if often fools editors such as emacs
which count them and don't know about #if. Then, editing the rest of
the file can become annoying because it simply thinks that there are
two embedded for loops.
Other solutions to this problem often include one of these constructs
which are unfortunately not as beautiful :
1) a still readable one
#if CONFIG_MK7
	i=1;
#else
 	i=0;
#endif
 	for (; i<nr_mce_banks; i++) {
2) when there's absolutely no choice (eg changing part of an
   expression...) something unreadable like this.
	for (
#if CONFIG_MK7
	i=1;
#else
 	i=0;
#endif
 	i<nr_mce_banks; i++) {
I'm sure other people have other solution that don't come to mind.
Cheers,
Willy
