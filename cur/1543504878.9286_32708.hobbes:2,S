1.  What is a good way to diagnose/correct this?
2.  Why do you suppose that I can boot 2.2.5 and 2.2.10 just fine, but not
2.3.13?
Actually, I can't boot 2.3.10, 11, or 12 either.  I haven't tried any other
2.3s.
And just to make things interesting, I do have a 2.3.10 kernel that I built
that does work, but I can build another one that works.  Odd eh?  Maybe it's
a config thing, but I've tried a bunch of different ways.
Regards,
Brad
