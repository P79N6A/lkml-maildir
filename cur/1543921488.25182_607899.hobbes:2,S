Make that four: AVR32 and Blackfin use the generic GPIO API too.

There are many other architectures that can do things like that. But
since there are lots of variations in this kind of functionality from
architecture to architecture (and even chip to chip), it has been
excluded from the generic GPIO API.

How is it used? In many cases, you can get away with simply configuring
the port with the required features like debouncing, pullup, drain
options, etc. in the platform setup code where you can freely use
platform-specific port configuration calls.

These features are certainly being utilized in the platform setup code
on various platforms. I guess the current API might be too simple for
drivers that need to reconfigure the port on the fly, but I haven't
really seen any such drivers so far.
For example, the generic i2c-gpio driver supports three different ways
of driving the i2c lines depending on how the port was configured by
the platform.
