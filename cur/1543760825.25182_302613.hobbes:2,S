Subject: [patch 1/1] Fix kconfig docs typo: integer -> int
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/3/14/38

Trivial correction: the type of numbers for Kconfig is not integer but int (I
just verified because I followed the wrong docs and got a error, I looked
elsewhere and they are using int, and int works for me). Please apply.
