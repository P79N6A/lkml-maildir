Subject: Re: [RFC][PATCH] #define yield() for 2.4 scheduler (anticipating O(1))

I doubt this is an issue specific to the kernel or patches -- I've had
O(1) running with -aa and -rmap for quite some time with no problems.  I
was recoding rather than implementing the macro, but the concept was the
same.
