Hello Andrew,
                         Thanks for your help. The problem does not show 
up on every boot. I really dont know, what causes it to trigger. 
Nevertheless, I booted with the options you suggested. I kept executing 
dmesg often, and this time i was lucky to get those errors back again! 
So I am attaching the output of dmesg. Unfortunately, I can't see any 
message like ".....: returned with preemption imbalance".
Regards,
