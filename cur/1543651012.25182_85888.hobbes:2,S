This is just a random tangential thought here, but FWIW:
Why not just have a simple backup stripped-down "hardened" copy of Linux
lying around in a physical RAM region not used by the copy of Linux
actually running. Granted the running Linux doesn't do random physical
accesses when dying, the crash handler could then just boot that
secondary Linux which would then have a RAM disk containing the
appropriate scripts and binaries to handle the actual crash. Given the
cost of RAM these days, reserving a MB or two for this purpose should
probably not be that bad.
