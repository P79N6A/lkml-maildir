Interleaving interrupt delivery will completely break TCP header 
prediction, and cost you far more CPU time than it will save.  In fact, 
because of the locking, it will probably scale negatively with the 
number of CPUs, if your workload is mostly TCP/IP processing.  The way 
around this is to ensure that the packets for any given TCP socket are 
all delivered to the same processor.  If you have multiple NICs and use 
802.3ad bonding with layer3+4 hashing, header prediction will work fine, 
and you don't have to disable irqbalance, because it will do the right 
thing.
