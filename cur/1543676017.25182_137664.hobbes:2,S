In make a so-called "canned command sequence" is generated.
Quote from 'info make':
	On the other hand, prefix characters on the command line that refers
	to a canned sequence apply to every line in the sequence.  So the rule:
	     frob.out: frob.in
        	     @$(frobnicate)
	does not echo _any_ commands.
In kbuild this is exactly what happens.
So according to make info the command for the second sub-shell should not
be echoed.
