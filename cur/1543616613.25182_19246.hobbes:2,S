One corner case where emulation would IMHO make sense would be CMPXCHG8.
It would allow to do efficient inline mutexes in pthreads, and hit the
emulation only on 386/486. cpu feature flag checking is unfortunately
not an option normally for inline code.
-Andi (who would have already done it if he had an 486/386 to test)
