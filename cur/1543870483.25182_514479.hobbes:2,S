Hi.
I have a GPL driver (written by me) with workarounds, since I hadn't know-how, 
when I wrote it. Now I've got 2.4 proprietary driver from the vendor. Is use of 
the 2.4 driver know-how OK? (And could be such driver merged?)
These are lines from the proprietary driver:
	   IMPORTANT SAFETY & LEGAL INFORMATION:
         This source file is provided as part of the SensAble
         Technologies PDD/GHOST Software Development Toolkit in
         order to facilitate the use of PCI-based PHANToM haptic
         interface devices across various Linux kernel revisions.
         It is meant to be recompiled without modification.  It
         should NOT be modified in any way. Any modification of
         this source code will void any and all software and/or
         hardware warranties and maintenance agreements with

         modification of this source file may result in the damage
         or failure of the user's hardware.  SensAble Technologies

         or injury resulting from the modification of this file.
It's obvious, that if somebody was using the GPL driver, he'll lost warranty et 
al. (But this is not the question.)
thanks,
