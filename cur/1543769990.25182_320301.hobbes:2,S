People do run crypto on old slow machines, and also laptops configured 
to use as little power as possible. I wouldn't be surprised if latencies 
got in the >10ms range pretty regularly on some systems which are pretty 
mainstream.
Just my read on it, if a flag will prevent deadlock without relying on 
callers doing the right thing, that's probably a desirable change WRT 
future stability.
