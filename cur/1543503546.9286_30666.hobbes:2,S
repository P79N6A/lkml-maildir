  There aren't any :-). For open/release all work is done in VFS before
your function might be called and so there's no need of default function.
ioctl() also does generic work automatically and any function is needed only
for fs-specific functions. Same for poll().
readdir() and fsync() have to be implemented to allow the functionality -- in
your case you have to call function of underlying fs and pass the results.
