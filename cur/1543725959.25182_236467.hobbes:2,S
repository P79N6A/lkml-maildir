OK.

posix_fadvise() will return -ENOSYS under 2.4.
However...  If you write any amount of data to a file with O_DIRECT, that
will, as a side-effect, remove _all_ of that file's pagecache.  In 2.4 as
well as 2.6.  So you could scrub the pagecache by reading the first 4k then
writing it back with O_DIRECT.
However O_DIRECT is supported on very few filesystems in 2.4.  ext2 and
reiserfs have it.
XFS in 2.4 has O_DIRECT, I think, but I don't know if the invalidation
side-effect works on XFS.

It's not guaranteed that this will work - if the pages which you're trying
to evict were accessed multiple times then it may take more page
replacement to reliably shoot them down.  But writing a 2xmemory file and
then deleting it will be a reasonably effective way of evicting most of
the other pagecache.
