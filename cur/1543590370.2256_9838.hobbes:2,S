I've been seeing these for a while now (2.4.4 - <=2.4.2) also coincidental
with a change to XFree86 X 4.0.3 from "MetroX" in the time frame.  Am not sure
exactly when they started but was wondering if they were significant.  It
seems some app is trying to delete or modify something.  On console and in syslog:
mtrr: no MTRR for fd000000,800000 found
mtrr: MTRR 1 not used
mtrr: reg 1 not used
while /proc/mtrr currently contains:
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size= 512MB: write-back, count=1
reg01: base=0xfd000000 (4048MB), size=   8MB: write-combining, count=1
Could it be the X server trying to delete a segment when it it starts up or
shuts down?  Is it an error in the X server to try to delete a non-existant
segment?  Does the kernel 'care'?  I.e. -- why is it printing out messages --
are they debug messages that perhaps should be off by default?
Concurrent with these messages and perhaps unrelated is a new, unwelcome,
behavior of X dying on display of some Netscape-rendered websites (cf. it
doesn't die under konqueror).
thanks,
