No Rob, most people don't bother responding because they read the FAQ 
for the list and they realize that this is waste of bandwidth of a lot 
of people that are important to Linux. You're wasting their times and 
this is why this should stop NOW.
You're soo arrogant you don't want to see how much YOU'RE wrong ?
See, I'm a computer geek that started at 11, that learned everything 
from the practical viewpoint (first assembly then Basic then structured 
language) and even going through structured programming classes 7 years 
latter they still managed to get brainwashed to the point that just now 
I realize that goto's are really a good thing, and that it should be 
used as standard practice (college has been 10+ years ago). So open your 
mind to the fact that you were brainwashed, and the fact that they 
brainwash so many people that aren't smart enough to question them, that 
everything is taken at face value.
And Linux is not a hobbist thing anymore. From the point a lot of people 
trust their businesses to Linux like I do everyday (I'm MIS with about 
12 Penguins, with about 30 more Microshits to be converted to Penguins), 
then you should respect people here. Me and I'm sure a lot others read 
this list daily, and they don't want to spend their time on this thread. 
I apreciate very much the work of everybody here, considering that they 
could probably make a hell of a lot more money through other ways, but 
they decided to go the open source way, and the whole world's society is 
benefiting from their work, instead of mostly benefiting big, greedy 
companies like microshit.
By the way, you're not being paid my Microshit or other companies that 
have a lot to benefit from stalling Linux development to troll this 
list, aren't you ?
