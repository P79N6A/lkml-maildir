F00F is not design flaw. It' just minor error. Flaw of such type for
fylesystem will be something like wrong work with filename exactly 37
characters length. And such errors can be workarounded, yes.

It's NOT additinal flaw. Windows9X/NT has the SAME flaw itself: you can
not see long and short names at the same time in directory list (exception
is specially designed programs and you can make such programs for Linux as
well) but you can use both ! Why "Program Files" is "PROGRA~1" and not
"PROGRAMF" ? To reduce problems from such collisions.
