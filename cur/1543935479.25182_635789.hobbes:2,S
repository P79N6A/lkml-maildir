Hi Andi,
I grepped and tried to do what you suggested.
The first file that git grep reported was:
arch/arm/common/rtctime.c:static const struct file_operations rtc_fops = {
So I cooked up the following patch (probably mangled, just to give you
a rough idea of what I did):

Unforunately, after I wrote the patch I noticed that on a vanilla
kernel that file doesn't compile
so I cannot verify the work I did.
Am I'm working in the right direction or should I completely redo the patch?
Thanks.
