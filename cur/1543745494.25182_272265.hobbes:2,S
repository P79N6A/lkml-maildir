ia64, s390 and x86_64 seem to be the only ones with their own code
to insert_vm_struct for 32-bit setup_arg_pages.

Whose vm_end and whose vm_start?  Well, no need to answer...
Check the comment on find_vma in mm/mmap.c:
/* Look up the first VMA which satisfies  addr < vm_end,  NULL if none. */
but perhaps you thought it returns NULL if addr is not covered by a vma?
If so, maybe your original fs/exec.c fix also needs that check added:
it's usually the case that there cannot be a vma above the stack being
set up here, but I don't know enough of all the architectures to say
that's always so (and it looks like not the case for 32-bit on ia64).
