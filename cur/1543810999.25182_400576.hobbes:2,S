No, that won't be correct.

Think of multiple page size support, the way we do it on ia64 is
effective have different PAGE_SHIFT for normal page and hugetlb
page.  Normal page has page shift of 14 bits (of 16K page size).
Hugetlb page has page shift of 28 bits (of 256MB page size).
For any address, regardless whether it is normal/hugetlb page,
they all have full 3 level (or 4 level page table).  So for hugetlb
address, pgd/pud/pmd/pte index are off by (28-14) bits compare
to normal page.  We just transform the address so all the generic
code can be applied.  It's sort of selling you a wood looking
vinyl car stick shift.
