This makes no sense. We are not talking mere aggregation here, we are
talking developmental convergence. If I wrote some code that was in the
Linux kernel, how can I enforce the terms of my code (guaranteed write to
Tivoize) in the derivative work that it becomes mixed with?

I am baffled how this could possibly work. You understand that the GPLv2
specifically guarantees that any derivative work will be Tivoizable and the
people who chose the GPLv2 specifically want it that way?
If I chose the GPLv2 over the GPLv3 as a conscious choice, that means I want
people to be able to Tivoize any derivative work made from my work that is
distributed.
