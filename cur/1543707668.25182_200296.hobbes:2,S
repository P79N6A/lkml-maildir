Nick, I'm not sure what capability this patch adds .. perhaps some words
of explanation.
So we have SMT/HT situations where we'd prefer to balance across cores;
that is, if 0, 1, 2, and 3 share a core and 4, 5, 6, and 7 share a core,
you'd like two processes to arrange themselves so one is on [0123] and
another is on [4567].  This is what the SD_IDLE flag indicated before.
With this patch, we can "weight" the load imposed by certain cpus, right?
What advantage does this give us?  On a given machine, won't the "weight"
of any one set of SMT siblings and cores be uniform with respect to all
the cores and siblings anyway?
Rick
