Any chance for people who use cardbus laptops to beable to use their ps/2
mouse and the cardbus at the same time?  I'm not the only one who has the
problem.  As long as pcmcia/cardbus is in the kernel psaux is completely
useless and locks up the keyboard.  Plus oops's when ejecting the cards (I'm
talking logically and phyiscally) which noone wants to work with so I quit
sending them.
