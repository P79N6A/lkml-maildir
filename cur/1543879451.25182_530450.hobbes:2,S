I think this is racy.
Say, if the task which does xxx_start(p) [let's call it task q] is not freezeable, and task p is
already frozen when q  calls xxx_start, then we might be in a situation
where 
- Freezer has declared the whole system to be frozen. Hence the thread
  issuing the 'freeze'(suspend/hotplug) can go ahead and do whatever it wants to.
- Task 'p' which was supposed to be frozen , is now running and
  *surprise* We have a thread running on a cpu which ain't there any more!
I feel we need some kind of a global rwlock. 
DEFINE_RWLOCK(freezer_status_lock);
int  xxx_start(struct task_struct *p)
{
	int ret = 0;
	ret = read_trylock(&freezer_status_lock);
	if(ret) 
	 /* We've succeeded. So lets thaw the chap */
	 thaw_process(p);
	/* If we've failed to acquire trylock, that means freezer doesn't 
	 * depend on us.
	 * So lets simply wait without thawing p
	 */
	
	return ret;
}
void xxx_end(int state)
{
	if(state)
		read_unlock(&freezer_status_lock);
}
int try_to_freeze_tasks()
{
	do {
		/* The regular freezer code */
		if (!todo && !write_trylock(&freezer_status_lock));
			continue;
		/* When the freezer goes back, it will find task 'p'
		 * woken up and hence wait for it to get frozen
		 */
	}while(todo);
}
void try_to_thaw_tasks()
{
	.
	.
	.
	write_unlock(&freezer_status_lock);
}
	int state = xxx_start(p);
	... wait for something which depends on p...
 	xxx_end(state);
However, now that I look at it again, I see that it will fail in our case
where we might need to nest the try_to_freeze_tasks call.
Hmm, we don't have a rwlock variant that allows multiple writers, now do
we?!
