The Athlon has an extended version of 3DNOW, which the kernel uses as of
test11-pre2. The entire 3DNOW option has nothing to do with userspace;
unlike the Screaming Sindy Extensions, 3DNOW requires no (extra) kernel 
support.
The 3DNOW option is about the kernel using extended instructions for
internal functions such as zero_page() and copy_page().
This is no advantage on K6 processors, but on Athlon processors (well, most
of them anyway) it is a gain of more than a factor 2 for these functions.
The test11pre2 code will also not run on a K6-II/III, but this valid due to the 
fact that this new code is > 2x faster than the old code, and the old code
was no win on the K6-II/III anyway.

Won't work. (see previous comment).

Some of the "MMX" instructions are part of "3Dnow" according  to AMD
publications. This is especially true for the "prefetch" instructions which
have a different memnonic/opcode on Intel CPU's.

The 512 is a rough estimate of the minimum size of the copy that makes it
worth saving and restoring the extra processor-state for using mmx.

The way it is done now, even a generic i386 compiled kernel (think
distributions) will use the fast MMX raid code. For the copy_page and
friends this extra test is probably too much overhead. (the < 512 test is
inlined and often constant...)
