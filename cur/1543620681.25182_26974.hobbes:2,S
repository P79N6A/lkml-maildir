The wrapper fills the buffer using copy_from_user() -- even for _IOR
ioctls because some are labeled wrong -- and the driver needs that data.
I can't zero the buffer ...

Good point.  Yes, that should work.

No.  It does the same.

I don't see a overflow can easily happen here.  There is one kernel
strack _per process_.  Calling schedule() will also switch the stack.

struct v4l2_buffer should fit onto the stack too.
