The openSSI process model is quite different than Bproc or Mosix or
your "guest system" proposal.  In the openSSI model, there is no
pseudo or shadow process at the processes creation node;  after
a processes migrates, all its system calls are executed on the new
node and signalling to the process is done directly to the process on
the new node.  Besides the obvious performance advantages this can
give, it can also provide availability advantages because the 
creation node can go down without taking the process down with it.
