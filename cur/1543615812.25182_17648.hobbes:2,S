Unfortunately it looks like it is going to take a bit more than fixing
trivial rejects.  I started working on it today.  I suspect I am going
to need a lot better understanding of Ingo's scheduler, so I am learning
it.  I am traveling tomorrow but should be able to dive into it on
Monday.
Ingo and I both agree that the patches together are a Good Thing.
I have a fully ported patch at this point but it hard locks on boot.  I
believe the problem to be a few bits in sched.c, but there may be some
underlying changes that break assumptions elsewhere.
We are working on it.  Help is always appreciated, though ;)
