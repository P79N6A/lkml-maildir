Thank you very much for the effort!

The debug patch didn't do anything. This means it is not an unset bitmap 
problem at all otherwise it should have self corrected itself.

Urgh. Dereferencing there? That can only be next that's deferencing meaning 
the run_list entry is bogus. That should only ever be done under runqueue 
lock so I have a race somewhere where it's not. Time for more looking.
