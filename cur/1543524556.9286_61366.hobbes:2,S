Greetings,
I am modifying the read/write calls in the ext2 fs,
and I would like to know where the read/write system
calls are handled so that I could implement a
compressed fs that will run a compression algorithm
while the file is being read/written, but before the
program notices anything different?  While looking at
the kernel source, I noticed that there were several
different read and write calls in the kernel, and I am
not sure which does which (fs/read_write.c &
fs/ext2/read.c for example).  I'm not even sure if I
should be looking in the fs directory.
Ciao
