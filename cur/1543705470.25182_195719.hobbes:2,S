the follow_page() issue could be handled like the 4/4 patch does it: a
repeat-until loop of manual-fault + lookup-pte (we break out of the loop
if the manual fault fails or when the lookup is successful). The race
window is so small that the repeating solution is i think far superior
to artificially dirtying the pte.
