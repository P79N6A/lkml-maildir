Subject: 2.6.1: atkbd.c errors + mouse errors with a belkin KVM

I'm seeing some strange behavior using kernel 2.6.1 and a Belkin KVM. I 
have talked to two others who have seen the same problem. This did not 
happen in 2.6.0 or any 2.4 kernel.
When switching ports using the keyboard, that is hitting scroll lock 
twice and then the port # I want ( 1 - 16), then coming back the same 
way, I often get the following error:
kernel: atkbd.c: Unknown key released (translated set 2, code 0x7a on 
isa0060/serio0).
I have also seen this same error while switching from X11 to console, 
but only once. In that one case, I lost mouse control, and keyboard 
control, and was unable to regain either. I had to reboot to rectify the 
situation.
I'm not sure if this happens when pushing the buttons on the front of 
the kvm.

Belkin Omniview Matrix2 , Model F1DM216T

Is there any further information I can submit to help solve this?
