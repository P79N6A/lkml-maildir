I finally had a chance to try this today.  I applied a slightly
different patch (2.6.11-rc2-iso3.diff) on top of patch-2.6.11-rc2.  I
tried to use 2.6.11-rc2-mm2, but could not due to conflicts with other
scheduler updates.
It is not clear whether the realtime threads are running in the new
scheduler class.  Checking with schedtool yields odd results.
(Before, my old schedtool always said "POLICY I: SCHED_ISO".)

The results of the first run indicate something is badly wrong.  It is
quite possible that I got confused and messed up the build somehow.

Loading the realtime-lsm and then running with SCHED_FIFO *does* work
as expected on this kernel.  I should retry the test with *exactly*
the expected patch sequence.  What would that be?
