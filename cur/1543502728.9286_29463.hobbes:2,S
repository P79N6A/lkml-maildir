Maybe we could switch to the standard library versioning system, i.e.:
major.minor.patchlevel
Where patchlevel changes indicate bugfixes only, minor version changes
indicate new features but no change to existing APIs, and major version
changes happen when you deliberately break existing APIs for cruft
clearing.
Drivers (and driver writers) would then know that code written for Linux
e.g. 9.7.43 would work for any future Linux 9.foo.bar kernel, but not for
Linux 10.wibble.fish. It might have a minimum required minor version if it
relies on a new API introduced.
At the moment it seems there's no technical reason whether a new release
gets a minor version or a full major version bump; it's more a PR thing --
2.0 was a lot different from 1.2, but then 2.4 will be a lot different from
2.2 (esp. for SMP people), but I doubt it will become Linux 3.0, somehow.
