so why didn't you take this to the netfilter development mailinglist
first?  I don't think this is of general interest to linux-kernel, which
certainly has more than enough postings per day, and the subject is
clearly netfilter-only.

this means that you have the generic iptables core. this enables you for
example to use some out-of-kernel compiled iptables_foo module. 
compare this with enabling scsi support, but not enabling a single scsi
host.

yes, this makes sense.  packet filtering is the 'filter' table.  It is
perfectly legal to use NAT ('nat' table) or mangling ('mangle') without
enabling packet filtering.

see above.

it is true.

connection tracking provides a service to the kernel.  If you load it,
any code within the kernel can derive the connection tracking entry to
which a packet belongs.  Even though there is no current code in the
kernel (besides iptable_nat and ipt_state) that uses this information,
we should not decide on that.  
A possible application would be something like a 'cfq' (derived from the
stochastic fairness queue).  This would eliminate the 'stochastic' part
which tries to determine which 'flow' (basically one direction of a
connection) a packet belongs to.

no, at least not from the point of view of the netfilter coreteam.

Everything marked as 'NEW' means that your .config file did not contain
a setting (i.e. it was copied from a kernel that didn't have support for
those options).  This is also used for 'make oldconfig'.
