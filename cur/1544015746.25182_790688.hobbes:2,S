It is perfectly soluble right now, use the existing /proc interface. If
you want to specifically victimise new tasks first then set everything
else with an adjust *against* being killed and new stuff will start off
as cannon fodder until classified.
The name approach is the wrong way to handle this. It has no reflection
of heirarchy of process, targetting by users, containers etc.. 
In fact containers are probably the right way to do it
