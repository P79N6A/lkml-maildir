Please add 'Quota support causes OOPS'  Someone posted a patch but I don't
have the reference offhand.  That patch appears to have fixed one person's
problems.

Actually this bug applies to all kernels as far back as early 2.3 afair.

I believe this would be the referenced patch.
Please add 'APM resume returns the machine to the first tty, crashes X'  This
appeared w/ test8.  If this is intended, I'd be very happy to know if so and
I can write in to xfree86 about it.  If not intended..fix needed.

With test8, pcmcia either with kernel code, mixed, or dhinds code; nothing is
usable.

This one can tentatively be moved into 'fixed'  I was one of the people
submitting this a long time ago and since that point in time numerous updates
have occured and I'm now able to transfer multi-gigs of data day after day
and no problems.

Fixed.  Only thing now is cosmetic.  It spews between a few and a few hundred
lines to klog on disconnect.

I use ppp frequently w/ current kernels, works fine.

Hmm, upgrade cdrecord perhaps?  I'm using the second to last release and I'm
not burning coasters.  cdrecord is undergoing a scsi subsystem rewrite.

Related to pcmcia, no, not fixed.  Certain mixes of drivers and hardware can
stick the interrupt until they're removed and a different card inserted.

OOPS fixed, spewage not fixed.
