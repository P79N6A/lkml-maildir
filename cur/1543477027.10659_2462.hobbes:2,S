   Here Mr. Allbery, or Mr. Xymoron, has misquoted me -- removed all my
   text leaving only Mr. Allbery's text..

   Majordomo does very lightweight work, even though the 'resend' could
   in certain configurations do miracles with suitable C programs -- and
   'unsubscribe *' could use some such too..  Most of the actual routing
   work *including list expansion* is in email routing, and that task is
   done in the system MTA.

   Yes, that is most definitely important part.  VGER runs all the time
   at system activity around 20-50%.   Measuring what the kernel really
   does deep down inside has not been done.  This is typical TOP report:
 8:27pm  up 1 day,  9:32,  3 users,  load average: 2.76, 3.07, 3.13
123 processes: 120 sleeping, 3 running, 0 zombie, 0 stopped
CPU states: 82.2% user, 15.6% system, 91.1% nice,  2.6% idle
Mem:  125248K av, 120500K used,   4748K free,  55860K shrd,  33468K buff
Swap: 101112K av,      0K used, 101112K free                 32948K cached
   Wow, unusually low amount of system activity.
