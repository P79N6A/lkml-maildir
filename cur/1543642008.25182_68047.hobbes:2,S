If you have a good raid card then you can do online resizing, volume
allocation, volume format changing, volume migration etc. For those
cases you have to get the journalling right in order to be able to do
that kind of thing properly

Standard PC with 80Gb disks benefits from dynamic partitioning. But if
you are pushed then you can shove 3ware 8500 PCI cards into your slots
and get 12 SATA hotplug IDE channels per PCI slot.
Thats 12 * 200Gb hotswap per pci slot. Which given 4 slots of it would
come out at a nice 9600Gb of disk. Maybe you can archive usenet on one
PC after all 8)
