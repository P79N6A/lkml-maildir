So you are saying that if I merge my ptyx module into the kernel tree THEN 
these
exports would be added?  They would have to be, since I would still want 
my 
driver to be a module instead of statically linked with the kernel like 
pty is.
I think the fact that you had to "ask at the time what other PTY drivers 
there 
were" indicates that these symbols should have been simply exported to 
avoid 
any problems with out of tree PTY drivers.
By not exporting these symbols it means that the Linux kernel is now 
forcing 
anyone who wants to develop a PTY type TTY driver to be merged into the 
kernel 
tree by not exporting these TTY functions. This doesn't seem very "open 
and 
flexible".
