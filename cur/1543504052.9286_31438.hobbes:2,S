No chance. For various reasons, it's not possible for me to modify the
hardware.

60 usec. That's cutting it fine though. Somewhere between 20-40 would
be perfect.

On most occasions, yes.

Not at all .. I've been expecting it ;)

Perhaps I haven't quite understood kernel programming as well as I should,
but I was under the impression I can't use libc functions in the kernel?

I've considered it, but it's really not worth the effort. If I can't get
it to work on a stock kernel, I'm not going to bother.
Thanks for the help,
Rob.
