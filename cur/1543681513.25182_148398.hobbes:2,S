   This still doesn't solve the issue with the input api. The input layer 
can be modular on many levels. Even if we force the input core to be built in 
this will not stop people from building the keyabord drivers as modules. 
Having PS/2 support always turned to Y will not also work since there are 
systems that use just USB. Their is a point where users will just have to 
read the README and follow directions. We can't make people do the right 
thing.
   Also doing this kind of thing only covers up broken framebuffer 
drivers. Unfortunetly its going to take me months to cleanup and make the 
fbdev drivers behave right.
