I'll try it.

Suse uses bootsplash. Even without bootsplash the console jumps to a new vc
then back at every boot, on systems with bootsplash and/or slow systems this
causes the screen to flicker.

That is infact my intention. I've looked some at the swsusp2 code but it
looks ugly. My plan is to create a general kernel level interface to
bootsplash, then add hooks in swsusp. This code should probably live in the
bootsplash patch.
