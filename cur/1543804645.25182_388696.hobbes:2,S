Yes, absolutely.  Once exit_mmap (a latency regression which was
introduced in 2.6.14) and rt_run_flush/rt_garbage_collect (which have
always been problematic) are fixed, 500usecs will stick out like a sore
thumb even on a regular PREEMPT kernel.
Also, you should be able to capture this latency in /proc/latency trace
by configuring an -rt kernel with PREEMPT_DESKTOP and hard/softirq
preemption disabled.
