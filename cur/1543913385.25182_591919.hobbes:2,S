Does it really matter as they routinely do not take zone->lru_lock
either? pages_min, pages_low and pages_high are currently examined on a
regular basis by zone_watermark_ok() without any locks held in the page
allocator and page reclaim path. Glancing through this, it would appear
that the code in question has the same level of locking protection with
zone->lru_lock or zone->lock.
Is memory hotadd specifically taking the lru_lock somewhere? I can only
think of the seqlock at the moment.
