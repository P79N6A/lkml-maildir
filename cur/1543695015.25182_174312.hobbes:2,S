You're still registering with the normal serial major/minor without
using serial core.  That means the normal serial driver can't be used
when sn_serial is loaded, e.g. for using a pci serial card in an
altix.  The irq mess still isn't fixed - this isn't exactly an issue
with this driver but I exposing the bloody mess outside arch/ia64/sn
is a very bad idea.  I'd suggest kicking ajm to fix that up.
pciio.h has no business beeing included in this driver that doesn't
use anything PCIish, again a core SN issue that needs fixing.
Also after reading through the new comment ontop of the file it might
be a good idea to rename it to sn_console.c, especially now that there
is a real ioc4 serial driver.
