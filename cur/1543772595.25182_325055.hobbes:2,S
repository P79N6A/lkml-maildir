Sure, this should only occur on physical CPU hotplug. I haven't hardware
which supports physical CPU hotplug. What I'm testing is supend-to-ram.
In this case, we offline all APs and BIOS possibly will put APs into
some special states (maybe reboot APs). It's very like physical CPU
hotplug.

No, I haven't. IA64 doesn't support suspend/resume, so my test case
can't apply to IA64.
Thanks,
