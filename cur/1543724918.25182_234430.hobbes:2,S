Suppose you want to do something with the file's contents before you 
delete it, but the system goes down before you have the chance.  Wasn't 
that the impetus for this thread?  With XFS, the potential for data loss 
is greater; that was my point.  I believe that everyone who pays extra 
for batter-backed I/O caches would agree. :)  Sure, different 
filesystems have their options, but this liability is ingrained in XFS.
