Yes. I was a bit more explicit in the timer patch:
"The i386 timers use a struct timer_opts that has a field init
pointing at a __init function. The rest of the struct is not __init.
Nothing is wrong, but if we want to avoid having references to init stuff
in non-init sections, some reshuffling is needed."
So yesterday's series of __init patches is not because there were
bugs, but because it is desirable to have the situation where
static inspection of the object code shows absence of references
to .init stuff. Much better than having to reason that there is
a reference but that it will not be used.
Where the memory win is important the code should be rewritten a bit.
