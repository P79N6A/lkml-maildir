Subject: [2.6.25-rc3] ACPI _PPC limiting processor speed...

My 2.2GHz [1] Thinkpad T61 is unable to get past 1.2GHz, seemingly
because of the _PPC ACPI objects [2].
Given that the _PPC object is different for both cores, is this more
of a BIOS bug or an ACPI interpreter problem? The problem was present
in 2.6.24-rc, 2.6.24 final and since.
BIOS is 7LETA9WW/2.09, so current - would any further information be
useful for debugging this problem, and would dumping the ACPI tables
be useful?
Thanks,
  Daniel
