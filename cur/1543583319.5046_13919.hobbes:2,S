here is an extract from dmesg from 2.4.2 and -ac6,
showing a disparity in cpu clock speed..
-ac6 has inserted a line claiming my clock is 400Mhz
(it is actually 533 -- and i believe my fsb is 133).
i don't think i compiled these two radically
differently.  what could i have done wrong to cause
this?  or has -ac6 introduced a bug of some sort?
any suggestions for debugging or additional
information?
thanks,
bradley mclain
