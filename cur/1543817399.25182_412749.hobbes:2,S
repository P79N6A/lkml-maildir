It's been done before, at least for some hooks (ie one implementation by
antivirus folks).  But to actually do this with full support for all
hooks would require some changes.  For example, the security_task_kill()
hook is called under several potential locks.  At least
read_lock(tasklist_lock) and plain rcu_read_lock() (and I thought also
write_lock(tasklist_lock), but can't find that instance right now).
Clearly that can be fixed, but atm a user-mode lsm isn't entirely
possible.
