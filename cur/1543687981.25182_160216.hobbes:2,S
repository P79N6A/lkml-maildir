Huh?   And what, pray tell, makes cdrom special?  Not to mention
the use of ioctl, the inherent raciness of the interface and the fact
that yes,

And what about other namespaces?

Or the possibility that
	* mnt might've been freed by that point.
	* we might have the damn thing mounted in several places, some
busy, some not.
	* cdrom had been used not by mount.
	* cdrom had been mounted just as we had decided to tell that it's
not busy.
