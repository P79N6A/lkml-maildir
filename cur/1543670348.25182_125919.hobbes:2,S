I'm trying to  have usb working on my  pc, based on a dual  athlon and a
motherboard GA-7DPXDW with linux 2.4.20 with  the patch for xfs from sgi
and the patch for the sensors.
I was reading the linux-usb faq and I found:

So I'm  writing hoping  to be  helpful. Usb  works, but  I have  to pass
noapic to  the kernel.  Otherwise I get  "device not  accepting address"
when I plug a device in the usb port. The motherboard has been bought in
september. I remember the older mobos  had the southbridge b1, which had
a faulty usb. My mobo has got the southbridge b2, which works.
Is there anything useful I can do?
Can you please explain me what "noapic" does? I think it changes the way
interrupts are  handled, but I'm  not sure. Do  I miss something  when I
pass noapic to the kernel?
Bye
PS: can you please cc your answer to my mailbox? Thank you.
