At one time someone had a script to grep objdump -S vmlinux for the
stack allocations generated by gcc and check them. It found a few 
cases. It is easy to rewrite, as they are very regular instruction 
patterns at the beginning of functions (at least when you ignore variable 
length stack arrays, which do not seem to be common in the kernel anyways)

You normally get a silent hang or worse a stack fault exception 
(which linux/x86 without kdb cannot recover from) which gives you instant 
reboot.
The ikd patches contain a stack overflow checker for runtime.
