actually, no, my motivation for it was KVM (a Linux based hypervisor and 
its paravirtual interface). You said that VMI wont hinder Linux 
development and design in any way and can adopt to whatever change the 
upstream kernel does, so i'm taking your word for that.

that's not really the right argument. This obviously affects the host 
kernel too if it has CONFIG_PARAVIRT enabled. The other option is the 
removal (or temporary disabling) of the whole CONFIG_VMI and 
CONFIG_PARAVIRT stuff if you cannot get into minimal release shape, it's 
experimental stuff after all.

no. What you need is to keep existing mechanisms and not hack off the 
vdso and CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO...

there's no need to disable the VDSO for old userspace ...
