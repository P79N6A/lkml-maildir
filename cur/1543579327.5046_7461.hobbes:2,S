We use the same same cpu-affinity mechanism as the current scheduler.
This simply gives a 'priority boost' to tasks that last ran on the
current CPU.  In our multi-queue scheduler, tasks on a remote queue
must have high enough priority (to overcome this boost) before being
moved to the local queue.
