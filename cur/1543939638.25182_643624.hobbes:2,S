In Cambridge, when we discussed cleanups that touch a lot of files
but have no functional change -- somebody suggested that right
after rc1 closes is a good time.  The reasoning was that they
would not conflict with the functional changes in rc1.
However, I recall Linus saying something about "Andrew is special"
WRT permission to push cleanups after the rc1 window; so I don't
know what the final ruling was -- if there was such a ruling.
