Serialization of the users does not help for protecting the timer queues
especially not on SMP.
Can you please give a real example how to simplify this. Nobody has any
objections to simplify locking when possible. But unproven claims in
repeated form do not help. After a while they just get annoying.

I do not really understand what you want to achieve. 
Timer bases are related to clock sources. You can switch the clock
source of the CLOCK_MONOTONIC timer base at any given time to a
different one which is not NTP adjusted. Where is the problem?
The timer base does not care about the underlying clock source at all.
All it knows of it is the function which reads the current time related
to this clock. When the underlying clock changes the way it generates
current time then the timer base does not care at all. 
This is not a problem of hrtimers. Its a problem of the clock source
abstraction layer like John Stultz GTOD framework.
If you want to have timer bases with dynamic clock sources which can go
away then you have to take care of much more than locking. But I really
do not see a need for this.
