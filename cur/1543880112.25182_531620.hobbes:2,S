I can give you a patch (or set of patches) against the latest git 
vanilla kernel version if that would help.  There have been changes to 
the vanilla scheduler code since 2.6.20 so the latest patch on 
sourceforge won't apply cleanly.  I've found that implementing this as a 
series of patches rather than one big patch makes it easier fro me to 
cope with changes to the underlying code.
