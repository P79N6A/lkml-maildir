Hello,

Just to make things clear. I didn't say I could reproduce it on 2.6.21-rc4.
In fact I'm running 2.6.21-rc4-mm1 with no problems so far. I just replied
to show my sysrq dumps of processes states with 2.6.21-rc2-mm1.
I could reproduce similar (but still each time slightly different) hangs 
on -mm series from 2.6.20-mm1 to 2.6.21-rc2-mm1. 2.6.21-rc3-mm1 worked well
for me so not sure If my report is still valid here.
Sorry if I didn't make it clear enough.

As I previously noticed each time the system hang I/O activity to disk looked
dead (couldn't even sysrq-s).

True. I'm using ext3.

No. He is not.
