The temporary "hangs" are so bad any way to mitigate this horrible
problem will be useful. The machine is stuck so long in this stuff
literal network timeouts occur. It's insanely bad, this is really
beyond the scope of a performance problem and into the realm of an
out-and-out bug. A machine stuck for that long in this code is
effectively dead. I'm just slightly more patient than average users.
Cheers,
Bill
