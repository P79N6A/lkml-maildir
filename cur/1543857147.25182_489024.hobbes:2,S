Ok.

And this is the button that rfkill was originally designed for.
Laptops with integrated WiFi cards from Ralink have a hardware button that don't send anything to
userspace (unless the ACPI event is read) and does not directly control the radio itself.

And this event should be reported by a generic approach right? So it should
be similar as with your point 2 below. But this would mean that the driver
should create the input device. Or can a driver send the KEY_WIFI event
over a main layer without the need of a personal input device?
I am not that familiar with the input device layer in the kernel, and this is
my first attempt on creating something for it, so I might have missed something. ;)
Because it could still register with rfkill, only not give the callback functions
for changing the radio or polling. Then the driver can use the send_event function
to inform rfkill of the event and process it further. The sysfs attributes could
even be reduced to only add the change_status attribute when the radio_enable
and radio_disable callback functions are implemented.

This is indeed the main goal of rfkill. :)

This is clear too. Rfkill is only intended for drivers that control a device with
a transmitter (WiFi, Bluetooth, IRDA) that have a button that is intended to
do something with the radio/transmitter.

Yes, this was what I intended to do with rfkill, so at that point we have
the same goal.

I indeed meant a sysfs attribute. I should have been more clear on this. :)
