What stops you from providing non-sleeping messaging scheme
primitives in Adeos? 
Adeos -> Client: Use virtual interrupt vectors and use your ipipe
   for it.
Client -> Adeos: Provide Emission of this virtual interrupts in
Adeos.
Also some kind of shared memory and a "commit" for this memory is
needed in Adeos. Allocation of this memory should be up to the
requester of this memory, so Adeos doesn't need to wait for it
and neither does the RTOS on the other end.
With that primitives (plus some atomic magic ;-)) you can build
non-sleeping messaging.
Karim, is sth. like this planned or is it senseless?
