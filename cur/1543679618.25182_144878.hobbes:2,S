Broken ehci-hcd things seem to be fixed with this patch. I had
numerous crashes, hangs, filesystem corruption, etc. with
 2.4.19,20,21 until I applied this. I am using,
 DVD burner in an external USB 2.0  enclosure (same as the one rebranded by Belkin)
 IDE drive in the same model enclosure.
 Epson 3200 scanner.
 Using them before the patch, particularly simultaneously, caused driver crashes. They
 seem to share the bus nicely now.
 Please CC me with replies.
