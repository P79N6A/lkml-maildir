Efficiency of opening, clearly. Efficiency of creating device nodes,
also. That's probably not a significant problem, but it may be if you
have large numbers of devices. Remember that waking up a user space
daemon which in turn frobs the FS is not a lightweight activity. Like
I said, probably not a big deal, but something to bear in mind.

Once devfsd has persistence support, this will go away. Note that
already devfsd can be used to control uid/gid/perms. And it can do it
in a way that is far more space efficient than a regular FS, because a
whole group of devices can be modified with a single config entry.

To avoid the major table indexing/searching, there is no alternative
but a virtual /dev. It can't be done with user space managing /dev.

Not bloat. A few pages or so. Cheaper than user space-based solutions,
is my guess.

And miss the benefits of a virtual /dev.

I agree that the current use of tar isn't that nice. It's not terribly
ugly either. And it's easy to solve in devfsd in a nice way.

You're talking about devfsd. Already exists. There's a lot you can do
with it already.

Devfsd. Check it out.
