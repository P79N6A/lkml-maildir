I shortly considered redoing the boot process, but then it looked 
too risky to me. 
e.g. I guess on x86-64 it wouldn't be that difficult, just a bit of work,
but on i386 with all the weird hardware it could be quite destabilizing.
But doing it on x86-64 only is not a good solution.

I don't see a better short term solution.
If you had done it properly in 2.5 it would be working and tested
by now ;-) , but doing it in the middle of 2.6 would seem a bit misplaced
to me.
