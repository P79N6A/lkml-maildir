Al,
Forgive me if I guess wrongly, but patch-2.4.5.log says of -pre3:
 - Al Viro: sanity-check user arguments, zero-terminated strings etc.
from which I assume you made the proc_scsi_gen_write() mod below.
I'm not sure what it ought to say instead, but I believe the "else"
case is wrong: buffer[length] is in that case buffer[PAGE_SIZE],
just beyond the end of the page we have allocated.
Hugh
