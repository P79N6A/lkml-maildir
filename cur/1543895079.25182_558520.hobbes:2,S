See, that's the problem I have with your arguments.  "Same freedom for
everyone" is a political slogan.  It is not a reasoned thought.  "We
must stop terrorists" is also a political slogan, and the consequence
"Tivo should install ROMs so they don't have more rights than users" is
about equivalent as a victory for freedom as disallowing liquids in hand
luggage is a victory against terrorism.  Both are nonsensical
consequences of a political agenda that is applied without thought.
