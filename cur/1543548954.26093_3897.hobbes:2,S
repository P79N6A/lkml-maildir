Is this connected with the L-K thread a while back about some jumper
on newer ZipDrives needing to be changed for them to work properly? My
ZipDrive is old enough not to be affected by that problem, so I didn't
take too much notice of the thread, but I vaguely remember it.
I can't help re your floppy query though...sorry...
Best wishes from Riley.
