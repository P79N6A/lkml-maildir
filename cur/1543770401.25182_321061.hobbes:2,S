Well yes, but *somewhere* along the line they'll need to interact
with something else in a timely (in the RT sense) manner?

I'd have to think about that one ;)
But yeah I agree they seem to broadly move in the same direction,
but let's not split hairs.

OK. I what sort of applications can't tolerate the nanokernel type
separation? I guess the hosts would be seperated by some network like
device, shared memory, etc. devices that use functionality provided
by the nanokernel?

Well yeah, from what I gather, the PREEMPT_RT work needn't be excluded
on the basis that it can't provide hard-RT - for a real world example
all the sound guys seem to love it ;) so it obviously is worth something.
And if the complexity can be nicely hidden away and configured out,
then I personally don't have any problem with it whatsoever :) But
I don't like to comment further on actual code until I see the actual
proposed patch when you're happy with it.
