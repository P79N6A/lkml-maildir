We do have a mailing list where the networking developers
actually hang out, netdev@vger.kernel.org
It seems you're not configuring the multicast route correctly
or something like that, the socket stuff should all work just
fine because David Stevens at IBM is testing this stuff all
the time.
Why don't you move your multicast route setup questions over
to the netdev list?
Thanks.
