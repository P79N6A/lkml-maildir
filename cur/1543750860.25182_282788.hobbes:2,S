Hmmm... I'm not sure how necessary it is, and I think it slows down
resume a tiny bit. However, the more I think about it the more correct it
seems, so here's the follow-up patch. (Andrew, even if this patch is
rejected, please commit my first one to the next -mm release. That patch
alone is still an improvement over the current code.)
