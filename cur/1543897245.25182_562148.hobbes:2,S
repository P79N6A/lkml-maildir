I'm sure you probably wouldn't have a problem with using just
schedule_work. But that's shared and you don't know with what. A
function in the keventd work queue can call schedule (not recommended,
but with closed source drivers, you'd never know. schedule_work is
EXPORT_SYMBOL not EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL).
So, if you convert it to work queues, I'd strongly recommend adding a
new instance.
