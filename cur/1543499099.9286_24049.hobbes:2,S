Subject: superblock lock SMP safe ?

extern inline void lock_super(struct super_block * sb)
{
        if (sb->s_lock)
                __wait_on_super(sb);
        sb->s_lock = 1;
}
isn't there a race here ? shouldn't it be more like lock_buffer ?
while (!test_and_set_bit(0, &sb->s_lock)) 
	__wait_on_super(sb);
or is it that all paths using lock_super already have the kernel lock ?
