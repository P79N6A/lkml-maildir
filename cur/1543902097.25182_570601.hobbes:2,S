I can't speak for Fedora, but RHEL disables XFS in their kernel likely
because it is known to cause problems with 4K stacks.

Again don't assume that because Fedora and RHEL have 4K stacks means
that MD/LVM/XFS is widely tested.
Additionally I think I should point out that the problems pointed out so
far are not the only problem areas with 4K stacks.  There are out of
tree drivers to consider as well, and use cases like ndiswrapper.
