I'm unlikely to dig up that patch making ohci-hcd use a hcd_cb,
which would mean that the submit path (a) gets rid of one fault
mode, (b) slightly speeds up the submit path, and (c) all but
stops using the heap.  Even though they'd be fine updates ...
I'd be glad to see someone else contribute such cleanups though!
The uhci-hcd version would be trickier, and on 64bit CPUs it
would not fit in the 64 bytes Max suggested -- without some
work to shrink that driver.
