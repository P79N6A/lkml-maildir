Can we drop this straw-man discussion now?
We don't do binary hooks in the kernel. Full stop. It's a gray area
legally (and whatever you say won't change that), but it's absolutely not
gray from a distribution standpoint.
AND IT WASN'T EVER THE REASON FOR REMOVING THE DRIVER IN THE FIRST PLACE!
So stop whining about it. The driver got removed because the author asked 
for it.
