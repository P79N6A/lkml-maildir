Subject: [2.6.11.10][Ali15x3] Crash at startup after disks detection in DMA66 mode

Hello. I used the kernel 2.6.10-gentoo-rc9 with my notebook (Pentium 4-M, no
trademark), it worked fine and I updated to 2.6.11.10 with fbsplash patch, and
now DMA causes the system to crash at boot time. I can't dump any message,
because my screen get flooded with the folowing one:
Free on bad allocation ressource <0000042>-<0000042>
It justs occurs after detection of the hard drive, and only if I activate
idebus=66 or ata0=66 parameters on command line. I have enabled Ali15x3 support
on the kernel and DMA support. The problem disappears if I disable the 66 mode,
but It worked before on the 2.6.10 kernel, so I don't think it is the same
problem as the one related to the last patch I saw for this driver:

    [PATCH] ide-disk: Fix LBA8 DMA
    This is from Gentoo's 2.6.11 patchset. A problem was introduced in 2.6.10
    where some users could not enable DMA on their disks (particularly ALi15x3
    users). This was a small mistake with the no_lba48_dma flag.

Thank you for answering.
