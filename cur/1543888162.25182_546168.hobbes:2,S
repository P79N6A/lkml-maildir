Wouldn't it be possible to use SoC timer functionality, too, and not limit
this to what is only present on the CPU die?
I guess the real question is, how high resolution does a high resolution
timer need to be, and how often do you want to be handling interrupts?
The 52XX has 8 general purpose timers and 2 slice timers. Both will
generate an interrupt once the clock hits a preset value, the timing
of which is determined by prescalers and the IPB clock..
