Ted,
..

4. Boot Time Failures
..
Boot hangs on a range of Dell docking stations (Latitude) 
        Almost certainly related: PCI code doesn't see devices behind
DECchip 21150 PCI bridges
        (used in Dell Latitude). Reported by Simon Trimmer . (Patch from
Martin Mares exists but
        it disables cardbus devices, according to Tigran.) 
        Derek Fawcus at Cisco reports similar problems with Toshiba Tecra
8000 attached to the
        DeskStation V+ docking station. (once again, caused by bridge
returning 0 when reading
        the I/O base/limit and Memory base/limit registers which confuses
the new PCI resource
        code). 
==================
I am the one who reported the "Boot hangs on a range of Dell docking
stations (Latitude)". 
test9 has fixed this problem. Thanks to whoever saved me the time to
poke into this.
I do have a feeling this fixes other reported problems above; maybe people
can test.
This seems more related to second order PCI busses rather than
DECchip 21150 PCI bridges.
 
some details for my case:

----------------------------------------
Having said all that, another problem still needs to be resolved,
but i think that deserves another posting. Summary is: test9 boots fine.
cheers,
