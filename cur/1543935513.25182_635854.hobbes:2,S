Not necessarily.  Whether or not it is requires common sense, and very
often we get enthusiastic new-comers (some of them with very weak C
programming skills :-) who might try to use checkpatch.pl.  So we
can't assume that they will know when a pure clean-up patch is a good
thing, and when it's a waste of everyone's time, including theirs.
That's why I think the warning is a good thing.  It makes it more
likely that this gets communicated to the enthusiastic, well-meaning,
newcomer.  Someone who is more experienced and who knows how to
determine whether some driver is ancient and not being worked on, and
hence a pure clean-up patch won't be screwing up other developers,
will know how to suppress the warning.  (OTOH, how important is it in
the grand scheem of things to create or apply a pure clean-up patch on
a patch that few people if any are looking at?)
