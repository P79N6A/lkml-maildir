Hello,
Could anyone tell me what happened with modversion.h in 2.6.x? I want to
build a module whose makefile indicates that,
ifdef CONFIG_MODVERSIONS
MODVERSIONS:= -DMODVERSIONS -include
$(KERNEL_DIR)/include/linux/modversions.h
CKERNOPS += $(MODVERSIONS)
endif
I checked .config in source tree and yes, CONFIG_MODVERSIONS is defined
as 'y'. But there is just no modversions.h in /include/linux :( Also, I
don't think it is in kernel version 2.4.x.
What the hack is modversions.h? 
Thanks!
Lei
