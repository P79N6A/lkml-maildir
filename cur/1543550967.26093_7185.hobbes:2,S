First we only kill segments with no attachees. There are circumstances
under normal load where you have these. (SAP R/3 will do this all the
time on Linux 2.4) 
So perhaps we could signal shm that we killed a process and let it try
to find a segment where this process was the last attachee. This would
be a good candidate.
If this does not help either we could do two different things:
1) kill the biggest nonattached segment
2) kill the segment which was longest detached
