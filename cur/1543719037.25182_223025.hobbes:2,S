The assumption appears to be true. I tried to vary the total file size and got 
the following results (tests were done on another IDE disk):
2.4.27-pre3:
    2 GB:  58.2707s
    4 GB:  72.3313s
    8 GB:  83.082s
2.6.7-rc1, AS:
    2 GB:  60.6792s  
    4 GB:  82.8023s
    8 GB:  99.4398s
Varying the number of files while keeping the total file size constant also 
gives some interesting results:
2.4.27-pre3, 4 GB total file size:
    1 file:  71.7288s
    128 files: 72.3313s
    256 files: 73.9268
2.6.7-rc1, AS, 4 GB total file size:
    1 file: 76.443
    128 files: 82.8023
    256 files: 81.9618
