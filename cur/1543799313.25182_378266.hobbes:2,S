Sounds okay. But its complex in the way its is coded now and its easy to 
assume that one can call getrusage with any parameter from inside the 
kernel. Maybe we can have a couple of separate functions 
rusage_children()
rusage_self()
rusage_both()
?
Only rusage_both would take a task_struct * parameter. The others would 
only operate on current. Change all the locations that call getrusage with 
RUSAGE_BOTH to call rusage_both().
