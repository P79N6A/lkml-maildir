+The file memory.soft_limit_in_bytes allows users to set soft limits. A soft
+limit is set in a manner similar to limit. The limit feature described
+earlier is a hard limit. A group can never exceed its hard limit. A soft
+limit on the other hand can be exceeded. A group will be shrunk back
+to its soft limit, when there is memory pressure/contention.
+
+Ideally the soft limit should always be set to a value smaller than the
+hard limit. However, the code does not force the user to do so. The soft
+limit can be greater than the hard limit; then the soft limit has
+no meaning in that setup, since the group will always be restrained to its
+hard limit.
