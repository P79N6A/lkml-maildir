I am not sure if that is a good idea, since a lot of the sysctl params in a
directory reference each other or depend on the settings. If you want to
explain concepts (neighbour cache) one sentence can explain multiple
parameters. "wait for x and try y times..."
In the net case for example ipv4/conf/* is such a usefull cluster,
especially since there is this dynamic all/default/<iface> functionality.
And I also think you should not create TODO single-line files, better
collect those in a central TODO file (for each directory), that is less
frustrating for the reader (and still preserves your great work on updating
the list)
BTW: perhaps some markup would be nice so we can create the man pages out of
it? One thing I am impressed with in the BSD world is the existence of
up-to-date Kernel ABI man pages.
Gruss
