I noticed I had a lot of devices created by udev in the disk
(in /dev), including /dev/null, so I removed all, but it
obviously didn't work anymore because without /dev/console init
complains, doesn't start, and reboots.
I guess it isn't that easy to use devfs without any devices in
the disk ?
I'll readd /dev/console.
