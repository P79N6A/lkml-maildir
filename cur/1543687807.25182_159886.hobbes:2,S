Pat, can we have a set of configuration options to disable a lot of the
generic (!) code in kernel/power/*.c which isn't useful on embedded
platforms?
I'm looking at stuff like the swsusp infrastructure for clearing out
memory, suspending to disk, the PM state management, etc?  This type
of stuff isn't at all useful on embedded platforms.
On these platforms, you'd typically suspend all the devices except for
a select few which would cause wake-up, put the RAM into self-refresh
mode, and send the CPU to sleep and put the whole device into a low
power "off" state.
This requires none of the swsusp-like infrastructure, so I don't need
most of the "generic" power code in kernel/power which I get for free
just by enabling CONFIG_PM.
