Well, yes and no ... A valid option here would be to use soft-masking,
which is possible because MSIs are edge interrupts. That is, basically,
when masked, just ignore them and set IRQF_PENDING, and when unmasked,
replay (which can be done with softirq if there is no HW mechanism for
that). The genirq code contains all the necessary infrastructure for
doing that stuff, it's fairly trivial, and would probably avoid stepping
in HW lalaland (how much do you bet HW generally get that masking thing
wrong ?)

Hrm... all right, that will be an issue, so migration need a real
masking.
