That was my initial thought, though you'll note that the same message
is present in the 2.6.7-bk5 boot log.  I'll have to hook up a serial
console to do a real diff of the IRQ initialization.

No, exact same behavior.

AFAICT, Dell's BIOS offers no option for changing the SATA mode.
("Cable Select" for the new millenium! Arrgh!)
If a diff of the boot logs shows nothing useful, I will try backing out
individual patches from patch-2.6.7-bk5-bk6.bz2.
