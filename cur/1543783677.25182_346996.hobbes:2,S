Without the locking, we introduce a race condition.
CPU 0                                           CPU 1
					pci_block_user_cfg_access
						pci_save_state
pci_read_user_config_space
	check block_ucfg_access
						set block_ucfg_access
					other code that puts the device
					in a state such that it cannot
					handle read config i/o, such as
					running BIST.
	pci read config
In this scenario, If the real read on the left happens after the flag is 
set to block user config accesses, then the thread that set the flag 
could go off and start BIST or do something else to put the pci device 
in a state where it cannot accept real config I/O and we end up with a 
target abort, which is exactly what this patch is attempting to fix.
Granted, for the specific usage scenario in ipr, where I am using this 
to block config space over BIST, I use a pci config write to start BIST, 
which would end up being a point of synchronization, but that seems a 
bit non-obvious and limits how the patch can be used by others...

Unfortunately, it is... Every pci config access grabs the lock, so we 
would need to use some special code that did not acquire the lock in 
pci_save_state if we wanted to do such a thing.
