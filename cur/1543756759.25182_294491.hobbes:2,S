Please substantiate your claim that up() is very expensive on ARM.
I disagree:
#define __up_op(ptr,wake)                       \
        ({                                      \
        __asm__ __volatile__(                   \
        "@ up_op\n"                             \
"       mrs     ip, cpsr\n"                     \
"       orr     lr, ip, #128\n"                 \
"       msr     cpsr_c, lr\n"                   \
"       ldr     lr, [%0]\n"                     \
"       adds    lr, lr, %1\n"                   \
"       str     lr, [%0]\n"                     \
"       msr     cpsr_c, ip\n"                   \
"       movle   ip, %0\n"                       \
"       blle    " #wake                         \
        :                                       \
        : "r" (ptr), "I" (1)                    \
        : "ip", "lr", "cc", "memory");          \
        })
static inline void up(struct semaphore * sem)
{
        __up_op(sem, __up_wakeup);
}
Looks like 9 instructions for the uncontended case to me.  If you're
worried about 9 instructions being expensive, please work on GCC to
improve its optimisation capabilities first.  There's room there for
improvement across the whole kernel than just the above 9 instructions.
Plus, after you've read the above code, wouldn't you think that adding
the "enable interrupts + disable interrupts" around an up() operation
(which itself immediately disables interrupts again) is just adding
extra instructions to the kernel, which corresponds directly to lower
performance?
