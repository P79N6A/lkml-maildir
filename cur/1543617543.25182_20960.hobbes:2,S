As I already explained to Denis in private email:
a) It's not "BIOS breakage"; it's standard behaviour for DOS'
   HIMEM.SYS.  LOADLIN must have dealt with it, I don't know through
   what exact method.
b) If we put this in the kernel, real systems will break.  This isn't
   a "maybe", it's a "definitely."
