Some tasks are so cache intensive they would make almost no forward 
progress running for only 1ms.

Your implementation is not correct. The "prio" field of real time tasks 
is determined by MAX_RT_PRIO-1-rt_priority. Therefore you're limiting 
the best real time priority, not the other way around.
Throttling them for only 1ms will make it very easy to starve the system 
  with 1 or more short running (<1ms) SCHED_NORMAL tasks running. Lower 
priority tasks will never run.
