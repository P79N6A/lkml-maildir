Hi,
 please cc me, bcause I am not suscribed to lkml.
I have an Asrock K7S8X with such a 746FX/963l combo.
Networking, IDE is working fine, I am able to access the pci soundcard and a 
hotrod 66 controller. Even watching Tv is fine.
I am burning cds and have no problems to access an usb-stick.
The only setback is missing support in the agpgart, crippling 3d and problems 
with dga.
Kernel is gentoo's 2.4.20-gaming, an 2.5.66-mm1 was even able to boot, but had 
a panic, killing the interrupt handler when loading modules.
ACPI and Local APIC is inabled, enablic IO-APIC gives lost interrupts for the 
Hotrod.
If desired I can test different kernels, send the output of dmesg etc.
My Hardware:
AMD Xp 2000+
Asrock K7S8X
2x256mb ram
Geforce 4mx 440 (Agp 4x)
Abit Hotrod 66 udma 66 controller  (one hd at each channel)
Terratec Tv+
C-Media 8738 based soundcard.
2 hardrives on ide 0
1 cdrw-drive and 1 dvd at ide1
1 usb 1.1 256mb flash stick.
Glück Auf,
Volker
