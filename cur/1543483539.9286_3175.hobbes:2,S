Hi,
I am preparing a report on Java VM performance and I'm including Linux
(blackdown, TYA & TowerJ) in the test, which is to be published in the Java
Lobby.  But I need to get memory usage data and I don't know how to do it.
Sorry for using this list, but it was no help asking in more standard
groups, people just tell me to RTFManpages of thigs like top and vmstat, and
yes I know these tools but they are not good enough for by benchmarking
approach.
Basically, I need a tool that tells me the minimum working set of a process
in some time interval, and the maximum working set too.  In the NT tests I
can do this quite easily with the Performance Monitor.  I don't trust in a
tool that updates numbers and require me to 'catch' numbers before they go
away, and I don't trust a tool that does sampling.
Do you kernel wizards have any special trick for fine profiling / measuring,
that a normal human being like me (who hasn't studied your kernel sources)
can use??  :)
P.S.:  I'm not a Linux/Unix advocate, but so far the results are very nice
for you
thanks,
Osvaldo
