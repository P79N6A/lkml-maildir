Yuk.. This would mean that I _have_ to select CONFIG_BINFMT_MISC in order to
be able to select CONFIG_PROC_FS.. 
Until we have a better configuration-system, such dependencies are REALLY
uggly (can be solved for menuconfig/xconfig though). There are other places
where such a dependency exists. (ide-scsi emulation and config_scsi for
example)

Doesn't this do the same as the current patch?

Yes, it was caused by me. It seems to fix the proc-fs dependency. 
If it turns unusable, that is a problem. But if there is no way binfmt_misc
is usable without PROC_FS with any other patch, maybe we should just #error
or #warning and compile conditionally (your patch 3).
