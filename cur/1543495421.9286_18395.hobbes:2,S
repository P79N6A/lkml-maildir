    Wait.......Andries busted his nuts to get this to work and it took a 2x4
    framing board over my head to believe him.  The fact is that he has a 
    viable option and should be considered.
I won't contradict you, but please - not so impatient.
The two of you are talking as if there is a proposed kernel patch
by me involving HDIO_GETBIOS, but there is no such patch.
On the other hand, there is a patch that I sent to a few people,
maybe including HJLu, you and Alan, that fixes a few problems.
In the meantime I have learned a bit more more about EZDrive,
so that patch has to be adapted a little bit.
A patch along those lines is fit for inclusion in the kernel today.
(Hope to mail you sth one of these days, but not this week -
too many other things.)

    You should note that it is not impliment for full use yet.
    It is present for a test-touch-feel.  Only a fool would try to make this
    standard in its infant form.  If is a direction that needs to be
    considered.
Ah - yes.
[Hope to look at your patch soon - Ah, why are there only 24 hours in a day..]
