Not a "quick hack" at all; boiling down hotplug + coldplug to something
that tight got a fair degree of thought back then.  It takes work to get
things to be small enough to use on very small Linux-based systems.
As for "never been used" ... you can't know that, given that embedded
distros are normally custom built.  I'm certain that I submitted it to
buildroot back then.  So a lot of folk building custom distros have had
access to that, and I'd be surprised if it was "never" used.

A driver named "foo" is usually named "foo.ko"; aliases not needed, or
even desirable.  The kernel source tree has done that for years.

As I pointed out previously, more than once:  it's providing a driver
identifier there, all it needs is to be understood by "modprobe".

You seem like you're being intentionally dense here ... that's rarely
true, which is what makes hotplug-driven driver loading work.
The $MODALIAS thing is passed to userspace after creation of driver
model device nodes.  (Contrary to what you said above.  It's related
to add_device calls, not module loading.)
Normal driver modules do not create those nodes ... and $MODALIAS is used
as a driver identifier so that /sbin/hotplug can "modprobe $MODALIAS" to
load the right driver module.
But *legacy* driver modules are not well behaved; they create those nodes
themselves, rather than letting bus infrastructure do so.  Which is why
they are not hotpluggable.  The $SUBJECT patch just turns off $MODALIAS
based hotplugging for those ill-mannered drivers.
