> Could you try to mute thermal poll?
Done.  The sleep.sh script now has
echo 0 > /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THM2/polling_frequency
echo 0 > /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THM0/polling_frequency
sleep 1

Done.
> The log for S3 suspend success cannot help me to track down.
For completeness, I didn't excise that portion of the log.  It's not
many lines, plus it doesn't make it harder to find the failing
portion: The suspend failure happens after the second "@@@@ SLEEP" in
the log.
Should I turn on more acpi_debug_level debugging?
