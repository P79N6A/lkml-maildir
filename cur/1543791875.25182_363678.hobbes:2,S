Not sure how applications seamlessly can use the proposed hugetlb zone
based on hugetlbfs.  Depending on the programming language, it might
actually need changes in libs/tools etc.
As far as databases are concerned, I think they mostly already grab vast
chunks of memory to be used as hugepages (particularly for big mem
systems)which is a separate list of pages.  And actually are also glad
that kernel never looks at them for any other purpose.
