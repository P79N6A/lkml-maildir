	I am not a parisc developer, but it is apparently the
case for certain parisc machines with "PCXS/T processors" or
the "T class" machines, as described by Mathew Wilcox:
http://lists.parisc-linux.org/pipermail/parisc-linux/2002-December/018535.html
	They currently need the contortions
that are implemented in linux-2.5.50/drivers/net/lasi_82596.c
and partially implemented in drivers/scsi/53c700.c to be
implemented in every driver that they want to use (i.e., what
these drivers try to do when pci_alloc_consistent fails).
	Under the API addition that we've been discussing, the
extra cache flushes and invalidations that these drivers need
would become macros that would be expand to nothing on the
other architectures, and the drivers would no longer have to
have "if (consistent_alloation_failed) ..." branches around them.
