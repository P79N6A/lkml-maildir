What about Andi Kleen patch to not use vmalloc (well, vmalloc is used as a
fallback) when loading modules but instead use big pages?  It is being
integrated in 2.4.20-pre, IIRC. IIRC with that there is still some issues, so
for enlightening the audience here, could you share your view on that patch? 8)
And for _debugging_ IPv4 maybe the modularisation, if Adam was clever, could
help somewhat.
