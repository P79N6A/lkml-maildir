For a RH7.x, at least, there is the /boot/kernel.h file generated on bootup,
and the RH kernel headers include it somewhere.
You can see if the corresponding symbols (coming from it) are defined, and
assume redhat than.
You might consider using passing -dM down to the preprocessor with the
standard driver includes preamble,
and look in the preprocessed output for a good clue - it may well be that
there is some other redhat-specific string somewhere defined.
I guess you will find smth if you egrep -i (rh|redhat).
HTH,

Hi,
How can I determine if the build my device driver is being compiled under is
a standard kernel.org one or a Red Hat one ?
