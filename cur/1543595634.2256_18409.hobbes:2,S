I found one combination where that could happen:
process.thread
A.1: highest priority, runs on cpu0
B.1: lowest priority, runs on cpu1
A.2: another thread of process A, priority
PROC_CHANGE_PENALTY+PRIORITY(B.1)+1, sleeping.
B.2: same priority as A.2, sleeping, same process as B.1
A.1:
{
	wake_up("A.2");
/* nothing happens: preemption_goodness is 0 since B.1 has both
PROC_CHANGE_PENALTY and the += 1 from 'same mm'
*/
	wake_up_sync("B.2");
	schedule();
/* schedule selects A.2 instead of B.2 due to the += 1 from 'same mm'.
BUG: B.2 should replace B.1 on cpu1. The preemption_goodness is 1.
*/
IMHO obscure and very rare. 
But I just found a bigger problem:
If wake_up_sync wakes up more than 1 process then cpus could remain in
cpu_idle() although processes are on the runqueue without cpus.
