I use an IBM X-30 Laptop, based on an i830-Intel Chipset, and experience 
similar problems.
Once or twice a week I get a ro-root filesystem when booting. In that 
case dmesg shows
the line "Trying to unmount old root ... failed"
If I do a 'mount -o remount /' and then a 'rm /dev/null; mknod -m 666 
/dev/null c 1 3' everything
reverts back to normal.
I currently run a SuSE 8.0 Kernel under ext2 - .config, dmesg and lspci 
-vv are attached .
Since I have experienced the problem also with ext3, reiserfs on SuSE 
8.0 and 8.1 kernels
the problems seems to be independent of the filesystem used. I don't 
have a clue what to do next.
Any Ideas?
Michael
