With the current LABEL= support, you won't be able to mount the disks with
duplicate labels, but you can still mount them via /dev/sd<xxx>.  Obviously,
you need an escape hatch to do this.  I ran into this with having two root
partitions (to support multiple distributions or releases of distributions),
where the distribution automatically uses LABEL=.  Fortunately, it was fairly
easy to use e2label to fix things up.

I don't see how this is any different from the current LABEL= support that is
currently in the ext2 filesystem (except I seem to recall that it doesn't work
on devfs).  Of course it would be useful for /proc/partitions to provide the
label IDs and UUIDs.
