  OK, thanks for info. Umm, I don't find it likely that some stale data
in the image would cause this but maybe something could confuse mkudffs
(like it was expecting zeros somewhere where they were not). If you had
some recipe how to reproduce the problem (it would be enough if you had
something like: I have this file, I run mkudffs, mount it, see wrong
free blocks count), I can have a look at it. Otherwise, it's hard to
track it down...
