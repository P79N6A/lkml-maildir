- If a user suspends with a floppy in the drive, it will mostly be an error,
  and he'll unsuspend in order to correct it.
- If it is no error, putting a different/modified floppy into the drive
  before resume is unlikely
- Even if somebody does this, you can mostly detect the different disk
  by comparing the first sector or just the FAT "serial number".
Therefore you can implement a relatively safe resume that will mostly DTRT
but destroy data in some unlikely cases, while doing the "safe thing" would
mostly cause a harmless (unless not noticed) kind of data loss and sometimes
safe you from real data loss.
I think you should let the user choose which foot to shoot.
