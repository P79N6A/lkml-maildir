I thought the prefetches API intended this to be a safe operation?
It's definitely not an issue on ia64: there, prefetches against
uncached memory translations are automatically canceled.
Note that there are many other prefetches in the kernel which may end
up prefetch "invalid" addresses (though it may often be address 0
that's being prefetched; perhaps that OK even on arches where you may
not prefetch against ISA or PCI addresses).

That would work for me (though it would increase code size).  My patch
was intended as a minimal fix for a rather obvious typo (or perhaps it
was a thinko... ;-).
