Sean,
  Sorry for the two messages, but as I was looking at your dmesg I noticed
the line the kills my PC when I enable ACPI APIC in my BIOS:
ACPI: Subsystem revision 20050309
    ACPI-0352: *** Error: Looking up [\_SB_.PCI0.LNK0] in namespace,

Directly after the preceeding my puter hangs. (unless ACPI is disabled)
