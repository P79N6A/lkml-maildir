Subject: [PATCH 12/18] pipe: allow passing around of ops private pointer
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/12/47

relay needs this for proper consumption handling, and the network
receive support needs it as well to lookup the sk_buff on pipe
release.
