That's fine.  Although I admit to being mystified how it works both
before and after the patch, since the cpu_to_le32() calls that were
added should result in byte swapping on PPC that wasn't being done
before.  I guess that either the code paths involved aren't actually
being triggered by my xine DV viewing, or there's some fortuitous
palindromic setting of bits.
