The second output log line of the first printk isn't prefixed
with KERN_INFO.  It's output with log_level_unknown.

Must have copy/pasted the wrong regex
$ egrep -r "printk[[:space:]]*\([[:space:]]*KERN.*\\\n[A-JL-Za-jl-z[:space:]]" --include=*.[ch] * | wc -l

Any sequence of printks can be interleaved.  I don't see

No, just another identifier placed into logs that allow messages
to be reassembled into something readable when multiple printk_block's
are active.

External tool scans logs.  No blocking or delay in output.
