 for original post:
It is not so nice when one can write backup tapes but the tapes cannot
be read. I don't know if memory management or the st driver is the
culprit, but this is a not so nice situation.
I can't even say if the tapes are written correctly as I can't read them
(one does not reboot production machines back to 2.4.x just to try to
read a backup tape - I don't have 2.6.x older than 2.6.20 on these
machines).
