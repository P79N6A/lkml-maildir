Yes, I agree this is a bug. Which functions use the global bit and
assume that flush_tlb_all() flushes them?
* zap_low_mappings()
* kmap: kmap_prot contains _PAGE_GLOBAL, ie all kmap flushes are wrong !
Ingo, could you check that?
I think we have 2 options:
1) flush_tlb_all() clears all page table entries, including _PAGE_GLOBAL
pages. As an additional advantage, this would allow us to mark module
memory as _PAGE_GLOBAL.
2) we remove _PAGE_GLOBAL from all page tables entries that could
change. We could add a special really_flush_tlb_all() macro that is
called in zap_low_mappings(), but that would be i386 specific.
I'd prefer the first option,
