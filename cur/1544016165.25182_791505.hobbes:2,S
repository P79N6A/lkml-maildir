If you would like to make sshd immune from the oom killer, use

just like any other task.  This score will be inherited by any task that 
it executes, so you'll probably want to readjust your shell's oom_adj 
score appropriately in your rc file.

It is userspace's responsibility to set the policy, the kernel merely 
provides the mechanism.

You chose not to respond to this, which is a major flaw in your approach.  
Your patch makes cpuset and memory controller oom killing much slower 
because it requires two iterations through the system tasklist when your 
global oom_victim_name task is either not running or in a disjoint cpuset 
or memcg.

Talk to SGI about oom killer tasklist scans for their large systems; it 
was a prerequisite for me to provide /proc/sys/vm/oom_kill_allocating_task 
to avoid a single scan when I made cpuset-constrained ooms go through 
select_bad_process().
