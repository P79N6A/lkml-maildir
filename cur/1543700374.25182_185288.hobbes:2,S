There are two independant users of fasync_struct
- networking does it's own locking and allocation and uses __kill_fasync 
directly.
- everyone else uses fasync_helper and calls kill_fasync, with the 
locking logic in fcntl.c.
I didn't convert the network code, thus I couldn't add the rcu member 
into fasync_struct.
