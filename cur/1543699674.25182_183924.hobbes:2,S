Months ago I thought using a 3ware card might
help with nforce2 crashes so I gave up on promise
and sii hd cards after a lot of experiments(hdparm,
no lapic, no acpi, apic off in bios) and put in a 3ware
card but I flashed the bios at the same time so didn't
know if the 3ware card helped with the nforce2
crashing or not, since the bios flash did the job.
With 3ware I couldn't use hdparm to see what udma
settings the drives were set to. Now I can report.
Just now I took the 3ware card out and went back
to promise cards(using 4 hd's either method, 2 cd's
on mboard amd74xx, onboard sata disabled).

cd's on amd74xx onboard, amd74xx onboard is always solid,
4 ide hd's on two promise cards. not many nmi ticks without
the better patch there.
bonnie++ smooth, then hdparm up the settings, udma6,
bonnie++ again, saw a few "APIC error on CPU0: 02(02)"
but no lockup. not sure if data lost since it was a test. APIC
error might be fixed by changing hdparm settings. This
second test was with unmasked irq and udma6.
I have to patch to get ioapic edge timer on.
This 11/7/2003 updated award bios does not have a cpu
disconnect option but it does eliminate the crashes with
no patch and it is no longer impossible to use promise
ide udma133 controller cards.
MSI K7N2 Delta MCP2-T mboard
I don't have the promise patch in yet, either, so the APIC
error might be from that, or hdparm unmasked irq.
