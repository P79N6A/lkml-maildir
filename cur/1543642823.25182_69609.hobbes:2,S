We'll send it to you.  Oleg has gone home and trying his cell phone does 
not reach him, but hopefully he will read his email before bedtime.  
It is not the end of the world though if this goes in....  Oleg sent it 
out for testing, a user hit a bug, and then he fixed the bug and it 
worked for the user.  It passed testing by Oleg and Elena and some 
unknown number of users on our mailing list.  If you are going to 
release in less than 10 days, then it needs to be yanked back out 
though.  If you want to yank it back out anyway, I also understand.  
For now we will assume you want it out, and we'll send you the reverse 
for it.
