Yes, most if not all filesystems don't have any information about file
names encoding, but the user can often guess it. Hawing files with
differently-encoded names on the same filesystem is nonsense, which
could only appear because of the current NLS misfeatures.

We already have it in the kernel, it's called nls and it's up to the
file system implementation to decide to use it or not. I don't
contrive something new, I just want the existing system to work a bit
different.
