why bother with remove -> remove_new convention ?  you'll get a
warning in C about the assignment, but you wont get a build failure,
nor should you get a runtime failure ... and if your ultimate goal is
to drop the return value, then this would be better as you'd get
warnings for everything that needs converting.  plus, once .remove is
gone, you're going to have to post another series of patches to
convert .remove_new back to .remove ...
