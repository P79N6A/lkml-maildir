Oh, come on. You are lucky enough to have the alphabet derived from Latin.

Yes? How about we all settle down on UTF-8? MIME may be a good thing or
not, but it's _not_ a solution for internationalization problems. No more
than uuencoded tarball would be. Care to tell me how to put Latin-1 and
Cyrillic into the same text? No? Thought so. How about adding Greek into
the mix? Separate piece for every place where you change the alphabet?
Use of MIME for that is a bad kludge. It happens to work for English+one
more language cominations. Try it for French+Russian and you are in for
trouble. MIME may help to work around the b0rken MTAs that are not 8-bit
clean, but that's about it. It is nothing but a glamorized tarball.
