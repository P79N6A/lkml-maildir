I had a similar problem once... upon quotaoff syscall, the system hung in a 
spinlock or something. I dug deep into the assembly code (using kdb), found 
out it hung, but the source code said it should not, so I recompiled all from 
fresh and it was gone. :-/
Since you are getting a SIGSEGV (not SIGKILL?) at least, you should be able 
to hook gdb on it, and grep the EIP. This is of course will only be the 
userspace EIP, but it may show where it's happening (I guess it will be the 
quota syscall nevertheless).
