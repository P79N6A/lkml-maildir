Richard, you won't be able to re-gain any of the IP addresses, you still
will have to have
1 (network address)
1 (gateway on your local network)
5 useable
1 (broadcase)
it doesn't matter if the DSL connection is internal or external, it is
still a router. If it is internal it just is a router on a card.
