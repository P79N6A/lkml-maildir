The above was with apic enabled. With apic disabled, same story tho different 
boot-time message:
$ cat /sys/../state
suitable:       1
enabled:        1
apic suitable:  1
using APIC:     0
dmesg gives:
Unable to query Synaptics hardware.
input: PS/2 Synaptics TouchPad on isa0060/serio1
and X refuses to start. Same resolution, just reload psmouse.
