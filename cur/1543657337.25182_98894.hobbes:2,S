Subject: [BK PATCH] minor TTY changes for 2.5.53
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/12/30/27

Here are some minor tty patches.  They change the name of
tty_*register_devfs() to tty_*register_device() which makes more sense
as to what the call is doing.  They also get rid of flag that was unused
by everyone but the pty driver for this call.  Also, a tty_devclass was
created, and the usb-serial core changed to use it.  Both of these
patches were posted to lkml previously with no comments.
I also removed some usages of MIN and MAX while I was messing around
with the core tty files, as I couldn't help myself :)
