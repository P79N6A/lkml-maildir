I don't actually agree with that: when nfsd creates a file, it still is a file 
create no matter where it originates from, and so it does make sense to 
provide the appropriate intent information too. Struct nameidata contains 
other crap only needed during an actual lookup too --- that's a mess, and the 
nameidata2 patch shows one possibility how to deal with it. (It's the 
cleanest approach I could think of right now without cluttering the vfs code 
with insane amounts of dereferences.)
Thanks,
Andreas
