True.  We should make the same change to user_shm_unlock(), and we may as
well tweak the excessive spinlock coverage in there too.

and then ask Hugh and Manfred to double-check.
Looking at the callers, we do:
	user_shm_lock(inode->i_size, ...);
then, later:
	user_shm_unlock(inode->i_size, ...);
which does make one wonder "what happens if the file got larger while it
was locked"?
