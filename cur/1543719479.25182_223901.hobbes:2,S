Who says that merging (as it is currently done) is the best way to do?
For examle, I wish to create two terminals with my system, using two
monitors (on dual-head video card), two keyboards and two mices. I can
do the first part (X manages it well) but not beeing able to use
different input devices for different users simply SUCKS.
But
