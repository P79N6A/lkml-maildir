There is the unicorn usb adsl modem driver (STM unicorn chip).
http://www.bewan.com/bewan/drivers/A1012-A1006-A904-A888-A983-0.9.3.tgz
There is some sources and a binary blob to be linked.
The only things I know from the binary blob is that sources should be 150 000
lines of C++.
Driver compile with gcc-3 but not with gcc-4 (because of the binary blob).
