I don't saw any error message... neither the file was downloaded wrong.
Other thing i've saw again is cpqarray.h is looking for a linux/md.h.
The location is wrong, the file is in linux/raid/md.h. This lcoation is
pulled since the raid-0.90 patches for 2.2.5 (IIRC).
I've tried some includes (linux/blk.h, linux/lists.h -- the two files
who contains the QUEUE_EMPTY string), but w/o results.

respect's w/ its owner... mine is looking like disrespect... :)
