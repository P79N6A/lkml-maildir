The functionality that we are trying to add is to allow up to N
simultaneous processors to execute the critical region.  On current
processors/platforms N=1 so a spinlock or mutex would be fine, but
there will be platforms for which N is a small integer greater than
one.  Semaphore initialized to N looked to be the ideal primitive
for this (until Motohiro-san ran the test case that showed the path
where we call this code with a spinlock held).
Next question is whether it is reasonable to get to this code
while holding a spinlock.  Isn't this a problem for architectures
that need to use cross-processor interrupts to do a global TLB
shootdown?
