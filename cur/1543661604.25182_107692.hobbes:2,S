I have had no problem with RH 8.0's glibc 2.2.90 release, which is a
countable number of patches away from 2.3 release anyhow.  It is also
API and ABI compatible.  In short, its fine.
I have recently moved my workstation to glibc 2.3 as from 8.1 beta, and
it too is good.
Only complaint is sched_{set|get}affinity is prototyped wrong... grr. 
And, yes, I reported it and sent a patch to libc-alpha.
