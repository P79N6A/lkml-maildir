I2C and I2C_ALGOBIT are very unlikely to ever depend on anything, so
this isn't a problem.

The Right Way (TM) is to depend on I2C but select I2C_ALGOBIT. I have
plans to hide I2C_ALGOBIT from the configuration menu - the user should
never have to explicitely select it, it's only an helper module. So if
you depend on it, you'll be screwed.
