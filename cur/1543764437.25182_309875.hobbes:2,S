Yes, some quotes:
The memory access type of a location affects the behavior of I-fetch,
load, store,
and prefetch operations to the location. In addition, memory access
types affect
some instruction descriptions. Load linked (LL, LLD) and store
conditional (SC,
SCD) have defined operation only for locations with cached memory access
type.
SYNC affects only load and stores made to locations with uncached or
cached
coherent memory access types.
3. The SC [comment: store conditional] 
stores a new value into the memory word, unless the new value has
been modified. If the word has not been modified, the store succeeds and
a 1
is stored in the destination register. Otherwise the Store Conditional
fails,
memory is not modified, and a 0 is loaded into the destination register.
Since
the instruction format has only a single field to select a data register
(rt), this
destination register is the same as the register which was stored.
Load Linked and Store Conditional instructions (LL, LLD, SC, and SCD) do
not
implicitly perform SYNC operations in the R10000 processor.
