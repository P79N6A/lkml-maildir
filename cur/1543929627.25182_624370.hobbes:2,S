Thats a relief.  Jan's report was embarrassing enough. :)

If you are seeing the allocation failures both with and
without my original patch I doubt that an improved version
would work.  In my case, the BIOS had allowed sufficient
resource for the expansion ROMs but was expecting the kernel
to get it from the non-prefetch instead of prefetch window.
In your case, it sounds like there just isn't enough resource
available for expansion ROMs from either window.

Like I said above, I doubt that an improved version of my fix
would help your situation.

Me too.
