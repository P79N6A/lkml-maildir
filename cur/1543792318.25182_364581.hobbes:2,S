So that I can avoid that spammin' feelin' ... 
I'll send patches against -git10, then, so as to start with a clean
slate; unless you wanted something aginst -mm1?
"The whole series": do you want all 42 patches? Or just the seven
discussed today?
-----
In the series-of-42, the staging of some of the patches in the 
middle require simultaneous update to both the drivers/pci/hotplug
and the arch/powerpc/xxx; otherwise, build breaks result. I am
not sure how to handle that: the obvious solution is to split these
up... but that will probably result in a bigger series, and was
not a step I wanted to take unless someone asked...
