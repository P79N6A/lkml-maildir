i know longer have the source tree from what the opps was generated
from that was actually the 2.4.19 opps i posted but the kernel is now
2.4.20 it was the same trace and same place in the file i tracked it to
this point.
From 2.4.20 tree line 333 ide-scsi.c
333:    if ((status & DRQ_STAT) == 0) {     /* No more interrupts */
                if (test_bit(IDESCSI_LOG_CMD, &scsi->log))
                        printk (KERN_INFO "Packet command completed, %d
bytes transferred\n", pc->actually_transferred);
                ide__sti();
                if (status & ERR_STAT)
 338:                    rq->errors++;
                idescsi_end_request (1, HWGROUP(drive));
                return ide_stopped;
        }
 the oops occurs on line 338
i know its only error counting on that line but rq->errors is used
in idescsi_end_request as well which from what i can work out if it
never hits the limit it will keep retrying on the drive for ever. Then
i start to get lost / confused ....
I cant retrigger at the weekend if you wish and provide all uptodate
information on it.
