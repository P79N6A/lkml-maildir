Just to be sure we eliminate all confusion (and it amazes me how
frequently this comes up), could you add some words DMA-mapping.txt to
make clear that this new API does not address PCI posting (which is a
problem with onward write cache flushing in the PCI bridge)---otherwise
I can see device driver writers thinking that
pci_dma_sync_to_device_single(... DMA_TO_DEVICE) will flush posted
writes.
Thanks,
James
