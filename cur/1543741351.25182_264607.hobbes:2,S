I think this is *bad* idea. In such case, userland would see
Fn-F3. My notebook has "sleep" key on Fn-F3, but your notebook
probably has something else there. You'd need another mapping in
userspace...
I believe Fn-F3 on my machine is meant to be replacement for hardware
sleep button (and it has sleep label on it!), and we really should
generate sleep event for Fn-F3...
