Subject: [PATCH 2.5] Enable ALIGN #undef for drivers/net/defxx.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/12/29/109

The following patch #undef's the variable ALIGN in include/linux/cache.h
so that drivers/net/defxx.c can use the same variable. Patch has been
tested and defxx.c compiles. Please apply.
