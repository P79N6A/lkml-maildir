Since both of you seem to know about the (possible) problems, maybe you can
take a look at my patch.
http://7eggert.dyndns.org:8080/tmp/autounlink.patch
(Not inline, because it would be duplicate in this thread.)
(Yes, this patch needs some cleanup. I just did checkpatch.)
First I thought I'd modify tmpfs to delete the file on O_CREAT, but it
turned out tmpfs will increase the dentry count in order to prevent the
delete-on-close effect. Skipping this step was allmost enough, I had to
prevent link() from pinning these files, too.
Some loops creating files or linking them did not show any decrease in
available memory, and to the best of my knowlege, I did not introduce new
memory leaks. And the best thing is: It's only 150 bytes of code. Not bad
for an additional mount flag, is it?
