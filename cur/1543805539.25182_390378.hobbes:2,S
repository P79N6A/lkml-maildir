That's right, but
 Also note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as the kernel
 is concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not
 v2.2 or v3.x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated.
Linux specifies version GPLv2 and only v2. Therefore, for Linux the GPLv2 is 
the default.
