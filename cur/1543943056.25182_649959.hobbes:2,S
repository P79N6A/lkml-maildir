That's probably me being a pain in the ass and actually looking at the pull
requests.  Sorry, I really should look at these things as they go into
people's trees, not as they attempt to come out of them.  I'll do better.
Although that's not an option with some of the stealth merges we're seeing
lately..
I'd assume that by now you can apply whatever touchups are needed then
resend the pull request.
