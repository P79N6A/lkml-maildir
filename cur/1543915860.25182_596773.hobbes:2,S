I see. I'll wait for next version.

poll_table is defined in include/linux/poll.h .
To change this, we have to do "sed -i -e 's:poll_table:struct poll_table:g'"
against all in-tree files atomically.
Also there would be many out-of-tree files using poll_table.
I think it's too difficult to change.
Thank you.
