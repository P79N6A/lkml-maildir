LOL, Christoph, Christoph...  No, folks at IBM working on CKRM aren't
cowards, you'll see most of them on ckrm-tech or working with distros
or end users of the code or writing new code.  You've seen them at KS
and OLS.  Many are soaked up into a couple of other deliverables at
the moment but they'll be back.
We've needed some help in stabilizing and aggregating the code and so
we are using my copious free cycles.  And, no, silly Christoph, I'm no
manager and never have been.
Yes, I've read the code, yes I cleaned up a bunch of it.  But rather
than me sitting on it forever cleaning, I figured I'd shake it out and
get more eyes providing feedback which is where LKML is very handy.
Lots of eyes making sure that it is useful and minimally invasive never
hurts.  And stewing it around just ckrm-tech is great for functionality
but less great for converging and cleanup.  Hence, time to get this
into the wider eye of the community, including yours.
If you see needed cleanups, send me patches.  If they make sense, I'll
integrate.  If not, I'll go back to that training class on how to
deal with Christoph on LKML.  ;-)
