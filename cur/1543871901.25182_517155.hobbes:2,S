Let's do this. How about you throw this way one of the case that would 
possibly break, and I test it?
Queues are separeted, so if you have a signal hitting you while in 
signalfd_dequeue, either the signal is not for your set (and you'd get an 
EINTR ATM), or it is for your set too, and signalfd_dequeue will return 
with it.
But again, I'd love to have some insides about possible breakages so that 
I can make test cases for them.
