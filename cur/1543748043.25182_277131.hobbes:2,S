This seems a bit silly. If the stack pointer (esp) is ever negative that's 
clearly a bug somewhere. So instead of testing it for <0 and then setting 
your regs_esp variable to 0 it would make more sense to me to just 
BUG_ON(regs->esp < 0) or something, if you want to do anything at all. And 
if you want to silence the warning a exlicit cast to unsigned long should 
do I'd say, but I have a feeling the best thing is to just leave that 
warning alone, the code seems to be fine.
Also, your declaration of regs_esp interspaced with code (which is allowed 
by C99 but not C89) will break on C89 compilers, some of which are still 
supported - such as gcc 2.95.3 for instance.
