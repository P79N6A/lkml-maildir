And set up distros to grant it by default.  Yes.
The problem I see is that it lets user space priorities invade the range of 
priorities used by root processes.  What's really needed is a range of 
negative priorities available to normal users that are not normally used by 
root.
In retrospect, the idea of renicing all the applications but the realtime one  
doesn't work, because it doesn't take care of applications started 
afterwards.
