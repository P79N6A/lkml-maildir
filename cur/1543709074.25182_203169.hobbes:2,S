Nope, the node_zones[] array is indexed by
#define ZONE_DMA		0
#define ZONE_NORMAL		1
#define ZONE_HIGHMEM		2
Whereas the zonelist.zones[] array goes the other way:
[[[highmem,]normal,]dma,]NULL.
It's a complete dog's breakfast that stuff.  Hard to understand, not very
logical and insufficiently commented.
