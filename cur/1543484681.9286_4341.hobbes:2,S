Hello!

Because instead of:
> ppp.connected.machine   ether :00:34:(mac address of eth0)  MP eth0
it shows:
> ppp.connected.machine  *   *    MP  eth0
which is equivalent. 
BTW it is also redundant, because it is easier to disable proxy arp
in pppd options, and to say instead:
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth0/proxy_arp
