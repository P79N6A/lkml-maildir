> Please replace which with "command -v" which is required by SuS in /bin/sh.
command -v breaks on some setups. One problem can be seen easily by doing this
# command -v ls
alias ls='ls --color=tty'
Because I build kernels with several compilers for several architectures I have
gcc aliased, and I am sure I am not alone in that.
I'll play with the proposed which based fixes first, unless you have clever
ideas ?
