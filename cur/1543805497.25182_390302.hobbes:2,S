Hello
I have /dev/tun on my system and would like to read documentation about
it. Because I already know that /dev/ttyS0 has manual page under man
ttyS, I typed
man tun
No manual entry for tun
also info tun
No menu item `tun' in node `(dir)Top'.
I also tried "tun" and "/dev/tun" at Wikipedia and they have nothing.
