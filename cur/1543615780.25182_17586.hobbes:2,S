You're the men :)
Ok, this stops all the talks Ingo.
Can you send me a link, there're different things to be fixed IMHO.
The load estimator can easily use the current dyn_prio/time_slice by
simplyfing things a _lot_
I would suggest a lower number of queues, 32 is way more than necessary.
The rt code _must_ be better, it can be easily done by a smartest wakeup.
There's no need to acquire the whole lock set, at least w/out a checkpoint
solution ( look at BMQS ) that prevents multiple failing lookups inside
the RT queue.
