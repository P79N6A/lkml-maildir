Also sometimes the authors know it's hackish, or just don't expect it
to be generally useful to the world.  I happen to own an out-of-tree
filesystem which I have little desire to have reviewed for mainline:
only a dozen people use it at most, and I know it would get pinged
mercilessly for using buffer heads and general insanity if it ever
made it past "use FUSE instead" (which would admittedly be a perfectly
fine response).  It works though, so I keep it up to date with the VFS
changes.
I do have some interest in working on various device drivers, though.
Greg, assuming this somehow kicks off some avalanche of specs, will
there be a ML for hooking up driver writers with specs and willing
users?
