Its well accepted that reiserfs3 has some robustness problems in the
face of physical media errors. The structure of the file system and the
tree basis make it very hard to avoid such problems. XFS appears to have
managed to achieve both robustness and better data structures. 
How reiser4 compares I've no idea.
