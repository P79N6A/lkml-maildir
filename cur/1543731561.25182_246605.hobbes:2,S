For the file system case there is setfsuid. You can also make use
of seperate effective/real/saved uids through setreuid() and friends.
setfsuid() also addresses the other problem - if a process switches
fully to my ID then I can play with it - kill it etc.

This is actually not hard to do if your server is designed to be a
little smarter. The apache model doesn't fit it well although apache
could make some use of setfsuid() as unfsd (user mode nfsd does) and it
does support doing this through suexec.
One little non-obvious trick that might make this work faster would be 
to keep track of running webdav servers for each active user and use 
a redirect from the main server to communicate with it, and when the 
client has idled out to reclaim it and hand the port back to the main
server instance so that users get redirected again

sshd can already do this. The "run as root" desktop feature already
exists using the existing auth functionality (see "usermode")

Actually its easy to implement and horrible to get right - there is no
locking on uid changes. When a task is in a syscall the entire syscall
knows that the security for the process will not be changing.

Have fun - the security stuff is hard but getting something working as
you describe for learning purposes and armwaving that issue should be
nice little project.
