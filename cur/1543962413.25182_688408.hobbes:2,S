Thanks, but this uses CONFIG_SECURITY_APPARMOR which isn't enough to tell if 
the kernel has the patch.  Lets go back to Jeff's suse patch:
/*
 * Even if AppArmor isn't enabled, it still has different prototypes.
 * Add more distro/version pairs here to declare which has AppArmor applied.
 */
#if defined(CONFIG_SUSE_KERNEL)
# if LINUX_VERSION_CODE >= KERNEL_VERSION(2,6,22)
# define REMOVE_SUID_PATH 1
# endif
#endif
Could someone from Ubuntu please suggest a replacement for CONFIG_SUSE_KERNEL 
and KERNEL_VERSION(2,6,22) that would correspond with ubuntu kernels shipped 
with apparmor?  We don't need some define from the apparmor patch, just a 
global flag that says it comes from ubuntu is enough.
