	The 2nd value is wrong!
	8,715MB are 8.5GB - and not 8.7GB!!!
You are wrong.
8715 MB is precisely 8.715 GB.
We had this entire discussion a few weeks ago, and
you can read all about it in the archives.
Probably I wouldnt have answered but in the meantime
I encountered a few more data points:
- Not only is G = 10^9 the SI standard, also the IEEE
  decided that 1 GB = 10^9 B, that is, the SI standard
  must (by IEEE compliant engineers) also be used w.r.t.
  computer memories.
- There is a proposal for a name and prefix notation
  for the binary 2^20, 2^30 etc, namely Mi, Gi etc.
  Thus, if you want to show off as a real hacker that
  cannot be bothered with this decimal stuff, and you just
  bought a 17 GB disk then you can call it a 15.8 GiB disk.
  See for example,
