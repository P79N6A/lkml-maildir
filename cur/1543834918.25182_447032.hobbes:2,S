And, by that token, the newborn is sometimes preferable.  It hasn't had 
time to develop severe emotional problems, it's physically harmless, and 
you get to help it form its ideas and beliefs.
On the other hand, the 8 year old is potty trained, you won't have to 
change a single diaper, it's intelligent and makes you question things, 
it understands what you want it to do...
So, it depends what kind of developer you are, what kind of gatekeeper, 
and what kind of project it is.  I still believe in releasing early and 
often, but I can see many reasons not to.  Some are financial -- Namesys 
is trying to operate a business, so any features they open up too early 
could be that much harder to sell as a commercial product.  The 
repacker, for instance.
I'm not arguing for closed source, I'm just saying that once you open, 
there's no going back.  Many times it's a good thing, but sometimes you 
want to wait and see.
