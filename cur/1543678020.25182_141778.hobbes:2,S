Hey, we've tried. I realize it's missing details, and though I know it's 
important to keep it updated, many other things take precedence.

It's "bound" to the device, but it does not own the object. 
Note that only recently have we realized the full importance of creating 
attributes _only_ for objects that you own. It's exposed bugs recently, 
and hasn't had a chance to make it in to the documentation.

If it does not fit into the existing classes, then there is probably a new 
class that needs to be created for it. While you're at it, please update 
the documentation and set a good example for the rest of us ;)

Yes.

It should be in the first sections of each driver model paper - The 
hierarchy under /sys/devices/ represents the physical hierarchy of the 
system itself. Each object represented in it is intended to map directly 
to a physical device. Physical devices are discovered and registered by 
bus drivers in the system.
