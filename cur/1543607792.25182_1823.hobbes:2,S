Thanks for the pointers.
Currently only the link status is used to monitor a NIC.
So it would be nice if an ioctl was available to force a NIC switch-over
(especially in active-backup policy). This could be used by a user-space
daemon in case for instance no traffic is detected.
I see that the bonding driver is included in 2.2.18, what is its status
in 2.4.x ?
