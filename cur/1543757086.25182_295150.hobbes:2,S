PA-RISC already has a compat_sys_waitid ;-P
The reason it isn't in Linus' tree yet is that it depends on the
is_compat_task() predicate which Andi vetoed out of Andrew's tree.
As a result, I haven't been able to merge any of the compat stuff
sitting in the PA tree.  A few more voices in favour of reintroducing
is_compat_task() would help.

Some subtle differences which I feel incompetent to diagnose ... ours
looks like:
asmlinkage int compat_sys_waitid(int which, pid_t pid,
                                 compat_siginfo_t __user *infop, int options,
                                 struct compat_rusage __user *ru)

Other than variable names, we're identical to this point:
        /* Tell copy_siginfo_to_user that it was __SI_CHLD */
        ksiginfo.si_code |= __SI_CHLD;
        
        if (compat_copy_siginfo_to_user(infop, &ksiginfo) != 0)
                return -EFAULT;
        return 0;
}

to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
