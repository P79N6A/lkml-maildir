As simple as it may be, it's a bit of a shame that we actually need rootdelay 
as its something that the kernel should do automatically. At the time when we 
last discussed it, we didn't come up with a better (and safe) way to handle 
it, but I don't think we considered anything like your implementation.
I've CC'd a few people who were involved the last time around to see if they 
have any input for you.
