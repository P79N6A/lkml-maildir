I had them all flashed to the latest current version which was 2.20.0.15
when i started having problems. Each card was verified to that version as 
well. Some did have older firmware on them.
The same problems were seen before / after flashign the card. As far as i 
could tell the promise bios will run form the first card and init the 
other cards it could be configuring something there which nobody else is 
aware of. However this only showed drives / drive interfaces form the 
first 2 cards never the 3rd card. After the bios has init'ed the carss 
the bios doesnt run on any other cards.
When booting the machine will 3 cards and no drives attached the bios is 
loaded and unloaded 3 times. This is why i belave something is getting 
enable / disabled on the other cards by the bios.
