mmap64() is there too. It's just called "mmap2()", because it doesn't
actually have any 64-bit arguments: it just exports the internal "page
granular" offset interface.
The only major lack that I know of is the flock stuff, and that's at 
least partly because the patches I had broke old binaries for some reason.
I don't consider it a show-stopper.
The other minor thing I still want done is the 32-bit uid/gid thing, but
it's another of those things where I want to think about it before
applying patches (and like the LFS patches, I probably won't end up
applying them all at once, but do it my own way in pieces, building up
the infrastructure..).
