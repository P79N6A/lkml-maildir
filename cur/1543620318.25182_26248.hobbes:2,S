   Actually, at this point we _know_ page->list.{prev,next} are
   NULL.
   
   We can use this to add the pages to a special list, from where
   __alloc_pages() and kswapd can move them to the free list, in
   process context.
I don't think there should be any special logic on how to free a page
outside of the page allocator itself.  Certainly this kind of stuff
doesn't belong in the networking.
Pages can be freed from arbitrary contexts, and the page allocator
should be the part the knows how to deal with it.
Maybe I don't understand and you're really suggesting something else.
