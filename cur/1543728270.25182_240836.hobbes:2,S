Folks,
2.6.8-rc4-mm1 panics when booting (aic7xxx) with lots of SCSI ABORT
and sens code errors.
IDE ports give also failed probe messages.
This is on AMD/nForce2 based system under Slackware 10.0 with
2.6.8-rc4-mm1 kernel compiled using GCC 3.3.4. Last kernel that worked
was 2.6.8-rc3-mm1.
The 2.6.8-rc3-mm2 flag pci=routeirq which Andrew suggested works and
boots this kernel.
Below is the full dmesg/lspci output.
Thanks,
Paul
