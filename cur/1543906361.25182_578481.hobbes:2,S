That machine has no active thermal trip points, so I'm not sure how it's 
relevant here. By the sounds of the bug log, I suspect Linux just runs 
slightly hotter on the machine than Windows does - especially since the 
user isn't running the closed nvidia driver, so there's nothing to carry 
out any power management on the GPU.
