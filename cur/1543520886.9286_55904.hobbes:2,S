IMHO, programs that depend on overwriting argv members without regard to
checking for buffer overflows are broken, especially from a portability
standpoint.  The space for the args is allocated on the user stack at
exec time, and the limits are stored in the mm struct for the task (this
is from binfmt_elf.c).  If you exceed that space you will spill into the
space for the environment variables.
And if I am not mistaken, this is not new to 2.3.35.  A quick look at
2.2.14 shows it works the same way.

What you are doing here is changing the pointers in the argv array,
which proc_pid_cmdline does not follow.  Maybe that is the fix - have it
follow those pointers instead of reading directly from the preallocated
string space.  That way programs can point to their own strings and not
have to check how much space was allocated at exec time.
