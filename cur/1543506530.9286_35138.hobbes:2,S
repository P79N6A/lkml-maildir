  The 'reversed diff' was related to the modedb.c file, not the matroxfb.c
one. And anyway, the problem remains the same with .15-pre2...

  Well, may be that with gcc 2.95.1, the section attribute can be specified
for local variables, but gcc 2.7.2.3 doesn't permit that.
  So my question remains: what is the right way to fix this? Should we
put this declaration in the global scope or should we just drop the 
__initdata section attribute?
