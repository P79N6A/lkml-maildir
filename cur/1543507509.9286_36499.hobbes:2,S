It sounds more to me like you have been reading too much government
propaganda instead of thinking about what it actually means.
The US crypto laws are naiive and only hurts US businesses since the
crypto is already out there. It's like saying we are the only ones
smart enough to do crypto, but hey the rest of the world proved them
wrong again. Maybe they'll learn one day, the current laws are so
naiive it is unbelievable, it's hard to decide whether to laugh or
cry over it.
Anyway this is off topic for linux-kernel, if you want to reply do it
to me in private email please - I'll probably just ignore it anyway.
