But then it needs some other syscall to let applications determine 
hardlinks --- which was the initial topic in this thread.

I see them. The bad thing is that many programmers read POSIX, write 
programs as if POSIX specification was true and these programs break 
randomly on non-POSIX filesystem. Each non-POSIX filesystem invents st_ino 
on its own, trying to minimize hash collision, making the failure even 
less probable and worse to find.
The current situation is (for example) that cp does stat(), open(), 
fstat() and compares st_ino/st_dev --- if they mismatch, it writes error 
and doesn't copy files --- so if kernel removes the inode from cache 
between stat() and open() and filesystem uses iunique(), cp will fail.
What utilities should the user use on those non-POSIX filesystems, if not 
cp?
Probably some file-handling guidelines should be specified and written to 
Documentation/ as a form of standard that can appliaction programmers use.
