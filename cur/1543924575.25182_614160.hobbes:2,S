True, I've changed it to use "!info->flags & ASYNC_CLOSING" condition
for now, as this is a more non-intrusive patch.
I will look at using completion later, at the same time as using
spinlocks instead of volatiles.

Good idea, I've done that too for the new patch.

Also excellent point, have done so.

There are some differing opinions on that here, it should probably not
reach this unless there is a configuration error, and so it more like
a debug-help. I'll put this on the "to clarify" list.

Agreed, I've changed them to u8 instead. The space saving is
not worth the aggravation.

The driver uses old volatile style synchronization. Changing over
to spinlocks is like I mentioned on my todo-list.

True, old compatibility code, removed in the new patch.
