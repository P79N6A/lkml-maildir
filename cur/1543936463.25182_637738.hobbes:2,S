As PCI-X2 bridge/chipset, I only knows about the AMD-8132 (from what I 
understand it does PCI-X Mode 2), and some obscure IBM enterprise 
chipset (I am sure there are a few more).
Too bad for the spec, but we definitely know for sure the AMD-8132 
doesn't do ext-space (and makes it unusable for any device behind it).

mmconfig has been a pain on the servers too (there are a lot of server 
class amd machines using one pcie/mmconfig/chipset + amd-8131/2).

Sure it might be needed on PCI-X2. But contrary to pcie (where the 
driver/pci/pcie/aer subsystem already use ext-conf-space, and other 
usages are bound to increase), needing ext-conf-space in the future on 
pci-x2 is quite unlikely (pcie is long-lived, whereas PCI-X2 was 
short-lived, obsoleted by PCI-E, and nobody has mentioned yet an example 
of using ext-registers with a PCI-X2 device).
I was only mentioning that because of the very small trade-off:  if you 
don't exclude PCI-X2, on platforms with the amd-8132+bad-MCFG, you might 
trigger a cfg-read==0xffffffff/master-abort in pci_cfg_space_size() for 
such devices with Ivan patch. This is harmless, because a lot of similar 
master-abort happen during PCI-probing anyway, so one more won't change 
anything.
Anyway, I am equally happy with keeping pci_cfg_space_size() as it is.
