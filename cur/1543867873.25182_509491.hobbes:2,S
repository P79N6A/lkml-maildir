Sometimes  it is better for the caches to initialise an object
immediately, but in this case I think it is better to use the
slab ctor because it is very unlikely to use many cachelines
immediately anyway.
It would be nice to put the "why" in the changelogs, rather than
"what". Not everyone wants to go through the whole patchset to
decipher why Xen possibly needs something.
