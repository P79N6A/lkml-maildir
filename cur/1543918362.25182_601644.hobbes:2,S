No, I just meant "2.6.24 merge window", so:

is the correct interpretation.
It will probably be a day or two after the 2.6.23 release, just because I 
like evertybody to look at the release tree after a release, but it would 
be the first set of changes that get merged (assuming there are no stupid 
brown-paper-bag issues that would get priority).
