Hello,
I am facing a strange problems with an old 1.2 GHz P-III machine with
a 10 GB disk (used as a dedicated web server, later retired out of
service!).
Out of interest to implement some wireless solution (experiment), I
did compile 2.6.20.7 for my requirement. Strangely, I did observe:-
hda: drive_cmd: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: drive_cmd: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
ide: failed opcode was: 0xb0
What might be the problem?
