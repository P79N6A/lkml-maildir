But note that you can get more pathname information by enabling the
kernel syscall auditing support, i.e. boot with audit=1.  Then, whenever
SELinux generates an audit message during syscall processing, the audit
framework will also generate an audit message on syscall exit that
includes parameter information, including the supplied pathname (for
what it is worth).  Those audit messages can be tied together based on
serial number.
