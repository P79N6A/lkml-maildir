curious.
i remember from the Tigon2 days, it didn't matter if you used a NetGear 
card, an Alteon card, or an Alteon card ripped out of the inside of an 
ACEDirector switch -- they were all the same reference design.
i don't believe that anyone using the bcm5700 would deviate significantly 
beyond the reference design - there wouldn't be any reason to.
(the only variants are probably due to dual-port versions ... of course, 
i'm sure the tg3 driver authors will now correct me on the differences. 
<grin>).
cheers,
lincoln.
