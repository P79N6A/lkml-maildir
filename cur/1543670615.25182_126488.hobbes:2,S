Hmm, if we are breaking already every driver, how about gettting rid of 
the pt_regs argument. The timer interrupt is the only real user and it can 
also be stored in irq_desc_t, from where the timer can get it with the 
irq number.
To preserve compatibility we could add something like this for 2.4:
#define alloc_irq(irq, handler, flags, name, id) \
	request_irq(irq, (irqreturn_t (*)(int, void *, struct pt_regs *))handler, flags, name, id)
bye, Roman
