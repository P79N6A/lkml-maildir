Well, the zone->protection code is in the tree but disable by default 
(Andrea's lowmem_reserve effectively enables/adjusts it, apart from changing
"protection" to "lowmem_reserve", etc).
The zone protection setup code doesnt configure any protection
for DMA zone with reference to GFP_KERNEL allocations. 
It only sets up protection with reference to HIGH zone, I think.
There must be some reasoning to explain why its disable now?
Who wrote the zone->protection code, Andrew?
