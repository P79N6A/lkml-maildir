It makes more sense to export the devices (non-disk, ROMB) on the physical
channel at their actual address. That the reason virtual driver were pushed
out to virtual channel

Yes, typedefs are evil. Is there are good reason to prefer __u32 since
driver conventionally uses uint32_t. The latter definition is available to
userspace as well, right?

Not pad, possible future expansion of the definition of this packet.

The scsi megaraid stack does not have unique identifiers for the logical
drives, and when it happens for future FW, it may not be 32-bits. But you
are right, we should accommodate for this eventuality.

For megaraid_mbox, the max limit is 40LD, 64LD is defined in the
mega_common.h, which will be valid for other stacks.

Unfortunately, the mid-layer does not allow initiator id per bus, for
multi-bus devices like megaraid. Since, we have to reserve initiator id for
physical channels, it carries over to virtual channel as well.
This also explains why MAX_LOGICAL_DRIVES_64LD is defined as (64+1)!, since
we lose one spot for initiator id.
