No, a normal user shouldn't be able to crash any unix box with proper
limits in place, this local DoS only works if there are no limitations.
Please people, this is a 20 year old trick that I'm really tired of
hearing come up every other month.
It's called a forkbomb with a twist, it's old, boring and doesn't
affect people with properly configured systems.
Please consult your Operating System's documentation on how to setup
limits. 
If you want to know why random processes are sometimes killed then
you need to buy and read an OS book.
thanks,
