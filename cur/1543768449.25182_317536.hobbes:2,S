I agree with Ram.  This whole recent flurry of activity seems to be
going down a path which will end in tears.  I think Miklos' patch for
allowing user mounts and Janak's patch were both more or less the
direction I'd like to see us moving.  Let's hold off on all these
freaky shared-namespace and passed-namespace semantics until we get
the basics in place and get some experience using them.
