The Jens' patch passes the residual byte counts to __blk_end_request(),
so __end_that_reqeust_first() should never return 1 and we should never
BUG() on the residual byte counts, unless inconsistency happens such as
the size of remaining bios is bigger than the residual byte counts.
So if __blk_end_request() returns 1 even with the Jens' patch,
it means that the block layer or the driver really have a bug.
And then, the request and the bios could leak or the issuer
would wait forever because end_that_request_last() isn't called.
The previous behavior might ignore such inconsistency and leak only
the bios because it was calling end_that_request_last() anyway.
I would like to BUG() in such cases personally, but I don't object
strongly if you prefer not to BUG().
