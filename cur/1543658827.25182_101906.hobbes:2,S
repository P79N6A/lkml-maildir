Subject: Unable to boot kernel-2.5.50 to kernel-2.5.55

Hi.
This might be wrong mailinglist, but I don't know else
to to.
I am having a Dell Optiplex GX240, 512 MB RAM, ATI
RAGE 128. I am using Gentoo GNU/Linux. 
I have installed module-init-tools-0.9.7. 
I have difficulties in booting development kernels.
I am using GRUB as boot-loader, and can choose between
different kernel-2.4 series and kernel-2.5.  
I am passing root=/dev/hda3 to all kernels. 
My screen turns black and the computer reboots, when I
try to boot a development kernel. 
I havent't applied Rusty's patch for PCI and USB,
because I thought it was for kernel-2.5.50. Is it
necessary? 
I'm using pretty much the same config-file in
kernel-2.5 as in kernel-2.4. I have tried to disable
all framebuffer support, but nothing happened. 
Should I try another version of GRUB?
How should the config-file for kernel-2.5.5x look
like? 
I am trying out development kernels, because I like
being in bleeding edge, when it comes to computers. 
Have to challenge myself...:-)
Cheers, 
Ole J.
