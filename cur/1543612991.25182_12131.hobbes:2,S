We did read through your page awhile ago.  It wasn't clear to me
how you were addressing Anton's questions here:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-fsdevel&m=97260371413867&w=2
(I couldn't find a reply in the archive, but may have missed it).  
We were concentrating on something that could be fs-independent,
so the lack of answers there put us off a bit, and the dependence
on a reiser4() syscall is pretty filesystem-specific too (I guess
if your solution is intended to be a reiserfs-specific one, then
the questions above are meaningless).
I was curious on another thing also - in the section titled 
``The Usual Resolution Of These Flaws Is A One-Off Solution'',
talking about security attributes interfaces, your page says:
	"Linus said that we can have a system call to use as our
experimental plaything in this. With what I have in mind for the
API, one rather flexible system call is all we want..."
How did you manage to get him to say that?  We were flamed for
suggesting a syscall which multiplexed all extended attributes
commands though the one interface (because its semantics were
not clearly defined & it could be extended with new commands,
like ioctl/quotactl/...), and we've also had no luck so far in
getting either our original interface, nor any revised syscall
interfaces (which aren't like that anymore) accepted by Linus.
many thanks.
