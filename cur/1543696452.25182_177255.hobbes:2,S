And then someone comes along and says that feature X isn't working in
some version. He then reports that "it worked in a.b.c but then someone
broke it for a.b.c+1 pre 1. Then you have to tell that person that
a.b.c+1 pre 1 isn't newer than a.b.c. Messy. Very messy.
The list gets too many mails that are answered by "RTFM" already.
