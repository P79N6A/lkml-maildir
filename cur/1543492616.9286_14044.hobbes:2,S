This would be very good for Arla too, since right now, I'm doing some
magic just to make it install the inode into the passed dentry.
I'm not quite sure what semantics you are proposing, though. If
real_lookup receives a normal pointer from ->lookup, what does it do
with the passed dentry? Just dput() and use the new value?
