If my understanding of the new kbuild and configure system is correct,
make clean and dep should be largely unnecessary and it should be possible
to build a patchbot that checks for incremental compilability:
for the current kernel release:
  unpack tree
  build the tree with default options (unprivileged user, obviously)
  for each patch in queue:
    copy tree (-a)
    apply patch
    if rejects:
      bounce("doesn't cleanly apply to kernel x")
    if not includes linux/patch.changelog:
      bounce("doesn't include changelog entry")
    if not includes linux/patch.config:
      bounce("doesn't include possibly empty config options")
    for each option in patch.config:
      if not (cml2 --new-enable-option-from-command-line-feature option)
        bounce("config option x couldn't be enabled")
    if not (make): bounce("couldn't build patch: <diags>")
    remove copied tree
Optimize above to deal with dependencies in the patch queue.
Then we need a web interface that allows rejects with various canned
messages:
  applied, thanks
  redundant
  obviously incorrect
  doesn't meet coding style (partially automatable with lindent)
  too ugly to live
  breaks code freeze, resubmit later
  submit to appropriate maintainer
  missing MAINTAINER entry
  insufficient documentation
  insufficient rationale
  forgot configure.help text (automatable)
  (custom message, of course)
  (drop silently)
