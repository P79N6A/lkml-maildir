No, I haven't get chance to do it yet. Please feel free to take it.:)
Laurent did some ground work for the filesystem wide physical block
number in his 64 bit ext3 patches. He changed physical block number from
"unsigned long" to "sector_t", that's probably a good start.
BTW, I think we should have one more:
typedef long ext3_grpblk_t; # block offset in the block group
