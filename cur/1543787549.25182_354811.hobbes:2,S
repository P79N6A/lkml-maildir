reiser4 spinlock macros provide following functionality:
    (1) encapsulation of locks: instead of writing spin_lock(&obj->lock),
    where obj is object of type foo, one writes spin_lock_foo(obj).
    (2) keeping information about number of locks of particular type currently
held by thread
    (3) checking that locks are acquired in the proper order.
    (4) collection of spin lock contention statistics
I agree that (1) is not very necessary. (2) and (4) helped a lot in early
debugging. Now we are about to remove it.
However, we would prefer to keep (3). It makes catching spinlock deadlocks very
easy. Don't you think that makes sence?
Thanks
