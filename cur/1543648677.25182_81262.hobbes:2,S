I realize I didn't pick the right words (from my poor English 
dictionnary) : I meant an extend remapper rather than a block remapper. 
As far as I can see, this task can be done entirely from userland : 
o per-extend IO counters exported from kernel-space can be turned into 
  a list of extends sorted by activity 
o lvdisplay-like tool gives the mapping extend<->physical blocks 
o a scheduled job in user-space should be able to massage this info to 
  decide where to move low-access-rate-extends to the border of the 
  platter and pack high-access-rate-extends together ... all in one run 
  that can be scheduled at low activity period (cron defrag way) 
The algorithm could be something along the line of : 
while top_user_queue_not_empty 
do 
  extend = dequeue_lowest_user_extend 
  if extend_in_good_spot 
  then 
    move_extend_to_corner_destination 
    find_highest_user_extend_in_bad_spot 
    move_this_extend_to_freed_good_spot 
  fi 
done 
This sort of extend reordering is done in some big Storage Arrays like 
StorageWorks EVA110 (as far as I know : they are very secretive on the 
subject).
