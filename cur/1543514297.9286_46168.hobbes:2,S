As I see it, the ONLY part of all this that belongs in the individual
tty driver is this part:
 1. When the driver is called to probe for the relevant hardware,
    it finds the state flag set to NOT-HERE.
 2. If the driver finds the relevant hardware present, it sets
    the state flag to FULL-DUPLEX.
...and possibly also this part...
 3. When the driver gets called to do anything later, it checks
    the state flag, and if it finds it set to NOT-HERE, it just
    returns an error based on that fact. If it finds it set to
    any other value, it ignores the specific value and just gets
    on with its job.
...although that would probably be better placed higher up. Basically,
the line disciplines will need to be able to rely on the fact that the
state flag saying NOT-HERE guarantees that the hardware is not present
and the ONLY place where that decision can be made is when the code to
determine whether the hardware is present is actually run.

Ah...can I apologise for that, but I was wording it as seen from a
user level application. Seen from that viewpoint, the serial hardware,
the line discipline, and everything in between, all comprise a single
unit that normally gets referred to as "the serial port".

Nodz - and LOL at your phraseology...
Best wishes from Riley.
