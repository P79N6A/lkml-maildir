There is a case where this can happen, yes, but I admit it's not the
common one...most DV's are kicked off without a thread from user context
(either in the initial scan or by user request).  The common case where
we use a workqueue is if an asynchronous event that alters the transport
agreement comes in (mainly a bus reset) via an interrupt.

It's not just locks (hopefully there shouldn't be any of these).  It's
also device states.
For instance, DV will attempt to quiesce the device (i.e. wait for it's
currently outstanding commands to complete).  Thus, I can't use the
cancel/flush method in any code path (such as may be called from error
handling) which could itself be part of the completion path.
This dependence is caused by having to wait for everything that could
potentially be on the workqueue to complete.  I'd really prefer an API
that didn't have this potentially nasty entanglement, which is why I
coded mine to only do the wait if the piece of work being removed was in
the process of executing, but not otherwise.
