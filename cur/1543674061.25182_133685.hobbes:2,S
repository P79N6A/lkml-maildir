spin_lock yes on x86, but spin_unlock isn't a two way barrier even on
x86. Other archs like ia64 have special ways to declare the direction of
the barrier so they can do it for spin_lock too, not only for
spin_unlock like on the x86.
In short stuff outside the critical section can anways enter inside
unless a full mb() is executed either before or after the
spin_lock/spin_unlock. Never rely on a single spin_lock/spin_unlock to be a mb().
In short:
	spin_lock
	spin_unlock
is a mb().
But:
	spin_unlock
	spin_lock
is not an mb (and the above is what we have in our code, and this is why
I had to add the mb(), of course we just agreed it can be reduced to
smp_rmb()).
