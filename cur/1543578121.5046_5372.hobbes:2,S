	Excellent, this patch certainly sounds interesting which is why
I've been following this discussion.  Once the MOSIX patch for 2.4 comes

	Yes, very much so actually now that I think about it.  Alot of
memory->device and device->memory work going on.  I was mainly replying
to the idea of clustering since that's what MOSIX is all about.
