Ouch. Not exactly a little nice hack...

I'm not surprized! It would be cool for RT hackers, but it isn't exactly
beautiful...
To me it sound like the problem should be solved on some other level.
Problem is; where? Where's the narrowest place to do the cut? What I see
is sync problems between RT "kernel" mode and real kernel mode. Making
the sync primitives RT aware/safe? Am I missing some important problem
here? (I haven't studied the application->kernel mode switch yet...)
