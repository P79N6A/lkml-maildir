Some people consider it worth it for their memory restricted systems
and would like to drive the annotations even further. [1]
My experience while fixing section bugs during the last years is that 
the __dev{init,exit}* are actually the main question since they are both 
the majority of annotations and the ones that bring benefits only 
in a case that has become very exotic (CONFIG_HOTPLUG=n).
All the other annotations either both bring value for everyone
(plain __init* and __exit*) or are nothing normal drivers would
use (__cpu* and _mem*).
People at linux-arch (Cc'ed) might be better at explaining how often 
CONFIG_HOTPLUG gets used in real-life systems and how big the savings 
are there.
That might be a good basis for deciding whether it's worth it.
