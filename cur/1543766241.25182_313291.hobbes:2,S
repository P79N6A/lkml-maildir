Not good if you use a crypto private header as long as there's arch and
device specific crypto which is left out cold this way.
I'd suggest either some header in include/linux or, in my opinion
better, open a crypto related include directory as include/crypto. The
latter would make sense as there probably will be algorithm specific
headers when the arch and driver specific versions will be harmonized,
thus these headers need to be globally available to crypto sources but
otherwise would pollute the common include directory.
