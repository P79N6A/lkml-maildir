						  ^^^^^^^ + offset
I added some stuff in the shm threaded test program to verify
correctness after swapin and it showed userspace mm corruption on the
nonlinear pages, the above + offset is the fix.
I also merged anobjrmap-6 from Hugh so ppc and ppc64 compiles fine (plus
some other arch).
Also the race in do_anonymous_page couldn't trigger, the callers of
try_to_unmap always first check if the page is mapped after taking the
page_map_lock, so I'm backing it out.
The real race triggering such bug is that I'm not taking the
page_map_lock for all the pages before unmapping them so the
--page->mapcount aren't atomic while the page is unmapped by different
address spaces at the same time from multiple cpus.
It'll all be fixed in the next update.
