If someone wants to go through individual lmbench metrics
and find regression points, I have some data that I believe
is mostly very good.
There is lmbench info for a lot of 2.4 and 2.5 kernels in
these pages:
http://home.earthlink.net/~rwhron/kernel/k6-2-475.html
http://home.earthlink.net/~rwhron/kernel/old-k6-2-475.html
They are from 2 different Linux OS's, but the same piece
of hardware.  It would be best not to combine them because
of the OS differences.
If anyone feels like grabbing any of the data in my web
pages and graphing it, feel free to do so.
If you have any specific questions or want even more
data/background let me know.  I'd love for the data
to be more useful.
There is another page with a slew of quad xeon benchmarks.
