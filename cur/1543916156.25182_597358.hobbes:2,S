This assumes that setting an atomic_t to the all-zeroes pattern is
equivalent to atomic_set(v, 0).
This happens to be true for all present architectures, afaik.  But an
architecture which has crappy primitives could quite legitimately implement
its atomic_t as:
typedef struct {
	int counter;
	spinlock_t lock;
} atomic_t;
in which case your assumption breaks.
So it's all a bit theoretical and a bit anal, and I'm sure we're making the
same mistake in other places, but it's not a change I particularly like..
