Answering those questions implies that TOE is a good idea.  That still 
is still an open question.
The community has been _trying_ to dialogue with people interested in a 
progressive solution that actually addresses the problems we raise.  I 
haven't seen a single response.
I don't see any dialogue at all.  The examples I have seen so far are HW 
vendors saying "we are doing TOE" not "should we be doing TOE?"
DaveM has been dropping ever-more-blatant hints about an efficient 
design.  Who has listened?

Not all hardware vendors.  One specific hardware vendor, with decades of 
experience in TCP/IP and Unix, realizes that TOE is not the answer.

This is trivial.  Just create your own character device driver and go to 
town.

TOE is vastly different.
As Alan said, nobody is stopping developers from maintaining their own 
TOE fork of Linux.  Under Linux, forks are _encouraged_, remember.
