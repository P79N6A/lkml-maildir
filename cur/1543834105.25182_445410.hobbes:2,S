I have a laptop. It does not have enough RAM.
Due to the fact that the local hard disk is quite slow seeking - I've 
experimented with swap over wifi to a servers ramdisk - which lets me 
run more stuff till it slows down.
This works very well until there is a wifi problem - at which time 
everything dies.
While there are partial 'solutions' in some cases - lock stuff in RAM, 
... I was wondering about a more general solution.
It would be really nice to be able to simply: chown crashalot.users 
/dev/swap0 ;swapon /dev/swap0
Then anything run by crashalot would swap to /dev/swap0 - and not locally.
If it crashes, then firefox/whatever else bloated that they were running 
simply dies.
I assume this is not currently possible.
How much work would it be to get it to be so?
