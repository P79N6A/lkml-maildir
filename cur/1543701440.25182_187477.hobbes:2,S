Well, but if random device numbers become a reality, udev would have
to run at boot time or I wouldn't get usable device nodes. So there
is some setup complexity (because so far I don't need a correctly setup
hotplug system at all). Not much of a problem, granted, distributions
will do this for most of us and only a few people will do it by hand.
