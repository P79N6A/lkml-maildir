It sounds then like it would be a good start to have general socket
namespaces, if it would merge more easily - perhaps then network device
namespaces would fall into place more easily.
AIUI socket namespaces are also necessary for situations where you want
containers to share IP addresses. AIUI, PlanetLab do something like this
with a module atop of VServer already (but read
http://openvz.org/pipermail/devel/2006-June/000666.html
 for a proper
explanation from Mark Huang)

There were many objections, the major one being the patch was too large for certainty of adequate review.
Quoting what I perceived as a summary from Eric:

You offered to re-do the patch without separate lists - I suggest that
this go ahead. No-one should really care; splitting it out into separate
lists can then be considered a performance optimization for later.

I think this is the comment he refers to:

Both quotes are from

Though, in Kirill's defense, it seems a bit strange to expect him to
raise a fault that was just raised by Eric, in a reply to the message
where he raised it.
