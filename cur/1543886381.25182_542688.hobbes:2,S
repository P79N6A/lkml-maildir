sg elements. It's not new, just juggled around a bit. The comment is a
bit stale now though, it doesn't have to be a pow-of-2. Ideally we just
want to make sure that sizeof(struct scatterlist) * SCSI_MAX_SG_SEGMENTS
<= PAGE_SIZE to avoid 2^1 allocations.

Agree, I did consider that (clear wait, set ATOMIC to get the __HIGH).
