I was working on the same thing myself.  I don't have a working
solution, so you beat me, and thus good job.  I think we need this, for
various reasons, especially to implement a method of setting task
affinity that we can export to userspace.
I am a little surprised by how much code it took, though.  Do we need
the function to act asynchronously?  In other words, is it a requirement
that the task reschedule immediately, or only that when it next
reschedules it obeys its affinity?
Also, what is the reason for allowing multiple calls to
set_cpus_allowed?  How often would that even occur?
