schedule:
	if (unlikely(prev->flags & PF_DEAD))
		prev->state = EXIT_DEAD;
Which means: "If PF_DEAD is set, ignore ->state value. It should be TASK_RUNNING,
but we have to change it, otherwise the task won't be deactivated. We are using
EXIT_DEAD (which should live only in ->exit_state) because other TASK_XXX values
won't work".
So in my opinion PF_DEAD has already slipped into the ->state partly. And I still
think that at least the first patch is ok, it does not change the things, but may
be considered as microoptimization.
On the other hand this microoptimization is negligible, all cleanups is a matter
of taste always, so let's forget about it if you don't change you mind.
Oleg.
