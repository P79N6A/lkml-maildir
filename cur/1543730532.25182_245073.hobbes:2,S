	Linus, sorry but I can't agree with your decision.
    I'm not a developer, just an user and for me at least, there's no
sense in supplying a patch related do 2.6.8 instead of 2.6.8.1.
	I always update my kernel when the official patch is announced and
I'd expect to follow a well defined order (2.6.8 -> 2.6.8.1 ->
2.6.9...).
	Suppose we had 2.6.8.1, 2.6.8.2, 2.6.8.3 until 2.6.8.10. Should I
remove 10 patches just to update to 2.6.9? For me it's a waste of time.
	I know you kernel developers use BK or some other method, but...
	Thanks.
