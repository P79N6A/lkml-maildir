Nope, kept OOMing and killing everything .

Well, I didn't try that, but even looking at man pages got oom killed,
so I guess not ... were you looking at the cat /dev/hda1 to fill pagecache
or something? I have 16Gb of highmem (pretty much all ununsed) so 
presumably that'd fill the highmem first (pagecache?)

Will try again. Presumably "find /" should do it? ;-)
