Actually, with regard to using a pseudo filesystem interface, I said that
we could investigate it, but I have doubts about cleanly supporting the
extended forms of existing calls (e.g. execve_secure, mkdir_secure,
msgrcv_secure, recvmsg_secure, etc) using such an interface.  I
raised the same issue when sys_security was originally discussed on
the lsm list long ago.  SELinux extends the POSIX API to incorporate
security (specifically flexible mandatory access control) as a first class
notion.
However, I understand Christoph's objection to sys_security and am not
trying to revive that debate.  We can hopefully have a dialogue about the
SELinux API with the kernel developers at a later time and come to some
consensus on a set of specific system calls that can be added to the
kernel to support equivalent functionality to the SELinux API.
