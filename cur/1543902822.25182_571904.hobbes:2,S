CFS does measure time elapsed across task-sleep periods (and does 
something similar to what the old scheduler's 'sleep average' 
interactivity mechanism did), but that mechanism measures "time spent 
running during sleep", not "time spent idling".
still, CFS needs time measurement across idle periods as well, for 
another purpose: to be able to do precise task statistics for /proc. 
(for top, ps, etc.) So it's still true that sched_clock() should include 
idle periods too.
