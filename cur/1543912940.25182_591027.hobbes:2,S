I don't much care.   But we do have the infrastructure for it in the
kernel and NFS uses it.  And it seems like a nice way to preserve user
space backwards compatibility, without making the code to nasty.
If we don't mind that bit of change that would make it harder to
upgrade a kernel I don't mind not doing it.  It just looks like a
elegant way to handle that implementation change.
