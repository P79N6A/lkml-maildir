Yes, I think it will work with current CPU's, I'm just worried about
future state extensions.
That said, I personally certainly prefer this approach which is guaranteed
to set as much as possible to a known state, even in the presense of
future extensions. If future extensions don't like loading zeroes, at
least the state will be _consistent_, which on the whole is really the
most important thing.
Applied.
