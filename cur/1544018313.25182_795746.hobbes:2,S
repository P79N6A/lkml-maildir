Ok.
Oh but I haven't seen that Oleg said he prefered bug_on, because the
system will deadlock instead....hmm...
Or perhaps keeping the things like the old way, but with a WARN_ONCE:
if (cwq->thread == current) {
               /*
                * Don't ever think to flush workqueue from a work
                */
               WARN_ONCE(1);
               run_workqueue(cwq);
               active = 1;
}
And then, the workqueue will flush...so it will behave correctly but
will warn on this bad developer idea of flushing from a work.
Actually I don't understand when Lai says that it will actually not flush.
