Hi,
Is /proc supposed to support chmodding of directories?
$ cd /proc/net
$ ls -ld
dr-xr-xr-x    3 root     root            0 Jan 29 23:21 .
$ sudo chmod 755 .
$ ls -ld
drwxr-xr-x    3 root     root            0 Jan 29 23:21 .
$ cd rpc
$ ls -ld ..
drwxr-xr-x    3 root     root            0 Jan 29 23:21 ..
$ cd ../
$ ls -ld
drwxr-xr-x    3 root     root            0 Jan 29 23:21 .
$ cd ../
$ ls -ld net
dr-xr-xr-x    3 root     root            0 Jan 29 23:22 net
/proc itself can be chmodded permanently, as it's a mount point,
but what I see here it a bit odd.  /proc/net -- or seemingly any
other directory in /proc -- can be chmodded and will retain the
mode until the cwd of the chmodding process changes to a parent
directory of the chmodded directory or leaves /proc altogether.
(The new mode persists while the cwd stays the same or if it
becomes a subdirectory of the chmodded directory.)
This can be replicated on on 2.3.40 and 2.2.14.
