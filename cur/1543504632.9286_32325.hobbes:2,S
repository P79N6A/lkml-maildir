2.3.10 works fine.  I haven't tried 2.3.11.
It doesn't even put up the /sbin/init version message.  And it's not just
/sbin/init that dumps - init=/bin/sh dumps also.  I haven't tried any
others.
I do get a core dump, but no diagnostic messages on the console.  It just
quietly dumps and hangs.
Is there any additional information that I can provide that would be
helpful?
What can I do with that core dump to get more information about the problem?
Any ideas what might be causing this?
Regards,
Brad
