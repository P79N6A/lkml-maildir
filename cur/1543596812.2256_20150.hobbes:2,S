I had a patch about a year ago that did it safely for the block layer
and IDE at least, and also for selected SCSI hba's. Some of the latter
variety are pretty hard and/or tedious to fixup, Eric Y has done some
work automating this process almost completely. Until that is done, the
general patch has no chance of being integrated.
It's also interesting to take a look at _why_ there's contention on the
io_request_lock. And fix those up first.
