To inject a bit of concrete into this discussion, I note that block
devices with dynamically assigned don't work with CONFIG_DEVFS and
devfs=only.  Block devices -require- majors currently, due to those
!@#!@# arrays.  However, devfs_register_blkdev always returns zero when
devfs=only, even if its a block device and a dynamic major is requested.
