Hi there.
I now have my own cd-writer, and have split the currently known
kernels onto CD's. They currently split into three volumes, as
follows:
 1. Volume 1.
	All 0.* series kernels.
	All 1.* series kernels.
	2.0 through 2.0.14 inclusive.
	All patch files for the same.
 2. Volume 2.
	2.0.10 through 2.0.33 inclusive.
	2.1.0 through 2.1.83 inclusive.
	All patch files for the same.
 3. Volume 3.
	2.0.33 through 2.0.36 inclusive.
	2.1.83 through 2.1.132 inclusive.
	2.2.0-pre1 through 2.2.0-pre9 inclusive.
	2.2.0 and 2.2.1
	All patch files for the same.
In addition, volume 3 has room for an estimated further 6 kernel
tarballs and associated patch files - and before anybody asks, the
overlap between volumes 1 and 2 in the 2.0 series kernels is to allow
for the inclusion of further 0.* series kernels, currently missing
from the collection, as they turn up.
If anybody would like copies of these CD's, please email me privately,
as suchlike is not appropriate on here. I'd anticipate charging £10
for volumes 1 and 2 combined, inclusive of post and packaging.
Linus: If you would like a set, just ask - in my opinion, you've done
more than enough to deserve a set, so your set would be free...
Best wishes from Riley.
