I don't think this is what Linus was talking about. The current problem
is that at many places the drivers (not the generic layer) know too
much about stuff, which should be handled entierly on the genric device
type layer. And changing this is actually a *prerequsite* to change
the type of dev_t.
For example please grep for the MINOR() macro in the scsi layer...
Most of the places where it's used should be replaced by a simple
driver instance enumerator. I did this once already, so this is for
sure.
