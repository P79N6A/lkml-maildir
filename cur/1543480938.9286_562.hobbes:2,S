Apparently, the recent 2.1.x kernels, and the 2.2.0-pres are less tolerent
of serial ports using the same irq. After checking my inittab, and
commenting out the getty that was sitting on ttyS3, all was well with
ttyS1 again. All the 2.0.x kernels had no problems accessing ttyS1, with
the getty running on ttyS3.
My serial setup is as follows, ttyS3 has had no cable attached since I
burnt out the vt320 that was attached to it. I had even forgot the getty
was there. So if you having serial problems in the 2.2.0-pres, and not in
2.0.x check your inittab, especially if you have a similar setup.
ttyS00 at 0x03f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
ttyS01 at 0x02f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
ttyS03 at 0x02e8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
Thank you all for your help,
Mr. Shannon Aldinger
