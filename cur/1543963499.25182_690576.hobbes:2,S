Yes, this change is harmless.  I'm reworking (ie. rewriting) stop_machine at 
the moment to simplify it, and as a side effect it won't be yielding.  (The 
yield is almost useless, since there's nothing at same priority as this 
thread anyway).
I've included this patch for my next push to Linus.
Thanks,
Rusty.
