Still there is lspci. Much better than just a file in /proc, in fact:
you can have short or long output, and you always have device and
vendor names (with /proc/pci it isn't true).
As long as the database contains the names, of course (the same as with
kernel, with the difference that it doesn't use kernel space).

Same as "ps xaf". I usually don't look at /proc/*/cmdline etc either.
This doesn't mean I want a file in /proc which contains "ps axf" output.
Anyway, /proc/pci is currently broken (the kernel don't know what
hot-pluggable devices will you use, and doesn't preserve the necessary
names). If we want it in /proc, could it be corrected?
I always thought of /proc/pci as of temporary q&d debug tool.
