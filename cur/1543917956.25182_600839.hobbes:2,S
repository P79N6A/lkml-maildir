Or third ;)
Yes, I've always argued, that permission checking needs to be pushed
to the filesystem, since the VFS can't always do a good enough job.
My usual example is sshfs, where it is just impossible to know the
uid/gid mapping between the server and the client.  So any permission
checking based on uid or gid on the client simply can't work, the only
sane thing to do is to delegate the permission checking to the server.
Which works beautifully, since the server is an unprivileged process,
and everything automatically works out.
All the fuse kernel module has to do is to basically define
->permission() to always return success, and let the userspace
filesystem do the permission checking.
This works fine, except a couple of things, like checking the sticky
bit on a directory, and mknod().

Because we need MNT_NODEV on _all_ mounts belonging to a superblock,
not just the one on which mknod was performed on, which would get
really ugly.  This way it's simple: if the MS_MKNOD_NOCAP is specified
for the super block, that implies, that devices can't be opened.

See above.

I imagine this flag to usually be set by the filesystem itself.  But
it could be a separate mount option.  I guess it could make sense in
some non-fuse cases as well.

Yes, that's one of the options, but it would be a huge change, with
nasty security implications for past and future filesystems.

I think there's consensus on the need for a new mount API.  Not just
because the 32 bits for the flags will be exhausted sooner or later
anyway, but the current API is limited in lots of other ways.
