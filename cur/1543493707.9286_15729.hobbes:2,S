Indeed the NFR group being a BSD outfit from the beginning dont like
Linux, they set up their tests knowing ahead of time it would do badly
with their BSD-specific code, did the comparison tests, then jumped up and
down going "nyah nyah, Linux sucks". They have been anti-Linux for as long
as I can remember.
