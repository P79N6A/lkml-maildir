This assumes that you can see the global vfs namespace right?
What if you are inside a container/vserver which restricts your vfs
namespace? i.e /dev/cpusets seen from one container is not same as what
is seen from another container ..Is that a unrealistic scenario? IMHO
not so. This in-fact lets vservers and containers to work with each
other. So:
	/dev/cpuset
		|- C1	<- Container A bound to this
		|  |- C11
		|  |- C12
		|
	        |- C2	<- Container B bound to this
		   |- C21
		   |- C22
C1 and C2 are two exclusive cpusets and containers/vservers A and B are bound 
to C1/C2 respectively.
From inside container/vserver A, if you were to look at /dev/cpuset, it will
-appear- as if you are in the top cpuset (with just C11 and C12 child
cpusets). It cannot modify C2 at all (since it has no visibility).
Similarly if you were to look at /dev/cpuset from inside B, it will list only 
C21/C22 with tasks in container B not being able to see C1 at all.
