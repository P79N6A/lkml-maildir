And that's where you have problems. You shouldn't do that, and that's why
/proc is such a nasty beast right now. 
If you want to look at other peoples processes, then the onus should be on
_you_ to do all the extra crap that normal processes do not need to do. 
That extra crap can be a number of things, but you shouldn't penalize the
normal path (which is to touch only your own mm space). 
For example, the thing I suspect we'll have to do in the long run for
/proc is:
 - get the process while holding the tasklist lock, and increment the page
   count so that even if the process exists, the page does not get unused.
 - get the kernel lock. Now we know that we're atomic with regard to
   __exit_mm()
 - look at tsk->mm: it it is not init_mm, you're now safe, because
   __exit_mm is called only with the kernel lock held. 
See? No spinlocks.
