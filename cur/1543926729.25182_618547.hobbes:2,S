Ah, that.  Yes, I see your point.
However, using PF_NOFREEZE to prevent this from happening doesn't seem to be
a good idea.
I'd probably use wait_event_freezable() (defined in include/linux/freezer.h)
for that.

No, you're not wrong and I have overlooked the problem.

It tries to send them fake signals and waits for them to freeze.  If they don't
freeze within the timeout, it fails and clears their TIF_FREEZE bits.
