Thanks for the ideas from different people. I've started to take a copy of
/proc/modules and /proc/ksyms on an every-two-minutes basis, so should have the
latest versions if it goes down again. I hadn't realised that things change
depending on the module load order. (Are there any other things from the running
system I should backup in case of a crash?)
I'm considering going to a later kernel, as it's been pointed out that this
version is quite old. It is that version because it is a recompiled Debian one
with a couple of additional patches (like QLogic qla2x000 support). Hence why I
posted here not the Debian lists...
I'll ignore the Debian kernel next anyway if I go to 2.6, as they've annoyingly
stripped the qla modules out. Ho hum.
Of course, it hasn't crashed again yet. I'm still waiting to see, as I'd like to
find out what is causing it!
Thanks!
