kmap_atomic doesn't qualify as alternative. It's limited to two free
mappings. There must be something else to kmap in softirq. I really
can't imagine such a limitation.
Where is the documentation for the highmem stuff anyway? It's stunning
that there is not a single useful hit in ./Documentation for kmap_atomic
or kmap. The web is also close-lipped about that issue.
I can't code for the case of two. Because, first, that's the idea of
generic in the name "generic scatterwalk", second, I need at least 3
scatterlists in parallel for LRW.
