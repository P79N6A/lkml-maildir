I've eliminated 2.6.19.1 as the culprit, and also tried toggling "optimize for 
size", various debug options. 2.6.19 compiled with GCC 4.1.1 on an Via 
Nehemiah C3-2 seems to crash in pipe_poll reliably, within approximately 12 
hours.
The machine passes 6 hours of Prime95 (a CPU stability tester), four memtest86 
passes, and there are no heat problems.
I have compiled GCC 3.4.6 and compiled 2.6.19 with an identical config using 
this compiler (but the same binutils), and will report back if it crashes. My 
bet is that it won't, however.
