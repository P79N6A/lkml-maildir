Actually, that gives us exactly the scenario catastrophic reseeding
intends to avoid. Presume for a moment that the internal state of the
PRNG is somehow known to an attacker - the PRNG has been broken. If we
take eight bits out of the entropy pool, mix them in, then generate a
new random number, an attacker needs to only test 256 possible pool
states before he knows the entire state again. If he keeps up this
state extension attack, /dev/urandom will never return to an unknown
state. If, on the other hand, /dev/urandom waits until there are, say,
64 entropy bits to mix in, it can make a leap to a state that the
attacker will have a very hard time guessing and the PRNG has
recovered.
We merely need to avoid starvation of /dev/random, and I think a
straightforward low watermark approach will do that nicely. Starving
/dev/urandom is no worse than feeding it a trickle.
