Yes. With 4 GB of RAM, so I use PAE, which is also required for NX. Just
to be sure, I disabled PAE, and sure enough, the problem disappeared.
I'll double that the commit I fingered actually caused the problem, but
I will not have time for this before tomorrw evening. 
Just to be sure: If I want to checkout the revision, just before the bad
commit I can do something like:
git checkout commit-id~1
Right? 
Thanks for spending time on this.
