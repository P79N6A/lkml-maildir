I've spent a few horrible hours terrified by the idea of a possible XP
install on my new laptop. It's a Compaq Presario 3045US with SIS-650
chipset and there was no way to have USB bits work with it because of a
IRQ routing issue. The PCI routing table of that machine issues requests
for 0x60, 0x61 and 0x63 that, to have everything to work out, must be
handled like the 0x4* cases. Now, while 0x60 and 0x63 were ot documented
at all, 0x61 was documented as IDEIRQ and I was a bit worried about that.
But this is not the case since the machine issue 0x60..0x63 for the four
OHCI devices. Now USB is working great with keyboard, mouse and drives. I
still have to say bye to the Broadcom 54g wireless interface though ...
