I am reluctant to say that I ack this patch for a couple reasons:
1) We are talking about a basic logging facility that should be open like 
printk() is.
2) There are no user space GPL restrictions to use the audit netlink API, so 
why restrict who can send audit events via the in-kernel interfaces? It just 
doesn't make sense to have 2 different licenses for in-kernel vs user space 
audit event recording. Its the same subsystem differing only by where the 
event originated.
3) The API has been unrestricted for years. I don't think its a good idea to 
take a basic logging API away from people that have programmed to it.
4) In the absence of the in-kernel audit logging api, people will either 
create parallel infrastructure or resort to using printk. It will be 
difficult for end users to correlate security events from 2 different logs.
I would support there being a mechanism for anyone who wants to reduce the 
number of exported symbols for their own kernels - I believe that is the 
basic problem here. But I think there are enough reasons to continue keeping 
this API open and unrestricted for anyone that wants it that way.
