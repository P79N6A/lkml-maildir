What were you using? cdparanoia? cdda2wav? (Are there actually that many
other options on Linux?)
This may well be a userspace problem, where your ripping program doesn't
perform enough integrity checks on the data it's just read, and ide-scsi
happens to make things slow enough for errors to not occur?
