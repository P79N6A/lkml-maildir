So... what went wrong with broken-out-2007-11-20-01-45.tar.gz?

Often when people base a patch on -mm it is worse than basing it on
mainline - I usually prefer patches against mainline; partly because that's
less work for originators too.
But sometimes it doesn't work out very well.  There's lot of stuff
outstanding again.  Immediate problems are from an x86 exec randomisation
thingy in git-x86 and pie-executable-randomization.patch in -mm, which both
hit on binfmt_elf.c
