36x"Fantec (was MaPower) DB-335U2-1" with Genesys-Logic-Chipset (at
least the model i used yesterday said that. I bought this 36 enclosures
in the time from May/2005 - October/2006, so it is possible that they
use different chipsets and/or revisions of the chipset)
2x"IOmega 33644" bought last week, with a Chipset that says it is from
IOMega, but i guess it is just a rebranded.
I have errors with all of them.
I have a spare enclosure Fantec DB-35U2-2, AFAICT it uses a
Cypress-Chipset which i haven't used for some time, so ATM i don't
remember if i had it with this one too.

Real Programmers consider "what you see is what you get" to be just as
bad a concept in Text Editors as it is in women. No, the Real Programmer
wants a "you asked for it, you got it" text editor -- complicated,
cryptic, powerful, unforgiving, dangerous.
