anonmm has no problem with most mremaps: the special case is for
mremap MAYMOVE of anon vmas _inherited from parent_ (same page at
different addresses in the different mms).  As I said before, it's
quite conceivable that this case never arises outside our testing
(but I'd be glad to be shown wrong, would make effort worthwhile).
