I don't like the patch - it removes the safety net.
initarray_cache is __initdata, and is replaced with actual data after 
the kmalloc caches work, but only for the cpu that performed the 
bootstrap (end of kmem_cache_sizes_init())
With your patch, the pointer to the head arrays of the other cpus still 
point to an __initdata variable. It's even oopsable, if a 
CPU_ONLINE_PREPARE is failed by another subsystem.
What about the attached patch?
