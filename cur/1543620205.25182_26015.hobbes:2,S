I can justify the opposite view: ".config" _IS_ a "script used to control
compilation": just look at how it's used.  The "Makefile" (that is shipped with
the sources) does an "include .config" to incorporate the contents of ".config"
into the compilation process, so IMHO it easily qualifies.  If fact, some
distributions ;-) include the ".config" files as a matter of course.
