It seems that for LAPIC and IOAPIC, there is
lapic_suspend()/lapic_resume() and ioapic_suspend()/ioapic_resume(),
which will be called before/after kexec jump through
device_power_down()/device_power_up(). So, the mechanism for
LAPIC/IOAPIC is there, we may need to check the corresponding
implementation.
