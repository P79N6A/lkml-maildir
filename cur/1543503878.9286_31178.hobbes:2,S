Well, you're right there, off course. I didn't really have THAT extreme
forms of dedicated systems in mind. However, to be very picky here, the
word "padded" breaks your argument. Take another look at this...

You're right about the rest, as jitter is not at all a problem in a
padded loop running on a DSP that's synchronized to the sample clock.
But as soon as you need some conditional code, you're in it deep.
Anyway, we're off topic here again... We can't tune Linux to THAT level,
after all! ;-)
