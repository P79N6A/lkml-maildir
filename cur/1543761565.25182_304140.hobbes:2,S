This is way overkill I think.
Take a look at set_pte_at().  You get the "mm", the
virtual address, the pte pointer, and the new pte value.
What else could you possibly need to track stuff like this
and react appropriately? :-)
It is even an argument for batched TLB processing on ia64.
It simplifies a lot of cache flushing issues and you can
control the flushing on a per-translation basis however
you like.
