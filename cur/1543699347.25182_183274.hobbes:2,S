ds is set up already to point at the empty_zero_page, else none of
what I'm doing is correct.  But, it is very likely that something else
is using 0x228 in empty_zero_page but isn't marked as using it in
Documentation/i386/zero-page.txt.
You've been patient, and thorough.  As another test, could you change
include/asm-i386/edd.h: DISK80_SIG_BUFFER from 0x228 to 0x2cc (the
four bytes immediately before the e820 memory buffer), and see if that
helps?  If so, I'll submit a patch to use that instead, and another
that markes 0x228 as in use by something else.

I'm quite certain that ds is correct, but that 0x228 may be in use by
something else.

OK, I'll look into that too.

Ahh, yes.  I read that now.  OK, no harm in doing so, I'll add that.

So, I thought about this for a while when I first wrote the code.  I
haven't run across *any* BIOSses yet which didn't implement function
48 for at least some version of EDD; it may not be version 0x30, but we've got
space reserved for it up to the size 0x30 could return, so it doesn't
matter.  If it returns anything in function 41, then it will return
something in function 48 too.  I could be wrong I suppose, but none of
the BIOS reports I've seen suggest otherwise.
Thanks,
Matt
