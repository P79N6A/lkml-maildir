If that person cannot reproduce the problem but another skilled kernel
developer can then it would make sense for he-who-can-reproduce-it to do
some work.
Still, I doubt if that's the case here.
Is the below correct?
Old behaviour:
	a) press alt
	b) press sysrq
	c) release alt
	d) press T
	e) release T
	f) release sysrq
New behaviour:
	a) press alt
	b) press sysrq
	c) release sysrq
	d) press T
	e) release T
	f) release alt
If so, then the old behaviour was weird and the new behaviour is sensible. 
What, actually, is the problem?
