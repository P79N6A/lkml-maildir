This patch is wrong, it also forbids `rmdir ../foo'.  Only a path ending
in '.' is special.  Think about it: to find out the real name of the entry
to unlink you'll have find its link in the parent directory.  With `.' you
simply don't have enough information about what to unlink.

That doesn't make sense at all.  The current process's pwd is in no way
special.
