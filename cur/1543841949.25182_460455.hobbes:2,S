Quite possibly.  But where this approach falls down in not in the basics
but in the data structures.  And it isn't that hard to fix the data
structures.  Just something I don't want to do the first pass.

Maybe.  The best name I can think of is:
find_greater_or_equal_pid(int nr) and that is a little 
clumsy.   On the other hand it isn't confusing what the function
does.
Any other suggestions?
