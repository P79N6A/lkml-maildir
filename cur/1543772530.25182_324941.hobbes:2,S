well, "mode 3" is PREEMPT_DESKTOP - normal CONFIG_PREEMPT on the 
mainstream kernel. If you turn on hardirq/softirq threading then you can 
e.g. chprio your sound IRQ to have better audio latencies. It will cause 
runtime overhead though. On "mode 4" (PREEMPT_RT) hardirq/softirq 
threading is mandatory (due to the processing model).
