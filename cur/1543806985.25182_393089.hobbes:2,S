PID virtualization has nothing to do with containers and its structure. 
This VPID patch can be used both in environments with hierarchical and 
flat structure.
I mean that this VPID patch introduces some kind of abstraction, which 
means that global unique pid is not always what user sees. Thats it.
And kernel should not be modified in all places where access checks 
current->pid == allowed_pid are done. Global unique PIDs are preserved.

Can't catch what you mean. What kind of administration do you want for 
VPIDs? Do you have one for usual PIDs? It is assigned by kernel and 
that's it.

it has. see proc patch.

How is it related to inter context signalling???
virtualization of signaling is a separate task and has nothing to do 
with pids.

1. if kernel has some errors, these errors should be fixed. 
Virtualization doesn't deal with it, doesn't solve such issues, doesn't 
make it worse. So what do you mean?
2. if kernel has some issues and error cases can you point them to me? I 
will be glad to fix it. Without pointing to the facts your words sound 
like a pure speculation. What issues? What error cases? Where task 
groups and sessiona aren't handled properly?

OpenVZ successfully works with >1000 VPSs on a single server.
What scenarios do you mean?
I see no arguments from your side except for some guesses.

I'm not against pid handling cleanups, am I?
This can be done in parallel/before/after.
