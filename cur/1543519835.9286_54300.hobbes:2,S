BTW 32bit uids are important for more than big organizations. I'm
playing with idea to "split" user into few uids so that netscape I
run could not read my .ssh/identity. It would be nice to have 32bit
uids in 2.4...

PS: Imagine uid split into 24:8 bits, when X:0 is user than can do
anything X:1-255 uid's can do. X:1 can not kill processes by "user"
X:2. And now, every user gets X:0 initially, and can decide to run
subprocesses under X:... uid's.
