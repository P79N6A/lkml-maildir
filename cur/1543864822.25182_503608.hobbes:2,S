	In the ACPI submenu there are following options:
ACPI version features (1.0, 2.0, 3.0 - I have set it to 3.0, but I think
	I have tried 2.0 as well)
ACPI APIC support (I have Enabled)
ACPI SRAT table (Enabled)
ACPI OEMB table (Enabled)
Headless mode (Disabled)
Then there is a MPS option in a different submenu (I have 1.4, but I have
	tried 1.1 as well).
Another APIC related function is in the southbridge setup:
Hide XIOAPIC PCI function (I think I have it disabled[*])

	Yes, of course.

	Done, 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7908
BTW, when trying to attach the dmesg output to the bugzilla entry, I've
got the following message:

	I think the dead.letter message should not be there :-)
Apparently, this bugzilla does not have a "bugzilla" category.
Where can I report this?
: Any chance you can see if Windows finds multiple processors on this board with this version of the BIOS?
: 
	I can try this in two weeks or so.
: ps. after you get the acpidump for the failing system, check for a BIOS update.
	In the pervious mail I wrote:

	So AFAIK there is no BIOS update available.
