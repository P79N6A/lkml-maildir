That will probably break with CONFIG_MODVERSIONS.  At the very least it
will require make mrproper when changing CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ALI15X3 and
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS is set to y.
Modversions does its own #define of nthe function name.  Anybody
contemplating a mixture of real functions and #define of the function
name must test their patch with CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=y, otherwise you are
setting users up for wierd bug reports.
