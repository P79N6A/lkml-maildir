Hi,
I got a big problem with 2.2.x kernels.
I don't know hot to set i biger limit for max open files.
In  2.0.x it was /proc/sys/kernel/file-max,
kernel 2.2.x doesn't have this file and say me "To many open files in the
system", I got a big system where the standart limit is to small.
I don't know where set inodes max limit too.
The file /proc/sys/kernel/inode-max gone too.
How can I set these limit in 2.2.x kernels ?
Greets,
