I think the complete list of functions to be hooked needs to be at least:
mmap(MAP_FIXED), munmap, sbrk(-n), shmat, shdt.  The mapping cases
are needed because a mmap(MAP_FIXED) can implicitly unmap an area under
them, before the new address is used.
This is not a kernel issue as this is purely a user space problem,
the kernel provides all of the necessary functionality.
I suspect what is needed is something like:
int on_unmap(void (*func)(void *start, size_t length, void *), void *arg);
With the function called before the unmap actually occurs, that way
the multi thread case is safe.  It needs to be built so that multiple libraries
can cooperate cleanly.
Ulrich what do you think.  Is the above function reasonable?
Something like it is needed to manage caches of pinned memory for high
performance kernel bypass libraries.
