1.) you can't call down() at interrupt time, as it is basically going to
put the caller to sleep/schedule() if the count goes below 0.  Sleeping at
interrupt-time is not allowed.  You're almost certainly using this at
interrupt-time context, right?  I'm not certain exactly what kind of
locking you need, but investigate spinlocks:
linux/Documentation/spinlocks.txt
2.) 2.2.5-15smp is not a kernel version, but a particular packaging of a
particular kernel version by a particular vendor.  You should really be
downloading and working with the latest kernels "by-hand" if you're going
to do development.  This way you won't be chasing bugs that have already
been fixed, and you won't be relying on faith in someone elses idea of a
valid kernel configuration.
