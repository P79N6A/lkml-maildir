him on this stuff ?

We're actually using numa emulation to do real (container) things with.
However, 128MB is still pretty small for that ... and worst case, we
just waste 1MB for a 64MB node, right? Which isn't beautiful, but
doesn't seem like the end of the world for an obscure corner case.

There's also the possibility it just doesn't make enough difference
to affect a real benchmark ...
