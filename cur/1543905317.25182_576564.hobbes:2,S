Subject: [PATCH] mips: qemu network work again
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

After kernel 2.6.21, the qemu of mips with nfsroot is not working.
There are too much WATCHDOG timeout.
I try to find what makes it not working and I found it.
After Ingo Monlar's patch "[PATCH] genirq: do not mask interrupts by default" [1], it's not working.
To solve this, we also have to register the IRQ disable field in MIPS, as x86 does.
