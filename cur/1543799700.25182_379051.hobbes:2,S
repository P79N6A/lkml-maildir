Hi everybody,
My machine locked up on me and I found this message on my serial
console.  I have no idea how to decode its meaning - can you help?
CPU 0: Machine Check Exception:                4

Kernel panic - not syncing: Machine check
My machine is a dual Opteron running the 2.6.13.3 kernel.  I'm not
positive, but I think I can reproduce it.  Assuming that I can, what
information would be helpful to debug the problem?
Please cc: me on the response as I am not subscribed to this mailing list.
Thanks!
Andy
