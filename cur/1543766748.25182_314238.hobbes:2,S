I can accept that netlink is unreliable protocol and can drop messages
- but that should only happen when there is memory pressure. In your
case you simply can not send messages with frequency higher than your
timeslice unless you implement synchronous protocol.
Load balancing allows bursts as long as average rate is under control
- connector does not.
