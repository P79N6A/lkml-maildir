ok,
  /dev/sda, etc is nice and handy, but in the event of a disk not 
spinning up right, you can really get hosed.  If you loose a disk
that's needed and it mounts another in it's place (since names are
asigned to the device each boot) it can really trash some important
files.
How hard/bad would it be to make SUN style naming such as
/dev/c0t1d0s0 and such work for /etc/fstab, lilo and such?  This could
make life easier and also safer.  If you loose a scratch disk, it might
not mount your backup disk over it and have a cron-job clean your 
backup files out for scratch space...
