Yesterday, while working on a machine I was pinging through a ppp interface
to another machine (maybe 4 hops away). I noticed that on several of the
packets I got errors saying that byte 97 was expected to be 97 and was
instead 98. Or something like that. Unfortunately, I did not connect the
message with this thread at the time.
This machine was just going through a 16550A UART to an external modem. I
will try to reproduce this today and record the exact error message.

My problem appears to be solved (so far). I removed my Megahertz
EM1144-T PCMCIA Ethernet/modem card and inserted a D-Link DFE-650 Fast
Ethernet PC Card, and the problem seems to go away.
I imagine it has something to do with the serial_cs driver. I'm using
version 3.0.12 of PCMCIA Card Services.
