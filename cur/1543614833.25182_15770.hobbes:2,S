Personally I'd like to see each C file have a header like
this too, describing in a few lines what the functions in
this file are supposed to do.
This should make it easier for people to figure out not just
what each C file is about, but also if they should spend their
time wading through this particular C file when in search of
some piece of code.

Rik
