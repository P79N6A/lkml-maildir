If PI wasn't a concern for mainline, why is PI futexes merged into the 
mainline?
I notice that the rwsems used now isn't priority inversion safe (thus 
destroyingthe perpose of having PI futexes). We thus already have a bug in 
the mainline.
I suggest making a rw_mutex which does read side PI: A reader boosts the 
writer, but a writer can't boost the readers, since there can be a large 
amount of those.
I don't have time to make such a rw_mutex but I have a simple idea for 
one, where the rt_mutex can be reused.
  struct pi_rw_mutex {
       int count; /*  0   -> unoccupied,
                      >0 -> the number of current readers,
                            Second highest bit: there are a waiting writer
                      -1 -> A writer have it. */
       struct rt_mutex mutex;
  }
Use atomic exchange on count.
When locking:
A writer checks if count <= 0. If so it sets the value to -1 and takes
the mutex. When it gets the mutex it rechecks the count and proceeds.
If count > 0 the writer sets the second highest bit and add itself to
the wait-list in the mutex and sleeps. (The mutex will now be in a state 
where owner==NULL but there are waiters. It must be cheched if the 
rt_mutex code can handle this.)
A reader checks if count >= 0. If so it does count++ and proceeds.
If count < 0 it takes the rtmutex. When it gets the mutex it sets the 
count to 1, unlocks the mutex and proceeds.
When unlocking:
The writer sets count to 0 or 0x8000000 (second highest bit) depending 
on how many waiters the mutex have and unlocks the mutex.
The reader checks if count is 0x80000001. If so it sets count to 0 and 
wakes up the first waiter on the mutex (if there are any). Otherwise it 
just do count--.
