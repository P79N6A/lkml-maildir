Yes, I was generalizing in speach-mode to bias my words (it's been a fast
reply), and my only object was to comment on the per-task information that
become meaningless with async write I/O (that's the common case).

You are completly correct, also rawio, mount -o sync, `/bin/sync` etc..
all cause write requests to be queued into the elevator from the task
context.
Thanks for pointing this out and sorry if I am been confusing.
