Hi,
   Still recently I was using 2.4 version of the kernel. Now after
moving to 2.6 I am finding difficult to load modules specific to 2.6, Is
there any changes which I need to do in the startup scripts. If yes,
where??? I am using Libranet( Debian ) I did some tweak in
/etc/init.d/modutils like renaming the VERSION to 2.6 etc..., but
nothing helpful happened. 
Suggest what can be done....
Thanks
Mohideen
