Hi,
Here is the log snipet when plug the pendrive in, i thin It should be
clear from this that is uses ehci_hcd, ub, hotplug and udev. For 1.1 it
uses uhci_hcd

The problem is reproducable with 2.6.9. Unfortunately I have no time
right now to check 2.6.8.1 if the problem already presists there.
It seems however that the 1.1 device recovers if I wait long enough, but
I left the 2.0 device here all night and it did not. To make it worse,
it seems that the whole USB 2.0 system went down, there was no activity
even if i reconnected the pen, had to reboot to be detected and powered
on again (normal reboot was not an option again, so I had to use
alt-sysrq-B).
Hope this helps to track down this problem.
