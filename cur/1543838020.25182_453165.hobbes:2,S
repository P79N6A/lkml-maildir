I wasn't even aware that this change had been made.  I don't recall (and I
cannot locate) any mailing list discussion of it.
Maybe I missed the discussion.  But if not, this is yet another case of
significant changes getting into mainline via a git merge and sneaking
under everyone's radar.
It seems like a bad idea to me.  Any additional latency at all in disk
completion adds directly onto process waiting time - we do a _lot_ of
synchronous disk IO.
There is no mention in the changelog of any observed problems which this
patch solves.  Can we revert it please?
