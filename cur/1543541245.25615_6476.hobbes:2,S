Hmm, not so nifty.  test6 completely breaks pcmcia with either package.  The
kernel pcmcia modules load and all is configured but no packets are passed and
netdev timeouts and status errors as well as a supposed lack of eeprom.  the
top socket still hangs the machine.
dhinds Aug.7 package compiles more cleanly than .19 but fails to load, attached
are snippets from this.
