Shouldn't those four 'if' statements use unlikely()?  There's no sense
causing more slowdown than necessary, even in debug code.
And I'd change the messages slightly, e.g.:
        "list_add: corruption: next->prev should be %p, was %p\n"
Some people build (accidentally?) without verbose debug info and
don't get line numbers.
