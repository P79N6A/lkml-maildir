Does anyone know the status to 8x agp support under linux?
I am using the Granite bay 7205 chipset and I cant get my geforce4 card
to use agpgart or nvidia's agp support, it seems to be defaulting to pci
mode (not even using 4x agp).
I do a:
cat /proc/driver/nvidia/agp/status
which is my indication that i am not using agp bus to its fullest.
