Jesse,
This looks overall pretty good. Just a few nits.

This is a great example and should be used instead of the qla1280 code
snippet that you used. Please just point at the source file that contains
the code and name the register usage this example represents.
Ie make it easy to find the example in real code without using
line numbers.

Yes - I think this is alot clearer than the previous documents - thanks!

This is the example code I'd like to see replaced with your
synthetic example above.
