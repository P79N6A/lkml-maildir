It _does_ do that.  When I do a pull, it shows me what got pulled, and if 
I don't like it, I can just undo it.
But that's not the point.
I want to know what I'm pulling _ahead_ of time, AND I WANT TO KNOW THAT 
WHAT I PULL IS WHAT THE SENDER INTENDED ME TO PULL!
No amount of "git tells me what I pulled" will ever give me either.
If the pushing side cannot be bothered to tell me what the repository 
contains, I really don't want to have anything to do with that repository 
or its maintainer. I want people to tell me what they are sending me, 
because that way both they and I are aware of what to expect.
In other words, this is not about technology. This is about human 
interaction. I do _not_ trust git repositories. I trust the people who 
make those git repositories available, and that means that I want to hear 
from them.
I want them to tell me what they are sending, so that _when_ I pull, I can 
line up the result of that pull with the mail they sent, and I can tell 
"ok, that's actually what the other side intended".
