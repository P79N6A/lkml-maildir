Told you, it was ugly and I noted in the comments too :)
BTW, I don't think that is the correct solution. I guess,
we need to do the IO beyond EOF and zero out the data.
And also, this can happen only if the EOF is in the middle
of the block - so its an issue only for the last block.
What do you think ?
Thanks,
