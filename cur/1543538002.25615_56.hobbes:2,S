thanks, keith,
i did get a console set up and what i found surprised me.
as a recap, i'm running a dual p3 600 machine (test2 smp kernel), with
512M ram, asus p2b-d mobo, and matrox g400 max video card.
when x locked up this time, i checked to make sure it was just as dead
as before... no keyboard response whatsoever (no capslock, no numlock,
no alt-sysreq) and no mouse movement.  from another virtual console on
my console box, i tried pinging my locked up box.  all pings died.  i
couldn't ssh to it, _but_ i was able to log in from console and that
seemed to work just fine.  killing all x-related processes didn't
release my keyboard and monitor though.  i eventually had to reboot from
console.
this leads me to believe that:
a. sometime after 2.3.99-pre6 was released, my video card had a minor
stroke.
-or-
b. something in pre7 and above is triggering some bug in either x or the
g400 that causes the g400 to completely wedge.  
could there be another possibility?  does anyone have any ideas about
how i might be able to figure out which is true?
is there a software utility for resetting a g400?
thanks,
pete
