Yes, and that should change. The tty drivers for instance attach private
data to struct file, so that they don't need to keep track of stuff based
on minor number, making them potentially much more dynamic. The memory
devices effectively do the same by passing off a special fops array after
open. An improved device lookup would work off of major, minor, and type
as key, rather than simply major (and type at a higher level).
