Subject: [PATCH] PPC64 Make UP kernel run on POWER4 logical partition
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Recently I tried booting a UP kernel on a 1-processor logical
partition on a POWER4 system.  It failed because the CPU we happened
to be running on was CPU 2, but hard_smp_processor_id() is defined to
0 for !CONFIG_SMP.  (Note that this code runs quite early, as part of
init_IRQ, so hard_smp_processor_id() should be the physical ID of the
boot cpu.)
This patch does a minimal fix to make it work.  I think this patch
should go in 2.6.10.  Ultimately I think the hard_smp_processor_id()
definition should be removed from include/linux/smp.h, but that
carries a risk of breaking other architectures and probably shouldn't
be done pre 2.6.10.
