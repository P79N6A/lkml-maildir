yes, inode dump shows that i_fop = &bad_file_ops, and IMHO it's possible only
for bad inode.

This incident has been occurred on Virtuozzo kernel based on latest RHEL4
2.6.9-55.el5, and it have your patch applied. btw thank you very much for this fix.
Unfortunately I do not know how this inode become bad, but inode dump in
ext3_destroy_inode shows that it is.
As far as I understand ext3_read_inode has been noticed that raw inode has
i_links_count=0 and therefore inode was marked as bad. However I have no any
ideas is it possible to have an inode on disk with i_links_count=0.
Thank you,
