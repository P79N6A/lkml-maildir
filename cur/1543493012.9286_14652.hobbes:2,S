Sure, if you have CAP_SETFCAP, you should be able to remove both in a
whack.  Likewise, if you have write access to the file, writing should
clear both.  Since the kernel currently has _no_ policy for the sticky
bit, I think implementing these shouldn't be a problem.

The immutable bit was introduced to prevent the 'old kernel' problem;
i.e., so that users on the same box couldn't cap-enable their binaries.
Mounting a remote fs and honoring heightened capabilities from it is a
security risk in any event; I suggest 'cap_squash' be the default, much as
'root_squash' is now.

If you can trust the sticky bit remotely, do so; if not, don't.  I have no
problem with this, but this is apparently just a genuine disagreement
between us, which is fine.

OK, but why are you mounting an fs w/ Linux-elf executables and honoring
raised priviledges from an IRIX server?  Now, with either scheme you could
have a mount option that honors the file inheritable set only.  Not
terribly secure in either event, but maybe worth more thought.

Not everybody has done their homework on this stuff before speaking up.  I
now see that you obviously have done the required reading.

If the game is meant to be run by normal users, then you don't want a
normal users' bash process to have CAP_SYS_RESOURCE in it's inheritable
set; then _any_ process can inherit it.  Rather, you want it in the
permitted set.  This means that your game developers will need the ability
to mark a file 'setuid root' anyway, so they can set whatever they want in
_either_ scheme.
Now, I have a suggestion that should apply equally to either solution; it
could be possible to specify in a mount option masks for permitted and
inheritable.  This would limit the actual capabilites the mount would
honor.  This could be nice for either implementation.

OK, I haven't really completely understood the whole nfs problem untill
now.  My bad.  You last sentence made it clear to me.  Worse, it could be
ugly to code the correct mount options into the _client_.  Best I can do
now is cop-out and say that caps in fs metadata won't work over nfs in any
case.  I _still_ want a correct implementation of capabilities to use.

You're right here.  But this is still just a disagreement; I don't want to
mix old setuid-root is special with new capability-based security.  You
do.

Ah, you're referring to real, saved, effective and fs uid, I guess.  I
don't see any good reason to screw with the old semantics.

I also suggest that sticky/immutable semantics clear both on write, when
write would otherwise be permitted by the fs rights.  Again, I'm just
giving the kernel a reasonable interpretation of a bit that it previously
didn't care about.

Well, you've just gone and completely thrown away the old semantics for
the operation of the setuid bit if the file is marked setuid-root.  The
sticky bit solution merely preserves the old semantics completely, except
setuid-root no longer grants all caps.  It just gives the process root's
rights in the fs, which currently would be a bad thing. (I wouldn't
suggest making capability-enabled binaries setuid-root under the sticky
bit scheme/)

I _strongly_ disagree here.  I don't like breaking old semantics when
unnecessary.  root=god -> capabilities is a well-defined transition in
semantics, I don't think would should break other stuff.

File.

Right, but so far (according to my threads with Richard Gooch and Pavel
Machek) any file that isn't setuid-root will still have it's inheritable
bits honored.  This would mean any file could inherit rights from the
admin.  With the sticky bit solution, a paranoid admin (or distribution
maintainer) could configure the kernel to use default inheritable of 0,
and only honor inheritable on a file that has been capability enabled.
(which in this system is a priviledged operation).  Yes, the distribution
maintainer would have to set caps for _every_ file with a legitimate right
to inherit caps, but I think it would be great to be able to do that.  An
admin would be virtually immune from trojan binaries on the local fs.
('sl -Fla' anyone? ;-)

Well, yes, you can mark cp, tar, etc... as setuid-root, and that would
work just fine to securely set inheritable bits.  But this is a
compatibility nightmare; don't _EVER_ boot to an old kernel.  Eric
Biederman suggested the immutable bit specifically to make it safe to boot
to an older kernel.  You also don't want all these extra setuid-root
binaries on a remote-mount fs.

I don't understand 'can't safely remove bits from pI.'...

I honestly don't know why it was rejected.  I can only say that,
implementing with sticky/immutable makes it look very good to me.  And the
support is mostly in the kernel already.
It seems we have some genuine disagreements, but at least I feel our
latest exchange has been productive.  I'm sorry I was a bit rude in my
last message.
In any event, I think it's time others took the time to understand the
issues involved and weigh in with other educated opinions.
cheers,
