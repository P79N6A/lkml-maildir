Thanks.  I'll download Intel's latest driver and test it.   I wasn't 
discussing the out of tree driver (why do you have a broken Linux out of 
tree driver, BTW?   If its for Linux, shouldn't it be updated here 
first) but the driver in 2.6.20.4 (which is missing support four 
additional chipsets).
