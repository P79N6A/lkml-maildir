OK the patch looks fine. Taken. Still I have some notes:
1. Let's start calling stuff ATA and not IDE. (AT-Attachment is it
and not just Integrated Device Electornics.) OK?
2. I quite don't like the nested #include directives in ide-timing.h.
    It's cleaner to include the needed headers in front of usage
    of ide-timing.h. (Just s small note.... not really important...)
3. I wellcome that the MIN MAX macros there are gone. In fact
I have yerstoday just done basically the same ;-). (Will just have to
revert it now.
Patch swallowed.
