I do not see either of these symptoms, and nobody else has reported

# make -f $KBUILD_SRCTREE_000/Makefile-2.5 xconfig
Using ARCH='i386' AS='as' LD='ld' CC='/usr/bin/gcc' CPP='/usr/bin/gcc -E' AR='ar' HOSTAS='as' HOSTLD='gcc' HOSTCC='gcc' HOSTAR='ar'

xconfig menu displays, clicking save and exit ends xconfig and drops
back to the command prompt, it does not do anything else.
