The latest maintenance release GIT 1.1.4 is available at the
usual places:
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/
	git-1.1.4.tar.{gz,bz2}			(tarball)
	RPMS/$arch/git-*-1.1.4-1.$arch.rpm	(RPM)
This contains one minor fix and one performance fix.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since v1.1.3 are as follows:
Johannes Schindelin:
      git-fetch-pack: really do not ask for funny refs
      * This fixes a case where "git-fetch-pack" is asked to
        fetch all the refs; git barebone Porcelain never
        triggers it and that is one reason why it was never
        noticed so far.
Junio C Hamano:
      Revert "check_packed_git_idx(): check integrity of the idx file itself."
      * This was causing significant performance degradation
        compared to 0.99.9x.  First noticed and complained by
        Andrew, and the bisect tool by Linus helped to pinpoint
        it.  I just took credit for what the two kernel titans
        did to help us ;-).
