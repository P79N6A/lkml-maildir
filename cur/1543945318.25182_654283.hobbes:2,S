That's good to know.  Do you have a link or anything to their

Ugh.. sadly that's what's coming.  I really don't get why the
northbridge cannot burst however.  If the memory is mapped
prefetchable and you have to do a PCI read through 3 PCIe bridges to
finally get to your device it seems like it would _really_ behoove the
bridge to do a Memory read multiple and get the whole cache line.  I
have searched around a lot and there doesn't seem to be any info at
all on how you can persuade these bridges to do different PCI commands
or burst.  I don't know why....
thanks again for your help,
