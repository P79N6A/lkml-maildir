Agreed.  Assuming mknod(1) is dev_t-clean, this is obsolete as soon as
glibc is updated for 64-bit dev_t.  Until then, this is available and
easy and works.

mknod(1) does not, I think.  Actually, maybe it does... it uses some
coreutils wrapper.
But my mknod64(1) certainly does :)
Hex, decimal, and binary should all work.
