Chris,
Make is not my forte, but here is a working test to see if apparmor
exists in Ubuntu 8.04.
Maybe have make apply a patch to the btrfs source if this test
succeeds? Does this work in SUSE?
http://www.digitalprognosis.com/opensource/patches/btrfs/lame_apparmor_test_for_btrfs.patch
The symlink from /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build ->
/path/to/kernel/headers/ doesn't exist on CentOS 5.
Even though it is a hack, is this or something like it usable? Or is
this the completely wrong direction?
