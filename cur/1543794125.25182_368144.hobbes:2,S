Subject: [PATCH 3/4] SwapMig: Drop unused pages immediately
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Drop unused pages immediately
If a page is encountered that is only referenced by the migration code
then there is no reason to swap or migrate the page. Release
the page by calling move_to_lru().
