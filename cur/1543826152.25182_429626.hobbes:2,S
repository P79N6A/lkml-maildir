You're kidding, right?  I've never been able to get X to get the  
modes right on my damn flatpanel.  Hell, it can't even match DDC  
channels to VGA ports without hand-holding in the config file.  To  
contrast, the fbdev layer gets it right every time on the whole  
variety of hardware that I've got.  Likewise the only way that I've  
ever gotten X to even set a vaguely functional mode on another card  
is by loading the framebuffer module first and specifying Option  
"UseFBDev" "true".  Anything else and the monitor goes off mode and  
there's no getting it back.

I kind of agree, but on the other hand there needs to be a way to  
specify multiple viewports in a single framebuffer like MergedFB on  
my radeon.  I would be quite happy to tinker with my little C-based  
framebuffer graphics apps in the console except that I can't  
manipulate the second display's view in the same framebuffer with fbset.

IMHO the best way to do this is leave basic 7-bit or 8-bit fonts in  
the kernel where they are now and do the rest from a little userspace  
framebuffer console.  With a secure-attention-key to revert to the  
native console for emergency debugging and such, set up so it can  
display panics, I think the rest would be much better handled with  
the flexibility and locale support of userspace.

IMHO X is currently broken enough on much of my hardware that I'd be  
completely happy to be forced to upgrade.  My LCD has diagonal red  
scrolling when in X (works fine on the kernel console though) and X  
can't seem to hardware accelerate at all, even on this RV200 chip.

I'd personally rather not see any IOCTLs for poking of ports, I kinda  
like being able to script framebuffer drawing with a little bit of  
Perl or some hastily written C.  Calling FBIOGET_VSCREENINFO is fine,  
calling FBIO_POKE_OBSCURE_PORT is kinda iffy.  I realize there's no  
black and white but it would be nice to maintain some clarity of  
interface; make simple things simple and hard things possible.
