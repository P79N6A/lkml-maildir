Here this is the bulk of messages on my server (which is otherwise
fairly quiet).
It really doesn't matter whether the message is technically accurate -
it's mostly there for the benefit of kernel hackers. The average end
user is not going to have the slightest clue what is going on nor should
they even care. An advanced network admin might be able to figure things
out by poking at packet traces, but again: not much reason to care. For
most admins, the vast majority of these treasonous peers won't be under
their administrative control. 
If you want, we can instead say "Peer %d unexpectedly shrunk window...".
So long as the scary bit is gone, I don't care.
