That is precisely the reason why I am concerned.  If it was only during 
system-wide resume, the impact of the very-long mdelay() would be more 
difficult to notice.
You also ignored my question :)
If the PCI layer is calling the resume method for a PCI device while 
simultaneously calling the suspend method, that's a PCI layer problem. 
Similarly, If the USB layer is calling into your driver while you are 
resuming, something is broken and it ain't your locking.
