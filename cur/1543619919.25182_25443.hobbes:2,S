Locally generated packets seem to go through the tests in the output table 
first, then on to postrouting.  I didn't think the type of the locally 
generated packet mattered.  (I know UDP, TCP, or ICMP don't...)

Sounds about right.

If you asked for a raw socket, the system won't append an IP header to it for 
you.  You asked it not to.
It has to come before the routing decision.  Otherwise how does it know where 
to send it?  (You might have more than one network interface in the machine.  
Two ethernet cards, or ethernet and ppp...)

Have you tried the "logging" target?  It's loads of fun for this sort of 
thing...
