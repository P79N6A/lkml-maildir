Why do we need it ? We can use some simple convention: "\my_document" is not
directory but albod "my_document" while "my_document" is just plain directory.
There are still exists some minor possibility of clash so additional check
should be added (for .albod subdirectory in directory with name started with
"\") but in 99.999% cases you'll not need additional directory access.
BTW about directories: why I cann't add cool icon to directory ? May be we
need some way to have directory-with-metadata ? "*my_folder" perhaps ?

We REALLY need BOTH 100% user level implementation (first) and mixed mode
implementation (where time-critical operations are pulled in kernel).
Without 100% user-level portable implementation multifork documents will not
be adopted by GNOME/KDE and without application all cool stuff in kernel is
useless. On other hand I'm pretty sure that once we'll have user-level
implementation in place we'll find enough reasons to pull some parts in
kernel for speed.

Yes. It's great acronym. But where this discussion must continue ? It does
not belond to linux-kernel anymore but where it belonds to ? There are quite
a few things must be resolved (who and when will reassemble blob received via
http/ftp/whatever? do we need something like ncd?)...
