 It seems lately there has been a surge of interest in getting
 niche x86 clones included in mainline (Voyager, numaq, Elan, etc).
 I forget who it was who suggested it, but the idea came up of
 using a similar approach to arm's subarchitecture support for x86.
 The downsides would probably be a lot of code duplication,
 The upside would be hiding away specialised code from the 99% of
 people who don't need to see it.  The Voyager patch for example
 was ~150kb iirc, and was imo still quite intrusive even after
 a first round of suggestions. Putting it into arch/x86-32/voyager/
 would allow those that do care about it to do whatever they deem
 necessary without inflicting dozens of #ifdefs and the likes
 on the majority.
