I am pleased to announce the availability of 
   mdadm version 1.1.0
It is available at
   
http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~neilb/source/mdadm/
and
http://www
.{countrycode}.kernel.org/pub/utils/raid/mdadm/
as a source tar-ball and (at the first site) as an SRPM, and as an RPM for i386.
mdadm is a tool for creating, managing and monitoring
device arrays using the "md" driver in Linux, also
known as Software RAID arrays.
Release 1.1.0 contains a number of spell corrections, and bug fixes.
It has improved support for MULTIPATH arrays.
It has some new features including:
  --daemonise   	for use with --monitor
  --config=partitions   to find devices by examining /proc/partitions
  --update=super-minor  to change the recorded minor-number for an array
Much of the improvements are due to user feed-back.  Thanks are due to all who 
gave suggestions and reported problems.
I expect the next major release to be 2.0.0 which will include support for 
a new super-block format soon to be supported by 2.5 series kernels.
Development of mdadm is sponsored by CSE@UNSW: 
  The School of Computer Science and Engineering
at
  The University of New South Wales
