It is possible to have a non-standard code segment in the GDT, too.
Thus a better to check is "unlikely((regs->xcs & 0xffff) != __USER_CS)".
One way to add in the correct base would be to use the real segment
register.  Don't call __get_user: call your own special function which
uses %gs, and temporarily load regs->xcs into %gs.
Alternatively you can just calculate the base and add it.
