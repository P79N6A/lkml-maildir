Well, bummer.  I can't seem to find Eric's message archived anywhere.
FWIW I am opposed to any large-scale cleanup of the configuration
language and/or identifiers in -any- 2.4.x series kernel.
Not only C code but installer utilities are affected by changes in the
CONFIG_xxx identifiers.  If we change that namespace, we are changing
part of the API that is exported to drivers.  Definitely not 2.4.x
stuff.
If we are moving to CML2 in 2.5, I see no point in big CML1 cleanups.
