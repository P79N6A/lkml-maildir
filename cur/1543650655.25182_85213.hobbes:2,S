I'm implementing a cache for a database file system. Using mmap I
would like to know how mmap works.
For instance if my file is open in read/write and I'm mapping in
read/write but I use only the block in write, is the kernel going to
read on the disk?
Here is a sample code:
int h = open(file, O_RDWR | O_SYNC);
void * memory =
  mmap(0, pageSize, PROT_WRITE | PROT_READ, MAP_SHARED, handle, 0);
I'm actually using the same code to get read or write block, so if I'm
using the block in write only I would like to know if this code is
correct or if I'd better change the flags according to writing or
reading access.
Sincerely,
Sebastien Morand.
