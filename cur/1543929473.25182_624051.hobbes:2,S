I was wishing that the bidi work can go into 2.6.25, I guess that's 
James to say. If so than it is not important what order they go in.
Or the patchset can be submitted in two parts, with scsi and remove-of-
old-API in a later stage. 
Or *rant* Boaz can just rebase his work again *rant*.
Kiyoshi, It's OK, if you have a maintainer that is willing to
accept your work then go head, My code can wait, no problem.
Just resolve the resid issue in scsi_io_completion()
(See my other mail)
Thanks for doing this
Boaz
