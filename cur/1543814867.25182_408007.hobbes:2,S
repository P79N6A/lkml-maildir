It gets converted to MAX_SEC_IN_JIFFIES, which depends on HZ, but is
definitely <= 0x7fffffff. For HZ = 1000 its 2147483 seconds (~24days), for
HZ = 250 its *4 .....

Note that this is different to alarm().
alarm(unsigned int seconds);
vs.
setitimer(struct timeval *value, struct timeval *oldvalue);
So you have to willingly set value->it_value.tv_sec to a negative value or
let it randomly uninitialized.

Yeah, I would have limited it to 10 warnings, but I can also do only one.
I make up a patch tomorrow morning.
