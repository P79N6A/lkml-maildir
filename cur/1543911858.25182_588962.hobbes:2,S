kvm_flush_remote_tlbs() is something that can be generalized.  
Basically, you set a bit in each vcpu and send an IPI to take them out.
But that's deadlock prone and complex.  Maybe you can just take 
kvm->lock, zap the mmu and the flush tlbs, and patch the instruction at 
your leisure, as no vcpu will be able to map memory until the lock is 
released.

Any sufficiently difficult bug is indistinguishable from a feature.
