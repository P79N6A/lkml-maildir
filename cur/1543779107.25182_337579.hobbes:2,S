Only these seem not referenced by source:
PCI_CLASS_SYSTEM_PCI_HOTPLUG
PCI_DEVICE_ID_CYRIX_PCI_MASTER
PCI_DEVICE_ID_HP_PCI_LBA
PCI_DEVICE_ID_NP_PCI_FDDI
PCI_DEVICE_ID_UPCI_RM3_4PORT
PCI_DEVICE_ID_UPCI_RM3_8PORT
Source macros refer to:
  BROOKTREE	sound/pci/bt87x.c
  YAMAHA	sound/oss/ymfpci.c
6 from 2329 entries hardly worth it?
Grant.
