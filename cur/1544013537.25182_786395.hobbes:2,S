Yes, but in this case I'm the one passing in the data so I know there aren't 
multiple blanks.  (Or tabs instead of spaces.)
In a private email, Bernd Petrovitsch suggested "set -- $i" and then using 
NAME=$1; PERIOD=$2.  (I keep getting private email responses to these sort of 
threads, and then getting dismissed as the only one who cares about the issue.  
Less so this time around, but still...)  This apparently works all the way 
back to the bourne shell.  Not worth rolling another patch for, but if I do 
wind up rolling another patch for other reasons I might switch over to that.  
Both "cut" and "awk" are susv3, though.
