In many cases, it makes sense to _read_ the error message before commenting it.
The message is _not_ related to OPC!

You can do up to 99 OPC calls to a single media.

The person who made the statement on the line above seems to lack any
basic knowlede....
Obviously a buffer underrun.
Possible reasons: 
-	Bad configuration (IDE cabling)
	- in this case it may help to read README.ATAPI
-	Bad configuration (SCSI setup)
	- In this case check cabling/termination and make sure
		all devices to disconnect/reconnect.
-	A kernel bug.
	- Ask for help from the Kernel crew.
