I'm using the 2.4.9-ac9 preempt patch to test things out.  Everything is fine 
and stable except it seems that sudden and rapid network accesses cause tiny 
"pops" in the soundcard that didn't occur before the patch.  This is not 
increased system load or anything so the audio isn't skipping due to that. 
It has only happened so far when grabbing many tiny files in rapid succession 
(note. only at 70K/s).  Weird.
