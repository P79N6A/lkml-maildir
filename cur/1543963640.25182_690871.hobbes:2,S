Yeah, no idea when - although it looks like Nick has got another
speculative reference user lined up, which would greatly help its case.
Nick, can you post a series of patches against something recent that has
the latest lockless pagecache and all the fast_gup work in it, including
the power bits that use sepculative get?
We can then go over all this stuff and perhaps manage to trick Andrew
and Linus into taking it for .27.
Linus seemed interrested enough in the fast_gup bits.
And just in case someone forgot, the lockless pagecache has been in -rt
for a long long time - so far I've never seen issues with it.
