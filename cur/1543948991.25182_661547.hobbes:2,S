OK, I tried this out:  I built all 75 arm defconfigs with the cross
compiler above (the resulting log file is at
http://ozlabs.org/~sfr/armall.log.bz2
). 17 failed (I don't know why - I
didn't even really look).  If this is useful, I can get this added to our
infrastructure so that every linux-next kernel (and others as well, maybe)
will be built for all these.
Would that help, Russell?

P.S. From the timestamps in the log file you can see that this would take
around an hour each time.
