Hello...
I had this effect too here (RH7.1, Kernel 2.4.3), but i put it on a
wrong termination of the LVD Bus...be careful if you have LVD-Drives
with a "Termination"-Jumper...(e.g. IBM DGHS18V)...this Termination is
only usable if you use the drive as Single Ended SCSI-UW, *not* if you
use the drive i a true LVD-environment !
I learnt this the hard way, because i used this "Termination"-jumper and
the system bootet without problems and ran about 2 weeks...then the
above errors occured, followed by system crashes....after reading the
original ibm-docs, and not the oem-reseller-crap, the reason was clear.
Th second thing i noticed was, that the value for "Maximum Number of TCQ
Commands per Device" is per default on 255, but wirt my system the
driver always complained, that he could only use 64 ("locked on
64")...so i decided to switch to 32 and not to let him auto-detect the
max. value...since then i had no problems at all...
Solong..
Frank.

Microsoft isn't the answer.
Microsoft is the question, and the answer is NO.
