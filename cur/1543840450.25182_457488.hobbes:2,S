Absolutely not.
MMC is a little up in the air at the moment while I decide whether I want
to continue the cherade of being the maintainer of it.  It is a cherade
because the person doing 99% of the work is Pierre, and for some strange
reason, he's the one who gets all the bug reports.
This makes it extremely difficult for me to ascertain whether any patch is
correct or not - all I have to go by is the documentation, and as far as
I can see, the majority of the documentation I have says this patch is
wrong.
So I'm considering handing maintainership over to Pierre.  If I don't
have the support of the community, which is being voiced pretty loudly
by its actions, this move makes sense.
