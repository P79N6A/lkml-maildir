Hi Stephane,
I have built the kernel with the new patches and tried things out on x86_64 an 
x88_64 machine with Fedora Core 4.  I attempted use the new libpfm and pfmon to 
update the source RPMs and  I noticed that there were some return values from 
read() and write() being ignored. When pfmon is being built as an RPM ignoring 
the read and write return values cause the rpmbuild to fail. Attached is a 
simple patch that stuffs the return values into dummy variable to avoid the 
warnings. This patch allows libpfm and pfmon the source RPMs to compile on FC4 
and Fedora Core rawhide.
