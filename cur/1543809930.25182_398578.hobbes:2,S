I don't think that's really a fair statement.  The IBM people have
been active and responsive in maintaining their driving in the
openib.org svn tree.  However, they asked me to post their driver for
review because it would be difficult for them to do it.
IBM people: can you clarify the restrictions you have?  Why do you
feel you can't post your own driver for review?  Will you be able to
post smaller patches to lkml in the future if the driver is merged?
Thanks,
  Roland
