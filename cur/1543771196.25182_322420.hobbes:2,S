yes. As i said in an earlier mail:

local_irq_disable() is one way, preempt_disable() is another way. Adding 
asm("cli") to your driver is a third way. In practice these items are 
not a big issue, so i'm not yet covering them. It's a small detail.  
Check the amount of local-irq-disable instances in the driver space vs.  
spinlock use.
