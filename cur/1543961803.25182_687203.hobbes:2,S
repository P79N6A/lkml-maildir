Well, looks fine. It's edge triggered. My assumption that the
T1_INT_STS must be cleared is wrong since the complete HPET code
assumes edge-triggered interrupts. To use level-triggered interrupts,
the HPET must be programmed in level triggered mode, i.e. the
Tn_INT_TYPE_CNF bit must be set. Which is never done.
Back to the original problem. Can you please watch the interrupts from
the RTC until the lockup happens with something like
------------------------- 8< -----------------------------------
function get_total_irqs()
{
	sum=0
	for n in $(grep rtc /proc/interrupts | \
				 sed -e 's/.*://g' | \
				 sed -e 's/[a-zA-Z].*//g' ) ; 
		do sum=$[$sum+$n]
	done
	echo $sum
}
last=$(get_total_irqs)
while true ; do
	sum=$(get_total_irqs)
	echo $[$sum-$last]
	last=$sum
	sleep 1
done
------------------------- >8 -----------------------------------
Also, please send the full .config (maybe via private mail if that's
too large for LKML, or upload it).

Ok. Maybe don't use the patch I sent, instead use:
