Hi Chris,
Would you have less trouble if the "ROM" were actually more like a 
module?  Specifically, if it had a proper elf header and symbol table, 
used symbols as entry points, and was a GPL interface (so that ROM's had 
to be GPL)?  Then it's just a kernel module that's hidden in the option 
ROM space and has a C interface.
I know you end up losing the ability to do crazy inlining of the ROM 
code but I think it becomes a much less hairy interface that way.
Regards,
Anthony Liguori
