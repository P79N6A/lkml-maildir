Hi;
The last time i saw this LCP timeout coupled with the
"not 8-bit clean" error, it wasn't because of 7-8 bit
problems in PPP, but because the ISP (ibm.net in this case)
had started a term login instead of a PPP negotiation.
It was the LCP timeout that clued me in.
In my case it was because the chat script sent a Crtl-M
at the finish of the chat script (it was something like
an expect-send pair that went "CONNECT" "", and chat sent
a carriage return for the ""), and the other side interpreted
that as a desire to start a term login instead of PPP.
Hope this helps...
