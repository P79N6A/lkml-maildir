Huh, eh, what?  There's no such thing as multipath PCI configurations.
The important concepts in PCI are:
 - the function
 - the device
 - the bus
 - the root bus
 - the domain
 - the machine
That is, a machine contains one or more PCI domains, each domain contains
one or more root busses, each root bus may have bridges to a collection
of other busses, each bus contains one or more devices, each device
contains one or more functions.
Many people confuse the domain and the root bus.  HP has made many
machines with multiple root busses in a single PCI domain, particularly
in the PA-RISC line.  Frequently the topology of these machines looks
like this: 
http://www.hp.com/products1/itanium/chipset/2-way_block.html
Each of the six chips labelled "hp zx1 I/O adapters" is a host to PCI
bridge; thus this sample machine has 6 root busses.  Despite that, it's
a single domain -- all the devices are numbered so as to not overlap.
It's theoretically possible to communicate between devices under different
I/O adapters, but this isn't a supported configuration.
HP's multiple domain machines (eg rx8620) look something like several
of these tied together.  That's not really how it works, but that's a
good way to imagine them.
I haven't really looked at the VGA attribute.  I think Ivan or Grant
would be better equipped to help you on this front.  I remember them
rehashing it 2-3 years ago.
