Yes, of course I've read it.  It's lacking a number of important details.
For example, nowhere in devices.txt does it say that a device driver
should not create attributes in the struct device's directory since that
directory is owned by the bus driver.  (That's a very easy mistake to
make; at first sight it appears to be the natural way for a driver to
expose details of how it controls a device.)  In fact, nowhere in the
documentation does it say that you shouldn't attach an attribute to an 
object unless you own that object.  Maybe that seems obvious, but when a 
driver is bound to a device can't it be said to "own" that device in some 
sense?
The class.txt document does _not_ explain clearly what the differences
between devices and classes (or more properly, class devices) are.  It
merely says that "A device class describes a type of device..."  It
doesn't say what sorts of devices get to belong to a class; it doesn't
even list the existing classes yet!  (As you are obviously aware.)
Let me ask you this:  Given a device that doesn't fit clearly into any of 
the existing classes, how would you decide whether or not to create a new 
class for it?

Yes, but _which_ physical things correspond to devices?  And how should 
the parent-child relationships be decided?
Consider a concrete example: a USB host controller.  Let's say that on my
system /sys/devices/pci0/0000:00:07.2 is an OHCI HC.  That particular
object is created by the PCI bus driver, and directly below it is
/sys/devices/pci0/0000:00:07.2/usb1 -- what physical thing does that
correspond to?  Is it the virtual root hub?  It's created by the USB core;
where does the object created by the HC driver belong?
Or have I misunderstood, and was it intended from the start that _all_ the
objects under /sys/devices/ should be created by bus drivers, while _all_
the objects created by device drivers belong somewhere else?  Is that
somewhere else always under /sys/class/ (or /sys/block/)?  And where in
the documentation is this spelled out?

I'm still struggling... :-)
