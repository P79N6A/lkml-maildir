Yes I argue exactly that ;). That's a bug in the driver. For example if the
driver is an headactive device (q->headactive == 1) then the bug will also
corrupt memory (probably it isn't an headactive device because you said it
moves the request into its private lists). Otherwise it only forbids the
elevator to merge requests and optimze seeks away.
I think right behaviour of the blkdev layer is to BUG() if the driver eats
requests while the device is plugged.
