I'd been trying to reduce the amount of page swapping in order to improve the
kernels behaviour during thrashing as a project for my course.  I made this
after Arjan van de Ven and Rik van Riel suggested I looked into the swap
tokening mechanism as part of my research.  I came up with a function to
measure the swap rate and then to activate/deactivate the token mechanism
depending on how much swapping was being done overall.  I think the statistics
I added to the thrash.c file could help it decide how to behave but I'm unsure
how best to use them to do that.
I've tried testing it a few different ways
but none of them seem to make any difference.  I think this is because of my
tests though.  I made one program that allocates a linked list, until it is
128MB long, then once it's done that, it should swap in the oldest page in
order to free the memory and then swap the newest one back in to edit the
pointer to the next node then continue for 2 mins.  Then to test how much
progress is made
during the thrashing, I've been running a simple counter program that stops
after minute and I've been comparing the max number reached for the different
attempts I've been making with the kernel.  The program for causing thrashing
at least makes it swap pages because I can watch the memory and swap fill up in
system monitor.  Running the program to cause thrashing seems to work because
the kernel begins reporting high swap rates when the list reaches the target
length.
Does anyone know any programs that are designed to test this type of
thing or any comments on the code that I wrote?  I'm still new at this, so I've
probably misunderstood/left out some things.  The updateSwapRate() fuction is
called at the end of scheduler_tick().  That could probably go somewhere
better.  Also, I wasn't sure if changing the value of
swap_token_default_timeout was all I needed to do to reactivate the tokening as
it was disabled in 2.6.11 that I'm working with.
