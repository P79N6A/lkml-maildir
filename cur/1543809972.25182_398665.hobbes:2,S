Andi has a follow-on patch at:
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/gregkh-2.6/gregkh-03-pci/pci-give-pci-config-access-initialization-a-defined-ordering.patch
that should take care of these kinds of mmconfig issues by ordering the
pci config accessors properly.
Can you test this patch out to see if it fixes this problem on your
machine?
thanks,
