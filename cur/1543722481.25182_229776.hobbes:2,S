Not so pessimistic.

Nothing wrong with that partition table.
Maybe you get unhappy because of the fdisk output, but that only
shows that you have an old fdisk. Also there nothing wrong.
Ah - so the only wrong thing must be the fact that lilo stopped working.
I suppose things will improve if you give it the "linear" (or "lba32") flag.
What changed is that the kernel no longer attempts at guessing a geometry.
If such guessing is required, user space must do so itself.
