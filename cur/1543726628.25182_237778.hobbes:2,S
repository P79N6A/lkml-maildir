But as it's easy to tell which one is the secondary, just don't run the
userspace app for that device.  I don't recommend doing your "grab the
other device" hack in the driver, as it's not not a very nice thing to
do, and will probably break in the future.

Well, as your driver isn't even loaded at that point in time, it's a bit
hard for it to control that :)
