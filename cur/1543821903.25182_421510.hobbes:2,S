Sorry, but these comparisons to Windows are just childish.
Linux is not obliged to spit out meaningless, unhelpful error messages,
and be as user-hostile as possible. It's not a good trait. The current
error message is wrong ... if we can come up with something useful to
print, then great. But throwing 'Windows' around is not useful, and
neither are crappy, incorrect errors.
