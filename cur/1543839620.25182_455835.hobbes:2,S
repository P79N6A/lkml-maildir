Here is an updated patch.
while checking gcc 4.1 -Wextra warnings, I stumbled across the following
two warnings:
drivers/net/phy/phy_device.c:528: warning: comparison of unsigned expression < 0 is always false
drivers/net/phy/phy_device.c:546: warning: comparison of unsigned expression < 0 is always false
Since phy_read() returns an integer and can return negative values, as proposed
by Richard Knutsson this patch changes val to s32. Currently it is an u32, so the < 0 check
always fails.
