Slavon, I'm very glad of your testing and reporting, and I never
expected you test anything on production, when something else works
for you. On the other hand, what works for you could be unacceptable
for other users, who don't have such crashes, and prefer better
exactness. So it's hard to recommend such patches if there is not
enough people interested in them.
Best regards,
