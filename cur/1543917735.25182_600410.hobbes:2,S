Hi Rafael et al.
This looks like it will be vanilla material, maybe 2.6.23 material?

Hi,
I have recently run into build issue with 2.6.22 and tuxonice
2.2.10.3. When building custom kernel with make-kpkg the process
failed with the message saying: "fs.h requires linux/freezer.h, which
does not exist in exported headers". Here's quick-n-dirty patch which
fixes this. Hope it is usefull.
