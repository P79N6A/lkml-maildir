For the general case, that is true.
But note that the general case is usually a -single- structure being
initialized, not an array of structures.  Unless the struct members
being initialized vary wildly from one array element to another, using
named initialized it redundant and -reduces- the ability of the
programmer to look at the pci_tbl[] and evaluate its contents at a
glance.
PCI tables do not use named initalizers on purpose.  It was not an
accident or design mistake.
