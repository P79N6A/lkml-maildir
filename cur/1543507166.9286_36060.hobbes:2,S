uhm, so you have machines with old kernels that run OK by some definition.
when you slap semi-modern kernels on them, they crash.  for some reason, 
you blame the new kernels.
folks, modern does not imply bad.  you are DEFINITELY NOT "running a risk"
by participating in the 1999 Linux community, rather than reminiscing over
the good old 2.0 days.  that was 1996, btw...
frankly, modern kernels (ie 2.3.x) are so profoundly more efficient,
that it's entirely plausible that this hardware is simply borderline flakey.
for instance, mmap latency in recent 2.3's is literally 10x faster than in
2.2 kernels.  the dcache was an amazing speedup, as well...
regards, mark hahn.
