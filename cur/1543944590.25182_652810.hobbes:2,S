volanoMark has 45% regression with kernel 2.6.25-rc1 on my both 8-core
stoakley and 16-core Tigerton.
I used bisect to locate below patch.

    sched: group scheduling, change how cpu load is calculated
hackbench has about 30% regression on 16-core tigerton, but has about 10% improvement
on 8-core stoakley.
In addition, tbench has about 6% regression on my 8-core stoakley and
25% regression on 16-core stoakley. Some other benchmarks, like netperf/aim7
also have some regression. I will verify if they are all related to the
patch.
