Btw, the really scary thing is that I bet there are programs out there 
that "know" about kernel internals, and do things like
	#define CONFIG_SMP 1
	#define __KERNEL__ 1
	#include <asm/atomic.h>
in order to get the atomic helpers from the kernel, and using CONFIG_xyz 
markers to force the exact version they want.
And we will inevitably always end up breaking stuff like that. Nothing we 
can do about it - in the end, users can do infinitely odd things and know 
about our internals, and whatever changes we do will occasionally break 
some of the more incestuous code.
