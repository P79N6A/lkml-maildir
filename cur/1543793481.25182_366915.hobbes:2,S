Chris,
It seems as though there were messages that were still being sent to and
from your device when you disconnected it.  Try to make sure that you
quit all the software that was using the device, and if possible, remove
the kernel module that the device uses before removing the device.
You're right---it probably shouldn't cause an oops, but you should
probably make sure you aren't using it before unplugging it anyways.
