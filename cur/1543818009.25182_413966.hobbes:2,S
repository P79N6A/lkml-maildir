Agreed, does meminfo show that you are? The reason I ask is that I have 
noted that large memory machines and CD/DVD image writing suffer from 
some interesting disk write patterns. The image being built gets cached 
but not written, then the file is closed. At some point the kernel 
notices several GB of old unwritten data and decides to write it. This 
makes everything pretty slow for a while, even if you have 100MB/s disk 
system.

In theory you should be able to tune this, but in practice I see what 
you do. On small memory machines it's less noticable, oddly.
