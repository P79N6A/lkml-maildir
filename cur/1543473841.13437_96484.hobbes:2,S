Hi-
I had printing working fine before upgrading to 2.2.0pre[1/2].  I'm
using Redhat 5.2, and have an HP DeskJet 400.  lpq shows: "waiting for
lp to become ready (offline?)".  I think I've enabled all the necessary
kernel options for parallel port support. I have printer support
compiled as a module (lp.o) and it is loaded.  Does anyone know what
would cause this, or is there some additional info I should provide?
Thanks.
