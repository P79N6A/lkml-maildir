Jeremy, I added you to this discussion, because obviously you are 
suffering the same problem.

Sorry Johannes, that it seems I'm always waiting for your alarm to make me 
write a Mail - but this time I cannot add anything to find the problem - 
or maybe I can - not sure :):
I tested it with multiple dvb-usb devices in parallel - but never with 2 
Twinhan Alpha boxes.
Just a thought: Hugo, can you enable dvb-usb-debug and load the dvb-usb.ko 
with parameter debug=9 .
Then start the transfer and your syslog will be filled with messages of 
returning USB-buffers and their sizes. Try to catch some lines from both 
devices and send them here.
regards,
Patrick.
