I don't want to overcommit. If I do, then it must at managements direction,
not because they have no choice.

Sorry - when using modules, each data space of the slave server may get
more/less. Yes the base configuration data doesn't change, but that is
a very small part of what goes into a web server.

It is part of the issue. The system would never go OOM, users would go
OOR (Out-Of-Resources). Out of resources is a manageable entity, that
can be adjusted from the results of performance analysis. OOM is a
catastrophic failure of the system. If the system doesn't provide a
way to control it, direct which user is at fault, and as directed by
management policy, then that system is considered buggy and not ready
for production use.

Right now there is no way to determine which proces should get terminated.
