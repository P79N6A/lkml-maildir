Was root=nfs removed on purpose or is it an unexpected
side effect of the "ROOT NFS fixes" patch from late
July 2003?
I understand this patch from the point of wanting to
eliminate nfs attempts when nfs is not requested.  That
is clearly a reasonable thing to do.  However, "root=nfs"
is a nfs request that has been accepted in the past, I've
been told, because nfs isn't a real device (but maybe it
was accepted as bug and this patch fixed it).
