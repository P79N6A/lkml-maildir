[patch to disable freezer deleted]
First of all, excuse me for being a quite lousy tester. Could not come
around to try bisecting, no time at all. Yesterday in the autobus I gave
a shot to this "wild test" and I report the results here.
- The good (?) news. I have made 7 suspend/resume cycle (to ram, I
haven't tested hibernation) with a 2.6.21.2 with that patch, applied
manually. The system did suspend and resume nicely even compiling a
kernel and opening openoffice. Normally (le me stress _normally_) no
delay was apparent on resume. I do not know how dangerous is this... :-)
- The bad (?) news. One time out of 7 I had the 60 seconds delay. I
attach here the dmesg(s) of the resumes,  a good one, a delayed one, and
another good one after a reboot (where you can, by the way, see the
dancing serial effect... the card is sometime /dev/ttyS1,
sometime /dev/ttyS2).
