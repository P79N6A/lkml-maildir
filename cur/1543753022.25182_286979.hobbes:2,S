Are you sure it is a bug? kswapd has been recently fixed so it properly
starts freeing memory before the critical shortage is reached where
processes have to synchronously free memory for themselves.
This will make kswapd take more CPU time, but it should be doing work
that would otherwise need to be done by someone else. The lack of any
swapping activity indicates that kswapd is not actually having too much
trouble freeing memory (or you have swap turned off!)
If you still think it is a bug, if kswapd keeps running after the compile
stops, or if the system stops doing useful work, then let's see what the
problem is:
Can you make sure you kernel is compiled with "magic sysrq key" turned
on (under kernel hacking menu). While the weird kswapd behaviour happens
next, press alt+sysrq+m 3 or 4 times, then dump dmesg to a file
`dmesg > dmesg.out`, and send that file in.
Thanks,
Nick
