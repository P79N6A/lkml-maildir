It's the same file, but not the same memory map.  It basically depends
on how you define msync:
 a) sync _file_ on region defined by this mmap/start/end-address
 b) sync _memory_region_ defined by start/end-address
b) is a perfectly fine definition, and it's consistent with what this
code does.  The fact that POSIX probably implies a) (in a rather
poorly defined way) doesn't make much difference, I think.
