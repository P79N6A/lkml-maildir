The overhead is fairly high to run the benchmark.  It's not a one minute run.
(more or less like a 5 hour exercise.  Benchmark run time along is 3+ hours).
-mm has so many stuff, I'm not sure we would have the bandwidth to do a search
on which patch trigger N% regression, etc.  Let me try the base kernel first
and if resources are available, I can attempt to do it on -mm tree.
