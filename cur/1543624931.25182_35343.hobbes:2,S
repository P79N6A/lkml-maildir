I don't know about you, but to me the difference between technological
thrill and masturbation is that real technology actually matters to real
people.
I'm not in it for some theoretical good. I want my code to make _sense_.

TLB load instructions + hardware walking just do not make much sense if 
you allow the loaded entries to be victimized.
Of course, you can have a separate "lock this TLB entry that I give you" 
thing, which can be useful for real-time, and can also be useful for 
having per-CPU data areas. 
But then you might as well consider that a BAT register ("block address 
translation", ppc has those too), and separate from the TLB.
