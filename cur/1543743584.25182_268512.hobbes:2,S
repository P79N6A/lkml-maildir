hi again,
i *think* i found the ChangeSet leading to the bug i tried to report in
 http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=109888178603516&w=2
the error is sill present here (and only here? strange...), the latest -BK
does not fix it. i had some difficulties in telling BK to do the right
thing. to summarise the error:
- - upon loading of snd_ens1371 the Oops occurs. system is still stable
then, but no sound available.
- - this occured somewhere between 2.6.9 (released 15-Oct-2004) and 2.6.9-10
(released 22-Oct-2004)
one interesting changeset was:
ChangeSet@1.2000.7.1, 2004-10-20 20:33:06+02:00, perex@suse.cz
  Merge suse.cz:/home/perex/bk/linux-sound/linux-2.5
  into suse.cz:/home/perex/bk/linux-sound/linux-sound
i tried to back it out:
$ bk clone -r1.2000.7.1 linux-2.6-BK linux-2.6-BK-test
but the said ChangeSet was still there (of course). i tried to back it out
(now for sure):
$ bk undo -a1.2010
(hm: the changesets get renumbered everytime i "do" something with the
tree) this one reverted quite a few ChangeSets but i let it happen.
compiling & booting this thing goes fine and i am now running 2,6,9-BK(?)
with working snd_ens1371.
if someone could give me a hint here what to do next or perhaps tell me
that the whole things was totally pointless - please say so.
i am somehow lost as to which is the right person to bug here.
thank you for your time,
Christian.
