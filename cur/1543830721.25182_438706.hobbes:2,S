Thanks for the time you've been pouring into this.  Copying kernel header
into applications clearly didn't work too well, especially for arch stuff
(two dozen and counting ...) it was a pain and each distribution had
different sets of hacked kernel headers.  So I hope this will restore
some sanity - and same for klibc.
