Yes, that's where the NAPI stuff originates. The core patch from that
site is what made it into 2.5, and I backported it to 2.4 from there.
There are no substantial differences between the three.

While the core is mostly a matter of changing patch offsets, the driver
patches are still a moving target. There are two different flavors of
the e1000 NAPI patch, for example. The most recent tulip patch from the
above FTP site is missing tulip_misc.c, so it must be replaced with a
version from another patch.  That file really is only code to report
stats in /proc, though. There's yet another napified tulip driver that
jamal posted a link to; I have yet to investigate that one.
But to answer your question, yes. I just found the most recent versions
of various napi efforts and made them apply to a recent 2.4 kernel so
people can easily try out the new net core.
