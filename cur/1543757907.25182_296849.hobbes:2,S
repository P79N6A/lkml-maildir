Well, first off, sending SysV messages from the kernel is a pretty 
bizarre thing to do. Secondly, you can't just call the system call from 
inside the kernel and pass in kernel memory, because the system call 
expects to deal with user-space memory. You'd have to duplicate some or 
all of the code of msgsnd and change it to just read the memory directly 
  instead of using copy_from_user, etc.
