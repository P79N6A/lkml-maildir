Subject: 2.5.66-(bk) == horrible response times for non X11 applications

The X server is not reniced nor are any of the called tasks. This is very 
easy to reproduce by doing the following;
open two xterms, run glxgears from one and then 5 or so seconds after that 
run an application which you can easily determine completion, such as 
ifconfig. You will notice that the console app doesn't make much progress 
and essentially get's starved.
