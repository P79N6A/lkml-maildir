I recently attempted to upgrade from test1 to test8 and came across the
following error when I boot:
VFS: cannot open root device "2102" or unknown-block(33,2)
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
I have the filesystem of my root built into the kernel (ext3) and also
have pci ide and my ide chipset driver built in. I had this same issue
with test 5-7 as well though, but test 1 (the last one I've really
tried) works fine. I also have a friend with different hardware but the
same circumstances who encounters the same problem. Any help would be
appreciated.
Following is anything that might help in finding the cause:
