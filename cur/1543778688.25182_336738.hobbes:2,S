All the problems are born here:
struct sym_entry {
    unsigned long long addr;
    unsigned int len;
    unsigned char *sym;
};
I suppose you want sym to be an unsigned char to store the type and to do
the checksum math in there.
And why use a 64bit address in 32bit archs ?. There is no math involved
with 'addr', so you can make it a pointer and let the compiler decide its
size.
Why don't you do something like:
struct sym_entry {
    void		*addr;
    unsigned char	type;
    unsigned short	len;
    union {
	unsigned char	data[KSYM_NAME_LEN+1];
	char		name[KSYM_NAME_LEN+1];
    };
};
Option b) is identify the five lines that do the checksum math and plague
them with (unsigned char) casts...
Will try to do it...
