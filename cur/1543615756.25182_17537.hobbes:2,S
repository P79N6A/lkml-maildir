yes, we can do the following: instead of sending the broadcast IPI, we can
skip CPUs that run a RT task that has a higher priority than the one that
just got woken up. This way we send the IPI only to CPUs that have a
chance to actually preempt their current task for the newly woken up task.
We do this optimization for SCHED_OTHER tasks already, behavior like this
is not something cast into stone.
this way you can mark your RT task 'uninterruptible' by giving it a high
RT priority.
i'd also like to note that Davide's description made the broadcast IPI
solution sound more scary than it is in fact. A broadcast IPI's handler is
pretty lightweight (it does a single APIC ACK and returns), and even a
pointless trip into the O(1) scheduler wont take more time than say 10-20
microseconds (pessimistic calculation), on a typical x86 system.
and there is another solution as well, we could simply pick a single CPU
where the RT task preempts the current task, and send a directed IPI. This
is similar to the reschedule_idle() code.
The reason i made the IPI a broadcast in the RT case is race avoidance:
right now our IPIs are 'inexact', ie. if the scheduling situation changes
while they are in flight (they can take 5-10 microseconds to get delivered
to the target) then they might hit the wrong target. In case of RT/SMP,
this might end up us missing to run a task that should be run. This was
the major reason why i took the broadcast IPI solution. Eg. consider the
following situation: we have 4 runnable RT tasks, two have priority 20,
the other two have a higher RT priority of 90. We do not want to end up
with this situation:
	CPU#0					CPU#1
        prio 90 task running			prio 20 task running
	prio 90 task pending			prio 20 task pending
because the pending prio 90 task should run on CPU#1:
	CPU#0					CPU#1
        prio 90 task running			prio 90 task running
	prio 20 task pending			prio 20 task pending
situations like this is the main reason why i made the RT scheduler use
heavier locking and more conservative constructs, like broadcast IPIs.
