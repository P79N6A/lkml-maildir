I may be wrong, but afaik the 0xff's are there to truncate the other values to 
8-bit. 0xff == 0b11111111, which is 8-bit.
From the bitshifting above, cpu_rev seems to be a 32-bit value, so the four 
sections of cpu_rev (>>24, >>16, >>8 and >>0) are being ANDed with 0xff to 
show only the 8 low bits (post-shift).
