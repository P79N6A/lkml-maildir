Sorry, I misunderstood your message.
Yes, we can freeze it with FE_HOTPLUG_CPU. In that case wait_event()
should also check !freezing(), and try_to_freeze() should be called
after case wait_event().
On the other hand, if "kthreadd" does not sleep on kthread_create_work,
we have another unfrozen process waiting for kthread_create_info.done.
So, is there any practical reason why kthreadd() should explicitely go
to refrigerator?
Oleg.
