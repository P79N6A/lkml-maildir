This patch clashes in non-trivial ways with
ext2-convert-to-new-aops-fix.patch and perhaps other things which are
already queued for 2.6.24 inclusion, so I'll need to ask for an updated
patch, please.
Also, I'm planing on merging the ext2 reservations code into 2.6.24, so if
we're aiming for complete support of 64k blocksize in 2.6.24's ext2,
additional testing and checking will be needed.
