   [netdrvr 8139cp] PCI MWI cleanup; remove unneeded workaround
   
   * The PCI layer now handles incorrect cacheline size settings,
     as it should.  Remove our own workarounds.
   * Move pci_set_mwi up much earlier in the probe process,
     and check its return value.
   * Call pci_clear_mwi() in ->probe error handling
   * Call pci_clear_mwi() in ->remove

   [netdrvr 8139too] don't start thread when it's not needed
   
       The thread for was unneeded on chips other than CH_8139_K/8129. So,
       this patch doesn't create the thread on chips other than
       CH_8139_K/8129.
   
<hirofumi@mail.parknet.co.jp> (03/08/31 1.1116)
   [netdrvr 8139too] remove driver-based poisoning of net_device
   
   Harmless in 2.4, but causes oopses on rmmod in 2.6.
   
   slab poisoning can take care of this for us, anyway.

   [netdrvr 8139cp] must call NAPI-specific vlan hook
