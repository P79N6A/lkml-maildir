The comment in the mail is inaccurate because patch 6/6 will account for 
the kernel image and mem_map as holes for all architectures if it is 
merged. The patch could be submitted independent of arch-independent 
zone-sizing.

They are comparatively big and cannot be freed.

There was at least one benchmark/use case where it made a significant
difference, can't remember the exact numbers though.
It affects the low/high water marks in the VM zone balancer.
Especially for the 16MB DMA zone it can make a difference if you
account 4MB kernel in there or not.
