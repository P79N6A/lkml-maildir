Really? I would have expected all performance sensitive apps to read
in >=PAGE_SIZE chunks. And if they don't because they split their
dataset in blocks (like some database), it may not be so wrong to
activate those pages that have two "hot" blocks more aggressively than
those pages with a single hot block.
So I've an hard time to advocate to prefer the current behavior, but
certainly this can be "fixed" by caching the last_offset like others
pointed out ;)
