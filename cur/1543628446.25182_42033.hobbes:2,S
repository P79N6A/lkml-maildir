I believe -pre's are still important. Daily snapshots are too likely to be
broken, and "real" releases are different from -pre ones (with *usefull*
difference): you can ignore -pre release, but you can't ignore real release
(because real releases are relative to each other).
Having slightly more frequent real releases would be nice, but I believe
it is not feasible to make them as common as pre- patches.
