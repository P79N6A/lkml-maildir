Hans,
the l-k community have asked YOU may times.  any lack of response isn't 
because of the kernel cabal .. its because YOU are refusing to entertain 
any notion that what Reiser4 has implemented is unpalatable to the 
kernel community.
you can threaten all you want to take your code and move it to BSD.  or 
fork the kernel.  whatever.
but if you want to get your work into the mainline kernel, you need to 
provide answers to the question that keeps being asked of you - and 
which you patently keep ignoring time & time again.
in short,  as per Message-ID: <42BBC710.8010906@cisco.com>:
    posting to l-k on "why Reiser4 cannot use VFS infrastructure for
    [crypto,compression,blahblah] plugins" - ideally, for each plugin.
or again, in Message-ID: <42BBB1FA.7070400@cisco.com>:
    [..] but instead just understand that this is the framework that you 
have to
    work in to get it into the mainline kernel.
    if you don't want to go down that path, you're free to do so.
    its open source, you can keep your own linux-kernel fork.
    but if you want to get your code into mainline, i don't think its
    so much a case of l-k folks telling you how to make your code
    work under VFS.  the onus is on you to say WHY your code
    and plugins could never be put into VFS.
or further back in Message-ID: <42BB7083.2070107@cisco.com>
    you know that VFS is the mechanism in Linux.  you know
    (i hope..) how it works.  it isn't so hard to see how many
    of the Reiser4 "plug-ins" could be tied into VFS calls.
    OR, if they cannot TODAY, propose how VFS _COULD_ be
    made to do this.
NB. it doesn't matter what David thinks.  this is linux-kernel, not 
linux-users.
cheers,
lincoln.
