Indeed. I write a program at one time doing random allocation and 
de-allocation and looking at what the output was, and buddy is very good 
at avoiding fragmentation.
These days we have things like per-cpu lists in front of the buddy 
allocator that will make fragmentation somewhat higher, but it's still 
absolutely true that the page allocation layout is _not_ random.
