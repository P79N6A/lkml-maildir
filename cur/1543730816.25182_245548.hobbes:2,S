Subject: [PATCH] i386 bootmem restrictions
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/8/26/89

The bootmem allocator is initialised before the kernel virtual address space
has been fully established.  As a result, any allocations which are made
before paging_init() has completed may point to invalid kernel addresses.
This patch notes this limitation and indicates where the allocator is
fully available.
