This needs fixups due to competing changes.  Please review:

o [CORRECT] stir4200 - get rid of reset on speed change The Sigmatel 4200
  doesn't accept the address setting which gets done on USB reset.  The USB
  core recently changed to resend address (or something like that), so
  usb_reset_device is failing.
The device works without doing the USB reset on speed change, it just
will be less robust in recovering when things get wedged (like coming
out of FIR mode).
