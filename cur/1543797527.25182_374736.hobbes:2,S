I agree that breaking things is bad, but it would be interesting to see what 
would happen and if anyone complains.  A gut feeling is that very few people 
use more than the two serial ports that come on their motherboards.  Where I 
work out of the 2,500 PCs on campus, only 3 or 4 PCs actually use a serial 
port.  I think this would be a good survey for slashdot.  I don't use the 
serial ports on my PCs.  I do use the serial ports on my servers.  The 
serial ports on the servers connect to a digi terminal server.  One serial 
port is the management interface to the server, the other is setup for 
serial login.
The reason I started this thread is because I wanted to know why/how I was 
seeing 32 serial ports in /dev when I have 0 enabled on my PC and I have 2 
serial ports on my servers.  Thanks to the responses I have a better 
understanding of what is going on.

sysfs is way outside my area of understanding.  Anything that moves to a 
more accurate /dev directory is good in my book.
Thanks,
