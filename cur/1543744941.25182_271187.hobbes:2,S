My Mellanox HCA driver -- subversion tree at
    
https://openib.org/svn/gen2/trunk/src/linux-kernel/infiniband/hw/mthca
can use multiple MSI-X vectors with this kernel API.  I'll be
submitting it for upstream inclusion soon, so please don't remove the
kernel support.
Of course there isn't a yet stable device firmware release that
enables MSI-X ;(
Thanks,
 Roland
