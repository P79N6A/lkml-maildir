i've tried it again with the above patch applied and when i start
cdparanoia i get:
kernel: hdc: write_intr: wrong transfer direction!
kernel: cdrom_newpc: dev hdc: type=2, flags=114c9
kernel: 
kernel: sector 59534648, nr/cnr 0/0
kernel: bio 00000000, biotail c14b2800, buffer 00000000, data 00000000, len 56
kernel: cdb: 12 00 00 00 38 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 
as for the lock up, the ripping process never completes, it starts and
then it hangs somewhere in the middle of the track. it could be that
the disk has some problems. anyway, abort execution doesn't work until
i physically eject the cd from the drive (which seems to be an
improvement from a couple of rc's ago). hope this helps.
