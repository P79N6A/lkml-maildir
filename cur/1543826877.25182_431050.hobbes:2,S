This is not the intended use of the socket API when distinguishing
between services. The socket() call has a protocol field that is usually
unused and it exists precisely to disambiguate multiple protocols with
the same generic behaviour but different properties.
	s = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_UDPLITE);
is probably the right way to do this, keeping 0 "default" as before
meaning IPPROTO_UDP
