Hello,
Is there a way to optimize the IDE layer to handle DVD
read errors more gracefully ?
Most used DVDs (borrowed from a local library, etc.) seem to have some 
defects. Those cause the IDE layer to get stuck for quite a while, 
interrupting the movie playback. It might be better to just return an 
error for that sector and let the player software continue.
I wonder if it would be possible to tune the IDE layer by i.e.
reducing the number of retries and disabling the controller reset, etc.
I haven't fiddle with the below numbers, yet. Just wondering if that
could improve the situation, or if there are any other tricks that one 
could play here ?
/*
  * Probably not wise to fiddle with these
  */
#define ERROR_MAX       8       /* Max read/write errors per sector */
#define ERROR_RESET     3       /* Reset controller every 4th retry */
#define ERROR_RECAL     1       /* Recalibrate every 2nd retry */
Cheers,
Mathias
PS: Also which DVD ROM do people recommended in general ?
     Which one seems to have a decent error correction scheme
     not just a high read speed?
