Seems like changing the default limits would be the easiest way to
fix it then?
As far as hardware limits go, I don't think you need to scale that
number linearly with the amount of memory you have, or even with the
IO throughput. You should reach a point where your command overhead
is amortised sufficiently, and the controller will be pipelining the
commands.
