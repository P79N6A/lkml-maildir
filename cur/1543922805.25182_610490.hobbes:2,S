Hi,
It seems very similar to my case, where it is very easy to
completely trash the computer in 30 seconds.
Conf: core2 cpu, 2gb memory, 2gb swap, 64-bit os.
Software: latest stable xorg, firefox2, latest gnash (all from gutsy)
Go to site 
http://www.epl.ee/
 and almost immeditately you loose
control of your computer - mouse gets very jerky, clicks aren't registered,
switching consoles doesn't work. If I'm quick enough, I can go and log
on over ssh remotely and kill all gnashes. But some moments later even
that is not possible. It just trashes hard drive.
Yes, one could set up different limits and what-so-ever ... but my point 
is -
it is tooo easy to kill your linux computer (or your friends server). 
This should
be changed.
With best,
Lenar
