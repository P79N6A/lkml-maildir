Subject: Increasing dmesg buffer size?

What kernel parameter do I need to modify in the source to allow a
larger dmesg buffer?  I have a lot of boot messages and I currently
loose about 10-20 lines immediately and they can not even be seen in
/var/log/dmesg because that file gets dumped after those lines are
already gone.  Thanks to anyone who can help.
