Probably it would make sense also for distro vendors to make linux-next 
snapshosts available in their development distro branches (redhat's 
rawhide, opensuse's factory, etc), to make it easier to test by those 
users who are willing to test if it works in their environment, but don't 
want to compile kernels themselves.
