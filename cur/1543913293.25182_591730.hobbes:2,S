Thanks.  For man-pages-2.66 I have added the following text to execve.2:
   Limits on size of arguments + environment
       Most Unix implementations impose some limit on the total size
       of the command-line argument (argv)  and  environment  (envp)
       strings  that may be passed to a new program.  POSIX.1 allows
       an implementation to advertise this limit using  the  ARG_MAX
       constant  (either  defined  in <limits.h> or available at run
       time using the call sysconf(_SC_ARG_MAX)).
       On Linux prior to kernel 2.6.23, the memory used to store the
       environment  and  argument  strings  was  limited to 32 pages
       (defined by the kernel constant MAX_ARG_PAGES).  On architec-
       tures  with  a  4-kB page size, this yields a maximum size of
       128 kB.
       On kernel 2.6.23 and later, most architectures support a size
       limit  derived from the soft RLIMIT_STACK resource limit (see
       getrlimit(2)).  For these architectures, the  total  size  is
       limited  to  1/4  of  the  allowed  stack size, the limit per
       string is 32 pages (the kernel constant MAX_ARG_STRLEN),  and
       the  maximum  number  of strings is 0x7FFFFFFF.  (This change
       allows programs to have a much larger argument  and/or  envi-
       ronment  list.   Imposing  the 1/4-limit ensures that the new
       program always has some stack space.)  Architectures with  no
       memory  management  unit  are  excepted:  they  maintain  the
       pre-2.6.23 limit.
Cheers,
Michael
