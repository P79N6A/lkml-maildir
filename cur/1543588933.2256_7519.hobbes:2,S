Hello Andre,
Sorry for responding a little late. I spent some time in the big blue
room (not that is was that blue lately!).

OK, and here it is (I extracted this out of the *BSD ata-raid.h):
This is the hpt-raid config block located at offset 0x1220 (sector 9).
All data is stored in little endian format.
0x0020 32 bits; magic cookie
	0x5a7816f0 for good array
	0x5a7816fd for bad array
0x0024 32 bits; raid volume cookie
	used to distinguish between raid volumes
0x0028 32 bits; raid-10 volume cookie ???
0x002C 32 bits; order bitmask
	0x04 status is OK
	0x02 striping
	0x01 mirroring
	Note: bits 0 and 1 appear to matter only in raid 10
0x0030 8 bits; disks in array
0x0031 8 bits; chunksize (1U << (*this+9))
0x0032 8 bits; raid level
	0x00 raid 0
	0x01 raid 1
	0x02 raid 10 & raid 0 (not supported)
	0x03 span
	0x04 raid 3 (not supported)
	0x05 raid 5 (not supported)
	0x06 single disk
	0x07 raid 10 & raid 1 (not supported)
	Note: raid 10 is done with raid level = raid 0 and order = ( mirroring
| striping )
0x0033 8 bits; disk number in array
0x0034 32 bits; raid volume size in sectors
0x0038 32 bits; disk mode ???
0x003C 32 bits; boot mode ???
0x0040 8 bits; boot disk ???
0x0041 8 bits; boot protect ???
0x0042 8 bits; error log entries
0x0043 8 bits error log index
0x0044 32x error entries
	32 bits; timestamp
	8 bits; reason (0xFF=broken, 0xFE=removed)
	8 bits; disk
	8 bits; status
	8 bits; sectors
	32 bits; lba
Mine looks like this:
001220 f0 16 78 5a b3 04 b3 84 00 00 00 00 04 00 00 00
001230 02 05 00 00 c0 2a 28 07 00 00 00 00 78 56 34 12
001240 a5 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
001250 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
This is the signature of the first disk in a raid0 with 2 30GB disks and
16k chunk size.
Everything related to raid 10 is a bit weird, and I am not sure if the
BSD code is 100% accurate there. I am goint to install Abit's Gentus on
my system. This distro states that it supports most Abit hw quite well.
Maybe there is some good sourcecode somewhere...

So you want that an ata raid level reuses the existing raid code?

Well, I guess that is the reason why people keep kicking and banning me
from IRC channels...

Perfect! Since FreeBSD supports that controller, do you think Highpoint
would provide us "offical" documentation? Or do you already have some?
Do you want to have a look at my module? As I said only raid 0 is
implemented, but anyway...
I try to get written down what HPT would need from the API in hard
facts.
bye,
Wilfried
