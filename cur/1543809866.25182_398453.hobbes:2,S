Roland, your comments are fine, but what about the original author's
descriptions of what each patch are?
Come on, IBM allows developers to post code to lkml, just look at the
archives for proof.  For them to use a proxy like this is very strange,
and also, there is no Signed-off-by: record from the original authors,
which is not ok.
And why aren't you using the standard firmware interface in the kernel?

It's a "p" file?  What's that?
Is this even needed?
