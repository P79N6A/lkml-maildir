ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_timeout func only: 14
I get alot of this both with 2.4.10 and 2.4.9-ac17. This results in dma getting turned off and a slow disk.
The way to reproduce it is running "find . -type f |xargs wc >/dev/null" and wait a while. I have so far tested a few different configured kernels and never once completed the above command on a 30GB filesystem without getting the hd to drop out of dma.
I have two disk one on the motherboard IDE and one on a promise ultra66. Both have the same problem.
