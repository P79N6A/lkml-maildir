Not that much finally, because I cannot reproduce the slowdown I initially
observed with the original function on local variables. I think I may have
had a wrong type somewhere or a particular operation which prevented gcc
from fully optimizing the macro :-/
So at the moment, both the original and my version are the same speed on
local variables on athlon-xp.
BTW, I don't understand why, but I've just noticed that the Alpha is 25%
slower on my version when used on local variables !
So my version is only interesting when working on indirect variables, which
is never the case in the kernel... Never mind, that was just a try.
For info, here's what I measure here on the original version :
 - athlon-xp : 24 cycles, whatever -march/-mcpu
 - alpha ev6 : -mcpu=ev5       : 22 cycles
               -mcpu=ev6       : 24 cycles
 - sparc64   : default         : 26 cycles
               -mcpu=v9        : 24 cycles
               -mcpu=ultrasparc: 19 cycles (18 cycles for my version here)
Considering that the Alpha and the UltraSparc can issue up to 4 instruction
per cycle, I wonder whether it would be worse trying to implement such a hash
in assembler, optimized for each processor, with a default fall-back to the
C function for archs that have not been implemented.
Cheers,
Willy
