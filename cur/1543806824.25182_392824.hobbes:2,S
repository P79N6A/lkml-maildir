I'll assume that when you say "page owned by a user program", you're
meaning a private page, not a shared file page mapped into the program.
If you're asking about what currently happens, the answer is "No".
If you're asking about what you can assume, the answer is "Yes".
The kernel is entitled to move them if it wishes, various people
are interested in page migration, and one application would be if
the system is short of free memory of a particular kind, and your
page is on such memory, and it would help to move it elsewhere.
