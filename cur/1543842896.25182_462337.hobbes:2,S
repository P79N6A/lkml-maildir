As I understand it, in systems with virtually indexed caches, the OS must
take care to ensure that a given cacheline appears only once in the cache,
even if it is mapped to multiple virtual addresses.  If an OS failed to
do this, then, as far as I can see, all bets are off.  Curt Schimmel's
book "UNIX(R) Systems for Modern Architectures: Symmetric Multiprocessing
and Caching for Kernel Programmers" is an excellent guide to the issues
posed by virtually indexed and virtually tagged caches.
In principle, one could construct a virtually indexed/tagged CPU cache 
that automatically ejected any line with a conflicting physical address
(given that lookups are presumably much more frequent than loading new
cache lines), but I have no idea if any real hardware takes this approach.
I have had the good fortune to always work with physically tagged/indexed
caches.  ;-)
						Thanx, Paul
