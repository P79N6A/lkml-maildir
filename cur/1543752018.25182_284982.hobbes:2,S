Unfortunately my english is not on a par with this but this document 
*needs* updating at every corner and after that the direct hyperlink to 
this document on the kernel.org should be placed above links of the 
kernel source (currently it is somewhere at the middle of the page). And 
the note "please read before using vanilla kernel" should be in red. It 
*seems* to me that there is a big cap between reality and this 
document/common sense (in the days of heavily patched kernels and 2.6 
devel. model). There should be several separate parts in this document: 
for kernel developers, for distro makers, for "smart" users, for 
"enthusiasts"....
regards,
Indrek
