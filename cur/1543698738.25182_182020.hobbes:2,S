_Probably_ no hardware damage, but I do not know for sure.  I do not it 
will likely lockup, and data corruption is also a possibility.
As I mentioned in another email, ICH5 hardware does not support hot 
removal.  HOWEVER.  If the OS driver is given sufficient notice, it can 
shut down the port, and the sysadmin may then unplug the SATA cable.
As a tangent, your TX4 hardware fully supports hotplug, but libata does 
not yet support it.
