Hmm, it doesn't do what I meant and I don't think you solved
the problem. You still check against the vaddrs
which won't work for ioremaps or fixmap (and thus not
fix the EFI cases)
What I meant with restructuring is calling lookup_address() early,
get the physical address from the PTE, then check that against
the alias ranges in physical. That would actually work for fixmaps
and ioremaps and all other mappings too.
I'm sure it can be all done, but for me it to submit such
a change would likely require weeks of thread like this so
I'm not trying.
