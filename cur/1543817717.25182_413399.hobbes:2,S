Right. One could use more expensive processing here.

Correct. We may want to audit the kernel and check that each 
for_each_possible_cpu or for_each_cpu is really correct. Developers 
frequently assume that all processors are up. There may be some 
complicated interactions with cpusets. Adding Paul to this.
However, note that I am not interested hotplug functionality. It is going 
to be a difficult task to make the kernel shutdown processors correctly. I 
can give you feedback but I am not going to do this work.
