On a -ac kernel with mode 2 or 3 set for overcommit you have to run out
of kernel resources to hang the box. It won't go OOM because it can't.
That wouldn't be a VM bug but a leak or poor handling of kernel
allocations somewhere. Sadly the changes needed to do that (beancounter
patch) were things Linus never accepted for 2.4
