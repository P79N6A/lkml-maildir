Which gets us back to refcounting.

As an abstract object a kpid to me means a single identifier which
uniquely identifies the process and which in its component parts be they
pointers or not uniquely identifies the process in the container and the
container in the system, both correctly refcounted against re-use.

Thats where we disagree strongly. Wrappers hide, confuse and obscure. We
want the workings brutally and clearly visible so that people don't make
assumptions and have nasty accidents. Its like typdedefs and overuse of
defines.
