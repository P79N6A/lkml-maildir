Mr. Torvalds,
        I understand that you are a very busy man, but would it be 
possible for you to take a few moments to explain the following statement?
I'm very interested for your reasons - it's not often that one gets to    
hear OS design theory from someone who maintains/develops/architects a
real, working,  useful OS kernel.  I'm sure that many other CS students
would be greatful for an explanation on this as well (not to mention those
who thought that a pre-emptable kernel would be a good thing).  Thank
you.
