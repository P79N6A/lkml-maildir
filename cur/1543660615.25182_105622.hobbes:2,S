Lets see what logs tell:
    @grabjohn.com linux-kernel relaying denied
  yiding_wang@agilent.com linux-kernel user unknown
Agilent had front-end system loosing its database/mind temporarily
(but 1 hour "temporary" is 10-60 bounces depending on the hour...)
Cases of "relaying denied" (wording varies) are fairly easy to understand.
Cases where systems have temporary insanities are most difficult to analyze...
