Now I see what you have done. You are sharing the same tfm between your
aes version and the "old" asm version. Both assume different private
data (aes_ctx vs crypto_aes_ctx) so this should not work.

You have to it if you want to bypass the crypto layer and call asm
functions directly and I'm not sure whether bypassing the crypto layer
is a good thing. Both asm routines (the 32bit and 64bit) assume that
keylen ist at +0 followed by enc key, dec key. Ach and they don't do the
ALIGN thing.
Herbert what do you thing?

The latter is fine. I just want to avoid having several and different
aes_set_key() around.

Ah okay. So depending on how expensive kernel_fpu_begin() really is it
might be slower for just the cipher (i.e. in xts(aes) where xts calls
you for every 16bytes).
