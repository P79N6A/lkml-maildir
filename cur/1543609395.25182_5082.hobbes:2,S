linux/isapnp.h has the following code:
---
#if defined(CONFIG_ISAPNP) || (defined(CONFIG_ISAPNP_MODULE) && defined(MODULE))
 
#define __ISAPNP__
---
I believe the pnpbios driver should do things something similar. Users of 
the interface should then only check for #ifdef __PNPBIOS__.
The reasoning behind this is the following: When you have a driver 
built-in, but pnpbios modular, the driver cannot use pnpbios 
functionality. The above definition reflects exactly this.
(BTW: The drivers using ISAPnP functionality seem to generally get this 
wrong, I'll look into cleaning this up. In drivers/scsi/aha152x.c it's 
done right)
