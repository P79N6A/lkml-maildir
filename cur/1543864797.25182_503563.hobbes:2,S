So, this means, on suspend():
1. Don't worry about TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
2. Do worry about TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE
We have to cease IO and must not call wake_up_interruptible()
Isn't that a race until suspend() is called?
On resume():
1. Don't worry about TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
2. Do not restart IO that may call wake_up_interruptible()
When do we restart such IO?
