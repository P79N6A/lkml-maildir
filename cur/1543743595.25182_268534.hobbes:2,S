In any case, if a process is sleeping in-kernel, I expect that either 
it's an
interruptible sleep or a guaranteed-short sleep.  If it's neither, it's 
a bug.  If
I kick out an ethernet and it makes "ping" hang in "D", that's bad.  I 
think
that eventually _all_ kernel sleeps on the behalf of user-space 
processes
will become interruptible.
