Hi,
I've got some problems with booting a 2.4.19 (and other 2.4 kernels).
The system is a P4 2.0 Ghz Northwood, Epox 4G4A+ (i845g) with onboard HPT372 
and Realtek LAN, 512 MB DDR Ram, 80 GB Seagate IDE Disk at IDE1 and a CDROM 
at IDE2. I am not using the HPT IDE Ports at this time (also tried with 
disabling the HPT in the BIOS.
Ok. Whenever i try to boot a 2.4 Kernel (i tried the ones provided by the 
Debian 3.0 boot cd, Knoppix boot cd and a p4 optimized gentoo kernel) It gets 
as far as:
Loading kernel..................
Loading 
rescue.gz.......................................................................
ready.
Uncompressing Linux... Ok, now booting the kernel.
Then it hangs.
Is there a way to get more information what exactly it is doing before it 
hangs ?
