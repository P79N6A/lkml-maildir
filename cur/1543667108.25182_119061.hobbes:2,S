By the way, we've been incrementally updating both trees and while in 
theory the incremental could result in shorter paths with less detail,
so far the incremental export and the one pass export result in exactly
the same path:
    slovax $ bk _eventpath 1.0 + | wc -l
       8498
    slovax $ cd ../linux-2.5-cvs/linux-2.5
    slovax $ rlog -r -N ChangeSet | grep revision
    revision 1.8498
I've actually reimported the data in one pass and diffed the RCS files,
it's the same.
HPA, should we be mirroring the CVS tarballs to kernel.org?
