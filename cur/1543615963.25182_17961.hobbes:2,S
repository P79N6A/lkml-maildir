Oh there is. To compute the correct VM behaviour requires knowledge of
what the workload will do in the future. Now if you can solve the halting
problem and/or invent time travel I'm waiting to hear.
There are heuristics, and Linus goal is the right one. Its just useful to
recognize someone will always have a load you get wrong. Most users don't
understand tweaking vm configurations, yet even windows NT boxes let you do
so. For the critical jobs there will be someone who is willing to make the
effort to learn how to tune it.

Now that is definitely not the case. I'm not talking
