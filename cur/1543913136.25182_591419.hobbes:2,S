It seemed much more painful for me to implement. :-)
I'll look into this, but I think for this to be done, the changes must 
be in the cxgb3 driver, not the rdma driver, because the guts of the 
netdev struct are all private to cxgb3.  Remember that this interface 
needs to still do non TCP traffic (like ARP and UDP)...
Maybe you have something in mind here that I'm not thinking about?
Steve.
