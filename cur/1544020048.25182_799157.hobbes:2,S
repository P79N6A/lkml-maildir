No objection to max_delta_ns being increased, but whatever code manages
it will probably need to query the timekeeping core in some fashion to
make sure the timer hardware max isn't larger then the clocksource
hardware max. I've provided a rough sketch at what the timekeeping code
would probably look like below.

There may be some other issues here, such as NTP over-correction issues
(for instance: ntp trying to correct for a 1us offset over the next
second, but ends up applying it for 10 seconds) if we defer for a really
long time. But at that point, we might as well suspend to ram, like the
OLPC does.
