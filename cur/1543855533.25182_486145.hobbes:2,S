i have released the 2.6.19-rc6-rt8 tree, which can be downloaded from 
the usual place:
    
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
lots of fixes are included in -rt8. In particular the inode/dentry leak 
found and fixed by Karsten Wiese (and the related OOMs reported by 
others) should be fixed.
I also started tracking Linus' latest -git tree, so all upstream 
stabilization fixes since -rc6 are included in -rt8 as well.
[ the latest KVM patchqueue is now included in -rt too. KVM should not
  impact anyone unless enabled. The YUM rpms have KVM enabled on both
  i686 and x86_64. ]
to build a 2.6.19-rc6-rt8 tree, the following patches should be applied:
  
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.18.tar.bz2
  
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/patch-2.6.19-rc6.bz2
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/patch-2.6.19-rc6-rt8
the -rt YUM repository for Fedora Core 6 and 5, for architectures x86_64 
and i686 can be activated via:
   cd /etc/yum.repos.d
   wget 
http://people.redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/rt.repo
   yum install kernel-rt.x86_64   # on x86_64
   yum install kernel-rt          # on i686
   yum update kernel-rt           # refresh - or enable yum-updatesd
as usual, bugreports, fixes and suggestions are welcome,
	Ingo
