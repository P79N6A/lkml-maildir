Probing is somewhat broken in 2.6.18 - something in the core code
changed as its upset quite a few drivers at once. One case causes
repeated errors and finally detection of an ATAPI device, the other
causes repeated errors and then failure when no device is present but
takes a few minutes and keeps IRQs locked off for long periods. Both
appear to be fallouts from the new EH code.
