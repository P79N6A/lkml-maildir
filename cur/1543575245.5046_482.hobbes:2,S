Subject: [PATCH] Re: kernel BUG at buffer.c:827 in test12-pre6 and 7
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Folks, see if the following patch helps. AFAICS it closes a pretty real
race - we could call block_write_full_page() for a page that has sync
IO in progress and blindly change ->b_end_io callbacks on the bh with
pending requests. With a little bit of bad luck they would complete before
we got to ll_rw_block(), thus leading to extra UnlockPage(). All it takes
is a pageout on a page that got partial write recently - if some fragments
were still unmapped we get to call get_block() on them and it can easily
block, providing a decent window for that race.
Fix: postpone changing ->b_end_io until the call of ll_rw_block(); if by
the time of ll_rw_block() some fragments will still have IO in progress -
wait on them.
Comments?
						Cheers,
							Al
