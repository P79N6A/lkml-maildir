Yes, if a signal is pending, then msleep_interruptible will not return
0.  That means we will not loop but will call aoenet_xmit with a NULL
skb, which is a noop.  So if the system is too low on memory or the
aoe driver is too low on frames, then the user can hit control-C to
interrupt the attempt to do a revalidate.
I will add a comment to that effect in the resubmitted patch.
