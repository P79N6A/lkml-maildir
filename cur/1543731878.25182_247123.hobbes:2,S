True, No one was holding a gun to his head.   :)

I "choose" to stop at stop signs and red lights.   Yay me.

My experiences: Binary drivers make Linux harder to support, harder to
distribute, harder to administrate and harder to maintain in production.
While they provide short term benefits, their long term impact is
negative. One example: What happens when company X goes out of business
or stops supporting the device?
A decision has been made: My understanding is that the Binary portion is 
moving to user space and the devices in question will still function
as a result.   
Please move it off the kernel list.
