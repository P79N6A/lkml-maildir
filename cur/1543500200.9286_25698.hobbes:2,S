Macrohard did - all directories were reported with size 0 !!!
I can also report that on my 4k block systems, I never see directories
smaller than 4k in size, but that's (A) expected, and (B) desired.
I can understand the viewpoint that says the "size" of a directory is
simply a count of the number of valid entries therein, but I don't
agree with it.
Best wishes from Riley.
