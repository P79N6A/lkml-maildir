By the way, is there any real need to specify default governor at
a compile time in the first place?  Performance governor (which was
the only default so far) is a very simple one (not large to consider
its size effects for embedded systems for example), and switching
governors at run time is trivial as well.  What's the motivation
behind this new config option?

Oh well.  Which leads to more surprises in the future, I think...
Thanks.
