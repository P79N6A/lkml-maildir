Oops.  I missed the sunrpc case.  This patch fixes it:
http://www.ibm.com/linux/ltc/patches/misc/cred-2.5.30-6.diff.gz
I think I mostly nailed the intermezzo case.  I did go through it.

I disagree.  It won't generate bogus values of any of these fields.  There
may be some cases where it'll pick up a combination of before and after
values, but I don't see where any of that is fatal.

Spinlock isn't nasty overhead, if it's not contested. It seems to me that
checking whether it's shared is as much overhead as just taking the lock.
