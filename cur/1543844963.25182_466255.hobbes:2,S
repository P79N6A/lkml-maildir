Ok, then this is something you should take back as feedback to your
CPU designers. With the behavior you describe, the interrupt latency
(until the point where an application runs) can be up to one jiffy
longer than it should be, which is unacceptable for many real-time
users.
Worse, it means that you can not use the CONFIG_NO_IDLE_HZ option in the
future, because you have no way to guarantee that you ever wake up from
idle if you hit the race.
