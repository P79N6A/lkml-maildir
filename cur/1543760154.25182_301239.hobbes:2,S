Hi Scott,
The above three ioctls are for dpa/managment. If I removed these ioctls, 
I have to remove jsm_mgmt.c(patch5.jasmine).
Do you mind I remove jsm_mgmt.c code now? From my side, I  don't think I 
need them now.
Maybe we can have a solution in the kernel as Russell and Greg said later.
Thanks,
wendy
