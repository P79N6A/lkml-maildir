Subject: [PATCH] mwave config fix and module tags
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linus..
This patch includes the necessary changes to allow folks to configure
Mwave support...  It seems that those changes didn't get merged
with the rest of the Mwave..  It also includes the MODULE_* tag changes from
a previous patch by Thomas Hood..
It applies against 2.4.11-pre6..
Cheers...Paul...

+ACP Modem (Mwave) support
+CONFIG_MWAVE
+  The ACP modem (Mwave) for Linux is a WinModem. It is composed of a
+  kernel driver and a user level application. Together these components
+  support direct attachment to public switched telephone networks (PSTNs)
+  and support selected world wide countries.
+
+  This version of the ACP Modem driver supports the IBM Thinkpad 600E,
+  600, and 770 that include on board ACP modem hardware.
+
+  The modem also supports the standard communications port interface
+  (ttySx) and is compatible with the Hayes AT Command Set.
+
+  The user level application needed to use this driver can be found at
+  the IBM Linux Technology Center (LTC) web site:
+  
http://www.ibm.com/linux/ltc/
+
+  If you own one of the above IBM Thinkpads which has the Mwave chipset
+  in it, say Y.
+
+  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
+  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
+  The module will be called mwave.o. If you want to compile it as
+  a module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt.
