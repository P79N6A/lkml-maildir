Ok, I'll do that.
However, I don't know whether this is exclusively related to the PC300
driver ... Some questions keep bugging me:
- Why does it happen only in 2.3.x kernels??
- Why does it happen only when there are concurrent IDE accesses (i.e., if
  the incoming file is directed to /dev/null, the problem does NOT
  happen)??
- Why does it happen only with concurrent _IDE_ accesses (i.e., it does
  NOT happen when I use a SCSI HD instead, being everything else in the 
  system still the same)??
Please let me know what you think.
Thanks in advance for any additional help.
Regards,
Ivan
