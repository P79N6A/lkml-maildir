RFC793 says to short cut TIME-WAIT when a SYN arrives and to enter
CLOSE.
RFC1122 says it should not be short cutted
Linux is compliant to RFC793 here.
Alan used a somewhat extended notion of the RFC1337 TW Assasination -
to mean any event that could short cut TIME-WAIT -- RST and SYN. In this
case the SYN assinates the TIME-WAIT.  tcp_rfc1337 controls if TIME-WAIT 
can be short cutted at all.
He turned the fix off for some other reasons, and we just inherited that
in 2.2
According to RFC1122 it is a bug yes.
