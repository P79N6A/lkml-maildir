After found the above problem, did it all again to be sure:
   make mrproper
   rm -r /lib/modules/*
   cp ../config-2.6.16.19 .config
   make menuconfig    ( made sure it's same config, then saved without
                        changes )
   make
   make modules
   make modules_install
   make bzlilo
Same result.
