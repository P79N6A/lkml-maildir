That's not necessarily true.  I work with a bunch of guys who make very
little money and are always scrounging parts to enhance their machines. 
$200 for a disk drive is two weeks salary.
This is in Mexico where the scholarnet project is trying to put Linux in
140,000 schools and other computing centers and I work in an area where
wages are "high". The people trying to come up with this many computers
in Mexico are going to be doing a lot of scrounging old hardware with
little money to enhance machines.  And those kids are going to take home
a desire to run (and grow into hackers) on Linux in a home environment
where wages are often less than $1/hr.
I personally could deal with the kernel if it grows to twice the current
size, but keeping it as small as possible is very __important__ for
Linux's expansion onto the desktop in developing nations and hence,
important for developers to keep in mind.  Just a thought.
