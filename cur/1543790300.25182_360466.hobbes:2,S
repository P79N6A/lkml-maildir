Subject: can someone explain how to implement callback in kernel?

I am writing a device driver. I want to achieve asynchronous I/O. What
I want to do is as follows:
1. the driver issues a request to the device. Instead of waiting , it
schedules a callback,  then return.
2. after the device serves the request, the callback should be
triggered to finish the rest of work for this request.
This seems to be a standard callback working flow. But I don't know
how to implement this. Can someone give me a brief idea or point me to
some link about this?
Thanks in advance!
Xin
