Hi,
We've got the following situation here:
   outside
     |
     |
   --+----+ 145.89.82.x
          |
         masq firewall (F) 145.89.82.251
          |                145.89.82.165
          |                192.168.1.251
          |
       ---+----+ 192.168.1.x
               |
              internal box (C) 192.168.1.13
What I want:
  Box C should be accessible for some ports on IP 145.89.82.165.
  Outgoing connections from this IP should appear to come from
  145.89.82.165 also... BUT other machines on the internal 192.168.1.x
  netwerk should come from the 145.89.82.251 primary IP.
What works:
  Incoming connections:
  - Accomplished with "redir" program.
What doesn't:
  - Outgoing connections for that specific IP over the specific alias.
Question:
 How do I do it, and even better CAN it be done?
 The system currently runs a 2.2.13 kernel but another 2.2.x shouldn't
 be a problem... 2.3 is too unstable at the moment though...
Greets,
 Jeroen Massar
