Dear list,
following this list for quite a while now raised the above question.  To get
more specific:
Given an SMP system with many thousand processes and a potentially high network
and IO load, what is the best combination of source and patch, to make best use
of SMP, keep load low and throughput high?
Is it 2.4.x + rmap or aa or O(1) or ac or some combination
OR ist it 2.5.x + one (or more) of the above patches ???
Many thanks for the help and Happy Thanksgiving!
Immanuel
