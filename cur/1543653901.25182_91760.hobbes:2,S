Which is pretty stupid, btw.  There are more than enough scsi HBA drivers
or emulation drivers outside drivers/scsi.  I have a longstanding plan
to rationalize the scsi headers (the current state is really really messy),
and that includes moving everything but the truly midlayer-specific parts
like non-exported function to headers in include/scsi/.
