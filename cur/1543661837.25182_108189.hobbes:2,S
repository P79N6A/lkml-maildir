Maybe unrelated, but there is some really ugly code in
char_dev.c:get_chrfops().
There, if one needs a character device that is not present
a request_module("char-major-%d") is done.
However, if the character device has TTY_MAJOR or TTYAUX_MAJOR
and a driver for this major is requested, and we already have
one, but it is the wrong one, then we also do the request_module.
Yecch.
The reason is of course that entirely different drivers cover
different fragments of the major space (4,1 is /dev/tty1 and
4,65 is /dev/ttyS1)
So, I could imagine that if one has neither module, and needs
one, get_chrfops() loads the wrong one. Speculation.
