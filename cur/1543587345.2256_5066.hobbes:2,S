Still experimenting with my SDT-9000... tried connecting it to another
controller
(2940AU in place of 2904, sorry but I've only Adaptec stuff :). Same
problem.
Tried with another tape (even with an old DDS-2 tape). Same. Even tried
another
cable/removing the CDWR drive from the bus.
It seems that the tape is written incorrectly. I wrote some large file
(300MB)
and read it back four time. The read copies are all the same. They differ
from the original only in 32 consecutive bytes (the replaced values SEEM
random). Of course, 32 bytes in 300MB tar.gz files are TOO MUCH to be 
accepted :)
Now I'll build some old 2.2 kernel to try...
