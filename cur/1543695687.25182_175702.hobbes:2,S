At the moment, edd.c doesn't actually use it.  It wants to -
find_bus() is a useful concept, but I haven't proven that the scsi_bus
list only has scsi_devices on it, so that code isn't compiled in at
present.  If the scsi_bus list is clean now, then yes, I'll want to
turn it back on (after 2.6.0 is out) and will need find_bus() to be
possible.
Thanks,
Matt
