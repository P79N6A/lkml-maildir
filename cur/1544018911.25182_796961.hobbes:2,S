Yes, Nick's patch is not supposed to fix this, it's just a fix of a 
comment in the source code, that has no effect on the behavior of the 
driver. So this is completely separate issue, that you should report to 
the proper place, which is
	BROADCOM TG3 GIGABIT ETHERNET DRIVER

	L:      netdev@vger.kernel.org
	S:      Supported
