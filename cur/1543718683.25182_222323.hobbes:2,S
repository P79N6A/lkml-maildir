The saving and restoring is where things are looking icky.
It does not look like that kernel_fpu_begin() will work safely in
an interrupt context.
The generic x86 variant is to do:
fild
fistp
Which works for 64bit values because the floating point registers
have a 64bit mantissa.
I suppose I could unconditionally save the x87 floating point registers
to a local variable, but that sounds like a terribly expensive operation.
At least with kernel_fpu_begin() the floating point save only
needs to happen once, per context switch.
With SSE it is easy to save just a single register.  For the x87 I don't
see how to do that.  Beyond the stack based nature of the x87 there is
the question if the registers are in mmx mode or not.
I guess a conservative always correct version would be a place to start.
