The reiserfs nfs problem in standard 2.4 is very simple -- it'll barf as soon 
as you run out of file handle/inode cache. Any workload that accesses
enough files in parallel can trigger it.
Fixes do exist, but require bigger changes in nfsd.  Basically you need to
hand out an 64bit inode in the nfs filehandle, and pass the upper 32bits
to the low level file system for efficient lookup (actually is all not 
too difficult to implement, just requires very uncodefreezefriendly changes
to nfsd)
