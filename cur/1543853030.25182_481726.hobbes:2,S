Hi,
I want the kernel (2.4) to display (just using printk) all available
devices with full path (/dev/...) before the root filesystem is
mounted. So I'm trying to add something into mount_block_root function
in init/do_mounts.c to do it. But I really haven't got any idia what
exactly I should do. Can you help me please?
Thanks a lot.
