As was I.  And the reason I wrote this upper layer is that you
clearly stated multiple times (at the SAS BOF and in mail) that
you're not interested in this upper layer.

Just in case it was clear:  I'm paid for this transport class by Dell.
I don't have any contractural relationship with LSI or HP, although these
companies (like most sucessfull hardware vendors) know that giving hardware
to linux people active in the area they care about helps to get thos people
actually fixing things about instead of just bitching around..

I abosultely want to.  To quote from my first minimal transport class
announcement mail:
"I hope this will integrate nicely with the top-down work Luben has done
once he finally releases it publically, but for now I think we should have
something so SAS drivers can go in the tree."

We need both a transport class in the original sense aswell as a library
for host-based SAS HBAs, and they need to play together nicely - whatever
term you give to them.

I know.  And we still want to cover it with a common base for what we
can have common.
