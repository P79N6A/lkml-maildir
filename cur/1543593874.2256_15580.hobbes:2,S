I had difficulties making it all work on ServerWorks III LE
based machines, most notably 2450 & 6450.
Dell fixed 2450 eventually, BIOS needs upgrade to level A11.

The line above says that MP table contained the device.
This is the situarion with 6450 - they have the MP entry,
but there is no way to make it work. I am working with their
BIOS and hw engineers on a fix.
For the moment the workaround is to run the whole thing
with "noapic". Try it, perhaps it helps the machine in question.
