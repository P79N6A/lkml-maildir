I'd like to know the model numbers (and firmware revisions) too.
The drive knows how many LBAs it has, and making sure the span of the
command is within the valid LBA space is one of the first things
checked.
Another possibility of for clunking is if the drive is damaged and
cannot track follow in a region, the drive will go to the latch and
push off repeatedly attempting to reacquire servo information.  That
can be scary sounding if you haven't heard it before.
Not saying the bug is impossible, but I'd like to know more.
