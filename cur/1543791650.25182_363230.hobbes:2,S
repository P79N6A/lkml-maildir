Hello Andrew,
We have in the DVB subsystem most of the exported symbols as 
EXPORT_SYMBOL itself, rather than EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL. I think if this 
needs to be changed, we would require a global change of all symbols to 
the same to maintain consistency. If you require that change we can have 
a change but i would think that the discussions be done with the 
relevant copyright holders too, eventhough probably most of the authors 
won't have any objection.

It is not necessary limited to dvb-pll, but the entire dvb-kernel.
Thanks,
