Nope and nope.
This is a special case where the user asked for zero bytes and the kernel
gave him 8 (or 32) bytes instead.
If slab was smart enough, it would have poisoned those 8 bytes to some
known pattern, and then checked that they still had that pattern when the
memory got freed again.
But it isn't smart enough, so the bug went undetected.
As I said, it's specific to the kmalloc(0) problem, and we're fixing that
by other means anyway.
