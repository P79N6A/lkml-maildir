Nothing which applies clean at the moment and I have no access to the
box where the patch floats around.
It's simply explained.
Current code:
set_timer()
	calc interval->jiffies / interval->arch_cycles;
	based on it.interval
rearm()
	timer->expires += interval->jiffies;
	timer->arch_cycle_expires += interval->arch_cycles;
	normalize(timer);
Patched code:
set_timer()
	timer.interval = it.interval; 
	timer.next_expire = it.value; 
	both stored as timespec
rearm()
	next_expire += interval;
	calc timer->expires/arch_cycle_expires;
	
So on each rearm we eliminate the rounding errors and take the drift
adjustment into account.
It adds some calculation overhead to each rearm, but ....
