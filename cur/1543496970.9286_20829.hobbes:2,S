Another reason for large page sizes has nothing to do with I/O. On
an architecture where TLB misses are expensive (e.g the Origin2000)
a larger page size can have a big effect on performance for 
applications that access a lot of memory. Running one numerical
simulation that I use on the O2K with 16K pages is around 20% slower 
than running it using 64K pages.
