Subject: Kernel panic on PC with broken hard drive, after DMA errors

My laptop hard drive recently died (or is in the process of dying).
HP wanted me to do some more tests before sending me a replacement, so
I tried booting Linux again today.  I got lots of DMA errors, which
was really to be expected, but then I got a kernel panic.  While I'd
not blame the kernel when a panic occurs with broken RAM or CPU, I'm
sure sure the kernel should panic just because of a broken IDE drive.
I posted a picture of the panic at

Is this something that can be fixed or is my hardware really so broken
that the kernel cannot deal with it?
