Fix a race where __block_prepare_write can leak out an in-flight
read against a bh if get_block returns an error. This can lead to
the page becoming unlocked while the buffer is locked and the read
still in flight. __mpage_writepage BUGs on this condition.
BUG sighted on a 2-way Itanium2 system with 16K PAGE_SIZE running
	fsstress -v -d $DIR/tmp -n 1000 -p 1000 -l 2
where $DIR is a new ext2 filesystem with 4K blocks that is quite
small (causing get_block to fail often with -ENOSPC).
