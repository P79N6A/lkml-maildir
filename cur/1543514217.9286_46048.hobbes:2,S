My bad.  I should have add to my posting that yes, I indeed looked
into documentation and paid attention what shows up on my screen
and, at least accordingly to what my mixer says, I did unmute
this Trident driver.  As a matter of fact my mixer claimed at some
moment that all controls were at 100%.  Now can I have no more
messages advising me to do that?  This is a good advice but,
unfortunately, does not seem to be relevant in this case.  At least
if my mixers do not lie (I tried a few different ones).
Any other ideas?  Waiting in an anticipation...
