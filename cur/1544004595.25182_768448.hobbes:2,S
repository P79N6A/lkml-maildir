Subject: [PATCH] memcg: add  force_empty again in reasonable style.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/11/13/7

tested on x86-64 box + mmotm-Nov10.
after this, force_empty is not only for debug but for usual use.
Thanks,

By memcg-move-all-accounts-to-parent-at-rmdir.patch, there is no leak
of memory usage and force_empty is removed. force_empty allows users to leak
account. 
This patch adds "force_empty" again, in reasonable style.
memory.force_empty file works when
  #echo 0 (or some) > memory.force_empty
  and have following function.
  1. only works when there are no task in this cgroup.
  2. free all page under this cgroup as much as possible.
  3. page which cannot be freed will be moved up to parent. (locked pages etc.)
  4. Then, memcg will be empty after echo returns.
This is much better behavior than old "force_empty" which just forget
all accounts. This patch also check signal_pending() and above "echo"
can be stopped by "Ctrl-C".

 A cgroup can be removed by rmdir, but as discussed in sections 4.1 and 4.2, a

-5. TODO
+5. Misc. interfaces.
+
+5.1 force_empty
+  memory.force_empty interface is provided to make cgroup's memory usage empty.
+  You can use this interface only when the cgroup has no tasks.
+  When writing anything to this
+
+  # echo 0 > memory.force_empty
+
+  Almost all pages tracked by this memcg will be unmapped and freed. Some of
+  pages cannot be freed because it's locked or in-use. Such pages are moved
+  to parent and this cgroup will be empty. But this may return -EBUSY in
+  some too busy case.
+
+  Typical usage of this interface is calling this before rmdir().
+  Because rmdir() moves all pages to parent, some out-of-use page caches can be
+  moved to the parent. If you want to avoid that, force_empty will be useful.
+
+
+6. TODO
 
 1. Add support for accounting huge pages (as a separate controller)
 2. Make per-cgroup scanner reclaim not-shared pages first
