Yep, I remeber this was the case in some old alpha. But did they support
smp too? I can't see how that old hardware could support smp. If they're
UP they're fine.
The race is extremely tiny anyway, you'd need to write to the
/proc/<pid>/ file at the same time that used_math is toggled.
Or alternatively you'd need to kill the task due oom at the same time
used_math is toggled.
The race in PF_MEMDIE is more serious.
And false sharing with memdie and oomkilladj is zero, since they're
pratically readonly.
