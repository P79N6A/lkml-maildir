Hello,
Well maybe not on all kernel revision, but all I tested the EMU10K1 on there
(most off the time I use ALSA, which as the same bug...).
The bug is that the card as two audio output, they both deliver good sound
for playing wav or mp3, but only one of them deliver the sound that came from
the line in (same for the CD in).
I am sorry if that's not a bug and if there is an easy way to hear the sound
out of the two output (same sound out of the two output, just mirrored).
Thanks you very much,
	Greg
