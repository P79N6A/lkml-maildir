Looks fine, except I'd ask you to split up the get/set logic as separate
functions, instead of making that case-statement thing horribly big.
Big functions are bad.
So please make it look something like
	case PTRACE_GET_THREAD_AREA:
		ret = ptrace_get_area(addr, (struct user_desc *) data);
		break;
	case PTRACE_SET_THREAD_AREA:
		ret = ptrace_set_area(addr, (struct user_desc *) data);
		break;
instead, ok?
