Yes, definitely sure that X is configured correctly (it works fine when
I boot with 2.2.19) I have also tried gpm, which works fine under 2.2,
and under 2.4.8 tells me there is no such device or address, and under
2.4.13 and 2.4.13-ac7 locks my keyboard and doesn't work.
Thanks for the suggestion, though.
