It's pretty inconsistent with the source code of enqueue_hrtimer().
The only possibility to have a callback from enqueue_hrtimer() is in
hrtimer_enqueue_reprogram() in the HRTIMER_CB_IRQSAFE_NO_RESTART
case. Such timers can not be requeued in interrupt context, hence the
name HRTIMER_CB_IRQSAFE_NO_RESTART :)
Also in hrtimer_interrupt context, hrtimer_enqueue() is called with
reprogram = 0, which ensures that we do not call
hrtimer_enqueue_reprogram().

Let's gather some more information. 
Renato, some questions:
1) is this fully reproducible with updatedb ?
2) are you sure that this is the first stacktrace you captured, there
might be some BUG before that which scrolled out of sight. Any chance
to use a serial console ?
3) Can you please recompile the kernel with CONFIF_DEBUG_INFO set
and then run the following addresses from the backtrace through
addr2line with the new vmlinux:
# addr2line -e vmlinux 0xc013dad9 0xc0107c3b
Please provide the output.
4) Looking at your .config it seems you have some more patches applied
aside of the .16 stable. Can you please upload a full patch queue
somewhere ?
Thanks,
