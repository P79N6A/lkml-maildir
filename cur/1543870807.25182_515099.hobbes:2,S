I not arguing several fb driver's backlight code isn't broken, it is. We
have a Kconfig problem though since we used to stop users selecting
things that didn't work and now we're allowing them. Worse still, the
defaults break for people. That is a regression.
Anyhow, the patch I proposed should let people enable/disable it at
runtime with defaults known to work which should address the problem
until someone figures out how to fix the backlight drivers themselves
properly.
Cheers,
Richard
