But the patch is fundamentally broken wrt preemption at least, and it 
looks totally unfixable.
It's also overly complex, for no apparent reason. The simple way to avoid 
the wrmsr of SYSENTER_CS is to just cache a per-cpu copy in memory, 
preferably in some location that is already in the cache at context switch 
time for other reasons.
