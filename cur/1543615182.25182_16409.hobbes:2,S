Subject: [PATCH] C undefined behavior fix

[Cc: to gcc list, in case someone wants to argue about standards]
The appended patch fix incorrect code, which interferes badly with
optimizations in GCC 3.0.4 and GCC 3.1.
The GCC tries to replace the strcpy from a constant string source with
a memcpy, since the length is know at compile time.
Thus 
   strcpy (dst, "abcdef" + 2)
gives
   memcpy (dst, "abcdef" + 2, 5)
However, GCC does not handle the case, when the above offset (2) is
not within the bounds of the string, which result in undefined
behavior according to ANSI/ISO C99.
The error is that
   strcpy (namep, "linux,phandle" + 0xc0000000);
gets emitted as
   memcpy (namep, "linux,phandle" + 0xc0000000, 14 - 0xc0000000);
