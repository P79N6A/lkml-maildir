  I'm curious, would running contest after a fresh boot and with profile=2
provide a profile that tells exactly where time is being spent?  Since
about 2.5.45 I've had some strange slow periods, and starting aterm
would take a while, redrawing windows in X would slow down, it 'feels'
like my workstation becomes a laptop that is just waking up.  Sometimes
this is after only a few minutes of inactivity, or after switching
virtual desktops in kde, or when I have alot of aterm instances running.
 Normal activity for me involves untarring and compiling lots of
software on a regular basis, on a 1.2Ghz celeron and 256mb of mem.  I'm
using 2.5.46+reiser4 patches at the moment.  I'll boot to 2.5.46-mm1
shortly, but I'd love to use reiser4 with akpm's tree though.
Would oprofile help figure out why aterm gets so effing slow at times?
I guess I need to sit down and figure out how to use it.
