Kernels that previously worked fine all now experience the same symptom. Even RH's own kernels exhibit this. The kernel built Nov 24th works, Nov 26th doesn't. gcc was updated 26th, 14 hours earlier.

If you are referring to the "compat" RPMs, be aware that they use the 
current headers, which is a good or bad thing depending on what you want 
to do. If you want to build old software, you get to keep a down-rev 
virtual machine to do it right :-(
