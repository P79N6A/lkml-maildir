I guess they're tracable for nvidia. I'm not aware of how nvidia
Linux development works. I assumed from the lack of bug reports that
they had done something about it. I concede that bad support from
a vendor might cause a bad perception of Linux.

I didn't mean that in an elitist way (you shouldn't be compiling
kernels unless you are taller than the sign) - I just mean the knowledge
required to recompile the kernel and nvidia drivers. And the people
with that know how should generally know that the binary modules
can be unstable. Again I concede this won't always be the case.
