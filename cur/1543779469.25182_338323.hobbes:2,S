This is largely a confusion of terminology.  On the SATA page,
"host-based TCQ" == host controller has a hardware queue (DMA ring, or 
whatnot)
"legacy TCQ" == making use of READ/WRITE DMA QUEUED commands.
I would only consider accepting the -intersection- of these two feature 
sets, where host TCQ and legacy TCQ are -both- present.  As an extremely 
low, low priority.  :)
As a terminology side note, the SATA community refers to "everything 
that is not NCQ" as "legacy TCQ".  Legacy TCQ doesn't necessarily imply 
use of the standard PCI IDE interface, handling SERV interrupts and all 
that nastiness.
Patches to software-status.html to make this more clear are certainly 
welcome, as well :)
