It reminds me, we had a similar problem in the 2.4.x kernel with 
many SCSI hosts loaded - that caused scsi_malloc (which uses DMA) 
to consume a lot of DMA memory and trigger the OOM. I know that code 
was much rewritten for 2.6.x, through DMA allocations in the SCSI 
subsystem (regardless of drivers) still exist here and there.
