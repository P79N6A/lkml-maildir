there is a critical difference between RT that can be accomplished
statistically or through buffering and RT that cannot. Not that showing
video is unimportant, but that the methods you use to smooth video
presentation are different than what you use to  control a machine tool
with little jitter. 
And while some networking needs hard RT, for most networking is it not
correct that a few dropped packets now and then are worth higher
throughput in general?
Of course, the correct solution is tht the RT patch be added to the
standard kernel, but then you should be aware that it will be
important to make sure that  it is alsways clear what is using the RT
interrupt control and what is not, so that RT is not used to 
compensate for lack of design in components that are not RT.

If you meant millisecond, I agree. But I am not hopeful that one 
can achieve this without a major redesign.
On the other hand, Gigabit ethernet means a packet every 1.5us.

I proposed to Linus about 2 years ago that we should make some fast atomic
data structure tools available to driver writers so that they can ignore
most synchronization issues. He correctly suggest I send in some working
code, but  ...
what bothers me is three problems of incorrect analysis
(A) Hard Realtime is not needed nearly as often as people suppose and 
  it is often invoked as a shorthand for "my application can be optimized
  by pessimizing everything else."
(B)   The  tradeoff between optimizing common case and optimizing
 worst case is easy to ignore.
(C) One of the reasons why RTLinux is useful is that it decouples
  the hardRT component from the main OS. Many people do not understand
  why this is important and see it as merely an inconvenient design
  flaw. But to imagine that something as complex and fundamentally 
  geared towards common case performance as Linux can be put in a blender
   with an RTOS  to produce a palatable result is delusion.

There are excellent reasons to avoid spls. Among these reasons, not
all architectures support them, and hardware ideas of priority are often 
completely wrong. However, it is quite easy to use the RTLinux soft
interrupt handler to provide arbitrary grouoings of interrupt sources so that
you could have a 
             disable_network_interrupts
which might disable  atomically  a serial device carrying hdlc, 2 pic
network cards and a firewire/ngio type device. 
And without RT, something like
      void __not_reentrant__ my_irq_handler( .... )
would  be useful especially if  "return" then would generate 
delayed calls.
