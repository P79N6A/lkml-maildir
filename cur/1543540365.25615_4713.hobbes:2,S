Hi!
  I have a newer patch which I have tested but I need more people to try
it out. It creates a new input directory and in that directory is where
you select your joysticks, either non usb and usb, and other input
devices. Give it a try and let me know the results. The patch is to big to
post here is its at the following website:

Thank you.
Q: Why did they deprecate a.out support in linux?
A: Because a nasty coff is bad for your elf.
