I'm not sure if the example program does the Right Thing(TM).
It uses alarm 2 times; if I recall correctly, alarm gives an signal after
*AT LEAST* the amount specified.
So - the first call falls between 2 jiffies, and gets possible 1.xx seconds, while 
the second comes close enough to a jiffie-jump (recall the just completed alarm?)
to get more or less *exactly* 1 second.
Maybe time should be measured with gettimeofday() or the TSC?
Regards,
Phil
