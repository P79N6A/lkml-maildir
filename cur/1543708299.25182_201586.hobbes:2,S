I think this is the right place to ask it for, sorry if not.
I heard a few about future OpenGL implementation in the Linux kernel, 
but failed to find any resource on this question. I also remember a 
message from this list about its author's experiments with Mesa in this 
key..
Does anybody work on the subject now? Could you help me with (if there 
are any) some links or just explain what's this really about?
With best regards, Dmitry M. Shatrov
