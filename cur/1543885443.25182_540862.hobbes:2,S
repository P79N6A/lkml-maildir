One could argue that this can be tackled in userspace by SIGSTOPping all
such real-time threads before hotplugging CPUs and SIGCONTing them after
hotplug is complete.
Would this simple solution be acceptable?
Otherwise, we need to have:
1.  __stop_machine_run() set the priority/policy of the first kthread
   (do_stop) to MAX_RT_PRIO-1/SCHED_FIFO *before* waking it up
2. scheduler gives some API to add a thread to /front/ of runqueue
   (enqueue_task_head is internal to sched.c) and use that API in
   activating all stop_machine related threads.
