   these two issues with the nicstar have annoyed for some time now.  i
   have a powerpc platform and the +=KERNELBASE doenst work/make sense.
   pci_resource_start() should take care of this if necessary.  the
   second gripe, when atm_charge() fails, you need to count the pdu you
   are about to drop.
Patch applied, thanks Chas.
