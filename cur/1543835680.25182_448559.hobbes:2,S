It doesn't work like this, sorry. The merge window for 2.6.18 is
closed. The driver needs to be reviewed before it is merged. So the
best you can hope for is -mm soon, and 2.6.19.

Indeed, this is no good. If you want things to improve, please help by
reviewing Komal's driver. I think I understand you already commented on
it, but I'd like you to really review it, and add a formal approval to
it (e.g. Signed-off-by or Acked-by). Then I'll review it for merge.

Neither dropped nor rejected, as I received it and it shows in the
archive as well:
  
http://lists.lm-sensors.org/pipermail/lm-sensors/2005-August/013216.html
The reason why it was "ignored" is more likely a lack of time and/or
interest.
What is the relation between your "old" driver and the new one Komal is
submitting now? Evolution, or rewrite?
