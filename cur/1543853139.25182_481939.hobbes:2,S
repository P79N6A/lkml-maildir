This is because I got myself confused when writing that sentence
(minutes ago I was sending a patch for the appletouch driver, targeted
at the input tree).
I do believe that the proper place for ams is the hardware monitoring
section (even if the missing HD parking APIs makes it not very useful
right now).
The fact that the accelerometer offers a (low res) joystick emulation is
only a nice hack and I'm not even sure somebody (except Johannes) will
find an use for it.
