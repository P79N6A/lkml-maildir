Hi,
I'm creating a cache with kmem_cache_create and then allocating some objects with kmem_cache_alloc(). When I check the object count for my cache in /proc/slabinfo I always get the maximum number of objects for the number of slabs reserved. That is: For a cache for 64 byte objects, I reserve 20 objects and get an object count of 59.  If I reserve 30 objects I get the same object count. When I get to 70 objects the object count gets to 118. 
I have checked mm/slab.c and apparently the inuse counter in the slab gets incremented only once in kmem_cache_alloc_tail(). 
Someone can tell me why is this happening? Is there any documentation on kmem_cache structures?
Thanks,
	Miguel Catalina
