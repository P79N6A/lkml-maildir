Hans,
We talked at LWE '99 about this issue.
As you can see that this is getting to be a bigger mess as I predicted
more than a year ago.  As you explained to me that IGEL had verbal terms
of agreement that the code returned to M-Systems was returned with a GPL
license in it placed by IGEL.  M-Systems then remove the GPL license and
converted the code in to an object that violated the rules and spirit of
GPL.
Since I discussed the with with Tim Ney and RMS at LWE '99, did IGEL
followup with legal docs to protect your position.
Cheers,
