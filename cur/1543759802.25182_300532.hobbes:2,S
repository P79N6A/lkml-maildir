Unfortunately acrypto patch is more than 200kb, so neither mail list 
will accept it, so I've sent it in such form :)
Actually the most interesting is the first e-mail with subject line
"[0/many] Acrypto - asynchronous crypto layer for linux kernel 2.6" which 
has description of the acrypto layer and it's features.
Acrypto patches itself live in patches with prefix "acrypto" 
[it is from 1 to 21].
bd lives in the last five patches.
Several first e-mails without first number ([??/many]...) are 
various descriptions.
E-mail with subject line 
"[??/many] list of files to be sent in a next couple of e-mails with small description"
contains small one line description of each e-mail.
Sorry for such form, but it is really big set of information pieces, 
so I combined it in a such way.
