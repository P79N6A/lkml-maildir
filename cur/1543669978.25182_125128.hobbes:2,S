No, udev doesn't care about routing changes.  But there isn't enough
hardcoded logic in it to care about the different subsystems, so it
wants to figure out that it shouldn't care about an event all on its
own.

change that to "all" as no one better create a subsystem or driver class
in the kernel called "all" :)
