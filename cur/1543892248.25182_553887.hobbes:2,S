This one died a horrid death at boot time - console log indicates it found the
hard drive OK, found the 2 partitions on it.  But when the initrd ran a
'lvm vgscan', it didn't find the LVM2 space on /dev/sda2, so it panic'ed when
it fell off the end of the initrd because the root= wasn't there.
My first guess for blame:
gregkh-driver-sysfs-allocate-inode-number-using-ida.patch
as that's awfully similar to gregkh-driver-sysfs-fix-i_ino-handling-in-sysfs.patch
that broke 'lvm vgscan' for me in the same way on 21-rc7-mm[12].
I'll hopefully get a chance to revert that one and test later today - a quick
'patch -p1 -R --dry-run' shows a number of conflicts that will need hand-fixing
at the very least.
