In late 2.2.x we have sync_page_buffers too but I'm not sure how well it
behaves when the whole MM is costantly kept totally dirty and we don't have
swap. Infact also the 2.4.x implementation:
static void sync_page_buffers(struct buffer_head *bh, int wait)
{
	struct buffer_head * tmp = bh;
	do {
		struct buffer_head *p = tmp;
		tmp = tmp->b_this_page;
		if (buffer_locked(p)) {
			if (wait > 1)
				__wait_on_buffer(p);
		} else if (buffer_dirty(p))
			ll_rw_block(WRITE, 1, &p);
	} while (tmp != bh);
}
won't cope with the memory totally dirty. It will make the buffer from dirty to
locked then it will wait I/O completion at the second pass, but it
won't try again to free the page for the third time (when the page is finally
freeable):
	if (wait) {
		sync_page_buffers(bh, wait);
		/* We waited synchronously, so we can free the buffers. */
		if (wait > 1 && !loop) {
			loop = 1;
			goto cleaned_buffers_try_again;
		}
Probably not a big deal.
The real point is that even if try_to_free_buffers will deal perfectly with the
VM totally dirty we'll end waiting I/O completion in the wrong place.
setiathome will end waiting I/O completion instead of `cp`. It's not setiathome
but `cp` that should do write throttling. And `cp` will block again very soon
even if setiathome blocks too. The whole point is that the write throttling
must happen in balance_dirty(), _not_ in sync_page_buffers().
Infact from 2.2.19pre2 there's a wait_io per-bh bitflag that remembers when a
dirty bh is very old and it doesn't get flushed away automatically (from
either kupdate or kflushd). So we don't block in sync_page_buffers until it's
necessary to avoid hurting non-IO apps when I/O is going on.

Yes I seen, people overwriting dirty data was blocking too, that was
not necessary, but they were still writers.

Right way to avoid blocking with lock helds is to replace mark_buffer_dirty
with __mark_buffer_dirty() and to call balance_dirty() later when the locks are
released.  That's why it's exported to modules.  Everybody is always been
allowed to optimize away the mark_buffer_dirty(), it's just that nobody did
that yet. I think it's useful to keep providing an interface that does the
write throttling automatically.
