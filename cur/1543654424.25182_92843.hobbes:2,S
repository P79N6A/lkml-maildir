As someone who worries about IPC latency (more than speed) I think these
are useful numbers, if only to give some suggestions to kernel developers
who want to get the last bit out and will take them as a challenge. 
The VM stuff in 2.5 is slightly slower, not much to be done there,
hopefully in the real world balanced by more stable performance under
heavy load.
