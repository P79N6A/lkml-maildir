I would argue the same that the size of a buffer should never be able 
to be negative and the structure says this but the rest of the code 
does not. (Theoretically) if a negative size was asked for, then we'd 
actually try to allocate a large amount of memory for the buffer, 
possibly causing badness somewhere along the line.
Any maybe we shouldn't make it too hard for archs with 2GB pages :) 
It'll probably happen in 20 years. :)
