Subject: [patch] consolidate PREEMPT options into kernel/Kconfig.preempt
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/5/24/98

any objections? This is against the tail of the scheduler-patchset in 
-mm. For now i only included architectures that support the full range 
of preemption features - other architectures can still cherry-pick them 
if they want to. (I did not do a Kconfig.sched, because other scheduler 
features are much more hardware-dependent.)
--
this patch consolidates the CONFIG_PREEMPT and CONFIG_PREEMPT_BKL 
preemption options into kernel/Kconfig.preempt. This, besides reducing 
source-code, also enables more centralized tweaking of preemption 
related options.
