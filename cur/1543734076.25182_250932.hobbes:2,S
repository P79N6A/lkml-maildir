Its only problematic for the command line users. The GUI doesn't have
some mysterious notion of meta-characters, it provides out of band
information on boundaries.

See I don't care if you tinker with reiser4. I don't care if it turns
out to be a crap fs or a great fs. If its a great fs and scales and
unlike reiser3 can recover well from disk errors then one year I might
even use it.
I do care if you ask me to suffer core API changes for your research,
that in your economics world is an externality. Its a large negative
externality on the part of the userbase so the userbase objects. It
doesn't take a PhD in economics to understand this.
