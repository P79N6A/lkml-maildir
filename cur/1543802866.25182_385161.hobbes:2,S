DKDY has been a steady day trade all week. Each day coming from a low close
and climbing upwards of 40 Cents. Our reports show that a number of our members 
were able to watch closely and take a tidy profit for the day.
We believe this will continue tomorrow as we see another low entry opportunity
with high rises in the morning to be taken advantage of. DKDY's recent announcement
of projected profit increases of $3.4 Million has beena major part of this Day
trading trend.
Once again we recomend you get in on DKDY first thing in the morning and ride the 
daily climb and take adavantage of the price increase.
