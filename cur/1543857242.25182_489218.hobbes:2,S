The MIPS version of i8259 is already sharable that is all the code that
doesn't immediately deal with the i8259 PIC has been removed.  A few
small things will need still need attention.  i386 uses this silly
optimization in cached_master_mask / cached_slave_mask that depends on
little endian byte order.  i386 programs ICW2 with 0x20 while MIPS uses
I8259A_IRQ_BASE.  And the i386 version has various stuff such as the FPU
interrupt handler which are not immediately i8259A-related in i8259.c.
