Only user of sys_indirect?  There will be quite a few right away.
Every syscall that returns a file descriptor needs O_CLOEXEC support
(socket, pipe, epoll_create, ...)

No.  mmap calls create individual VMAs which gets expensive.  There
are also some hardware drivers which get more expensive the more VMAs
there are.  I want to go away as much as possible from mmap for
malloc.
