 Not on the i386 family.  Once an NMI is accepted by the CPU, it gets
internally masked until an iret instruction gets executed.  If another NMI
happens maenwhile, it's latched by the processor internally and dispatched
as soon as NMIs are unmasked.  Further NMIs received when masked are lost. 
 Check datasheets for details.
