Hi Sven.
Do you have gdth HW for testing patches?
I'm anticipating more scsi-ml changes in that regard in near future and would like
a more permanent solution for gdth. Could you please try below patch in place of
your patch and see if it works.
Thanks in advance
James Hi
do you think we should keep Sven's patch for the rc-fixes and my solution
for the next kernel? For the reason that my patch might be theoretically dangerous 
in regard to locking, queue-life-time, and such side effects?
Boaz

Subject: [PATCH] gdth: Use scsi_get_command for gdth internal commands
As found by: Sven Schnelle <svens@bitebene.org>
NULL pointer dereference bug during execution of Internal commands,
where gdth only allocates scp, but not scp->sense_buffer. The rest of
the code assumes that sense_buffer is allocated, which leads to a kernel
oops e.g. on reboot (during cache flush).
Fix this by leting scsi-ml allocate the command for us, in anticipation
of future changes to commands allocation.
