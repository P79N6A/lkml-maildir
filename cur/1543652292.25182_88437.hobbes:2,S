The feature is both buggy (both false consolidation and failure
to consolidate) and slow. While I do eventually need to add the
feature, I'm not doing so until it can be implemented properly.
So go ahead and enjoy procps-3.1.0 without it:
http://procps.sf.net/
Future-compatibility exists. The "m" and "-m" options are currently
ignored so that you may use them in scripts without causing errors.
Um, BTW, don't we need /proc/42/threads/123/stat and friends
before the Linux 2.6.xx release? Without them, the new clone
flags supposedly let a user hide a task. That's really bad.

Not that procps will ever be fast, but 3.1.0 is a lot faster
than 2.x.xx is. Five out of the last seven releases have
included performance improvements, and more are coming.
You also get IO-wait info in vmstat. Upgrade today! :-)
