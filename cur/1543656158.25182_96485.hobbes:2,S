That's what I expected!

Yup, it's compiled for SMP -- or, at least, I selected that option in make
menuconfig... ;) The boot reports:
Dec 15 11:51:18 Tycho kernel: Linux version 2.5.51 (root@Tycho)
                (gcc version 2.95.4 20011002 (Debian prerelease))
                #11 SMP Sat Dec 14 21:40:42 EST 2002
But later in the boot, it also states:
Dec 15 11:51:18 Tycho kernel: SMP motherboard not detected.
Something just doesn't look right about this.
