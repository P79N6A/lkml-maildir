Just switched to 2.6.3 and I can report that this misbehavior is still
there. Not quite as frequent as before (just a feeling). There seems
to be another failure mode introduced now. At time it just freezes for
about 1-3 seconds. I.e. The mouse just don't respond to anything. The
crazy movements are the more common failure mode though.
Anyone else recognize this? I get the infamous "psmouse.c: Wheel Mouse
at isa0060/serio1/input0 lost synchronization, throwing 1 bytes away."
thing still...
suggestions are welcome...
