I wonder if that is useful, can you see cases where it would be?
I mean, all it does is provide a default handler for places that don't have
one. All this is info drivers already have, if a driver chooses to implement
it's resume handler I think they can do better than this (and thus don't
need this helper). But... if you can come up with a reasonable use I don't
oppose it. I do like to see a sane user first though before adding this to
the driver API...
