Thanks for the further info, Brian.  Okay, the hugepage end of it does
add a different kind of complexity, in an area already complex from the
different arch implementations.  If you've found that a significant part
of the hugepage test improvment is actually due to the smallpage changes,
let's turn around what I said, and suggest Dave concentrate on getting the
smallpage changes right, putting the hugepage part of it on the backburner
at least for now (or if he's particularly keen still to present it, as 3/3).
