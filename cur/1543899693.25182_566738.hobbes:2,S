That's a good question :-) IIRC the serial PNP code used to mess up
the mode of the port on my laptop, making it useless for debugging the
boot. Bug was fixed long ago, but I didn't re-enabled that option.

Well for me it's a non-issue, I'm able to "work-around" it in many
ways. My point is that a configuration that used to work and is still
valid suddenly doesn't work anymore. I missed the dependacy on
CONFIG_EMBEDDED though, so feel free to ignore the patch ;-)
