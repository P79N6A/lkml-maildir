I'm still seeing my mystery-crash that I had since 2.6.24-rc3-mm2.
The crashed kernel was 2.6.24-rc8-mm1 with the following patches:
* personal fix for the "do_md_run returned -22"-problem
I'm just moving the analyze_sbs(mddev); above the test.
* git-sched-fix-bug_on.patch
* hotfix-libata-scsi-corruption.patch
The crash (captured via serial console):

The cursor on the receiving machine stayed after the : in the last
line, the crashed machine blinked caps lock and scroll lock.
I don't have a clue what the syslog-ng error is about or why this line
is one hour to early.
At 20:40 this kernel wasn't even build yet and syslog-ng started with
the correct timezone:
Jan 25 21:26:26 treogen syslog-ng[4839]: syslog-ng starting up; version='2.0.6'
As I'm seeing this bug during times of both network and hard disk
activity, could this be related to the problem discussed in the thread
"[PATCH rc8-mm1] hotfix libata-scsi corruption"? The line fixed in the
mm-hotfix seems to be to new to cause this in -rc3-mm2, but these
alignment problems seem to touch more than this and I'm not clear one
how old this might be.
(If this matters: The crashing system is running the smartd daemon
from smartmontools version 5.37)
I hope I will have time to try git-misc-tree on sunday...
