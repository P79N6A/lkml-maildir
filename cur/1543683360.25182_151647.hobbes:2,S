You'll probably get a barrage of replies...
You want udev + namedev, userspace naming policy.  See the recent
udev announcements from Greg Kroah-Hartman.
udev/namedev use sysfs device tree info to apply device naming policy.
From Greg's version 0.2 announcement:

kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-0.2.tar.gz
There's a BitKeeper tree of the latest stuff available at:
	bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/udev/
I've also placed the slides from my OLS talk up at:
	
http://www.kroah.com/linux/talks/ols_2003_udev_talk/
The paper which attempts to explain the background of udev, what it
does, and where it is going is at:

There's more in the announcment email.  This is still early code,
so there's much more to be done on it, but the demo yesterday looked
very good.
