Subject: When & how is the SCSI strategy routine called?

Hi list,
Tracing the kernel 2.6.8 code I found that scsi_mod maintains separate
request queues for each SCSI device. It uses the block layer queuing
facility to do this. What I could not find out was that once a request is
queued into a queue (for a particular device), WHEN and HOW is the strategy
routine "scsi_request_fn()" called ?
All I could find on the net was that "The kernel calls the strategy routine
when ever it believes that it is appropriate to invoke it."
Please help ... Any pointers will be highly appreciated.
TIA,
Rajat
