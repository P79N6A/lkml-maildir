Neither APM nor ACPI are answers to the power management problem.  Doing
power management in the kernel, without running bios code or anything and
having cross-architecture drivers is.

When you use rdtsc in user code, you basically do:
do {
	start = rdtsc();
	<some code>
	stop = rdtsc();
} while((stop - start) > HIGH_VALUE);
to ensure you were not interrupted so you get exact timing.
Now when you'd use a fake rdtsc value, you'd basically sacrifice any debugging
use of rdtsc for the very limited exact time case.

On Alpha at least, the cycle counters of two CPUs do not run synchronously,
so yes.  I don't know about any systems with different CPU speeds, but we
should not make it harder to use them if they exist.
