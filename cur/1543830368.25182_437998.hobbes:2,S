Look up thread.  You replied to the message where I commented on it.
There are two ways to argue this.
- It is the linux kernel development style to do small simple
  obviously patches that copy the maintainer of the code you are
  changing.
- Explain why that is the style.
The basic idea is that on a simple patch that is well described, it is
trivial to check and trivial to verify.
