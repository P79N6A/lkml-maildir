That's a thought, but not the case in my situation. The CD I'm using is the
RedHat distribution CD, which works fine under 2.2.12.
I have done some digging, and it appears that drivers/block/ide.c was changed
quite a bit between 2.2.12 and 2.2.14; it is this module that seems to be
logging the bulk of the errors. It is also interesting to note a comment in the
2.2.12 version (ide.c version 6.18) that says "need something here for HX PIIX3
UDMA and HPT343....AMH" followed by one of the several lines of error text from
my dmesg exactly ("irq timeout: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete
DataRequest }").
In the 2.2.14 (ide.c 6.19), this comment has been removed and replaced with
quite a bit more code, including the logging of the "irq timeout" message.
I have a PIIX4 and a "hdc: PLEXTOR CD-R PX-W8432T, ATAPI CDROM drive" a.k.a.
"hdc: ATAPI 32X CD-ROM CD-R/RW drive, 4096kB Cache" (as reported at bootup).
If it's any consolation, I'm running a "hdc: CREATIVE CD5230E, ATAPI CDROM
drive" a.k.a. "hdc: ATAPI 52X CD-ROM drive, 128kB Cache" with a PIIX4 on a
single CPU Asus mobo under 2.2.14 which works fine.
