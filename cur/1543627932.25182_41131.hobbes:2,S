  Unless they changed the laws of physics, the power in is the same as the
power out, and the temp will rise to increase power out (or limit power in
by melting). The power of the output driver lines is really too small to
consider.

1. learn physics
2. learn vocabulary
3. learn diplomacy
  Since he has problems running, when there's no question of power being
adequate, rather than while booting, I think looking for the real problem
is now in order. There have been several constructive suggestions on this,
which address the problem.
