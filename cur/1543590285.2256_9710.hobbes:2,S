We know that dirty swap pages can accumulate to the point where the
swapper starves before it gets to enough of the "second pass" cases of
the page_launder loop to run in order to get rid of them.
That was the behavior I saw that let me to hacking up my broken patch.
Even simple "memory hog" test programs can trigger this behavior.
Just write a program which "grows almost completely into swap then
subsides" over and over again.
