Solaris can keep their security holes.
Consider a setuid core dump on removable media which
is user-controlled.
Also consider filesystems that don't store full security
data, like vfat and smb/cifs.
Core dumps to remote filesystems are a problem in
general, because the server might not implement the
type of security you expect it to implement.
Here's a better idea: add a sysctl for insecure core
dumps. When set, dump all cores as root.root mode 444.
Ignore directory permissions when doing so, so that
forcing dumps into a MacOS-style /cores directory does
not require that users be able to access it normally.
This lets appropriately authorized users debug setuid
apps and get support for them without adding security
holes like Solaris has.
