I was puzzled by all this talk of problems with coax, but now I
understand.  My hit rate with *factory-built* coax cables is 100% so far.
I haven't yet seen a BNC connector that I'd risk using if I had to
assemble it myself.  (Now if they made *solderable* BNC plugs....)
I trust those big hunks of shiny nickelplated metal much more than the
sleazy plastic RJ45s.  But to each his own.  They both have their places.

Innovation is only valuable if it improves one's life; otherwise it's
just one more silly change to cope with.
