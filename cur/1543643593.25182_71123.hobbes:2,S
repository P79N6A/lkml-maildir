Nevertheless, the existence of a case where it's not sensible to use a 
debugger does not prove the non-existence of cases where it _is_ sensible 
to use a debugger. 
A case that happened to me recently -- tail-call optimisations screwed up
the return value of a function somewhere deep in the routing code. Adding a
printk made the problem go away. Staring at the C code was also of no use --
the C code was just fine.
Now, are you seriously suggesting that instead of using GDB to work out WTF 
was going on I should have spent three weeks starting at the output of 
'objdump -d vmlinux' ?
While my balls are big enough and hairy enough that I don't need to use GDB
to debug my own code, I feel no shame in admitting that I'm so much of a
pussy I can't deal with the above case without GDB.
