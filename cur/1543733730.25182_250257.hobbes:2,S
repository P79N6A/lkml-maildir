i disagree. It's the same as the VFS model: we have generic_block_bmap()
which a filesystem might or might not make use of. It's still around
even if no filesystem makes use of it but do we care? I'd prefer fixing
our linking logic to get rid of unused functions than complicating code
and the architecture with conditionals.
is there any architecture that cannot make use of kernel/hardirq.c _at
all_?
