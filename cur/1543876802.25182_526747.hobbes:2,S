We already have device drivers for physical devices that can be attached
to different buses. The EHCI USB is an example of a driver that can 
be for instance PCI, OF or an on-chip device. Moreover, you can have an
abstracted device behind it that does not need to know about the transport,
like the SCSI disk driver does not care if it is talking to an ATA, 
parallel SCSI or SAS chip, or even which controller that is.

console is also the least problematic interface, you can do it over
practically anything.

Doing a SCSI driver has been tried before, with ibmvscsi. Not good.
The interesting question about block devices is how to handle concurrency
and interrupt mitigation. An efficient interface should
- have asynchronous notification, not sleep until the transfer is complete
- allow multiple blocks to be in flight simultaneously, so the host can
  reorder the requests if it is smart enough
- give only a single interrupt when multiple transfers have completed
minor optimizations could be
- give an interrupt early when some transfers are complete
- allow I/O barriers to be inserted in the stream
- allow marking blocks as more or less important (readahead vs. read)
- provide passthrough of SG_IO or similar for optical media
  (e.g. DVD writer)

One way to do networking would be to simply provide a shared memory area
that everyone can write to, then use a ring buffer and atomic operations
to synchronize between the guests, and a method to send interrupts to the
others for flow control.
