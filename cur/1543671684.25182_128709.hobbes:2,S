I finally got a bit of time this morning, so I have now updated
my patch set.  I check very carefully and made sure I generated
my ALSA 0.9.2 patch from the correct kernel tree this time, so 
it actually contains my 0.9.2 port this time.

Sorry about having the wrong alsa patch in there last time.  Last
time around I has accidentlly built my alsa patch from my older
alsa kernel tree.  I have this built into my kernel and I now see 
    Partition check:
     hda: hda1 hda2
    Advanced Linux Sound Architecture Driver Version 0.9.2.
    PCI: Setting latency timer of device 00:11.5 to 64
    ALSA device list:
      #0: VIA 8233 at 0xcc00, irq 5
on bootup and xmms is playing.  Hope this is helpful,
 -Erik
