The following hack worked:
if (ret) {
        printk("~~~~~ .%s.%d.%s. ~~~~~\n", name, ret, kparam->name);
        for (;;)
                cpu_relax();
}
So I just hung my testbox at the point the info I wanted was printed out :-)
I hand-copied the following from the screen:
*****

allocated.
The kobject at, or inside cpu_devices+0x10/0xe0 is not dynamically

Something wrong with "cpu_devices" and "mtrr.show" in 22-mm1 me thinks.
Wonder if latest -git is already fixed? Spent 4 hours on this, at least :-p
BTW "kobject at, or inside cpu_devices+0x10/0xe0 is not dynamically
allocated" sounds like something that could, and should, have been
caught at build time ...
