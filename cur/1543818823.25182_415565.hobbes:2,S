When I had a working x86_64 that didn't use 2 contiguous pages there
were no other users left of non-0 order allocations, so I thought it
would be better to remove the unused code than to keep it.
But you probably have some unmerged code that depends on that functionality.

I will. But first - questions:
Should KEXEC_CONTROL_CODE_SIZE be left in even if it's always 4096?
Do you like how I added image->arch_private?

I argue that it is quite pointless to have code to support N-order
allocations that no one is using. Especially since the code is more
complex and it may be harder for the buddy allocator to fulfill
N-order allocations compared to 0-order allocations.
And on top of the reasons above I'd like to stay away from N-order
allocations because Xen doesn't guarantee that (pseudo-)physical pages
handled out by the buddy allocator are contiguous.

Oh. So if someone is working on kexec for alpha I guess we need
N-order allocations, right?
Thanks for your comments!
