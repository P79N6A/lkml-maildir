That's from max(A, max(B, C)) and max is defined as:
#define max(x,y) ({ \
        typeof(x) _x = (x);     \
        typeof(y) _y = (y);     \
        (void) (&_x == &_y);            \
        _x > _y ? _x : _y; })
Don't know how to fix it without making the code look uglier...

That's fixed in another patch.
