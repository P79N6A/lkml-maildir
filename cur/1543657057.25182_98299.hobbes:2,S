Subject: [PATCH]  Fix socket.c compilation failure when CONFIG_NET=n
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

In net/socket.c, <linux/wireless.h> is included twice, once conditionally
(on CONFIG_NET_RADIO || CONFIG_NET_PCMCIA_RADIO) and once unconditionally.
However, including <linux/wireless.h> defines WIRELESS_EXT, and this causes an
#ifdef in `sock_ioctl' to reference `dev_ioctl', which isn't defined when
CONFIG_NET=n, and so results in an unresolved symbol reference in that case.
The following patch fixes this by removing the unconditional include, and only
keeping the conditional one.
