Well, there are FAQs on the matter but.....
Check the process limit in bash. Do you have a limit set?
(Hint: ulimit -a to check all limits in bash).
I assume you don't.
Thus, you're running out of user processes. The max defined by default is
512 in include/linux/tasks.h (limited to 250 or so per user). What you
then must do is edit tasks.h and change this default. However, the max
that can be defined for x86 on linux is 4092 (4090 if you have APM
compiled in). Thus, change this number, and recompile the kernel.
However, this leads me to an interesting question of the list: What is the
maximum number of processes available on other architectures?
