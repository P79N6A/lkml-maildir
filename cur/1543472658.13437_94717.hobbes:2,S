And it's often true for servers as well, during peak load or when
somebody's doing something unusually memory-intensive and others aren't
doing much.
And it can always turn itself off when it's not helpful.

That's my plan---or in the short term, implementing enough of it
to show the performance issues convincingly.
Any assistance would be welcome, of course, whether it's helping

things to *avoid* messing with because they're carefully put together
and I'll mess them up.
