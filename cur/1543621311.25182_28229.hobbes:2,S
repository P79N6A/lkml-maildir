Dear folks,
I have tried cmd649 ATA pci cards; they work great with single CPU
kernels, not at all with SMP kernels.  The SMP kernel just does not make
an entry in /proc/ide.  Some details are in my post on 13 Feb, with
subject: cmd649 ok 1 cpu, 2 cpus, not working.  I would appreciate any
pointers that may lead to getting them working.
So if this is not a common problem, does _anyone_ use ATA cards with SMP
boxes?  If so, which ones work?  HPT?
