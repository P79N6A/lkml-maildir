The PCI 3.0 specification has implementation notes that MMIO address
space for a device's MSI-X structure should be isolated so that the 
software system can set different page for controlling accesses to 
the MSI-X structure. The implementation of MSI patch requires the PCI
subsystem, not a device driver, to maintain full control of the MSI-X
table/MSI-X PBA and MMIO address space of the MSI-X table/MSI-X PBA. 
A device driver is prohibited from requesting the MMIO address space 
of the MSI-X table/MSI-X PBA. Otherwise, the PCI subsystem will fail 
enabling MSI-X on its hardware device when it calls the function 
pci_enable_msi().
