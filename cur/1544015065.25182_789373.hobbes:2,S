I agree that the kernel needs quite different inlining heuristics
than let's say a template heavy C++ program. I guess that is 
also where our trouble comes from -- gcc is more tuned for the
later. Perhaps because the C++ programmers are better at working
with the gcc developers?
But it's also not inconceivable that gcc adds a -fkernel-inlining or
similar that changes the parameters if we ask nicely. I suppose
actually such a parameter would be useful for far more programs
than the kernel.
