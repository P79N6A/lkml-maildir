The point of Alan and about everybody else is that this code does not
occur in practise. leal simply *is* faster, overall, even if the compiler
always chose leal over addl.

Modern gcc has indeed imrpoved a lot on this. It still does not decide the
use of lea vs. add based on functional units, though. As it is now, it
favours addl over leal in cases these are equivalent (leal does not clobber
cc), and uses leal in all other cases.
This is an overall win.

pgcc indeed tries to catch the most common AGI occurrences, a technique
only effective on pentiums, though (the problem on pentiumpro and above
is much less severe, and the code sequences to exploit that are totally
different).
