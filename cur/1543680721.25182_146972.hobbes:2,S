Reading the handcrafted log, yes, that's 'exactly' what I get ;-)
If prodded, I can do a transcription as well.

Haven't tried the 2.5.74, but plain 2.5.75 is where I crash.

Yes, writing this on a machine with CONFIG_IDE_TASK_IOCTL is not set,
CONFIG_IDE_TASKFILE_IO=y and CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_TCQ is not set.
Speaking of TASKFILE... I had some hope that it would fix at least a bit
of the regression in disk speed since 2.4.19-ac1+preempt (my yardstick,
excellent kernel). Doing a hdparm -tT /dev/hda on that kernel I get ca
123 MB/sec and 27 MB/sec. On this 2.5.75 I see 119 MB/sec and 22 MB/sec.
Here's hoping it can be cranked up before 2.6!
