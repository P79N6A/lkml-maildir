Yes.  This could be one source of error, where I compute  the offset
hypervisor_time - ktime_get(), but ktime_get() may drift with respect to
hypervisor time while using a periodic jiffies timebase.

OK.  Erm, but not in the sense that you always choose the xen/hpet/lapic
clocksource+clockevent together; there's no direct linkage between the
two kinds of device.  But there's the coupling where the clocksource is
always used to directly measure the clockevent's behaviour.

Assuming that the clocksource and the clockevent device have
close-enough timebases.

Right, but if the clocksource and the clockevent devices have a relative
drift, then using the clocksource to compute that we need a 500ns delay,
but the clockevent device ends delivering the oneshot event 750ns (or
250ns) later, then things are going to be locally upset, even if the
next time the clockevent oneshot is programmed it will take the
overshoot into account.  (Of course, you'd hope the drift would never
really be that bad, and 2^32 ns only gives you ~4s window to screw up).

Unexpected pauses during boot.  I think the real problem is that Xen
periodic timer events are not delivered unless the vcpu is actually
running (ie, they're specifically intended for timeslicing rather than
general periodic events).  Perhaps the real fix in this case is to just
remove the periodic feature flag.
