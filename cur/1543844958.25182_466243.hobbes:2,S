I don't think so.  There's *never* address subtraction, there's
sometimes 32 bit wrap (glibc uses this to effect subtraction, sure).
But there's no wrap here.
To test, I changed the following:
--- smpboot.c.~8~	2006-09-25 15:51:50.000000000 +1000
+++ smpboot.c	2006-09-25 16:00:36.000000000 +1000
@@ -926,8 +926,9 @@
 					      unsigned long per_cpu_off)

 	unsigned limit, flags;
+	extern char __per_cpu_end[];
 
-	limit = (1 << 20);
+	limit = PAGE_ALIGN((long)__per_cpu_end) >> PAGE_SHIFT;
 	flags = 0x8;		/* 4k granularity */
 
 	/* present read-write data segment */
Works fine...
Hope that clarifies!
Rusty.
