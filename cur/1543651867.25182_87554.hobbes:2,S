Hmm, I'm seeing weird stuff with 2.5.46 and make menuconfig:
[root@zuul lx2546]# make menuconfig
make[1]: `scripts/kconfig/mconf' is up to date.
make -f scripts/Makefile.build obj=scripts lxdialog
make -f scripts/Makefile.build obj=scripts/lxdialog
./scripts/kconfig/mconf arch/i386/Kconfig
[root@zuul lx2546]# echo $?
0
Huh?  It just exits.  So, ok, run strace:
[root@zuul lx2546]# strace ./scripts/kconfig/mconf arch/i386/Kconfig
It seems to do TCGETS ioctl on every file it opens and gets ENOTTY,
although it doesn't seem that this is necessarily a problem for it.
Any ideas what's going on?
I'm running redhat's 2.4.7-10 kernel (redhat 7.1) with its tools.
It seems to read all of drivers/block/paride/Kconfig 
(8192 + 4959 bytes == whole file) then it just quits?
[...bunch of strace output deleted...]
open("drivers/block/paride/Kconfig", O_RDONLY) = 17
brk(0x8089000)                          = 0x8089000
ioctl(17, TCGETS, 0xbffff350)           = -1 ENOTTY (Inappropriate ioctl for device)
read(17, "#\n# PARIDE configuration\n#\n# PAR"..., 8192) = 8192
brk(0x808a000)                          = 0x808a000
read(17, "herwise you\n\t  should answer M t"..., 8192) = 4959
brk(0x808b000)                          = 0x808b000
brk(0x808c000)                          = 0x808c000
read(17, "", 8192)                      = 0
ioctl(17, TCGETS, 0xbffff340)           = -1 ENOTTY (Inappropriate ioctl for device)
_exit(0)                                = ?
