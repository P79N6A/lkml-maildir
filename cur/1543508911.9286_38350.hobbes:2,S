Hi all
First I have to say sorry for posting some HTML formatted messages to
the list from my office off - please excuse me.
I mentioned the following problem two days ago and hope to get answer
next days.
I am using a SMP machine with twp PII-400 and 1GB RAM on it. The box
contains three 2940U2W and a 3c900 Vortex network adapter.
Operating system is SuSE Linux 6.1 with an upgraded kernel (2.2.10); we
are running normal network services (no kernel nfs for example, no
smb...).
Two things happen from time to time:
1. When we start writing files over nfs to the machine, which are
already exisiting, we get timeouts on the client.
2. In combination with that (writing/reading via nfs is done by oracle
database and omniback backup-software) we get a kernel oops.
Restarting the nfsserver changes the situation and we can write to the
filesystem via nfs without any timeouts. Next time we start writing
files without restarting the nfs before, we get the timeouts and oops.
The oops is rather long and I will attach it as a text file to this
message. The system is running very fine and fast except this timeouts
and oopses so I hope this might be uncritical.
Please help, Dietmar
