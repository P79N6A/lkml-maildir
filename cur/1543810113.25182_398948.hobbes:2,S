I'm fine if you call this regression. :-) 
The real problem is there could be some bugs hidden by ec_intr=0.
I'm pretty sure your 600X box has thermal related issue that is breaking
2nd S3 suspend. But I don't know how.
ec_intr=1 just get these bug  just exposed on your box, 
and we need to work together to fix them. 
Thanks,
