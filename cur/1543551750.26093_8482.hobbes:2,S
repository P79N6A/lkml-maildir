Probably completely unrelated, as the code in question shouldn't even
be getting executed on most 486's (due to lack of cpuid instruction)
And those that do have the instruction will return a value too low
to meet the condition.
People mentioned that various laptops don't work since test9.
I wouldn't be surprised if this was the same thing you're experiencing.
Feel free to prove me wrong by reversing the changes to setup.c in
test10pre though.
regards,
Dave.
