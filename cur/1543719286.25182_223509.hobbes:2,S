Hi,
is there any chance to get a fix for this :
ioctl32(tw_cli:5923): Unknown cmd fd(5) cmd(0000001f){00} arg(08189318) on /dev/twe0
(that's just the 'info' command in tw_cli)
looks like there is some missing ioctl32/64 conversions there... (I know tw_cli is proprietary 
but the ioctls are GPL ;)
or maybe 3ware people may provide a 64 bits compiled version of their tools ?
otherwise there is no way to use their admin tools at runtime 
(and so one needs to reboot the machine to go into their BIOS to tweak things)
Cheers,
Mik
