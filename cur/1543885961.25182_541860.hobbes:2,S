I've been noticing this off and on for the past week or so.
The system seems to jam up for several seconds, anything that would
need to read from disk just sits there during this time.  I think it's
correlated with generating a lot of dirty write data.
My mouse moves around in X etc. so it really is only processes that
need to read from disk that get stuck.
Perhaps it's a side effect of those dirty ratio changes Linus made to
start off the 2.6.22 merge cycle?
