What can I say?  If we could give 99.99999999% uptime my phone would still
start buzzing with angry users when any of our systems is down for 1
minute.  No matter how good your uptime is, downtime is still bad, and
reducing downtime is still good.
(Okay, I said "customer" and now I'm saying "user".  I keep forgetting
that, these days, the person who approves the contracts and requests the
checks may be totally unacquainted with the person who actually uses the
equipment.  :-P )

A Brazil-nut is neatly packaged and tightly integrated.  To turn it into
food, you must crack and remove the shell.  I find that I feel the same   
way about an increasing number of software products.  *sigh*
