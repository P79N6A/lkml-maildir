I must've glazed over something, I thought this was removal of slabs?
BTW, this will interact shared_kernel_pmd patch that Jeremy's posted a
few times (I know at least wli has looked over that one).  We need to
make sure that PAE under at least Xen hypervisor has a page-sized pgd,
although the mmlist chaining looks nice to me.

clone_pgd_range() for consistency?  and it seems we lost a paravirt_alloc_pd_clone()
in there somewhere.
