But your patch 2/2 doesn't use this interface, why not?

Hm, can you really use this?

I don't see how this would be any different from the original?  You are
always passed a kobject, which can be embedded in anything else.
Could you also modify the documentation and the sample code to use this
new field, showing how it is to be used, and testing that it works
properly at the same time?
