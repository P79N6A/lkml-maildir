Here is a report on my tests of 2.6.0-test1 on ThinkPad A30:
(preempt kernel with quite standard config - I'll post config on request)
- RadeonFB - sort-of works (it was working fine in 2.4.21). It boots, 
detects panel size correctly (1400x1050), switches to fbconsole of 
proper size but the screen is garbage: the contents of each line seams 
to be shifted by some 8-32 pixels (its difficult to tell exactly how 
much). I was able to reset it to proper geometry by "fbset 1600x1200-60" 
command (notice the geometry!) and after that it reports virtual 
resolution 1600x1200 and visable resolution of 1400x1050 and works fine.
- ACPI - I was unable to boot with ACPI turned on. It simply hangs at
very early stage (shows nothing on the console). Notice that this is 
upgraded BIOS/EC machine with corrected ACPI tables - 2.4.21-ac4 with 
ACPI works fine. Any sugestions?
- Other - i've noticed too fast playback in mplayer (by some 10-20%) and
jumping sound/video in xine.
- We will need to put some more documentation on setting this kernel up 
for newbies (I know - later).
The rest is working fine as far as I can tell.
I'll be happy to provide any additional info/conduct more tests. Just 
say so.
