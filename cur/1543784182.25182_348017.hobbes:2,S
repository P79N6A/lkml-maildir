Because of
static inline struct thread_info *current_thread_info(void)
{
        struct thread_info *ti;
        __asm__("andl %%esp,%0; ":"=r" (ti) : "" (~(THREAD_SIZE - 1)));
        return ti;
}
[include/asm-i386/thread_info.h]
which assumes that it can "round down" the stack pointer and then will
find the thread_info of the current context there. Only works for
identically sized stacks. Note that this function is heavily used in
the kernel, either directly or indirectly. You cannot avoid it.
My current assessment regarding differently sized threads for
ndiswrapper: not feasible with vanilla kernels.
