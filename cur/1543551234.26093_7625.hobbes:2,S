Hi,
I noticed, that the use count of module lp is increased
when a cron job is done but never decreased.
Same with restarting lprng.
So I tested this with a c-program, that opened /dev/lp,
closed /dev/lp and exited. After this, I started 'lsmod' 
and the usage of module lp was increased by 1.
My kernel is an XFS-patched 2.4.0test8 compiled on 
egcs2.91.66 for K7. Perhaps someone with an unpatched
kernel could tell me, if its the same ...
Thanks,
Ralf
