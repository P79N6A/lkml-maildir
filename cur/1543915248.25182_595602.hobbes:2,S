When the kernel sets up the context for a user-space signal
handler, it needs to supply a return address (in a register
or on the stack). That's the restorer. The restorer points
to a stub that performs sys_{rt_,}sigreturn(). Depending on
architecture and kernel version, the restorer stub can be
defined by libc, or be provided automatically by the kernel.
