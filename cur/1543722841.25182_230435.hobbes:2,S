The fix for those should be that they should all export the same HZ to 
user space, regardless of any internal tick. So that's a kernel bug, in 
that those architectures expose the _internal_ HZ rather than some 
user-visible well-defined one.

If the user space tools didn't try to deal with it, the architectures 
would probably get fixed in a jiffy. All the support for kernel-to-user HZ 
conversion is there.
So I still maintain that procps should _not_ try to guess HZ. As it is, 
it's a bug, and it helps make excuses for _other_ bugs.
