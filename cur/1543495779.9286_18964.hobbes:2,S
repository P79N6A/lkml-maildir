Hi all, (especially Andrea)
	I've been doing some more SPECWeb96 tests, and with Andrea's
patch to 2.2.8 (
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/andrea/kernel/2.2.8_andrea1.bz
)
**On identical hardware, I get web-performance nearly identical to Tru64!**
Previously, Linux response times had been 100ms while tru64 had been ~4ms. 
However, with this patch applied, linux reponse times almost mirror Tru64. 
Tru64	~4ms
2.2.5	~100ms
2.2.8 	~9ms
2.2.8_a ~4ms
I realize that 2.3.1 has a more efficient wakeone patch applied, and haven't
yet had a chance to try it.  (Maybe tonight)
Time spent in schedule has decreased, as shown by this Iprobe data:
2.2.8 (pure)

The number of SPECWeb96 MaxOps per second have jumped has well.
**Please, put the wakeone patch into the 2.2.X kernel if it isn't already. **
