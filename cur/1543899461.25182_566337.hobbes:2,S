Yeah, that sounds fine too.

Oh, absolutely. I wasn't implying that we would want to do it today, but 
as it is now, just looking at that code makes my eyes water.. So it would 
be nice to fix that up.
One reason I would almost prefer an "nd", though, is that it would allow 
us to in general always just convert anythign that now looks up a path to 
look up "a path or file descriptor" instead. Those things need "nd" right 
now, and if it's a "struct path", then you'll always have the two 
different cases, rather than just the common "release_nd()" at the end.
