After applying this patch it seems that "Linux" is supporting this
marker officially in general - especially if the kernel supports it. I
suppose the next kernel patch is to support Win-like CR-LF sequences
(which is not the case AFAIK).
BTW even some standards body thinks that this is the way to go, it
raises more problems and questions than resolves anything.

And though scripts are usually edited/changed/"parsed"/... with an text
editor, it is not always the case. Therefore the automatic extension to
*all text files* (especially as the marker basically applies to all text
files, not only scripts).
You want to focus just on your patch and ignore the directly implied
potential problems arising ...

`cat` as such will not break (as such).

Apparently I have to repeat: If you do `cat a.txt b.txt >c.txt` where
a.txt and b.txt have this marker, then c.txt have the marker of b.txt
somewhere in the middle. Does this make sense in anyway?
How do I get rid of the marker in the middle transparently?

It is different even if a pure ASCII file is marked as UTF-8.
And sure, the problem exists in general with multi-byte encodings.

It depends on the definition of "character". There are other standards
which define "character" as "byte".

It is not supported by the kernel. So either you remove it or you make
some compatibility hack (like an appropriate sym-link, etc.). Since the
kernel can start java classes directly, you can probably make a similar
thing for the UTF-8 stuff.
