That's not what happens though. We walk down the priorities, fail to
reclaim anything (in this case, move anything from active to inactive)
and the OOM killer fires. Perhaps the other pages being freed are
being stolen ... we're in direct reclaim here. we're meant to be
getting our own pages.
Why would we ever want distress to be based off a priority that's
higher than our current one? That's just silly.

We scanned 122,000 odd pages. Of which we skipped over over 100,000
of them because they were mapped, and we didn't think we had to try
very hard, because distress was 0.

Showed him a real trace of a production system blowing up?
Demonstrated that the current heuristics are broken?
That sort of thing.
