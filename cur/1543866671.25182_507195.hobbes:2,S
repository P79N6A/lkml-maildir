Subject: What will be in the x86-64/x86 2.6.21 merge
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I will post the existing patches in batches for closer review.
Can be already all viewed at 
ftp://ftp.firstfloor.org/pub/ak/x86_64/quilt/patches/
Highlights: 
- Using %fs instead of %gs for PDA register (Jeremy F.)
- Removed the old static rom probing on x86-64. We really trust e820 now.
  This is slightly experimental still. We'll see how it does.
- uncached copy user 
  Not a clear win, but also not a loss. Follow i386.
- Fix 32bit EFI with regparms.
- Fix boot slowdown as VT guest (Zach Amsden) 
- VMI for paravirtualized VMware 
  * first paravirt ops client
  * still some changes missing which need more work
- Various changes in APIC routing setup (Ingo Molnar)  
- Various changes in mmconfig handling (Olivier Galibert, OGAWA Hirofumi, me) 
  * Share code between i386/x86-64
  * Be more aggressive at ignoring bogus MCFG tables 
  * Now supports white lists for some chipsets (currently only Intel 945/915) 
- Some patches for the upcomming AMD Family10 CPUs.
- More init section reference fixes from Vivek
- Some preparation patches for Perfmon
- New NUMA hash function for x86-64 and related changes (Amul Shah) 
- Support a trigger on machine check events on x86-64
- NMI watchdog fixes for Core2 from Venkatesh
- Fix a HPET timer calibration issue on systems with long SMM events at boot (Jack Steiner)
- Fix compat a.out signals on x86-64 
- Lots of small stuff
Not included yet. Might or might not make .21:
- Solution for Nvidia IOMMU corruptions. We could default to iommu=soft for 
  nvidia, but I was still hoping for a workaround from the hardware vendors.
- vDSO support (still trouble with newer toolkits)  
- Xen paravirt ops support from Jeremy/Chris
- Dynamic command line from Bernhard Walle
- Fast getcpu from Dean (requires vDSO) 
- Rewritten RAID XOR functions 
- Fixes for empty nodes from mm
- Fake node improvements for x86-64
- New dynamic IRQ 0 probing to work around all chipset issues
- lguest
  * still seems heavily in development. Not sure it will be ready in time.
Not likely to make .21:
- PAT support (needs some more work and lot more testing) 
- Early firewire support for firescope at early boot
Full list of patches:
Note I will do at least a second review pass before sending them to Linus,
so there might be changes. No guarantee all patches will make it.
