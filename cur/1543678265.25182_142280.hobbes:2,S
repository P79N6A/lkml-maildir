I'd considered that and I'm reconsidering it again now. Not convinced 
which way to go... Putting something as large as struct request_queue 
within the nbd_device seems unbalanced somehow. Then again, until 2.5 
the request_queue was typically shared by multiple devices of the same 
MAJOR so part of the way the code is has to do with the legacy code. 
Like the nbd_lock spinlock array and the struct request_queue queue_lock 
field. Along the lines you're pushing for, why not have struct 
requests_queue's queue_lock field then be the spinlock itself instead of 
just being a pointer to a spinlock???

What's wrong with having an explicit cache of this value that we can 
rest assured doesn't in the worst case get compiled into multiple calls 
to the htonl code?? Possible waste of one 4 byte memory location in the 
worst compiler case or is there another problem?

Yeah. I'm a bit to attracted perhaps to zero filling things explicitly 
in my coding style. Sigh.

Historically, some code used MAJOR_NR this way (like the original nbd 
driver unfortunately), and I didn't change that. Seperating the header 
was something I'd thought about but in the end felt that just changing 
two existing files was bad enough without going off and adding a third 
or more files. It's worth reconsidering though also. Thanks!
