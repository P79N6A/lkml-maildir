Is there any pattern to the way it dies? Or is it just randomly dieing
somewhere depending on which config options you have enabled?
This is starting to sound reminiscent of a bug I chased for a while last
year on Power5, but didn't find. It was "fixed" on some machines by
disabling CONFIG_KEXEC, and/or other random unrelated CONFIG options.
Unfortunately it magically stopped reproducing so I never caught it :/
