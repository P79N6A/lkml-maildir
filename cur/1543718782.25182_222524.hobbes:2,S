IMO it is fine, as long as it works with IRQ disabled. There are archs 
where IRQ latencies matters more than lat_ctx times (that BTW are bogus). 
And we already have the infrastructure in place to let the arch to choose 
the way better fits it. Russel reported that a guy trying it (IRQ enabled 
ctx switch) with MIPS was having some problem with it though.
BTW, the unlock_irq should go in prepare not finish.
