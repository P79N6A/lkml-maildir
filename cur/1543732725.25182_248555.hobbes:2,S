the -mm kernel used to have additional *-latency-fix patches that were
done based on the initial preemption-timing patch in -mm and partly
based on early VP discussions and findings. I recently reviewed and
merged the 2-3 missing ones into VP. Andrew has dropped these patches
meanwhile and i expect to submit the cleaner and more complete solution
that is in VP.
So i'd expect -mm to still perform better than vanilla (it usually
does), but if that big 10% difference in latencies doesnt show up
anymore i'd attribute it to the shuffling around of latency related
patches, not some genuine deficiency in -mm.
