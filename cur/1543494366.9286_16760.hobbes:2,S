I'm working on an addition to ipchains to allow filtering on local UIDs -
allowing rules like 'Only EUIDs less than 1000 may make outgoing
connections to an SMTP server'. One thing has me beat:
Is there a sensible way of finding out at the ipchains filtering stage
what PID this packet is going to or coming from, so I can work out
it's EUID?
