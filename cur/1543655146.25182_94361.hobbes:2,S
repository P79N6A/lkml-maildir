I like to move vga.h to include/video. And yes I like to clean it up. The 
reason is I like to implement the function in vga.h and some in vgastate 
into vgacon.c. It would be nice if vgacon could support different hardware 
states per VC instead of changing every virtual console for everything. 
The other dream is I like to see vgacon become firmware independent.
