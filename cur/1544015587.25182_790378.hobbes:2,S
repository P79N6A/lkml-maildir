And would have brought a whole history of totally irrelevant stuff that
never exited for real, with probably a lot of non-compiling sub-steps
which would be even worse.
No, the two possible choices were to squash the whole stuff at once, or
do what has been done IMNSHO.  People have to grok how to take shortcuts
with git-bisect.  I know that git-bisect puts people on the brainless
course of actions where they git-bisect; configure; compile; boot; test;
mark as good/bad and retry.  And that's what I sometimes don't like with
it.  Because people trust git-bisect too much and forget how to think
right.
