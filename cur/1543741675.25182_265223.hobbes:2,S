another thing to watch for is the context-switch rate in vmstat. -V0.3
patches include a hack that include involuntary context-switches (mutex
context switches) in the context-switch stat as well. (previously those
were reported in a separate field which vmstat didnt pick up.)
So if the context-switch rate shots up to above say 100K/sec that is a
sure sign of some mutex badness. The livelock scenarios i solved in
-V0.3 occasionally generated a more than 500K/sec context-switch rate on
a 2GHz box. Having just a couple of thousand per sec isnt by itself a
sign of anything unusual.
