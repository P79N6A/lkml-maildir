Well, yes.  I have no idea why it causes a problem.  But other than
that, sched_clock does absolutely nothing which would affect lockdep state.

You dropped this patch, "Ignore stolen time in the softlockup watchdog"
because its presence triggers the lock tester errors.  The only thing
this patch does is use sched_clock() rather than jiffies to measure
lockup time.  It therefore appears, for some reason, that using
sched_clock() in the softlockup code is making the lock-test fail. 
Since the lock test doesn't explicitly do any softlockup stuff, the
connection must be implicit via sched_lock - but how, I can't imagine.
Since sched_clock() itself looks perfectly OK, and the softlockup
watchdog seems fine too, I can only conclude its a bug in the lock
testing stuff.  But I don't know what.
