For example, there are drivers that define .suspend() and .resume() which
do not work correctly and we can use the flag to mark them.

This is quite similar to what we are trying to do now: ask driver authors to
define .suspend that will return -ENOSYS if they can't ensure that the driver
will handle the suspend and resume correctly.

I think this convention is unfortunate.  The default should be to fail the
suspend if there's no .suspend defined, IMO.  Still, it's hard to change now.

I think there are many drivers without .suspend and .resume already in the
tree, so that wouldn't be practical.
