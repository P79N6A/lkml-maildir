This can be solved either by using module_param_call() in every module, 
and properly handling the "asynchronous" changes of module parameter, or 
by just disallowing the parameter from being tuned through sysfs 
completely (by setting the 'permissions' parameter of module_param() to 
zero ... which is what many drivers do anyway, I'd guess).
