So if a new pdflush is spawned, it get's moved to some cpuset? That
probably isn't something these realtime systems want to do (ie. the
non-realtime portion probably doesn't want to have any sort of scheduler
or even worry about cpusets at all).

No, not on your systems. I'm worried about the smaller ones that don't
get so much attention (eg. hard partitioning for realtime).
