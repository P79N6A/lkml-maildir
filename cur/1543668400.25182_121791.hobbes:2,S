Yes. I had it initially as Xavier suggested but after thinking about it
a bit I felt that making the value smaller and -then- bigger was safer.

It is still an unsigned long long int so (AFAIK) it wont overflow till
it hits 18,446,744,073,709,551,615. Now... if you have that much ram...
wow! :)
Basically it'll only overflow for astoundingly stupid values of size and
when it comes down to it, I think you could still make it overflow by
setting a REALLY large static value for size anyways (liek greater then
the above). Same issue as far as I can see.
