i686-linux-gcc (GCC) 4.2.0 20060410 (experimental)
         movl    $4, %ecx        #, tmp65
         cld
         movl    $v, %esi        #, tmp63
         movl    $.LC0, %edi     #, tmp64
         repz
         cmpsb
         sete    %al     #, tmp68
Still not perfect, but better already.  If you have any
specific examples that you'd like to have compiled to
better code, please report them in GCC bugzilla (with a
self-contained testcase, please).
