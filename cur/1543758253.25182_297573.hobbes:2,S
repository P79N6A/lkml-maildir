Hello list,
/* please, CC me since I'm on dialup and not subscribed to LKML anymore :(
*/
It seems nvidia is broken with latest kernels; in fact, the last kernel I
could use is 2.6.9-rc4-mm1-RT-U4.
With 2.6.11-rc4-RT-V0.7.39-02 modprobing nvidia goes without error but X
doesn't start, screen goes black and then it kicks back to the terminal. In
dmesg I see:
	NVRM: rm_init_adapter failed
I'm attaching .config, Xorg.0.log and dmesg.
Is this a know bug/problem with nvidia, or is there some option I'm missing
 in my config?
Thanks,
Norberto
