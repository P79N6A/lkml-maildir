Paulus and I identified a couple of cases in the page fault path. One typical is
the software accessed bit thing at the end of handle_pte_fault() where we cab
do
	entry = pte_mkyoung(entry);
	ptep_establish(vma, address, pte, entry);
	update_mmu_cache(vma, address, entry);
On a PTE that is present. That normally shouldn't happen as since the PTE is
present, we shouldn't have reached do_page_fault() in the first place, but
there is a window where that can happen, though that would be broken userspace
code.
Typically, you can have a thread faulting on a page. It goes through hash_page,
doesn't find the entry, and gets to do_page_fault(). However, just before it
takes the mm sem, another thread actually mmap's that page in. Thus we end up
in handle_pte_fault() with a present PTE which has a valid mapping already.
The risk here is that since we have a present PTE, we can at any time (another
thread/cpu ?) get it into the hash table. Our set_pte would then possibly replace
the PTE valid entry (with the same valid PTE entry) except that we lost the
HASH_PTE bit and hash index, thus we lose track of the one already in the hash
table in any. That mean we leave a dangling PTE in the hash, which is a very
bad thing.
I agree the race is very small and only possible with broken userland code I
suppose, but it could create all sort of bad things with the kernel, so it
needs to be fixed anyway. (It can panic on iSeries for example, or cause
undefined MMU behaviour).
There might be other similar cases where we set_pte a present PTE, that's
the one we have analyzed.
Ben.
