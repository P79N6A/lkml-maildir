And a stupid bug I missed.  Call sendfile with count>filesize and the
loop doesn't terminate.  Fixed patch below.

Linus and Andrew are rightfully concerned about local DoS via a large
file->file sendfile().  This patch turns large sendfile() calls into a
loop of 4k chunks.  After each chunk, it adds a cond_resched for
interactivity and a signal check to allow aborts etc. after the user
found out what a bad idea this may be.
