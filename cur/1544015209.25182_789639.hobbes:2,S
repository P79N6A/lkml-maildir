Yeah, true. Although one of the reasons inlining actually ends up causing 
problems is because of the bigger stack frames. That leaves a lot of space 
for old stale function pointers to peek through.
With denser stack frames, the stack dumps look better, even without an 
unwinder.

I thought -Os actually disabled the basic-block reordering, doesn't it?
And I thought it did that exactly because it generates bigger code and 
much worse I$ patterns (ie you have a lot of "conditional branch to other 
place and then unconditional branch back" instead of "conditional branch 
over the non-taken code".
Also, I think we've had about as much good luck with guessing 
"likely/unlikely" as we've had with "inline" ;)
Sadly, apart from some of the "never happens" error cases, the kernel 
doesn't tend to have lots of nice patterns. We have almost no loops (well, 
there are loops all over, but most of them we hopefully just loop over 
once or twice in any good situation), and few really predictable things.
Or rather, they can easily be very predictable under one particular load, 
and the totally the other way around under another ..
