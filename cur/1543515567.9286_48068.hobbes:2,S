Hi *, 
Today I wanted to install Linux on a computer which had Dynamic Drive 
Overlay installed. I wanted to wipe that thing because it leads into 
problems when using Win98 on it and it is not needed anymore with 
the operating systems we were going to use.
So I wrote a few nulled blocks to /dev/hda to wipe whatever originally 
was there. After installing Linux - big surprise: Ontrack survived that 
attack.
After reading genhd.c I learned that the disk driver remapped everything 
so that the first 64 blocks are inaccesible under Linux. I think we 
should add a possibility to switch that feature of at runtime in case 
somebody really wants to lose ontrack without getting the install disk 
again just for wiping it...
Thanks
    Torsten
