As far as Unicode is concerned we could go really wild here, e.g. how do 
we handle decomposed characters, there are also halfwidth characters...
So the primary question is still: is this a kernel problem? The kernel 
only implements a simple fixed char width output device. Does it really 
make sense to pretend being able to handle characters, we can't display 
in first place?

If everyone reimplements this kind of stuff, something is seriously 
wrong...
