devfs only drivers == EVIL. Pure EVIL.

use C99  .owner = THIS_MODULE
Ok, this is a 2.4 driver, but it makes forward porting simpler.
Also, the comments are pointless.

can be static (as can most other functions in this file)

1. Probably shouldn't be commented out.
2. Don't use check_region, just check return of request_region.

Something more userfriendly "mb8wdog: unloading\n" would be nicer.

KERN_DEBUG ? and STOP SHOUTING!
>	printk(KERN_INFO "MB800 WATCHDOG: ENTER CREATE DISPATCH\n");
in fact, these printk's should probably be something like dprintk's
with dprintk being defined at the top of source like..
#define DEBUG
#ifndef DEBUG
# define dprintk(format, args...)
#else
# define dprintk(format, args...) printk(KERN_DEBUG "mb8wdog:", ## args)
#endif

Please choose one indentation style, and stick to it.
Preferably the one described in Documenation/CodingStyle
	if (b) {
		EnableAndSetWatchdog(b);
	} else {
		DisableWatchdog();
	}
Other than these small nits, I don't see any problems with it.
The biggest issue is the devfs-only requirement, which as I mentioned,
is really evil, and afaics, totally unnecessary.
