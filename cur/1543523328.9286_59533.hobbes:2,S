   The reason knfsd refuses to touch a file with the mandatory locking bit
   on is that I wasn't sure how to deal with it. Blocking the server thread
   isn't an option.
I think Posix is pretty wishy-washy on this.  It's in the spec, but
clearly states Unixes don't have to implement it.  I forget what
we do in the face of mandatory locking, we may simply ignore the
lock.
Mandatory locking in a network environment opens you right up to
denial of service attacks.  Well, denial of shutdown attacks, at least.
I don't know any NFS devo who thinks mandatory locking is a good idea.
