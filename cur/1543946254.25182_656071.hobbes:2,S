Agree, however see the following sequence.
__generic_make_request call q->make_request_fn(q, bio);
It was set by blk_init_queue_node with __make_request.
There are two ways in __make_request.
Case 1, get_rq
Case 2, out or merged (otherwise you mean unplug case)
In case 1, if the BIO_RW_SYNC is set, the request gets the REQ_RW_SYNC
And REQ_RW_SYNC says 
"include/linux/blkdev.h":112: __REQ_RW_SYNC,          /* request is sync (O_DIRECT) */
It means it acts as O_DIRECT flag. Is it right?
And it also is same as case 2. Unplug the device.
So next time it hasn't chance to merge???
Is it right?
