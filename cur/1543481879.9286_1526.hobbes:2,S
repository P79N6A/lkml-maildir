I can't believe I missed the comment in the .sign files!  I thought I
had looked, but...I think I've been working too hard. :-(
However, maybe there could be a link to this page from the main
www.kernel.org page, maybe under the category of cryptographic
software?
Thanks for the pointer!  (And thank you to everyone who has pointed me
in the right direction!)  Sorry for the brain damage.
