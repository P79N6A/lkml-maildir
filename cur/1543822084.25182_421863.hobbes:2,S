Using get_cycles() for /dev/random is new as of 2.6. Before that, we
were directly calling rdtsc on x86 alone. 10msec resolution is fine
for plenty of sources.
From a brief glance, the following don't have a useful get_cycles:
v850, sh, sh64, h8300, m32r, arm, arm26, cris, frv, um, m68k, xtensa,
sparc
And several others like mips (and x86) have one on only some hardware.
