well no, as it happens, I have crashes with every 2.2 kernel so far. 
longest uptime has been 27 days.  I put it down to dodgy disks in the
quantums but...  Most commen cause of the crash is tar (backup script)
and e2fs error

I don't know... but I ran the box in single cpu mode for a while and it
crashed faster (ie lower uptimes)

yeah it logged the oops but running ksymoops over it brings up
garbage...

Ok.. detailed?? here we go
Mobo Asus PIIB-DS
     dual PII-266 (there arn't any dodgy PII's with bugs floating around
are there??)
     apart from the onboard adaptec there is the diamond fireport uses
the SYM53c875-J driver
if you want anything more than that.. I can include a dmesg output??
Cheers
Craig (really need a stable box and can't seem to get it :( )
