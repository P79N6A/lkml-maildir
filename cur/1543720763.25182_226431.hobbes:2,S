I agree this is the ideal fix.  I can see advantages and disadvantages
to all the approaches.  I'm not familiar with the locking issues, so I
can't comment on that.

These are design issues outside the scope of what I'm doing, but they
are important.  I'll try to keep these considerations in mind as I
continue to improve cqual.  Thanks for the helpful feedback.
