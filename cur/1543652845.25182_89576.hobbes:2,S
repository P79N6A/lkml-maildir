This is much of what I hoped to do with the Linux Quality Database:
http://linuxquality.sunsite.dk/
alas, the dot-com crash happened, and I've been struggling so hard to keep my 
little business afloat that I never had enough time to devote to it.  It's good 
to see that someone has set up a bug tracking system that will be a little more 
accessible to the public than a high-traffic mailing list.
I have some suggestions about how you could improve upon bugzilla to make the 
database more useful for kernel developers.  I mention them on the page above 
and in my comment in the slashdot discussion about the new bugbase:
http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=45108&cid=4675035
I didn't consider using bugzilla at first because it didn't have the 
capabilities of storing configuration info the way I wanted.  No bugbase I have 
ever used has done that, although I would consider it to be a very basic 
feature for a bug database for kernel bug tracking.  I'd meant to write a 
database app from scratch to do that, which was really more than I could 
handle.  More recently I'd been contemplating modifying bugzilla to do what I 
want, but these last few months have been really hectic.
Some have pointed out their desire for a vendor-neutral location for the bug 
database.  When I asked around about who could host it, some commercial 
companies offerred to, but I went with 
http://sunsite.dk/
 in large part because 
they were not part of any company.
The one thing I _have_ been able to do is write some articles on kernel quality 
in particular and software quality in general.  You'll find them here:
http://linuxquality.sunsite.dk/articles/
The OSDL has been kind enough to mirror the kernel testing articles as well as 
translate them into Japanese.  I encourage others to mirror or translate my 
articles - they are all published under the GNU Free Documentation License.
