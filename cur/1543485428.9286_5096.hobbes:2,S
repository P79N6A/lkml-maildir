	EPERM is absolutely reasonable - it's a pseudo-directory, it
doesn't exist on a disk anymore and nothing can be created there (nowhere
to create). Think of it as an analog of revoke() results. Returning ENOENT
on readdir() doesn't make much sense. ENOENT on opendir()? Maybe. That's
not hard to implement. Actually we need a generic mechanism to revoke
access to directory - that would take care of rmdir() on busy directory on
all filesystems. I'll look at it.

	Mix of both. It's correct behaviour, but it was an ad-hocery.
