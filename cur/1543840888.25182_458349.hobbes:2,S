Thanks, Sherlock!  Again: What does CBAUDEX, by itself, do on your
system?  As Alan Cox obviously thought the rest of the world was
bright enough to notice, and as I tried to explain, the CBAUDEX bit is
currently not defined when set by itself (i.e. as if it were CBAUDEX,
CBAUDEX | B0, CBAUDEX << 0 or however else you want to denote it);
there is always some other low-order (CBAUD) bit associated with it:
