Then "cat /proc/slabinfo" is your friend.  It lists currently allocated
objects, maximum objects that will fit in the current allocated pages,
size of object, pages used if objects were tightly packed, real pages
used, and pages per slab.
On SMP systems it also lists the number of slab cache objects kept
local to each CPU to avoid global locking when they need to allocate.
