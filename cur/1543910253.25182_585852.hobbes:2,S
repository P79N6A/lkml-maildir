NAK.  That wasn't even a serious attempt at the "fix" part,
though it does the "break" part well enough to cause severe
regressions.
(As well as leaving all my technical points about your pushback
un-addressed.  As I noted before, the evident fact that you don't
have technical responses to them says to me that your pushback
has no real technical basis ...)
Out of around 300 platform drivers in the tree (and many more
not yet merged upstream), this makes it so that only *THREE* of
them can hotplug ... versus in the current tree, essentially
everything that's not a legacy driver is hotplugging just fine.
That's one heck of a regression.  Just shy of 100% ...
Plus it treats rtc-ds1742 as if it's a platform_driver not
an i2c_driver.
