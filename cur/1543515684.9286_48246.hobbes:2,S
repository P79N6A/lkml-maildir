No, there isn't.  You basically have two options: open the root
directory of the filesystem and ioctl() to that (that is what autofs
does); that is appropriate for per-mountpoint ioctl()s.  The other
solution is to have a conventional /dev node and have your filesystem
driver also be a character device driver (this is quite trivial.)
This is appropriate for non-per-mountpoint operations; ARLA for
example uses this method.
