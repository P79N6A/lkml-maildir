Subject: [2.6.24-rc BUGFIX] SRP transport: only remove our own entries
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The SCSI SRP transport class currently iterates over all children
devices of the host that is being removed in srp_remove_host(). However,
not all of those children were created by the SRP transport, and
removing them will cause corruption and an oops when their creator tries
to remove them.
