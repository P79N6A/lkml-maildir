Yes, setting to 0.
Otherwise, only other issue I have with this interface is it won't
generalize to dealing with nfsd, where we want to set the acting context
to a context we obtain from or determine based upon the client.
Why can't cachefilesd just push a context into the kernel and pass that
into the hook as the acting context, and then nfsd can do likewise using
the context provided by the client or obtained locally from exports for
ordinary clients?  Avoids the transition SID computation altogether
within the kernel and makes this more generic.
