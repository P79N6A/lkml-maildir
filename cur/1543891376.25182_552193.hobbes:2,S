Huh, I'm a bit confused... I created this patch on top of 2.6.22-rc3-mm1
which most certainly contains a merge of git-ocfs2.patch and the series
which at least contains
mm-fix-fault-vs-invalidate-race-for-linear-mappings.patch.
So, which of Nick's patches are we talking about here?
Btw, I know you tend to handle rejects yourself, but if it's a major PITA
I'd be happy to help out. Boy, I'm hoping I didn't just ask for a load of
trouble there :)
