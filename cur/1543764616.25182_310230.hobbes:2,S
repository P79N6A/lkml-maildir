I've just checked, it takes 5.7s to compare 2.4.29{,-hf3} over NFS (13300
files each) and 1.3s once the trees are cached locally. This is without
comparing file contents, just meta-data. And it takes 19.33s to compare
the file's md5 sums once the trees are cached. I don't know if there are
ways to avoid some NFS operations when everything is cached.
Anyway, the system does not seem much efficient on hard links, it caches
the files twice :-(
