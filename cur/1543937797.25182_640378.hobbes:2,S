Hi Ingo,
with the commit
	42c9c06bec2f48002d5b6573c8700461120070a9
	x86: ACPI: use ioremap_early() instead of __va()/__pa()
you made __acpi_map_table(), which is non-__init, call early_ioremap()
which is __init on 64bit (init_64.c) but non-__init on 32bit
(ioremap_32.c).  This results in section mismatches on 32bit.
The version I have here is v2.6.24-rc8-725-g0f80375.
I had a look into ioremap_32.c and as it seems no __init function should
be called at all in the callpath down from early_ioremap() after the
__init sections are tossed out; but it is decided during runtime with
the check of after_paging_init and so the illegal references still
exist.
What is the solution here?  I have not a real clue of the code, but
perhaps we can make early_ioremap REALLY __init only and use something
different from non-init code?
