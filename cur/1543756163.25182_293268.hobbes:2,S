Looks pretty good to me.  For clarity, I'd change:
-	m7101 = pci_scan_single_device(dev->bus, 0x18);
+	m7101 = pci_scan_single_device(dev->bus, PCI_DEVFN(3, 0));
and then test m7101 for being NULL -- if it fails, you'll get a NULL
ptr dereference from pci_read_config_byte():
-	if (pci_read_config_byte(m7101, 0x5B, &val)) {
+	if (!m7101 || pci_read_config_byte(m7101, 0x5B, &val)) {
I don't think you need to bother checking the subsequent write for failure:
 	if (val & 0x06) {
-		if (pci_write_config_byte(m7101, 0x5B, val & ~0x06)) {
-			printk(KERN_INFO "PCI: Failed to enable M7101 SMBus Controller\n");
-			return;
-		}
+		pci_write_config_byte(m7101, 0x5B, val & ~0x06);
 	}
So conceptually, I approve, just some details need fixing.
