Please Larry, have a look at the environment: nobody here owns a box  
with 128 CPUs. Most of the people here take care of things they either
- own themselves                                                      
- have their hands own at work                                        
- get paid for                                                        
You will not find _any_ match with 128 CPUs here.                     
_Obviously_ you are completely right if this were a company _building_
these boxes. Then your question is the right one, as they would get   
paid for the job.                                                     
But this is a different environment. As long as you cannot buy these  
boxes at some local store for a buck and a bit, you will have no      
chance to find willing people for your approach. Therefore it is      
absolutely clear, that it will (again) walk the line from 1,2,4,8 ... 
CPUs, because the boxes will be available along this line.            
I give you this advice: if you _really_ want to move something in this
area, find someone who should care about this specific topic, and has 
the money _and_ the will to pay for development of critical GPL code  
like this.                                                            
Take the _first_ step: create the environment. _Then_ people will come
and follow your direction.                                            
Regards,                                                              
Stephan
