Working well at home and at work.
It fixed the problems i had at work with hard lockups when leaving the
box idling  on night and getting back the day after. It also fixed some
freezes i had when working on a repository converter for mercurial, the
convertion process used to be damn slow with pre1, it's now just fine.
Good work Con, it's much appreciated.
