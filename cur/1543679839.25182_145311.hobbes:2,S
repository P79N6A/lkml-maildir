Well... I don't really like to break userspace, but why don't we simply
make packet/traffic counters long long / u_int64_t? This way, we'd
simply keep almost all drivers untouched and only need to fiddle with
some sprints()/printk() statements?
Really, how many programs use the current statistics? I'd prefer to
modify them over adding strange patches like this one to the kernel...
