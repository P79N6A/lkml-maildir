Nope.  Look at pci_module_init code.  It propagates pci_register_driver
return value.
The _real_ problem is that ->probe return value is not propagated back
to pci_register_driver return value.  The reason for this is that you
may call ->probe many times, and nobody has written the code to collate
the error returns.
Since one can only sanely return an error code when there was _one_
device and it failed, you are rather limited in error propagation.
