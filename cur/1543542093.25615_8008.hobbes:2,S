The 3270 hardware itself locks up when an AID (such as enter) key is
pressed. Some program has to send a control sequence to unlock the
keyboard. During the interval, an attempted to type will result in a
temporary lockup with a big X on the status line.
What you saw was probably the VM operating system. I was a VM hacker
in the good old days and the above was made possible by some kernel
(CP) level code which captured the input, queued it, and unlocked the
3270. The user space application was unaware of the situation. 
[I am ignoring the case of VM dedicated devices for simplicity.]
This is completely unlike MVS, where the application controls the
world. In TSO, CICS, IMS, etc the terminal stays locked until the
application gets around to unlocking it. (@!%% MVS)
So the behavior you observed was from a kernel hack much like the
current Linux scheme.
