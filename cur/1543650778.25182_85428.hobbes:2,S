When the PCI Config stuff got revamped a few months ago, Greg KH, myself,
and some other people discussed this, and the conclusion seemed to be that
it was less ugly to make the code that needs bare PCI config access use fake
structs, than to have the bare functions exposed. Greg, am I remembering
correctly?
