This problem also presents itself in 2.6.10.
I remove 512M physic RAM from this TB, so it has 512M RAM left. The
problem is  then gone. The needed memory can be correctly vmalloc()
during boot without vmalloc=256m specified in boot command line.
I am curious why this happens?
1. With 512M physic RAM, vmalloc(16776989 * 8) succeeds.
2. With 1G physic RAM, vmalloc(16776989 * 8) fails.
3. With 1G physic RAM, vmalloc=256m boot option will cause kernel fail
to expand a 8M initrd image which is of 32M filesystem.
