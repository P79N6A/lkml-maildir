I do not think we can -avoid- dumping scripts/Configure[1], replacing
the existing tools.  In that respect I agree with Eric and the others. 
So your proposition makes sense.  But the configuration language can and
should be migrated, IMO.

[1] Sure you could code a replacement parser in bash shell script.  But
that's just wanking, like a Georgia Tech professor of mine:  he
implemented a visual Towers of Hanoi solver in vi macros.  We all
thought it was cool but ultimately CS wanking of no real value :)
