I don't think we want to expose domain specific information in sysfs.  
Right now, domain lifecycle events are managed in userspace so 
maintaining the kobject hierarchy here would be awkward at best.

Same thing as above with migration.  Let's try to focus on the minimum 
set of things we need to expose that we cannot expose else where.  There 
are other options (like FUSE) for providing a general filesystem 
management interface that we can do entirely in userspace.
I think Gerd mentioned earlier that ballooning can be exposed via the 
module interface--that's probably a good idea.  The ioctl() interfaces 
should probably be misc char drivers (especially since /dev/evtchn is 
already).
Here's a list of the remaining things we current expose in /proc/xen 
that have no obvious place:
1) capabilities (is the domain a management domain)
2) xsd_mfn (a frame number for our bus so that userspace can connect to it)
3) xsd_evtchn (a virtual IRQ for xen bus for userspace)
I would think these would most obviously go under something like:
/sys/hypervisor/xen/
That would introduce a hypervisor subsystem.  There are at least a few 
hypervisors out there already so this isn't that bad of an idea 
(although perhaps it may belong somewhere else in the hierarchy).  Greg?
