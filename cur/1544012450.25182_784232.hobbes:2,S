Correct, and I have not been using barriers with any earlier kernel.
I stumbled upon this because barriers are enabled by default in ext4.

Yes, I mounted it with ext3 and barrier=1 and could reproduce the problem.
ext3 did not remount the fs ro though, it seems to only disable barriers:
[    7.681759] blkfront: xvda1: write barrier op failed
[    7.681776] blkfront: xvda1: barriers disabled
[    7.681785] end_request: I/O error, dev xvda1, sector 4584
[    7.681800] end_request: I/O error, dev xvda1, sector 4584
[    7.681886] JBD: barrier-based sync failed on xvda1 - disabling barriers
And then I tested with ext4 and barrier=0 and that also works.
I don't know if this is expected behaviour or not or if it's worth
looking into.
I just wanted to report back what I saw. For me personally it's no issue.
I'll be using ext4 without barriers for a while and see how it goes.
But I'm here if you want something tested or a patch verified or anything,
but I guess this might be a Xen issue rather than vanilla kernel stuff.
Thanks for helping out with the narrowing down of the issue
