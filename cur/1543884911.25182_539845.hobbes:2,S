Did i say i was sleepy :) ?  I forgot to tell why we should always
acquire lock in same order in pending queue, we should do this
because several kernel thread will work on the pending queue.
While the running queue should only be processed by one kernel
thread; thus we do not need anymore a big lock for the GPU
only this single thread will really talk to the gpu (in fact we might
still need the lock if xorg ddx do mmio gpu regs access).
On a side note i think this scheme also fit well with gpu having
several context and which doesn't need big validation (read
nv gpu).
best,
