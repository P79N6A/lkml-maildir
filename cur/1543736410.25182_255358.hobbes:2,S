Pavel,
I've just tried to suspend my box and I must admit I've given up after 30 
minutes (sic!) of waiting when there were only 12% of pages written to disk.  
Apparently, swsusp slows down to an unacceptable level after saying "PM: 
Writing image to disk".
The box is an Athlon 64-based notebook.  The .config is available at:
http://www.sisk.pl/kernel/040925/2.6.9-rc2-mm3.config
and the output of dmesg is available at:
http://www.sisk.pl/kernel/040925/2.6.9-rc2-mm3-dmesg.log
Greets,
RJW
