Plus we've just merged a fix for NO_HZ on PXA platforms due to an utterly
broken one-shot implementation.  So chances are this problem is now fixed.
However, I object strongly to Andrew's responses to these bugs.  He's
completely out of line.
Given the wide range of ARM platforms today, it is utterly idiotic to
expect a single person to be able to provide responses for all ARM bugs.
I for one wish I'd never *VOLUNTEERED* to be a part of the kernel
bugzilla, and really *WISH* I could pull out of that function.
