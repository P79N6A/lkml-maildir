Is this code in drivers/pci/pci-driver.c, pci_register_driver() correct?
/* register with core */
 count = driver_register(&drv->driver);
if (count >= 0) {
       pci_populate_driver_dir(drv);
}
return count ? count : 1;
Looking at base/driver.c,  driver_register() returns the output from
bus_add_driver().
Looking at base/bus.c, bus_add_driver() does not return a count, it only returns
error codes.
So the code in pci_register_driver() works as long as there is no error and the
return from driver_register() is zero, but it isn't going to work right in the
error case. Also the code is just wrong because it is expecting a count that
isn't returned.
I don't know if the count is needed, but if it is, it looks like driver_attach()
would need to modified to return it instead of void.
