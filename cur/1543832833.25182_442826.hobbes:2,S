No need, all current mainstream architectures expose a constant user HZ.

Note that Alan didn't claim that *all* (Linux-supported) architectures
expose a constant user HZ, only the "mainstream" ones.  I won't get
into the debate as to what qualifies as "mainstream", but clearly IA64
does not (and should not) expose a constant value, since there were no
legacy-binary-issue and we chose to insist that apps should uses
sysconf() or equivalent if they need to know the clocktick.
