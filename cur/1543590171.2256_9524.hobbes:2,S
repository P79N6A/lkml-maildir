         Hello busy peoples, again me...
      Today got my 45gb drive slightly badblocked:
   about 70 MB in beginning... thus problem arose:
   bitmaps are heavily corrupted, and debugreiserfs  
   with -p crashes while trying to dump journal
   (he`s not alone in such behaviour: evryone doing
    that fails with Segfault). I need to dump
   all metadata to refresh bitmaps etc, but i can`t.
   3.x.0j-pre2/linux-2.4.4
   what do i have to do?
   i can provide a strace of segfaulted --fix-fixable
            thanks in advance
