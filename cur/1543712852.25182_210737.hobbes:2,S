Not at this time, as I would have to reinstall a 2.4.25 kernel.  But I
plan to do the testing soon.

Well, I see those packets with tcpdump on both the sending and receiving
interfaces, so no ethernet equipment is involved.  Moreover, the same
code works perfectly on 2.4.24, which should indicate that there are
some changes between the two (more precisely between 2.4.24 and
2.4.25-pre4) that break something.  Somehow the multicast packets are
received but not relayed to the socket...
