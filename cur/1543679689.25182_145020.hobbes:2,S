I care. Please don't break the transfer function prototype.
I don't know if you guys have realized it or not, but cryptoloop+cryptoapi
is the slowest possible loop crypto implementation on the planet. Before you
guys sacrifice loop performance with cryptoloop only stuff, you may want to
do google search for "loop-AES" (twice as fast on most modern boxes) and
choose to preserve fast interfaces that other implementations depend on.
