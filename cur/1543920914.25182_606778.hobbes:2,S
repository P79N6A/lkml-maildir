Alas, this didn't help me here.  I did manage to capture the error 
messages this time, and in the two machines I'm actively testing on, 
sata_mv is the driver that's dying in both cases.  Machine A 
additionally has sata_nv, which is working.  Machine B additionally has 
ata_piix, which is working.  So in both cases, its sata_mv that is 
throwing SError complaints:

Still digging...  this behavior showed up after libata changes went in, 
FWIW.
