It 'looks' like I have the latest?  I'm not getting any "errors".  But
with RH7.3/2.4.20 and FC3/2.6.9 inserting a CD or USB Flash drive
mounted automatically.  I upgraded to 2.6.16.16 on the previously
working FC3 machines and now it doesn't --- so I'm sure I missing
something in the kernel configuration and just don't know what it
is!?!?!
Thanks!
:b!
