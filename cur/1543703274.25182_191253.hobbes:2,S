 hello ,
   I am trying to develop a mouse driver on linux red
hat 9 on kernel 2.4.20-8 . I am using  mouse driver
code by Alan Cox available on the web. I could
successfully compile the code .
My machine is using PS/2 mouse.i reboot the machine
with mouse removed it asks me for remove
configuration.
After this when i insmod the driver and do mknod .when
i try to open this device it gives me kernel panic
giving messages as interrupt not syncing. 
 Please can u tell me as to do i test this code . Do i
need to do some special kernel configuration for
testing this code. 
 I desperately need to test this code for my project. 
It would be very kind of u if u could help me in this
matter.
 looking forward to ur reply    
                  roshan
