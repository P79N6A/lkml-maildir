Would it be viable to introduce several different schedulers to chose from
in the v2.5 development-tree, as a compile-time option. This way we would
solve most of the considerations of workstation vs webserver vs
database-server vs ftpserver etc.
I haven't got a clue if this is technically possible (well, it IS
possible, but the question is whether it's reasonable, or if it would
involve rewriting half the kernel to introduce such a change...), and if
it is anything that would be interesting.
Maybe this could help the people who need real-time systems too, by
allowing them to compile the kernel with a real-time scheduler.
Of course, a modular, hot-swappable scheduler would be best, but I figure
that'd be pretty awkward to program. Or?
