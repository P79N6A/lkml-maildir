I tried to verify your suggestion and found that the P_RTEMS symbol is
not defined on Linux. It seems to be some other kind of realtime
operating system. So the code in question already uses usleep. Now I'm
still digging for other occurances of sched_yield in the pwlib sources.
I'll keep you posted with further facts.

What's the railroad to me ?
I never go to see
Where it ends.
It fills a few hollows,
And makes banks for the swallows, 
It sets the sand a-blowing,
And the blackberries a-growing.
