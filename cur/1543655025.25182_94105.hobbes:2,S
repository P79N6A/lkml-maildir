I don't agree here. Encoding things in dma_addr_t, then special casing
in consistent_{map,unmap,sync,....) looks really ugly to me ! You want
dma_addr_t to contain a bus address for the given bus you are working
with and pass that to your device, period.
Consistency of memory (or simply, in some cases, accessibility of system
memory by a given device) is really a property of the bus. Tweaking
magic bits in dma_addr_t and testing them later is a hack. The proper
implementation is to have the consistent_{alloc,free,map,unmap,sync,...)
functions be function pointers in the generic bus structure.
Actually, the device model defines a bus "type" structure rather than a
"bus instance" structure (well, at least it did last I looked a couple
of weeks ago). That's a problem I beleive here, as those functions are
really a property of a given bus instance. One solution would eventually
be to have the set of functions pointers in the generic struct device
and by default be copied from parent to child.
Actually, to avoid bloat, I think a single pointer to a struct
containing the whole set of consistent functions is enough though, as
those will typically be statically defined.
