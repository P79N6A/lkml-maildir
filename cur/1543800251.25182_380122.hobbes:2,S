The changes in gcc aren't _that_ big.
As an example, I tried compiling recent 2.6 kernels with gcc CVS HEAD 
shortly before the 4.1 branch was created, and except for two or three 
internal compiler errors (that are OK considering that I used a random 
CVS snapshot) the kernel compiled fine.
Every gcc release might have it's own issues, but compared to e.g. the 
pains your proposal would impose on new ports, they aren't that big.
And you shouldn't forget that it's even non-trivial to find one gcc 
release that works fine compiling kernels on all architectures. As an 
example, gcc 3.2 is a known bad compiler on arm.
