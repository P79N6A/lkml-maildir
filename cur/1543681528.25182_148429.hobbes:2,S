Q:  Why doesn't USB work at all? I get "device not accepting address".
   
http://www.linux-usb.org/FAQ.html#ts6
Basically, if your PCI IRQ routing is broken, USB won't work.  Likely
that FAQ entry could stand updating (ACPI vs APCI etc).  There are
still significant issues there in 2.6 kernels; and I've hardly ever
seen ACPI do anything except break USB.
