The probe error handling is not quite correct. When we reach the fragment
above ret variable is 0 so if platfrom_device_alloc() fails we will return
0 and the device will be considered bound but in half-dead state. Please
make sure that proper error is returned in all cases. Also please do not
mix out of line and in-line error unwinding (input_free_device() should
be called in the error path and if you are concerned about double-free
after input_unregister_device() just set wm->input_dev to NULL there).
Thanks.
