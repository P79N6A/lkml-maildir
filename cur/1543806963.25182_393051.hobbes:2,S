You maintain -mm, so it's your decision.  I don't think it is a question
of right or wrong.  If you regard this stuff as too risky, dropping
it is ok.
However, I disagree with Len in two points:
- I cannot see a problem witch cache snooping.  The AMD-768 docs clearly
  states that trying to snoop the cache while in C3 is a resume event.
- Enabling C2/C3 in the BIOS would be a very bad thing IMHO.  From all
  the testing with amd76x_pm I found that is very tricky to go into
  C2/C3 "the right way".  Simply reading the PM register without a
  suitable logic around leads to all kinds of instabilities.  You need
  to implement this logic and then enable the hardware.  The BIOS cannot
  do this.
