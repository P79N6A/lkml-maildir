This still isn't getting at the core problem.  I'm sending data out the 
port and dropping characters.  The receive works fine.
It can't be a problem with the receiving device being over-run, since 
the 16550 works (even though it sends several bytes after CTS drops), 
and the 16654 doesn't (it stops after the current byte).
I think that data must be lost when the receiving device drops CTS.  
Either this is a hardware flaw (and data is lost from the transmit 
FIFO), or there is some kind of race condition between the CTS drop and 
re-loading the FIFO.
