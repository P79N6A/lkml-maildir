Yes, that's still a bug.
Was lockdep able to tell you about this in any way?

Directly dereferencing a user pointer is very bad.  Fortunately, it's
just that the above __user annotation is now wrong.

This is not a userspace pointer.

Given that this code use to perform acceptably (presumably) doing one
page at a time, I suspect that you could have retained that behaviour,
avoiding the complexity of those two arrays.  Would an additional
down_read()/up_read() per page have been unacceptably costly?
The arrays could have been allocated on the stack, I expect.  16 slots
is enough?

Please try to make this more checkpatch-friendly.  Moving the
alteration of `pages' and `status' to the end of the loop would fix
that, and would result in clearer (IMO) code.
And simply using pages[chunk_nr] everywhere would clean stuff up (IMO).

It's a small semantic change, isn't it?  We release the semaphore in
the middle of the operation, thus presenting possibly
non-internally-consistent results to userspace.  Why does this not matter?
Given the number of __user errors this patch added, I'd recommend that
v2 be checked with sparse, please.
