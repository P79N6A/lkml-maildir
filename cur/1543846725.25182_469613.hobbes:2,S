Why do so many patches degenerate into these little question-and-answer
sessions?  It's like pulling teeth.  Please completely describe the
problem.
What "newer kernels"?  The kernel has had the fall-back-to-buffered
behaviour for *ages*.
What's so bad about having a bit of pagecache floating about during what
is, I expect, a fairly rare operation?
What are the user-visible effects of this pagecache?
Please don't just sling a patch at us and leave us to guess what it's for.

"current"?  It was current about two years ago!
What I've thus far been able to decrypt from this exchange has been that
you think that the Linux direct-IO API should, as a side-effect, guarantee
that a direct-io write (and read?) of a file area should not leave that
part of the file in pagecache.
Well we _could_ define the API in that fashion.  It'd need to be carefully
documented somewhere.  But it's a fairly bizarre requirement, especially as
userspace already has quite rich ways of manipulating pagecache.
To do this right without modifying userspace we're going to need to sync
these pages to disk within the write() syscall and then invalidate them. 
That might screw somebody else up, but I think it could be justified on the
grounds that direct-io is a synchronous operation, so we should still be
synchronous if we went the buffered route.
