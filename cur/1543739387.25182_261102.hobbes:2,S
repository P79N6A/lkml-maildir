On my SMP system here at home I have not seen this instability. It's 
been rock solid since yesterday morning and I already posted the worst 
latencies that have been generated. My SMP system at work was up and 
doing fine until I shut it down when I left last night. And posted the 
high latencies from that yesterday as well. All in all it doesn't look 
too bad to me.
