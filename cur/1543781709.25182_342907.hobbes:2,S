Since you don't consider device DMA to be a copy, no, it doesn't.  The
data is transferred into page cache, then the pages are mapped into
your processes memory without an additional copy.
The pagefaulting isn't free either, I agree.  And for streaming
accesses like your copy of a large file, taking one fault per 4k
copied is not an ideal case.
Most likely you'd want Linus' pipe stuff for copying a large file
without ever looking at the data.  That work is still unfinished,
though, and I'm currently lacking time to work on it.
