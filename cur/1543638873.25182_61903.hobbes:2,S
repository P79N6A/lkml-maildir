Hmm. You have a somewhat literal idea of "dead": code that is not
called today, regardless of whether it was called yesterday and
will be needed tomorrow.
Just plain removing everything keeps the source clean but has
the unpleasant side effect that Linux no longer works on certain
machines.
Command line options must be added to ask for what this
xlate_1024 code did earlier. So, some fragments of what you remove
in this patch will have to come back in some form.
