Most of the gain I saw in Badari's profiles (dd to 60 disks) was
in fact in __wake_up.  60 tasks parked on a waitqueue, waiting
for memory to come clean, wakeups being delivered to them faster
than they can wake up and get off the queue.
Yeah, my code is bust ;)  The heavy __wake_up cost in there seems
to be specific to the profusion chipset, which is two quads joined
by wet string, but the principle still applies.
I expect a decent win would come from using this technique in
select/poll, but that code relies on the remains-on-the-waitqueue
semantics, and would need some fiddling.
