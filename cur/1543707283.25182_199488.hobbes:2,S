You can do something similiar:
config FB_RADEON
	select I2C_ALGOBIT if FB_RADEON_I2C
but then you need the patch below to avoid a bogus warning about recursive
dependecies.
Note that the select mechanism is very simple, it's applied to the
selected symbol very late, so it can override any previous selection, but
this also means it ignores any dependencies of the selected symbol. I have
plans to modify the select mechanism for 2.7, but this will be more
complex, so I added something rather simple instead (it was already quite
late during 2.5).
bye, Roman
