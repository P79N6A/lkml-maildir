It hangs in start_uhci():
		/* disable legacy emulation */
		pci_write_config_word (dev, USBLEGSUP, USBLEGSUP_DEFAULT);
The loop that the call is in gets iterated 5 times.  For i < 4, the
		if (!(dev->resource[i].flags & 1))
is TRUE, but on i==4, it drops into the bottom of the loop to execute
check_region() and then pci_write_config_word(), where it hangs.
This only seems to be a problem for initialization.  If  I load the
usb-uhci.o module before the emu10k1.o module, everything works perfectly
(no lockups).
