If you're submitting the patch, then surely you need to add your
Signed-off-by:, since you're asserting either (b) or (c):
        (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
            of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
            license and I have the right under that license to submit that
            work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
            by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
            permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
            in the file; or
        (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
            person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
            it.
We've gotten into the habit of assuming the Signed-off-by: also has
the meaning of "I vouch for it from technical point of view", but
really, that's presumably true since otherwise you wouldn't have
e-mailed it to Andrew or Linus.  The original meaning of the
Signed-off-by: is in the Developer's Certificate of Origin
statement...
