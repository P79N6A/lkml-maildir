Yes this might be true,.. those who have reported working systems might
just have a configuration where the error happens even rarer or where
some other event(s) work around it.

Some time ago I've asked here in a post if some of you could try to
contact AMD and/or Nvidia,.. as no one did,... I wrote them again (to
all forums and email addresses I knew). (You can see the text here
http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=82909
).
Now Nvidia replied and it seems (thanks to Mr. Friedman) that they're
actually try to investigate in the issue...
I received on reply from AMD (actually in German which is strange as I
wrote to their US support)... where they told me they'd have forwarded
my mail to their Linux engineers... but no reply since then.
Perhaps some of you have some "contacts" and can use them...
