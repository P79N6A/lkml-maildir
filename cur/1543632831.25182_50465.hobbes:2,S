-  If you enable this option, a subdirectory called srm_environment
-  will give you access to the most important SRM environment
-  variables. If you've got an Alpha style system supporting

+  If you enable this option, you'll find all important SRM environment
+  variables in /proc/srm_environment/named_variables/. In addition to
+  this, you can access any custom variable through its assigned number
+  in /proc/srm_environment/numbered_variables/. If you want to access
+  your SRM environment (or if you're building a generic kernel for
+  distribution) it's a good idea to say Y or M to this driver.
 
-  This driver is also available as a module and will be called
-  srm_env.o if you build it as a module.
+  If you build it as a module, the resulting file will be srm_env.o.
