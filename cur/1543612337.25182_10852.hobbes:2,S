Are you concerned with increase in memory used per counter Here? I suppose
that must not be that much of an issue for a 16 processor box....

Well, I wrote a simple kernel module which just increments a shared global
counter a million times per processor in parallel, and compared it with
the statctr which would be incremented a million times per processor in
parallel..

Hope we can come out with a really cool and acceptable interface..
