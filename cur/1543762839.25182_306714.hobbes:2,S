I'm not interested in altering and hacking up PT_GNU_STACK; PT_PAX_FLAGS
already supplies enough to do what I want.  My goal is to have
PT_PAX_FLAGS code in mainline and Exec Shield, so that if it exists in
the binary it will be used; else PT_GNU_STACK will be fallen back to.

What's setarch do for one?  Anyway, ASLR has been known to break some
things.  Blackdown Java used to break IIRC; also there's the poorly
designed Oracle and the poorly designed solution of Oracle on a 32 bit
platform; and of course there's Emacs, which I heard was broken due to
Exec Shield's randomization.  Temporary work-arounds are sometimes needed.
Remember also that I'm not just trying to make a more robust setting for
ES and mainline; I'm trying to find a way to make it so that
distribution maintainers can set one set of flags and have it assure
that the program works in Mainline, Exec Shield, and PaX.  Just a little
less work for the distribution maintainers, which I think would be a
good thing considering that apparently Ubuntu Linux might support both
PaX and Exec Shield in the future, if I'm reading this[1] right.
