Looking at net/core/datagram.c:wait_for_packet the code will return 0
when the socket has been shutdown. That causes skb_recv_datagram to loop
which is in itself obviously incorrect for a shutdown socket (its in EOF
state)
I suspect it should read something like
	/* Socket shut down? */
	if (sk->shutdown & RCV_SHUTDOWN)
	{
   		current->state = TASK_RUNNING;
	  	remove_wait_queue(sk->sleep, &wait);
 		*err = 0;
 		return 1;
	}
