Whoa, in this case it is Marcelo, and his responsiveness is on the whole 
simply superb.  Right complaint, wrong example.  Marcelo also does a 
great job of having good reasons for rejecting patches on the rare 
occasions when he does reject them.  Is the real problem that you are 
comparing guys who have neither a day job nor a family to someone who 
has both?  I think maybe it is.  Linus, do you have other work 
responsibilities besides Linux?  With funding provided , could you work 
solely on Linux?
I remember when I used to hold a day job while working on ReiserFS and 
trying to manage a team of full-time programmers by email.  It sucked. 
 There is crap in ReiserFS that went in only because I didn't have time 
to fight it, and Reiser4 is a very much higher level of quality mainly 
because I can invest a lot more time into it.
