I'm interested to write the device driver for the Intel PXA 250. See if this 
chip is uncrippled enought to get it working. I'm only trying to do the MMC 
part, I'm not interested in SD.
Do you by any chance have me a pointer to MMC related documentation (in other 
words: to the specs) ?
The MMC interface of the PXA250 processor is written in chaper 15 of the 
Developers's Manual from Intel, see
