Hi all,
I have a question regarding UFS support in the Linux kernel.
I have loaded the Linux kernel in memory and mounted root via NFS.  Is there
anyway that I can perform a UFS format on the hard drive?  The man page for
mkfs seems to suggest that minix, ext, ext2, xiafs are the only ones
supported.  I have included UFS write support in the kernel config.
Any help would be appreciated!  Thank you!!
Shirley
