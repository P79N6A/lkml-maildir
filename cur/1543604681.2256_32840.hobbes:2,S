the thrashing i complained of is gone. when running big diffs through
patch, it will thrash at the same places, but only for about a quarter
second. before, it would keep thrashing until all io was done or if i hit
scroll lock.
i did get this, however, when my initscripts ran:
task `ifconfig' exit_signal 20 in reparent_to_init
