If you want to help, you could try to gather more info on that to help 
develope a better 2.6 ;)
FWIW, 2.6.0-test* with mm patches works well here... At least in a few 
boxes.

If you're sure that it's really kswapd you can send SIGSTOP and SIGCONT 
to kswapd's pid. Kswapd will honor those signals.
killall -STOP kswapd
<run your I/O intensive scripts>
killall -CONT kswapd
Sometimes I do this... For me it works well. If this makes your machine 
crash or loose data, don't blame me! ;)
