No, there are no idle time on the system. If system become I/O bound, we
would do everything we can to remove that bottleneck, i.e., throw a couple
hundred GB of memory to the system, or add a couple hundred disk drives,
etc.  Believe it or not, we are currently CPU bound and that's the reason
why I care about every single cpu cycle being spend in the kernel code.
