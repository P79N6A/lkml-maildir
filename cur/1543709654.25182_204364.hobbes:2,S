I agree.

But some programs (hdparm?) and/or libs must (for example most C libs like

But how synchronize kernel development with glibcs (+ all other C libs + 
all other programs that must interface directly with the kernel)?
When kernel developers want to stop using something, how they should tell 
that to glibc developers and others. And how these non-kernel developers 
can change their projects in very short time to start using new kernel 
headers (= define things removed from the kernel in their own headers)? 
Most admins change kernels more often than all other programs and libs 
and these programs can potenitially not be updated yet.
My proposal is to move these things from linux-common to linux-userland 
instead of removng them from the kernel immendiatelly.
So no compatibility with user program and libs will be broken (and after a 
few releases of kernel, when all programs and libs will be updated, these 
things can be removed completly from kernel headers of all three types).
