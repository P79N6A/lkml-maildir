Hmm, do you actually read my emails? I spelled that out at least two
times now. It's converted to a new dma page allocator that specifies
an address mask.

It can be easily converted to a page allocation.
The only tricky part were skbs in a few drivers, but luckily they are only
needed for bouncing which can be done without a skb too. For RX it adds
one copy, but we can live with that because they're only slow devices.
Right now it is a little inefficient because it's one page per packet
even though two would fit, but these devices have all tiny RX rings
so it's not that big a waste.
