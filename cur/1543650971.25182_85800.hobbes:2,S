Perhaps this message might be rephrased, since "fatal" implies that "make 
install" didn't work (I'm typing on that kernel). It also might be a tad 
more helpful, to give someone a hint without reading the makefiles, etc.
End of my build and install:
make -f arch/i386/lib/Makefile 
make -f arch/i386/boot/Makefile BOOTIMAGE=arch/i386/boot/bzImage install
make -f arch/i386/boot/compressed/Makefile IMAGE_OFFSET=0x100000 arch/i386/boot/compressed/vmlinux
make[2]: `arch/i386/boot/compressed/vmlinux' is up to date.
sh arch/i386/boot/install.sh 2.5.44-ac5 arch/i386/boot/bzImage System.map ""
fatal error: unable to find a suitable template
