Are you saying that you enabled or disabled CONFIG_MTRR? You should
always enable it on SMP systems, otherwise you can get machine lockups
or crashes. Some BIOSes are buggy, and setting CONFIG_MTRR=y means
that Linux fixes the problem.
The MTRR stuff can also be used to improve graphics performance, but
that's not really intended to be something the user worries about. The
intention is that your X server or kernel graphics driver sets this up
for you.
