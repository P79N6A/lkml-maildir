Hmm, that would seem to be an important piece of information -
could be a gcc-3.2.3 compiler bug.  Since noone here is able to
trigger this problem with other compilers too (and under a lot
more varied conditions around the ENOSPC boundaries), I suppose
a gcc bug is a real possibility here.
cheers.
