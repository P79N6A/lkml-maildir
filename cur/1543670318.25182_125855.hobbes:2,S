It doesn't pass the test of "would I use it if I didn't think it was
faster?"
As I pointed out, your variant is not faster with a reasonable
compiler, only less obvious. And none of this sort of optimization
will ever be measurably better in the IO path anyway. But every one of
these false optimizations is a barrier to the understanding that will
allow real cleanups to make fundamental improvements.
