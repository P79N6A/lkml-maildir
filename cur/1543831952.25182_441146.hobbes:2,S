This requirement must be treated the same way as the EMFILE error in
open(): ignore the OPEN_MAX limit if ulimit says so.  The question is
what to do if the ulimit < OPEN_MAX.  POSIX does not require OPEN_MAX
to be the exact limit.
So, I think removing the OPEN_MAX comparison is the correct way to do
this here.  If somebody wants strict POSIX compliance they have to set
ulimit -n to 256.
