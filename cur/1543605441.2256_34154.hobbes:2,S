That isn't wholly true.  A 4MB hash table can never fit in the cache of 
an Athlon, and for one that's being used as a workstation with 1GB of 
ram and maybe 60 connections active on average, that's a huge waste of 
ram, and a guarantee that there will be lots of cache misses which just 
aren't required.  Keep the cache footprint as low as possible -- it 
results in a system that performs better.
