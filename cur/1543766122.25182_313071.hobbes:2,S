Hi,
I noticed, that starting from 2.6.10, the function (fs/jbd/transaction.c)
void journal_callback_set(handle_t *handle,
              void (*func)(struct journal_callback *jcb, int error),
                   struct journal_callback *jcb)
along with the structure members of handle_s (include/linux/jbd.h)
struct list_head        h_jcb;
and the following members of transaction_s
spinlock_t              t_jcb_lock;
struct list_head        t_jcb;
has been removed. Since I didn't find any discussion of this on this
list or anywhere else on the web, I wondered about the motivation
behind this, and how code that references these function/members
should be modified. Is it dangerous to reinclude the eliminated parts
of the code?
Please reply to me personnally, since I am not subscribed to the list.
Thanks,
Roland
