You would have to store the checksums on the filesystem then, or use a
verify-after-write.  What I was talking about is a
verify-the-buffer-didn't get scribbled.  I'd then trust the hardware to
report a write failure.  Note that if something scribbles on your buffer
between the time you put good data on it and when it gets transfered to
disk, you can verify perfectly and still have a hosed filesystem.
It was pointed out that you can't really do what I'm suggesting for
mmaped file data, and there's some truth to that - but certainly the
interval between when ->writepage gets called and when the actual buffer
write happens can be secured in this way.  Doing this only for metadata
is also a good idea because then the overhead would be close to nil and
the basic fs integrity would be protected.
