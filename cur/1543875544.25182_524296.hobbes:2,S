Ah, that's a new twist.  Cool testcase.  A mechanism which was put in
specifically to prevent tasks from jumping straight to max interactive,
and thus hurting truly interactive tasks, is starving these not truly
interactive (but nothing says they couldn't be) tasks.
One way to prevent this may be to do something very simple like (I did
this here a while back) upon timeslice completion (or possibly better,
round-robin interval [whenever]), promote a task from a lower priority
queue.  Tasks are then always crawling up the ladder, and _will_ be
inserted into the stream no matter what is going on in the system.  The
lower the task's priority, the longer it takes to crawl up, but it will
get there.  I'll try this again, and see how it handles your testcase,
and how it affects interactivity.  There are many others ways of course,
limiting queue runtime etc etc.
