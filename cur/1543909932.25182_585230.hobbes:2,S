Errors are very consistent.  Data transfer from the host to the drive
fails and SError indicates Handshake Error, Non-recovered transient data
integrity error and often Recovered Data integrity error.  For some
reason, your drive doesn't like what it's hearing from the controller
and replies with R_ERR.

As error reporting when using ata_piix is very limited.  It gets
reported as host bus error but I think it's basically the same problem.
I don't think this is driver issue.  I have the same controller and I've
never seen similar thing happening and I have plenty of drives and test
them often.  Error reports also point to transmission problems.  Your
drive just doesn't like what it's hearing.  Does 'smartctl -a /dev/sda'
tell anything special?
