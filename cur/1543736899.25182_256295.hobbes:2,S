During compilation of cloop I noticed it had LZMA compression.  Looks
like I need to do my research.
This may still be interesting to use for zisofs; although at this point
I appear to be producing a lot of white noise.  Still, I'd like to see
LZMA ported out of cloop and into cryptoapi or such, where it can be
more generally useful.
