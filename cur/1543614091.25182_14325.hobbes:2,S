Dear Mailing List,
I'm having great problems with ARP. Frankly, kernel 2.4.16 never gets the
proper arp address of the next-hop-router, no matter what I try.
My equipment: 
Suse 7.3 , kernel upgraded to 2.4.16
3com 3c509-b tx isapnp ethcard eth0
msi-something geforce2mx 200
sb16 isapnp
thunderbird 1.2 ghz
gigabyte 7ixe4 motherboard
512 mb ram @ 100 mhz fsb
I can only ping the IP of the network card itself.
Whenever I ping my nexthop router (ip: x.x.x.1) i get a pause of a few
seconds, then a whole sequence of "Destination unreachable".
Looking at the arp cache using "arp -a", I see that the arp cache is
always incomplete (always KEEPS being incomplete). 
Any clue is greatly appreciated, but I do suspect that the kernel 2.4.16's
ARP code is buggy since Win98 , win2k etc works flawlessly.
Yours
Alex
