Hi Bernhard,
I think we might need to do more here. Because [offset] is optional, one
would assume that things will work even if offset is not specified. But
in this patchset, that's not the case for i386 and x86_64. It will silently
fail if a user does not specify the offset. No memory will be reserved for
capture kernel.
I think we either need to make offset mandatory or put in additional
intelligence here to choose the offset automatically based on the memory
available.
Thanks
Vivek
