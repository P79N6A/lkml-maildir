input needs it :/ Take a look at drivers/input/evdev.c:evdev_write_compat
Someone should roast in hell for that code.

I have given in for now. Assuming the test is done on a flag that is only set
by the system call entry path. But I still think it will result in
a lot of ugly code. For for read/write it's hard to avoid because
there are so many variants and we have too many message passing
protocols now.
That said I have been too lazy so far to actually implement it:/
