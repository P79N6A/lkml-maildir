Well, just about any sane set of device sizes causes sz to rapidly
exceed min_spacing.  You'll notice that my failure case is
{ 800MB, 151kB, 152kB, 153kB, 154kB }.
And even in the failure case, it's just a read from uninitialized
memory, which is probably either a small value (so it won't make the
answer very wrong) or a large value (so it will be rejected in the
immediately following code).  In my case it happened to be some slab
poison of 0xa5a5a5a5 or something like that, and the code went on just
fine.
