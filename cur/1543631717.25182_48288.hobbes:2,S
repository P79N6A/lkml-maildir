I misread this paragraph, the rest of my reply follows from this laps.
I said there was no "priority inversion" in the sense that there are
no priority inversion problems during the execution of such user-space
rt tasks. From a purely static perspective, however, the user-space
rt tasks do indeed come to have a higher priority than the kernel.
No fuss there.
That being said, I differ on your judgement of this method.
