I have two main reasons:
- Why wrap assembler instructions in C code if you just can move them
into an already existing assembly file? Much cleaner IMO.
- I'm currently working on making kexec to work under xen/dom0. And by
moving the segment handling code into the assembly file we reduce the
amount of duplicated code.
I was concerned about the size of the assembly code too and I just
re-checked with my patches applied:
i386: 300 / 4096 bytes used
x86_64: 364 / 4096 bytes used
I'd say we have more than enough space!
Thanks,
