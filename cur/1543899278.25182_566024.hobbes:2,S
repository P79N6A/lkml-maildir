Yes, ondemand and conservative may refuse to load/work on systems with
a high transition latency and that is sometimes discovered only at
runtime. This makes them not selectable as default governors.

No, some more work is needed (e.g.: falling back to a different governor
if the selected fails). Thomas Renninger has posted patches on
cpufreq-devel to accomplish that.
