At least I have the attention of StarOffice boys now. Sorry if I had to
scream loudly and publically. I tried to contact StarDiv and all I got was
a stinky marketdroid e-mail telling me to phone them. I can't do that
unfortunately since I'm deaf.

When you were developing, you should have subscribed to alpha-glibc and
glibc mailing lists - they might have helped to give answers

You have to stop using 2.0 specific features and use features that are
common to both glibc versions. 
I think recompiling with the glibc-2.1 libraries should do the trick
(trying to compile should show up most of the problems and then it's a
simple matter to modify)
Cheers,
Alex
