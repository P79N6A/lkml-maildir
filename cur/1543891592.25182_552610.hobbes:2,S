    Note that I didn't change what the old code was doing in this regard -- 
although the HPT374 spec does *not* say that UDMA6 is supported, it had been 
enabled. What have *really* changed for HPT374 was:
- in 2.6.20-rc1, the driver switched to using the actual 33 MHz timing table
   instead of the old one, matching 50 MHz (and so, severely underclocked);
- in 2.6.2-rc1, the driver switched from 33 MHz PCI to 66 MHz DPLL clock.
    Disallowing UDMA6 would clock the chip with 50 MHz DPLL, howewer, the 
original report claimed that something has changed to worse between 2.6.21.1 
and .3 but nothing changed in drivers/ide/ between those releases...

    I don't think this will matter...
