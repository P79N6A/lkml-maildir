Unfortunately, but the time I can get a chance to run hwclock, the
problem seems to have fixed itself.  I tried booting into single user
mode, but `/etc/init.d/hwclock.sh restart` succeeds once I have my prompt.
A few other facts:
- This is an Athlon64 box running X83_32
- I use hpet=force for the Via chipset
- A little more of the demsg is:

So the TSC is being marked unstable because of cpufreq changes. I have
no idea when it comes to TSCs and HPETs and how the RTC works (other
than what the abbreviations stand for), so this all may be meaningless.
 I'll try disabling cpufreq to see if that has an effect.
