CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP is the default when SPARSEMEM is enabled
on x86_64.   The overall default remains DISCONTIGMEM, mainly as a
safety measure while the i386/x86_64 => x86 merge stablises.  But yes
this code is only used when SPARSEMEM is enabled but VMEMMAP is not.
So it is effectivly redundant.

That patch seems to have a laudable goal of trying to push the memory
which backs the sparsemem memmap out to non-dma memory.  I would have
expected that call to actually succeed as the bootmem allocator seems to
try at the goal which would likely be outside the node on a small
machine, and then retry without a goal.  Which is what the code without
the goal does.  Most illogical.

This code is definatly only used when SPARSEMEM is enabled, and VMEMMAP
is not which is not a combination we see on x86_64.
