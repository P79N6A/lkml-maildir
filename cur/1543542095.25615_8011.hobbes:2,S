GREAT HUNCH!
Well, that got rid of the initrd extended beyond message...
And later it at least FINDS a compressed image....(Just used a known good 
filesystem and it boots)
Is this a bug report that it doesn't see the memsize correctly compared to 
previous kernels?  Can't be putting mem= in my distro..
rts 4096, the zone(1) reports 3840, and zone(2) is 0)

When I added the INITRD_SIZE paramater to the printk statement, I get `692836`
That is the EXACT size of my initrd.gz file.
So now we know what is going on, but what is the BUG resolution...
Is it a problem with the sysloader, the 1743k disk, or the memory that the 
new 2.4 kernel isn't handling??
