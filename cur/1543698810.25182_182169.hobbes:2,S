Okay, the first thing to try is removing devfs from the equation if
possible. Your mount is getting back -ENXIO, suggesting whatever device
you're trying to mount doesn't exist according to the kernel. devfs
does device management internally to the kernel, so it's a likely culprit.
It would also be helpful to find the command-line arguments issued to
mount(8) when it's failing, as well as more information about the
contents of your initrd. Can you boot without an initrd?
