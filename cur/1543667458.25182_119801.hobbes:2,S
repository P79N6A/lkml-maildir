I think a solution like this would be best, having a "-fix" tree or 
similar for
the latest stable kernel maintained by a volunteer and hosted by kernel.org.
Optionally or alternatively there could/should be a mailinglist (yes, 
one more
:-) where all critical fixes like sec + fs fixes, etc. are posted to, for
people building their own kernels (and interested in staying up-to-date) 
but
not willing/having the time/able to dig through the tons of emails 
brought by
lkml.
Cause I think if you're not an active kernel developer or having some 
issues
with running a kernel, or like me, just interested and still learning to
understand linux kernel programming in the far future ;-) you shouldn't have
to read lkml just for building and maintaining your own, none-vendor 
kernel.
Btw, if you had to, I think there might even be the danger of loosing some
critical fixes in the loads of emails.
