But kconfig is mainly for kernel hackers, otherwise it would be

/me is filled with wonder at the discovery that .config is saved in the O=
directory. Thanks a lot Adrian for this time saver. So it's not strictly an
output directory, more a build directory.
I still think "make oldconfig CONFIG_FOO=bar" is useful for the occasional
config change, but thanks again for this great tip.
