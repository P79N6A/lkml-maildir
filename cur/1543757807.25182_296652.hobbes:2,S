I'm going to have a look at refcounting page table pages, which
will hopefully allow us to get back (and more) the clear_page_range
overhead introduced by the aggressive page table freeing.
It may also allow nice things like dropping file backed page table
mappings if they get reclaimed, and also a single walk to do the
freeing. I haven't looked into details yet though, these are just
vague hopes.

I have a feeling it should provide nice benefits to all archs if
we get it into all the walkers. Downsides are few - the bitmap walk
probably only becomes more expensive when all but a handful of
cachelines are present in a page table page.
I'd like to look at ways to make this patch happen with you soon...
First, for 2.6.12 my main concern is to get pt walking consistent,
and try to claw back some of the clear_page_range regression.
Thanks,
Nick
