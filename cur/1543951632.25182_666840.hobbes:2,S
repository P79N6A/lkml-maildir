It's kind of hard to read the context diff (unified diffs are much nicer) but 
nothing jumps out at me regarding your video config.  Does the blank screen 
problem occur if you disable usplash altogether and compile out the fb 
drivers?  The intelfb driver in particular can cause problems sometimes since 
it supports so few configurations, you might try the vesafb driver too.
