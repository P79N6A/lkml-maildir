Hrmph, what an annoying problem.  The below works pretty well, but
_still_ has latency problems in some circumstances.
The more I look at this, the more I think these guys _really_ want to be
a separate class.  The problem is the incredible rate of min_vruntime
advancement creating absurdly huge spreads.
Hm, maybe I could advance min_vruntime at nice 0 when these guys are
running, only advance their vruntime at warp 512, but that seems awfully
hackish.  If they were a separate class, they could use the full nice
spectrum instead of being merely mega-nice.
