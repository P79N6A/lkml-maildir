Binding a directory that you have access to in other was is essentially
the same thing as a symlink.  So there are no real security implications
there.  The only problem case I can think of is removal media that you
want to remove but someone has made a bind mount to.  But that is
essentially the same case as opening a file so there are no new
real issues.  Although our diagnostic tools will likely fall behind
for a bit.
We handle the security implications by assigning an owner to all mounts
and only allowing you to add additional mounts on top of a mount you
already own.
If you have the right capabilities you can create a mount owned by
another user.
For a new mount if you don't have the appropriate capabilities nodev
and nosuid will be forced.
Initial super block creation is a lot more delicate so we need the
FS_SAFE flag, to know that the kernel is prepared to deal with the
crazy things that a hostile user space is prepared to do.
