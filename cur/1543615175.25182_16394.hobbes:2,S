I found ERROR :)
IF You look at your patches YOU WILL SEE:
Only in linux-2.2.20/drivers/block: README.buddha
Only in linux-2.2.20/drivers/block: aec62xx.c
diff -ur linux-2.2.20-vanilla/drivers/block/ali14xx.c
linux-2.2.20/drivers/bloc
so ERROR is in your patch or exactly at diff line,
the Only files are *not* in patch !!!
use diff -u -r -N or diff -u -r -P to
make diff
I send you my patches for 2.2.20 again.
Regards,
 Zoran D.
