There are positive reports in the never-ending "my system crawls like an 
XT when copying large files" bugzilla entry:
 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7372
 " vfs_cache_pressure=1
   TCQ   nr_requests
   8     128    not that bad
   1     128    snappiest configuration, almost no pauses
                (or unnoticable ones) "
 " 1) vfs_cache_pressure at 100, 2.6.21.5+per bdi throttling patch 
   Result is good, not as snappier as I'd want during a large copy but 
   still usable. No process seems stuck for agen, but there seems to be 
   some short (second or subsecond) moment where everything is stuck 
   (like if you run a top d 0.5, the screen is not updated on a regular
   basis).
   2) vfs_cache_pressure at 1, 2.6.21.5+per bdi throttling patch Result
   is at 2.6.17 level. It is the better combination since 2.6.17. "
 " 1) I've applied the patches posted by Peter Zijlstra in comment #76 
   to the 2.6.21-mm2 kernel to check if it removes the problem. My
   impression is that the problem is still there with those patches,
   although less visible then with the clean 2.6.21 kernel. "
so the whole problem area seems to be a "perfect storm" created by a 
combination of TCQ, IO scheduling and VM dirty handling weaknesses. Per 
device dirty throttling is a good step forward and it makes a very 
visible positive difference.
