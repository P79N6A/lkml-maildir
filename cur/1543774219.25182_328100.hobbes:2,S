I'm glad to see that work is progressing on SPI core.  I've worked on 
drivers on both ARM linux and Blackfin uclinux that use SPI and would 
prefer that they not be platform specific.
What I've found in my Blackfin work is that I need asynchronous SPI 
support.  The driver starts an SPI transaction and receives a callback 
when the SPI transaction has completed.  The operations are similar to 
what you've suggested, except that the message structure includes a 
pointer to a callback and a void *data pointer. 
The driver I'm working on is for the Chipcon CC2420 802.15.4 radio, 
which uses SPI to access its registers and transmit and receive FIFOs.  
In my CC2420, it queues SPI requests and initiates the next one when an 
SPI transaction completes.
