I can confirm this is a *GENERIC* X86_64 problem:
----
Kernel command line: console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200 hdb=noprobe root=/dev/md0
init/main.c start_kernel(): interrupts were disabled@525
ide_setup: hdb=noprobe
init/main.c start_kernel(): interrupts were enabled@529
...
start_kernel(): bug: interrupts were enabled early
----
This is on a dell 1950 with a core 2 duo processors.
You have to have ide compiled in, and set ide options to get the irq's enabled,
and then have a setup which will have an irq pending before the irq controller
get's initialized to get the panic. The dell1950 does not panic, the kernel
merely warns.
I am pretty sure the i386 tree has the same problem but I haven't checked yet.
Anyway: the panic is just a way of noticing. The bug is that irq's are enabled
before the irq controller is set up.
But to make the ide_setup/irq bug go away, I think it might be an acceptable
solution to just disable the irq's again after the parse_args, and just to wait
until the SATA tree takes over the IDE tree.
