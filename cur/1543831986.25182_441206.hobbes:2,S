1) I would go further and try ERESTARTSYS: ERESTARTSYS means that the 
kernel signal handler honors SA_RESTART
2) At least for the futex functions, it won't be as easy as replacing 
EINTR wiht ERESTARTSYS: the futex functions receive a timeout a the 
parameter, with the duration of the wait call as a parameter. You must 
use ERESTART_RESTARTBLOCK.
