Hi,
System: debian/unstable
I just tried 2.6.9-rc3-mm3 and I have two problems:
- - he calls himself 2.6.9-rc-mm31, yeah 31. I don't know where this comes
from, because in the Makefile itself it is mm3. Whatever makes him do
that, I don't know, but he install himselfs like this, perhaps the
problems come from that
- - cdrecord segfaults. Again I don't know if this is cdrecords fault or
not, but cdrecord works fine with 2.6.9-rc2-mm1
If needed I provide the kernel config.
