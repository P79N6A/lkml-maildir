Today is not my day :(
I've discover that the ncpfs package i find in sunsite is too old, and
grabbed a new version from the original place (ftp.gwdg.de) that
Doc/filesystems/ncpfs.txt explains. Now compilation was done fine, and i
will now configuring my machine to talk with netwares. But i'm still in
doubt about netatalk. If i also need to download another package from
another location, i'm again awaiting.
Sorry and thanks for your patience. :)
