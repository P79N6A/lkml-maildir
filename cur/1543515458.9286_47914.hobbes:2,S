Especially for RTLinux.  This is also a problem on SPARC s-bus devices
where the handler is supposed to do something to clear the interrupt.
On some systems with particularly stupid interrupt handling architectures,
RTLinux will only be able to either support periodic tasks  or require
patches to all devices handlers.
