yes, this is probably the insert-ioapics-and-local-apic-into-resource-map
patch.  Does mainline crash too?  It should.  Or at least, it should have
the same resource allocation errors.
I've backed that out and applied an updated version.  My current rollup
(which actually seems to mostly compile now) is at
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/badari.bz2
That's against 2.6.18.  Can you see if that fixes things?

Once upon a time we'd have got a backtrace from that.
