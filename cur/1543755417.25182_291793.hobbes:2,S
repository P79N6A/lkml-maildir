This patch is mangled.  Long lines are wrapped, and appears to be in
ISO-8859-1, such that spaces (ascii 0x20) appear as hex 0xa0.  This
makes it difficult to review, and impossible to apply.
+// definitions for the device attributes for exporting logical drive number
+// for a scsi address (Host, Channel, Id, Lun)
+
+CLASS_DEVICE_ATTR(megaraid_mbox_app_hndl, S_IRUSR, megaraid_sysfs_show_app_hndl,
+           NULL);
How is this being used by your apps please?
Otherwise the patch looks sane.
Thanks,
Matt
