I have a repeatable problems with kernels 2.4.25 and 2.4.26 which
is not present in 2.4.18
With the newer kernel transferring data via cp from a remote nfs
mounted file system takes very long times, with frequent nfs timeouts.
By long I mean more that 20 minutes to transfer 80Mb.  With 2.4.18 this
happens as fast as transfers to the remote machine (which is flawless
in 2.4.26 as well).  This is over a PCMCIA 100mbit ether card
