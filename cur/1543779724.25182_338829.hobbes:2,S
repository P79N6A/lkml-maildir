Dear all,
I have a driver implemented to support single partition in 2.6 kernels.
I have a requirement of supporting multiple partitions in my block driver to support flash media devices.
I have modified the alloc_disk(1) to alloc_dosk(16) to support a MAX of 16 partitions. This way I have conveyed it to the kernel that 16 is my max n/o partitions. I also made a call to add_disk().
Do I need to handle any thing in the request function to handle read/writes to the device partitions?
Please suggest me the required implementation that I may be missing?
Regards,
Mukund Jampala
