exit_mmap() is only called from kernel/fork.c/mmput(). We call exit_mmap()
only if (atomic_dec_and_lock(&mm->mm_users, &mmlist_lock)).
So there are no other active thread (mm_user) other than the current
exit_mmap() thread. This gives thread exclusion. So we don't need
mm->mmap_sem.
However, we have to lock out truncate()->zap_pmd_range(), rmap.c
functions, and other places from walking the page tables while we
are freeing the page tables in exit_mmap(). The page_table_lock in
exit_mmap() provides that exclusion.
That's my understanding. Correct me if I am wrong.
Thanks,
Rajesh
