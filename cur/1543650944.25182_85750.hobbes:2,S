You cannot use kernel_fpu_begin in interrupt context,
and the csum copy functions can be called from that in some 
cases (e.g. TCP retransmit timer). You need to check for 
in_interrupt() too.
I think the problem in your case is that you don't save/restore
your registers properly around the function call. C calling
conventions allow to clobber some of them and you don't seem
to handle that.
