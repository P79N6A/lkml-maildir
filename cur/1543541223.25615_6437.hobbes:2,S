On the subject of pursuading UVic to release the Rigi
reverse-engineering kit as a GPL, I received the following email from
Johannes --- He is asking a more urgent favour which would have the
GPL of Rigi as a side effect: There is a new set of parser tools which
have been developed at Bell Canada and are in danger of being shelved
and forgotten unless the current owners can build a GPL case for their
management before they leave ... ie by _August_ _11th_! (this Friday).
Perhaps if members of this list were to forward some fast friendly
words of support and encouragement we can help them make their case ;)
I am including the linux-kernel list as there may be people there who
support the open-source release of quality reverse engineering tools,
but who may not be following our linux-doc discussions.

Yes, this might be helpful.

Let's try something else first:
Some people at Bell Canada have been writing C/C++ and Java parsers
(called DATRIX) that are almost ready to be used with Rigi and other
similar tools. However these guys just got a new job somewhere else, and
so the code may disappear in some filing cabinets at Bell, unless they can
convince their management to release the source code as open source. They
were asking for people to email them in support of the open source idea.
I'm including Bruno Lague's (the project lead) email with the announce of
the changes, and also his reply to my email in support of the open source
idea for your reference. It would be great if you could get some people to
send him a supporting email, pointing out how great a tool DATRIX is and
how much more people would be able to benefit from it if it was open
source, preferably BY AUGUST 11 (that's his last day at Bell Canada).
Bell Canada, as IBM, UVic, and many others, are members of the CSER
(Canadian Consortium for Software Engineering Research). If they set an
example, it might be an incentive for UVic/IBM to follow suit. Since 
Bell Canada's CSER contact (Francois Coallier) seems to be in favour of
the open source idea, there's a good chance, that we will succeed.

Subject: Datrix
Dear CSER members and international R&D users of Datrix,
We are pleased to provide you all with a license for all datrix tools 
on all platforms that will expire in one year, on July 31, 2001.
You can also download the last version (3.6.11) of Datrix tools from 
our web site which was just released on July 27.
We also wish to inform you all that we, Sebastien Lapierre, Charles 
Leduc and myself, all received an offer from a new company recently, 
and that the three of us accepted it. We will be leaving Bell Canada 
on August 11, and thus we will not have a chance to meet with all of 
you again before our departure.
Our involvement in the software engineering R&D community and in
the CSER in particular has been a very interesting, exciting and
enriching experience. It has been a real pleasure to work with you
all, and to twist the evolution of Datrix (which initially was a 
basic C/C++ metric tool when we joined Bell), into a solid multi-purpose 
and multi-language AST/ASG generator with the potential of suiting the 
needs of various research projects in the CSER and world wide. 
The future of Datrix is open to many options, one of them being to
make it an open source project. All options are still open. If 
the open source one is of interest to you and your research lab, 
please let me know before August 11, as the level of interest 
expressed by the researchers community will influence the decision.
(If you are a student, don't be shy in voicing your opinion as well!)    
We all strongly wish that Datrix will continue to serve your needs, 
and whatever option is retained for the future of Datrix, we intend 
to spend some of our non-business hours to back whoever will 
take the lead on the evolution of this software from now on. 
Please watch the Datrix web site to see further news, at either:
http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/labs/gelo/datrix/
or 
http://www.casi.polymtl.ca/casibell/datrix/
Thanks again to everyone who gave us feedback and thus helped us in 
tuning this set of tool. 
Wish you all the best,
Bruno Lague 
Sebastien Lapierre
Charles Leduc

Hi Johannes,
Thanks for your wish. And thanks for your support for the open source
option. We need that kind of notes in order to build a good case
for Bell's executive to make that decision. If the research 
community strongly voice its desire to access datrix and stresses
the benefits for them, it will definitely help Francois to get
our VP's approval.
We were just beginning to have a closer interaction with you,
and to me, it was very promising. This is one of the things that
makes it difficult to leave the datrix project for us. If the 
project becomes open source, we will have a chance to interact
again. In any case, I would be very glad to see our paths cross
again in the future...
ciao,
Bruno

Subject: RE: Datrix & GXL
Johannes,
Recently, Sebastien added an option to Datrix parsers to dump
the AST/G in a ".dot" format, which is needed by graphviz.
This output format completes the .ta and the .vcg formats
we already supported. GXL is so close to TA, it should be doable
in a snap (took about 2 days to sebastien to add a .dot format),
a snap of time we don't have before leaving though. However, 
if Datrix is released in the public domain as we hope it will,
that's may be the first community contribution... If one looks
at how the dumping of the AST is done for vcg/ta/dot, it should
be relatively simple for someone to figure how to add what it
takes to produce GXL.
ciao,
Bruno
