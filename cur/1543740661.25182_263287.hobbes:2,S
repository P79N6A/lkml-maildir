remap_pfn_range() has identical functionality. It's been given a
distinct entrypoint name so people don't feed it raw physical addresses
by accident. It is an improvement because its interface doesn't truncate
physical addresses. I've got no idea what happened to the
drivers/char/mem.c hunk of my patch. Just check the archives, and see
that the patches I posted do actually sweep drivers/char/mem.c.
