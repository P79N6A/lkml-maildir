The volume of traffic we as a vendor get every time an issue
makes news (and sadly even the insignificant issues seem to be
making news these days) from users wanting to know where our
updates are is a good indication that your thinking is clearly bogus.

I fail to see the point you're trying to make here.

I think the timelyness isn't the issue, the issue is making sure that
the kernel.org kernel actually does end up getting the fixes.
That 2.6.10 got out of -rc with known vulnerabilities which were
known to be fixed in 2.6.9-ac is mind-boggling.  That a 2.6.10.1
didn't follow up yet is equally so.
Part of the premise of the 'new' development model was that vendor kernels
were where people go for the 'super-stable kernel', and the kernel.org
kernel may not be quite so polished around the edges. This seems to
go against what you're saying in this thread which reads..
'kernel.org kernels might not be as stable as vendor kernels, but you're
 going to need to run it if you want security holes fixed asap'

That openness comes at a price. I don't need to bore you with
analogies, as you know as well as I do how wide and far Linux
is deployed these days, but doing this openly is just irresponsible.
Someone malicious on getting the announcement of a new kernel.org release
gets told exactly where the hole is and how to exploit it.
All they'll need to do is find a target running a vendor kernel before
updates get deployed.  Whilst this is true to a certain degree
today, as not everyone deploys security updates in a timely manner
(some not at all), things can only get worse.
