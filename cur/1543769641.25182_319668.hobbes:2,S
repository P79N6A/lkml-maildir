Hi all,
A new release of the ocf-linux package is up:
	
http://ocf-linux.sourceforge.net/
A lot of changes in this release.  Best to check the Changelog below
for the specifics.  Most of the changes have centered around RNG, PKE
or getting Openswan running with OCF.
No 2.6 testing was done for this release,  but it should be close
if it doesn't work.
The OpenSwan 2.3.0 patch of accelerates receive packets only
at this point.  This is just to get the basics out there for comment
while the transmit side is coded.
Changes:
* Mostly complete SKB processing for all drivers
* Numerous fixes to all drivers (esp. cryptosoft)
* All drivers can now do ESP/AH processing on buffers, skb's
  or iovecs.
* Re-work of the ixp4xx driver (multiple  outstanding requests)
* PKE support working in safenet
* New demand driven RNG support with optional FIPS140 testing of data
* Openswan RX-only support for comment
* Fixed race condition in ocf driver startup
Cheers,
Davidm
