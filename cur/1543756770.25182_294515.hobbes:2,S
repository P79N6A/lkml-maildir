Thats the one.  I read this in APPENDIX F:
"The following AGP chipsets are supported by NVIDIA's AGP; for all other
chipsets it is recommended that you use the AGPGART module."
as saying 'if you have one of these chipsets use nVagp' else use agpgart.

I have had no issue at all running agpgart on Slackware 10 with KDE 3.3.x.  It 
was just when I read this thread I didn't realise there was another option of 
a different NV module.  I just tried it after reading deeper in the 
readme.txt ref. the Quake2 OpenGL 'rippling wave' I get every 5 minutes or 
so.  It fixed it, BTW.  I now have a constant clear display 100% in Quake2 :)  
I haven't noticed any difference at all in 2d desktop stuff (except maybe it 
is slightly brighter).
