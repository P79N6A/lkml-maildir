> But, as Linus says, how many laptops come with only 8MB these days?
Americans (and Canadians) really don't get it do they
If you pop over to mexico you'll find a lot of 8Mb computers. Or much of
eastern europe or india, or .. etc
A lot of students in these parts of the world have low end machines.
Finally people want to install Linux on *second hand* machines. Hell if we
wanted to support just new stuff we could drop PCMCIA (cardbus has replaced
it), drop modems (you've all got cablemodem right), and anything lower
than a PII processor
