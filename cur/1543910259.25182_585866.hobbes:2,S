Subject: group ownership of tun devices -- nonfunctional?

Per the post here:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/18/228
it appears that the group ownership patch has made it into .23.  I am
using these patches, amongst which the kernel component appears to be
identical:
http://sigxcpu.org/unsorted-patches/0001-allow-tun-ownership-by-group.patch
http://sigxcpu.org/unsorted-patches/tunctl_gid.diff
I can create devices that are owned by my user account (tunctl -u
`whoami` -t tap0) and it works fine.  However, if I use group
permissions with -g it stops working.  In all cases, if I pass -g
<group>, the interface is created correctly but it is unusable as a
non-root user.
So my question is: am I doing something wrong?  If I am, I don't see
it.  Assuming then that I am not doing anything wrong on my end, I
assume then that there is something missing from the kernel patch I
applied.  I read over it and I can't see any issues, especially
considering that tunctl comes back without error (even with -g) and
creates an interface.
Just wondering if this was an issue that should be looked into--
Mike
