Hi.
If I use outl everything seems to be OK. Is there any difference in endianity 
between outl and writel (or iowrite32, which calls writel, I guess).
When I do
outl(val, p->ibase + 4*off);
everyhting is OK, but when I do
writel(val, p->iaddr + off);
bad value is written unless I use cpu_to_be32(val) (or swap32).
this is what p struct contains:
         u32 __iomem *iaddr;
         unsigned long ibase;
and this, how it is initialized:
         p->ibase = pci_resource_start(pdev, 2);
         p->iaddr = pci_iomap(pdev, 2, 0);
What's the proper use of this? iowrite32be seems to work too.
thanks,
