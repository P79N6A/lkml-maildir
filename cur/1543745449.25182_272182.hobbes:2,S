Good idea, patch forthcoming.

No, it seems to be caused when addrlen in sendto() is non-zero, causing 
unix_find_other() to be called instead of unix_peer_get(), which is 
screwing up reference counts.
As for MSG_EOR, apart from the generic socket code, nothing is being done.  
This would be a separate issue.
