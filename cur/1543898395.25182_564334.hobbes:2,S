Yes it is really mmap on flash.  But you are "swapping" pages from RAM
to be mmap'ed on flash.  Also the flash-io complexities are similar to
the block-io layer.  I think "swap on flash" is fair.  Though that
might be confused with making swap work on a NAND flash, which is very
much like the current block-io approach.  "Mmappable swap on flash" is
more exact, I suppose.

Well the obvious route would be to have this management layer use the
MTD, I can't see anything wrong with that.

Interesting.  This idea does allow for swap to be access directly.
