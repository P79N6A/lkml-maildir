I'm considering how disk "bandwidth" use by users may be controlled, and some
coding has been started.  But it's not what may be announced as a
break-through yet.
The main problems are:
 - what to consider as the resource?
   (I'm inclined to account for the time the requests of the given "user" are
   served by the disk)
 - how to ensure an acceptable level of fairness in the case of considerable
   amount of "users" (more precisely, subjects of accounting)?
   I think, the question is not about ensuring bounds on latency, and the
   request order should be determined by dynamic priorities of users in a
   large degree.
