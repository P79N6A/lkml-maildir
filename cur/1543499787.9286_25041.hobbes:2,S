Hi,
I follow up this discussion a while and don't know why there are so many
concerns:
1st: it is a _module_ i.e. It does not bloat the kernel!
2nd: it would help embedded stuff very much
3rd: when you don't need it, don't load the module
It's that simple ;-)
Anyway, it's just another option
Let's finish this guy with a nice implemention and then we'll see if it
is worth including into stock kernel.
