Am I the only person who is completely fascinated by the
effort being spent here micro-optimising something thats
almost never in a path that needs optimising ?
I'd be amazed if any of this masturbation showed the tiniest
blip on a real workload, or even on a benchmark other than
one crafted specifically to test kfree in a loop.
That each occurance of this 'optimisation' also saves a handful
of bytes in generated code is it's only real benefit afaics.
Even then, if a functions cache performance is better off because
we trimmed a few bytes from the tail of a function, I'd be
completely amazed.
I guess April 1st came early this year.
