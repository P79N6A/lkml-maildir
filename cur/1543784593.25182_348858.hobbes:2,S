Well, I found one thing to change. msecs_to_jiffies() deals in unsigned
quantities while the parameter we are passing in is signed (and with
reason). I mistakenly left the
	if (timeout)
check in, when it should be
	if (timeout > 0)
check. Fixed below.
Thanks,
Nish
Description: The current sys_poll() implementation does not seem to
handle large timeouts correctly. Any value in milliseconds (@timeout)
which exceeds the maximum representable jiffy value
(MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT) should result in a MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT
schedule_timeout() request. To achieve this, convert @timeout to jiffies
first, then compare to MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT.
