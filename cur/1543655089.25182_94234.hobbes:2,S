I had this same problem with 2.5.4x in general, and got this very helpful clue
from Rusty Lynch:
The problem is that when Virtual Terminal support is built into the kernel
(not a module) then Input support also needs to be built into the kernel
because it is making function calls that are implemented in the VT section.
To fix this, change the build input support to be built in the kernel instead
of building it as a module.  This can be done from "make xconfig" by
clicking on the "Input device support" on the left, and then change the "Input
devices (needed for keyboard, mouse, ...)" so that it has
a check mark instead of a dot.
Hope this helps.
