Subject: [PATCH 2.6] ext3: fix documentation of online resizing
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Undocument the non-working resize= mount option in ext3, and add some
references to the ext2resize package instead, which appears to be the
only proper way of doing online resizing of ext3 filesystems.

I first thought online resizing was supposed to be done like in JFS
(using mount -o remount,resize=nblocks), and fixed fs/ext3/super.c so
the resize option was recognized properly.  However, the feature
simply didn't work (mount ended up in blocking I/O sleep with nothing
happening), so I assume the option is intentionally disabled.
