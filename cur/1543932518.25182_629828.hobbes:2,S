There's not useful infomation with DEBUG on.
I tested on another machine with kernel 2.6.24-rc2. And the result is
diffrent again.
Here is the result:
1. on 2.6.24-rc2, when I plugin the player the kernel reports below messages:
usb-storage: waiting for device to settle before scanning
/*[lets mark the below part as part 1]*/
scsi 0:0:0:0: Direct-Access                   Newman mp3       PQ: 0 ANSI: 0 CCS

2. on 2.6.24-rc5 kernel reports only the part 1, after try mount the
disk it reports the part 2 and mount the partition as rw
3. on 2.6.24-rc5 kernel reports only the part 1, after try mount the
disk it just mount the partition as ro with nothing more messages.
