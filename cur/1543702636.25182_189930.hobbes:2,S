This is apparently a known problem and has existed for a long time,
but no-one has fixed it for some reason. I asked the exacly same
question a few months ago, and someone told me that this issue has
been around forever, but is noticed under 2.6, since it is less
verbose during the compilation. I'll pass the message that was told
to me: If you've got a fix, it would surely be included in the kernel.
