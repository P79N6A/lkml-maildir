Jeff, this is a non-issue.
These arrays you talk about are removed in a simple edit session -
I did it a handful of times - there is no problem there whatsoever.
What you are talking about is kernel-internal. We are free to do
whatever we like inside the kernel, and we have full information.
The only question is how to transmit device identity across the
kernel space/user space boundary.

[And my solution is to use cookies - 64-bit opaque numbers that
carry no information, and are generated at random by the kernel,
but with the properties: (i) things that have a device number
today keep this number, (ii) the random generation is such that
whenever possible chances are good that after a reboot the same
device will have the same number.]
