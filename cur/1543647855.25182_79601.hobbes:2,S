Subject: Known problem in 2.5.42 with IO-APIC and VIA KT400/VT8235?

Hi,
if I enable CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC in 2.5.42 with ASUS A7V8X
motherboard using VIA KT400 northbridge and VT8235 southbridge, the
kernel freezes right after uncompressing without printing
anything. Just turning off this option makes it boot correctly. The
BIOS has option to use PIC or APIC and is set to APIC. MPS version
can not be set.
The same option "works" in 2.4.20-pre10, ie. it doesn't crash, but
doesn't use APIC IRQs either.
Is this a known problem? Any ideas on how to debug this?
