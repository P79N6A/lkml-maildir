RAM lets through more than 33MB/s... 
Why don't you use bonnie for your benchmarks? (writes&reads to a file of
up to 2GB with different strategies (per char (large cpu overhead), per
block (small cpu overhead)), and it does seeks as a benchmark.
Though probably even bonnie can be improved, it's much better than hdparm
for quick tests.
