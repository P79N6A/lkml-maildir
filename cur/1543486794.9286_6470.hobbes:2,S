I wrote a driver using kernel threads. 
Linking it static to the kernel it runs fine,
compiling it as module, the insmod doesn't terminate while the created threads run.
I haven't found any documentation on kernel_threads, maybe the flags which 
I have set to 0 does what I need.
Where can I found more on kernel_threads, ore is there no way to separate them 
from each other?
TIA
Vasili
