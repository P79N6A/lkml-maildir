	Ive been planning to post something about my problems with the tcp
SACK option, but haven't gotten around too it, partly because of an
overwhelming uninterest in a previous post on the subject on linux-net
I made:)
	In short, I haven't been able to find any computer that supports the
SACK option out there in the world that when the option is actually
used, works. At first I thought it was a broken sun implementation or
something, because my machine seemed to be doing the right thing, but
recently I had the same exact problems with ftp.redhat.com. (Im assuming
thats running linux, so even linux to linux its not working.)
	Thus I generally run with the tcp_sack option off.
	Why do I have problems? Well, because of an incompatibility with my
isp and my modem, I have to run with modem error correction off. This
virtually guarantees a dropped packet on a sufficiently large download,
and if SACK is enabled, it will trigger the use of this tcp option. I
can also get it to drop a packet by jiggling the phone hook, if I want
to force the issue:) In further testing, I was completely unable to
cause SACK to occur with my ether-network. (disconnecting the cables, 
playing with the terminator resistor, etc.) So, I only have seen my problems
with PPP.
	What, you may ask, are my problems? Well, before I post mind numbing
anotated tcpdumps, I would really like someone to contact me that would
be interested in helping with this problem. Ive read through the tcp code,
but couldnt see what _might_ be wrong....
	In short, if Im doing an ftp download, I miss a dropped packet at some
point. Then I start SACK'ing the subsequent packets. Eventually, the
other side has to go back and fill in the missing packet, but it sends
the packet _before_ the one Im missing-- it sends a packet Ive been ACKing
as received the entire time the SACK option is being used. I of course,
ACK this packet, and maintain my SACK options. It sends the same packet again.
Repeat endlessly.
	This is not a hardware problem, and it always, and only occurs when the
tcp_sack option is enabled. I am willing to work with anyone to figure out
what could be causing my problems.
