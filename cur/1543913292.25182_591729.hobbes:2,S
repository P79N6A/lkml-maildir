Ulrich,
For man-pages-2.66, I have added the following documentation in
the open.2 man page for the new-in-2.6.23 O_CLOEXEC.
    O_CLOEXEC (Since Linux 2.6.23)
          Enable   the  close-on-exec  flag  for  the  new  file
          descriptor.  This is useful in multithreaded  programs
          since  using  a separate fcntl(2) F_SETFD operation to
          set the FD_CLOEXEC flag does not suffice to avoid race
          conditions  in multithreaded programs where one thread
          opens a file descriptor at the same  time  as  another
          thread does a fork(2) plus execve(2).
For the recv.2 I added the analogous:
    MSG_CMSG_CLOEXEC (recvmsg() only; since Linux 2.6.23)
         Set  the  close-on-exec  flag  for the file descriptor
         received via a Unix domain file descriptor  using  the
         SCM_RIGHTS  operation  (described  in  unix(7)).  This
         flag is useful for the same reasons as  the  O_CLOEXEC
         flag of open(2).
Please let me know if these changes are correct and complete.
Cheers,
Michael
