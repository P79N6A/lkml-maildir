Hi Andrew!
With 2.6.7-mm6 my laptop stops working completely. Ooops while booting.
Reverting
- usb-locking-fix.patch
- bk-usb.patch
makes it work.
Yre you interested in the output of the kernel oops? I could recompile
the `bad' kernel and copy the Oops by hand from the screen.
BTW: With 2.6.7-mm6 my synaptics touchpad is not recognized anymore at
boot time from the driver. Is this done somewhere in the usb stuff?
And X does not start because it cannot find the synaptics stuff. Have
there been any changes in this area?
Best wishes
Norbert
