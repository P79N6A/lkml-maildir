On x86_64 would have ZONE_DMA, ZONE_DMA32, ZONE_NORMAL, ZONE_HIGHMEM and
ZONE_MOVABLE. On SMP, that's more than two bits worth and would fail t
runtime. Well, it should at least I didn't actually try it out.
However, I accept that the SMP check is less than than ideal. I considered
comparing it against MAX_NR_ZONES but as it's an enum, it can't be checked
at compile time. What else would make a better check?
