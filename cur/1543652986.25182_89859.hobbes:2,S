I encorage this view.  Normally bad things happen when this rule is
not followed in userland.  But the kernel can bend the rules a bit.

The ia64 code you have isn't going to be reliable until the
other points I mentioned wrt section and common symbol sorting
are done.  What you have will work until there's a large 
variable (32k for alpha/mips, 1MB for ia64) in the data area.

I guess this is where I say "patch for what"?  Do I have some
amount of buy-in for the shared library approach, or do I start
adding lots of code to your .o linker?
I guess I could work up a proof-of-concept patch for the former
and see what people think...
