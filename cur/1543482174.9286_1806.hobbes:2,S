Yes, I know that's true _now_.  It wasn't before.  I'm not using the
semaphore like a mutex; I'm trying to use it like a semaphore.
It's all very well having recursive muteces, but I don't see how recursive
semaphores - used like semaphores - make sense.
All I want is a primitive that I can use to count and wait for events.
Semaphores used to do that, before they became recursive.  Now my code is
broken, and I'm not sure what the correct fix is.

Yes, that is what is supposed to happen, and what used to happen.
How would you modify the code so that it works again?
Tim.
