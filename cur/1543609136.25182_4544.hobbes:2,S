Sorry if I upset you. My point was not to criticize your driver, I'm a
happy aic7xxx user.
I've used your drivers with three cards, all recent, and for each the
timeout seems oversized. I was convinced it was to support old hardware.
You seems to indicate that it depends more on the attached scsi targets,
and I believe it but I have never seen this kind of configuration where
the timeout needs to be 15000 Msec. Is this a so common config to set
this value as default ?
