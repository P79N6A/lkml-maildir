good, thanks for the report.
BTW, if you upgrade to 2.4.4pre4 you can apply those two patches:
	
ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.4pre4aa1/00_alpha-numa-4
	
ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.4pre4aa1/00_rwsem-generic-6
really the first is not necessary anymore unless you're using a wildfire. The
second also resurrect the optimized rwsemaphores for all archs but alpha and
ia32.
