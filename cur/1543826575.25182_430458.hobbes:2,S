This *looks* like maybe the drive reported a sector read error,
and the standard "fail the whole request one block at a time"
error mechanism from sd.c has kicked in.
I have a patch to fix this behaviour (in sd.c), but it has not yet
been decided whether to go upstream with it or not.
The same behaviour bites anything from libata as well,
and possibly also (not verified) firewire drives.
Cheers
