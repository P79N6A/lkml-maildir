Hi!
I fully disagree with you opinion.
   1. Adrian sent this patches to the LKML _and_ to their maintainers.
      So the patches can be proved by 2 instances and not Adrian has to
      do this (of course he has to filter non-sense patches (I   think
      he did so)).
   2. I don't know in which case NULL pointers are usefull, but it seems
      they're.
   3. Not only Maintainers have knowledge about the driver and can
      decide whether a patch is useful or not (this hierarchical
      structure is outdated (it's adapeted from the middle ages and a
      reason why many developers (like me) don't want to waste their
      time on fixing little Kernel bugs (in most cases you have to
      resend your patch several times to get it appllied))). This only
      elongates the development time and is not necessary because as
      mentioned above it's sent to the LKML and the maintainers have
      subscribed the LKML and can give their comment here and not in a
      private discussion.
Because of this I recommend everybody to use such tools and sent such 
patches, increasing the quality of the source and fixing problems like 
the problems Adrians patches fix, to the LKML.
