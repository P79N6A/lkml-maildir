 Hi Pierrie, 
 Thanks for writing back.

:     This might trade us one problem for another. Could you try the following:
: 
:     } while (!(cmd.resp[0] & R1_READY_FOR_DATA) || (R1_CURRENT_STATE(cmd.resp[0]) == 7));
:
: 
:     This should also work for cards that mishandle the state field, and if the card jumps to
:     some odd state for some reason.

:     You do. But don't be too alarmed, that is unfortunately the norm. :/

 I have purchased 4 Transcend cards, and all of them behave the 
 same way.  Just wondering why others dont have this problem, and 
 why such a fix hasn't made it to main tree yet.
 I have tried the fix, and it works fine.  Thanks.
 Roopesh.
