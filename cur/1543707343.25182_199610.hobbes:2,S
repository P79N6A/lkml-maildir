ooh, I see you have a mkfs.ufs there.  Does it support UFS1 as well?
Does current UFS support little-endian machines?  If so, has this code been
tested on a little-endian host?  The code _looks_ OK, but one does need to
test...
Has the patched filesystem been regression tested against a UFS1 filesystem?
The patches which you have there are a bit of a disaster coding-style wise.
- Use hard tabs everywhere, not eight-spaces.
- No space before terminating semicolons

  should be

  etcetera.   See Documentation/CodingStyle.
Thanks.
