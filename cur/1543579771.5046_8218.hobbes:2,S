    mmm ... Basically dirty page logic for user space....
mprotect the page(s) you are interested in so you can't write to them
and catch SEGV -- when someone attempts to write you can pull apart
the stack frame mark the page(s) RO and continue.
if you are really stuck i think i have example code to do this
somewhere for ia32 (stack frame is arch. dependent)
