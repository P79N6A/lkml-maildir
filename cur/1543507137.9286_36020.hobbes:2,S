Well, a very nice fellow at IBM Web Library
(
http://weblib.mainz.ibm.com:8080/go/weblib/Welcome.html
) sent me an
electronic copy of the IBM Local Area Network Technical Reference.  It's
kind of old (Dec. 1990) but it describes wire-level NetBEUI, info I
haven't found anywhere else.  Features have been added since then, but I
think this'll do to get a basic implementation going.
They are copyrighted, so I seriously doubt I could simply make the docs
available, but the first thing I intend to do is summarize it into a
simple spec.  I don't have a clue how to implement a LAN protocol in
Linux, but I'll see what I can do.
I remember NetBEUI coming up occasionally here.  If you have any interest,
skills or info, feel free to contact me.  I'll announce when I have useful
info up.
NetBEUI is waning in popularity, but it is a fast protocol and, like IPX,
useful in legacy environments.  Like DLC, it's commonly used for network
printers.
