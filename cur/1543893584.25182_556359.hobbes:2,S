Ah ..ok. Should have realized it earlier. Thanks for the education, but:

Isn't that biasing the overall cpu load to be dependent on SCHED_NORMAL
task load (afaics update_curr_rt doesn't update fair_clock at all)?
What if a CPU had just real-time tasks and no SCHED_NORMAL/BATCH tasks? 
Would the cpu_load be seen to be very low?
[ Dmitry's proposal for a per-class update_load() callback seems to be a
good thing in this regard ]

sure .. i would love to hear their feedback as well on the overall
approach of these patches, which is:
1. Using Paul Menage's process container patches as the basis of
   task-grouping functionaility. I think there is enough consensus
   on this already
(more importantly)
2. Using CFS core to achieve fairness at higher hierarchical levels
   (including at a container level). It would be nice to reuse much
   of the CFS logic which is driving fairness between tasks currently.
3. Using smpnice mechanism for SMP load-balance between CPUs
   (also largely based on what is there currently in CFS). Basic idea behind 
   this is described at
