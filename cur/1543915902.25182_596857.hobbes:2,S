Hmmm.. You are not keeping up with things? Heard of virtual compound 
pages? They only require a vmap when the page allocator fails a 
larger order allocation (which we have established is rare to the point 
of nonexistence). The next rev of large blocksize will use that for 
fallback. Plus vcompounds can be used to get rid of most uses of vmalloc 
reducing the need for virtual mapping in general.
Largeblock is a general solution for managing large data sets using a 
single page struct. See the original message that started this thread. It 
can be used for various other subsystems like vcompound can.
