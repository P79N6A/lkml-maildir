That disable you talk about is bloat. It also trashes the performance of
PIV boxes. In fact I checked out of interest - the disable hack
currently being used is adding *over* 300 bytes to my kernel as its
inlined repeatedly. So its larger, and it ruins performance for all
processors.
You also need it for userspace prefetch fault fixup for a kernel without
CONFIG_MK7 to run stuff perfectly on Athlon.
