I missed the beginning of the thread, sorry if that question was
already answered,
What about all the code that still consider kmalloc'ed memory is
safe for use with virt_to_bus and friends and is contiguous
physically for DMA ? In some cases (non-PCI devices, embedded
platforms, etc...), the pci_consistent API is not an option.
That means that __GFP_VMALLOC can't be part of GFP_KERNEL or
many driver will break in horrible ways (random memory corruption).
Ben.
