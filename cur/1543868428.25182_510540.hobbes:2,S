Actually, it isn't even related to SCSI transport; it is related to the
request_queue interface.  Even for devices which don't use a SCSI
transport, the request_queue code limits transfer lengths to max_sectors.

I take back that last sentence.  If the reserved size was smaller than 
max_sectors then nothing would be changed.

Well, if Doug wants to reduce the value returned by SG_GET_RESERVED_SIZE, 
it's okay with me.  An advantage of doing this is that older versions of 
cdrecord would then work correctly.
However you don't seem to realize that people can use programs like
cdrecord with devices whose drivers don't support SG_GET_RESERVED_SIZE --
because that ioctl works only with sg.  Programs would have to try
SG_GET_RESERVED_SIZE and if it faied, then try BLKSECTGET.
Remember also, the "reserved size" is _not_ the maximum allowed size of a
DMA transfer.  Rather, it is the size of an internal buffer maintained by
sg.  It's legal to do an I/O transfer larger than the "reserved size", but 
it is not legal to do an I/O transfer larger than max_sectors.
