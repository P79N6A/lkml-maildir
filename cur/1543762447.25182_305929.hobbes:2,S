It won't be a no-op. I have tested it. It works well.
I pressed sysrq-f, loging bash got killed and I had to re-login.

I don't think schedule_work() is a good option here.  Since sysrq-f is emergent,
we just let oom-killer send SIGKILL in interrupt context and return.
We needn't send SIGKILL in a process context. That'll be slow and [events] may got delayed.
