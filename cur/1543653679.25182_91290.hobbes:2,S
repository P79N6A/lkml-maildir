Well, I was only -j64. Thats 2 processes per-cpu... something unusual
seems to happen with low process/cpu density. Some fiddling around with
prior kernels seemed to show that both -j64 and -j256 were previously
near-equivalent sweet spots for 32x.

The unusual bit that neither of those can really address was that
eating a single cpu with something completely unrelated sped the whole
process up from 48s to 36s on 32x (this is all nicely repeatable). No
good explanations for this have surfaced yet. I'll have to get a good
way of logging what processes are chewing how much cpu and what cpus
they're running on before I can send comprehensible traces of this.
OTOH Focht's fork() and/or exec() -time load balancing should
significantly help the low process/cpu density case by creating an
opportunity for load balancing before the lifetime of short-lived
processes expires, with the added bonus of keeping things within
nodes most of the time.
Thanks,
Bill
