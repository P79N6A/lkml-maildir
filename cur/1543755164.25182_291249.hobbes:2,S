That actually looks okay. Perhaps battery now stores more energy than
it did last time. Different temperature or something. I'd not worry
about this one.
I have machine where last full capacity is quite a bit bigger than
design capacity; and that's okay, too.
Heh, but your battery gives 2V more than design voltage. That is
slightly "interesting". Perhaps your voltage sensor is wrong and
that's why remaining capacity is so high... Or perhaps your battery is
slightly better than it should be.
