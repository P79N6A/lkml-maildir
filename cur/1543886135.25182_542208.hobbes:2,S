That might be appropriate for a similar problem on CD-ROM
filesystems. (when the CD is rockridge KOI8 and you want UTF-8)
It may even be appropriate for Joliet, though 8.3 may be
the better choice in that case.
It's not appropriate for vfat, HPFS, JFS, or NTFS. All of those
have built-in support for 8.3 aliases. Normally the 8.3 names
are like hidden hard links, except that deletion of either name
will wipe out the other. (same as case differences too)
So the names are there, and they should already work.
They just need to be reported for directory listings when the
long names would be too long.
