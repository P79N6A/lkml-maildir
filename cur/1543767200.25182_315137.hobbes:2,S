Sure. We're not talking about inventing new user interfaces here. Just
how best to support the existing ones.

I think what the IETF NFS working group rather needs right now is an
advocate that is willing to stand up and demonstrate why protocol
support for inotify-style callbacks would be a more scalable solution
than a solution based on a combination of GETATTR polling and read
delegations (essentially the same thing as CIFS' op-locks) for
directories.
The current research (see
http://www3.ietf.org/proceedings/05mar/slides/nfsv4-4/sld1.htm
) which
has uses real-life on-the-wire traffic actually leans more towards the
GETATTR solution. That research was based on a set of anonymous tcpdump
traces taken at Harvard University, though, so it reflects the traffic
in a typical university environment. It may be that other use-cases
exist that favour the inotify callbacks case.
If so, now is the time to step forward and say so...
Cheers,
