I just made a driver for a couple of serial A/Ds that runs at 2kHz on a
StrongARM platform. The system doesn't have any problems to keep up
with that frequency, so I think 4kHz would still be OK.

That's no problem, most of the embedded drivers never do.

Forget about C++ for kernel programming, it simply doesn't work (see
the lkml FAQ at 
http://www.tux.org/lkml/
 ). A nice starting point for
kernel programming is 
http://www.kernelnewbies.org/
 together with its
IRC channel #kernelnewbies. Also get a copy of the book "Linux device
drivers (2nd edition)", there is a link in the books section on the
kernelnewbies website.

I don't know if Linux is the *ideal* platform, but driving a plotter
could certainly be done in Linux.
