That's what I just said, if they  bother to add the extra header, they could
just as well fake the envelope from  to point to some yahoo account, without
needing to set the said header.

In exim 3 yes, in exim 4, you can do what I explained
(sorry, I should have been specific about which version)
Details on the exim-users list if needed.

Caching is indeed the number 1 solution, a BL

1) exim callbacks are _not_ spam filters, they almost garantee that you only
   accept mail that you can reply to and/or bounce. If your envelope from
   points to  foohost.domain.tld with some non  routable IP, my only  way to
   tell you that I won't be able to  send you bounces is to refuse your mail
   at SMTP time.
   If you send mail from a non existant account (by mistake), same thing.
   SMTP callbacks just happen to also catch a lot of badly formatted spam,
   but that's not their main goal
2) There aren't many ways you can cause exim callbacks to fail without
   refusing real mail.
   (you can look at the callback rate in your logs and block the IPs, that's
   about it)
