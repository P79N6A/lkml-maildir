I've read that too quickly, sorry. What then all that clean scripts
are for?

So, just to protect script from itself or similar one, here's update
(only for those, who's interested, of course).
-*- clean-whitespace.sh -*-
#!/bin/sh -e
# stdin/stdout
IFS=''
t="`printf '\t'`" ; s=' ' ; s7='       ' ; w79=79 ;
case $0 in *diff* | *patch*) p='+' ; s='';; esac
while read line
do case "$line" in
   ++*) echo "$line";;
   $p*) line="`echo \"$line\" | expand`"
	[ ${#line} -gt $w79 ] && : ${long:=line}
	echo "$line" | sed "/^$p/{s_ *\$__;s_^$p$s7${s}_$p${t}_;s_$s7 _${t}_g}"
	;;
     *) echo "$line";;
   esac
done
[ -n "$long" ] && echo "at least one line, wider than $w79 chars, found" 1>&2
