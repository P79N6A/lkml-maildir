linux/lib/crc32table.h : crc32table_le[] is the same as our crc_32_tab[].
This looks like a standard that's not going to change, as you've said, so
including crc32table.h and getting rid of our own table would work fine.
Do we go a step beyond this and use say the crc32() function from
linux/crc32.h?  Is this _function_ as standard and unchanging as the table
of crcs?  In my tests it doesn't produce the same results as our
gfs2_disk_hash() function, even with both using the same crc table.  I
don't mind adopting a new function and just writing a user space
equivalent for the tools if it's a fixed standard.
