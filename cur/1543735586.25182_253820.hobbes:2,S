I think I might be experiencing the same problem here with dual-p3
1.4GHz PE2550 boxes without PERC. We have a bunch of them doing SMTP
and webmail and every now and then one of them freezes for no
apparent reason. I don't get _anything_ on the console and nothing in
the logs.  Haven't tried serial console though.
This isn't a big problem for me since this happens randomly about
every 9 weeks or so. Since the boxes are in redundant pairs I've just
shrugged it off as being a general case of piece-of-crap PC hardware.
I just thought I should add my two cents' worth...
I've gone through kernels 2.4.16 to 2.4.26 with and without various
patches and nothing seems to make a difference.
