Having pulled the latest snapshot, it's good to see that
remap_pfn_range has cleaned things up a bit. However, it doesn't
solve our problem.
In arch xen we need to use a different function for mapping MMIO
or BIOS pages, which is the /dev/mem behaviour we need to
support.
I'm not sure we can do this without changing the call in mem.c,
at least not without adding an extra hook inside remap_pfn_range
that allows us to use an alternative to set_pte e.g. slow_set_pte
that tries to figure out whether the pfn is real memory or
not. Personally I think the mem.c #ifdef is cleaner and more
robust. 
I'm not sure I understand the issue about io_remap_page_range
having an architecture-specific calling convention. Please can
you enlighten me.
Thanks,
Ian
