another problem with TPR-based IRQ routing (in addition to the ones i
mentioned in the previous mail) is that if you 'deny' certain IRQs via the
TPR, then if all CPUs run kernel-intensive jobs, then IRQs will never be
served by any of the CPUs (or will be served only after a long latency).  
Sure, this can be hacked around, but if gets ugly very fast and doesnt get
us very far. All in one, i found the TPR to be not flexible enough for
what we really want: good IRQ distribution and good IRQ affinity at once.
