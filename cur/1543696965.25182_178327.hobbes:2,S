I have a similar problem: With 2.4.22-ac3 I had 37mb/sec with my Samsung 
HD and 49MB/sec with IBM/Hitachi, now with 2.6 (all I tried, including 
test9-mm2) I had only 20mb/sec for Samsung and about 39mb/sec for the 
IBM. Motherboard is Abit NF7-S Rev2.0, as well, so same situation with 
the siimage 1.06 driver. I wanted to run some dd tests as well, but it 
is a real performance hit. Playing with readahead or other hdparm 
options didn't help either.
