Hello,
Since I removed this from the main text:

I thought it would be appropriate to add it to the older (<2.02) boot
protocols specific notes.
>+       The kernel command line *must* be 256 bytes including the

I've removed the 256 limit from the 2.02 boot protocol since grub and
lilo guys did not understand the comment: "a boot loader may allow a
longer command line to be passed to permit future kernels to extend
this limit.", they both truncate the command-line to 256 (hard coded).
I thought that it best to make clear that the limit on the
command-line length is determined by the kernel and not by the boot
loader.
I can remove the addition.
Best Regards,
Alon Bar-Lev
