No.  Pick the latest driver and use the muxsel_hook.

No.  Have you noticed the bttv-cards.c file?  There is plenty of
card-specific initialization code.  bttv_init_card2() likely is the
proper place.

Sorry, no.  Use the card=foo insmod option and flame the vendor of the
card.

/me.
How about reading documentation?  Documentation/video4linux/bttv/ for
example?
