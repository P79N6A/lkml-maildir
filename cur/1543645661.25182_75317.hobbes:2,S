 You wrote "some of", so I suppose others are OK.  I meant those others. 
Anyway -- is it a new problem?  I can't see it documented in the current
P3 spec update.  That's weird -- Intel might hesitate documenting
weirdnesses of their chips, however they tend to include such simple and
obvious errata in the update.
 The spec actually states the L2 descriptor for the P3 may be as follows:
- 0x43 -- 512kB, unified,
- 0x82 -- 256kB, 8-way set associative,
- 0x83 -- 512kB, 8-way set associative.
The last descriptor is omitted from the list of known types in cache_table
in 2.4.20-pre8 -- could it be the culprit?
