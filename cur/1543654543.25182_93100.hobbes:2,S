I've experienced a similar problem with "linux-2.4.20-rc2-ac3", 
"linux-2.4.20-rc4-ac1" and "linux-2.4.20-ac1". At first I also
thought it's a swap problem, but this seems to be a wrong con-
clusion, too. 
The problem occurs, for example, when Mozilla and RealPlayer are
running and I start to compile something or copy large files. The 
RealPlayer interrupts, the mouse sometimes doesn't move smoothly 
any more, and so on. 
Using "linux-2.4.20" I don't see this behaviour.
I've collected some information when running "linux-2.4.20-ac1" 
and "linux-2.4.20". I've uploaded it to:
  
http://www.uni-ulm.de/~s_smoser/lkml/
The "vmstat"- and "ps"-files were created during the "cp" of about 
2,5 GB of data from one hard disk to the other one. 
Bye,
Steffen
