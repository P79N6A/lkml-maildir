Depends on how you configure it. An enabled encryption doesn't always mean
it has problems taking to other sendmails. This sendmail here has no
problems forwarding a mail > 400 Kb (I used 1.2 MB).
This is 8.11.1 with the MySQL mapper patch.

I can't reproduce on 8.11.1
Maybe I can if someones tells me the exact procedure to reproduce it.
