That much difference?

I tried various things -- none changed the results significantly. In
the end I had both reader and writer doing buf[0]++ figuring and lazy
mappings or something would have to be trigger buy that.

The results are the same -- all I can think of now are hardware
differences. The machines are bot PPro200's -- but perhaps one has
superior memory bandwidth or something?
<pause>
OK, a little fiddling with bw_mem_wr & bw_mem_cp shows the main
memory bandwidth of the linux machine is slightly higher, however,
there is something else going on:
  bw_mem_cp   8k libc aligned	- both very fast
  bw_mem_cw  32k libc aligned	- same speed (both fast)
  bw_mem_cw  64k libc aligned	- FreeBSD is consistently fast (same
				  speed as above) 
				- Linux only gets the same speed as
				  before one some of the time (maybe
				  2/3 times I try this)
  bw_mem_cp 128k libc aligned	- FreeBSD is marginally slower
				  (230M/s vs 245M/s)
				- Linux throughput has gone to shit.
				  100M/s vs 260M/s and with fairly
				  large amounts of variance in this
				  result.
For values much above this both slow down considerably and they spill
completely from L2 cache (both 256k) I assume (actually, even 160K
slows us down plenty which surprises me a little).
It looks to me like either linux is spilling form the L2 cache
earlier that FreeBSD or that lack of page colouring (remember the
PPro cores are only 4-way SA) could be the problem?
Interestingly, for anything that fits in the L1 cache linux is much
faster (558M/s vs 355M/s) than FreeBSD -- a better libc memcpy
perhaps?
