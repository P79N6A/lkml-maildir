Subject: [PATCH for review] [16/145] x86_64: x86 clean up nmi panic messages
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/10/503

From: Don Zickus <dzickus@redhat.com>
Clean up some of the output messages on the nmi error paths to make more
sense when they are displayed.  This is mainly a cosmetic fix and
shouldn't impact any normal code path.
