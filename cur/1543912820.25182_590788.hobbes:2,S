Jiri's patch would have wrongly not only removed the BSD statement from 
dual licenced files but also from not dual licenced files.
This was a mistake in this patch (that was never merged into the tree) 
neither Jiri nor Alan noticed.
The only disagreement is about the following:
Theo claimed boldly in the email that started this thread on 
linux-kernel it would "break the law" to choose one licence for dual 
licenced code like the following:
/*      $OpenBSD: ath.c,v 1.63 2007/05/09 16:41:14 reyk Exp $  */
/*      $NetBSD: ath.c,v 1.37 2004/08/18 21:59:39 dyoung Exp $        */

       "Is there not promise of rain?" Ling Tan asked suddenly out
        of the darkness. There had been need of rain for many days.
       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
