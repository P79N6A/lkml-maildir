Setting netdev_max_backlog doesn't seem to have any effect for me either.
I get a similar latency when I try to reproduce your result above, ~612 
usec. However, my trace is very different than yours:

In fact most any network activity, with the POSSIBLE exception of 
already open connections, seem to be able to trigger higher latencies. 
As you can see here:
