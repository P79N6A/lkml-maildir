Finally bug was triggered again. And guess where it was? It was in
ppp_async_encode.
ppp device ppp1: tpkt set to NULL at point 4
It seems that we have one instance of ppp_tty_wakeup called from
do_serial_bh, and other one from rs_flush_buffer.
I've seen patches on the list to ppp code to check whenether
is other ppp_tty_wakeup running.
My aproach is different. I propose to call ldisc functions only once from
tty layer, this way we don't hurt ppp and other ldisc things,
and have all non SMP safe things in ldisc code fixed.
After all it is does not make sence to call ldisc.write_wakeup on the tty,
if another instance of it is already running on the same tty.
E.g. folowing patch fixes not only ppp, but also SLIP, without even
touching SLIP & PPP code.
