On x86, the BIOS led state can be read from byte 0x97 the BIOS RAM. The
BIOS RAM is mapped at 0x400 so all we need to do is to one byte from
RAM (offset 0x497). This is how Suse's hwinfo does.
But maybe the first question to ask is: why is the BIOS setting lost in
the first place? Why is the kernel resetting the led state?
