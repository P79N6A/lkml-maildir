Popping up a box saying "Is your device broken?" isn't good UI.

No. But given a choice between working hardware or marginally better 
runtime PM, they're going to choose working hardware.

This patch is exactly that - a way of getting most of the benefits of 
autosuspend without any real probability of breaking hardware. If you 
mean "Are the distributions willing to pop up dialogs asking users to 
start caring about obscure aspects of the USB spec", then I don't think 
that's actually making things better.

I'm speaking as part of the Ubuntu kernel team, and I've been discussing 
this with Fedora people.

You commonly run a laptop off battery while having a printer plugged in?
