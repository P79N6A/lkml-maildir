If the VCC pin is connected to 0 V, the "pullup" will pull down to 0 V.
If the controller reverses it's logic while VCC=0, it might work.
The controller might alternatively switch all pins (except the pullup) to
VCC, which would look to the card like switching all pins to 0V, but
detection by pullup would still work.
