Noted (queued)...  fine by me, and makes life easier.

hmmmmm.  We'll see how it plays out...  on the remove side, the above is 
exact what happens in gdth_remove_one() without my patch, thus 
consolidating two cases of the same code into one.  There is a 
less-strong argument for doing the allocation that way, but it may turn 
out to be useful anyway once the ISA/EISA API conversion is complete.
