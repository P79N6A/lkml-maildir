Subject: select() clobbering the timeout

I recently came across something strange on one Linux server: select()
calls that time out suddenly started clobbering the timeout value with
garbage. 
This is a UP P-II running kernel 2.0.35, with an uptime of 254 days.
It's also a production server, and it's otherwise running fine.  The
weird behavior only started 5 days ago, and we only noticed it because
it made zsh appear to hang.  
Now it's predictable: a test program shows that select() clobbers the
timeout value everytime the timeout expires, but not when it returns
early (because of input or a singal).  I've single-stepped through the
disassembly of select() in libc, and it appears clearly that the
clobbering must happen in the kernel itself.   I can't reproduce it on
any other kernel, but then again, that 2.0.35 took 8 months to start
doing it.
I'm posting this not to ask for a fix, but just in case someone gets
inspired to look at it, or can quickly say "that got fixed in 2.0.36" or
whatever ...
Here's some test code:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <unistd.h>
void catchasignal() { }
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  struct timeval tv;
  fd_set s;
  signal(SIGINT, catchasignal);
  tv.tv_sec = atoi(argv[1]);
  tv.tv_usec = atoi(argv[2]);
  FD_ZERO(&s);
  FD_SET(0, &s);
  printf("tv_sec = %ld, tv_usec = %ld\n", (long)tv.tv_sec, (long)tv.tv_usec);
  select(1, &s, NULL, NULL, &tv);
  printf("tv_sec = %ld, tv_usec = %ld\n", (long)tv.tv_sec, (long)tv.tv_usec);
  return 0;
}
and its output on the misbehaving kernel:
$ ./mintest 0 1000
tv_sec = 0, tv_usec = 1000
tv_sec = 20936492, tv_usec = 650000
$ ./mintest 1 0
tv_sec = 1, tv_usec = 0
tv_sec = 20936484, tv_usec = 550000
$ ./mintest 2 0
tv_sec = 2, tv_usec = 0
^C
tv_sec = 1, tv_usec = 570000
