Don't do that (tm).  You may still have that problem (or even all filesystems
being mounted wrong) if you add a new drive to a SCSI chain.  Likewise if
you add an IDE controller, the controllers may be numbered differently...

If you use a UUID, you will never have conflicts (unless you do drive
imaging, which is bad).  The label is just a lot more convenient to use
than the UUID.

It will pick the first one found, I guess.  However, this still reduces
the problem of drive renaming by 99%.  It goes from "each time drives
are added/moved/removed my system may be broken" to "if I insert two
drives with the same label 50% chance my system is broken".  I'll take
the latter any day.
Cheers, Andreas
