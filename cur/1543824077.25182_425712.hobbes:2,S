The buffers are buffercache rather than the usual pagecache; due to
nbd I guess. Buffercache cannot be satisfied by highmem.
This would be a relatively uncommon setup, which explains why it
isn't working 100%. I don't know of any reason why reclaim speed
should be worse for buffercache, however one notable thing will be
that zone_normal's lowmem reserve that is untouchable by pagecache
will be eaten by buffercache...
Anyway, increasing /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes should help. Janos,
perhaps you could try doubling it and see how you go?
