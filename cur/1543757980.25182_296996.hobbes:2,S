I have tested with ext2. I get double faults when trying to sync.
What are those? (By the look of the error message, I can see they are 
not something I want to have :-)
I'm at loss how all of this can happend. All I do is to allocate BIOs 
and kernel memory, process the BIOs and deal with deallocation afterwards.
