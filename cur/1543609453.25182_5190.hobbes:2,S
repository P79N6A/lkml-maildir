Hello,
Sorry, that last email escaped from me before I was done.  :-)
Anyway, I was fooling around with disabling the BIOS on my PDC20265
Promise Ultra100 PCI card, to speed up my booting.  When I did that, the
pdc202xx driver only configures the chipset for mdma2, not for udma5.  
Poking around a bit, I discovered that the CONFIG_PDC202XX_BURST option
does exactly what I need--it tells the pdc202xx driver to configure the
chipset for UDMA regardless of how it found it.
So here is an updated Configure.help entry that makes it clearer what
CONFIG_PDC202XX_BURST does.
Cheers,
Wayne

 Special UDMA Feature
 CONFIG_PDC202XX_BURST
-  For PDC20246, PDC20262, PDC20265 and PDC20267 Ultra DMA chipsets.
-  Designed originally for PDC20246/Ultra33 that has BIOS setup
-  failures when using 3 or more cards.
+  This option causes the pdc202xx driver to enable UDMA modes on the
+  PDC202xx even when the PDC202xx BIOS has not done so.
 
-  Unknown for PDC20265/PDC20267 Ultra DMA 100.
+  It was originally designed for the PDC20246/Ultra33, whose BIOS will
+  only setup UDMA on the first two PDC20246 cards.  It has also been
+  used succesfully on a PDC20265/Ultra100, allowing use of UDMA modes
+  when the PDC20265 BIOS has been disabled (for faster boot up).
