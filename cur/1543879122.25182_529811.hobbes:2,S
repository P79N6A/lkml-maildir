I was not speaking about locks.

What I meant is : You falsely speak of 'PROCESS performance statistics'.
Your implementation only cares about threads, not processes.
There is a slight difference, that getrusage() can do.
So if you do "cat /proc/PID/status", you'll get counters not for the PROCESS, 
only the main thread of the process.
If you want an analogy, imagine a "ps aux" that doesnt show the cpu time of 
all threads of a process, but only the cpu time of the main thread. Quite 
meaningless isnt it ?
So either :
1) You change all your description to mention 'thread' instead of 'process'.
2) You change your implementation to match your claim.
