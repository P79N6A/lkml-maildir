I know but those programs sometimes ship with distros. How many distros do
not ship with either Xfree86 nor Xorg ?

Arjan proposed to add a __must_check on the set*uid() function in glibc.
I think that if killing the program is what makes you nervous, we could
at least print a warning in the kernel logs so that the admin of a machine
being abused has a chance to detect what's going on. Would you accept
