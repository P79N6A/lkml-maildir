Me either.  Look in /sys/class/mem/  Is it full of symlinks or real
directories?
If symlinks, your version of udev should be able to handle it properly,
but might have a bug somehow.
Try running udevmonitor and echo a "1" to /sys/class/mem/mem/uevent and
see if udev creates the device properly or not.
