The interrupt stack needs to be non-paged. Are you sure the user-stacks
need to be 'physical', non-paged too? If so, that's probably the
problem. All addresses accessed by the CPUs in the kernel are virtual
which means one needs some mapping anyway.
So, why can't one map non-contiguous pages into the kernel-user-stack?
That entry-into-the-kernel stack is the one that's giving everybody
fits because it needs to remain allocated, even for sleeping tasks.
If it was virtual, built just like other data, it could be made up
from any available RAM and, in the case of a preemptive kernel,
even swapped!
In that case, the total amount of real RAM you actually need
is defined only by the number of concurrent tasks in a preemptive
kernel, plus the page(s) for the interrupt stack. That's far lower
than the 'N' pages times everybody who forked and slept, which is
what we seem to have now.
FYI, there is nothing wrong with a 2-level stack, i.e., the
system-call occurs on the interrupt stack, then the user-kernel
stack gets allocated from paged RAM.
Now I know this isn't VMS, but in VMS we didn't have anything
that really needed to be contiguous except for the interrupt
stack (which was arbitrarily 64k). And on VAXen the pages were
tiny 512 things so you really need to use paged RAM for just
about everything.
