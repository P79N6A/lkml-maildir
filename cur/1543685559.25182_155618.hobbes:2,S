And that is the conclusion I think. Kids should be encouraged to listen,
watch, read in english. Discouraged to watch dubbed movies. My 6 years old
neice is totally transparent to languages. If she hears something in
english, that's fine, she even repeats the words and frases. If she hears
in japanesse (i showed her anime) that's fine also. Hmm. I am no
child-schrink-wannabe but, if we just encourage kids to be open to every
language, they will just click to the ones they fancy.
