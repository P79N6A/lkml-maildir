I'm quite sure that this patch is in my tree, as I have that "u8 *instr 
= a->instr;" in apply_alternatives, and it seems that this one was added 
by checkin you mention...  My tree was synced up to:

which as far as I can tell really *is* after your fix.  I'm quite sure 
that I did not hit any BUG_ON() or anything like that - when patching 
got to memcpy alternative, it entered text_poke(), and instead of 
returning to caller it returned to BIOS :-(

It does not actually change two bytes - it changes two bytes now because 
alternative is two bytes long - it makes no sense to replace whole 
function with NOPs - it is necessary when you fall through that 
function, but for this (and other x86-64 alternatives) it makes no sense 
to replace whole function with nops if first instruction in alternative 
is jump - then you need to only put that jump in place.
