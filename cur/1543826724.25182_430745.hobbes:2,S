This seems to be one of the serial bits for the ip3106 which must have
been lost on the way to kernel.org.  Unfortunately the original author
does no longer take care of the code.  I just took a stab at the PNX8550
code and it has a significant number of other problems.  All small in
the sum large enough such that I will mark PNX8550 support broken.

[MIPS] Mark PNX8550 support broken.
Broken in too many way for me to fix it for 2.6.17.
