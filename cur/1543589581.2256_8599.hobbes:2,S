Hi,
Is this I2O implementation supporting PCI devices ?
Yesterday I post something about that, I have a CompactPCI computer with 2
computers in it. One master and one slave. The slave one, is has a non
transparent pci-to-pci bridge : DEC (INTEL) 21554, wich support I2O
messaging, I want both computer to communicate by this mean, but I cant seam
to be able to make the I2O working, I was trying on 2.2.19 ... but I will
try on 2.4.4. But is there allready a device who is doing this kind of
communication, I would like to look a some code to see how htis I2O is
working. I have looked a some docs, but I didnt find any ... I guess I will
be stuck with reading all the I2O specs from the SIG.
Thank you for your time.
