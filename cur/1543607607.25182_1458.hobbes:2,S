Please note that there have been broken versions of the 1009 BIOS
around. I know one person, and I read from serveral ones, who flashed
1009 to their A7V and were unable to start the computer afterwards.

Apparently ASUS has replaced the broken version with a working one
without updating the version number. But that's just a guess based on
recent success stories about 1009.

As I don't use Windows at all, FreeDOS has proven very useful for 
flashing the bios. (www.freedos.org)
But, of course, no guarantees.
