ALI M1535D pci-ide bridge, isn't it? That's what the specs on
API's webpage seem to indicate.

Try this for fun: dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/null bs=4096, and see if it
cronks out.
In my case, any serious I/O on the IDE drives quickly results in pretty
technicolor on the VGA screen, and then a hard lockup.
Furthermore, after power-reset, 2.4.x, x=0 or 1, cannot successfully fsck
the drives.  It hangs after about the 2nd-3rd partition, again in a hard
lockup.
I have to boot into 2.2.x to fsck the drives, make changes, and reboot to
hang the system.
My WAG is that there are problems in the ALI driver.

AIC7xxx controller, just recently started spewing errors very similar to
this -- amongst a host of others, as I was trying to get the UP1100 to use
a generic IDE interface rather than the ALI 15x3.
