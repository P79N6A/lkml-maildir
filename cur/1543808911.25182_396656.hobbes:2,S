Tried. Tried also with setting -t 10 (the medium is 10x), without -p 1 (still
trying fixed packet size, same size). Out of four attempts, all failed.
 ----[snipet]----
# cdrwtool -d /dev/cdrw -q -p 1
using device /dev/cdrw
fixed packets
4690KB internal buffer
setting write speed to 12x
Settings for /dev/cdrw:
        Fixed packets, size 32
        Mode-2 disc
I'm going to do a quick setup of /dev/cdrw. The disc is going to be blanked and
formatted with one big track. All data on the device will be lost!! Press
CTRL-C to cancel now. ENTER to continue.
Initiating quick disc blank
Disc capacity is 295264 blocks (590528KB/576MB)
Formatting track
wait_cmd: Input/output error
Command failed: 04 17 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 - sense 05.64.00
format disc: Illegal seek

DMESG:
cdrom: This disc doesn't have any tracks I recognize!
Please note that although I've been testing packet writing on 2.6.15.1, I'm
performing the initial burning on 2.6.12.1(+ squashfs), I apologize for not
mentioning this.
The udftools are from Debian, in version 1.0.0b3-11.
