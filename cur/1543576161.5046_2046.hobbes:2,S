By the way, I now checked the syslog, and I see that the last cron message
was logged about an hour before I reset the system.  So it looks like a total
lockup.
BTW, what does it mean when this gets logged?
Dec 17 19:01:09 localhost kernel: eth0: Resetting the Tx ring pointer.
Dec 17 19:01:09 localhost kernel: eth0: Tx Ring full, refusing to send
buffer.
