in_atomic() includes a check for preempt_disable() ... that is actually
all it checks (the preempt_count).  So this fix prevents that.
This patch is interesting, though, because if right now we are
scheduling in the middle of per-CPU code there is a bug (regardless of
kernel preemption -- and with kernel preemption off, the in_atomic()
check might return false even though the code is accessing per-processor
data).
So I think what we really want is to just never call this crypto_yield()
thing when in any sort of critical section, which includes any
per-processor data.
