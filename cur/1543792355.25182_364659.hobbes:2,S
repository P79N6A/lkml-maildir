(anything that you do move over will probably exit quickly and put you 
right back where you started)
If you fork without execing a lot, with no hints, and they all exit
quickly, then yes. But I don't think that's a common workload ;-)

That might work, yes. But I'd prefer to see a real workload that
suffers before worrying about it too much. You have something in mind?

I suspect most of those are either inetd (exec's) or multiple servers
that service requests by now. maybe not. Threads might be quicker if
it's heavy anyway ;-)
