 and you can download
What about revision codes?
Vendor and device really isn't enough to identify something.
There may be completely different chips with the same vendor
and device IDs.
Tundra provides an example: Universe, Universe II, Universe IIB
These chips are the same device in some sense; they are all
PCI-to-VME bridges. (damn popular too) The programming interface
is incompatible, so they get different revisions. Tundra isn't
alone in interpreting the PCI spec this way.
