	Congratulations to everyone working to reduce contention of the
Big Kernel Lock. According to this benchmark your work has paid off!
John Hawkes of SGI asked me to Beta test his 2.5.5 version of lockmeter 
last night (that's what I get for asking when it would be out). The results 
were interesting enough to post. 
	All three runs were on an 8-way SMP system running dbench with 
up to 16 clients 10 times each. The results are at 
http://lse.sf.net/locking
 . 
Throughput numbers are not included yet, I need to rerun dbench without 
lockmeter to get accurate throughput results.
(Read down the Con(tention) column)
TOTAL is for the whole system
kernel_flag is for every function holding BKL combined.
