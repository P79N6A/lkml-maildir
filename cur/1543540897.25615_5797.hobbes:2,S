Try 2.2.16 or the latest 2.2.17-pre it may work better for you. If that
fails try the latest 2.4.0-test version.
And if that fails someone has sent a patch for vfat in 2.4.0-test that I
haven't had time to test but that I can forward to you if the
"plain" version does not work.
(but I think that was about it not working properly for 16 bit codepages,
 for cyrillic I assume you are using cp866<->koi8-r and those are both
 8bit so it shouldn't matter).

Hmm. 2.2 vfat does not try to do any case conversion but 2.4 does. Maybe
you should try the 2.4 version first.

Probably. I believe a unicode version of toupper()/tolower() would help
(at least) vfat and ncpfs support "long/short" name conversions. smbfs has
(had, depending on which version you look at) options to convert into
upper/lower that only works for us-ascii ...
