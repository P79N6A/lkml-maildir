Seems like the device is a bit strange - it in fact, as far as my 
understanding goes (see the previous posts in this thread), doesn't have 
any noticeable USB audio capabilities at all - it is just a HID device 
with a few buttons (plus additional audio connector, which only "forwards" 
the sound to a real audio device).
So it's just a trivial HID device with probably a bit strange report 
descriptor, it seems to me. It even has only one interface (the HID one).
