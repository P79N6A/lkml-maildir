Subject: reiser4 bugs in 2.6.21-rc4

There are two bugs I found in current -mm reiser4 code.
1. Some files seem to be zeroed out randomly. Usually it's 
/lib/security/pam_limits.so and /lib/security/pam_deny.so. As 
fsck.reiser4 didn't find anything wrong I decided to create clean 
installation in vmware and see if this bug appears on newly formatted 
partition. It did.
2. Sometimes I get oppses in reiser4_do_readpage_extent. Assert codes 
are vs-1426 and nikita-2688. A patch was posted on namesys list to 
address this problem, but it didn't help.
Kernel: 2.6.21-rc4 with manually applied reiser4 patches from -mm. Arch: 
x86-64
