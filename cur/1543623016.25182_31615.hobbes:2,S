How do you checked it?
Which scsi_info version?
Mine gave only the below info:
SunWave1 /home/nuetzel# scsi_info /dev/sda
SCSI_ID="0,0,0"
MODEL="IBM DDYS-T18350N"
FW_REV="S96H"
SunWave1 /home/nuetzel# scsi_info /dev/sdb
SCSI_ID="0,1,0"
MODEL="IBM DDRS-34560D"
FW_REV="DC1B"
SunWave1 /home/nuetzel# scsi_info /dev/sdc
SCSI_ID="0,2,0"
MODEL="IBM DDRS-34560W"
FW_REV="S71D"
But when I use "scsi-config" I get under "Cache Control Page":
Read cache enabled: Yes
Write cache enabled: No
I've tested it with setting this by hand some months ago, but the speed 
doesn't change in anyway (ReiserFS).

Will test it over the weekend on 2.4.19-pre1aa1 with all Reiserfs 
2.4.18.pending patches applied.
