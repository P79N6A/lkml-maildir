Nick, thanks for the advice.
We use a generation number after each successful branch configuration
command, so that ->d_revalidate later on can discover that change, and
rebuild the union of objects.  At ->remount time, I figured it'd be nice to
"encourage" that revalidation to happen sooner, by invalidating as many
upper pages as possible, thus causing ->d_revalidate/->readpage to take
place sooner.  So we used to call drop_pagecache_sb from our remount code:
it was the only caller of drop_pagecache_sb.  It wasn't too much of an
latency issue to call drop_pagecache_sb there: the VFS remount code path is
already pretty slow (dropping temporarily to readonly mode, and dropping
other caches), and remount isn't an operation used often, so a little bit
more latency would probably not have been noticed by users.
Nevertheless, it was not strictly necessary to call drop_pagecache_sb in
unionfs_remount, because the objects in question will have gotten
revalidated sooner or later anyway; the call to drop_pagecache_sb was just
an optimization (one which I wasn't 100% sure about anyway, as per my long
"XXX" comment above that call in unionfs_remount).
So I agree with you: if this symbol can be abused by modules and cause
problems, then exporting it to modules is too risky.  I've reworked my code
to avoid calling drop_pagecache_sb and I'll [sic] drop that patch.
Cheers,
Erez.
