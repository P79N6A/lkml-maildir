Just wanted to 'chime' in here.  Yes this would be noisy and will have an
affect
on system performance however these statistics are what are used in
conjunction with
several others to size systems as well as to plan on growth.  If Linux is to
be put into
an enterprise environment these types of statistics will be needed.
When you start hooking up 100's of 'physical volumes' (be it real disks or
raided logical drives)
this data helps you pin-point problems.   I think the idea of having the
ability to turn such accounting
on/off via  /proc entry a very nice method of doing things.
That way you can leave it off for normal run-time but when users complain or
DBA's et al
you can turn it on get some stats for a couple hours/days whatever, then
turn it back off and
plan an upgrade or re-create a logical volume or stripping set.
