No, and most file copies are not to be used in the "near" future. I.e. on
my machine. Caching on the second read (close in time) is ok, or if there
are unused ram, but paging out things in use is bad. It's much more likely
that the page allocated to a program will be used than a newly read or written 
file.
Ofcourse your milega may vary. I'm thinking of my desktop now.
