For fujitsu, problem is called "empty" node.
When ACPI's SRAT table includes "possible nodes", ia64 bootstrap(acpi_numa_init)
creates nodes, which includes no memory, no cpu.
I tried to remove empty-node in past, but that was denied.
It was because we can hot-add cpu to the empty node.
(node-hotplug triggered by cpu is not implemented now. and it will be ugly.)
For HP, (Lee can comment on this later), they have memory-less-node.
As far as I hear, HP's machine can have following configration.
(example)
Node0: CPU0   memory AAA MB
Node1: CPU1   memory AAA MB
Node2: CPU2   memory AAA MB
Node3: CPU3   memory AAA MB
Node4: Memory XXX GB
AAA is very small value (below 16MB)  and will be omitted by ia64 bootstrap.
After boot, only Node 4 has valid memory (but have no cpu.)
Maybe this is memory-interleave by firmware config.
Thanks,
