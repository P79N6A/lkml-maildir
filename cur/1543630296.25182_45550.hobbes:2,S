I'm not an expert, but this perhaps isn't a reiserfs problem.
I'm using reiserfs and i've never had a problem. The only corruption i've seen is 
while compiling kernel. The .o file was being created, and if i shut down the computer,
at restart, when i try to compile the kernel again, gcc  says that doesn't understands the .o file
This was because when replaying the journal the file was created, but it has random data. This is normal,
because reiserfs only assures the metadata integrity, not the data.
