I see but how can I manage the fact that files "assert" and "clear"
are created according to pps->info.mode field content?
See the code:
int pps_sysfs_create_source_entry(struct pps_device *pps)
{
        int ret;
        /* Create file "assert" and "clear" according to source capability */
        if (pps->info.mode & PPS_CAPTUREASSERT) {
                ret = device_create_file(pps->dev, &dev_attr_assert);
                if (ret)
                        dev_err(pps->dev, "unable to create \"assert\" "
                                        "sysfs entry");
        }
        if (pps->info.mode & PPS_CAPTURECLEAR) {
                ret = device_create_file(pps->dev, &dev_attr_clear);
                if (ret)
                        dev_err(pps->dev, "unable to create \"clear\" "
                                        "sysfs entry");
        }
        ret = device_create_file(pps->dev, &dev_attr_mode);
        if (ret)
                dev_err(pps->dev, "unable to create \"mode\" sysfs entry");
Do you think is better create these files anyway and in case report a
NULL string?
Thanks,
Rodolfo
