  In my dreams. :)  But someone must have such hardware or the panic
wouldn't have been removed...
  Only reason I found it at all is I had changed the exact same lines
in my patch (and mine had a much bigger bug than that.)

 The patch does two things:
  1.  Reserves all of priority level E for the timers --
      legacy timer at E7, first system vector DF.
      This is might be worth doing (but first system
      vector should be E0.)
  2.  Starts assigning devices at 0x30 instead of 0x31.
(1) is probably worth doing (first system vector should be E0, though.)

 But doesn't IRQ 0x80, even though it is software-initiated, contend
with 'real' device interrupts at priority 8, which would mean there are
three possible sources (80, 81 and 89?)  That's what I was assuming...
