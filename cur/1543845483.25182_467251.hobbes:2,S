As I like replying to myself, I of course intentionally forgot to answer
this question... *sigh*
I used etherwake this time, but tried with a self-made tool (which works
with my Broadcom NIC) when I discovered the bug report.
etherwake 01:23:45:67:89:ab -- works when I shutdown during POST
etherwake ab:89:67:45:23:01 -- works when WOL was enabled with ethtool

I only tried 2.6.18 twice this time, but when I wrote my own tool to do
it, I had probably 20-30 power on -> ethtool -> poweroff cycles before I
decided to look into Bugzilla. As it looked like being fixed already and
I did use the nForce NIC for testing only, I didn't spend any further
time on it back then.
