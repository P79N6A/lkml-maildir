Why then does the application not see the packets as long as
ip_conntrack_amanda is loaded and starts seeing them again as soon as
"rmmod ip_conntrack_amanda" has completed?
And I'm not even arguing with tcpdump which may get the altered copy of the packet.
I am unaware of two things:
1. detailed packet flow and SKBs
2. internal ip_conntrack API.
I am however seeing that ip_conntrack_amanda
1. jams the application's protocol
2. modifies the packet.
So is there any evidence to support the "only a copy" theory?
