I can't browse the web site 
http://www.skandiabanken.se/
 when I run
Linux 2.2.3. But I have no trouble connecting to that site when I run
Linux 2.0 or Windows on the same computer. And I don't have any problems
connecting to other sites when I run Linux 2.2.3.
Netscape says: 'Connect: Host www.skandiabanken.se contacted. Waiting
for reply...' and then nothing more happens. Lynx says 'HTTP request
sent; waiting for response.'.
Can anybody confirm this problem? Any ideas what the cause is?
