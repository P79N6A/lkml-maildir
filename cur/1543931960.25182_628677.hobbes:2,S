You seem to to be confused between speed micro-otimizations and memory 
savings. This patch has nothing to do about a speed optimization. Here, no 
tradeoff justify a "measurable performance improvement" study.
I copied this patch to you because your recent proposal to remove read_mostly 
from linux kernel.
Only you find read_mostly ugly and unmaintanable. I find it way more usefull 
than "static" attributes.
I find 120 bytes is a measurable gain, thank you.
