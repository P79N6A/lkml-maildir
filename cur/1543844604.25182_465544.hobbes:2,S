Clear NACK from me.  The mails I replied to where only the mails Jan started
nitpicking and I looked a little deeper at what he already quoted, maybe
5% of the codebase.  Given the horrors I found there I'm pretty sure there
will be quite a few more.  And given the amount of junk Andrew plans to push
to Linus for 2.6.19 I'll be pretty busy to look at that, aswell as looking
at things I promised David for month now, so I'm a little busy.

And while we're at it, please don't push core change as part of a subsystem
tree ever.  They should go into clearly marked and separately patches via
-mm.
