This was suggested some months ago, but nothing happened. Firstly, the
www.kernel.org page talks about the mailing list and some archives,
but makes no reference to the list FAQ. That's the first thing that
should be fixed. Talk to HPA to change this.
Secondly, either a copy of the FAQ, or a reference to it under
kernel.org:pub/linux/kernel/ would also be a good idea. Talk to Linus
to change this.
