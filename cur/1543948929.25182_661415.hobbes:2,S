29b6 is the IDER, IDE Redirection, network device.  There there will not
be anything "locally" attached to that network device.  I have not been
adding the IDER Management devices to the ata_piix driver, perhaps I
should?   
When in doubt, about an unknown device, check the latest pci.ids file on
http://pciids.sf.net
.  We try to keep it up to date.
Thanks,
