Well, I guess it is thank you -- I got rid of ugly FIXME that would
involve arch-dependend assembly to be solved properly.
... hmm, can play_dead handle all the memory being overwritten? Also
it should probably save and restore registers including MTRRs.
...so I more moved ugly FIXME to better place. Oh well, at least it
uses common infrastructure now. People at Intel doing suspend-to-RAM
on smp systems will need to solve it properly, anyway, because they
need to go to real mode and back.
