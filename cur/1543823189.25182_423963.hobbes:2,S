As you can see from the list just sent, the improved error handling will 
give libata much greater ability to diagnose "controller is being weird" 
type situations, which is a lot of what the relevant bug reports need.
After reviewing those bug reports, I see a couple oopses -- caused by 
BUG()-style code, and fixed in this update -- and one data corruption 
which persists on Sil 311x on rare motherboards.  The rest are either 
addressed with the improved error handling, or are ATAPI + VIA AFAICS.
