I've been using 2.6 exclusively since 2.6.0-test3.  Booted back into 2.4 a 
couple times for debugging purposes in 2003, but I haven't even had a 2.4 
kernel on my laptop since new year's.  (Well, source tarball...)

The problems were all with servers using the 2.4 driver.  I've got a machine 
in pieces upstairs with an SIS900 controller built into the motherboard, I 
can assemble that and give it a whack at some unspecified point in the 
future.  Also the machine my website and email are on has an SIS900 
on-motherboard controller connecting it to its DSL line, but that's in 
Pennsylvania and a bit difficult to debug at present.
I'll see if the problem persists under 2.6.6.

Thanks for actually taking a toothbrush to the sis900 driver.
