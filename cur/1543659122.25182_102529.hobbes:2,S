Cramfs isn't a pseudo-fs. Minix is a non-Linux fs, as are JFS and XFS I
suppose. JFFS and JFFS2 are _not_ non-Linux filesystems (but neither are
they 'Typical hard disk filesystems')
The help text for NFS shouldn't say:
          A superior but less widely used alternative to NFS is provided by
          the Coda file system; see "Coda file system support" below.
... because Coda is actually _above_ :)
