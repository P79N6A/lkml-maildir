Hi Greg, here are some fixes and improvements to the USB ATM
modem drivers, in thirteen patches:
01: trivial modifications (formatting, changes to variable names,
comments, log level changes, printk rate limiting).
02: have minidrivers tell the core about special requirements
using a flags field.
03: remove the unused .owner field in struct usbatm_driver.
04: use kzalloc rather than kmalloc + memset.
05: make xusbatm useable.
06: sternly tell open connections that the game is up when the
modem is disconnected.
07: return the correct error code when out of memory.
08: use dev_kfree_skb_any rather than dev_kfree_skb.
09: specify buffer sizes in bytes, rather than in ATM cells.
10: add mechanism for turning on isochronous urb support.
11: remove the assumption that incoming urbs contain
complete ATM cells.
12: bump some version numbers.
13: EILSEQ hack needed by the ueagle.
All the best,
Duncan.
