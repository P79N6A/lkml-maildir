Yes, and if anyone missed this subtle point, the priorities are
programmable! There have been patches, particularly back in 2.1.120+, to
diddle priority to make marginal system work, or move the failures to
something with more robust retries.
Nice diagram, I'm taking it to a meeting (credited to you of course) where
I will be talking about interrupt use on parallel ports.
