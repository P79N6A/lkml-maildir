Sven,
Thanks for looking into this, but do not get too eager to send updates 
yet. I'm massively rewriting the rt/rt-locks branch, and the flux rate is 
very high. A patch like this will become obsolete in seconds.
If you do want to help, look at any of the other branches. Some have not 
been updated yet, and they all should be able to compile and boot on their 
own. If they do not, then those need to be fixed.
Thanks,
