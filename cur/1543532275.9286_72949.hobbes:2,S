No, the write back is caused by the implicit munmap() of the mapped 
virtual memory region.  Just closing a file handle doesn't cause any
activity in the file itself, usually (although there can be exceptions:
NFS flushes data out to the network on close, for example).

It's nothing to do with the close.  By the time the file handle has
been finally closed, we have already done the VM writeback operation.
