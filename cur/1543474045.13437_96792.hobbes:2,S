To diagnose this problem, yes I do.  Disks are big, modems are slow.

The packets causing problems are passing the crc16 just fine, as well as
the IP header checksum.  Only the TCPv4 checksum is faulty (plus
misrouting etc.).  They are not bit errors, so they indicate a serious
problem somewhere.  Normal networks do not have _any_ IP or TCP checksum
errors because, as you know, most link layers implement a CRC or similar.

Good point.  I've just looked at my /proc/net/snmp, and it looks like
Demon are sending me some packets with faulty IP headers too.  But they
were never logged.
With VJ header compression reenabled, some packets fail the PPP CRC16
too.  But some still get through and have faulty TCPv4 checksums.  Ho hum.

It is?  I've never found a tcpdump that works with PPP and current
kernels.  Anyway, having seen how many errors I've missed because
they're not logged (the faulty IP headers), I'll be looking at the SNMP
data in future.
