	It used to get help from fanout servers, none are in use anymore.
	Vger's load-average is around 0.0 - 0.1, nevertheless ;)
	Picking one address only present at linux-kernel, and counting
	some days backwards with logs (these include also retries,
	which often to the choses sample destination are 0):
/var/log/maillog.1
    232
/var/log/maillog.2
    259
/var/log/maillog.3
    139
/var/log/maillog.4
    102
/var/log/maillog.5
    148
/var/log/maillog.6
    216
/var/log/maillog.7
    240
	So, 100 to 260 messages per day during the past week of rotated
	logs.
	Total daily traffic counts of successfull sends are:
	(Each recipient address, not only domain, gets its own syslog line)
/var/log/maillog.1
 719616
/var/log/maillog.2
 812118
/var/log/maillog.3
 429046
/var/log/maillog.4
 316667
/var/log/maillog.5
 460353
/var/log/maillog.6
 669020
/var/log/maillog.7
 752678
	And the grand-totals of SMTP delivery attempts:
/var/log/maillog.1
 725514
/var/log/maillog.2
 821661
/var/log/maillog.3
 438685
/var/log/maillog.4
 322529
/var/log/maillog.5
 466632
/var/log/maillog.6
 676869
/var/log/maillog.7
 757461
	So, yesterday  linux-kernel traffic represented 97.6% of all
	traffic at VGER.  On day number 4 - also 97.5% ...
	The share of failed delivery attempts (retries, etc) hovers
	around 1-2 percent of all.
	(I did spot calculations, others may want to do some
	 spread-sheeting.)
