I do not understand what your problem is. Do you refuse to recognise
John as the LANANA chair or something?
My patch is done in accordance with this:

That's wonderful, but we cannot ship that. There is no userland
support to create device nodes in dynamic fashion and to ensure
that they do not conflict. This is why Arjan filed for and received
additional majors. Dynamic solutions need some time to float about
the community, I think.
BTW, DASD does the same thing already. I never saw any memo or document
explaining how to use this capability properly. Perhaps SuSE people
support it. Kurt, can you tell anything about it?

I suspect it is a deadlock prevention thing, too. I cannot say if
it ever worked satisfactory... :)

Thanks, that's interesting. Like I said, they are not likely to
get to the distro soon, but I'd love to look at them.
