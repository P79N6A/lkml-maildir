6 millisecs shutting down X.  The sequence is
kbd_bh->pckbd_leds->send_data->udelay
It's running from a tasklet, so in_interrupt() is returning true.

Ah I see.  Yes, you did.  But the BH-context is tripping it up. 
hmm.. I just applied your patch to test6-pre2 (SMP) and I'm getting an NMI
oops at boot time ("Starting numlock")
kbd_bh->pckbd_leds->send_data
it's stuck in the `for (;;)' loop in send_data (or maybe in
kbd_write_output_w).  Problem goes away with UP.  Is it designed to support
SMP?

Yup.  console can block _interrupts_ for 2 millisecs, which is much worse
than scheduling delays (network Rx overruns).

I think conditional_reschedule() is just fine, but I'm an engineer.  I'm
trying to interpret das patchmeister's statements:
   I'm not even against well-defined and well-thought-out "scheduling
   points". They are hackish, but if there is one or two of them to cover
   some specific behaviour then that's ok. Not a big deal.
I'll shut up on this and let him speak for himself.

Please, what workload are you testing against?

With my patch, the latencies under VM pressure are utter crap.  If, as you
say, the 60-200 msecs are by-design then sure, the VM needs scheduling
points.  But I believe Andrea has an algorithmic fix in mind?

That's fine with a conditional_schedule() in truncate_inode_pages.

zap_page_range() takes 1 microsecond per page.  So a conditional_schedule
every 512 pages.

Ah, I see.  I wasn't able to demonstrate any network-induced latency at all.
