Which strikes me as kind of silly since guess who called the ACPI resume
vector - the BIOS, so why didn't it do whatever stuff then? :) Anyways
it's not really relevant. The BIOS will never know about add-in cards,
and my contention is that even these can be woken up properly w/o bios
repost (after surmounting technical and potential lack-of-documentation
hurdles, which is why I'd think we would start with an old, ubiquitous,
thouroughly documented video card as our first guinea pig. Matrox
Millennium 2, perhaps?)
I'm not at the point where I can devote time to this yet, so please take
all this with a grain of salt.
