	Hello,
	I have a serious problem with a Dell poweredge 6300 (Dual Xeon,
512 Mb of RAM, SCSI UW2). The server freeze completely quite often (2 or 3
days). I have tried kernels 2.2.12, 2.2.13 and 2.2.14pre11. Since my
upgrade to 2.2.14pre11 I got the following message 2 times:
Dec  7 22:00:48 serv kernel: Uhhuh. NMI received. Dazed and confused, but
trying to continue
Dec  7 22:00:48 serv kernel: You probably have a hardware problem with
your RAM chips
	So I asked Dell to replace RAM chips, but the server froze again
... I also replaced the network card (EEPro to 3C905).
	Any ideas ? Thanks.
