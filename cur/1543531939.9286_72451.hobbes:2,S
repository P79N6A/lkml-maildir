I am observing some IDE-related probs with 2.3.99pre3 as well.  Variable
throughput and a complete crash.
It's a BP6 with a couple of Seagates on the UDMA66 channel.  When I use
'hdparm -d1 -A1' I see 22 MBytes/sec from 'hdparm -t'.  But after a
little I/O (a couple more 'hdparm -t' commands is enough) the throughput
falls away to 6 MB/s.
I assume that the drive is doing a soft reset and losing the '-A1'
setting (hdparm -K1 gets an I/O error). This theory may be incorrect
because 'readahead    =  8 (on)' remains true even when it's running
slowly.

I tried '-X66' and the disk system locked up altogether but the OS kept
running.  After finding another /sbin/init (handy app, that) I tried
-X34.
This crashes the OS altogether.  I used 'hdparm -q -A1 -q -d1 -X34
/dev/hdf' followed by 'hdparm -t /dev/hdf' and the console reported:
hdf: timeout waiting for DMA
ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_timeout func only: 14
And the system froze.
Andre, this freeze is 100% reproducible, so I can run any tests/patches
as required.
