Errmm. The 0x66 prefix is used to change the implied register size
when using a register. It has nothing to do with a branch. It
can be used to cause the CPU to load the full-width of the
instruction pointer and the segment descriptor when transitioning
from 16-bit to 32-bit execution mode. This is an unconditional
jump immediate, instruction, not a branch. If it's used with a branch
instruction, near or far, the CPU should execute an "illegal operand
fault" (actually invalid opcode fault is the correct grammar since
neither AMD nor Intel make law).
Whether or not the CPU traps this invalid instruction is moot. No
compiler would emit junk like this and anybody horsing around with
an assembler deserves whatever they get, although you shouldn't
be able to smoke the CPU on a multi-user multitasking system because
it can be used as a DOS attack.
