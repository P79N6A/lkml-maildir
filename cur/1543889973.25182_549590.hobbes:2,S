btw - does in-kernel lzo scale on SMP systems ?
is it a matter of lzo builtin compression or a matter of the component using 
in-kernel lzo compression ?
if i write/read data on reiser4 filesystem with lzo compression on - will 
all CPUs being used ?
just curious here, because i remember reading about a scale problem with zfs 
filesystem and gzip compression on solaris, so i'm just curious what to 
expect on linux.

roland
ps:
btw - there is a smp aware lzop utility at lemley.net/lzop_patches/lzop.html
