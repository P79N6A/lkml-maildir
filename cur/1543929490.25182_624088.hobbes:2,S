Sure. I'll resend them.

Not too much. Jeremy is handling the page table code, and I'm basically
taking care of the rest. I don't go to far in integration in other
areas, so the patches are the same that were already previously sent
some days ago. I'll just rebase and send again.
The only rebase I'm expecting to be troublesome is the paravirt.c /
paravirt.h files. So I'd say we're close.
