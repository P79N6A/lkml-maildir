I can freely upgrade/downgrade kernels on some distros[1] if I wish to,
as they support such things.  Just complain to your distro maker if you
have this issue :)
I'm worrying about documenting this stuff, and allowing a way for kernel
people to work with the userspace people that use these interfaces to
hopefully not break things in ways that are unexpected, and/or break
things at all.

It all depends on the type of interface, sysfs is still shaking itself
out as more and more people use it.  udev today can work with the
changes we have in store for sysfs in the future (see Kay's old patches
on lkml for the kernel for examples of where we are going), so udev
looks to work just fine.  But we want to know what other programs uses
these interfaces so they too can be prepared in case things happen.
And remember, HAL is there to handle all of the crap and flux in the
kernel api and hide it from all other userspace programs.  It is _much_
easier to work with one program to ensure that we don't break things and
test stuff out to see how they will work better, than have to run around
all of Gnome and KDE to touch up all of the different programs.  But
that's a topic that has nothing to do with this thread, sorry.

That's what the "Users:" lines are for, so that we can all work together
as one big happy team :)

Agreed.

No, not many programs use ioctls.  And a lot of them are stable and have
not changed in years (tty, block, etc.) and should be explicitly
documented here.
These examples were just examples of things that go into the different
directories.  There is a lot more work ahead to document everything that
is currently implemented.

The "contents" are merely symlinks back to the device (well, some are
symlinks, others are directories, in the end all will be symlinks.)
And yes, the individual classes need to also be documented to be
through, again, this was a first cut to provide examples, not to be
complete.  Patches are welcome to help flush it all out.
thanks,

[1] Gentoo for example works almost just fine[2] with udev with kernels
ranging from 2.6.9 to 2.6.16-rc4, I haven't tried older kernels than
that in a long time.
[2] cdrom symlinks don't get created on older kernels due to IDE
changes, but a simple rule change handles that, and could be added to
the main install if it becomes annoying.
