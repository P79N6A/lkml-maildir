I have a couple of questions about the interactive scheduling.
First, since we're dealing with real-time and audio issues, is there any 
way we can do this:  When the interrupt arrives from the sound card so 
that the driver needs to set up DMA for the next block or whatever it 
does, move any processes which talk to an audio device to the head of 
the process queue?  Can this idea be applied to other things, such as 
moving X to the head of the queue when the DRI driver gets a "there is 
free space in the command queue" interrupt from the graphics engine?
Second, we're dealing with lots of different CPUs here, and so results 
are going to vary.  Is this being taken into account?  For any given 
interactive load, different systems will be able to carry that load only 
to the point where one has a CPU slow enough that it can't complete all 
interactive processing in the desired time.  I don't think we should be 
making scheduler tweaks to fix this corner case because it's impossible 
to fix, no?
