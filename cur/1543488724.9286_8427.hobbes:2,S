Ok, sounds like I do have an improper configuration of my local
DNS then.  Here is what I get from nslookup:
1 root@red:/# nslookup red.prv
Server:  localhost
Address:  127.0.0.1
*** localhost can't find red.prv: Non-existent host/domain
1 root@red:/# nslookup gw.red.prv
Server:  localhost
Address:  127.0.0.1
Name:    gw.red.prv
Address:  192.168.1.2
So it looks like somehow I missed red.prv.   It *IS* in
/etc/hosts though, and is correct.  Something must be ignoring
"files" and doing "dns" instead.  I know that everything else is
configured properly.  The only possible misconfig would be in
named.conf or named.red.prv or named.192.168.1
I just checked my named.red.prv file and found no entry for
red.prv.  ;o)  I just added it and nslookup now resolves.  ;o)
Hopefully the error will disappear from my log now.  ;o)
