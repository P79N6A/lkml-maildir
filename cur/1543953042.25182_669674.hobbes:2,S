#define __SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED(lockname)
seems pretty suggestive to me, also DEFINE_SPINLOCK(x) shows the proper
usage; the right thing would have been:
static struct diu_hw dr = {
 	.mode = MFB_MODE1,
-	.reg_lock = __SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED(old_style_spin_init),
+	.reg_lock = __SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED(dr.reg_lock),
};
Where 'dr.reg_lock' is the expression to locate the actual object.
Does something like this make sense to you:

Subject: lockdep: document __SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED() usage
Small comment clarifying the intended usage of __SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED()
[ for the observant readers; yes this prescribes a usage that is more
  than strictly needed, it does however enable interesting future uses ]

Perhaps I should make the macros do something like:
  typecheck(spinlock_t, lockname)
And sweep the tree to make it compile again.

FWIW, I prefer the form: GFP_type | __GFP_modifiers
For instance: 'GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_DMA | __GFP_ZERO'
