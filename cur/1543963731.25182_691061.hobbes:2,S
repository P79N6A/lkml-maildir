OK, so these symbols are required on visws as well.  So that makes the
gating config symbol X86_LOCAL_APIC.
Could you run this through the same config to verify; thanks!

Subject: [VOYAGER] fix duplicate phys_cpu_present_map symbol
The phys_cpu_present_map is an expected symbol in the SMP harness.
Unfortunately, x86 recently moved this and a few others to
kernel/setup.c where it doesn't quite work because voyager has to
define its own.  Use CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC to isolate these
definitions and fix up another area in setup.c where CONFIG_X86_SMP
should be used instead of CONFIG_SMP.
