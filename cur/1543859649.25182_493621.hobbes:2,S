I think one can have multiple labels named as 10: so we need to specify
which one do you want to jump to. Either forward one (f) or backward
one (b).

Ok. so indirect jump seems to be having problem. On my machine disassembly
of setup.o show following.
ff a6 14 02 00 00       jmp    *0x214(%esi)
This seems to be fine as 0x14 is the offset of code32_start, and 
((DELTA_INITSEG) << 4) is 0x200. How does it look like on your machine?
Thanks
