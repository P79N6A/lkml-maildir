So you're advocating feeding random stuff from the internet directly to end 
users without any sturgeon's law filter at all, and this is an improvement 
over automated probing of mostly standards-compliant busses for known 
hardware?

I was specifically thinking Microsoft, actually.  And every script kiddie in 
existence who thinks screwing up the linux automated install gives them 31337 
status.  (A new reason to crack webservers: add links to poison the google 
cache.  Sigh...)

I'm all for having a "known strange" list.  Eric volunteered to maintain one 
in regards to DMI, which is sort of per-motherboard anyway.
But I tend to lean in favor of a having a maintainer for a database people 
contribute exceptions to.  Which basically means we might as well just make 
the autoprober smarter via an exception list...

At the moment, "make autoprobe" is a really nice tool for setting 99% of the 
questions in "make menuconfig" to the correct answers.
However, it's also a great tool for squeezing obscure bugs out of the 
database like the fact if you DO switch on a PCMCIA network card that doesn't 
automatically switch on CONFIG_NET.  (Missing dependency, not yet in 2.1.3.  
One of the four questions it gets wrong about my laptop.  Out of a hundred 
and something, that's not bad...)
As a result "make autoconfigure" generally needs a couple of switches 
manually flipped before you get the config you want.  (But we're working on 
it.  More boxes to probe is always a good thing...  Send the results to Eric. 
 Or me, since Eric will be on the road this weekend.  Or that Gicacamo 
Catanazi dude, whose name I am highly unlikely to have spelled correctly 
because the deck is stacked against me here.)

Sure.  If you want your distribution vendor to build your kernel for you, 
that's great.  We're just trying to give you another option.

Right now, you're right.  It ALMOST works, but the bugs are still being 
squeezed out.  And about half the bugs are in the configuration rulebase 
rather than in the autoprober.  (It's amazing how many bad combinations CML1 
would allow you to do.  Did you know if you accidentally turn off the 
networking menu in the old menuconfig, there's no way to get it back without 
editing the config file by hand?  Sigh...)

Please let me know how it breaks.  (No, I'm not going to say "if", I'm not 
that optimistic yet.  2.2.0 perhaps...)
