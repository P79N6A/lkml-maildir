I'm not remembering much about the RH install, but have you tried using 
a console durring the early part of the installand repointing the mount 
points to where you want them?  This is a question that is best for 
RedHat's own lists.  I know this can be done as I've done it in the 
past.  It's been awhile since I've admined RedHat systems for 
developers.  I'm only admining Debian systems now.
