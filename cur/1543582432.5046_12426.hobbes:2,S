Whenever the question has been asked the answer is always assume anything
in the kernel outside of the current function blocks.

Nope.  It looks like someone made a mistake in ext2...

Not normally.  The rule is that syscall don't change period.  The
internal kernel interface is different.  It is allowed to change.
As for syscall changing auditing most apps did happen when the LFS
spec was put together.  So you would have an implementation that would
keep most apps from failing on large files.

Hmm.  The developers should get together and pow wow when the problem
is noticed.  When it is finally talked out about how it should happen
then the code should get fixed accordingly.
It isn't about right and wrong it is about working code.  Not that
documenting things doesn't help.  And 2.4 is going in that direction...
