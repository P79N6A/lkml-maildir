Persuasively argued.  You appear to have your wish, as this
patch was merged in -pre5.
A `dirsync' option does make sense though, for the reasons which
Stephen outlined.
The whole handling of synchronous operations needs a rip-up-and-rewrite
anyway.  We're currently holding onto a stack of locks while waiting
for the disk to spin round and round.  It's a great scalability bottleneck
for multiple threads doing things in the same directory.   This is
something I shall look at when the kernel versions turn odd.
