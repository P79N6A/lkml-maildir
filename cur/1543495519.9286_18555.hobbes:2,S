   You mean putting this kind of detection into setserial instead of
   kernel? Well, that might work... We'll still need to create new
   serial-chip type "hispeed" (because bank selection has to be done in
   other way or chip failsback into compatibility mode). I just thought
   that doing detection automatically on boot is nicer...
Yeah, we would need to allocate a new UART for this type.... and by the
way, it's not clear to me that "hispeed" is appropriate, since this hack
is probably SMC motherboard specific, right?  
As far as doing autodetection on boot, I've been moving for a long time
towards having an /etc/rc.d/init.d/serial script which gets run at boot
time; the latest setserial program comes with such a script.  
So I agree it should happen automatically at boot --- I just think that
a user-mode program fired out of /etc/rc.d scripts is a better place to
put this kind of thing.   Of course, if there is some timing constraint
which means it has to be done as a kernel module, my next preference
would be a module which loaded, did its dirty deed, and then unloaded,
again to avoid locking down unpageable kernel memory unnecessarily, and
also making it easier to update the user-mode program to handle
additional motherboards without forcing people to use development
kernels.  (This is why I think PCMCIA support is best distributed
outside the kernel, even though it can be a pain.)
