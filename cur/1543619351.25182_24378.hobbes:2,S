What about the design context?
I'm a bit concerned about the design-level inter-dependencies of
changesets that don't result in source-level dependencies.
Hypothetical situation:
Changeset adds driver for device Q.  Now, let's further suppose that in
2.5.x we have perfect modularity for drivers and at that time Q is
added... we just add a directory, linux/drivers/Qdrv.  It won't conflict
with 2.5, 2.4.x, 2.2.x, etc..  However, because 2.2.x does not have the
hooks necesary to see it, Q won't work on those kernels.  There is a
design-level dependency in changeset q.
This would be indirectly addressed with the 'backmerg marker tag', but I
have a nagging doubt.
Maybe a better example:
What about changing a global variable (say, from 'events' to
'global_events')?  You change it in the global place, yielding a
changeset.  Later, the individual users change the name.  But if an
individual user has seen very little change in the time before the
global_events change (and the global location has been changing a lot),
that patchset could backmerge beyond the global change.
Say 'f' was the global change, and 'g' was an individual change. 
Backmerge could yield:
        a -> b -> c -> f
                -> d
                -> e
          -> g
even though 'g' really depends on 'f'.
Thoughts?
