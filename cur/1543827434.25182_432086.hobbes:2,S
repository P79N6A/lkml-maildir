My initial hope was that simply tweaking the container_of macro would
be enough to get the inside-block pointers (or, at least, modify some
key places like net/core/dev.c) but it looks like it wasn't and I
introduced the memleak_not_leak() function which had to be added to
some individual drivers as well.
As I said, I'll do some tests first because looking at all the
locations inside a block might make the tool less useful.
