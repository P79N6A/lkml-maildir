I changed something here a few weeks ago. The idea was to avoid
listing partitions of size 0 but do list full devices, regardless
of size. Especially in case of removable media that is useful.
For example, a
	blockdev --rereadpt /dev/sda
might show that there is something there now.
Will look at what might cause your strange numbers. Unfortunately
recent 2.5 kernels do not boot for me.
