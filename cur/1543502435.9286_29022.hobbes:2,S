I've got some serious corruption on a 2.2.10 kernel.  Here's the results
of a cksum on two FTP downloads of the 2.2.5 kernel:
[root@mars6 src]# cksum linux-2.2.5.tar.gz
836045113 13497506 linux-2.2.5.tar.gz
[root@mars6 src]# cksum linux-2.2.5.tar.gz.2
706128008 13497506 linux-2.2.5.tar.gz.2
[root@avarice src]# cksum linux-2.2.5.tar.gz 
1354232067 13497506 linux-2.2.5.tar.gz
The last one is what I was expecting to get, since I downloaded it on a
server that doesn't seem to have any similar problems.  It also runs
2.2.10, but it doesn't crash.
I've been having crashes on former box, so I decided to downgrade to 2.2.5
with the DoS patch.  The thing that tipped me off to the problems was my
"make dep" crashed with the Makefile in fs/minix being strangely
corrupted.  Just some characters out of order, AFAICT.  But then I
re-untarred the tarball, and it gave me an error saying the tarball was in
an invalid format.  And somewhere in there the tarball had actually
changed on me.  So I downloaded a new copy of the tarball, which had a
different chacksum.  So I downloaded a new one, which also had a different
checksum, even though I pulled it down from the same mirror site.
If anyone wants a copy of the tarballs, I can try and retrieve them -- no
guarantee that they'll be in their current state though.  Seeing as one of
them mutated in between two untars, they seem pretty unstable.
