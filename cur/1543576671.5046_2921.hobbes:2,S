Subject: 2.4.0-test12: PCMCIA IRQ assignments?

Hello,
I have a Sager NP9820 laptop with an ALI chipset and a TI PCI1251BGFN
PCMCIA chipset.  For some reason, when I use the yenta module under 2.4.0,
it gets an incorrect IRQ assignment.  It uses IRQ11, which is also used by
my ATI Rage Pro card... therefore, when you install this module, the
machine locks up.
If I use the pcmcia card services under 2.2.16, then the PCMCIA bridge
gets a correct assignment of IRQ 10.  I've poked around a bit and haven't
found a way to force the 2.4.0 module to use a specific IRQ... is there a
way to do this without hardcoding it?
Otherwise, this is an ideal laptop to run Linux.
Thanks,
--J
