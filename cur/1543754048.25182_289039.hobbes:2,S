I have no knowledge of the internals of the radeon family, but I am
under the impression that they require some hacks to work around bugs in
the silicon. There is a rather big patch coming, see
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.11-
rc1/2.6.11-rc1-mm2/broken-out/radeonfb-massive-update-of-pm-code.patch
This patch also rewrites the questionable section in
radeon_pm_setup_for_suspend. I just found it and have not yet built a
new kernel, so I cannot comment on its effectiveness. 
For reference, the power management issues of the T41 have their own
bugzilla entry:
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3022
On a side note, since kernel 2.6.10 I have not been able to successfully
resume from acpi S3 + radeonfb any more (T41 2379-DJU, radeon mobility
M9) - works under 2.6.9 and 2.6.11-rc1 + vgaconsole. I'm still trying to
isolate the problem/waiting for some of the pm code to settle.
Best,
Volker
