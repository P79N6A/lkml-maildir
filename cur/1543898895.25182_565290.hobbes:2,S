This statement is ganarally false.
There is the limitation in the freezer that it cannot handle uninterruptible
tasks and that's all.
Now, this is not usual for user space tasks to make other user space
tasks become uninterruptible.  I'd say this is a little strange.

Which doesn't change the fact that FUSE _is_ special, because it adds
dependencies between processed that were not present before.
