It is way too easy to truncate some library and all executables (that are loaded
right now) will go nuts (Just did echo >/lib/libncurses.so.5.2 and expected
everything will get SIGBUS, but all the bashes and mutt went crazy consuming
memory until oom-killer killed them. Kind of surprising behaviour, I'd say.
Test was done on 2.4.19).
Also *BSD systems seems to return -ETXTBSY not only when you try to write-open 
running executables, but also all of shared libs used (and this is probably
even more logical ).
Bye,
