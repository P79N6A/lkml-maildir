Hi!
Some VIA south bridges , including the 82C686B model that I have,
support higher speeds on the serial ports, like 230400, 460800 and
maybe 921600 bps.
Has anyone any docs on how to program the chip for this speeds ?
I only have the VIA 686 register layout. There is a certain "High speed"
bit mentioned. If I set it , and use the system normally to get 115200 bps,
then I get 230400 bps like speeds ( measured FTP transfer rate over null
modem PPP connection between two PCs ).
Anyone know how to get higher speeds ?
