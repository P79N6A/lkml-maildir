Hmm, I like it.  But I prefer to pull the depmod code into the source
too, to keep it all under one roof.
The ELF dependence will go back in eventually, but that's trivial.
Hmm, Adam, do you want to reverse positions and become
module-init-tools maintainer?  I'll send patches to you, instead of
vice versa.  I'll release a 0.8 with the patches I have so far, then
hand it over if you want.
Thoughts?
Rusty.
