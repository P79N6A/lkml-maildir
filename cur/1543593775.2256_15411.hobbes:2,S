Yep.
Consider a chunk of x86 instructions using a home-grown OS
abstraction layer, and drivers that implement that layer for
both Linux and any non-GPL operating system. The binary blob
is obviously not derived from Linux, and may in fact run
without modification in a BSD or Solaris/x86 kernel.
There is in fact just such a layer. It might not currently
have the features needed to implement TCP, but it could be
extended as needed.
