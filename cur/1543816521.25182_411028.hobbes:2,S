OK, this should probably work, but adding a new device support might require
a bit more effort...
And since I started looking into the code, I think it may see some
cleanup, so I'll be submitting shortly a series of two patches, yours included
as a second one. I'll CC you and please add the correct Signed-off-by line if
you agree and repost.
The page for this device is here:

What about:
s/PAPOUCHE_VENDOR/PAPOUCHE_VID/g
s/PAPOUCHE_THEM_PROD/PAPOUCHE_TMU_PID/g

You are not using UTF-8 capable MUA or editor or both, so the umlaut is
broken here.

Credits are better with the PID/VID lines, not here. Just look at what
other (most) people have done.
add at least the name [TMU] here

IMHO, `diff -ruN` or `diff -pruN` should be better when posting patches :-)
