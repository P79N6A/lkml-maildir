how reproducable are these lockups - could you possibly trace it? If yes 
then please apply:
  
http://www.tglx.de/private/tglx/ht-debug/tracer.diff
and run the attached trace-it-1sec.c thing in a loop:
  echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/mcount_enabled
  while true; do
     ./trace-it-1sec > trace-`date`.txt
  done
and wait for the lockup. Once it happens, please upload the trace*.txt 
file that contains the lockup, i guess we'll be able to tell you more 
about the nature of the lockup. (Perhaps increase the sleep(1) to 
sleep(5) to capture longer periods and to increase the odds that you 
catch the lockup while the utility is tracing.)

 *
 * user-triggered tracing.
 *
 * The -rt kernel has a built-in kernel tracer, which will trace
 * all kernel function calls (and a couple of special events as well),
 * by using a build-time gcc feature that instruments all kernel
 * functions.
 * 
 * The tracer is highly automated for a number of latency tracing purposes,
 * but it can also be switched into 'user-triggered' mode, which is a
 * half-automatic tracing mode where userspace apps start and stop the
 * tracer. This file shows a dumb example how to turn user-triggered
 * tracing on, and how to start/stop tracing. Note that if you do
 * multiple start/stop sequences, the kernel will do a maximum search
 * over their latencies, and will keep the trace of the largest latency
 * in /proc/latency_trace. The maximums are also reported to the kernel
 * log. (but can also be read from /proc/sys/kernel/preempt_max_latency)
 *
 * For the tracer to be activated, turn on CONFIG_WAKEUP_TIMING and
 * CONFIG_LATENCY_TRACE in the .config, rebuild the kernel and boot
 * into it. Note that the tracer can have significant runtime overhead,
 * so you dont want to use it for performance testing :)
