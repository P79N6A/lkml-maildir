So then please do *all* the work, not only the first half. Writing a
driver is a nice thing, but doesn't actually help anybody. Doing a
driver for eg. Linux means to *care* for it. That is, writing it is only
the very first step of a longer way. The next step is to supply patches
for review. Then you'll get some feedback and you're expected to work
the issues out. Then you can again submit patches -- and repeat this
until it's merged.

Then please work on getting your driver included into Linus' and Andrews
kernel sources. For some time, both drivers may co-exist, but once one
driver is *really* superior over the other one and there are *no* issues
left that force people to use the worse driver, that one will die out at
some time.
But please be prepared to be in a competitive position. You've won't get
your driver included by just telling once about it; you'll need to work
towards that goal, and probably monitor the driver to be useable in the
future.
