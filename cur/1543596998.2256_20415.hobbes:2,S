It is not a problem when a system is isolated from all other systems, but if
we do this while some program is in a tcp/ip session, like a webserver, the
program will not beable to respond to an outside computer for the time while
we are swaping and initilizing kernels.  The tcp connection will time out on
the side of the other computer then. But this is still quite managable
compared to a minute or 2 for a system to totaly reboot itself.

Yes, so it will not be a problem at least with processes dieing because they
did not get message X at time Y.
