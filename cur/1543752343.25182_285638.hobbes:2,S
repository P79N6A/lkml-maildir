Subject: Removing a module even if use count is not zero

hello linux-experts,
    I inserted my module into the running kernel that
intercepts read system call. I am using kernel 2.4.28.
Now, I am unable to remove it since each and every
time, the module is used by some process. How can I
remove the module even if the usecount is not zero?
    Can anyone help me regarding this?
Thanks,
selva
