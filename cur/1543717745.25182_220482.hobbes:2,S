Excuse me for interrupting.
Surely the main concern is the place where this runs not the kernel 
developer or application developer.
I know it's not a good situation, it never has been, but sites often 
aren't able to upgrade to new versions of kernels or products, in anything 
like short order, for all sorts of reasons.
