It's not a performance problem, it's a lockup problem.  I use bacula
to make my backups using the DLT7000 as my media.  But the tape drives
hangs, it's hung now so that I can't do my backups.

The drive should be able to do 10MBytes/sec to the interface, the
drive itself can only do 5Mbytes/sec to the media, but with 2:1
compression and an 8MB buffer on the drive, it likes to be fed data as
quickly as it can.  
Here's the validation results for my two disks and tape drive:
