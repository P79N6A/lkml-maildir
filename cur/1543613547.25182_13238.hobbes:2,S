One thing I thought of is the process on lets say node2 have exactly the same
address space as on node 1 when it is migrated.  You could be trying to return from a syscall
to an address space of a process that doesn't exist on the node or hasn't migrated yet.
Just a thought

Hi, 
 	I am trying to do  process migration between nodes  using alpha
architecture. For explaining what is happening I will take the process
getting migrated from node1 to node2. I am using struct pt_regs  for
rebuilding the process on  node2.I am getting the same  value of struct
pt_regs on node1 and on node2 ( I print is using dik_show_regs) Now I
want to set the value of registers including the program counter with
the value i got from node1. Right now I am doing
ret_from_sys_call(&regs). But then i am getting a Oops . The Oops
message contain all the register values same as that I got from node1
except pc and ra 
	Any idea where I went wrong ?
