Sorry, this will show my ignorance...  my system is lacking
/proc/sysrq-trigger.  I can find how to build a kernel with the magic sysrq
key (CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ=y), and have done so, but I still don't have
/proc/sysrq-* and cannot seem to find how to build in sysrq functionality
itself - assuming that's what's missing.  Presumably it's something in
.config I'm just not seeing?
Thanks again!
Matt

Please generate an all-task backtrace during the stall via:
dmesg -n 8
<wait for a stall>
echo t > /prov/sysrq-trigger
dmesg -s 1000000 > foo
and send foo.
