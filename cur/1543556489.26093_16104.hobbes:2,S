Do you have it?
The sympthomes are that the card triggers Flow Control Pause condition (and
interrupt) on the last stages of the initialization or right after.
And it happens with flow control being explicitly turned off.
High network load considerably increase the chances of the event.
After that the card stops to behave sane and reports status 0x7048.
It may happen that we don't understand something in the initialization
sequence, or just a plain hardware bug.

Yes, you're right.
