It is definately interesting, HOWEVER the OOM rescue code is
only to be run in an emergency.
This means Linus probably doesn't want us running around making
the common case slower by gathering loads of statistics. Then
again, this may be a statistic the SAR people may be interested
in.
Also, it should be relatively simple to DoS a box running this
selection algorithm. Real programs will touch their memory all
the time and fault a lot, a malicious hog only has to allocate
memory and touch it once...
