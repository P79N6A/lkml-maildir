A problem with similar symptoms was corrected in driver version 6.2.37
back in August of last year.  Can you try using the latest driver source
from here:
	
http://people.FreeBSD.org/~gibbs/linux/SRC/
and see if your problem persists?  The aic79xx driver archive at the
above location includes both the aic7xxx and aic79xx drivers.  If this
does not resolve your problem there are other debugging options we can
enable that may aid in tracking down the problem.
