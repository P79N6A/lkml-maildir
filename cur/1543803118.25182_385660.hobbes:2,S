I'm adding missing cc:, I hope I didn't forget about anybody this time.
There is now bugzilla entry for this bug (thanks Ondrej):
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5882
Jens, could you take a look at the part related to ide-cd timeouts?

The patch was NACK-ed by Alan Cox and I agree with him (this should be
done differently).  This __ide_dma_off() chunk looks sensible but does it fix
the issue?  I was under impression that after a reset drive looses its DMA
xfer mode and needs to be reprogrammed (ATA spec has the answer).

I'll let Jens comment on this one. :)
