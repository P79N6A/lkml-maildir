Weird.  The output seems to suggest that your .config is wrong.  You want
the following in there:
CONFIG_PARTITION_ADVANCED=y
CONFIG_MSDOS_PARTITION=y
CONFIG_LDM_PARTITION=y
I suggest you run make menuconfig and make sure that you have actually
selected support for both MSDOS and LDM partitions...  Or edit your
.config and make sure you have the above three lines and then run make
oldconfig...
Let me know if that still gives you problems.  It shouldn't!
Best regards,
