Too darn few, frankly.

256 zones is fairly exorbitant.  I suspect the number of machines which have
a) more than 16 zones and 
b) CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND
is zero. So you can always munch into the top eight bits.
PG_checked is supposed to be removed - I have not looked into that.  PG_slab
is fairly optional.
PG_highmem can go away.  (just use page_zone(page)->is_highmem)
I would dearly like to dump PG_reserved, but I doubt if I'll get onto that.
(thinks about what happens if you start a direct-io read from a soundcard DMA
buffer, and munmap/close while that is in progress...)
So.  There's not a lot of fat there, but we're not all out of options.
