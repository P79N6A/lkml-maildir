I have all devices available. Right now I have udev running but I also 
tried a fully populated static /dev directory.
My current tty looks quite normal like
crw-rw-rw- 1 0 0 5, 0 Sep 1 12:10 /dev/tty
and tty1, tty2 have
crw-rw-rw- 1 0 0 4, 1 Sep 1 12:10 /dev/tty1
crw-rw-rw- 1 0 0 4, 2 Sep 1 12:10 /dev/tty2
