Subject: oops with pci=biosirq in 2.4.22 (not in 2.4.18)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Unfortunately I can't get a copy of the oops because 
the screen immediately fills with hex addresses 
(looks like a looping call trace)
2.6.0test9 does not suffer from this problem.
I don't have time to try more kernels and narrow the window at the
moment.
perhaps this is enough information for somebody who knows where to look.
