ATTN:
Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one 
apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that everything will 
be well at the end of the day.I have decided to contact you due to 
the urgency of this transaction. 
Let me start by introducing myself properly to you.I am Mr. Benny Mapongo,
an external auditor with NedBank, Johannesburg, South Africa . 
THE PROPOSITION: 
A french man, Late Engr.Jean claude Pierre (Snr) a merchant ,  
formerly working in Witwatersrand Johannesbourg Gold Mine,
Johannesburg South Africa until his death months ago in Kenya 
Air Bus (A310 - 304)Flight KQ431, he banked with us at NedBank 
Johannesbourg and had a closing balance as at the end of 
September, 2000 worth $33,800.000.00 (Thirty Three Million eight 
hundred United State Dollars), (this is aside the accrued interest 
so far from that date) the bank now expects his next of kin as 
beneficiary to come up for claims. Valuable efforts are being made
by the Bank to get in touch with any of the Claude's Family or Relatives but to no success. 
It is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to 
locate any of Late Engr. Jean Claude Pierre(Snr.)'s next of kin because,(he 
had no wife nor children that is known to us). The Management under 
the influence of her Chairman and Members of the Board of Directors, 
made arrangement  for the fund to be decleared "Unclaimed" and 
subsequentlly be donated to the Trust Fund for arms and ammunition 
to further enhance the course of War in Africa and the World in General. 
In order to avert this negative development, some of my trusted 
colleagues and I now seek your permission to have you stand as next 
of kin to the late Engr. Jean Claude Pierre (Snr.) so that the fund 
will be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary / next 
of kin. 
All documents and proves to enable you get this fund will be 
carefully worked out. The probate registry of the Federal Ministry 
of Justice have issues an order of Mandamus to locate any of 
the deceased's beneficiary(ies), and more so I am assuring you 
that this business is 100% Risk Free. 
Your share will be 30% of the total sum while 70% will be for myself and 
my colleagues for investment purposes, according to agreement between 
both parties. However,It might interest you to know that you can claim 
the fund in Nedbank's main branch here in Johannesburg South Africa 
or in her affiliate clearing  house.
We shall arrange to make the name of beneficiary in your favour 
with Nedbank and also the Probate Registry of the Government of 
South Africa. 
Kindly indicate your interest to enable us make arrangements to get 
the neccessary supporting / back up documents that will make you 
eligible to claim the fund as his next of Kin and beneficairy. 
Please note that for the purposes of confidentiality, all further 
correspondeces would be through my alternative email address:
mapongo@email.com.
Accept my warm regards as I await your response. 
Sincerely, 
Mr. Benny Mapongo..
