One stripe table can only contain one stripe size, so to have two would 
require two tables, and a third table to tie them back together.

The entire idea of a stripe is that you are using multiple identical 
drives ( or partitions ), so it doesn't make any sense to be able to 
truncate one of the drives.  In any case, this is not something you can 
do now, so the fact that you could not do it then either does not seem 
to be a good argument against allowing partial tails.
