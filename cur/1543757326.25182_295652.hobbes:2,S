Agreed.  In practice we actually do this already with /proc/iomem.  
Except that we truncate everything above 4GB, and we allow the
map to get mangled with mem=xxx options.
I brought up the idea of a /proc/cpumem by analogy because on platforms
that have an iommu and memory is in a distinct address space 
there have been complaints that /proc/iomem just won't work.  But it
is simple enough to do something that is just for the cpu's memory.
As for how to do this cleanly this looks like the start of that discussion.
