You think it's easier for a manufacturer of industrial IO cards to
debug a (large) kernel module?

uio is supposed to be a very thin layer. Hotplug and PCI are already
handled by other subsystems.

The majority of industrial IO cards have registers and/or dual port RAM
that can be mapped to user space (even today). We want to add a simple
way to handle interrupts for such cards. That's all.
The fact that there might be some sort of hardware/interrupts/situations
where this is not possible or not so simple isn't that important at the
moment. We can extend the UIO system if somebody actually requires these
extensions.
