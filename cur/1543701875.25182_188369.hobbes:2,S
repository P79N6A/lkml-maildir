Hi,
 just realized the massive changes between 21 and 22. At least that is
answered :-) Question remains why no MC packets arrive in 2.4.22 and
later (checked with tcpdump). Is there anything that one has to enable
when running a newer kernel?
 One diffeernce is the output of "cat /proc/net/igmp". On my 2.4.20
kernel it looks like:
[qx29340@lpsdm16 ~]$ cat /proc/net/igmp
Idx     Device    : Count Querier       Group    Users Timer  Reporter
1       lo        :     0      V2
                                010000E0     1 0:F63C1223            0
2       eth0      :     1      V2
                                010000E0     1 0:F63C1225            0
3       eth1      :     2      V2
                                470B02EF     1 0:F63C2428            1
                                010000E0     1 0:F63C1225            0
 While on 2.4.22/23 it looks like:
qx29340@lpsdm20 linux-2.4.23-1-msc]$ cat /proc/net/igmp
Idx     Device    : Count Querier       Group    Users Timer Reporter
1       lo        :     0      V2
                                010000E0     1 0:FFFE5D5D           0
2       eth0      :     1      V2
                                010000E0     1 0:FFFE5D5D           0
3       eth1      :     2      V2
                                470B02EF     1 0:FFFF8D5D           0
                                010000E0     1 0:FFFE5D5D           0
 The difference seems to be the "reporter" flag for the 470B02EF
multicast group, which is exactely the adrress Ganglia uses.
Any ideas
Cheers
Martin
