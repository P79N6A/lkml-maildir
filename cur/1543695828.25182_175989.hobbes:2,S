Wrong - there are systems out there which do not support ACPI (or maybe
the kernel doesn't support the ACPI which is implemented in them.)

Indeed.  With 2.6 there are zero ways I can make my x86 laptop
suspend or hibernate.

Oh, my problem goes back many kernel versions.  It's nothing new.
Somewhere during 2.5 development (current thinking is somewhere
around 2.5.3x) something changed which makes the APM BIOS believe
that the machine isn't in the correct state to suspend.
However, exactly what that is seems to be impossible to track down.
Building a kernel minimal driver support results in a system which
can't suspend... and by "minimal" that includes dropping stuff like
the input layer and console completely from the kernel.
It basically comes down to some really subtle change in what 2.6 is
does differently from 2.4.
