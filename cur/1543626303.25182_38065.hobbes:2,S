Yes. For the VIA side, I have this in my rc.S stuff:
#!/bin/sh
PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
export PATH
echo -n "Optimizing hardware configuration: "
if command -v setpci >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo -n "PCI"
    #
    # Optimize PCI latency for IDE controllers
    #
    setpci -d 1106:0571 latency_timer=60  >/dev/null 2>&1
    setpci -d 105a:*	latency_timer=60  >/dev/null 2>&1
    echo "."
else
    echo '(lspci/setpci not available!)'
fi
Normal latency set by the BIOS is 32, which is too damn small for IDE.
You may have to tweak the PCI ids a bit. You want all storage controllers
(both chipset, Promise and any extra cards). The IDs up there are for my VIA
kt133, and Promise PDC20265.
Oh, some of the PCI 'optimizations' in BIOS must be enabled for that to
actually help a bit. Stuff like the PCI caches.
VIA PCI is utter crap. I am not buying anything of theirs ever again :(
