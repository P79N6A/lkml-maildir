Naturally I hope you're right.  But how does that follow from the Standard?
I have to admit I don't have a copy handy.  :(
Let's say we have this simplified version of the problem:
	int a = 3;
	{
		volatile int b = 10;
		a += b;
	}
Is there really language in the Standard preventing the compiler from
constant-folding this code to "int a = 13;"?
