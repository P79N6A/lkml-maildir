There is some other iffy locking of the pid objects ever since they were
changed from pid_t to ref counted structs. Whoever did that didn't add
any locking for it, and the old code knew it was "safe" not to.
I've added locks in my test tree and now I've finally got -mm to build
will do some testing then push more stuff upstream
