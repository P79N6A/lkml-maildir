Unfortunately, I do not have these numbers present. You can check the
processor specification sheets at Intel's website, though.

They have different architectures, but again -- AFAIK -- throttling means STPCLK
is stopped, which is equivalent to the Stop-Grant state. And that's what's
usually entered in C2-type idle sleep.

That's exactly the opposite of what you should do, if idling works at least
reasonably well: only enter throttling if the CPU has some substancial
workload.

Most probably, the idle handler can't make use of the Stop-Grant state (C2)
here, so this is case a) noted above.
