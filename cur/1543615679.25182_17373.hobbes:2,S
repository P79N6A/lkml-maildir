it hasn't received the widespread use that mainline has.  I may be
forced to soon if the VM fixes don't get merged.

Well, the nature of the problem is that the timer "slows" and stops,
causing the machine to get more and more sluggish until it falls of the
net and stops dead.
I suspect that high IRQ rates cause the issue -- large sequential
transfers are not necessarily culprits due the lowish overhead.

I don't think it's intentional, and I realize that VM changes are hard
to swallow in a stable kernel release.  I just hope that the severity
and fairly wide negative effect is enough to make people more
comfortable with accepting VM fixes that may be somewhat invasive.
