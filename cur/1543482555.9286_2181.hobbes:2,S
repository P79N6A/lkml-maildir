Umm, I'm not sure if this is possible, but perhaps a way of running or
promoting a regular process in or to kernel mode might be the answer.  This
way gdb or any other debugger would be able to debug kernel code.  Maybe gdb
could be ported to run as a kernel module?  Another possibility would be a
kernel emulator or a way of running a test kernel in user mode for testing
and/or debugging.
