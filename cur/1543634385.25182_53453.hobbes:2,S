Subject: [patch] (resend) credentials for 2.5.23

This message didn't seem to get through the first time, so here it is 
again.  The patch is available for review at:
	
http://www.kvack.org/~blah/v2.5.23-cred.diff
Several parts of the kernel need to obtain a reference to the 
credentials of a process: aio, nfs, dirty mmap writebacks to 
name a few.  Additionally, POSIX threads need to be able to share 
credentials between clones.  The patch below moves the credentials 
out of task_struct and into struct cred, which is reference 
counted.  It also adds support for CLONE_CRED which shares the 
credentials between threads.  Comments?
