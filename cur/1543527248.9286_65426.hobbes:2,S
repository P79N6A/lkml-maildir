I run 2.3.46 on a BP6, Dual 466.  It works OK.  However even with the latest (QQ) bios,
ACPI is useless (It doesn't support S5, so you can't power off, and S1 does little
more than blank the screen...  I beleive this minimal support was added to allow 
Win2000 to work.  Also, acpid in debug mode reports a large number of errors parsing the config
data, which probably means it isn't truly ACPI compliant anyway...).
I have heard of people having problems with crashing, dma etc.  If you get problems like that
boot with the noapic option.
