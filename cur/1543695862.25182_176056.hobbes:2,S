Hi Bryan - known problem reported some weeks ago, but thanks
for the report anyhow.
Patch is present in my kbuild repository (linux-sam.bkbits.net/kbuild).
Linus has not applied them, since this is not critical fixes. I will
try to see when 2.6.1 comes out to get them applied.
Until then the relevant patch is attached here.

# Also do not duplicate CPPFLAGS. Previously it was appended twice to CFLAGS
