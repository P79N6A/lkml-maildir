I actually just scanned the tree, and outside of files that
only get built on CONFIG_SMP (namely, arch/${ARCH}/kernel/smp{,boot}.c)
the IPI functions were %99 marked static already and the remaining
%1 should be marked static.  The cases in that %1 group are:
arch/mips/sibyte/sb1250/prom.c:prom_cpu0_exit()
arch/powerpc/kernel/machine_kexec_64.c:kexec_smp_down()
And as stated, those two can just be marked static right now.
So we could very easily remove the CONFIG_SMP ifdefs, but the
-funit-at-a-time requirement to get gcc to not emit unused static
functions is very unfortunate.
Even tricks like marking the IPI function "inline" don't work since
we're taking the address of the function.
