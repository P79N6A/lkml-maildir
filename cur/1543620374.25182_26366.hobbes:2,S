Interesting ...
The question I raise is, how many locks do we have where we have a
single resource we lock where in some codepaths the lock is used for
short duration and in other places the lock is long-duration?
It would be useful to identify a few locks where this would benefit and
apply the appropriate combi variant and do some benchmarking.
Some of the talk I've heard has been toward an adaptive lock.  These are
locks like Solaris's that can spin or sleep, usually depending on the
state of the lock's holder.  Another alternative, which I prefer since
it is much less overhead, is a lock that spins-then-sleeps
unconditionally.

This can be bad.  What if I grab a spinlock in a codepath where only a
spinlock is appropriate (i.e. somewhere I can't sleep, like an irq
handler) -- and then I sleep?

Very true ... but only assuming we can find locks where there are
differing profiles of use.

You can't sleep in an interrupt request handler, so this wouldn't make a
lot of sense.

Non-exclusive wakeups are common ... see the uses of normal wake_up vs
wake_up_exclusive.

We shouldn't engage in wholesale changing of spinlocks to semaphores
without a priority-inheritance mechanism.  And _that_ is the bigger
issue ...
