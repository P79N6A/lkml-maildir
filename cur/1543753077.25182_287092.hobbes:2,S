Why would you want anything but read access?

I think random access is overkill.  Keeping the code simple is more
important and user-space can post-process it.

Auto-resizing sounds like a really bad idea.

And why can't you do this from that code?  It just needs an initcall-like
thing that runs after mounting of relayfs.
