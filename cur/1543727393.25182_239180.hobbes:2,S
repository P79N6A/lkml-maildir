UGA is essentially a PCI device.  It uses the EFI PCI I/O 
protocol which gets glued to the kernels pci layer...at least in 
a prototype.  
I haven't looked at the latest kexec patch.  How is it handling
the call to EFI's SetVirtualAddressMap()?  Is it part of the config
associated with kexec to do efi calls in physical mode only so that
it doesn't have to contend with potential follow-on invocations 
resultant from "the next" kernel's initialization?
