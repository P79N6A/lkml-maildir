good point. I dont think it's "evil" (or as Roman has put it, "bogus") 
in any way, and it should be up to the authors of the code to decide one 
way or another. [An added bonus for me is that in my editor the 'const' 
keyword is color highlighted, so const args are visually separate from 
non-const arguments]
