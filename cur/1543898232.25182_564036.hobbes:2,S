The pte_write() part is for the shared dirty page tracking. If you want
to make sure that a max of x% of your pages are dirty then you cannot
allow to have more than x% to be writable. Thats why page_mkclean_one
clears the dirty bit and makes the page read-only.

No, s390 is covered by the page_test_dirty / page_clear_dirty pair in
page_mkclean.
