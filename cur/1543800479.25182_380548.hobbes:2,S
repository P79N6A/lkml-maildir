I've been doing a little digging in my system since i was unable to get
DRI running on my current motherboard (see my prior posts regarding a
possible bug in agpgart), and i noticed that i don't get any lines
in /proc/mtrr expect for my main memory.
The entry seems correct, the size specified is also correct, however, i
don't get any write-combining lines.
This is what i get:
eg00: base=0x00000000 ( 0MB), size=1024MB: write-back, count=1
This is what i should get:
eg00: base=0x00000000 ( 0MB), size=1024MB: write-back, count=1
reg01: base=0xd0000000 (3328MB), size= 128MB: write-combining, count=1
reg02: base=0xf0000000 (3840MB), size= 128MB: write-combining, count=1
The required modules are loaded (agpgart & amd64-agp), but as previously
reported, amd64-agp is unable to read the proper aperture size.
As far as i've come to understand, these issue's are most likely
related, and quite possibly related to the motherboard BIOS, so i'm
wondering about any work-arrounds for this.
Cheers all
