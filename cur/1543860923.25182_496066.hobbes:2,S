I personally have never given a rats arse about "standards" if they make
no sense to me. If the server is capable of knowing about hard links,
then why does it need all this extra crap in the filehandle that just
obfuscates the hard link info?
The bottom line is that nothing in our implementation will result in
such a server performing sub-optimally w.r.t. the client. The only
result is that we will conform to close-to-open semantics instead of
strict POSIX caching semantics when two processes have opened the same
file via different hard links.

This has nothing to do with the protocol itself: it has only to do with
caching semantics. As far as caching goes, the only guarantees that NFS
clients give are the close-to-open semantics, and this should indeed be
respected by the implementation in question.
