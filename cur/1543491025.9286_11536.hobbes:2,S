OK, I could reproduce it:
kernel: __nfs_fhget: inode 218771 busy, i_count=2, i_nlink=1 
kernel: nfs_free_dentries: found //awajijo.jpg, d_count=0, hashed=1 
kernel: nfs_dentry_delete: //awajijo.jpg: ino=218771, count=2, nlink=1 
In this case, I copied the file to the NFS server (SunOS 5.4), and then
read it back a few times so it was buffered on the client (Linux 2.2.4).
Then I did some normal stuff for a few minutes, and then I deleted it from
the server side.  A while later, I tried copying that same file back to
the server, though giving it a different name.  At that moment, I got the
message above. 
I never saw this before 2.2.4. That NFS server has an uptime of 52 days,
and doesn't do much else besides a couple of rc5's (dual CPU).  The client
is an Alpha (PC164), 128M, no modules, Tulip ethernet.  Oh, I did add the
arch/alpha/kernel/time.c patch to fix the negative gettimeofday deltas --
it works fine here, but I doubt it's relevant.
The /etc/fstab entry for the NFS mount reads:
bhmeg:/home/bhmeg/tomh /home/bhmeg/tomh nfs timeo=14,intr,rsize=8192,wsize=8192 0 0
and it's been mounted since I rebooted yesterday.
