I dont think it will work. It will make utime monotic, but stime can still 
decrease. For example let sum_exec_runtime increase by a tiny little bit while
utime will get a full additional tick. stime is sum-utime. So stime can still
go backwards. So I think that we need this kind of logic for stime as well, 
no?
