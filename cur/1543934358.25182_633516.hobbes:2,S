otg whitelist is not a blocker. A device that is not listed on TPL
might or might not work. The logic around that should be something like:
parse_whitelist()
if (!listed) {
	match_class_with_tpled_devices();
		if (match_any)
			check_power_need();
			if (power_need <= 100mA)
				allow_enumeration();
			else
				deny_enumaration_and_message();
If you check n810, you'll see that even though a usb memory stick is not
listed on its TPL, we allow it to enumerate as long as it draws less
then 100mA and this is true on something around 95% of usb memory
sticks.
I'm kinda busy with other tasks right now, but when I finish formating
proper patches for current mainline head, I'll release some code adding
support for dynamic otg tpl. The problem I see here is that my only
"user" is musb driver, currently only available on linux-omap git tree.
Maybe it's time to send it to mainline, what do you think Dave?
In any case, I'll format such patches when I'm done with twl4030 and
isp1301 development, something around 3 ~ 4 weeks from now.
Even though, embedded hosts should have the same behavior.
