Once you have this, you might as well make that granularity
per VMA.
This gives you the advantage of being able to share the
mapping for libc.so ;)
From what I can see, you'll basically want large pages
for:
1) Oracle and maybe other large shared memory situations
   where the page table overhead would otherwise be
   prohibitively high
2) scientific calculations and other programs with a huge
   dataset where TLB misses would be prohibitively slow
