I should be able to give this a go over Easter on a PWS500au, which,  
IIRC, is a miata system.
As an aside, I have been using the ESS1888 on my XP1000 (in between  
system partition corruptions and restoring the system three times - I  
suspect a failing controller card which I have now removed) through  
the OSS interface for a couple of weeks without problems.  This is  
indicative that the ESS1888 problem may be specific to certain Alpha  
models.
