It's not a huge undertaking, I know, but UDP will probably still be
a bit simpler. Turn the question around: would using TCP bring any real
benefits, in a system which will only be used to shift a few kb each boot
time?
At a later date, perhaps TCP could be used - it would certainly make sense
for the kernel-side code: once you have a fully-fledged IP stack, why not
use it. There's no reason the server couldn't support both, and machines
would just use whichever was more appropriate at the time.
