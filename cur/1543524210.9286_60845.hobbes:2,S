Hi guys,
I can't select "BFS write support" in make xconfig, Config.in says:
dep_tristate 'BFS filesystem (read only) support (EXPERIMENTAL)'
CONFIG_BFS_FS $CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL
dep_bool '  BFS filesystem write support (DANGEROUS)' CONFIG_BFS_FS_WRITE
$CONFIG_BFS_FS
if BFS is compiled as module. Same thing with UFS and a few others that
use the above construct in fs/Config.in.
Shouldn't scripts/Menuconfig be changed like this (works for me)?

I never touched scripts/*fig* before so I might be completely off the
track here, but if not - then scripts/Configure will need modifying as
well....
