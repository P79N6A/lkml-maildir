Don't worry, this is the proper mailing list for bug reports.

No, looks like someone is feeding a bad pointer to slab. The debug
check is relatively new and in previous kernels the problem would
might have gone unnoticed causing silent corruption of the slab.

From Documentation/oops-tracing.txt:
"NOTE: ksymoops is useless on 2.6.  Please use the Oops in its original format
 (from dmesg, etc).  Ignore any references in this or other docs to "decoding
 the Oops" or "running it through ksymoops".  If you post an Oops from 2.6 that
 has been run through ksymoops, people will just tell you to repost it."
So, can you please repost the original oops? Also, please enable
CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB  and try to reproduce. Thanks.
