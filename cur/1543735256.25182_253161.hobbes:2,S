Subject: MORE: problem with initialization while accessing NFS mounted roo t file system during the Linux 2.6 boot

I also tried "read only" nfs mounting from Arabella's CD-ROM itself (by
modifying 'bootargs" in U-boot environment):
bootargs=root /dev/nfs ro nfsroot=192.168.1.100:/E/fadsroot
In this case booting hangs ...
...
Kernel command line: root /dev/nfs ro nfsroot=192.168.1.100:/E/fadsroot
...
     bootserver=255.255.255.255, rootserver=192.168.1.100, rootpath=
Looking up port of RPC 100003/2 on 192.168.1.100
Looking up port of RPC 100005/1 on 192.168.1.100
VFS: Mounted root (nfs filesystem) readonly.
Freeing unused kernel memory: 272k init
Warning: unable to open an initial console.
