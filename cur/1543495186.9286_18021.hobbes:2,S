OK, you're right about that one -- a slight brain fart on my
side. Then again, we probably want to make goodness() a bit
cheaper than it is now because we're calling it more often
than before....

I've got a new scheme in mind which uses a new variable in
the task struct in order to make goodness simpler, increase
the range of CPU usage (for niced tasks), favor interactive
performance better and get rid of the recalculation as a
nice side effect...
Btw, the rate of recalculation increases with more CPUs in
the machine so I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't scale
well to number crunching machines with a lot of nice +19
tasks.
Anyway, I think I can bring my point across much better in
C than in english, so I'll focus on some source code now...
cheers,
