Andrea,
FWIW, I have already written a program called cvsps (www.cobite.com/cvsps) 
which extracts 'patchset' information from cvs log output.  
Currently, this program doesn't work with the bk-cvs because the log 
messages that are committed with each file in a changeset can be 
different, and cvsps assumes the log message will  be the same.  
However, about a 5 line hack to my program (in progress) will allow it to 
recreate the ChangeSet information, since Larry has promised that the 
timestamps of all files touched by a changeset will be unique.
This might help you out.  I'll let you know when the '--bk-cvs' option has 
been implemented ;-)
David
