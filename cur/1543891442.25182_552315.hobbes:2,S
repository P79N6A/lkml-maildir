    Not a problem for me because I don't use GPM. I hate mice, and while
under X I'm forced (more or less) to use them, I don't use a mouse on
the console. I can blind type, so I prefer to keep my hands on the
keyboard. I work much more fast that way, and I haven't needed to copy
and paste between consoles ever.
    Thanks anyway for the warning ;)
