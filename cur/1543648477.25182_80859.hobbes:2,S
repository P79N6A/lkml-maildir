Indeed. I experienced the problem every 24-36hrs around five times in a 
row last week. Pretty much every morning, I'd come in and the box was 
completly dead. It seems to be okay at the moment, but I'm not holding 
my breath.

My box doesn't have a light, but what I got from SNMP before the box 
died suggested that the system (e.g. the 'system' CPU usage MIB) was 
using a considerable amount of CPU time (>95%), so I'm not sure if it 
was swapping madly, or if something else was going on.
