Code may 
	close (0);
	close (1);
	close (2); 
	... 
	malloc (); 
	/* Now open our controlling TTY/ stdin .. */ 
	fd = open (... ) ;
After taking care of this (*), problem I find the fd trick WAY more
appealing than Linus' magic numbers. With file descriptors we have a
"small integer which can be validated quickly". We also have storage
for a private pointer somewhere in the fd structure. 
If people are TOO afraid of breaking something, creating a new set of
small integers handled similarly as "fds" would do fine. (Maybe here
we'd allocate just a few, and reallocate when neccesary).
Roger. 
(*) I bet that 
	get_sem_fd () 
	{
	int rv;
	int fd; 
	fd = get_fd ();
	if (fd < 5) {
		rv = get_sem_fd ();
		close(fd);
	  	fd = rv; 
	  } 
	return fd; 
	}
will not break much. (UGLY coding. Don't tell me.)
