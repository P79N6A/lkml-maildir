So.
I realize I don't have much right to cry over spilled milk here, seeing
as this has been floating around for, what, four months now?
But seriously, if people are going to fuck around with extremely core
pieces of generic code, could they please check all the users[1]?
Other 64-bit arch maintainers should check that they're using a 32-bit
load/store on these fields in their assembly now (we were using a
#define to do word on 32bit and doubleword on 64bit, which broke, badly,
when these changed.)
Thanks,

1: Adding __deprecated or something to the field would give you an idea
of where it is used, in this case asm-offsets.c...
