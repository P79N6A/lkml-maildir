User error. It's actually INIT that's hanging, not the kernel.
When you installed on machine A, RH chose glibc libraries optimised
for i686-class CPUs. These libraries WILL NOT RUN on anything less,
including the P5 classic in your machine B, due to their use of the
CMOV instruction.
Move the disk back to machine A. Manually install the plain i386 glibc
library (glibc-2.2.4-19.3.i386.rpm if you get it from the RH7.2 updates
sites). Then move the disk back to machine B.
