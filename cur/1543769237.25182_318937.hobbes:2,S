Hi Grant,
Those are the sysfs names? If so something looks wrong with the
SENSOR_ ones..maybe an unintended effect of the new
sensor_device_attribute macro. I can't seem to find anything like that
in "gcc -I ../../../include/ -E adm1026.c" though, would you mind
sending me your script? Also make sure you are including the new
i2c-sysfs.h header file.
The group of attributes you've highlighted below don't use
sensor_device_attribute on purpose because they don't benefit from the
dynamic sysfs callbacks, mainly because they are singletons. Well its
possible you could roll all the attribute callbacks into one if you
wanted but that seems a bit extreme, and you'd have a large nasty
if-else going on in it :-).
BTW looks like a useful script :-), I'm always worried when doing
these changes I might accidently change a sysfs attribute permission.
Thanks,
Yani
