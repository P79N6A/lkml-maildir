Subject: kbuild: specifying phony targets?

I have a Makefile that works with 2.4 and 2.6 kernels.  On the 2.4 side, I have a rule 
like this:
all: mytext ${TARGET_DIR} ${TARGET_DIR}/ccil.o
mytext:
     @echo ${SOMETEXT}
This causes the text in variable SOMETEXT to be displayed right when the build starts.
How do I do the same thing with kbuild?  Is there a way I can get a kbuild makefile to run 
a phony target right at the beginning?
