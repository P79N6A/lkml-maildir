It's worse than that.  If vmalloc has to allocate a page table, the
allocation will be done as a non-atomic allocation.  So, even if you
do fix __get_vm_area_node and all the other cases, if you hit a page
table allocation you'll still get a warning.
Folk need to accept that using vmalloc from atomic contexts is a
complete nono.
