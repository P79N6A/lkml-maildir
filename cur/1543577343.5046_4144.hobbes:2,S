When I did some tests long ago, hdparm was hitting the buffer cache hash
table pretty hard in 2.4 compared to 2.2 because it is now smaller. However
as davem pointed out, most things don't do such things so resizing the hash
table just for this is a waste.
Since the hash is based on RAM, it may end up being big enough on the 128M
machine.

dbench was sleeping up to 1 second between starting the clock and starting
the benchmark. This made small benchmarks (ie especially dbench 1) somewhat
variable. Grab the latest version from pserver.samba.org (if you havent
already).

What exactly are you seeing?

I am seeing good results with 2.4 + samba 2.2 using tdb spinlocks.
