Just tested it on a SMP P200 system I have a home and got a weird behaviour
with directories.  I'm running autofs and it wouldn't start on the /home 
directory because it said it was in use.  I couldn't find anything that was
using it and nothing seemed to be mounted there so I decided to remove the 
directory and put a soft link in place so I could test the kernel.  Well,
it wouldn't let me remove the directory (no such file or directory) to do that.
I booted back to 2.2.10ac10 and everything works fine.
I can include .config settings if you think it might be useful.
