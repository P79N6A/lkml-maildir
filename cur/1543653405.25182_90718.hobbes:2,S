I have the same board, and the controller works fine for me in 2.5.4*, as 
2.4-ac doesn't contain xfs suport. I only have one drive attached, but as I 
remember I first had to configure the (raid) controller' BIOS (Ctrl-H at boot 
time) (even for just a bunch of disks) before using the drives. But I'm not 
100%ly sure.
I don't think there's any need for your patch, cause the hpt374 only has two 
channels, but there are two controllers on that board.
ANother QUestion: Did you ever get the onboard via-rhine NIC working with 
IO-APIC (both BIOS and kernel) enabled?
