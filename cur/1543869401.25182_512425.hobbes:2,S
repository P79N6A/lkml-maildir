I've tested the patch with slim.  The patch has been up and running
on my system for a couple of weeks now, and it seems to be working 
just fine.  Is the approach acceptable?  On the assumption that it 
is, how should we go forward with it?  Can it get a test run in -mm?
If not, what would be a more acceptable approach?
Thanks!
