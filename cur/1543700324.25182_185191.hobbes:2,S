OK, its probably not that then. Try the find command though, it would
be closer to what make/gcc is doing.

So it does sound like scheduling latency then. Its difficult to find
out what is happening with top and vmstat because they don't give you
an idea of individual scheduling events, which is what is important
for things like this. I'll have a look into making up a patch to gather
what I want to know.
In the meantime, I have a newer scheduler patch against 2.6.0 you could
try: 
http://www.kerneltrap.org/~npiggin/v28p1.gz
Try nicing the compile to +19 if it still stutters.
