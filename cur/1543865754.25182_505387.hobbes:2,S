Why do you think remounting filesystems is necessary? Are you getting
problems with some particular filesystem?
If I recall correctly, we briefly tried remounting filesystems in
Suspend2, but it created problems with logging - some files open r/w
were readonly afterwards. We then tried bdev freezing with much better
success.
