Hello!
> IPv6 behaves the same way.
Actually, Linux IPv6 filters received multicasts, inet6_mc_check() does
this.
IPv4 does not. I remember that attempts to do this were made in the past
and failed, because some applications, related to multicast routing,
did expect to receive all the multicasts even though they did not join
any multicast addresses. So, it was left intact.
