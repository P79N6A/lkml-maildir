Then in that case you should set the remaining drive as master. That's 
just the way PATA is. A lot of BIOSes won't even detect a drive that's 
set as slave with no master present.

Yeah, that's a better point. It's not really complaining, but we could 
probably have a better way of suppressing that message. I think it's 
largely there so that we can debug issues with drives not being detected 
when they should.
