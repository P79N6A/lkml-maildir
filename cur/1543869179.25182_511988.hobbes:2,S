At least tangentially related:
On one of my boxes (running 2.6.18-1.2869 from Fedora) I have a  
couple of other Maxtor drives that didn't like NCQ.   They are on a  
JMicron 20360/20363 (ahci driver).  (There's also a Promise 300 TX4  
card in the box and an Intel ICH8 that shows up with ata_piix).
model and (partial) firmware revision of the drives:
Maxtor 7V300F0  VA11
Maxtor 7B300S0  BANC
Until I disabled NCQ I got gazillions of messages like the ones below  
and absymal performance.
