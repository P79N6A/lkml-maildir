Some comments on the draft press release:
 Linux is a secure network operating system for demanding users. It
*interoperates with a wide variety of other systems. Linux can take
 advantage of modern high-end PC, PowerMac, Alpha, and UltraSPARC hardware
 while also breathing life into older low-end machines (even 386 and 486-based
 computers!). Linux can also fully realise the potential of supercomputers and
 their applications. One such example is the blockbuster movie "Titanic",
 whose dramatic 3-D scenes were rendered on an Alpha powered Linux system.
I feel one should specify the extent of advantage taken somehow.
Otherwise, it feels like a dumb 386/486 system trivially claiming that it
will run faster on a high-end PC.  Would "full advantage" be appropriate?
 Microsoft engineers Josh Cohen and Vinod Valloppillil, in a competitive
 examination of Linux (Halloween Document,
 <

 wrote that "Linux represents a
 best-of-breed UNIX, that is trusted on mission critical applications, and -
 due to its open source code - has a long term credibility which excedes many
 other competitive operating systems."
Correct spelling is "exceeds" instead of "excedes", I think.  Is "excedes"
really the quote? I can't find it in the mentioned URL. If so, you might
add a [sic] to indicate this.  However I understand there are sentiments
to drop the entire paragraph...

One of these two paragraphs will be removed, yesno?
Ciao.                                                             Vincent.
