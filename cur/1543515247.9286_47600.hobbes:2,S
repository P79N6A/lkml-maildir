Andreas,
In my defence, in May I contacted Alan Cox about this 
thinking it was a RH6.0 distro problem. He told me it 
was a glibc problem and gave me an email address (in 
cygnus from memory) to report the problem to. I did 
and heard nothing.
Report it, document it and supply work arounds... at
least the documentation finally got through.
Further, if glibc documentation says that "`/usr/include/net' and `/usr/include/scsi'
should *not* be symlinks" then why does
the latter directory contain old versions of scsi.h and sg.h ?
If they are Linux kernel headers (both are) then they should
either be controlled by Linux kernel distribution methods or 
not be there at all.

Yes, it causes problems for application writers, kernel 
maintainers as well as users.
