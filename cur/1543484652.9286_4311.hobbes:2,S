  Hi, all. I've just noticed a couple of potential problems in the x86
boot sequence:
1)  dodgy_tsc() is supposed to call cyrix_model() for Cyrix CPUs. But
    first it calls get_cpu_vendor() which sets the vendor code to 0xff
    (on my 6x86 anyway: /proc/cpuinfo appended). The result is that
    cyrix_model() is not called at this point, so the TSC capability
    flag can't be cleared
2)  check_bugs() calls identify_cpu() before check_cx686_cpuid() is
    called. Unfortunately, check_cx686_cpuid() initialises the
    capability bitmask using cpuid(), which means that capabilities
    set in cyrix_model() (called from identify_cpu()) are blown away.
    Perhaps the answer is to add extra capabilities after
    check_cx686_cpuid(), or perhaps it should be moved after
    identify_cpu()? But then moving it may cause problems? :-(
Does anyone have any comments on these points? Am I missing something
deep and/or subtle?
I find the whole x86 boot sequence pretty convoluted, with some
functions being called more than once and from different places. It
feels like a cleanup is needed: I'm having visions of a certain pasta
dish...
