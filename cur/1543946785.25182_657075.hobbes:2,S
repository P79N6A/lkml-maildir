Totally agreed.  I remember when I started getting hibernation bug reports 
against this new code and boggling at how hibernate was actually done.  The 
driver actually gets its ->suspend routine called twice with two different 
pm_message_t values.  We tried to do different stuff depending on the 
pm_message_t (like only putting the device in D3hot if PM_EVENT_SUSPEND), but 
it appears we're not doing enough...

Sounds like a good theory... now if we could just use set_power_state in the 
suspend case only.  That's what the latest code *tries* to do...
