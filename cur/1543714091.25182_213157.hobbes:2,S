I just want to say your updated C1 patch works for me.
A little history.
I got an ASUS A7N8X-X motherboard with a XP 3200+ CPU. For 3 days
the system worked fine with vanilla Linux 2.6.3 (no apic patch).
My workload consisted of web surfing and hacking. I built Xfree86
from source. No problems. Then I added an Adaptec 2940UW and a DAT
tape unit for backups. About 10-15 minutes into a backup, the system
would freeze. The freeze was 100% reproducible: I tried 6-7 times. 
I then upgraded to 2.6.5, applied your patch, and rebooted. I then
tried to do a backup: FREEZE!! What tha.....??? Ah, forgot to supply
idle=C1halt to the kernel. Supplied it, and did a backup: No freeze!!
Long story short, been running for two days, doing backups, etc. No freezes.
Here's my /proc/interrupts:
