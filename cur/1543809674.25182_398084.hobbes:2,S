which would just be a fancy name for a wider PID space, and would thus

i'm not sure i follow - what list is this and how would it be 
maintained?

so? Memory corruption can overwrite the futex value anyway, and can thus 
cause the wrong owner to be identified - causing a locked futex. This 
patch does not protect against bad effects of memory corruption - 
there's really no way to keep userspace from breaking itself.
