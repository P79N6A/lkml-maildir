Exactly. This is why I've changed my mind. In an effort to make it a little
less sucky all traces of the short names should be hidden from linux. It'll
then be sane if a little limited. You then have a couple of ioctls to read
and write the short names for programs that _must_ have them. (A shortname
write that would cause a collision will error)
Hopefully this is what Alexander will do, I don't see and problem living
with a "sfn_backup". Or with an LD_PRELOAD you could simulate the brain
damage and/or uglyness of any of the other schemes suggested here. (Mine
included)

Then they use the ioctls. 
In fact, Alexander,  be nice to them, provide one that gives the long
name given the short name ... as well as vis-versa. 
Remember they are already providing special code for VFAT partitons,
it shouldn't be too difficult to use a slightly more hidden (but still
documented) interface.
Well Alexander, is that the decision ?
