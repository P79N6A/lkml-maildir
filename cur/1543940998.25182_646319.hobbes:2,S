Subject: crypto/async_tx/* doesn't build on s390

I get the following:
crypto/built-in.o: In function `do_async_xor':
async_xor.c:49: undefined reference to `dma_map_page'
async_xor.c:56: undefined reference to `dma_map_page'
This is mainly because s390 doesn't support DMA at all,
but these files get selected via MD_RAID456 anyway.
Any idea how to fix this?
