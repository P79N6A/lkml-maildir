That will still consume up to 4 kilobytes per 32-bit counter.  We'd
need to merge Kiran & Dipankar's interlace allocator to do this less
grossly.
Which is why I'm waiting to see some profiles and benchmarks.  Judging from
the last set of profiles, in which ext2_count_free_blocks() was not present,
this may not be justified.
