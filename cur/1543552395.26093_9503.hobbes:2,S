No, I didn't say they "should" be dropped but merely that dropping them
would fix your problem.  Personally, I'd look closely at your setup to
determine exactly why this has become a problem.  named is being blocked
on writing to /dev/log.  This should only happen if there is sufficient
_local_ syslog traffic to fill the buffer or syslogd has too much remote
traffic to ever read from /dev/log.
Per chance are you running the name service caching daemon (nscd)?  I'd
also guess you aren't disabling fsync() for your sysylog files (it's part
of the syslog.conf format) -- this is a conciderable drain on syslogd.
