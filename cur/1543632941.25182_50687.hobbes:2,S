This is a mantra I keep hearing repeated, and it is a myth.  The correct
version goes more like: "in a realtime system, meeting deadlines is more
important than efficiency".  That doesn't mean you can't have both, and
please see my earlier description of the realtime system c/w gui, running
on a 486.  Oh wait, it also ran on a 386.  16 Mhz.

I mentioned somewhere that the realtime filesystem would get its own
volume.  That's a big help, because it means that the entire filesystem
can run in the RTOS, and we only have to worry about the block queue,
which is an interesting and tractable problem from the realtime point
of view.  Obviously, we want the RTOS to operate the block queue, and
yes, we want it to be efficient.
Our current block queue design would benefit a lot from the kind of
thinking that would be required to make it realtime.
