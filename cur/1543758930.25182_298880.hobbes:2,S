from what I have been able to find under /Documentation /proc/loadavg is 
defined as giving three loadaverage numbers, 1 min, 5 min, 15 min.
however as of 2.6.5ish timeframe there are a coupld of additional colums 
that do not appear to be documented
the first is something #/# that could be # of running processes/total # of 
processes, but I can't find a definition of this anywhere
the second new column I don't have any clue what it is.
is there some missing documentation or did I miss something in the 
existing documentation, and if so where should I look?
