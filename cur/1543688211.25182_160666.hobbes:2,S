Hello list-readers,
I've got some errors on a test-box with kernel 2.4.22 and apache. After
'apache start' I got a error in SSLMutex, that this function is not
implemented. I straced my httpd and know now, that the error occures on:
= = = = cutted many lines = = = =
gettimeofday({1061968634, 157158}, NULL) = 0
write(10, "[Wed Aug 27 09:17:14 2003] [info"..., 91) = 91
semget(IPC_PRIVATE, 1, IPC_CREAT|0600)  = -1 ENOSYS (Function not
implemented)
gettimeofday({1061968634, 157633}, NULL) = 0
write(10, "[Wed Aug 27 09:17:14 2003] [erro"..., 88) = 88
write(2, "Configuration Failed\n\n", 22) = 22
= = = = cutted the rest = = = =
With 2.4.21 everything works fine so I continue with old version.
Just for your information, may this error is false positive?
Greetings
Mike
