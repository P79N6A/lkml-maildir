Subject: 2.3.3 hangs on boot with "request_module[block-major-3] unable to find"

Does anybody have an explanation for me ?
2.3.3 on a K6-2 300 Via MVP3 IDE system hangs early in the boot with something
like
  request_module[block-major-3] unable to load
Which is rather astonishing as all ide stuff is built in and not modularized.
So any help in pinpointing the cause would be very appreciated.
