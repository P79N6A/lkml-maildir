I don't know what the problem is, but I couldn't help noticing these lines
of code look deliberately un-64bit-clean.  Is there a reason for this?
BTW, just for sanity check, where did these addresses "global_pci_memaddr"
come from?  They were read using pcibios_read_config_dword, right?

Silly question, but as Jeff suggested, when you tried readb you also tried
writeb, yes? :-)
