I agree of course.
What you are missing is that most 2.3.x testers have at least 32mbyte of
ram and my only point is that it would be nice to set the HASH_BITS
optimal for most of testers until the autotuning feature will be merged.
Otherwise the majority will have to increase HASH_BITS to tune the kernel
for their system (as I had just to do).
