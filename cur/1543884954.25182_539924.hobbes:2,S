Interesting, very different results from my system.
First, did you run with the properly TLB batched version of
the MADV_FREE patch?  And did you make sure that MADV_FREE
takes the mmap_sem for reading?   Without that, I did see
a similar thing to what you saw...
Secondly, I'll have to try some test runs one of the larger
systems in the lab.
Maybe the results from my quad core Intel system are not
typical; maybe the results from your 16 core Opteron are
not typical.  Either way, I want to find out :)
