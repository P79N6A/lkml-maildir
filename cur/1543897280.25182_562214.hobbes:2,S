I am slowly removing all parts of the in-kernel OSS with ALSA drivers 
for the same hardware.
The remaining drivers can roughly be divided into two categories:
- some ISA cards not supported by ALSA
- some drivers for unusual hardware (read: not a PC) not supported by ALSA
As long as we don't have ALSA drivers for them (which might in some 
cases never happen) I'd prefer to keep them for now.

I'm glad to hear this.  :-)
