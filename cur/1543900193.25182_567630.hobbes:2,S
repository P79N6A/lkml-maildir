That and they would be available within a specified limit. With grouping
pages by mobility, high order pages will be available but it's workload
dependant on how many there will be. This sort of predictability is
important for hugepages and memory unplug although it's of less
relevance to order-3 and order-4 users.

I think fsblock as it stands would gain from grouping pages by mobility.
It could use high order pages where they were available and fallback to
using the slower vmap approach when they weren't. I don't see why
highorder page cache and fsblock would be mutually exclusive. For that
matter, I don't see why any of these approachs are mutually exclusive
with what Andrea is doing other than having more than one way of
skinning a cat in the kernal at the same time might be confusing.
