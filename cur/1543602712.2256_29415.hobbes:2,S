Sounds like our 2.4.10's are different then.  :)
Without this patch, mine didn't create /proc/apm, register as a
misc device, or create the kapmd-idle kernel thread.
Must be a distro thingy.
Return of EAGAIN from the SUSPEND ioctl means that
send_event() failed, which means that some device driver
didn't want suspend to happen...which means that some
device driver got changed. :(
What was the last working kernel AFAUK (for this APM stuff)?
