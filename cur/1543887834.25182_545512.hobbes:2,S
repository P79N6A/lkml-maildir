Yes, this does get iVDR detection working again. The only problem seems
to be that every now and then I end up with this:
scsi0 : sata_sil
scsi1 : sata_sil
ata1: SATA max UDMA/100 cmd 0xfd000280 ctl 0xfd00028a bmdma 0xfd000200 irq 0
ata2: SATA max UDMA/100 cmd 0xfd0002c0 ctl 0xfd0002ca bmdma 0xfd000208 irq 0
ata1: device not ready (errno=-19), forcing hardreset
ata1: COMRESET failed (errno=-19)
ata1: reset failed (errno=-19), retrying in 9 secs
ata1: SATA link up 1.5 Gbps (SStatus 113 SControl 310)
So at least the drive detection works, but it would be nice not to
trigger this 9-second retry.
