    Some PPC boards use such clones -- you can see the comment in 
arch/powerpc/sysdev/i8259.c.

    Haha, here's an excerpt form CS5535 spec. update:
96. PIC does not support Polling mode
[...]
Implications: This mode is not normally used in x86 systems.
Resolution: None.

    Indeed, this would seem right but one step skipped -- where CPU tells 
northbridge that it's accepted an interrupt (via INTA).

    Yeah, another way of doing the missed step.

    Why not? AMD just decided not to implement poll mode, that's all.
