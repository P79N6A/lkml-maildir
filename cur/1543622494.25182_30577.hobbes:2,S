I can imagine some users (applications) wanting to insist on
staying on a particular CPU (Pike's Peak or Bust), and some
content to be migrated automatically, and some wanting to
receive and act on requests to migrate.
One of these policies might be default, with others as options.
Some CPU shut down operations _can't_ fail ... if they are motivated
say by hardware about to fail.
