	Hi. pppd works in 2.3.x. However you need pppd 2.3.9+. I have
been using pppd-2.3.10 with all kernels 2.3.x so far without problems.
In 2.3.x kernels the ppp module is 'ppp_async' for async lines
/etc/modules.conf reads:
alias tty-ldisc-3         ppp_async
alias char-major-108      ppp_generic
Also insmod/modprobe need to be upgraded [i use 2.3.6-10] . See Changes file
in linux source .
	Hope this helps.
	regards,
_ Abhay
