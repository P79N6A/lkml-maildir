Why should gcc spill a double (i.e. 64bit) as extended precision ?
Should it also do that with floats (i.e. 32bit) ?
The problem is not that only 64bit are spilled, but that
80bits are kept around (instead of 64) if not spilled.
If you want 80bit floating point precision, gcc might support
it with something like `long double'.
