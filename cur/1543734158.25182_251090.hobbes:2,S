The virtual synchrony APIs I propose we start with can be reviewed at:
http://developer.osdl.org/dev/openais/htmldocs/index.html
There is a sample program using these interfaces at:

Right now, the entire openais project with all the services it provides
consumes 2MB of ram at idle.  I'd expect under load its about 3MB.  The
group messaging protocol portion of that uses perhaps 1 MB of ram.  It
will reject new messages if its buffers are full, so it cannot grow
wildly.
Your definately correct; a virtual syncrhony protocol doesn't absolutely
have to be in the kernel.  In fact, it is implemented today completely
in userland with 8.5MB/sec throughput to large groups with encryption
and authentication.
You could gain some network performance by ridding UDP from the IP
header, but this is only 8 bytes.
There is little performance gain in using the kernel (as basically, a
kernel thread/process would have to be created to operate the protocol).
The only point of a kernel virtual syncrhony API is to standardize on
one set of messaging APIs for the kernel projects that require messaging
(and at a higher level, distributed locks, fencing, etc).
We want to avoid is two seperate messaging protocols operating at the
same time (performance drain).
We also want to choose wisely the messaging model and protocol we use. 
If we don't, we could have problems later.
