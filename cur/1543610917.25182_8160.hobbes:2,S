Has anyone yet written a loopback sound driver, that is a module that provides a
"fake" /dev/dsp that will actually save sound to file on disk rather than
playing thru a hardware sound card.  Or am I being stupid here?  Is there some
/dev trick I can play?
If no such module exists, could a kind soul point me at sound module
documentation/API.  I can find a lot of compatibility lists, but little
programming reference.  Or is there a very simple sound card driver that could
be used as a starting point?
Thanks
Joe.
