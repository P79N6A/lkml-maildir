Ingo,
Do you keep the RT patch as one slab or is it a series of patches 
(presumably managed by quilt)?
If the latter, could you make a break out available, much as Andrew does 
for the mm kernels?
This would make it much easier to isolate the various "neat" things and, 
possibly, send them on to Andrew/ Linus or where ever.
