Ok, that should be easy to debug... I hope :-)
Try to apply this patch to check what kernel part call connect function 
too many times. (Maybe it is some power management stuff?)
WARNING
It is my first "public" patch and I even not compiled it so maybe some 
headers should be declared. But if it will compile and run, it should 
display nice callstack in log for you for each call to this function. 
happy testing
Grzegorz
