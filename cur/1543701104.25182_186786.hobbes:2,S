Magical.
If it was the first five minutes, I'd not be horribly surprised, because 
we have a jiffies wrap at five minutes to try to find misuses of the time 
counter. But an hour? 
Just for fun, try changing include/linux/time.h, to make the
	#define INITIAL_JIFFIES ((unsigned long)(unsigned int) (-300*HZ))
just be a simple
	#define INITIAL_JIFFIES 0UL
and see if that makes any difference...
