	Hi,
drivers/media/dvb/b2c2/flexcop-dma.c uses the PCI DMA API, but DVB_B2C2_FLEXCOP
doesn't depend on PCI, causing the following problem on PCI-less systems:
| linux/drivers/media/dvb/b2c2/flexcop-dma.c:20: warning: implicit declaration of function 'pci_alloc_consistent'
| linux/drivers/media/dvb/b2c2/flexcop-dma.c:20: warning: implicit declaration of function 'pci_alloc_consistent'
Apparently this is the flexcop DMA core, which is used by both
DVB_B2C2_FLEXCOP_PCI and DVB_B2C2_FLEXCOP_USB.
DVB_B2C2_FLEXCOP_PCI depends on PCI.
DVB_B2C2_FLEXCOP_USB depends on USB.
Perhaps the flexcop DMA core should use the generic DMA API instead?
Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
