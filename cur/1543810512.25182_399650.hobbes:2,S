Subject: [PATCH] Add lookup_instantiate_filp usage warning

Hello!
    I think it would be nice to put an usage warning in header of
    lookup_instantiate_filp() to indicate it is unsafe to use it on
    anything but regular files (even that is potentially unsafe, but there
    your ->open() is usually in your hands anyway), so that others won't
    fall into the same trap I did.
