I am just catching up with my mail. Sorry about that.  I don't think
I understand your question completely. Let me answer, if I don't make
it clear ask me again.
The client and the server systems have the same level kernels. The CPU
utilization collected at server end is used to derive the throughput
scaled to CPU.  The throughput for tcp_stream reflects the rate of
transmits at the client and the rate of receives at the server.
