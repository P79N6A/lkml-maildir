Linus opinion on this is irrelevant. Neither I nor the FSF nor many others
have released code under anything but the vanilla GPL. By merging such code
Linus lost his ability to vary the license.
So it comes down to the question of whether the module is linking (which is
about dependancies and requirements) and what the legal scope is. Which
is a matter for lawyers.
Anyone releasing binary only modules does so having made their own appropriate
risk assessment and having talked (I hope) to their insurers
