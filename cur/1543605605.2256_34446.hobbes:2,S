I agree that for the normal user, plain messages are useless..   I remember 
something in Mandrake (7.0?), what they did is print a green [OK]  after 
every message and a red [ERROR] when something failed..  This was great for 
a quick visual check..   As soon as you see something red scroll past you 
know there's something wrong and you can check it later..
So this should really be left up to the distros..
