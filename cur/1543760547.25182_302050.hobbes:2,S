    We have some customers doing high performance raw I/O from various PCI &
VME cards.  They can already mmap() and do DMA from user space to the cards.
Allowing them to do interrupt processing in user space allows them to keep
everything in one tight package.  The ULI web site talks about this a little
more.
     						Thanks,
