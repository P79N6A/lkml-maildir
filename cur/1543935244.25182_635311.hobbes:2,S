That's fine.  I take it these patches will be funneled via
gregkh/pci-2.6.git.  There's some qla2xxx updates which are queued for
post-2.6.24 consumption in jejb/scsi-misc-2.6.git which don't appear
to have any conflicts.
I do though have a series of patches which I'll hold off on submitting
to linux-scsi until these PCI changes are merged, as there's some
minor conflicts merging the three branches.  James B, will that be
fine?
The patches themselves appear to be working fine within several of our
test rings.  I hold off on some of the cleanup post-merge time...
Thanks,
Andrew Vasquez
