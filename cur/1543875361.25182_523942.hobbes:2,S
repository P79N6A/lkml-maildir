This was on UP ARM systems, right?  Assuming that ARM CPUs respect the
usual CPU-self-consistency semantics, and given the background that
device accesses are ordered, then it might well be OK to have mb/rmb/wmb
be barrier() on UP ARM systems.
Most likely not on SMP ARM systems, however.

Not on UP.  On SMP, ordering is (almost certainly) required.

Again, for kernels built for UP, you might well be able to make the
mb() primitives be barrier().  I don't see it for SMP, though.
						Thanx, Paul
