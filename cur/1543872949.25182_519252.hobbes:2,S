Folks,
I'm getting this sort of message in my logs on occasion and my system
dies on me some time later.

Mar 13 09:06:37 localhost kernel: klogd 1.4.1#20, log source =
/proc/kmsg started.
Kernel is Linus' git tree as of 3 days ago (i.e. post 2.6.21rc3). I do
have some DCCP changes in there but those modules were not loaded at
the time.
I've had a quick look through lkml archives and can't find anything on
this in last few days. Apologies if I've missed something.
I'm not sure how long this has been occurring. I have been having slab
corruption on earlier kernels but they did not put an identifier on
last usage. This may have been issues with my Broadcom 4306 card as
this used to have lots of errors as well, until more recent kernels
where stability on that is much better.
My config is attached.
Please cc me on any queries as I'm not subscribed to lkml.
Regards,
Ian
