I don't know.  Anyone?  Will un/likely "break" in the above form?
Actually, it looks like assignments within conditionals are just prohibited
(even if you use double parentheses to shut gcc up :-).  It's not mentioned
in the CodingStyle, but it is in scripts/checkpatch.pl.  So I'll have to
take out all those assignments out of the conditionals anyway.  Good.  It
makes code more readable (and besides, most modern compilers will optimize
it just the same).
Cheers,
Erez.
