I found an 80188 on a Toshiba MK537FB. It was manufactured somewhere
in '93.
I remember we found a 68030 on the 1.6G Digital disks we installed
back in the early nineties.
I consider the "processor" already in place. I can't find any
"recognizable" processors on any modern drives. They all use a 
processor core on an ASIC that also does say "IDE interfacing". 
Hmm. Just the cost for adding an SODIMM socket? Plus the cost for
freeing enough PCB space. In addtion to that we need a suitable
communications interface.
