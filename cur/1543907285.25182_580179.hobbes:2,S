OK, good decision ;)
One approach would be for some brave soul to pick his way through
the reboot code and ensure that we are correctly and reliably setting
system_state to SYSTEM_RESTART, then test that in __might_sleep().
But this does suppress somewhat-useful debugging just because of sysrq-B
and I really wouldn't want to utilise the horrid system_state any more that
we are presently doing.  I think on balance that it would be better if we
could do something more targetted, like modify emergency_restart() to test
in_interrupt() and to then apologetically set some well-named global flag
which will shut up __might_sleep().  Pretty foul, but I can't think of
anything better.
