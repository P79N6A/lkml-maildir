This fix has been integrated with others in the ACPI patch,
and is available now in these bitkeeper trees:
http://linux-acpi.bkbits.net/linux-acpi-test-2.4.22
http://linux-acpi.bkbits.net/linux-acpi-test-2.4.23
http://linux-acpi.bkbits.net/linux-acpi-test-2.6.0
It is also available as a plain patch "acpi_pci_link_allocate" here:
