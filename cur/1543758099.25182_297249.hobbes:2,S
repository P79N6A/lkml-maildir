Yes, that makes things work.
Even better than ever before, now an USB mouse and a PS/2 logitech
trackball work fine both at the same time. In console and in X.
In previous kernels PS/2 was dead or jumped heavily when an usb mouse
was plugged. The keyboard works both in PS/2 (with adapter) and in USB.
Now a tricky question: the mouse and the trackball move the pointer in X
at different speeds. Is there any way to tell the kernel they have
the same DPI ? Or can I tweak the speed/DPI settings for them separately
to get a more or less similar movement ?
TIA
