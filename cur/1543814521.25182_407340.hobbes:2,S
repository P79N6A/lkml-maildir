This paper too claims that x86-64 has somehow different memory ordering 
constraints than regular x86. Do you actually have a source for that 
statement, or is it just a continuation of what looks like confusion in 
the Linux x86-64 header files?
(Also, x86 doesn't have an incoherent instruction cache - some older x86 
cores have an incoherent instruction decode _buffer_, but that's a 
slightly different issue with basically no effect on any sane program).
