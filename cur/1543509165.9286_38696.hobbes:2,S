<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>I am trying to read from and write to the I/O 
memory, in which a PCI board is mapped. As I could read in this mailing list, I 
used the function vremap (I am using Linux 2.0.36) to get the virtual address 
associated with the high PCI memory address, and then, I used the functions 
readb and writeb. Unfortunately, it seems not to work :</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>When I try to get the data page back from pte 
(using pgd_offset, pmd_offset, pte_offset and pte_page), I obtain something like 
0xF000F000, while the address I wanted to vremap was 0xFEA00000.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Furthermore, I noticed that the result of pgd_val 
was always 0.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 face=Arial size=2>(I control the fact that the 
read-access or the write-access doesn't work by observing some signals on the 
board).</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Where is the mistake?</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Thank you for your help</FONT></DIV>
