If the fastpath of the page allocator would be comparable in performance
to the slab allocators then page sized allocations could simply be
forwarded to the page allocator etc. IMHO this is how it should be ....
Right now slab allocators must buffer PAGE_SIZEd allocs due to page
allocator slowness.
