I see that hyphen as joining together two unlike fields rather than
separating them: maybe change it to a couple of spaces?  And the space
halfway through the string is more interfering than helpful (when that
field is useful, it's a string: which shouldn't have a spurious space
inserted).  Otherwise looks nice to me.
