Subject: Bug in i810 kernel module

Hello,
I would like to submit the following bug to the list.
I've compiled the brand new 2.4.1 with the i810 module (the one which plays 
mp3s 15% faster than the usual speed). I did a hack modifying this line into :
/usr/src/linux/drivers/sound/i810_audio.c and modified the clocking as 
follows : 
static unsigned int clocking=41194;
I don't think this why i got this behavior but using xmms sucked 98% of the 
CPU time reading either mp3s or ogg files. Something is definitly wrong with 
this driver as ALSA ones work just fine (xmms then uses only 0.5% of the CPU 
time).
hope it is useful.
Cheers
Steph
