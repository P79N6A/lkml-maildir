Double evaluation of the (addr) expression seems to be my problem, not 
register clobbering as I first thought. Although all the macro's that are 
using __put_user_asm also use
	__typeof__(*(addr)) *__their_local_addr = (addr);
	// further use __their_local_addr ...
one apparently needs to repeat this 'localization' of (addr) in order to 
have only one evaluation of (addr) at the end.
I always found the macro paragraph in my first C book -'A Book on C'- a 
little too short :).
Anyway, thanks to all for the help.
Frank.
