Ok thank you for your response.
I have included in the kernel the via82cxxx support.
Now when I boot , it was very slow and I have this :
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with idebus=xx
VP_IDE: IDE controller at PCI slot 0000:00:11.1
ACPI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A of device 0000:00:11.1 - using 
IRQ 255

VP_IDE: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later

Each dma_timer_expiry is long.
I have this at boot :
# hdparm /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
  multcount    = 16 (on)
  IO_support   =  1 (32-bit)
  unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
  using_dma    =  0 (off)
  keepsettings =  0 (off)
  readonly     =  0 (off)
  readahead    = 256 (on)
  geometry     = 65535/16/63, sectors = 78177792, start = 0
# hdparm -tT /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
  Timing buffer-cache reads:   924 MB in  2.01 seconds = 460.46 MB/sec
  Timing buffered disk reads:   20 MB in  3.08 seconds =   6.50 MB/sec
When active dma the disk access freeze during a long time and I have 
this error :
hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x61
hda: DMA timeout error
hda: dma timeout error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
and the performance is the same :
# hdparm -tT /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
  Timing buffer-cache reads:   948 MB in  2.01 seconds = 472.42 MB/sec
  Timing buffered disk reads:   20 MB in  3.08 seconds =   6.50 MB/sec
