I dont know if this is the right mailinglist for this so if not please point
me in the right direction, but here goes anyway...
Im trying to find out if theres a driver for the following NIC in the 2.6.x
series of the kernel
Product:           Intel PRO/100 Intelligent Server Adapter
Intel Part Number: PILA8480
Board # (PWA):     687231-xxx
It has a i960 coprocessor on it so im not sure if its supported at all...
The latest information i have found about it is from 1999 where it states
that this nic is not supported... 
Thanks in advance
