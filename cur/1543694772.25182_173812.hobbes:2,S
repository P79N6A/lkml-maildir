When did you purchase it ? Better : can you find the revision (black on 
white sticker glued in the corner of the motherboard near the last PCI 
slot) ?
There were electrical defects with the earliest K7S5A revisions (I 
returned one myself). Rev 0, 1, 2 and 3 are affected, I don't remember 
for 4-6 but IIRC rev 7 and above aren't affected : I have a rev 5 or 7 
at home (don't remember which one it is) and it works perfectly.
