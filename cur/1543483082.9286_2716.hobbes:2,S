When browsing thru the kernel sources recently I found that Linux seems
to have fundamental support for capability lists in the 2.2 kernels 
(I think it started in 2.1.something). Is there any documentation on the
use of those capability lists available or can anybody point me to the
group of people working on that particular part of code ?
Cause a split of administrative rights is one thing I'd very much like
to see in Linux and it's of course on of the first steps towards a
MLS-like kernel.
