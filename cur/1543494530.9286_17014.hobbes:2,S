Consider this: The professional programming community has taken a long
time (almost ten years?) to look at Linux as a useful, viable product. 
Only recently have the commercial software giants begun to endorse it,
and only with reservations - you still have to ask for Linux when you
buy a machine from Compaq or Sun.  Is it possible that Ken's remarks
might have something to do with this?
Knee-jerk reactions like "he must be on drugs" or "he doesn't know what
he's talking about" are kind of strange when directed toward an
accomplished software professional like Ken Thompson, especially
considering that he is not only the co-creator of UNIX but that he
worked on it for years improving it to a point where one of the biggest
software giants of all, AT&T, began to market it.  AT&T made a fortune
on UNIX until they sold it.  That says a lot.
The real question is: how many of you will look at this with an open
mind?
Isn't there (a LOT of) room for improvement in Linux?  If not, why are
we moving towards 2.3 and beyond with an eye toward CORRECTING some of
its flaws?
