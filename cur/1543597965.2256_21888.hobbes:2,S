I think i'd have to disagree. I have a PII-450 with a cheapo Vanta card
in it, and i run GL apps ranging from Quake 3 to various GL programs of
my own... no hangs. And i leave my system for days on end with a GL
screensaver running. Still no hangs. I've used NVidia drivers all the
way from 0.9-6 to 1.0-1251 and i never got that kind of instability.
