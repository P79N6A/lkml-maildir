Subject: [PATCH] Trivial fix for type mismatch warning in riotty.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
following warning encountered in 2.6.11-mm4 but it doesn't seem to
show up with this tree. Rather than casting i made it unsigned
since it doesn't have a signed usage. Some cosmetic changes done
also.
...
drivers/char/rio/riotty.c: In function `riotclose':
drivers/char/rio/riotty.c:672: warning: comparison of distinct pointer
types lacks a cast
...
PS: I've also found a fix [1] including this one but it's not in
mainline as i see.
