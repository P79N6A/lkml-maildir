I didn't suggest the compiler could or should do it, just that it would 
be possible (for the _user_) to write portable ISO C code to access PCI 
mmio registers, if volatile's implementation serialized access.
With the current implementation of volatile in gcc, it is impossible - 
you need to resort to inline assembly for some architectures, which is 
not an ISO C feature.
And I'm not suggesting that it would be a good idea to use volatile even 
if it was corrected - it would have to take a worst-case approach and 
thus would generate very bad code.
