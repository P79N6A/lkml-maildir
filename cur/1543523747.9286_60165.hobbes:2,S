Many database products let you spread a database over multiple files, in
which case the 2GB limit isn't necessarily a problem.  If you really
want a single file larger than that, then for 2.2 you are limited to
using a 64-bit platform such as Alpha or Sparc64.  2.4 will support
larger files on ia32, too.
