Don't rule out hardware. This SuSE 10.0 x86 box worked without problems 
on kernels up to 2.6.15-rc6-git2, but I experienced strange apparent 
filesystem corruptions/compile failures running normally and hard 
lockups when running mythtv with 2.6.15-rc6-git6 and 2.6.15-rc7, while 
on the Mandriva 2006 x86 box and the SuSE x86_64 there were no problems. 
Until I found the suspect SDRAM, on some occasions I had to run 
reiserfsck before 2.6.15-rc6-git2 would boot again correctly after 
trying rc6-git6 or -rc7. Finally I got a corruption again with 
2.6.15-rc7, replaced the SDRAM stick with the one taken out previously, 
booted up on 2.6.15-rc7 with no problems. I had run memtest some days 
earlier, but only for a couple of hours. (current uptime 1 day 1.04hrs).
Regards
Sid.
