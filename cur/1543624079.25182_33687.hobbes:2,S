I will tenatively vote in favor of this kind of action.  There
are a couple of directions to consider.  This is a two dimensional
problem.
Dimension 1.  Different basic hardware architectures. 
  (pc,numaq,visws,voyager)
Dimension 2.  Different firmware implementations.  
  (pcbios,linuxbios,openfirmware,acpi?)
And beyond that it is fairly important to be able to build a generic
kernel.  That works on everything.  You might have to specify a
command line parameter to tell it which arch it is really running on
but it should work. 
From working with the alpha I can say that it is just nasty when you
must have per motherboard information in your kernel.  Generally life
is much more pleasant if a small handful of things like irq routing
information is provided by the firmware so you only have to code for a
specific hardware device, and not a specific motherboard.  
And even if we get to the point of putting in motherboard specific
code I would suggest it just provide the information like irq routing,
and which superio chips are present and allow a more generic layer to
handle their setup.
Anyway on the multiplexing the firmware score I have just done the
heavy lifting needed so we can put the firmware switching logic 
all in C code.
