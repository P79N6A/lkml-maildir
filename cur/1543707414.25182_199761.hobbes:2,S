I can't get rivafb to work on my GF-MX440! Am I wrong in thinking that
CONFIG_FB_RIVA is a drop-in faster replacement for CONFIG_FB_VESA? Or do
I need both of them compiled in? All I get when trying to boot is a
blank or a messed up screen. The penguin is there though :) Here's the
relevant lines of my lilo.conf:
vga=0x317
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.3
       append="video=rivafb:1024x768-16@60"
$ lspci

01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV17 [GeForce4 MX
440] (rev a3)
TIA!
