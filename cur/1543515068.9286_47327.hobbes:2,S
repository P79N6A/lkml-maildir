Ok, I have implemented and tested this (tested ext2 only).  I did it
without a new system call and it's quite backward/forward compatible.  I
put the d_type value at the end of each record from getdents(), in such
a way that it can be recognised unambiguously.  Patch available on
request.
These are the results:
  - You forgot the S_ISSOCK case in ext2_set_de_type.
    e2fsck knows about it, but new unix domain sockets are untyped...
[treescan is equivalent to "find" with no predicates: it prints the
names of all the filesystem entries it can find]
  - With nothing in memory, treescan takes about the same
    time to scan my disks with the d_type information as it does with
    the O_DIRECTORY filetype optimisation.  2% CPU, ~53 seconds.
    This is no surprise.  Both methods avoid reading non-directory
    inodes, and in this case the system is I/O bound.
  - With everything in memory, treescan takes 0.41 seconds to scan my
    disks with d_type information, and 1.06 seconds with the O_DIRECTORY
    optimisation only.  100% CPU.
    This saving must be due to fewer system calls and fewer directory
    lookups.  Note, I do not have any large directories on this system.
