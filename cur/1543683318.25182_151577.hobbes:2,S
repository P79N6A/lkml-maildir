The man page says:
       timeout  is  an  upper bound on the amount of time elapsed
       before select returns. It may be zero, causing  select  to
       return immediately. (This is useful for polling.) If time­
       out is NULL (no timeout), select can block indefinitely.
But I did (obviously) try adding one just in case -- the problem does
not go away.

I just added that when trying to trace the problem and reading
somewhere that ISSET must be used...  It never had any effect -- never
exits and otherwise the program is still on a busy spin in Linux and
fine on Solaris.

Uh, that's just a stripped down example -- in the original the
returned value is checked and the write is retried if the result is
EINTR.  The problem is that AFAICT, select should wait until the fd is
writable, but then write fails with EAGAIN, only to have the next
select succeed as if there is no problems.

Yeah, when the problem occurs, write will result in an EAGAIN, but
the next select should block until writing is ok.
When I played with this now I saw another strange thing -- when there
is a timeout in place, the FD_ISSET *will* return 0 after some output
was done (probably when its waiting for output).  So I thought that it
might be a good place to put a sleep, but the problem is that 0 is not
returned when the output is stopped.
This is the program:
======================================================================
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <errno.h>
int main() {
  int flags, fd, len; fd_set writefds;
  struct timeval timeout; timeout.tv_sec = 1; timeout.tv_usec = 0;
  fd = 1;
  flags = fcntl(fd, F_GETFL, 0);
  fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, flags | O_NONBLOCK);
  while (1) {
    FD_ZERO(&writefds);
    FD_SET(fd, &writefds);
    len = select(fd + 1, NULL, &writefds, NULL, &timeout);
    if (len<0) exit(1);
    while (!FD_ISSET(fd,&writefds)) {
      sleep(1);
      FD_ZERO(&writefds);
      FD_SET(fd, &writefds);
      select(fd + 1, NULL, &writefds, NULL, &timeout);
      if (len<0) exit(1);
    }
    do {
      len = write(fd, "hi\n", 3);
    } while ((len == -1) && (errno == EINTR));
    if (len<0 && errno==EINTR) exit(2);
    /* if (len<0 && errno==EAGAIN) exit(3); */
  }
  fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, flags);
}
======================================================================

That was the point I was trying to make.

This doesn't solve the problem, and as evidence, the code will look
ugly with special cases for terminal output.
