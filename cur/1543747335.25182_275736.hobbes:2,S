And if we don't have userspace yet? (No initrd/initramfs).
The language issue is a good point; the whole issue of kernel messages
and languages needs a more general solution.
It probably also helps to remember the point to this:
- avoid file system corruption
- give the user a chance to confirm/fix actions that look wrong
Would making interaction a compile time option make you happy? (That
said, I'm not looking forward to trying to guess what the system should
do in some of these cases if not allowed to ask).
Regards,
Nigel
