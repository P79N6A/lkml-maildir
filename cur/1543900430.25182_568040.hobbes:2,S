Rafael's probably just gone to sleep, so let me be so bold as to give an 
answer.
First, you need to understand that there is a difference between the process 
freezer and driver support for suspending and resuming. The two are 
completely unrelated. Process freezing happens at the start of a hibernation 
cycle. Driver suspend and resume calls happen prior to and after an atomic 
copy or restore. Process freezing stops processes. Driver suspend and resume 
calls tell drivers to save their state and possibly enter low power modes. 
Process freezing isn't a necessary prerequisite for calling driver 
suspend/resume routines. (That has been the point to discussions about 
suspend to ram).
Since this is the case, doing grep -i freeze drivers/*/* is a bogus test. If 
you want to look for drivers using the freezer, you need to grep for 
try_to_freeze and PF_NOFREEZE. PF_NOFREEZE says the related kernel thread 
shouldn't be frozen (11 hits in the source tree I'm looking at). Grepping for 
try_to_freeze gets 29. By the way, find drivers/ -name '*.[ch]' | xargs grep 
try_to_freeze (for example) is a better search - it isn't dependant upon the 
number of subdirectories.
You'll see from the above numbers that the freezer is not nearly as intrusive 
as you were thinking (~10% of what you wrote above). It is limited to code 
related to kernel threads, and then to either setting a flag when the thread 
is started to say "I don't need to be frozen" or to the appropriate point at 
which to check whether to freeze.
Hope that helps.
Nigel
