I don't think I have to tell you that things got "really weird" for a
while which is why I took the route of most severity and elected to use
extreme debugging methods. :)
I mean, some of those stack traces kept triggering a jumble of schedule()
calls, etc... I decided to hack the heads off of them one at at time and
stop the kernel immediately after one of those bugs. The immediate panic()
is what caught the tbl raw_spinlock issue and therefore my lock reversion
after auditing that portion of the lock graph.
