Ah, now I see where the misunderstanding comes from. My bad.
I would merely like to save NO_THREADS * 4k, not the full 8k. People
here are migrating from Readtime OS's to Linux, partially and I
wouldn't think about introducing hard priorities into the scheduler
either. "This is plain impossible." is a very good argument for
education. "This only works under certain conditions." is where people
always demand more, sometimes rightfully, sometimes not.
