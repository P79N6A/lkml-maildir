looks like this introduces the error:

    [POWERPC] QE: automatically select QE options
    Change the Kconfig files so that the Freescale QE options are automatically
    selected if a QE device is selected.  Previously, you'd need to manually
    select UCC_FAST if you want any "fast" UCC devices, such as Gigabit Ethernet
    Now, the QE Gigabit Ethernet option is always available if the device has a
    QE, and UCC_FAST is automatically enabled.  A side-effect is that the
    "QE Options" menu no longer exists.
