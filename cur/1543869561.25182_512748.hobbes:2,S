Subject: generic one-shot bug (was Re: sparc generic time / clockevents)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

As I suspected, the one-shot code wasn't very well tested and I'd be
the one to debug this thing on sparc64 :-)
When a timer exceeds the timer period, the one-shot handling code does
the following loop:
	for (;;) {
		ktime_t next = ktime_add(dev->next_event, tick_period);
		if (!clockevents_program_event(dev, next, ktime_get()))
			return;
		tick_periodic(cpu);
	}
So it just keeps running tick_periodic() until we "catch up".
Problem is, if clockevents_program_event() gets a "next" time in the
past, the very case where we'll loop, it DOES NOT update
dev->next_event.  It returns the error before doing so.
As a result of this, we'll loop forever here, the softlockup watchdog
will trigger, and the system will wedge completely.
I was getting a softlockup and immediate system hang, so to debug this
I kept a history of the last 8 TSC values when tick_periodic() was
invoked.  At softlockup trigger, I'd dump the log.  And what I saw
were TSC deltas that we so tiny as to be just enough to indicate
tick_periodic() was running in a tight loop :-)
I propose the following fix, which I'm about to test.
