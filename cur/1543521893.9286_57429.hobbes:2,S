Personally, I think we should avoid the dependency, and put up with the tiny
amount of extra time it takes in non-critical code paths - if it's trying a
request_module but kmod isn't present, then it's almost invariably going to
fail to do what it was intending to do anyway - so who cares about a few extra 
cycles?
But The Master will speak, or more likely he'll just do what he thinks is best 
and we'll work it out from that :)
