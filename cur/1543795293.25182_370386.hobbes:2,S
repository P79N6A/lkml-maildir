Yes, there is only 1 active console at one time.  And many multi-head
users has been asking (and confused) about this for some time now.

Well, you really don't need to store currcon_ptr in fbcon_ops.  Using
vc_cons[ops->currcon].d should be enough to get the current vc attached
to the framebuffer.  It will also make your patch smaller, and hopefully
easier to spot regressions.

Yes, the console code is very confusing.  I have been looking at it for
a long time and I still don't know every code pathway it's going to take.
Anyway, with single-head systems, I can't really see your patch causing
regressions, so that's good.  With multi-head, I don't know.
Anyway, maybe Andrew can give this a whirl in the -mm tree?  Just resubmit
the patch without the currcon_ptr from fbcon_ops. And add a
Signed-off-by: line.  See:
