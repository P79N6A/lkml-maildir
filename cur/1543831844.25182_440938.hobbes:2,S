Yes, I got most of that.  :)

Yes, I already understood that.  I was interested in Arjan's
specific example, which was:
if (foo())
	zyzzy();
in which he supplied the terminating semi-colon, and which Andrew
explained with the -W warning...

OK, good practice, yes.

Yes, I have the () macro practice down.  I was just looking for the
problem with that one specific example, which you and Andrew have now
explained.  Thanks.
