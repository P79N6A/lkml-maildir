Subject: [PATCH 000 of 14] knfsd: Assorted nfsd patches for 2.6.20 - prepare for IPv6 and more
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Following are 14 patches for knfsd that are suitable for inclusion in 2.6.20.
First 13 are from Chuck Lever and make preparations for IPv6 support (I think we've
get them right this time).
Last is from Peter Staubach and fixes and issue with exclusive create
interacting badly with some ACLs.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
