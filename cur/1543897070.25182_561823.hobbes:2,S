I really don't understand why this should be needed in first place.
Where is the problem with using tristate? Nobody forces anyone to set it 
to 'm' if you don't like it. I could also argue it easily allows me to 
quickly restrict enclosed options to module status. It's just another 
choice, where is that fascination coming from that it has to be an on/off 
switch?
Whether the config option is visible in the Makefile and produces any 
code, is completely irrelevant in this context, as the user trying to 
configure the kernel has no idea of it.
bye, Roman
