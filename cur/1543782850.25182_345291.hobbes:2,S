Looks pretty good to me.  Small issues I've identified:
 - what do you need the hba_count attribute for?  This should be
   implementable in userspace pretty easily by iterating of all
   devices of the scsi_host class that are attached to the driver
 - the ->queuecommand cleanup patch I sent you a awhile ago doesn't
   seem to be applied
 - there's quite a lot of slightly odd formating, it would be nice
   if you could run the code through scripts/Lindent.
If you could sent out an unmangled patch (even as attachment or on
LSI's ftp side) I'd like to take another, closer look.
