That's definitely not a requirement.  For systems like voyager whose
CPUs cannot be renumbered it makes no sense.  The original reason for
renumbering was that most CPU loops ran from 1 to max_cpu and therefore
worked better if the CPU map was dense.  However, I fixed that up long
ago so sparse CPU map traversal should be fine now.
