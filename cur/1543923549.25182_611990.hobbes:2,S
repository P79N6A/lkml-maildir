The host can communicate to the guest what clock to use: the guest can decide 
to register a paravirt clock or not depending on whether it wants to leave it 
to the TSC.
For a while we couldn't remove the TSC cpuid capability in the guest, because 
if you configured your kernel in some ways it was hardcoded on.  I think 
the "all 686+ have a tsc" assumption has now been fixed, so I should change 
the lguest clock to do as you said: register its clock at lower prio to the 
TSC and then the host can simply remove the TSC cpuid if it isn't suitable 
for the guest to use.
ISTR the core TSC timing code (which lguest could use) and various hardware 
manipulations (which lguest couldn't) were intertwined, but I'll have to go 
back and check exactly what the issue was.

Unfortunately, you and Thomas both acked the patch.  This says v bad things 
about how much review kernel patches get.
Cheers,
Rusty.
