Can you get anything out with sysrq-t? The original oops would be
enough to conclude it's a double-free if it weren't for this:
    if (stuffp->toc) {
           kfree(stuffp->toc);
           stuffp->toc = NULL;
    }
While the code is obviously unsafe, we would have to be interrupted
between the read and the assignment, but you don't even have preempt
enabled! So I don't quite yet see where the concurrency is coming
from.
What you can do here is protect the above sequence with a spinlock,
for example, which might paper-over the double-free enough to get you
running again...
