We need that alloc anyway, to gauge the current memory pressure.
Sure you could perhaps not do that for allocations are are entitled to
the reserve if we still have on; but I'm not sure that is worth the
bother.

Well, that is currently not done either (in as far as that __GFP_WAIT
doesn't sleep indefinitely). When you run very low on memory, some
allocations just need to fail, there is nothing very magical about that,
the system seems to cope just fine. It happens today.
Disable the __GFP_NOWARN logic and create a swap storm, see what
happens.

/me fails again..
Its about ensuring ALLOC_NO_WATERMARKS memory only reaches PF_MEMALLOC
processes, not joe random's pi calculator.

It works exactly as it used to; if you can currently get out of a swap
storm you still can.
