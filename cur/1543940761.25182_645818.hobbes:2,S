dmaengine punts to the dma-mapping api.  So no, there are no alignment
guarantees.  The performance loss is probably more related to the
cache synchronization overkill of get_user_pages().  I/O incoherent
architectures end up synchronizing entire pages when we only need to
sync a kilobyte or two in this path.
