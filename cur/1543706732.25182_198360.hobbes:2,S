I do. (That is, 80xN with N in 24..60 or so.)
The 80 here has a pedagogical and a practical purpose.
The practical one is that it makes sure that everybody can read the source.
The pedagogical is to invite you to arrange the code in a different way
if you are nesting too deeply or your expressions are too complicated.
There is also ergonomics. There is a reason newspapers do not print
text across the full width of the page - it would be very difficult
to read. There is an optimal column width. One might fight over the
exact value of the optimum, but 80 columns is not a bad choice.
