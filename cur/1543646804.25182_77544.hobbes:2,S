Devices do physical readahead, and it works nicely.
Go into ext2_new_inode, replace the call to find_group_dir with
find_group_other.  Then untar a kernel tree, unmount the fs,
remount it and see how long it takes to do a
	`find . -type f  xargs cat > /dev/null'
on that tree.  If your disk is like my disk, you will achieve
full disk bandwidth.
