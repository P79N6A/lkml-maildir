I'm testing -rt10 right now (your binary rpm). Looks like the number and
length of the xruns went down, at least for now. All below 2mSec - jack
is running 128x2 @ 48000Hz. I'll let it run for a while and report the
traces (I have a script that collects all traces above 60us, but not all
xruns trigger a trace).
