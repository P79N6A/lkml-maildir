I'd change it back to the full Microsoft quote.  Ellipses in a quote from a
competitor that makes you sound good are always suspicious.
Besides, it's a quote.  Trademark violation issues shouldn't apply.

Change SAMBA to Samba.  Also, I liked it better with NT instead of Windows
NT, so you could attribute the TM to Northern Telecom.

Loose the sentence about where to get it.

I'd loose the "class of".  It's confusing to idiots, and that's who press
releases are for....

This needs changing to something like " high-end Intel, Apple, Digital
Alpha, and Sun UltraSPARC hardware".  People don't know what x86 or IA32
stand for.

The best-of-breed part was the best part of the quote.  If you have to use
ellipses, just omit the UNIX.  Best-of-breed can be a noun as well as an
adjective.
