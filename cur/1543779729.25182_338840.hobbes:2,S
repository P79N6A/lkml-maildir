I tested this patch by switching the kjournald to FIFO prio 30 and doing
a make of the kernel and "find / -name vmlinux", but this took 40
minutes to cause the deadlock.  Attached is a dumb module that creates a
thread and spins. If you want to test my softlockup detect, this will
trigger it.  The thread that is created is not RT so you can still do
work. My detector doesn't care if something spins in the kernel as an RT
task or not, it will flag it regardless.
