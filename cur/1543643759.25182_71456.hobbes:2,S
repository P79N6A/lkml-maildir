Subject: [PATCH 2.2] Add ALi 5451 gameport support to joy-pci.c

Hi!
This patch adds support for the gameport found in ALi 5451 chips to
drivers/char/joystick/joy-pci.c. It's basically the same as the 2.4-ac
patch I sent last week - just adds the PCI id to the driver and the
chip name to the help texts. The gameport itself works just like the
one found on Trident 4DWave cards.
Doesn't really touch any code, so I think this is okay for inclusion
in 2.2., right? It works on my machine.
