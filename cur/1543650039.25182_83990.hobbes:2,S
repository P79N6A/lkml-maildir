I think you own these two gentlemen a great big apology.
Their changes were cleanups and relevant to everyone.
How come you didn't flame Doug Ledford or Jens Axboe
when they broke the build of a few scsi drivers due to
their changes, or anyone else for that matter?
Furthermore, even a 2 second glance by a competent C programmer
can get these driver builds fixed, in fact what you end up needing
to do is deleting the lines the compiler is complaining about.
Again, you owe these people an apology for your childish outburst.
