How can you get an application to recognize those special Windows keys
that the newer keyboards have (usually where the CTRL/ALT keys are)?
The scan codes are:
   Left Window Key: 0x5B
   Right Window Key: 0x5C
   Menu Key: 0x5D
Would there be a way to use the Windows keys as additional shift-state
keys? Apps could have exclusive use of these, unlike the Shift/Ctrl/Alt
keys. 
My keyboard also has a special set of Internet keys, used for browser
functions. Is there any way to get an app to see these as well? They don't
generate scan codes, at least, not that I can determine.
