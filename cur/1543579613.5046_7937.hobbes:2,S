Well, the easises way of course is to have the internal cluster network on
another network card than the external load balancer. This will remove the arp
queries on their interface. But of course the back channel will be a bit more
delayed.
Another option is to ifconfig -arp the eth0 interface. I browsed through the
IPv4 code and did not find any other goto out which can be configured besides
the input FIB, which messing with is a bad thing since it wont accept the
packet at all.
so ifconfig -arp is the only option i could find which will help you. You need
to hardcode the arp entries for the real ip's of those web servers to reach
them.
