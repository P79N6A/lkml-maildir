> I don't have a problem with the rtc driver delaying 500ms
I still haven't looked at things, but two points:
(i) is the behaviour constant on all architectures?
(ii) instead of waiting, isn't it much easier to redefine
what it means to access rtc?
(If you read a certain value then on average you are halfway
that second; if you write a certain value you are precisely
halfway that second. Maybe no delays are needed or desired.)
