Currently the drivers queuecommand routine works the following:
 1) perform some checks
 2) try to post outstanding ccbs
 3) grab new ccb from freelist and set it up
 4) try to post new ccb, else enqueue it
there is not poin in having such a pending queue in the driver because
the midlayer does that work for you.  If ->queuecommand can't immediately
post a ccb you should return
 SCSI_MLQUEUE_HOST_BUSY   if there is a resource shortage at the hba level
 SCSI_MLQUEUE_DEVICE_BUSY if there is a resource shortage at the device level
and the scsi midlayer will try to send the command again once a command
has been completed on the hba/device.

struct CCB is a structure that is passed to the hardware but contains
pointers which have different sized on different architectures.  This
is generally very dangerous.  If this is just a cookie that the hardware
doesn't interpret at all it needs more documentation.  Also the way
you try to convert from bus to virtual addresses with pACB->vir2phy_offset
can't work on many linux platforms because the virtual to bus address
mapping isn't contingous.  you need a separate dma mapping for each ccb,
a good way to archive that is the dma_pool_ * API.

generally we don't want to add new ioctls.  For scsi/raid drivers there's
been an exception where we allow a pass-through to the firmware which
the managment applications need.  the driver has various ioctls that
don't seem to fall into that category.
