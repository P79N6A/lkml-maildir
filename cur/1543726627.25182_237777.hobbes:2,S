It works for me, in that I can now boot while docked, and I can use the 
CD-ROM in the base station.  /proc/ide/triflex produces several kB or 
binary garbage, but all other files under /proc/ide show sane output.
It has been running stably with 2.4.23 for several months (since Bart's 
sent the patch).
