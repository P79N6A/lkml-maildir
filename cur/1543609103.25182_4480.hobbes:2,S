You need to read further down in section 3:
    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it.
If the code was originally written in assembler, than the assembler
source (with comments and meaningful variable names) is the "preferred 
form".  If written in C and compiled to assembler, it isn't.
IANAL, but the wording of the GPL is fairly clear.  Obfuscated and
semi-compiled source doesn't cut it.
