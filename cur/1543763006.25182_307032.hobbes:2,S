Well, there lies a problem - some devices have to do execve because
they need firmware to operate. Also, again, some buses with
hot-pluggable devices will attempt to clean up unsuccessful resume and
this will cause hotplug events. The point is you either resume system
or you don't. We probably need a separate "unfreeze" callback,
although this is kind of messy.
