Well, my earlier find_first_bit() implementation was completely bogus.
My sanity has now returned and I coded this patch below that fixes 
find_find_bit() to return "size" if all bits are zero. I have tested it 
extensively in userspace and it boots 2.5.44-mm5 which crashed with the earlier
version of the bitops_fix patch. I have coded the assembly routine
as optimal as I could think of and without introducing any new
branches or memory loads.
Along with this patch, I applied the larger_cpu_mask patch to -mm5
and sanity tested both UP and SMP kernels for dcache leaks in a 4CPU P3 box.
An ls -lR and subsequent unmounting of that filesystems showed that
the dentries were correctly getting returned the dcache slab and
that indicates that the larger_cpu_mask patch no longer breaks RCU.
I will do some more testing with this combination later with
rcu_stats applied on this tree (just to be sure), but so far it looks good.
Thanks
