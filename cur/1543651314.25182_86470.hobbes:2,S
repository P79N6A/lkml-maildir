Something I have been thinking about for a while is a quick-config option 
(that sets some defaults that hold for 90% of the systems), or an expert mode 
that shows extra options. Though I understand that this is hard to do, and 
much hardware differs, I think it can be done for some basics like keyboard, 
mouse, USB and stuff.
Yes, this will cause your kernel to be bigger than optimal, for some drivers 
will be compiled in that are not used on your system. But if you want you can 
optimize things away after clicking <set defaults for standard IBM PC>.
If this idea is not blown away immediately, I'm willing to work this idea out 
a little, though I can understand that people call me an idiot...
