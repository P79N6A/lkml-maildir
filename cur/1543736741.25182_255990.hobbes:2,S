Right you are - unlike most times where one is trying to concatenate
strings, this time you want the nul char separator.

Perhaps - but perhaps also I've shown you ways to use a function with
fewer non-const variables.
And perhaps the placing of the nul chars should be explicit:
	if (length < buffer_size)
		buffer[length++] = '\0';
so that someone else doesn't either miss the intentional inclusion of
the nul as I just did, or does see it and thinks it's an off-by-one
error and "fixes" it.
That macro was ugly.
Adding to my previous rules of:
  * minimum number variables
  * simplest invariants on variables
  * functions beat macros
now include:
  * explicit coding of anything out of the ordinary.
