OK, So if this is done by the user space then I think we can play more 
with it? I guess that we could do a type of hdparm -F or hdparm -S to 
spin down the drive or maybe there is a way to add feature to hdparm to 
park the drive itself.
Aside from what we should do when we get the data... How can we/us/I 
start checking and see if we can find any response from the embedded 
controller?
Do we have to backengineer everything, can we get anything of this from 
IBM-ACPI, or our only way to go here is see if IBM will do anything?
Thanks for all the answers. I really don't want to drop the topic, so 
that we can figure this one out.
