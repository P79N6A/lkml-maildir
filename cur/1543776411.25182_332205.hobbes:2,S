Ok. Could you try to debug this some more? In the -51-17 patch i've 
implemented a new stack-overflow debugging feature: 'stack footprint 
maximum searching'. It is automatically active if you have 
CONFIG_LATENCY_TRACE and CONFIG_DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW enabled. It will 
track and (if it can be done safely) print out maximum stack usage sites 
immediately. Hopefully this results in better stackdumps. It should 
print similar traces:

i've written a separate, hopefully more robust stack-dumper which is 
used for the above traces. Perhaps in your overflow case it results in 
something usable.
