No no no no no.  Repeat after me ten times.  Empty or non-existant release
functions are bad and cause oopsen.  I will not create code which does
this.

What this means is that mmc_host itself becomes a refcounted sysfs
object which needs to follow the lifetime rules associated therewith.
Luckily, I thought about this earlier on, so there's a core mmc function
to allocate the beast, register it, unregister it, and finally free it.
The allocation function should initialise class_dev as much as possible.
The registration function should add the class device with the class
model.  The unregistration should remove the class device from the class
model, but _not_ free it.  The free function should drop the last
reference to the class device, which results in the remove function
(eventually) being called.  Finally, the remove function can free the
mmc_host.
Also note that since we have a class_dev, the mmc_host 'dev' field can
be removed.  However, we'll probably have to update the host drivers
to do this, so it should be a separate patch.
