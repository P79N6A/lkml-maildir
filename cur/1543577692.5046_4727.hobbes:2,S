    Umm.  No.  The object of LFS stuff is so that programs that can't
    handle large files don't shoot themselves in the foot.  You don't
    need to pass O_LARGEFILE over the protocol and knfsd doesn't need
    to handle it.  But with out specifying O_LARGEFILE you should be
    limited to 2GB on 32bit systems.
THis means we limit all NFS file sizes to 32-bits unless we have
NFSv3? (I assume v3 is where the 64-bit file sizes comes from? or
does it predate that?)
