Okay I'm still having trouble from reading back these e-mails on what
is broken and what isn't..
The most important question is if mainline 2.6.13-rc3 or -rc4 is okay?
If so then it is the -mm only that breaks  it, if -mm only can you 
modprobe drm debug=1
modprobe radeon
then start X and send me the log... try commenting out the in
radeon_drv.c line 79,
.presetup = radeon_presetup
to see if it makes it okay...
I've just booted 32-bit debian-stable and it works okay for me ..
Dave.
