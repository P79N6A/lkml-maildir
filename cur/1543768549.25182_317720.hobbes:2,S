This probably isn't what you are looking for, but I posted this a while
back, and have found this useful for myself.  
I wrote a simple perl script (attached) to turn off all the modules that
are not being used on the current system. Obviously if you have a USB
device that's not attached, it would get turned off too. But this was
nice to see what modules I actually needed to get a system running.
You first compile the kernel with the default distribution .config.
Then run this script in the directory of the kernel that's running, and
has that .config available. The output of a .config with all non
necessary modules turned off is sent to standard output.
