If regulators come down on someone, it seems like common sense
that they would be more lenient on mobile stations complying with a
misconfigured AP than they would be with a mobile station ignoring a
properly configured AP?  I know expecting common sense from government
regulators is optimistic, but still... :-)
Of course when we are the AP, the ability to adjust these parameters
could be very important.  No?
