    I have not been able to reproduce this on a single processor machine

    Basically, all the test does is:
    gettimeofday(&tv1, NULL);
    while(!done) {
    	gettimeofday(&tv2, NULL);
    	FAIL if tv2 < tv1
    	tv1 = tv2;
    }
    Any ideas on what could be causing this?
The TSC's aren't synchronized between CPUs.
This is becoming more and more of a problem and in-escapable on some
hardware so I'm starting to wonder if assuming the TSCs are even
roughly synchronized *anywhere* is a good idea.
