That part of code is walking down the sysfs tree from the s_root of
sysfs hierarchy and on each step parent is held using dget() while being
referenced, so I don't think they can turn negative there.

Can you elaborate a bit?  The locking in sysfs is unconventional but
that's mostly from necessity.  It has dual interface - vfs and driver
model && vfs data structures (dentry and inode) are too big to always
keep around, so it basically becomes a small distributed file system
where the backing data can change asynchronously.

Yes, please.
Thanks.
