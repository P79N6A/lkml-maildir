Debian developer Frederik Schueler noted that as far as he knows the laptop does
not support DMA. 
It seems that in drivers/ide/setup-pci.c, DMA is being forced on:
177 static unsigned long ide_get_or_set_dma_base (ide_hwif_t *hwif)
...
225         switch(dev->device) {
...
22x             case PCI_DEVICE_ID_CMD_643:
...
234                 if (simplex_stat & 0x80) {
235                     printk(KERN_INFO "%s: simplex device: "
236                         "DMA forced\n",
...
240             default:
241                 /*
242                  * If the device claims "simplex" DMA,
243                  * this means only one of the two interfaces
244                  * can be trusted with DMA at any point in time.
245                  * So we should enable DMA only on one of the
246                  * two interfaces.
247                  */
...
259                         printk(KERN_INFO "%s: simplex device: "
260                             "DMA disabled\n",
...
I would guess it would be enough to remove the PCI_DEVICE_ID_CMD_643 and let it
be handled by the default case, thus disabling DMA. I will try the attached
patch on my friends laptop as soon as he brings it along.
With friendly regards,
Takis
