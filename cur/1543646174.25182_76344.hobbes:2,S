Bugzilla is not a place for "fray". If you want to get flamed,
I can oblige without screwing Bugzilla.
Also, if you are a provider of a binary-only crapware which wants
to override syscalls, there's one very important document for
you to see: it's called Fig.1.
GPLed code has no problem linking with sys_call_table.
