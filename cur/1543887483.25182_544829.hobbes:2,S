Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Guilt v0.25
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Guilt v0.25 is available for download (once it mirrors out on kernel.org).
Guilt (Git Quilt) is a series of bash scripts which add a Mercurial
queues-like functionality and interface to git.
Tarballs:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jsipek/guilt/
Git repo:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jsipek/guilt.git
Really the only major changes are the new commands: import and rebase.
guilt-import allows one to import a patch into the Guilt series easily
guilt-rebase is very similar to git-rebase - it detects patches that were
pushed upstream. NOTE: This command is still not perfect, so use it with
caution.
As always, patches, and other feedback is welcome.
Josef "Jeff" Sipek.
