kmalloc() should always return NULL if the allocation failed.

If you need to allocate memory from interrupt context you should be using 
GFP_ATOMIC (or, if possible, do the allocation earlier in a different 
context).

I have no explanation for that, are you sure that's really what's 
happening?
> Is it not necessary to check for NULL before calling kfree() ??
No, it is not nessesary to check for NULL before calling kfree() since 
kfree() does    
void kfree (const void *objp)
{
	... 
        if (!objp)
                return;
	...
}
So, if you pass kfree() a NULL pointer it deals with it itself, you don't 
need to check that explicitly before calling kfree() - that's redundant.
