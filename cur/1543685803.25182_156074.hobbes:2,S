Just my (unsuccessful) attempt at humor! I think SCHED_SOFTRR is great,
although probably fills a quite small niche between SCHED_OTHER and
the realtime scheduling while being a possibility for security problems
(don't know, maybe that that is sorted?). But...
Some of the people saying playback needs to be realtime are right for
absolutely 100%, but seem to have forgotten that their pentium 100 did
just fine, and that a skip now and again probably doesn't signal the
end of the world.
I think its fairly obvious that it indicates there are problems with
the general purpose scheduler. Thankfully it is getting addressed,
which makes this just a rant ;)
