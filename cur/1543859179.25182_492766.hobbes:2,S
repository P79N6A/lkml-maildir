Why do you talk about buffers being reattached? Are you still in some 
world where "try_to_free_buffers()" matters? Have you not followed the 
discussion? Why do you ignore my MUCH SIMPLER patch that just removed all 
this crap ENTIRELY from "try_to_free_buffers()", and the exact same 
corruption happened?
Forget about "try_to_free_buffers()". Please apply this patch to your tree 
first. That gets rid of _one_ copy of totally insane code that did all the 
wrong things.
Only after you have applied this patch should you look at the code again. 
Realizing that the corruption still happens.
So forget about buffers already. That piece of code was crap.
