	Finally it was a hardware problem, both fans that cooled the hard
disks died at the same time, so the HDs were getting really hot, and it
seems that 2.4.7 doesn't play with the HD with the swap partition on it so
hard as 2.4.9 (the only way I could explain why 2.4.7 didn't crash and
2.4.9 crashed almost after boot). Sorry to bother you with hardware
problems, but two fans at the same time ... that's bad luck!
