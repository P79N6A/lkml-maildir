There are two stages for kexec. For "normal" kexec, first the
sys_kexe_load is called to load the kernel image, then
sys_reboot(LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_KEXEC) is called to boot the new kernel. The
call chain is as follow:
sys_reboot(LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_KEXEC)
    kernel_kexec
        kernel_restart_prepare
            device_shutdown
        machine_shutdown
        machine_kexec
In device_shutdown, the dev->bus->shutdown or dev->driver->shutdown of
every device is called to put device in quiescent state. In
machine_kexec, the new kernel is booted.
So, for normal kexec, there is no code path for device state saving and
restoring. State of device can be restore after shutdown? I don't think
so.

Yes, and I am very glad to collaborate with everybody who is interested
in this subject. But I think we should try to verify our idea with code
as early as possible. Now, I am trying to implement a prototype of
kexec/kdump based image writing/reading mechanism to verify the
feasibility. (I suppose you are working on separating device suspend and
device hibernate).
What do you think about the pattern of collaboration?
At last, thank you very much for your valuable reminding in the mail of
"hibernation considerations".
Best Regards,
