You're right, that's not entirely obvious from my post.  I'm using the
ncr53c8xx driver, configured as follows:
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX=y
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_DEFAULT_TAGS=8
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_MAX_TAGS=32
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_SYNC=40
As I said, I've run several late-model 2.1 kernels (-pre4-ac2,
-pre6-ac1, -pre8 and now -final), and have only had problems with the
last two, and of course pre8 jumped the driver from 3.1d to 3.1f.
I'm going to let it go one more day, and if it tanks tomorrow morning,
I'll retrofit 3.1d and see if that makes a difference.
Mike.
