BTW, a good introduction to SMP, related concepts (e.g. caches), and
alternatives (NUMA, clusters, etc.) is "In Search of Clusters" by
Gregory F. Pfister. It's also fun to read.
For a detailed analysis of the kind of SMP Linux currently assumes,
you may want to try "UNIX Systems for Modern Architectures" by Curt
Schimmel.
