I read it, but that's the way a kernel works: if you want to talk to a device, 
get a driver. You can write a rather minimal one that does only 
pci_enable_device() on probe and pci_disable_device() on remove. Try the one 
posted by Chris Wright in "[PATCH 2/2] PCI: pci-stub module to reserve pci 
device" as a starting point.
