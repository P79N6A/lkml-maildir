aha, and i thought freenet6's tunnel server has problems again.
reproduceable here with 2.6.8(.1), 2.6.7 was working indeed.
ipv6 module is loaded, the tspc client does not give much information of
what it is doing. maybe strace help here:
socket(PF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_IP) = 4
connect(4, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(53),
sin_addr=inet_addr("127.0.0.1")}, 28) = 0
send(4, "\363\t\1\0\0\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\5tsps2\10freenet6\3net\0"..., 36, 0)
= 36
gettimeofday({1093126256, 233665}, NULL) = 0
poll([{fd=4, events=POLLIN, revents=POLLIN}], 1, 5000) = 1
ioctl(4, FIONREAD, [128])               = 0
recvfrom(4,
"\363\t\201\200\0\1\0\1\0\1\0\2\5tsps2\10freenet6\3net\0"..., 1024, 0,
{sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(53),
sin_addr=inet_addr("127.0.0.1")}, [16]) = 128
close(4)                                = 0
socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_IP) = 4
connect(4, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(3653),
sin_addr=inet_addr("206.123.31.115")}, 16) = 0
write(4, "VERSION=1.0.1\r\n", 15)       = 15
read(4,
