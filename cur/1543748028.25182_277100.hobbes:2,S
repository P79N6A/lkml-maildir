This is not an application problem.  TCP is a reliable, connection
oriented protocol.  Users are right to expect that their TCP connections
do not get timed out by an overzealous firewall because the user did not
type anything in an SSH window for 20 minutes.
The problem here is that your firewall is too dumb or your firewall
rules too aggressive to distinguish a valid connection from a security
threat.  Please don't blame the users.
