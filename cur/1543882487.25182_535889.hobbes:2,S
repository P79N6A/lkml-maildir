Hi Con!
Well, at least on my two ThinkPads T42 and T23.
I perceive sd-0.46 as more mature as CFSv6. And if asked to include one of 
them in the kernel *right now* or *soonish*, I would probably choose  
sd-0.46 and give Ingo a bit more time. 
Or I would suggest a plugging interface. For me it seems difficult to make 
large scale testing efforts when I have to build two kernels all the 
time. So at least a boot time configuration parameter, even better a 
parameter to switch schedulers on the fly would be good. This way it 
would be way easier to compare different schedulers. 
Just like with I/O schedulers.  I switched from "anticipatory" to Ingo's 
great "cfq" before it became the new default. I think that a few weeks of 
testing will never be enough. How long did it take till cfq became the 
new default? How much testing did people, including distributors such as 
SUSE / Novell - who switched to cfq eariler - do? Would that torough 
testing have been done when it was a patch outside of mainline all the 
time and there was no easy possibility to switch I/O schedulers?
I think that on process schedulers this would not be any different and any 
quick prefer this or this one will miss needed long time test results. 
But I have no clue whether plugsched, especially with online switching, 
wouldn't be too much overhead.
Well just my subjective opinion. I didn't do any professional benchmarks. 
But actually what I care about most is my usually workloads and whether I 
can click together corner cases to bring schedulers out of the bounds I 
like them to operate it. Cause thats what relevant for me when using a 
Linux machine as a desktop ;-). I didn't do any testing on a server 
tough, my virtual server just uses bog standard Debian etch kernel and I 
see no need to change that.

I am happy, too. And Ingo is working really hard on it. I already have the 
next patch to test here. And it becomes better.

Okay, I am CCing this to kernel list, too!
But my original concern was, whether you want to have these CFSv6 related 
tests on ck-patch-ml at all? Strictly spoken its about ck-patches and 
your stuff, and not other schedulers, but well, no one adhered that much 
to its topic in the last weeks.
Ok, but now to my daily tasks. These still (should) have priority ;-).

Martin

Hi!
Well, there are still some audio glitches here and then. Even with
deepdance:/proc/sys/kernel> grep ".*" sched*gran*
sched_granularity_ns:0
sched_wakeup_granularity_ns:0
cfs-v6 has quite high context switch rates when driven with this 
configuration. This is context switch rates while Kaffeine plays music 
and a kernel compiles:

Maybe on desktop a schedular needs such high rates to provide excellent 
desktop responsiveness?
Ingo, I send you strace and vmstat stuff in a seperate mail. Ok, enough of 
it, we can continue this in private mail and I test your new cfs-v7-rc ,)
Back to my original question:
What nice value would do you recommend for X in sd-0.46? Really -10? I 
didn't renice at all... well what have others tried? Hmmm, Mike Mattie 
used -1. Maybe  I should try -5 or so? Well maybe I just try some values. 
I just would like to hear whether there an official recommendation? Like 
the -10 that cfs-v6 sets as default if X renicing is enabled.
And would it make sense to renice kernel threads as well with sd-0.46? I 
have seen these reniced to -10, but maybe thats default?
