1st the good news.  The 2.5.27-rmap-2b-dqcache patch fixed the compile
problem with CONFIG_QUOTA=y.
Then, I patched in 2.5.27-rmap-3-slaballoc from Craig's site and the
test machine got much further in the boot, but hung up here:
Starting cron daemon
/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S50inet: fork: Cannot allocate memory
Sorry, no further information was available.
