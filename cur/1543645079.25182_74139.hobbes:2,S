I'm not, I'm talking about the pure physical characteristics of the transport

Well, lets assume the simplest setup possible: select + tag msg + 10 byte 
command + disconnect + reselect + status; that's 17 bytes async.  The maximum 
bus speed async narrow is about 4Mb/s, so those 17 bytes take around 4us to 
transmit.  On a wide Ultra2 bus, the data rate is about 80Mb/s so it takes 
50us to transmit 4k or 800us to transmit 64k.  However, the major killer in 
this model is going to be disconnection delay at around 200us (dwarfing 
arbitration delay, bus settle time etc).  For 4k packets you spend about 3 
times longer arbitrating for the bus than you do transmitting data.  For 64k 
packets it's 25% of your data transmit time in arbitration.  Your theoretical 
throughput for 4k packets is thus 20Mb/s.  In my book that's a significant 
loss on an 80Mb/s bus.
On Fabric busses, you move to the network model and collision probabilities 
which increase as the packet size goes down.

read ahead is basically a very simplistic form of I/O scheduling.

They already do in 2.5, see scsi_populate_tag_msg() in scsi.h.  This assumes 
you're using the generic tag queueing, which the aic7xxx doesn't, but you 
could easily key the tag type off REQ_BARRIER.

The speculation is based on the observation that for transactions consisting 
of multiple writes and small reads, the reads take a long time to complete.  
That translates to starving a read in favour of a bunch of contiguous writes.  
I'm sure we've all seen SCSI drives indulge in this type of unfair behaviour 
(it does make sense to keep servicing writes if they're direct follow on's 
from the previously serviced ones).
