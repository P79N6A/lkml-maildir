Thanks to all that have made suggestions. Finnaly we found that 
#define MIN_TIMESLICE 5
#define DEF_TIMESLICE 25
works much better for us. Maybe it is an effect of that we have HZ=100 ?

Subject: Very long startup time for a new thread
(This is on a 200 MIPS embedded architecture).
On a heavily loaded system (loadavg ~4) I create a new pthread. In this
situation it takes ~4 seconds (!) before the thread is first scheduled
in (yes, I have debug outputs in the scheduler to check that). In a 2.4
based system I don't see the same thing. I don't have any RT or FIFO
tasks. Any ideas why it takes so long time and what I can do about it?
Appreciate any help
/Mikael
