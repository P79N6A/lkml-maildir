Do you know whether the nforce2's with apic support the timer (IRQ 0) in 
IO-APIC mode?  To me, it seems like a bug:
"Dec  4 20:13:11 tesore kernel: ..MP-BIOS bug: 8254 timer not connected to 
IO-APIC"
(This message originates in arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c)
nmi_watchdog doesn't seem to work at all because of this.  If it was working, 
then maybe I can catch the lockup, because if it's like you say, it's probably 
the kernel not hardware.
