I think there could be a flipside based on what Roman said, but it is
my guess only.
currently wherever msleep is used now it sleeps with an ambiguous amount.
Eventhough the ambiguous sleep period is not appreciable, fixing
msleep might have a bad side effect. ie, drivers which would be
sleeping for a specified period would sleep less, just as compared to
the more precise sleep.
I think, it would be hard to fix, such breakages. Maybe a newer sleep
method would be much better, such that it doesn't cause any breakage.
