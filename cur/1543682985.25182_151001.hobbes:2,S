The system does take the chip into account, as far as I remember. It's one of 
the first few options of the config system.
As to the -O4 option, it's important to think about what optimizations it's 
doing. Many of the critical functions in the kernel are hand coded assembler, 
no small amount of work. The other functions might gain from this, but I bet 
they don't. They might even lose from it.
In any case it appears that if you modify the HOSTCFLAGS in the top level 
Makefile, you can add these options. Do be careful. The data you save may be 
your own.
