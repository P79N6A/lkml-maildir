My experience has all been with RedHat distributions, 4.1, 5.1, 5.2
and now 6.0, so this may not be relevant, but in my experience, nfs
mounts need to have the following options specified:
	rsize=8192,soft,wsize=8192
The 2.0 kernels could manage with just those options, but the 2.1 and
2.2 kernels need either 'ro' or 'nolock' in addition to the above, and
for some reason, specifying rsize=8192 without wsize=8192 made the
mount unstable, even if it was mounted RO !!!
I also seem to remember a thread here on linux-kernel about six months
back on this subject, where it was stated that the size options needed
to be set to at least 8192 for some reason. However, I can't remember
what the reason was.
Comments, anybody?
Best wishes from Riley.
