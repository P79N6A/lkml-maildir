But Kconfigs and defconfigs belong to the sources, don't they?
Suppose you have a main source tree and multiple objdirs with a
purpose to test different .configs. Now if you update the main
tree (including it's Kconfigs), objdirs are broken. The copies
of Kconfigs are obsoleted and maybe unrelated at all. Also makefiles.
