We'll see.
It used to be a bad idea because everything was inline, but these
days with out of line code one can be much more flexible.

They are far less than 48 cycles. The P4 is not _that_ bad in this
area.

There are millions and millions of P4s out there running 
Linux and I don't think that will change any time soon (in fact Intel will
be still shipping many new ones for a long time) If there are cheap 
valuable optimizations for P4 that don't impact others much I'm all for them.
