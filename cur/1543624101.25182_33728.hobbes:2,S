Does the IDE blacklist include those drives that malfunction if they're not
using the correct connector on the IDE ribbon cable?
I found out a few weeks ago that my Caviar WD36400 is  that particular.
Upon putting that drive back on the middle connector on secondary, my box
was then able to suspend and resume without the drive disconnecting on me.
