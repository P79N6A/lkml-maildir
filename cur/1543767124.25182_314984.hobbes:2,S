Hello,
When configuring Kernel 2.6.11.7, I found under Input Devices two
options which seem to have to do with serial mouse support:
1. Serial line discipline (module serport)
2. Serial Mouse support (module sermouse)
Ic compiled both these features as a module. But after rebooting with
the new kernel, the serial mouse is working well with gpm and with X11,
although none of the above modules are loaded.
So, what for are the modules mentioned above needed?
Kind regards
  Christoph
