Btw, I suspect I was wrong on the use of basename.
Yeah, you can do it carefully with that $(patsubst %.mod,%,..) thing, but 
boy is that ugly and hard to read. Since the whole point was to hopefully 
be safer, being "ugly and hard to read" is not exactly good, and I suspect 
the original $(basename ..) was simply better.
