Which is odd, because that's exactly my combination (ASUS A7V133 + 
Athlon), and I get crashes with DMA on anything from 2.4.3-ac7 onwards, 
but up to 2.4.3-ac6 is rock-steady. (my crash test is "bonnie -s 1024" 
:-)) I wonder what's different between our machines (apart from distro, 
which I wouldn't expect to be relevant)? Clock speed? We tried 
downclocking my Athlon to 1.0 GHz but it made no difference.
I've been tinkering (have no kernel programming experience) with 
selectively forward-porting the 2.4.3-ac6 code to newer kernels for my 
own use at least, but haven't got it right yet.
