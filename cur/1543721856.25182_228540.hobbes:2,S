If you're using -ck1 it may even be the autoswappiness. Try disabling that and 
setting a static value for swappiness. If it still exhibits the problem then 
it's probably a bug somewhere in staircase. While the overall design is 
finished (it doesn't really lend itself to tuning), surely there are bugs I 
haven't sorted out even though there are no serious bugs or stability issues 
that have come up. I'm auditing the code as we speak.
Thanks.
