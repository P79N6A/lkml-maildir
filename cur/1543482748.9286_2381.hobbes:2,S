Someone reported the other day seeing a lot of interrupts's/sec when
playing sound. 
With 2.2.0-final installed, my system seems much busier than it I would
think when playing MP3's using x11amp (against the OSS AWE drivers). 
I would like to check the interrupts per second, how can I do this? Is
it something in /proc? Or a tool I can get?
