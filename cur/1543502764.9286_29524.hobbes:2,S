Subject: rewind (or fseek) on /proc files fails -- sometimes?

Dear kernel persons:
I've been working for a while on (yet another) proc-distributing
daemon called procstatd (available in alpha at
  
http://www.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/procstatd.tar.gz
if anybody wants to play with it or the associated tkperl GUI for system
monitoring).  In the daemon I open various files in /proc, e.g.
/proc/stat or /proc/loadavg and parse their contents into fields to
serve to any who request them.  Every epoch (say, 10 seconds) I then
use rewind() on read all of the open file descriptors (to avoid the
overhead of a file close/open) and reread/reparse them and deliver
either raw values or digested rates.  None of which has to do with my
question.
My question is:
  Why do some of the files in proc correctly rewind (or fseek() to the
beginning) while others, particularly /proc/loadavg, don't?  To be
explicit, on most of the files I parse, a fragment like:
 /* PROC_NET_DEV */
 errno = 0;
 if(stat_fd[PROC_NET_DEV]){
   rewind(stat_fd[PROC_NET_DEV]); /* void, so tough to check errors */
 } else {
   return;
 }
 if(errno == EBADF){
   fprintf(stderr,"Error: The /proc/net/dev file descriptor/stream is not seekable.\n");
   fclose(stat_fd[PROC_NET_DEV]); 
   fprintf(stderr,"Closing and reopening /proc/net/dev.\n");
   stat_fd[PROC_NET_DEV] = fopen("/proc/net/dev","r");
 }
works fine; the error branch is never taken and the rewound file
correctly yields a current snapshot of the dynamic network data.  On the
other hand, I have to use:
 errno = 0;
 if(stat_fd[PROC_LOADAVG]){
   /* 
    * For no good reason that I can see, a one line /proc file won't rewind
    * correctly.  So we close and reopen it.
    */
   fclose(stat_fd[PROC_LOADAVG]); 
   stat_fd[PROC_LOADAVG] = fopen("/proc/loadavg","r");
 } else {
   return;
 }
to get current data from /proc/loadavg.  If I use rewind as above I
reread the same data (from the time I originally opened and read the
file) over and over again, with NO error message on either rewind or the
fseek equivalent.
Is this an artifact of the file having only a single line?
Is this a bug in the kernel (something different about the way this
particular /proc file is built)?
Is this a "feature/bug" of rewind and fseek; that they just don't work
if one reads only a one line file?
Some of these questions I can probably answer myself with some obvious
tests (like adding a header line to /proc/loadavg, seeing what rewind
does for an arbitrary one line file) but in case somebody on the list
knows the answer (or it appears to be a real bug that needs attention) I
thought I'd post first.
