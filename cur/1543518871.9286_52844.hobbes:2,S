Nup, 1 DIMM for me... Again.. I (again IMHO) _doubt_ that it has anything to do with bad memory, I would simple expect an application to segfault, not the whole kernel to lock up.
Thanks for trying to help :)

It complaints about "Ther kernel is not able to handle null pointer at virtual address..."  Sometimes, even MagicSysrq fails to save my day with this error.  However, if I boot with 64MB RAM (linux mem=64M) the system works perfectly.  First I thought it might have been some bad RAM, but somehow I doubt that would lock up the whole system, it just seems unlikely, especially with thought to how Linux is designed.
