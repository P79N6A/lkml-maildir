I'm unclear on the specific flags in specific OSs but I can say for
certain that such things do exist in several research OSs (and I think
in a few production OSs MVS, Solaris and DU? -- I could be off on
these).  In regards to the research end of things check out these
projects:

 (The stuff with Randy 
                                                 Appleton)
and after all that I can at least tout a little of my research.

and

The summary of my recent work (HotOS VII) showed that just by tracking
what was opened after the last access to each file, we can correctly tell
you 72% of the time which file will be opened next.  I'm currently
implementing this in Linux and at the last Usenix presented a wips
that showed preliminary results (reducing read times by 2/3).
