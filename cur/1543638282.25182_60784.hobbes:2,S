Not suggesting this isn't too obsolete to care about, but...
I really don't think that would be right. Look at this crud
as an alternate partition table format that just happens
to contain something which looks like a PC partition table.
Support would best involve:
1. fdisk modified to read/write the crud
2. the kernel reading the crud
By #2 I don't mean doing an offset for the whole disk.
You have a partition table that occupies 64 (?) sectors,
containing values stored with offsets added to them.
BTW, you are dropping support for typical Pentium boxes.
If this is OK, then the f00f check can go, etc.
