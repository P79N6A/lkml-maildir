Sorry for chiming in this late in the discussion, but...  Shouldn't it
be more correct to not depend on the ip address of the used network,
but to use the "scope" parameter of the given address?
Example
# ip ad sh
...
N: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,10000> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 1000
    link/ether ...
    inet 169.254.3.3/16 brd 169.254.255.255 scope link eth0
    inet ... scope global eth0
The only drawback is that the scope is usually set manually, and maybe
some tools don't handle it right now, since it's available since just a
few years :)  Scopes, when set right, also may do some appropriate
magic, as I understand, like selecting the correct the source address,
and not allowing link-local addresses to reach out to other scopes.
(Which is also mentioned in the RFC, but this strictness prevent
transparent NAT of clients to the internet.)
I did not look however, whether the scope is available on the place the
patch is modifying currently.  Does the idea look sane to anyone else?
