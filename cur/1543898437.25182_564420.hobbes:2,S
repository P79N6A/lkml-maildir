Hi Nam,
Yes this is a bug.  Thanks for the great test module.
The problem is in idr_get_new_above_int() in the loop which
adds new layers to the top of the radix tree.  It is failing
the "layers < (MAX_LEVEL - 1)" test.  It doesn't allocate the
new layer but still calls sub_alloc() which relies on having
the new layer properly constructed.  I believe that it is
allocating the slot which corresponds to id = 0.
I believe this is an off by one error in calculating the
MAX_LEVEL value.  I will do a more careful review and post 
a fix in the next day or so.  I have been in Ottawa for OLS.
I'm flying home tomorrow.
