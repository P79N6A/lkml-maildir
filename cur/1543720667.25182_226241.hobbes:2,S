It appears that the adapter is slow to respond to commands at this
point.  It's possible that this is related to the firmware cache flush
issue we're aware of.
Can you please follow the instructions at 
http://lists.us.dell.com/pipermail/linux-poweredge/2004-May/020104.html
which describe how to disable the read and write caches using the
afacli command and see if that solves it for you?  If so, then the
permanent solution will be a new firmware when released.
Thanks,
Matt
