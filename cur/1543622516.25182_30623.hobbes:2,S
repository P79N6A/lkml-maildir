   Just wanted to say thanks for doing this work, the driver works great
   for me for this device:
   01:04.0 Ethernet controller: BROADCOM Corporation NetXtreme BCM5700 Gigabit Ethernet (rev 12)
           Subsystem: BROADCOM Corporation NetXtreme BCM5700 1000BaseTX
 ...   
   But I'm only able to run it at 10Mbit :)
Thanks for the report, but can you also show us the "dmesg" lines
that the driver printed out when the module was loaded?  That provides
more detailed probing information for us.
