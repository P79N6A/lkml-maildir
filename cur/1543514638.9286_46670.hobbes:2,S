     Just another data point...
     I've taken all the hardware out of the SS-10BSX, the SCSI controller
(don't know the part number off hand but it's the Sun S-bus card with a 10mb/s
SCSI controller and 10-base-T ethernet), the CGSIX video board, and put it back
in a 4/670MP that I had retired but hadn't yet gotten rid of. 
     Hooked up all the same drives, controller 0 has two Barracuda 4gb drives
and two Quantum 4gb drives, controller 1 was a Western Digital Enterprise 9gb
drive and two Seatgate Elite-9 9gb drives to the 4/670MP, with the same drives
on the S-bus card, using the same SCSI cables.
     With Linux 2.2.13 SMP kernel, absolutely NO changes in the kernel, I did
not recompile it from when it was on SS-10, left it totally alone, with this
same kernel, I do not get any of the disk errors on the 4/670MP.
     So I don't know if I just got yet another defective SS-10 mainboard or
perhaps there is something weird about those controllers that don't like the
40mhz bus (the 670 card I have has a 25mhz S-bus). 
     I'm going to try to get yet another main board if I can just to eliminate
that possibility.
     I've got another SS-10 with 2.2.13 on it, and under normal operation I
don't see errors, but with heavy disk I/O, like while writing backup tapes,
sometimes I do, and that is just on the built-in controller.
