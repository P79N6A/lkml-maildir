Sure,
I know two industries that do such a thing (almost);
Spacecraft and the Telephone Company (any/all);
I did say almost...
I'll speak of the telephone industry, because I am more familar with it...
There they use two (or more) machines, running near the same program...
The one connected to the outside world of hardware is duplicating the 
event in a message, sent to the second...
The second, instead of listening to the outside world is listening to the
messages, duplicating all of the program logic except the hardware i/o.
The memory data structures are identical between the two.
When disaster happens...
Machine two rolls out it's listening modules, rolls in the i/o modules,
sends signal to hardware buss switch to give it the system buss.
Then the fun begins... 
Recover the hardware (or at least the billing information).
Note the three points above:
1) Near identical programs
2) Identical data structures
3) Two sets of CPU hardware
Switching from linux-2.4.x to linux-2.6.x doesn't qualify;
The person who asked this question wants to do it on
a single machine - The price just went way up...
Linux uses internal data structures when and wherever
they are needed.  Updating them all to be consistant 
would be a real b....
Probably you would have to start from scratch and
rebuild them...
Hmm, I think I just said "reboot" the machine with 
the new kernel.
