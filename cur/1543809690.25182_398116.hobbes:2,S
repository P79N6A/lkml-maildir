I haven't tried to track this down yet, but with recent 2.6.16-git, it
seems that the suspend console is gone... That is, the kernel still
switches VTs from X to some console with no getty on it, but no kernel
message gets displayed at all during the suspend process... looks like
this kmsg_redirect thing isn't working.
Known problem ?
Ben.
