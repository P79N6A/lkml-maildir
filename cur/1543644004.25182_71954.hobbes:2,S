Actually you can do it in hardware on the 16550 depending how its wired.
Take a look at the usenet-2 serial port design some day. The software
mode we do does in theory mean heavy delay to the bh handling might
delay the assertion excessively. That I think may be the real
explanation here.
Its
         buffer full
         bh handler delayed by bh load (tasklet nowdays I guess I mean)
         overrun
         overrun
         ...
         ksoftirqd
         Oh look I should do carrier
Russell - does that sound reasonable.
If so the answer yet again (as with the gige performance and some
others) might be to make it much much harder for stuff tofall back to
ksoftirqd.
