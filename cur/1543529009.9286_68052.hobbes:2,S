Old bug that became worse. Fix:

+++ fs/namei.c.new Tue Mar  7 23:15:20 2000

        mode &= ~current->fs->umask;
-       if (!S_ISFIFO(mode) && !capable(CAP_MKNOD))
+       if ((S_ISCHR(mode)||S_ISBLK(mode)) && !capable(CAP_MKNOD))
                goto exit_lock;
        error = may_create(dir, dentry);
Details: the check used to be in sys_mknod(). It was bogus, since it
covered sockets in addition to devices (for which it was intended).
However, since normally mknod(2) is not used that way (it's legitimate
use, but very rare; mknod(1) doesn't provide a way to do that) it was not
noticed until it was moved. Then it became really visible since it began
to affect all do_mknod() callers, including unix_bind(). Already submitted
to Linus.
