mutex_unlock() must be called by the process which did the mutex_lock(). 
Doing the mutex_unlock() from an interrupt will cause warnings when run
with debugging enabled.  You should run with debugging enabled when doing
any development.  
Also, mutex_unlock() takes a mutex-internal spinlock in a non-irq-safe
fashion - if the timing is right, your mutex_unlock() in IRQ context will
deadlock.
