Subject: [PATCH] Inhibit NMI watchdog when Alt-SysRq-T operation is underway.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

On large memory configuration with not so fast CPUs the NMI watchdog 
is triggered when memory addresses are being gathered and printed. 
The code paths for Alt-SysRq-t are sprinkled with touch_nmi_watchdog 
in various places but not in this routine (or in the loop that utilizes
this function). The patch has been tested for regression on large CPU+memory 
configuration (128 logical CPUs + 224 GB) and 1,2,4,16-CPU sockets with various 
memory sizes (1,2,4,6,20).
