	   Err, no, /proc/devices isn't a filesystem, it's a FILE.  The idea
   being it's a list of major,minor's that are in the system, or perhaps
   something like:
   +8,0
   +8,1
   +8,2
   +8,4
   -8,1
   +8,3
	   Where a proggie can then read the file and determine what is 
   currently in the system, and by watching the file can see what devices are
   added/removed.  NOTE: This is just a random thought on the layout, it prolly
   has lots of problems so don't think I'm suggesting it as a permanent
   solution.
We'd want to put more information in /proc/devices than just the file.
Having the name of the device is also useful, since in some cases the
device driver may not have a permanently assigned major number, and so
it gets a dynamically assigned one.  There may be other information
which may be helpful to the driver as well.  I would suggest a format
like this:
driver=scsidisk major=8 minor=9 scsiid=0 lun=0 ...
Other devices drivers may feed other information to the user-space
daemon, such as USB topology information.  So it's best if the format is
kept extensible.
