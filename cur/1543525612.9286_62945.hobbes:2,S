Subject: [PATCH] Fix poll bug

Hi Alan,
I just found a poll() bug. poll currently returns -EINTR when
a signal occurs, which causes the system call to be restarted. Unfortunately
the timeout is not decreased, so when you have a periodic SA_RESTART timer
with just the right period and no other event occurs poll hangs forever.
select does it correctly, it always returns EINTR and is never restarted.
I found it because syslogd's 30s "mark" timer can trigger it in the
dns resolver when syslogd does forwarding. 
This patch fixes the problem. I also fixed an outdated comment.
Please add for 2.2.15. Thanks.
