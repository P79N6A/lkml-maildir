Subject: 2.3.47 build barfing on mtrr.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

I saw this come across yesterday, but no resolution. I've been having
problems building the latest dev kernel. I'm running the frozen debian
potato release, and the build seems to have a problem with mtrr.c. Looks
like it may be a problem with improperly nested #if tags:
make -C  arch/i386/kernel
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/kernel'

make[1]: *** [mtrr.o] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/kernel'
make: *** [_dir_arch/i386/kernel] Error 2
I've also included my kernel config. Please let me know if you have
solutions -- I'll be happy to help test them. Also, please let me know if
you need other info about my config. The kernel builds fine if I turn off
MTRR support.
