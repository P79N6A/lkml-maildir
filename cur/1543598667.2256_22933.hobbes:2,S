I tested the situation with 2.4.7 (straight, no patches) and it looks like this:

I can see these:
Aug 22 13:34:53 admin kernel: __alloc_pages: 2-order allocation failed.
Aug 22 13:34:53 admin kernel: __alloc_pages: 3-order allocation failed.
Aug 22 13:34:53 admin last message repeated 21 times
_BUT_ I cannot see any errors during NFS-filecopy. I tried hard, but no errors. Another thing is the CPU load. It is definitely lower than with 2.4.9 around 3 - 3.5, but never 4 or above.
Swap is not used, although turned on.
Besides the above kernel-messages I would say that 2.4.7 performs a lot better (and more stable) than 2.4.9 in this test case.
I think a deep look should be taken into this topic, because it makes 2.4.9 pretty unusable for server-environment. I wonder if anybody can produce (low-memory) errors during normal file-operation on localhost (not NFS like me). I would expect that, for it doesn't look NFS specific. I can make the kernel shoot loads of error messages only by reading CDs while copying in the background from the net. The effect can be seen vice versa, too. So you could say it is clearly a memory management problem, and not related to the allocating process.
Should I try with a plain 2.4.8 ?
