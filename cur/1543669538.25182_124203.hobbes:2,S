I have a IMO better patch than the one you have and I have tried to get
Harald to approve one of the patches, I just can't get any kind of
response from him.
The new one doesn't leave any dangling pointers around. 
This is the one I'd prefer, I just need to get it blessed.
I'd say we get this to Linus and then Harald can submit a diffrent fix
if he doesn't approve of this one since it seems it can cause crashes.
(although only if the conntrack memory was released by slab before it is
touched by the faulty code in conntrack (which hasn't been the case in
the reports I've seen since it was caught when allocating new
conntracks), shouldn't be able to cause crashes in conntrack itself)
Compiled but not booted (more than what I did with the other fix :)
