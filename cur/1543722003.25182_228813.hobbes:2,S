I (as user) am completely confused now. I though that "iocharset" was
the option to convert the (UCS) VFAT names from Unicode (on disk) to some
limited encoding represented the Unix system (eg. ISO-8859-1) and vice
versa; but it was limited to single-byte encodings, so "utf8" switch was
invented to do direct UCS<->UTF-8 conversion.

Is it possible to extend iocharset to allow UCS<->UTF-8 conversion?
Wouldn't this make the utf8 switch obsolete?

Excuse me, why do you need a special IOCHARSET setting for FAT
filesystems? Why should it be different from any other filesystems? Are
there any other filesystems except those from MS that support (widechar)
Unicode filenames on disk?

What do you man with "lower <-> upper"? The letter case? Isn't this a
task for the FAT16-names access method?

Should describe explicitely that only the short "MS-DOS" names are meant
here.

What is the "I/O charset"? The description is completely useless for a
user, it does not explain what is converted and where and why and what
happens with the data or what is this good for. In contrary, I would
think that this is the conversion method from a local encoding to equaly
limited I/O encoding.

UTF-8 is not a charset, it is an encoding. Don't mix things together.
