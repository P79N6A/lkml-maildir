 On the other hand GCC just produces an assembly text file, it is
not the GCC developper problem what the user does with this text file.
Usually it goes to the assembler with standard options - .code16gcc
is a "special" option - and bugs (if there is) should be forwarded to binutils.
 GCC tries to go around CPU bugs, and those bug may be different in
protected or real mode - but I still do not have one example of such
a bug.
 GCC also has a base library support (multiplication & divisions of
64 bits...), and when you use .code16gcc you know you cannot touch it
(it is assembled with .code32); so that management may be what they
are refering to.
 Etienne.
