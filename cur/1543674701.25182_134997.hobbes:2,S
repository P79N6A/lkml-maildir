    although I respect your maintainer's responsible and safe position, I'd like
    to state that version 6.2.28 has been in the latest pre-releases for quite some
    time, and the reason you invoked for removing it at -rc time was the lockups
    people still encounter with the version present in -rc3, perhaps to a lesser
    extent. These lockups *SEEM* to have vanished from 6.2.33 for people who
    complained previously. Moreover, the lockup I encountered on my systems was
    fixed and demonstrated by Justin to really be a locking bug, so this was not
    just a "let's see how it behaves" fix.
I think there's some misunderstanding about what a release candidate
is.  It's an attempt to see if a particular set of code is viable as the
released product.  Any bugs reported against a rc that are deemed
problems to the release need to be fixed, either by adding a simple and
easily verifiable bug fix or by reverting the problem code.
The bksend file on 
http://people.freebsd.org/~gibbs/linux/SRC/
representing the requested updates is 475k compressed.  There's no
definition of the phrase "simple and easily verifiable bug fix" I can
encompass that could be applied to a chunk of code that size.
In these circumstances, absent a simple fix for the problem, the only
choice seems to be reversion and trying to get the code base stable at
the beginning of the next -pre, which is the current decision.
