I don't use it (note the "there's no isp2x00" bit above).  But it's
still part of ia64 defconfig (which I don't maintain), and it's easier
to tell people "use generic_defconfig" than to tell them to remove
CONFIG_SCSI_QLOGIC_FC by hand.
In general, I think if a driver is in the tree, it should be fair
game for bugfixes.  In fact, I see you did the most recent one to
qlogicfc :-)
