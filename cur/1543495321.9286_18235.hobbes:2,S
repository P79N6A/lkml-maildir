In our project we are trying to generate sql statements from void structure
pointers.
Only structure name(as a string) and a void pointer(could be any of  several
structures) gets passed to the DB library function. From the former we find
the table name and then do sql describe to get column details which are same
as struct fields.
Is  there any way to get the variable type and size of fields of a structure
from binary file, symbol  table etc.?
I dont  know much  about binary file standards, any info on that will  be
great help.
Thanks in advance
Yogi
