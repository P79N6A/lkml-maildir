     As many of you know I've been trying to get ANY 2.2.x kernel to run stable
on a multi-CPU Sparc platform.  Specifically, I've got two SS-10's with quad
Ross Hypersparc 100Mhz CPU's.  One machine has 256MB of RAM and a 2nd disk
controller (just the 10mb + ethernet card that Sun sold), and the other machine
has 384MB of RAM and only the built-in disk controller.  I used to have a Sun
4/670MP which I attempted to run a 2.2.x kernel on and it exhibited the same
problem but that machine has since been retired so I can no longer test any
fixes on it. 
     The first machine is a news server and is running INN 1.7.2 (yes I know an
ancient version), the second machine a web server running Apache 1.3.3p3. 
     Both machines were stable with 2.0.35 kernel, except that during the boot
up procedure they would sometimes hang during fsck or mounting of the file
systems, but once they got past that they were always stable.
     With 2.2.x they no longer exhibit the hang during fsck or mounting of file
systems, but after some period of time crash with these spin_lock messages, the
details of which I have posted previously but I will post again below this
message. 
     I am currently running 2.2.10, because both 2.2.11 and 2.2.12 had other
severe stability problems, 2.2.11 I never succeeded in getting to run more than
two hours without a crash, and 2.2.12 the longest it's survived is about eight
hours before it totally ran the machine out of memory, including swap. 
     2.2.10, I've got Anton Blanchard, I'll quote from Anton:
"There are some races during context creation and switching on SMP
sparc32. This fixes one problem and if you have contexts > NR_TASKS then
you probably wont see the others. (There are problems when we need to
steal a context from antother cpu)".
     This patch DOES really help, it makes the difference between several hours
of uptime and several days.  On these machines, it is my understanding there
are 4096 contexts (experts - correct me if I'm wrong), and NR_TASKS is
currently set to 512. 
     And then I've got Andrea's schedualer patch, which did not noticably
reduce the occurances of the spin_lock lock-up, but did very noticably improve
the responsiveness of the machine and cut the compile times almost in half for
a kernel with make -j4. 
     And then I have a patch from David Miller that adds some nop's in the
Sparc assembly code after loading the psr at various locations.  That patch if
it made any difference it was very minor.  Given the semi-random nature of the
lock-ups it's kind of difficult to tell.
     Then tonight for shits and grins I tried to apply Mingo's low latency
patch.  Initially I wasn't able to get it to compile on Sparc, and then at his
suggestion I backed out changes to drivers/char, linux/console_struct.h,
linux/selection.h, and linux/vt_buffer.h and then it compiled fine. 
     With this patch in place the machine absolutely flies interactively!  I've
never had a Unix box respond like that, I mean instantaneous keyboard response. 
Audio and what not aside (I haven't started to play with that under Linux yet),
the patch is very nice just from a standpoint of how the machine responds. 
     But....  The spin_lock thing happens within one minute of coming up in
multi-user mode with the patch in place, which is a real bummer, but maybe it
will help chase this problem down. 
     Another clue, with this patch in place, an fsck, particularly on a file
system on a stripped partition, will lock it up within two seconds.
     There are two common ways it locks, the most common way prints the
following over and over again until I L1-A the machine, and then the weird
thing is even though I get the PROM prompt, it keeps printing these messages
out in yellow in the background and they scroll while the PROM text in black on
white, does not.  It's as if L1-A is only halting some of the CPU's and others
continue to grind in the spin_lock thing.  If I type "reset" then it stops
printing the spin_lock after it resets. 
     The common message looks like this:
spin_lock (f0156c4c) CPU #1 stuck at f002dc78, owner PC (f002dc78)
	.
	.
	.
	ad nausium
     An alternative alternates:
spin_lock (f0156c4c) CPU #1 stuck at f002dc78, owner PC (f002dc78)
spin_lock_irqsave (f015fa78) CPU #0 stuck at f0114e00, owner PC (f00d26dc):CPU
#1
     When this happens, these two messages alternate indefinitely.
     In the System.map:
     -----
     From first message:
	f0156c4c D kernel_flag
	f002dc78 falls between two symbols:
        f002dbd4 T patchme_store_new_current
		... f002dc78 ... no exact match
	f002df20 T __wake_up
     _____
     From the second message:
	f015fa34 D read_ahead
		... f015fa78 ... no exact match
	f015fe30 D blk_size
	f0114dcc t esp_intr
		... f0114e00 ... no exact match
	f0114ea0 t esp_intr_4d
	f00d2564 T add_request
		... f00d26dc ... no exact match
	f00d2918 T make_request
     I can't help but wonder if it's relavent that this one seems to involve
some signals in the esp device driver and this lock-up happens within a couple
of seconds of starting an fsck (something disk I/O intensive). 
     I've got this kernel configured really minimally, that is no drivers or
capabilities compiled in that I don't need for this machine and application.
