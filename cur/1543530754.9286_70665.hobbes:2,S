Except that the user IS exceeding what was made available via quotas.

This is why resource allocation and quotas are important in multiuser systems.

Unfortunately, that may not be the right one. The "mallocbomb" may not be
growing very fast - but the web server might be as compaired to the bomb.
Or it might be telnetd/login starting a new session. Or cron starting
a new job. Or inetd starting a new ftpd. Or init trying to restart a
getty on the console which just logged out...

It cannot be spec'ed without having something to measure against. This is
the other place resource quotas come in.
This can be compaired to disk quotas. Nobody will really fault the use
of disk quotas.
1. How many file systems are overcommited? 
2. Whose decision was that?
3. Who detects the failure?
4. Who gets the blame when it occurs?
If filesystems are not overcommited, the the total of all legal users
will equal the size of available data space (meta-data included as
"data" here). An overcommited file system is one where the total of
all users quota exceeds the size of the filesystem.
Filesystem failure doesn't occur until enough users use up the space.
No single user may have even reached their limit. But random write
failures occur, databases may become corrupt, and a lot of blame
is going to be assigned.
Ansers with quota controls:
  #2: Overcommiting is a management choice.
  #3: the first user that fills the filesystem without using up their quota
  #4: Management.
Without quotas being available:
   #2: the analyst that selected the system
   #3: the first user that fills the filesystem
   #4: the operating system
Do I use quotas? YES.
Do I have overcommit? YES - management said to do so.
Does the system or analyst get blamed for failure? NO.
I need the same controls on Linux servers that I have on other servers.
I can be a lot more lax on restrictions where the system is dedicated
to a single user than I can where it is a multiuser server.
