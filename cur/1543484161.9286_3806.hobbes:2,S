Certainly, if anyone has it.  I can't find it.

A fair criticism.  This is meant to be an introductory document to
familiarise people slightly with it - somewhere between `what's a
filesystem?' and reading the source code.

Oops, I meant to put that in.

There isn't necessarily on later revisions of ext2..

I'll think about these.

If someone wishes to submit a diff to describe the preallocation (or
any other algorithm used in ext2), feel free :-)  Little-endianness
added.

The include file says:
#define EXT2_MIN_BLOCK_SIZE             1024
#define EXT2_MAX_BLOCK_SIZE             4096
I'm perfectly willing to believe one _can_ create 8k block size filesystems,
nevertheless, the specification says one _may_ not.

Section rewritten.  thanks.

I don't think it's the primary reason it exists, but I do agree this is one
of its effects and I shall add this reason.

ACLs certainly are not out of fashion: see tsx-11's ALPHA/ext2fs directory.

but I do remember fragments being considered uninteresting.  I've tried
to be non-judgemental about features in the document though.

I think that's more suitable for the mke2fs manual page.

If you look at the other files in the Documentation/filesystems directory,
most of them only contain this information.  I think this will be the
primary information that people are after when looking in this file.
Therefore, I put it at the start.

Heh.  I was trying not to be inflammatory... ;-)
Thanks for your input.
