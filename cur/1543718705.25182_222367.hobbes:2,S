I think the switchover will happen fairly rapidly, since it is 
positioned "the upgrade you get next time you buy a new computer", 
similar to the current PATA->SATA switchover.
Since these CPUs run in 32-bit mode just fine, I bet you wind up with 
people running Intel or AMD 64-bit CPUs long they abandon their 32-bit 
OS.  I recall people often purchasing gigabit ethernet cards long before 
they had a gigabit switch, simply because it was the volume technology 
that was being at the time.  I think the same thing is going to happen 
here, with AMD64 and EM64T.
AMD got a lot of things right with this one...
