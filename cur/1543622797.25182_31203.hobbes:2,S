This dump is somewhat inconclusive. I miss the SYN packets, but I'm
especially interested in this bit:

how does this continue? I see the linux machine continuing to send data with
higher sequence numbers, but how does it end? It looks like the linux
machine never sent anything beyond 11680, relative.
To know more, dump at both ends. I really think something in between is
messing up - either a network adaptor or a ""smart"" network element.
