oh gee.
I (and others) reviewed and commented on all this code last month.  Now
here it is again and, although I'm sure it is delightful code, nobody wants
to have to read it all again ;)
The one-month gap between v3 and v4 is unfortunate.  It means that everyone
has forgotten everything.
Was all the review feedback satisfactorily handled to the reviewers'
satisfaction?
Is there any new material in here which would require a re-review?
