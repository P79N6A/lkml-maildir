Subject: [PATCH] fix segmentation fault in "make menuconfig" in current 2.4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

I just ran into the following error:
~/linux-2.4.19$ make ARCH=arm menuconfig
...
/bin/sh scripts/Menuconfig arch/arm/config.in
Using defaults found in arch/arm/defconfig
Preparing scripts: functions, parsingscripts/Menuconfig: line 1: 21468 Segmentation fault      awk "$1"
Awk died with error code 139. Giving up.
make: *** [menuconfig] Error 1
Looks like it's been reported before; Menuconfig has two mistakes
in how it handles missing files in its awk sections.
See 
http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-utils/2001-10/msg00155.html
Even 2.4.21-rc7 seems to still contain the bug (unless I squinted wrong).
Here's a patch relative to 2.4.19 that gets rid of the awk crash,
as recommended by Arnold Robbins (!):

Once that's applied, Menuconfig produces a more useful, though still bad,
error message:
-----

scripts/Menuconfig: ./MCmenu0: line 63: `fi'

Menuconfig has encountered a possible error in one of the kernel's
configuration files and is unable to continue.  Here is the error
report:
  Q> scripts/Menuconfig: MCmenu0: command not found
-----
Figuring out what's going on then requires commenting out the line in
Menuconfig that removes MCmenu0.
The root cause of the error is that the file drivers/ssi/Config.in
is in the arm-linux kernel, but not in the vger kernel.
Sigh.  So I only ran into the problem because I was trying to configure
(let alone build) the vger kernel for arm, which apparantly is something nobody ever does.
