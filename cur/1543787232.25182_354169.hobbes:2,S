Yeah, that's exactly what it does.  I see your point, but no matter
how I design this (debounce timer, no debounce timer, whatever), in
such a situation we always have either:
- plug/unplug
or
- unplug/plug
One of them will always win.
I will change this so that 'plug' wins (as in, the unplug call will be
made first, the plug second).  This way if we have both bits set, but
what we ACTUALLY wanted was an unplug:
- the unplug API interface ata_port_disables the ap in question.  It
queues up and unplug event.
- the plug API interface deletes the queued plug event, and stores up
a plug on the timer.
- the plug timer event triggers, the first thing it does is execute
ata_scsi_handle_unplug, which the unplug handler would have done
anyways.  It removes the associated struct scsi_device from existence.
 Following this, it does a reset and attempts to detect a new device;
there is none (we actually unplugged it), so it just fails, no device
detected.  So this case works.
If we have both bits set but wanted a a plug:
- the unplug API interface ata_port_disables the ap in question.  It
queues up and unplug event.
- the plug API interface deletes the queued plug event, and stores up
a plug on the timer.
- the plug timer fires off and does what we want.
Is this acceptable?  I'd love to make the hardware acknowledge only
one request and interrupt me again with another, but there is no way
to get it to do that; when you acknowledge a hotplug interrupt it
clears the register of all hotplug events whether you handled them
specifically or not.
