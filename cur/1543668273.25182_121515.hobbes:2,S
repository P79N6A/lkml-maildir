I'm confused by this for two reasons:
First, from looking at workqueue.c (especially the comment in
queue_delayed_work() that says "Increase nr_queued so that the flush
function knows that there's something pending."), it seems like
flush_scheduled_work() should wait until even delayed work is done.
Given that, I don't think the del_timer_sync() should be there --
wouldn't flush_scheduled_work() block forever, since nr_queued can
never reach 0 now?
(I guess I'm assuming the real race is that tty_io.c calls
schedule_delayed_work() between flush_scheduled_work() and
release_mem() in release_dev())
Second, I don't see how it's _ever_ safe to call
flush_scheduled_work().  The comment in workqueue.c before
flush_workqueue() says "NOTE: if work is being added to the queue
constantly by some other context then this function might block
indefinitely."  But flush_scheduled_work() is flushing the keventd_wq,
which other code will definitely add work to.  If we're unlucky,
flush_scheduled_work() could block forever.  Am I just being paranoid?
