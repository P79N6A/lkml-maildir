So what would happen if I add an essential GPL2-only file to a "GPL2
or later" project? Let's recall, a proprietary program that
combines/derives with GPL code makes the final binary GPL (and hence
the source, etc. and whatnot, don't stretch it). Question: The Linux
kernel does have GPL2 and GPL2+later combined, what does this make
the final binary?
(Maybe you implicitly answered it by this already, please indicate):

From that I'd say it remains GPL2 only.
Thanks for the clarification (though I know we're all IANALs.)
