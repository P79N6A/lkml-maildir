Is there some way to rebase these patches/git tree to be a bit more easy
to review?  Right now there are over 75 patches in the tree and many (if
not most) can be removed by merging them with previous patches.
If someone could break this stuff down into reviewable pieces, it would
go a very long way toward making it acceptable.
Is there any way to just provide a basic framework that everyone can
agree on and then add on more stuff as time goes on?  Do we have to have
every different processor/arch with support to start with?
thanks,
