With the sheer amount of sheeple[1] in the world (and on this list), I doubt 
anything could make these discussions any shorter.
(While I hate thinking that sheeple are on this list, it is an unavoidable 
fact. (I had hoped I wouldn't find any sheeple here, as my favorite theory is 
that they are all "Fundamentalist Christians" like the "Creationist" fools))
DRH
1: Sheeple (n): People that act like sheep - ie: they cannot think or form 
opinions for themselves and always look to someone else for their thoughts 
and parrot the opinions of some "trusted" figure.
