Thank you for your response, Jiri - 
On this system I am using a PS2 Keyboard - and let me stress that it is
only occasionaly that it happens - I have had 2.6.24-git15 up for about
2 hours now and have only seen it about a dozen times.
I also note one other thing - although my system is lightly loaded - at
this time of day I am pretty much just using email on an AMD 64 X2 4600+
with 2 gigs of of memory - I have noticed several times that I will be
typing away and nothing is appearing on the screen - and a few seconds
later - boom - there it all is.
There is no way an old fella like me should be able to out type a system
like this.
Chris
