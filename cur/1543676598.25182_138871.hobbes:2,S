In message <Pine.SOL.4.30.0306071815120.6449-100000@mion.elka.pw.edu.pl> you write:

And it'll leave unused warnings all over the place, meaning you have
to add __unused to all the callers.  Now gcc 3.3 will actually discard
those unused functions, this might be worth considering.
But if you're going to do that, make create_proc_entry etc *not*
return NULL if !CONFIG_PROC_FS, otherwise you need the #ifdef anyway.
This has been noted before.
Good luck!
Rusty.
