Hi,
 Please don't flame for posting in wrong list. I am not receiving any
reply to my query from binutils@srouces.redhat.com. I know people here
will surely help me out.
-- 
 I am using gcc linker on a mips architecture. 
My .text segment for vmlinux starts at 0x80040000 and ends at 0x8010ffff
64K of memory region from 0x80060000 is reserved memory, I do not want
linker to generate any address of .text in this address range. How
should I do it . I tried using MEMORY command like
MEMORY
{  
   rom (!w!x) : ORIGIN = 0x80060000, LENGTH = 64K
}
.text 0x80040000 :
{
  *(.text)
} = 0
but still ld is using address range 0x80060000 (+64K) for .text .
In a nutshell, How do I reserve a memory in one particular section
Please CC me.
Thanks 
Amol
