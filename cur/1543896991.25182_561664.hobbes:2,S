Sure, all devices have a "subsystem" link, you have to readlink()
that, and if it ends in "block, you have a blockdev. But as mentioned
in an earlier mail, you should stop scanning /sys/devices/ and always
come from the subsystem directories, so you get "block" for free.

Sure, you have! There are devices in /sys/bus which export device
nodes, and the number will just grow.
That's why the document states: "There is no such thing like class-,
bus-, physical devices, interfaces, and such that you can rely on in
userspace. Everything is just simply a "device". Class-, bus-,
physical, ... types are just kernel implementation details, which
should not be expected by applications that handle devices."

Sure, any help is welcome here.
