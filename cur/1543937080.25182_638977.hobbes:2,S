I totally agree with you. What I mean is to first do the split of
functions - into three: ordering, starvation prevention, and blockade
waiting. Then to do better ordering by adopting radix tree(or rbtree
if radix tree is not enough), and lastly get rid of the list_heads to
avoid locking. Does it sound like a good path?
