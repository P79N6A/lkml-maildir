LOL.
Although in this case it was actually not a Linux MUA:
	User-Agent: Thunderbird 2.0.0.0 (Windows/20070326)
but I didn't want to embarrass Robert publicly before you brought up the 
issue of operating systems ;)
Your procmail filter looks somewhat broken, btw. It will trigger on things 
that aren't headers, and it will potentially _not_ trigger on headers (ie 
if they are line continuations). But I guess it works well enough in 
practice.
