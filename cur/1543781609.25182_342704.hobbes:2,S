There is a good chance the rt2x00 driver will get into the kernel tree
in time, since there is no firmware to upload - Ralink Tech
(www.ralink.com.tw) took a design decision to incorporate the firmware
into an EEPROM on-board, allowing their driver to be GPL'd, and the
rt2x00 is a Linux-specific rewrite which is stabilising well.
