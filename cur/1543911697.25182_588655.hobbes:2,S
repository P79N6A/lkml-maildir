I found
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/gregkh/patches.git;a=blob;f=pci/pci-disable-decode-of-io-memory-during-bar-sizing.patch;h=958ef4e837733206a80f058aee236847eec5fbd8;hb=HEAD
which has two problems:
 - With a 64-bit BAR, it checks to see if the upper 32 bits represent IO
   or memory.  You can't do that to the upper 32 bits.
 - It does a lot of additional writes to the cmd register; my patch does two
   writes per device; yours does two per BAR
It's also a lot more complex than my patch, IMO.
Greg, please drop Robert's patch and put mine in instead.
