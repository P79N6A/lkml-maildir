As I suspected, 2.2.19pre9 + the NFS/SunRPC changes locked up under load 
with the now familiar:
wait_on_bh, CPU 2:
irq:  1 [0 0]
bh:   1 [0 1]
<[8010af71]> 
This time it happened precisely when I ran a ls -lR on a large tree over 
NFS, so I'm pretty sure this is it.
I'll do another test, 2.2.18 + the NFS/SunRPC changes, and see how it 
goes. Hopefully they'll apply easily...
Thanks,
Ion
