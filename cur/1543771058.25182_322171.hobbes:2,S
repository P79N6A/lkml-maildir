Re: ACPI sleep states and 2.6.12-rc5, VIA VP3, Cyrix MII:
    not wakeable after delay
 PM> Did it work properly in any previous kernel?
The testing sleep periods were mostly short, but, a couple of
times it wouldn't wake - i think only after longer stand-bys. i don't
recall the kernel versions. 2.6.12-rc4-mm1 and -mm2 don't wake at all.
and there's the C1 state at /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/power but no C2 .
14!cat /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/power  # 2.6.12-rc5
active state:            C2
max_cstate:              C8
bus master activity:     00000000
states:
    C1:                  type[C1] promotion[C2] demotion[--] latency[000]
usage[00021770]
   *C2:                  type[C2] promotion[--] demotion[C1] latency[100]
