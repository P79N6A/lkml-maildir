Hmmm...  This is true, but I'd like to keep the topology functions as 
minimal as possible.  Since the functionality is so easily duplicated, 
and in almost every arch, is implemented almost identically, it seems a 
waste.  In most architectures, they itterate across cpus, either 
returning the first one on the node, or adding each to a mask and 
returning that.
Besides, it's not gone yet... ;)
Cheers!
