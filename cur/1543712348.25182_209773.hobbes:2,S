[warning: this is a tangent from the userspace sub-thread/topic]
	the kernel, of course, must manage topology, otherwise things
	Don't Get Done, and requests don't do where they should.  :)
	Part of the value of device mapper is that it provides container
	objects for multi-disk groups, and a common method of messing
	around with those container objects.  You clearly recognized the
	same need in emd... but I don't think we want two different
	pieces of code doing the same basic thing.
	I do think that metadata management needs to be fairly cleanly
	separately (I like what emd did, there) such that a user needs
	three in-kernel pieces:
	* device mapper
	* generic raid1 engine
	* personality module
	"personality" would be where the specifics of the metadata
	management lived, and it would be responsible for handling the
	specifics of non-hot-path events that nonetheless still need
	to be in the kernel.
