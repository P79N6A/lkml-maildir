hi,
I am trying to get my serial console to work so that the next time my
machine has an Oops. Buti, t doesn't seem to be working properly. I read
serial-console.txt and did the foll:
cd /dev
rm -f console tty0
mknod -m 622 console c 5 1
mknod -m 622 tty0 c 4 0
I also added the console entries in /etc/lilo.conf
cat /etc/lilo.conf
boot=/dev/sda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=50
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.13
        label=linux
        append="console=ttyS0,9600 console=tty0"
        root=/dev/sdb5
        read-only
and ran lilo.
Since I  dont have another linux machine, I connected a nullmodem from
COM2 of machine running WinNT to COM1 of my linux machine. On the NT
machine I ran hyperterminal and started 'capture text'
I also removed /etc/ioctl.save and reboot the machine.
On reboot, most of the messages appeared on the NT machine but some
messages like fsck output and 'starting sendmail' etc did not appear.
Any reason as to why they do not appear?
Also when I do 
insmod driver.o
the system panices due to some problem in driver.o. The panic messages
appear on the console but not on the serial console. Any reason?
Also when I write something to /dev/console it appears on the console
but not on the serial console. For writing to serial console I will have
to specifically write to /dev/ttyS0.
Can anybody tell me what I am doing wrong?
Please get back to me for more info.
Thanks in advance,
Raju
