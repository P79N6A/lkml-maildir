Subject: panic on bootup due to __GFP_ZERO patch

I'm getting a panic during pidmap_init with a backtrace that looks
something like:
buffered_rmqueue
__alloc_pages
get_zeroed_page
pidmap_init
start_kernel
Reverting the __GFP_ZERO patch fixes the issue, haven't drilled down
any deeper yet to see what in the patch is causing the problem.  This is
x86 w/out HIGHMEM (and no NUMA).
Any ideas?
thanks,
