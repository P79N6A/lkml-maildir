OK. Point taken.
I pull this patch pending some additional thinking.

Bad wording on my part.
By minor I meant, changes a single source file, doesn't change
interfaces, doesn't change code behavior beyond it's local scope.

ACK.
Though in my defense, solution [2] requires a massive surgery that would
have made this patch far more intrusive.

No locking what-so-ever is a bad idea. dump_stack/trace are being called
by non-fatal sources (sleep while atomic; stack-check; debugging) that
may produce problematic results if a static/shared buffer is being used
with no locks.
We can agree that using in-stack char buffer is very problematic -
especially given the fact that 4K is becoming the default build option.
I'll try and create an option 2 (static allocation, minimal locking)
patch and post ASAP.
Hopefully it'll fare better. (While keeping the current interface intact
and reducing the damage/noise)
