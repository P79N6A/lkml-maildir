It would be syncronous: but doing kernel_thread yourself means trying
to clean up using daemonize et al, which is incomplete and always
makes me nervous.
An implementation detail to users, but IMHO an important one.
Also, this replaces complete_and_exit: the thread can just exit.  This
simplifies things for the users, too...
