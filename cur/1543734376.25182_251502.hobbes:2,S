OK, I didn't know that. Thanks for the info.

Well, it makes things even uglier IMHO, so let's not do it.

I'm not much in favor of "fixing" old code just to make it gcc-3.5
compliant, especially when at the same time we won't clean it up,
potentially resulting in less readable code. I would be perfectly happy
with being able to compile 2.4 kernels with gcc versions up to 3.3 and
not above. What's the exact benefit of changing old and stable code in
the end of its life cycle for it to support future compilers? I don't
get it (but at the same time I am not the one deciding here).
This was a general comment. For the specific changes you propose, if
void* works like char* when it comes to arithmetics, it looks safe and
as such is (technically) fine with me.
Thanks.
