Dosemu does this now on single cpu systems.

gettimeofday always returns a time recently in the past.
And having an atomic variable by which keeps a generation number
for (xtime & other magic constants should be trivial).
Take one snapshot of the generation # at the start of gettimeofday,
another snapshot at the end of gettimeofday.  If the snapshots
don't match take the slow path, because you've had a race.
Yes you might need an appropriate memory barrier.

Not the only way not racy way see above.  Races are worth worrying about
but they have multiple solutions, transactions being one.
