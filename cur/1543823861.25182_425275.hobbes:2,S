I don't see any spinlocks in your code and the function does not
seem to be called from the interrupt handler or the softirq either.
Maybe I'm missed something, but where is this ever called in an
atomic context?

Whenever you have a device associated with the message, it makes
sense to use the dev_printk family of functions.

My understanding is that vendor IDs should go to the common file
because they are likely to be used by multiple drivers whereas
device IDs only need to be present in the one device driver for
that particular device.
