I just tested with latest -tip and I don't any problem with it.
With a single ftrace_printk("\n") on might_sleep() I get:
           <...>-2739  [000]   145.692153: __might_sleep:
           <...>-2739  [000]   145.692155: __might_sleep:
           <...>-2739  [000]   145.692157: __might_sleep:
           <...>-2739  [000]   145.692158: __might_sleep:
with trace or trace_iter file.
Does it always occur or in rare situations?
