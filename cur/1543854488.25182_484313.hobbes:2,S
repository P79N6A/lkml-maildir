The parent of the hpsb_host.
ohci1394 works on a pci_dev which contains a dev, let's call it A.
ieee1394 has a hpsb_host which contains a dev, let's call it B. B's
parent is A. Then there is one or more node_entry with dev C whose
parent is B, end unit_directory with dev D whose parent is C.
The bus of devices B, C, D is set to be ieee1394_bus_type, and that's
what knodemgrd is scanning.
knodemgrd blocks on the semaphore of the parent of B because
driver_detach took the semaphore of A (and of the parent of A if there
is one).

Right.

It's rescanning just the hpsb_host, but you surely got the picture now.

Excellently, that's what I will try in a minute. It is surely intended
that the hpsb_host can get a driver bound too, but as I mentioned, we
don't have a driver which needs this capability and I don't foresee any
such driver.
Thanks for the directions.
