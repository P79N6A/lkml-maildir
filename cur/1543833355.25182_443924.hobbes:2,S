looks good to me! A few minor nits:

remove the extra empty ' *' line above.

whitespace damage.
suggestion for future cleanups: this function (do_adjtimex()) should be 
cleaned up further to conform to the kernel coding style standard. 
(currently it has 4-space tabs, etc.) I did that before - maybe some of 
those cleanups still apply?
[obviously that cleanup shouldnt be part of this move-the-code patch.]
