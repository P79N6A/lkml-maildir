	That's closer the a proper test box than me, since I don't even have 
an that NIC ;)

	True, but since the patch uses a per-device lock, aren't we safe (and 
relatively scaleable) on SMP too?
	Using wait_event as "prepare_for_wait" and all that IMHO is needed 
because wait_event calls schedule, and we can't do that with our 
device lock held..hence the prepare_to_wait/spin_unlock/schedule stuff 
on mc32::wait_pending.
	I don't know if using 2 different locks is worth it, since we may 
starve mc_reload on SMP...but since the ammount of code dropped, it's 
worth testing to see if we scale better than the inline wait_pending 
stuff.

	Great!
	Please let me know when you have something...I'm really enjoying 
helping to fix this bug. :)

	There isn't.
	Maybe we won't make 2.6.0-test5, but there's no need to rush things. 
Let's get this right.
	Kind Regards,
Felipe
