It is *BIOS*, and that makes me nervous.
Anyway, I guess that for old boxen, it is okay to just put ide onto
/driver/legacy/XXX (and for new boxen probably too, we do not want
special code calling PnPbios/PCI just to put drivers to the right
place in the tree, right?)

PS: I suspect that those southbridge-integrated IDE controllers are
not *really* on PCI... They certainly do not use PCI IRQ A..D.
