Don't think so.  The problems I see are:
- It's a system-wide knob.  In many situations this will do the wrong
  thing.  Controlling pagecache should be per-process.
- Its heuristics for working out when to invalidate the pagecache will be
  too much for some situations and too little for others.
- Whatever we do, there will be some applications in some situations
  which are hurt badly by changes like this: they'll do heaps of extra IO.
Generally, the penalties for getting this stuff wrong are very very high:
orders of magnitude slowdowns in the right situations.  Which I suspect
will make any system-wide knob ultimately unsuccessful.
The ideal way of getting this *right* is to change every application in the
world to get smart about using sync_page_range() and/or posix_fadvise(),
then to add a set of command-line options to each application in the world
so the user can control its pagecache handling.
Obviously that isn't practical.  But what _could_ be done is to put these
pagecache smarts into glibc's read() and write() code.  So the user can do:
	MAX_PAGECACHE=4M MAX_DIRTY_PAGECACHE=2M rsync foo bar
This will provide pagecache control for pretty much every application.  It
has limitations (fork+exec behaviour??) but will be useful.
A kernel-based solution might use new rlimits, but would not be as flexible
or successful as a libc-based one, I suspect.
