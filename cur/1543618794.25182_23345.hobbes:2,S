Stable, no obvious problems or performance issues. CPU temperature at
32C during xmms, ssh usage.
mp3 playback is rock solid, even during heavy system load (two plus
compiles, mozilla etc), and also with no system load. mpeg-video
playback is smooth as always (mplayer with /dev/mga_vid), both with
heavy load and without heavy load.
kernel is 2.4.18-pre7 with preempt and lockbreak, plust a readlatency
patch.
However, I prefer amd_disconnect disabled, for obvious reasons pointed
out by other people on this list.. Temperature is now at an acceptable
42C after a while of normal load, using just acpi in kernel.
