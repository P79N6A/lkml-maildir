  For some reason (while I was away from network),  GMX.NET  servers
  have decided that  vger.kernel.org  is mail-bombing recipients.
  There are some 30-40 recipients of  linux-kernel  list at GMX.NET,
  and there are (varying) 100-300 emails per day for each of them.

  I forwarded to you, and all other GMX.NET domain subscribers the letter
  I have already sent to   postmaster@gmx.net  -- but you (as their 
  customers) may have more weight that an external nobody, like myself...
  Most common troubles that users have are:
    - "Relaying denied"  (in its many forms
	  -->   
http://vger.kernel.org/mxverify.html
 )
    - "Mailbox full"  (these lists are of HIGH VOLUME!)
    - DNS-lookup/connection timed out for 4+ days
  Then come various weird things, like overzealous reg-expr message
  content filters, broken MTA configurations  (don't people ever
  test that their changes do work ?),  etc...
