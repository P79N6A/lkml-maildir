OK, since you'll be hammering on the scsi drivers through the makefile
checking it all works, can I ask you to apply the Makefile patch first and
test the whole shebang?  I have tested it a little, but not a large chunk.

romping through the rest of the drivers/ directory, maybe drivers/block
next.
