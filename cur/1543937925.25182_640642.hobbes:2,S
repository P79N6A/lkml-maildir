Though it seems it could legally transform:
void kfree(const int *x);
{
int v, *ptr = malloc(sizeof(int));
*ptr = 51;
v = *ptr;
kfree(ptr);
printf("%d", v);
into:
{
int v, *ptr = malloc(sizeof(int));
*ptr = 51;
kfree(ptr);
v = *ptr;
printf("%d", v);
}
if it knows that malloc generates unaliased pointers, which seems
reasonable in general.
