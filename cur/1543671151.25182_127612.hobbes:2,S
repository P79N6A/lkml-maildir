Subject: [TRIVIAL PATCH 2.5.68-bk latest] allow modular JBD

Currently, when I build ext3 as a module, jbd gets built into the kernel
proper. This trivial patch allows jbd to be built as a module when ext3
is also modular. I believe this is the intention, as this is how it
works in 2.4. I've built and tested with modular jbd and ext3 on 2.5.68.
Please apply.
Thanks,
