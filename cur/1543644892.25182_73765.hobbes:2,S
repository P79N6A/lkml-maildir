Ok, fair enough.
The loop (which performs a number of repeated identical writes to the
*same* location) along with the comment does look pretty scary though

Yep - so does Reiser. I originally believed that this was not the case
with modern disks, but I think I was corrected on that one in the Reiser
bug thread   :)

Originally it was my impression that the index was written fairly
frequently, *and* that you did not have the atomic-sector-write
guarantee.
That's why I was very worried.

RAID wouldn't save me in the case where the journal index is screwed due
to a partial sector write and a power loss.
But anyway, that is a moot point  :)
Thank you for explaining,
(/me hopes the scary-loop dies  ;)
