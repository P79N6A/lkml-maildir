Ok,  I finally managed to get responses from all the individual
contributors,  though none of the corporations contacted have responded.
While a good number of those contacted were happy to dual-license,  most
are concerned that changes made under the GPL will not be available for
use in BSD.  A couple were a definate no.
I have had offers to rewrite any portions that can not be dual-licensed,
but I think that is overkill for now unless there is significant
interest in taking that path.
Fortunately we have been able to obtain some funding to complete a large
amount of work on the project so it should have some nice progress in the
next couple of weeks as that ramps up :-)
Cheers,
Davidm
