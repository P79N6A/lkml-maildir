  Hi, all. Version 123 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This is against 2.3.20. Highlights of this release:
- Ported to kernel 2.3.20
<FLAMEWAR NOTE>
I know some people are wondering why I've been silent. Well, I can't
be bothered going over the same old tired ground again. Pretty much
every point has been debated many times before.
Even many of the "technical" points raised are a mixture of FUD, myth
and ignorance. Or simply a lack of *careful* reading of the FAQ or
source. Just one simple example: Alex and Ted's assertion that devfs
can only be mounted once. Have a look around line 45 of the FAQ for
the facts.
So I'm not going to respond until I see something new, relevant and
technically sound. Assuming I don't miss it amidst the flames and
noise. Oh. And don't Cc me in this flamewar.
Finally, a small number of people (on both sides) have been abusive,
personal and insulting. I can't stop you, and it's not my place to
tell people what to do, but I'd rather you didn't do it. It helps
no-one.
