Subject: [PATCH] generic ACPI support

I've gone a couple rounds with Linus on this
patch for generic (ie. not PIIX4 specific) ACPI
support and I think I've won his tentative
approval.  I would appreciate feedback from
anybody else that is interested.
The patch is very minimal and most of the work
(the AML interpreter) will be done by a user-space
daemon (acpid).  The patch is attached and a
skeleton acpid is available from
