This change is obviously good, can't it go into the previous patch?

I still think this patch is questionable. Please look at my previous
response 
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=119262203729543
In short: with this patch it is not possible to guarantee that work->fun()
will run on the correct CPU.

Looks wrong. It is possible that cwq->thread == NULL, because currently we
never "shrink" cpu_populated_map.

Yes. But there is nothing new. Currently, work->func() can't share the locks
with cpu_down's patch. Not only only it can't take workqueue_mutex, it can't
take any other lock which could be taken by notifier callbacks, etc.
Can't we ignore this problem, at least for now? I believe we need intrusive
changes to solve this problem correctly. Perhaps I am wrong, of course, but
I don't see a simple solution.
Another option. Note that get_online_cpus() does more than just pinning
cpu maps, actually it blocks hotplug entirely. Now let's look at
schedule_on_each_cpu(), for example. It doesn't need to block hotplug,
it only needs a stable cpu_online_map.
Suppose for a moment that _cpu_down() does cpu_hotplug_done() earlier,
right after __cpu_die(cpu) which removes CPU from the map (yes, this
is wrong, I know). Now, we don't need to change workqueue_cpu_callback(),
work->func() can use get_online_cpus() without fear of deadlock.
So, can't we introduce 2 nested rw locks? The first one blocks cpu hotplug
(like get_online_cpus does currently), the second one just pins cpu maps.
I think most users needs only this, not more.
What do you think?
(Gautham, I apologize in advance, can't be responsive till weekend).
