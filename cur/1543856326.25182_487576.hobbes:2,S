Just read this, sorry.
The majority of ARM CPU implementations have pure virtual caches
_without_ process IDs.  (Some have a nasty hack which involves
remapping the lower 32MB of virtual memory space to other areas
of the cache's virtual space, but obviously that limits you to
32MB of VM.)
Thankfully, with ARM version 6, they had an inkling of clue, and
decided to move to VIPT caches but with _optional_ aliasing, and
if the CPU design was Harvard there's a possibility for D/I cache
aliasing.

Absolutely.  Can we start such a program in Cambridge, England ASAP
please?
