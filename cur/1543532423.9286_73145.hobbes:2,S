I'll keep this short.  If I fetch an "alpha" testing patch such as the
one from Friday (pre7-6) how can I incrementally patch up to pre7-7 or
to 2.3.99-pre7, i.e. whichever comes next?  Or do I just keep a copy of
pre-6 and then patch it with pre-7 once the beta finally comes out.
I've worn the net out searching through various Linux places.  A pointer
would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks, and sorry for the noise.
B.
