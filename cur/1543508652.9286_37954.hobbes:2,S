Overall, I am pleased with this thread.  I was referring to 2.2 for both
KNFSD and RAID, but RAID can wait till 2.4.  As the Marvelous Mr. Mingo
(I'm sure that's not his last name, but it alliterates so well) has said
he will do his upmost to get RAID done for the 2.3 tree, I am happy.
I would hope that till 2.4, Alan and Co. will take care (I'm very sure
they will, though) that they don't massively break RAID unexpectly.
I have been told, but I don't know, that large amounts of the RAID .90
stuff cannot easily co-exist with the RAID currently in the 2.2 tree,
making a configuration option difficult.  I was wondering if parts of the
RAID 0.90 can't be merged into 2.2, that don't break current RAID stuff.
I don't have the time right now to look into it and learn what it all
does. :(
Ciao!
