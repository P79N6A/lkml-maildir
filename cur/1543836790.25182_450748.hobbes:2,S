The difference is that every hypervisor wants its own patched 
instruction sequence, which may require a specialized patching 
mechanism.  If you're simply patching in calls, then it isn't a big 
deal, but you may also want to patch in real inlined code for some 
operations (like sti/cli equivalents).  The alternatives are to allow 
each backend to deal with its own patching (perhaps with common 
functions abstracted out as they appear), or have a common set of 
patching machinery which can deal with all users.  The former seems simpler.
