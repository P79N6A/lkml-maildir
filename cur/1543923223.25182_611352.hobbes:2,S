In fact, our team only has boards with RS690+SB700 and RX790+SB700,
I don't know why the RD580 MSI is disabled too by the patch
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commi
t;h=aea6a433f50cd89b9cbd10850fd0b32f961f9883
Maybe Tejun can give us more information on this case,
I think the cause should be same as RS690 and RX790.
If you need some small test on USB issue related with RS480 or
something else, you may tell me, I can try to ask the help from our
SW QA or test by myself, if we can find out such test platform.
Thanks
Shane
