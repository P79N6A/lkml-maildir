Yes, Ingo did a great job fixing the SMP stuff, which in
turn made possible some scheduling optimizations which
he also did along the way...
In fact, he did such a great job that I have decided
to start from the ground up with my scheduler bigpatch.
A lot of the extra optimizations that were in there are
not needed any more :)
cheers,
