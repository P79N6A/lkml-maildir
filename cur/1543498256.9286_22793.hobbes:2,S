Has anybody ever considered using NIST's network simulation stuff for
benchmarking purposes?  The home page is
http://snad.ncsl.nist.gov/itg/nistnet/.
  It basically can produce an
artificial packet loss and latency, thereby providing a much more
realistic network environment for benchmarks than common benchmarks
currently do.
