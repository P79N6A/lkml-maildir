Hi,
I have a cPCI chassis, (21slots) in groups of 7. These groups are
connected by intel 21154 (PCI Bridges). I use Single Board Computer,
ZT5524 from PT which has standard Linux kernel 2.4.27(without any
patch) running on it.
The Linux kernel is unable to detect the Bridges present on the
chassis. Is there any patch available for adding cPCI support to Linux
kernel?
dmesg does not indicate anything at all. No warnnings no errors. Not
even lspci -M giving any clues.
Please CC me as I have not subcribed to the list.
