By the way, _does_ anyone have a contact at nVidia who could clarify? Alan 
maybe? I'm quite curious what they did...
Summary:
Unless after booting with "acpi=off", outputs to port 0x80 (the legacy way 
to delay I/O) reliably, but not immediately, hang MCP51 machines. Outputs to 
port 0xed do not indicating it's a not a generic bus abort problem.
