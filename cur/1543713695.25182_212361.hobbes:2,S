40C?  Shut down for an hour to cool, I've never seen the post on my 
board show less than 63C by the time it gets to that part of the 
bios.  I'm running a 1400DX at 1400mhz, so the bios thinks its a 
1600DX, and I've got vcore set down to 1.65 volts which helps a bit.
Actually, the athlons seem to have a builtin shutdown at 75C, I've hit 
that once or 3 times when the air under the desk was trapped worse 
than usual.  Makes for downright ugly reboots...
