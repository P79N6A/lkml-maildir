Release the -rc kernel when it is stable. Then people will test them,
and then they'll hopefully catch the small annoyances that give our
real releases a bad reputation.

Well they aren't in the current scheme. When doing real release candidates,
they'll test* because they _are_ worried about bugs, and testing an -rc is
an easy way to get all your little compilation problems fixed, and all your
strage usb drivers working again for the realease. And without someone
rewriting the page table code in the meantime.
I could be completely wrong, but that's my feeling.
* Maybe not on their live corporate database server though
