     Well, the simple solution to that would be to #define
     NO_FANCY_MEMORY and build a custom kernel.  It's also dimly
     possible that that one machine is running into a buglet in your
     code (I certainly found some buglets in mine when I moved it over
     to 2.2.9 from 2.0.28; though in my case it wasn't a subtle
     interaction against one bios, but a infinite reboot machine on
     every machine around :-() or it could be that the bios in question
     is actually broken.

     I can't say for your testsuite, but I own 486 machines that do
     properly support e820, and which let me put in memory holes.

     david parsons \bi/ and it's also possible it's some interaction with
                    \/       bzImages, which I have to use with 2.2.x :-(
