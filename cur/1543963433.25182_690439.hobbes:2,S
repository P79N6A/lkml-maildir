There are folks who want to be able to get information about hugepages
from pagemap. Thanks to Hans, there's room in the output format for it.
I'd gone to some lengths to pull VMAs out of the picture as it's quite
ugly to have to simultaneously walk VMAs and pagetables. But I may have
to concede that living with hugepages requires it.
