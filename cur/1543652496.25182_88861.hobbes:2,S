I think swappiness should depend also on mem/disk latency ratio.
Imagine you have 32Gb IDE 'disk' made internally of tons of DRAM chips
(such things exist). I suppose you would like to swap more to it,
since access times are not ~10 ms, they are more like 10 us.
Hand tuning for optimal performance is doomed to be periodically
obsoleted by technology jumps. Today RAM is 1000000 times faster
than mass storage. Nobody knows what will happen in five years.
