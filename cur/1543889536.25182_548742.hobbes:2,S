NORET_TYPE didn't do any harm because it expanded to /**/. But yes,
removing it does remove the annotations / markers for ATTRIB_NORET
candidates, as I first mentioned to Rday.
But later on going through the code, I noticed that:
1. Most of the combined occurrences of NORET_TYPE along with
ATTRIB_NORET were in function _declarations_. So here, what
we want is to simply remove the NORET_TYPE, and *not* replace
it with ATTRIB_NORET, because it's already there!
2. Most of the single-occurrences (NORET_TYPE alone, without any
ATTRIB_NORET) were in function _implementations_. So here, what
we want is to simply remove the NORET_TYPE, and *not* introduce
any ATTRIB_NORET, because it's not required!
In such a situation, merging a patch that simply gets rid of
NORET_TYPE (i.e. s/NORET_TYPE//) actually ends up doing the
right thing!
... *however* ... as I mentioned next, unfortunately the above 2 points
did not hold for _all_ occurrences of NORET_TYPE. There were
some exceptions (which also I mentioned) where we want to do
somethings slightly more complicated, so I put the ball in Rday's
court -- he had originally expressed a wish to avoid doing complicated
things in this patch.
