top doesn't run all the time:
# strace -o top.strace -tt top

However, kernel compile shouldn't.
I suggest stracing with -tt "for(;;) yield();" test proggy with and without
kernel compile in parallel, and comparing the output...
Hmm... actually, knowing that you will argue to death instead...
# cat t.c
#include <sched.h>
int main() {
    for(;;) sched_yield();
    return 0;
}
# gcc t.c
# strace -tt ./a.out
