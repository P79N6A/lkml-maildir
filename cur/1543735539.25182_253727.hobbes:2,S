Indeed.
I don't see what is so far for distributions to overcome here - if you
want to avoid having two sets of alternative init scripts, why not
have a generic set of /etc/dev.d entries that are either called by
udev or if udev is not available run them in some predetermined order
on a static device tree. What's the hassle here? I can't see anything
world shattering.
Cheers,
Jon.
