It is not a limit, it is the system level number of tasks assumed by the
numtasks controller, so, it cannot be a _no limit_, it has to be real
number.
If one doesn't want a controller, they can avoid compiling it in, and
numtasks even allows one to use it as a module.
If your real concern is that the number is too small, we can make it
bigger.

we can make it 1 million / second (or minute).
