       The admutils pkg at most sunsites is still v1.18 whereas the
       admutils pkg at 
ftp://ftp.daimi.aau.dk
       is v1.24
OK - I'll check versions and update where necessary.
       Another problem I'm encountering with passwd is that the setpwname
       uses the libc   link(), unlink() and rename() functions. Presently
       with the Linux v2.2.x and libc v2.07pre7-v2.0.112 and v2.1 there
Ah - I do not understand why this has not been plastered with
big fat letters all over 2.2.x Changes:
	DO NOT USE 2.2.[0-5] WITH FAT, VFAT, UMSDOS. IT IS BROKEN.
(More generally, there is no reason to suppose that 2.2.x is stable
for any filesystem other than ext2. However, in the vfat case the
problems are probably well understood, and Alexander Viro has
produced patches that you may try, maybe at
ftp://ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/rename
+fat-patch-8.gz .)
Let me cc the Changes maintainer.
Best regards, Andries
