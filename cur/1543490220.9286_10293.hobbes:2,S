Ok ---
I've been having random lockups on one of my boxes. Its a bit of a pain to
catch, as I can't MAKE it happen, just wait for it to happen.
The biggest problem, though, has been screen blanking. I've been trying to
catch a lockup so that I can Alt-SYSrq-P to see EIP.
But my screen blanks. Every 15m or so. Period. Nothing will stop it from
blanking.
setterm -blank 0
is ignored. setterm -blank <anything> is ignored. So my machine locksup, I
can't see what sysrq outputs.
How do I turn off screen blanking, completely? I'm not using a fb device,
just your standard vga console (2.2.3, btw, redhat 5.2 based).
?? Help ??
Also, while I'm on the horn here, is there a kernel parameter (ala lilo)
that allows you to turn off the "Use UDMA where available by default" ?
Thanx!
G'day!
