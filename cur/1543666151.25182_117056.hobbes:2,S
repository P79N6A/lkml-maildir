  copy(-and-checksum) is needed for write*(), and during copying,
  the checksumming can be thrown in essentially for free.
  For sendfile(), the system does not need to do such copying,
  and these days devices can be reported as capable to handle
  e.g. tcp checksumming built in.
  Loopback device does not bother with checksums -- it is coming
  from within the box, no point in checking such things.
  ( see:  drivers/net/loopback.c   -- there are most curious set
    of initialized   dev->features  flags. )

  It may well be correct report, but to calculate those would be
  wasted effort.

  Quite so.
