Cannot reproduce, sorry.  Kernel is 2.6.5-rc1, disk is a "MAXTOR 6L080J4"
time write-and-fsync -m 256 -f foo
writeback caching off, ext3/ordered:
  write-and-fsync -m 256 -f foo  0.00s user 1.19s system 4% cpu 24.247 total
writeback caching off, XFS:
  write-and-fsync -m 256 -f foo  0.00s user 0.57s system 2% cpu 24.041 total
writeback caching on, ext3/ordered:
  write-and-fsync -m 256 -f foo  0.00s user 1.16s system 14% cpu 8.169 total
writeback caching on, XFS:
  write-and-fsync -m 256 -f foo  0.00s user 0.58s system 8% cpu 6.950 total
  write-and-fsync -m 256 -f foo  0.00s user 0.54s system 6% cpu 8.109 total
  write-and-fsync -m 256 -f foo  0.00s user 0.55s system 5% cpu 10.057 total
  write-and-fsync -m 256 -f foo  0.00s user 0.56s system 8% cpu 6.870 total
(quite some variability in XFS)
So...   Maybe you could test some other disks or something?
