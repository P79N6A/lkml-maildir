Hi all,
I found a bug that cause the kernel to lockup.
The problem is in mm/shmem.c do_shmem_file_read() (the tmpfs)
at line 959 there is a call to file_read_actor(desc, page, offset, nr);
The problem is that inside the function file_read_actor() desc->error is
set to -EFAULT (this happens when the buffer supplied by the user for the 
read is wrong)
but there is no check right after the return from file_read_actor() to
test this situation.
The result is that the desc->count field always stay the same and the
while loop in do_shmem_file_read never end and the kernel locksup.
The fix is very simple just add the following line after the call to 
file_read_actor():
-------------------
if(desc->error)
	break
-------------------
If you need any other info please mail me
Regards
--lior
