unmap_buffer() calls mark_buffer_clean() calls refile_buffer() calls
remove_inode_queue(), which is why we don't see this all the time.
However, refile_buffer() is only calling the remove_inode_queue() if
the buffer disposition changes.  I'm looking to see where we may be
going wrong here --- the refile_buffer() is not atomic wrt. the
bh->b_inode structures.
