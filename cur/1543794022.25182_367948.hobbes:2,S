Once, when my /var partition got trashed - about thirty or forty loud
and scary messages from the IDE core saying that various disk accesses
(i.e. normal read/writes) were failing. I do believe DMA was
mentioned.
Another time (i.e. just now), I got five Oopses in a row, most of them
in kmem_cache_alloc() but with one in generic_aio_file_read(). 
Unfortunately I am using fglrx right now so they are probably quite
meaningless...*
Most of the time though, I don't see anything.
Fortunately the number of errors encouraged the kernel to remount R/O,
so after a quick jump to single user mode and two e2fsck -f
invocations, it was healed.

They started with 2.6.13. I can't remember ever expereincing random
partition trashing or random file corruption in 2.6.12. I tried
2.6.14.1 - that kernel did Bad Things as well.
So far though, as long as I stay on juice, 2.6.13 seems to behave.
