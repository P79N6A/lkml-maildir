2.6.16-rc5 with disable_msi=1 works for me, no hangs seen so far. I rsynced 80 
GB of data, thats about 5-10 times more than I typically need to reproduce a 
hang, so it seems to be solid. For the record: 2.6.16-rc5 with disable_msi=0 
does hang.
I have not seen the memory trashing others reported, with no version I tested 
so far. Maybe my scenario is not likely to trigger this, so I can't tell.
Unless a fix for msi is at hand, may I suggest for 2.6.16 to revert the msi 
commit or switch the default to disable_msi=1?
I've updated bugzilla #6084 accordingly.
