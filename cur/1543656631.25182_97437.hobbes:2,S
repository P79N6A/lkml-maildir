Only in the qualitative sense. No statistically significant differences
in running times are observable.

I was not able to collect this information and would be much obliged
to hear of how to do so for instruction cache profiling.

There is no reason why it could not be re-established for the Pee Cee
case. IMHO It would be excellent to have the proper architecture
discrimination defines in place so that Pee Cees could utilize the vastly
simpler calculation. So long as this is devolved to arch code there is no
danger of page->virtual being required by arch-independent code.
