Subject: possible deadlock in sys_pivot_root()?

Hello,
sys_pivot_root() first takes BKL, then ->i_sem on the old root
directory. On the other hand, vfs_readdir() first takes ->i_sem on a
directory and then calls file system ->readdir() method, that usually
takes BKL. Isn't there a deadlock possibility? Of course,
sys_pivot_root() is probably not supposed to be called frequently, but
still.
Nikita.
