There's a development version
ftp://lrcftp.epfl.ch/pub/people/almesber/lilo/lilo-22dev0.tar.gz
it has EDD (i.e. supports disk > 1024 cylinders) done in an way
that I'm not happy with anymore, having seen John Coffman's work.
Don't expect lilo-22 before mid-April or such, though. I still
have too many other things in my queue, and I don't want this to
be a rush job.
