Robert and others,
Will inotify watch directories recursively?  A quick browse through the
source doesn't look like it, but I very well could be wrong.  Last I
checked, dnotify did not either.  I am looking for a way to synchronize
files in as-real-as-possible-time when they are modified.  The ideal
implementation would be a kernel "hook" like d/inotify and a client
application that watches changes and copies them to a remote server for
redundancy purposes.   A scheduled rsync works decently, but has a lag
time of 2-3 (or more) hours on certain files on a large filesystem.
Will inotify work for this, or does someone else have another
recommended solution to the problem?
Thanks,
Dale
