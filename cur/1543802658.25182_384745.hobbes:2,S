The application has no clue (and must not know) the internal workings
of the kernel. In the following code, both forks must work, the case
in which the child executed immediately, and the case in which the
child did some work or slept before it exited.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
int main()
{
     pid_t pid;
     int status;
     switch((pid = fork()))
     {
     case 0:    // child
         exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
     case -1:	// Error
         perror("fork");
         exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
     default:	// Parent
         waitpid(pid, &status, 0);
         break;
     }
     switch((pid = fork()))
     {
     case 0:    // child
         sleep(10);
         exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
     case -1:	// Error
         perror("fork");
         exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
     default:	// Parent
         waitpid(pid, &status, 0);
         break;
     }
     return 0;
}
The code has no clue whether or not the child started before
waitpid was called. It knows it has a valid pid, which is only a
promise that such a child will start execution sometime or
that it once existed and has already expired. That pid must
remain valid until somebody reaps the status of the expired
child.

The pid will (must) always be valid until after the status is reaped.
There should not be any flags used to synchronize anything here. That
pid just cannot be reused until the child is out of the Z state and
its status has been obtained. Then the pid can be reused. It's the
Z state that has historically provided the needed synchronization.
