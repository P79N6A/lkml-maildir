Hi,
I want to do a non-blocking read from a file, from within the kernel.
Is this, at all, possible? I have been tracing how userspace does this,
but the userspace does not seem to be non-blocking either.
What I'd expect is this:
* non-blocking read is issued
* if the pages are in the pagecache, they are copied to my buffer
* if they are not, an asynchronous read-ahead is issued and the
  read-funtion returns -EAGAIN
By looking at the code (2.3.6), there seems to be no possibility to do
this. Am I wrong or is it not worth the effort (I might disagree) or just
impossible?
Greetings,
  Arjan van de Ven
