I think you're right... I've applied the patch to 2.6.7, and I'm still 
running after a boot-suspend-resume cycle. Hopefully it isn't just a 
fluke :)
The original patch seems to have been logged at the time of 2.6.6. Was 
it just too late to make 2.6.7? Will it be fixed in 2.6.8?
Thanks.
  Hamish.
