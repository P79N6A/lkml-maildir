Other filesystems already implement the write_super_lockfs and unlockfs
methods and should just work.  An earlier version of this patch is in
SuSE's tree and I think they've tested it with ext3 and reiserfs.
Similarly even earlier variants are in the 2.4 vendor trees.  Those
filesystem don't really use the state machine to avoid starting new
transactions, so to get results as reliable as XFS they need soem more
work.
