Calling a varargs function with no prototype in scope is undefined
behavior.
For instance, when I designed a C calling convention in a class long
ago (for some mips-li[kt]e instruction set), I decided that the first
few arguments of normal functions would be passed in registers, but in
varargs functions all arguments would be passed on the stack.  This is a
perfectly legal under the C standard, even though calling printf without
a declaration visible would break.
