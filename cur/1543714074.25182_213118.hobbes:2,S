Hi,
I recently ugraded from 2.4.23 to 2.6.5. Everything works fine, except for
my mouse: when I press the buttons on the left side of the mouse, the system
generates button press/release events for the proper buttons and for the
buttons on the top of the mouse. The mouse worked well with 2.4.23.
I use a mixed Debian woody/sarge system.
Example output from xev (I pressed and released one of the buttons on the
side):
ButtonPress event, serial 23, synthetic NO, window 0x1800001,
    root 0x46, subw 0x0, time 3567154224, (56,106), root:(793,193),
    state 0x0, button 5, same_screen YES
ButtonPress event, serial 23, synthetic NO, window 0x1800001,
    root 0x46, subw 0x0, time 3567154224, (56,106), root:(793,193),
    state 0x0, button 3, same_screen YES
ButtonRelease event, serial 23, synthetic NO, window 0x1800001,
    root 0x46, subw 0x0, time 3567154393, (56,106), root:(793,193),
    state 0x400, button 5, same_screen YES
ButtonRelease event, serial 23, synthetic NO, window 0x1800001,
    root 0x46, subw 0x0, time 3567154393, (56,106), root:(793,193),
    state 0x400, button 3, same_screen YES
The events for button 3 should not be there..
Mouse related lines from dmesg:
mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
input: ImExPS/2 Generic Explorer Mouse on isa0060/serio1
X11 version, configuration:

        Option          "Device"                "/dev/psaux"

        Option          "ZAxisMapping"          "6 7"
EndSection
Various stuff I tried to make the mouse work properly:
Plugging it in the USB port of my machine: no change.
Loading the psmouse module with the "proto=exps" parameter: no change.
Changing the mouse protocol to ImPS/2: no change/got worse.
Any help would be appreciated..
