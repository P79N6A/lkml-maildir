Will RMK (rmk@arm.linux.org.uk) please fix his email setup otherwise I
can't send serial/tty/arm stuff to him.
"<<< 550 You have no reverse DNS; please try again when you have resolved
that error 554 5.0.0 Service unavailable"
Difficult to tell what you've got wrong but the delivering host does have
a reverse DNS, and the mail address is an MX so if you are trying to turn
that into a reverse A record you have some problems with your scripts.
