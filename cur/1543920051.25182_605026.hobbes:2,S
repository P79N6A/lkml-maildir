You mean xfs_buf.c.
And yes, we delay unmapping pages until we have a batch of them
to unmap. vmap and vunmap do not scale, so this is batching helps
alleviate some of the worst of the problems.

The xfsbufd cleans out any stale mappings - it's woken by the memory
shrinker interface (i.e. calls xfsbufd_wakeup()). Otherwise every
64th buffer being vmap()d will flush out stale mappings.
Realistically, if this delayed release of vmaps is a problem for
Xen, then I think that some generic VM solution is needed to this
problem as vmap() is likely to become more common in future (think
large blocks in filesystems). Nick - any comments?
Cheers,
Dave.
