we have tried this too, and this has problems too (artificial inflation 
of the vruntime metric and a domino effects on other portions of the 
scheduler). So this is a worse solution than what we have now. (and this 
has all been pointed out in past discussions in which David 
participated. I'll certainly reply to any genuinely new idea.)
