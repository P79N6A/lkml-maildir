OK;
Previously described behavior is with remote console = ENABLED in the bios.
Changing to remote console = POST ONLY in the bios, (and disabling 2nd 
serial port which doesn't have a DB9 anyway) I get
Serial: 8250/16550 driver $Revision: 1.90 $ IRQ sharing disabled
ttyS0: autoconf (0x03f8, 0x00000000): iir=3 iir1=6 iir2=6 type=16550A
tts/0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
ttyS1: autoconf (0x02f8, 0x00000000): IER test failed (ff, ff) type=unknown
ttyS2: autoconf (0x03e8, 0x00000000): IER test failed (ff, ff) type=unknown
ttyS3: autoconf (0x02e8, 0x00000000): IER test failed (ff, ff) type=unknown
Which looks good to me. And I get some serial console output from the 
kernel as it boots, but only upto...

...where the serial output hangs. I presume the serial driver does 
something to the hardware which breaks the serial console output. The 
kernel does however proceed and boot normally. I'm using the kernel 
parameters

Comments?
