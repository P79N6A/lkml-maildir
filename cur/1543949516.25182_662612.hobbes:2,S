Independent of this specific issue and even ignoring the question 
whether binary-only Linux kernel drivers are legal at all there are a 
few points to note:
First of all, Linux is great for many people and in many cases. But 
buying a computer with a $600 graphics card for gaming under Linux 
doesn't make sense. Simply because having the latest desktop hardware 
perfectly supported and with perfect performance is not yet realistic 
under Linux (and there's more than just the graphics card in a computer).
And binary-only kernel drivers have the problems that noone except for 
the vendor can debug them. Some binary-only graphics drivers are 
well-known for having caused quite a few kernel kernel crashes under 
Linux - and this harms the reputation of Linux as a stable operating 
system.
