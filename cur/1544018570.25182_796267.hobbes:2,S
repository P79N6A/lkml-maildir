The user-space breakpoint requests face an issue due to removal of
HW_BREAKPOINT_EXECUTE support, since ptrace was made to service these
requests through the __register_user_hw_breakpoint() interface.
Through offline discussions, the suggestion gathered was to let ptrace
process these requests for instruction watchpoint while maintaining a
coherent view on the number of available registers.
I will send out a patch that refactors ptrace to handle instruction
watchpoint requests (until we get it to support through our interface),
which should also contain changes to the corresponding comments and
'name' field.
