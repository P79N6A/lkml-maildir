refile_buffer blocks only if the buffer is been marked dirty and it wasn't
in the dirty lru list.
How can a dirty buffer not be in the dirty lru list at brelse time?
If you grep for BH_Dirty you'll see that nobody sets BH_Dirty by hand and
everybody uses mark_buffer_dirty (and that's definitly correct). Thus
brelse can't block in 2.2.x as well as far I can tell.
I assumed the refile buffer there was for cleanup and not for write
throttling (that's the only case that can block).
