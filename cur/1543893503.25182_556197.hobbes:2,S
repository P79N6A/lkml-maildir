the problem with that is that if anything downstream from the iommu 
layer ALSO needs memory, we've now eaten up the last free page and 
things go splat.
in terms of deadlock avoidance... I wonder if we need something 
similar to the swap token; once a process dips into the emergency 
pool, it becomes the only one that gets to use this pool, so that it's 
entire chain of allocations will succeed, rather than each process 
only getting halfway through...
But yeah it's minute details and you can argue either way is the right 
approach.
You can even argue for the old highmem.c approach; go into half the 
pool before going to the VM, then to kmalloc() and if that fails dip 
into the second half of the pool.
