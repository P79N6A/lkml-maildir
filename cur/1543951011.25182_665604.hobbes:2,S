We have had PAGE_MASK being signed on powerpc for ages, so if you do
find any such bugs, please let me know. :)  I'm not aware of any at
present, though.
The expression you quoted will be ok as long as either size_avail or
rg.size is unsigned, as far as I can see.
Our PAGE_SIZE is unsigned long.
Paul.
