Subject: [PATCH] some sysfs patches for 2.6.0 [0/4]

Here are 4 sysfs related patches for 2.6.0.  They do the following:
  - fix an oops in sysfs when a kobject has been unregistered before
    it's child has.  An example of this is the oops that happens in
    2.6.0 whenever a usb-serial device is removed that has a port open
    by a user (almost all Pilot devices do this by virtue of the
    protocol...)
  - add sysfs support to the following char drivers:
  	- mem devices (/dev/null and friends)
	- misc devices (/dev/psaux and other odd devices)
	- vc devices
Please apply these to 2.6.0 or your -mm tree depending on how
comfortable you are with them.
thanks,
greg k-h
