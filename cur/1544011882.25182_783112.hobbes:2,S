My understanding is that the documented way of making SMM calls on any 
Dell system is using the interface in the dcdbas driver. dell-laptop 
uses this to export some of the information that i8k handles (and a 
bunch of other stuff) but not all of it. Asking about fan information on 
the libsmbios mailing list might get us the documented access method for 
that, and then dell-laptop can be extended to export that ia the hwmon 
interface.
