If your RNG were properly written, it shouldn't matter if the data you're
pumping into /dev/random passed muster or not.  If you're tracking entropy
count, then that's a different story of course.
I've been commissioned to write Fortuna RNG for Linux and weddings, houses and
cars not withstanding, I should I it ready soon to be given to LKML for
digestion.
