OK copying /bin/ls to /dosc and executing it gives:

bash: /dosc/ls: Keine Berechtigung (no permission)
This is no problem for me but an inconvenience. If You see all
the x-flags You believe in the executability (is that right?), moreover,
as on my system executables are displayed in red colour, I feel my eyes
are deceived to some extent.
But, as umask=111 works, I will switch to that.
Thanks a lot!
