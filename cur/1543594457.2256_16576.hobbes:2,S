Hi,
I have a Soltek AT motherboard with
- a 440LX/EX chipset
- a celeron 533
- 96 mb of ram (tested with memtest86, just to be sure)
- an ATI rage pro (agp)
- a western digital harddisk
- a 3c509b
that's it, nothing fancy.
But ever since the 2.4 series (i used 2.4.3, 2.4.4acXX, and now 
2.4.5ac7) i get spontaneous reboots quite often. Usually it isn't doing 
anything fancy when it happens, no harddisk activity or memory pressure, 
it just pops and croaks.
I'm using reiserfs by the way.
Just thought i'd mention it, because i've seen other people having 
spontaneous reboots with LX chipsets.
