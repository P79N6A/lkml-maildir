That sounds correct. If you pass the lookup intents down to the
underlying filesystem while doing the lookup, then all should be well:
NFS will actually open the file for you at that point too, whereas most
other filesystems will just look it up and return the dentry.
In any case, you avoid the race, because you lookup/revalidate the
underlying dentry at the same time as you lookup/revalidate the unionfs
dentry.
Cheers,
