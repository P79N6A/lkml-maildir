Subject: CLONE_KILLVMCH flag proposal

Hello
I am trying to modify pthread library a way in which it  would not
need manager thread. It seems that it is pretty feasible with
CLONE_PARENT but one thing is missing.
If the main thread dies due to some fatal error other threads will live
further. This problem is not easily solved without manager thread so
kernel will have to help here.
This is an proposal for CLONE_KILLVMCH. The process/thread that
has this flag set will kill all its children that share the same VM
(were created with CLONE_VM) when it dies.
This way the main thread will clean threads when some fatal error
or kill occurs that cannot be caught in user space.
I think that this is the only obstacle to make pthread support without
manager thread and thus solve performance problems with creating and
managing threads.
Any ideas are highly appreciated.
Here goes the patch that implement CLONE_KILLVMCH. I think it is not
perfect but consider something like this as addition to the kernel.
best regards
Pavel
