Hi all,
	The `make pdfdocs' target still fails for me on the
`writing_usb_drivers' document.  There's one small bug in it, and one
problem I haven't figured out yet.
	There is a malformed <literal>blah<literal> sequence, where the
closing tag is instead an opening tag.  Patch for that below.
	Also, when the TeX back-end runs, for some reason, ConTeX seems
to get referenced and I get this (trimmed):

! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [save size=5000].
But when I generate it manually from the sgml file that was generated, i.e.:
jade -t tex -d /usr/share/sgml/docbook/utils-0.6.9/docbook-utils.dsl
 -i print -o foo.tex ../Documentation/DocBook/writing_usb_driver.sgml
jadetex foo.tex
I get a proper dvi file.
Converting to RTF also works:
jade -t rtf -d /usr/share/sgml/docbook/utils-0.6.9/docbook-utils.dsl
 -i print -o foo.rtf Documentation/DocBook/writing_usb_driver.sgml 
Anyone have ideas?
