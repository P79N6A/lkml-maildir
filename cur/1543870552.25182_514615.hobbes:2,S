I miss-spoke above now that I read it again, sorry Con.  I think I thought 
my fingers had put 'Comparing' in front of the 'Using' above. This time 
of the night, my mind has been known to be running a chapter or more 
ahead of (or in some cases behind) my fingers.
2.6.20-ck1 runs great, 2.6.21-rc2 was not only a dog, it fed amanda a 
bunch of lsd via bad data from tar, so tar when told to do a level 1 
while 21-rc2 (without your patch) was running, it actually did a level 0, 
and predictably ran out of vtape.  /usr/pix didn't change over 7GB of its 
contents overnight, in fact nothing changed there yesterday, but tar sure 
went on a rampage.
Sorry about the confusion.  I'm back in 2.6.20-ck1 and everythings cool.
