I am pretty sure that Linus will not want to be copied on all these emails.
The result is likely to be that he reads none of them.
I don't think that at this stage we should be talking to Linus Torvalds at
all. He is probably too busy.
I think that a much better approach would be to talk to the current kernel
oss sound developers, and get alsa checked into the kernel via them.
I think that one person should be responsible for linux kernel sound, so
that Linus Torvalds does not have to ignore so much email due to overload.
When I have too many emails in my email box, single short(5 lines) emails
get read, whole discussion threads get left unread.
So a simple "Here is the final alsa sound patch for the kernel" from someone
Linus already knows would in my view be more successful.
My 2 cents.
James
