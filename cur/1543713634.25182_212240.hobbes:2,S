Subject: [PATCH] SAA5246A Teletext driver also works with SAA5281

Hello,
the SAA5246A Teletext processor driver also works for the
SAA5281 (I am the author of this driver).
This is not surprising because according to the data sheet of 
the SAA5281 it is compatible to the SAA5246A. But now I have 
tested this with a Siemens Multimedia Extension Board (MXB).
The following patch only changes comments in 
/drivers/media/video/Kconfig and in the sources of the driver.
I also added MODULE_AUTHOR and MODULE_DESCRIPTION macros which
were missing up to now.
Michael
