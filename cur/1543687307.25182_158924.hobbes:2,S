I experimented with HPET in native APIC routing mode. But, there 
are couple of issues in that space:
1) During boot up kernel expects to receive timer interrupt much before
the 
IO-APIC initialization is done. If HPET uses native mode, it cannot
generate 
timer interrupts till IOAPICs are initialized. So, we need to have some
sort of 
Workarounds in generic kernel to avoid dependency on timer interrupt
during the 
early boot.
2) More important question is, do we really want to share timer
interrupt with 
other PCI devices? This potentially can add some delay in the timer
interrupt 
processing, and thus we may end up getting inaccurate time (and
inaccurate 
timer interrupts) in the kernel.
Thanks,
