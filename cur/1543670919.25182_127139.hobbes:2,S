Ok, if I do that, and that was what I originally did, then we end up
with:
	struct device_class;
	struct device_class_device;
	struct device_class_interface;
Um, I don't think "struct device_class_device" is going to be
acceptable...
So I talked to a lot of people, explaining what the structures were, and
what they did, and in the end everyone agreed that dropping the
beginning "device_" is probably the best.
Well, not everyone agreed, but they couldn't come up with a better name,
so I took that as agreement :)

In a way, it is generic.  It doesn't have to refer to a device (if the
pointer to struct device is NULL, then you don't get the "device"
symlink for free, that's it.)  So we can now move block "devices", which
includes partitions, into this model, and also network "devices" if we
want too.  Oh, how about filesystems, they also fit nicely into this
model, and aren't really a "device" at all...

I know, I'm a stinker, but I honestly couldn't think of a better name,
and am open to ideas from everyone else.
And, I like the way my editor highlights the code, "struct class"...
