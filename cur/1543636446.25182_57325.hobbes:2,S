So after you checked for users, someone starts using the module again,
before you were able to remove all interfaces -> OOPS.
This is exactly the reason why I prefer to make this explicit in the
module interface - the chances are higher to get this right.

It has to work around the problem that cleanup_module() can't fail.

It's currently impossible to force the unloading of a module, some user
can always keep a reference to the module. Even if you kill the process,
someone else can get a new reference, before you could unload the module.

I don't disagree, but if we break the module interface anyway, why don't
we clean it up properly?
(Patches that do that will follow shortly.)

That's broken (see above).
