I've seen this kind of lockups with an IBM ThinkPad 600X. The problem
was that it has a broken BIOS e820 memory detection, so Linux took
the complete 192MB available. Unfortunately, the ACPI tables lived in
the last megabyte of memory, so as soon as the system got an ACPI
event, it locked. We solved it by using "mem=191M" on the command line
(instead of using all 192 MB).
