Aren't you arguing my side here? My point is that what I'm trying to
add with "containers" (or whatever name we end up using) can't easily
be subsumed into the "namespace" concept, and you're arguing that they
should go into nsproxy because they share some characteristics.

Uh, no. I'm trying to call a *grouping* of processes a container.
