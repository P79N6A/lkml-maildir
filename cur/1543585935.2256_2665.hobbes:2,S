Hello,
ISSUE: very slow (factor 100) 4-way 16GByte server, with 2.4.2
DESCR: we have a Maxdata 4-way Xeon, with 16GByte RAM. If we compile a kernel (2.4.0 or 2.4.2 up to ac25) that uses all 16 GByte RAM the machine gets very slow. For example network Bandwidth of 100MBit Ethernet is about 1-50kByte/sec.  Access to harddrives seems to be equally slow.
	I really do not know where to start looking, but I know that lots of people seem to be using n-way Xeon with 16+GByte RAM without severe performance problem.
KEYWORDS: kernel, slow, maxdata, 16GB
KERNEL: 2.4.0 and 2.4.2 (upto ac25)
If more information --- like /proc/cpuinfo or uname -a or versions of installed software ... --- is needed to analyse the problem, please tell me, I will gladly send it.
Sincerely,
	Robert S.
