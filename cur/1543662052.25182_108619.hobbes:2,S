May I ask, how many bits do you consider available? swsusp beta 18 (ie
2.4), which I'm beginning to port to 2.5, uses 4 bits during suspend &
resume for various purposes. If I understand the code correctly, the
zone flags use bits 24-31 (although there has been that thread saying
they could use less bits). I see in the 2.5.60 patch bit 19 is now in
use. Should I be using private, temporarily allocated bitmaps instead of
the page flags, to ease the pressure? (Especially since the suspend code
is not used in 'normal' operation anyway).
Regards,
Nigel
