The point to freezing tasks isn't just to stop drivers doing work. It's also 
to stop userspace doing work and thereby increase reliability. The more work 
that is occuring while we're trying to write a hibernation image, the less 
reliable the hibernation will be (competing for memory and so on) and the 
slower it will be (competing for cycles etc).

You can say it "imposes certain ordering" but you can say what that ordering 
is?! How about mount order? That must be a good start.
