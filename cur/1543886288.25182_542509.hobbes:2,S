Sounds good - though I'm a tad lazy, and don't know how to contribute
this to the LTP.
You're welcome to contribute it yourself, if that's easier for you,
or to point me in the direction of some information on this.
Since it's GPL, you can republish it, under that license.
... Most likely however, it will take a little tweaking to make this
test work well for LTP.  Most automated test environments have some
requirements on the behaviour of each test, and it would be surprising
if this test happen already to conform to LTP's requirements.
