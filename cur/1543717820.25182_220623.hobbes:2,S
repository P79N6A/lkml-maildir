The following snippet is from drivers/video/riva/fbdev.c  I'm put arrows 
on the lines I think break cursor loading.  It does segfault, but boy 
does the cursor look weird.  The code in this function is so confusing, 
I have no idea what was going on or how to fix it:
/**
 * rivafb_load_cursor_image - load cursor image to hardware
 * @data: address to monochrome bitmap (1 = foreground color, 0 = 
background)
 * @par:  pointer to private data
 * @w:    width of cursor image in pixels
 * @h:    height of cursor image in scanlines
 * @bg:   background color (ARGB1555) - alpha bit determines opacity
 * @fg:   foreground color (ARGB1555)
 *
 * DESCRIPTiON:
 * Loads cursor image based on a monochrome source and mask bitmap.  The
 * image bits determines the color of the pixel, 0 for background, 1 for
 * foreground.  Only the affected region (as determined by @w and @h
 * parameters) will be updated.
 *
 * CALLED FROM:
 * rivafb_cursor()
 */
static void rivafb_load_cursor_image(struct riva_par *par, u8 *data,
                                     u8 *mask, u16 bg, u16 fg, u32 w, u32 h)
{
        int i, j, k = 0;
        u32 b, m, tmp;
        for (i = 0; i < h; i++) {
->             b = *((u32 *)data);
                b = (u32)((u32 *)b + 1);
->              m = *((u32 *)mask);
                m = (u32)((u32 *)m + 1);
                reverse_order(&b);
