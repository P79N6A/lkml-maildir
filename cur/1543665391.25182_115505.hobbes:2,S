Hi Bryan,
What serial driver initialization messages do you get from dmesg?
Is the "MANY_PORTS" flag present in the list of enabled options?
Which distribution and rev level are you using?
Ed

BTW, this is with 2.4.19 (kernel shipped with distro).... I'm willing to 
test any patches / rebuild kernel to get this working.....
