I can confirm that the same thing happens on powerpc, both 32-bit and
64-bit.  The compiler loads up jiffies, jiffies_64 and wall_jiffies
into registers before storing back the incremented value into
jiffies_64 and then updating wall_jiffies.
Thanks for finding that, it explains some other strange things that I
have seen happen.
Paul.
