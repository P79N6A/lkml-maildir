Here is where this thing falls down.  Some time ago I put together a tick less 
system (which is what this amounts to).  The patch is still on sourceforge (see 
the HRT URL in my signature).  The problem is this:
On context switch the scheduler needs to figure the minimum time to the next 
event for the new task.  This would be the minimum of the remaining slice, 
profile timer, virtual time, and the cpu limit timer (at least).  It would then 
do an add_timer for this time.  On the next context switch it would, most 
likely, cancel the timer (most code does not run to the end of its slice which 
is the most likely limit).  The computation to find the minimum time, with a bit 
of hand waving, could be shortened to eliminate a few of the timers. On switch 
out, all the tasks timers would need to be updated with the actual time the task 
used.  The problem is that all this work is in the VERY lean and mean context 
switch path.  In my tests a context switching could easily occur often enough 
that the savings from not doing the tick interrupts was over whelmed by the 
added context switch over head with a medium cpu load.  And it is down hill from 
here.  I.e. the tick less system incurres accounting overhead in  direct 
proportion to the number of context switches, while the ticking system has a 
fixed accounting overhead.  AND the cross over point (where the tick less system 
overhead is more that the ticked system overhead) occurs with a medium load.
