I think I was misunderstood.
Have you reviewed the PCI IDE specification?
On modern chipsets, the IDE device appears in PCI -- but often, the first 
four I/O ports will be zeroed out, indicating that the I/O regions are
actually 0x1f0/0x170.
For example:
00:1f.1 IDE interface: Intel Corporation 82801EB/ER (ICH5/ICH5R) IDE Controller 
(rev 02) (prog-if 8a [Master SecP PriP])
        Subsystem: Hewlett-Packard Company d530 CMT (DG746A)
        Control: I/O+ Mem+ BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop- ParErr- Step
ping- SERR- FastB2B-
        Status: Cap- 66Mhz- UDF- FastB2B+ ParErr- DEVSEL=medium >TAbort- <TAbort
- <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR-
        Latency: 0
        Interrupt: pin A routed to IRQ 169
        Region 0: I/O ports at <ignored>
        Region 1: I/O ports at <ignored>
        Region 2: I/O ports at <ignored>
        Region 3: I/O ports at <ignored>
        Region 4: I/O ports at 14c0 [size=16]
        Region 5: Memory at 40000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=1K]
Trust me, IDE on PCI is still quite weird.
