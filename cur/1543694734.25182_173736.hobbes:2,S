Subject: [PATCH] Fix drivers/ide/pci/siimage.c for PROC_FS=n
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Greetings Bartlomiej,
I'm sending this patch to you as the IDE maintainer; please let me know if one
of the authors of the driver in question should take it instead.
The Silicon Image SATA driver is not building properly when CONFIG_PROC_FS is
unset.  This patch corrects that problem.  It appears as though several utility
functions at the top of drivers/ide/pci/siimage.c that the driver always needs
accidentally fell within an #ifdef CONFIG_PROC_FS.  I also removed an excess
include while I noticed it.
The patch applies to linux-2.5 BK as of 0400 UTC 10/20/2003.  I successfully
compiled the driver without PROC_FS and also did a successful allyesconfig build
on i386 with this change applied.  Since I do not have this hardware, I could
not test the driver in operation, but I think the change is straightforward.
Thanks,
Noah

# Make several functions in drivers/ide/pci/siimage.c compile regardless
# of CONFIG_PROC_FS.  They are generally applicable, and leaving them out
# prevents building the driver without CONFIG_PROC_FS.
