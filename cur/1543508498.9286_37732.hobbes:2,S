Horst,
Nowadays you get "designed for windows95" or even "requires win95" on
virtually everything, which I think should be present only on 
garbage bins so your observation of what they call "minimum system
requirements" is not enough to satisfy me.
The only way forward is to actually look at the beast which I was too
tired to do yesterday but intend to do today. That will destroy all the
doubts and mist surrounding the issue.
Also, I have strong suspicion that 5610 and 5690 PCI models are *not*
winmodems, they are just unsupported PCI devices which use mapped memory
to communicate with the host.
Regards,
Tigran.
