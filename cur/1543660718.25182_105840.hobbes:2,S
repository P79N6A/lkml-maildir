I had never realized this; things are symmetric in an odd way with NFS,
and this bit with locking can trick you. I've changed the clients to
mount private nfs directories (the perks of shared root for diskless ;)
and I do hope things will work out from now on.
One thing worth noting is that the private /var/lib/nfs directory has to
be mounted a) with nolock (I assume) and b) *before* statd and lockd
have gone up.

I am now left wondering how it bit us so little here. Is there a way of
finding out exactly *which* files are being locked at a certain time for
a certain client? 
Take care,
