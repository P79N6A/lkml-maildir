That's not a bad idea, I'll do it.

Yes I considered that, but daddr_t is exported to userland by the tape
ioctls, and is defined to be 32-bit, so it'd require out-of-kernel changes.
Besides, Jens had introduced sector_t for the purpose of counting
blocks and sectors, so I thought I may as well use it.  One could
argue that it's misnamed (personally, I liked Ben's `blkoff_t' for
offset in blocks), but it's been thare for four months or so, and was
already being used in likely places throughout the block layer.  I
just extended its use to all the places I thought were necessary
(there may be some paths that I've missed; but I hope not).

For filesystems that *can* handle logical filesystem blocks beyond the
2^32 limit (i.e., that use >32bit offsets in their on-disc format),
the get_block() argument has to be > 32bits long.  At  the moment
that's only JFS and XFS, but reiserfs version 4 looks as if it might
go that way.  We'll need this especially when the pagecache limit is
gone.
Besides, blocksize is not usually pagesize.  ext[23] uses 1k or 4k
blocks depending on the size and expected use of the filesystem; alpha
pagesize is usually 8k, for example.  The arm uses 4k, 16k or 32k
pagesizes depending on the model.
So on 32-bit systems, ulong is not enough.  (in fact if you look at
jfs, the first thing jfs_get_block does is convert the block number
arg to a 64-bit number).
