Well, I cannot finish printing anything now and I believe, that one of
above is responsible. 
It looks as if printer gets some amount of data but then communication 
'stops' and printer waits for more data (usually I have about 2cm 
of page printed, paper locked and later printer error leds start
blinking happily :)
Not sure, if it's directly related, but system seems to be less 
responsive later.
Version of usblp.c from 2.6.0-test2 compiled with 2.6.0-test3 does
not work as I expected (I can load module, but printer is not 
detected - no usual 'usblp0: USB Unidirectional printer dev 3 if 0 alt 1
proto 2 vid 0x03F0 pid' message in logs).
I traced my problem down to -test2-bk2 (with bk1 everything works
correctly).
o Printer is connected to /dev/usb/lp0; it's HP840c
o ver_linux output: 
http://zeus.polsl.gliwice.pl/kernel/2.6.0-test3/ver_linux
o config: 
http://zeus.polsl.gliwice.pl/kernel/2.6.0-test3/config
o dmesg: 
http://zeus.polsl.gliwice.pl/kernel/2.6.0-test3/dmesg
o /proc/bus/usb/devices: 
http://zeus.polsl.gliwice.pl/kernel/2.6.0-test3/devices
o some related logs: 
http://zeus.polsl.gliwice.pl/kernel/2.6.0-test3/logs
Any suggestions are welcome :)
