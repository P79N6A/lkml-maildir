Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly... I'm using lilo, and at the
prompt, I use:
linux lp=0
I wasn't sure if I was supposed to use quotes or not, though I believe
not.  When I do it this way on soft reboot, the kernel dies *before* it
echoes the message about polling, as opposed to *after* as it was without
the option.  However, when I do the hard reboot (and use lp=0) it boots
fine, but printing no longer works and the printer doesn't do its normal
initialization.
