cool! By the way, could you try a test-compile with a 'big' .config file?
The reason i'm asking this is that with 31 seconds compiles, the final
link time serialization has a significant effect, which makes the compile
itself less scalable. Adding lots of subsystems to the .config will create
a compilation that takes much longer, but which should also compare the
two schedulers better.
