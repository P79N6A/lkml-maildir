 The multiplier here is not PAGE_SIZE, but [PAGE_SIZE / (8 * 
THREAD_SIZE)], and this value is expected to be rather small (2, 4, or 
so).
 Furthermore, due to the #if/#endif construction multiplication is 
used only with rather big PAGE_SIZE values, and the bigger page size 
is then the smaller 'mempages' is.
 So, for example, when running with PAGE_SIZE=256KB, THREAD_SIZE=8KB, 
on 32-bit 440spe-based machine with 4GB RAM installed, here we have:
 max_threads = (4G/256K) * (256K / 8 * 8K) = 16384 * 4 = 65536.
 And the overflow will have a place only in case of very very big 
sizes of RAM: >= 256TB:
 max_threads = (256T / 256K) * (256K / 8 * 8K) = 0x4000.0000 * 4.
 But I don't think that with 256TB RAM installed this code will be 
the only place of problems :)
