Just in case you guys didn't hear, Linux Networx won best in show for
the Servers, Storage, and Peripherals category running Ute-Linux with
the M2FS file system on a Linux Networx 1240 Evolocity Cluster Server
with 20 clustered processor nodes at NetWorld+Interop in Atlanta this
week.  Windows 2000 did not even get mentions this year in any category
....
