Sure, works for me. I just had written it and didn't want to keep it
from the world after changing my mind about needing it.

Just made the API a bit quirky, maybe just support both ways of using
things? Would only need a flag somewhere in the btree structure, I'd
think; ultimately it doesn't matter much to me though.

I don't think I've understood this yet. That code above there is a
backwards walk over the key space, and it's safe to call
btree_remove(key) at /* do something with key */?

Cool, thanks. Mainly making it a module for testing anyway.
