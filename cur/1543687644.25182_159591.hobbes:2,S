If it's just a naming issue for you, then yes, we could change the current 
EXPERIMENTAL/BROKEN/EMBEDDED questions around a bit.
So we could split the EMBEDDED question into "STANDARD" (which implies VT,
INPUT layer, PS/2 ATKBD) and "FEATURECOMPLETE" (FUTEX, EPOLL, NET).
Is it worth it? I see EMBEDDED as more of a "STANDARD" thing - for people
who don't care or know, that's a slight safety-net saying "this selects
the things you take for grated".
