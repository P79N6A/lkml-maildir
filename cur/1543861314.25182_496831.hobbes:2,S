reiser4-sb_sync_inodes.patch causes my system to lock hard (no alt-sysrq,
need to power cycle) *very* early in the boot - earlyprintk hasn't fired
up yet, I don't get penguins, *nada*. I'm guessing it's something to do with
the changed spinlocking from the -rc2-mm1 version.
Kernel boots OK with that one patch reverted.
