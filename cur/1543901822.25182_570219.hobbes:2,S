Oooh!  That's nice!  I didn't notice the "nicely split up" part earlier.
Any chance we can get the original docbook inputs that OLS uses
for paper submissions?  Have you asked Andrew or Craig about this?
Also, it would be nice to correlate the talk names with the individual
PDFs.  Do you want me to solicit inside CELF for a volunteer for this?
We'd probably produce a wiki page of links, based on your
list.txt file and the proceedings index.
