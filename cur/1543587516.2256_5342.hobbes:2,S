I found (at least part of) the problem.  In detach_timer() we test if
the timer is pending.  If it is not the function does not remove the
timer from the list and returns 0.  The functions that call
detach_timer() do not check the return value and unconditionally set the
list pointers to NULL, even though the timer is still on the list. 
Patch against 2.4.3 attached, but there may be a better solution.
