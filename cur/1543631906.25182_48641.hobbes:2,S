CFLAGS is initially defined with ':=', which, as opposed to '=' means to 
evaluate directly and store the resulting string, so it should be fine. 
Even if it wasn't, only the evaluations from the top-level Makefile would
cause the command to be executed, make will always pass down the evaluated 
result to the subdir makes.
