Isn't the "current" RTL8169s (32/64) driver much outdated?
I got a version # 1.6 with all my cards.
Anyone what a copy?
/*
=========================================================================
 r8169.c: A RealTek RTL8169s/8110s Gigabit Ethernet driver for Linux kernel 
2.4.x.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 History:
 Feb  4 2002	- created initially by ShuChen <shuchen@realtek.com.tw>.
 May 20 2002	- Add link status force-mode and TBI mode support.
=========================================================================
  1. The media can be forced in 5 modes.
	 Command: 'insmod r8169 media = SET_MEDIA'
	 Ex:	  'insmod r8169 media = 0x04' will force PHY to operate in 100Mpbs 
Half-duplex.
	 SET_MEDIA can be:
 		_10_Half	= 0x01
 		_10_Full	= 0x02
 		_100_Half	= 0x04
 		_100_Full	= 0x08
 		_1000_Full	= 0x10
  2. Support TBI mode.
//=========================================================================
RTL8169_VERSION "1.1"	<2002/10/4>
	The bit4:0 of MII register 4 is called "selector field", and have to be
	00001b to indicate support of IEEE std 802.3 during NWay process of
	exchanging Link Code Word (FLP).
RTL8169_VERSION "1.2"	<2003/6/17>
	Update driver module name.
	Modify ISR.
        Add chip mac_version.
RTL8169_VERSION "1.3"	<2003/6/20>
        Add chip phy_version.
	Add priv->phy_timer_t, rtl8169_phy_timer_t_handler()
	Add rtl8169_hw_PHY_config()
	Add rtl8169_hw_PHY_reset()
RTL8169_VERSION "1.4"	<2003/7/14>
	Add tx_bytes, rx_bytes.
RTL8169_VERSION "1.5"	<2003/7/18>
	Set 0x0000 to PHY at offset 0x0b.
	Modify chip mac_version, phy_version
	Force media for multiple card.
RTL8169_VERSION "1.6"	<2003/8/25>
	Modify receive data buffer.
