Hi Richard,
I didn't get an answer regarding the following mail sent one year ago:
----- Forwarded message from Adrian Bunk <bunk@fs.tum.de> -----
Date:	Mon, 14 Jul 2003 00:43:30 +0200

Cc: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
Subject: Remove CONFIG_H8 in 2.5?
CONFIG_H8 in drivers/char/ depend in both 2.4 and 2.5 on 
CONFIG_OBSOLETE.
 
Since CONFIG_OBSOLETE is never set it is not selectable.
Is there any reason why this driver should stay in the kernel or would
you accept a patch that removes this driver?
cu
Adrian
----- End forwarded message -----
Since this issue is still present in current 2.6 kernels, I'd suggest 
the following:
rm drivers/char/h8.c
rm drivers/char/h8.h
