hi-
 I have a masquerading gateway that I'm trying to switch from RH 5.2
(2.0.36). 
 Everything is fine except the demand-dialing, which worked fine on
2.0.36 is being killed by ppp ioctl that now reports an error when
trying to assign the 'external' address set for the demand dialing's
default route.
 the key ppp options:
   0.0.0.0:198.247.1.62
   ipcp-accept-local
   ipcp-accept-remote
   noipdefault
 the syslog message is:
   pppd[496]: ioctl(SIOCSIFDSTADDR): Cannot assign requested address(99)
 The (outside) 198.x.x.x remote address is required for demand dialing,
yet the ppp ioctl won't allow it any more- thus I'm locked out.
 What are the rest of you using for demand-dial ppp?  my setup worked
fine for 2.0.x, and should be Ok for 2.2.x .
 I'm using 2.2.4-ac1 (but have also tried 2.2.3 versions also) with a
pcmcia modem.
