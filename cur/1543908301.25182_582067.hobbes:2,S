I'm not a fan of this trend of sticking device specific headers in
include/linux, but if it's for registers common to many devices spread
all over the kernel tree, then I suppose it's acceptable.
I'm not going to apply this just yet though as it isn't used. Include
it with the first driver that needs it.
