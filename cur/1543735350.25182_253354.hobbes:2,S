Subject: [patch] softirqs: fix latency of softirq processing
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/9/17/105

the attached patch fixes a local_bh_enable() buglet: we first enabled
softirqs then did we do local_softirq_pending() - often this is
preemptible code. So this task could be preempted and there's no
guarantee that softirq processing will occur (except the periodic timer
tick).
the race window is small but existent. This could result in packet
processing latencies or timer expiration latencies - hard to detect and
annoying bugs.
the fix is to invoke softirqs with softirqs enabled but preemption still
disabled. Patch is against 2.6.9-rc2-mm1.
