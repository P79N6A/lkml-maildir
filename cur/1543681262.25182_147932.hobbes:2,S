good good..

That's a possibility, but if that were the case, I'd expect other things
also to start randomly failing. It's unclear to me how -O2 would make
a hardware bug more aparent. If it did so, that would also mean you'd
have to ensure all your userspace was similarly compiled, which sounds
very suspect.  It's just a celeron based PC with nvidia nforce chipset right ?
If that combination caused such problems, I'd expect to see the
occasional problem report from non-Xbox regular home-built PC users too.
Might be one worth picking over on the gcc lists if you can identify
which part gets miscompiled ?
Tried different versions of binutils too ?
