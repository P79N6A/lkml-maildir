Well, under normal operation this test will never be true (same as the
other tests there), but it appears that in some cases there _are_ values
of "block + count" which pass this test but fail later on.  I don't know
the exact source of the problem, but it appears to happen when "block"
is -1, and "block + count" is then 0, which does not trigger the
existing tests (s_first_data_block is 0 for 4kB filesystems).
It is likely that block is being set as -EPERM or something like that,
but I'm not sure.  In any case, you can check l-k archives for the
original emails on this thread where the users report trying to access
group 131071, which is 2^32 / 32768 (i.e. -1 / number of blocks per
group for a 4kB block ext2 filesystem).
Cheers, Andreas
