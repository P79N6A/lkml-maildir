I understand that point - but the basic question is if you schedule
based on the process or based on the thread.  In an interactive multi-
user system, you may even want to back out to the user level.  (Thus
no user can hog the system by doing many things).  But that is usually
not the target of Linux systems (yet?)
The problem then is the inter-process communications.  (At least on
that system - Linux has many better solutions)  That system did not
have shared memory and thus the coordination between processes was
difficult at best.

And they exist - but the I/O overhead makes it "not a win" on a
single machine.  (It hurts too much)
