I'm having trouble with cramfs in a 2.4.9 kernel with PAGE_CACHE_SIZE == 8192.
cramfs tries to read beyond the size of my block device.
I think I've found the problem: in the function cramfs_read in fs/cramfs/inode.c
the line
	devsize = blk_size[major][minor] >> 2;
seems to assume a block size of 4096 bytes. Shouldn't it be depending on
PAGE_CACHE_SIZE or the block size of the filesystem? The following works
for me:
	devsize = blk_size[major][minor] / (PAGE_CACHE_SIZE / 1024);
Best regards
/Jonas
