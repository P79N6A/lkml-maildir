You just remind me that I had to comment out the request_region in another
watchdog driver I wrote, because the hardware was mapped on I/O port 0xF2
which is within the FPU I/O space :
   00f0-00ff : fpu
I did not know how to correctly fix this problem, and I could live without
the check, but I found it dirty and never proposed it for inclusion.
It's not the first time I notice that write-only hardware share a reserved
I/O range with other components, and I don't know how to cope with this.
Perhaps it sounds logical not to request_region() as the hardware is meant
to be 100% transparent afterall ?
