I think currently, it's only the people running the -test or -devel Fedora
trees that can get bit - Fedora Core 1 didn't have it, as it was still a
2.4 kernel, and Fedora Core 2 just kicked over from FC 1.92 last night..
And then they'd have to have NVidia cards, and use the NVIdia drivers..
and I suspect that most of the people who are in that group visit either
one of the NVidia forums or www.minion.de, both of which have lots
of tags saying that patch needs reverting...
So right now it's probably NOT biting too many, as only the clueful are
getting into a situation where it's a problem.
Wait a week or two, when .ISO's of FC2 hit the streets. :)
