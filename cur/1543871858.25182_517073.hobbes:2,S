There should be no difference between compile time and runtime
disabling.

Can you capture a boot log with highres and/or dynticks enabled ? 
Enable CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_CONSOLE and add "console=ttyS0,115200" to the
commandline. Capture the output with minicom on a second box.
Also please enable CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ and try to send a SysRq-T and a
SysRq-Q to the machine via keyboard or the serial line.
Thanks
