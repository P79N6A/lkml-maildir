As stated in a later post, a basic versioning could be implemented 
where a ".1" or similar could be added to the end of the file.  This
could definitely cause problems with the disk filling up though (see
below).

A special binary could be created that would be able to read the
contents of the .undelete directory based on the uid of the user running
it.  The binary could remove the file if desired.  The user space
implementation would require more thought, but there are several
possibilities that I can think of.

This is a good point.  The kernel space code could just filter out
anything being removed from /tmp (and the various .undelete
directories).  But there would be other files.  A low priorotiy cron job
or daemon could remedy the others (being configurable in user space). 
it could also remove files with a high version number if space was low.

I am not sure what this is referencing.  I was now thinking that a
kernel compile option (CONFIG_UNDELETE) could be used for those who
wanted this, and those that didn't could leave it out.  And for those
that do, but only on some mountpoints, the sysadmin could simply have
the .undelete just on those mounts that needed the undelete feature. 
The kernel code would simply remove the file like normal if the
.undelete directory was not present.

I REALLY doubt it! :-)  But it is fun getting into the kernel code and
trying some stuff out.

Valid points which leads me to think that a special suid/sgid user space
program would be needed.  The .undelete directory would have chmod 700
owned by root (or possibly 770 with 'chown root.undelete' ownership).
