This has been discussed a number of times before, and hasn't been accepted. I 
don't remember why - I know many people objected to the kernel bloat, and I 
note that your patch doesn't make it a config option.
I presume that the previous implementations shared the same problem. If it were
a config option, I can't see any reason for objecting to it - it's tiny and 
unobtrusive.
