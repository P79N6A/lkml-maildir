We're getting close to 2.6.9, aka the first release with official m32r
support.  So could you please remove the obsolete syscalls from the
default config so we don't have to support them forever?
Also there's still arch/m32r/drivers, and it adds new MOD_INC_USE_COUNT
users - but that one has been completely removed in -mm already
