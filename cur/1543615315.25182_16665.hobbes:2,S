This is C. If you use ``strcpy'', an identifier reserved by the
standard, it means that you want to move some bytes from here to there
and please let the compiler decide how to do that.  Much in the same
way as when you assign structures and compiler uses ``memcpy'' or
maybe it doesn't if it wouldn't be a win.

Where do you see changes in pointer arithmetic ? Or in the "memory
model" (whatever that means) ?
I'd dare to state that _very_ few people would join the quest for
writing the kernel in something other than C.
