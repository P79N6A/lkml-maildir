I've applied this and fixed the build issue (again with the
drivers/usb/Makefile file) and the Kconfig entries don't need to be
duplicated so many times :)
Also, I've fixed up the sparse warnings, but you are doing something
very wierd with the user buffer still, and I get these warnings:
drivers/usb/misc/ftdi-elan.c:1231:65: warning: dereference of noderef expression
drivers/usb/misc/ftdi-elan.c:1237:65: warning: dereference of noderef expression
with sparse still.  I think it's a bunch of debug code that is remaining
in that function, care to send me a follow-on patch that removes it?
thanks,
