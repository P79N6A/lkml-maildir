I have no problem with it. VR is apart of the mips developement we are
doing. Also we do alot of IT 8172 and au1000 devleopement as well. Plus
some early work for the cobalt cube is being done. I will finish the cube 
now that we have a pretty generic pci code layer that is shared amoung
many boards.
