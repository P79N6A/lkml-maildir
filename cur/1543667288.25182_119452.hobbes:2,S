ptrace has always explicitly allowed a process with the CAP_SYS_PTRACE
capability to ptrace a task which isn't dumpable.  With the ptrace "fix"
in place, you can attach to a non-dumpable thread:
int ptrace_attach(struct task_struct *task)
{
	...
-       if (!task->mm->dumpable && !capable(CAP_SYS_PTRACE))
+       if (!is_dumpable(task) && !capable(CAP_SYS_PTRACE))
                goto bad;
}
but you can't do anything with it (not even detach from it):
int ptrace_check_attach(struct task_struct *child, int kill)
{
	...
+       if (!is_dumpable(child))
+               return -EPERM;
}
So, we went from being able to ptrace daemons as root, to being able to
attach daemons and then being unable to do anything with them, even if
you're root (or have the CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability).  I think this
behaviour is getting on for being described as "insane" 8) and is
clearly wrong.
Note that processes become "undumpable" as soon as they starts playing
with its [GU]IDs (via setre[gu]id, set[gu]id, set_res[gu]id, setfs[ug]id.)
