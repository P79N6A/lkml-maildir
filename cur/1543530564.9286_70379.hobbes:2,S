Subject: Adaptec SCSI adapter incorrectly identified

I recently replaced my Adaptec 2940UW with a "Pro" model of the same card.
/proc/scsi/aix7xxx/0 now reports this card incorrectly as a 2944 (the
differential model).
I am running the stock kernel shipped with 'Drake 6.1, 2.2.13pre4 as I
recall. Adaptec driver rev 5.1.19/3.2.4.
Is this normal, or was it a bug fixed in a later scsi driver rev?
If anyone wishes to respond, please do so directly to my email address as
I will not be watching the vger lists for the next week or so.
