Yup there is definitely something not right:
rlrevell@mindpipe:~/cvs/wakeup$ ./rt_wakeup 1024 100000
freq: 1024 #: 100000
setting up /dev/rtc.
locking memory...
turning irq on, beginning measurement (might take a while).
done.
total # of irqs: 100065. missed irq's: 4
mean cycle difference betweem two wakeups: 586332 cycles
min. cycle difference betweem two wakeups: 25184 cycles (#: 28766)
 diff from mean diff: 561148
max. cycle difference betweem two wakeups: 2.78432e+07 cycles (#: 98195)
 diff from mean diff: 2.72569e+07
mean difference from mean difference: 3759.45 cycles
You should modify the program to print something when it sees a big
miss.  This would make it easier to figure out what kind of system
activity triggers the problem.
