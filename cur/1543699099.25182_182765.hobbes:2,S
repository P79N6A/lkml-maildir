Do you have CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO enabled? Try turning it off.
I have not tried to compile with it on but there were other complaints
about larger *kernel* images, and the config help (arch/i386/Kconfig)
says:
config DEBUG_INFO
        bool "Compile the kernel with debug info"
        depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
        help
          If you say Y here the resulting kernel image will include
          debugging info resulting in a larger kernel image.
          Say Y here only if you plan to use gdb to debug the kernel.
          If you don't debug the kernel, you can say N.
