Well, aside that RFC's are comment requests and not standards...
They become accepted or not as time goes by -- they also become
obsolete.
CISCO does support CIDR routing, you just need to turn on the
classless option -- by default they fall back on old habits.  And
I know from a friend of mine that bay routers can be made to do
classless routing in recent days.
Also, most ISP's and such do classless routing.  Some places only
need an a.b.c.d/28 or some such for their small network, and with
IP addresses having become such a commodity it was only prudent.
This goes ditto for those places that have a firewall/proxy and all
their internal address are in the 192.168.0.0/16, since they now
need P-t-P routing on an interface between them and a provider, everything 
else on the class subnet goes default or somewhere else.  I could
repeat myself for VLANs.
The short of it is, is that CIDR routing is pretty much the accepted
way of doing networking these days (note, that stands for Classless Internet 
Domain Routing, which implies that paying attention to classes while doing
CIDR routing makes very little sense).  The classful stuff is tending 
to be supported mostly because of the necessity of supporting old networks 
and methods.
