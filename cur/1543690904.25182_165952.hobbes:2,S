The problem is that the kernel has many copyright holders for different
parts of the code, so what the author of module.h wrote can well be
his own opinion but not that of others. Also, if modules are derived
works under the terms of the GPL, the header file cannot change that
fact, no matter what is says exactly.
Once again, it's all up to the lawyers to decide.
