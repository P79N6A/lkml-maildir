Let me restate the fact, if it wasn't obvious enough, that most people
who tried RSDL (and most of them use desktop systems, me including) never
see any regressions compared to mainline. Quite contrary -- their impressions
were that with RSDL desktop system runs more smoothly, even under fierce load,
which was never possible with mainline scheduler.
