But we would not open the semaphore on malloc() but instead in
the init functions of the libc. So the semaphore will be already
allocated. May be dup2()ed to some very high range
(INT_MAX-__GLIBC_MALLOC_SEM_FD) and the original fd closed.
So this will be no real problem. That's why I don't like lazy
init: May be you cannot init anymore, if you come to and
condition, where you would need it.
Also init/fini are usally very slow operations and as many things
as possible are burdend onto their shoulders.
Semaphores tend to be structures living very long (at least in
all code I've written and seen so far) so I see no point in
defering their initialization.
