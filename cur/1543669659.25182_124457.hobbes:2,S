You can store the default permissions in the database you use to store
the naming data.  This solves the reboot problem, as long as you can
convince people to not modify the permissions on their own (well even if
they do, at shutdown, you can always validate that they are the same
before you clean up the node.)
And provide an easy way for users to change the permissions so they show
up in the database.
devchmod and devchown anyone?  :)
thanks,
