Well yes.  People who merge via -mm continue to be at a disadvantage
because they're forced to go behind all the subsystem trees.  Plus I (and
apparently I alone) will skip patches when the kernel is
more-than-usually-wrecked and will slow things down for stabilisation as
we're heading into the merge window.
Plus: I started to prepare 2.6.24-mm1 on Friday morning, worked all weekend
and got it out Sunday evening after having committed forty to fifty fixes
and having dropped numerous patches.
If this situation (conflicting changes and poor code quality) persists into
the 2.6.25 cycle I will toss all the subsystem trees out of -mm, shall
rebase -mm on mainline and shall merge first.  I had decided today to
actually just do this, but on reflection I'll give it just one more shot.
It's remarkable how many bugs are in current mainline which weren't in
2.6.24-rc8-mm1.  What could have caused this?

yes, against 2.6.24-mm1 would be good, thanks.  I really don't know what
went wrong in i386 but I ended up getting all grumpy at the macro mess
we've made in all the pagetable handling.  Please do take a look at
improving that.
