Yes, it could get challenging, but it's very desirable to do the
optimization somehow.  It's even more desirable to stay focussed on
the immediate issues, imho.
Food for thought: readdir actually picks up the entries 4K-worth at a
time, however that's randomly aligned with respect to directory block
boundaries, meaning that most blocks get two hits, which could well be
the problem.
Inode table blocks present a more difficult problem.  It's really hard
to know when to evict them, and just arbitrarily holding them to a
certain percentage of memory isn't nice either.
I think Andrew also mentioned he sees a lot of buffers sitting around
in the morning.  His strip-buffers-immediately hack would kill that
one dead.
