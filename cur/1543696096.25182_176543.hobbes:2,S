Subject: 2.6.0-test9 and X11: box dies when I switch to VT

	Hello all,
I can't really remember when this happened (probably after test 6 or 7) but
now, using plain vanilla 2.6.0-test9, I can't switch to the console after
XFree has been started. If I do, I get a login prompt but all the input
devices are disabled (keyboard/mouse).
At this point, the box is frozen and doesn't respond to pings (Magic SysRq
doesn't work either). Note that switching still works if I reboot and use a
different kernel.
I've tried enabling all the debug options to get a call trace using a
serial console but that was unsucessful. A shutdown/reboot produces the
same thing, XFree exits, I get the "Switching to runlevel" message and
that's it...
I'm not running any proprietary binaries and if this helps, thix box runs
fedora (XFree version 4.3.0-42).
I would like to know if I'm the only one experiencing this.
Thanks, Mathieu.
