GPLv1 can't be later than v2, does it?
OTOH, I'd assume v2+N either takes away rights ( == closes loopholes, ==>
no "you" will take the option if they want to make use of the loophole,
i.e., the clause is of no use), or gives more rights to the "you",
something the giver probably did not intend.
Either way, it makes little sense to me (IANAL and all that, anyway).
