I think we were talking about the root, not the cwd.  However, the same
issues apply.  I think the cleanest is to not do anything, although it
may have some serious problems.
For the normal case where you'd have no processes except a pseudo-init
running, you'd just do chdir("/"); chroot("/");  before you
execl("/sbin/init", "init", 0); but I don't know if there are other
applications in which it would be an issue.
