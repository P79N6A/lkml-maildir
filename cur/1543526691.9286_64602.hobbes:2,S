RTC_UIE:
hwclock, chronyd, adjtimex (at least my version).
I am emulating RTC_UIE, on my HW it is a simple check to see if the 
seconds field is updated, done in a 200Hz interrupt. It is usually much 
better than what hwclock can achieve from userspace.
Never cared about the other RTC programmable interrupts and do not
know any application.
