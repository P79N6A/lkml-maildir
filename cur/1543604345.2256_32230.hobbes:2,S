Subject: __alloc_pages error / badblocks proccess killed

Kernel is 2.4.10. While doing a 'badblocks -w -s -v /dev/hdg' i've found
some errors.
badblocks first write a pattern in the disk, and after having finished
that part, it compares data actually written in the disk and checks
for errors, then it's when i get these errors, several allocation
failed messages, and VM killing first syslogd, klogd and in last place
badblocks proccess. Any idea why is this happening, are VM changes in
2.4.10 causing this ? Most of the RAM (320mb) is used by blackblocks,
but almost no swap is used.
