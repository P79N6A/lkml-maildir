Hi,
This is a request for Linux kernel related project ideas.
 I am Computer Science Engineering final year student.  We have to do
a project of one year duration . I formed a group of two and we
decided to do a project in Linux kernel. Our interests are in Virtual
memory management, file system, process scheduling and load balancing
in Linux clusters.  Last year we did a study of Linux's page
replacement mechanism.  As I am not experienced as you people, please
suggest me some ideas.
