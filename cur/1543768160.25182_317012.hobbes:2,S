Jeff sent in fixes which were dependent on other things I had, we're maybe
several weeks away from 2.6.12, so I figured there was plenty of time to
get things fixed up - best to get it all flushed out and fix any fallout
rather than hang around, given that UML seems to be still changing in
fairly significant ways.
