Hello All!
    I have little bit theoretical question. As usual ;-)
    From what ever piece of doc I see says that STREAMS are good.
    They are part of SUS (at least v3 has them).
    Sun's docs reffering only cases when one may want to use them.
    This was the first pointer to problems: docs are missing the
       "dark side" of STREAMS.
    Can anyone give any pointers to information why STREAMS are _not_
       part of Linux kernel yet?
    (Besides that no-one needs/merged it in kernel ;-)
    What kind of problems this implementation of I/O has?
    (Low performance and high latencies I expect - but what's else?)
    Any sort of RTFM will be very appreciated.
    Thanks in advance.
