Sounds interesting...
But how much can you optimize the instructions in microcode (or whatever this
CPU calls its internal control code) over the microcode of a *decent*
processor that does not have this feature? Branch prediction and modern
scheduling on the CPU should already optimize the use of the processor's
functional units as much as possible with the help of compilers.
Another point might be to customize the functional units to perform modified
calculations. But I really can not think of applications that would benefit
from customized functions? -- If the processor's ALU or FPU is not designed to
do an "ADD, MUL" in one cycle, you can not teach it to do so with new
microcode. On the other hand, if it does have such a functional unit, any
CISC or RISC processor will make it available via an opcode.
Any obvious benefits?
Olaf.
