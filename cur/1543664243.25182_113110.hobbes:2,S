For KDE 3.1 I've written a mount watcher, which checks the modification
time of the /etc/mtab to recognize mount/unmount activity, which broke
for linux from scratch( for now, they have updated there install
instructions), because they linked to /proc/mounts, which doesn't seem
to support mtime. 
If the mtab is really completly removed, is there something else I can 
use to track mount activities from userspace ? I don't want to retrieve
the whole mounted list all the time and compare each entry to my
internally stored list, just to find out that nothing has changed
anyways.
Kind regards
