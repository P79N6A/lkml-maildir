Hi.
I just tried booting with the ACPI interpreter on this Panasonic
Let's Note CF-M1. After it correctly identified my ACPI controller,
and then said it couldn't enable it, hda lost interrupt and didn't
regain it, which stopped the show. Recompiling without ACPI support 
fixed the problem.
Yes, I'll do the regression testing now.
