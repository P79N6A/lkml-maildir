You are certainly right here. However, I thought the existing ACL 
implementation was going to provide the detailed EA specs on top of the 
generic EA spec. I can see why you would want to reserve certain EAs for 
ACL use in the EA spec though. It would be just like reserving syscall 
numbers and that makes a lot of sense...

Ok. (-:

That is a short coming of the EA spec. Agreed. Or rather it is a flaw in 
the EA design as there shouldn't be any magic handlers. I have always seen 
EAs as a means to store things in files that isn't the file data but other 
random pieces of information. The fs shouldn't care what those are.

Viewing it from this point of view you are of course right.
The ACL API should only use EAs as backing store, no magic handlers 
attached to the EAs. Then the system would not be open to abuse. The ACL 
part of the fs can of course make use of the EA backing store if it wants to.

So the ACL API is flawed.

Indeed. I would favour an abstraction at vfs level and fs specific methods 
as I described in previous post because this really divorses the two layers.
I know code speaks but I am more interested in making NTFS work properly 
read-write and only then implement ACLs in it at the moment...
Best regards,
Anton
