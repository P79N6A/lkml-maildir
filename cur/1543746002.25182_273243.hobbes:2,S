Ok, I also added the comment to the "other" smp_wmb() which was already there just in case...
It is mandatory that this timer->base = NULL is visible to other CPUs only after
the list_del() is complete. If not, then mod timer could see it NULL, thus take it's
own CPU list lock and not the one for the CPU the timer was beeing removed from the
list, and thus the list_add in mod_timer() could race with the list_del() from
run_timers() or del_timer().
