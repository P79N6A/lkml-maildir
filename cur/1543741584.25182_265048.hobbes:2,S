Usually it already helps if the main options have some additional 
dependencies like "depends on PCI", which in this case is not needed 
anymore.
The other possibility is to put a dummy config symbol inbetween:
config PDC202XX_DUMMY
	bool
if it neither has prompt nor a default, it won't be saved, but I'd rather 
would like to avoid that for a minor esthetic problem.
bye, Roman
