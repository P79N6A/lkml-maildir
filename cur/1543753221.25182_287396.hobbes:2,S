Corner case: how do we handle the case where:
mount --make-shared /foo
mount --bind /foo /foo/bar
A nested --bind without sharing makes sense, but doesn't when sharing is
enabled (infinite loop).
How about a rule that states that for all Ai,Aj in p-node p, Ai must not
parent Aj in the vfsmount tree.  This can be enforced at graft time.
