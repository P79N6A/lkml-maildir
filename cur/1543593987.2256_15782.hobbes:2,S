However, I can confirm that your symptoms are _precisely_ identical to
mine - when rsync locks up, stracing it on the 2.4.2 end causes it to start
up again.
At the time I suggested it was because of a missing wakeup in 2.4.2 kernels,
but I was shouted down for using 2.2.15pre13.  Since then I've seen these
reports appear on lkml several times, each time without a solution nor
explaination.
Oh, and yes, we're still using the same setup here at work, and its running
fine now - no rsync lockups.  I'm not sure why that is. ;(
