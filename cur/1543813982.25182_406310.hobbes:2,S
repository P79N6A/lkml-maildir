I had a long description in an earlier email feedback; but the summary
of it is the GET command is generic like TASKSTATS_CMD_GET; the message
itself carries TLVs of what needs to be gotten which are 
either PID and/or TGID etc. Anyways, theres a long spill of what i am
saying in that earlier email. Perhaps the current patch is a transition
towards that?
