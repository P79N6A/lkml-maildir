hmm, that might be interesting for applications
like apache which allow to append arguments by
'building' a 'virtual' path ...
http://www.kernel.org/list.cgi/some/more/args
where the web server actually decides where the
script ends and the arguments start by checking
the filesystem ...

if the file is removed, but some attributes are
'locked' by access, will the 'other' attributes
remain visible or disappear ... leaving a partial
'view' of the contents? or did I get the idea
completely wrong?
