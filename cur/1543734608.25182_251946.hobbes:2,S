The feature of supporting more threads is there and meant to be
supported, so "> 32K breaks anyway" doesn't really fly; it should
be fixed.
The rwsems just want ia32 to use generic rwsems. /proc/ is a much
bigger mess but far from insurmountable. I suppose someone has to
be willing to mess with it for that to be fixed, and it may need
other vfs-related help (ino64_t support?).

Reducing the PID space so the pid's can be formatted in 4 digits
doesn't sound particularly compelling. 64-bit pid's wrapping sounds
rather unlikely, but if so, 128-bit pids are more likely to withstand
various physical arguments against pid wrapping ever happening.
The middle ground is already where kernel/pid.c stands, so I'd prefer
to leave this alone unless you have deeper concerns about it than
4-column displays and pid reuse problems (which want larger pid spaces,
not smaller). The primary complaint I've heard about pid reuse is
actually that smaller pid spaces (e.g. 32K) wrap far too quickly,
sometimes numerous times per second on larger systems with parallel
process creation activity. It's unclear what the pid wrap speeds are
for the workloads they reported is with the now-permissible pid_max
(in fact, I've since forgotten who reported this).
