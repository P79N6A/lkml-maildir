Good morning Marcelo, could you please also consider switching to the somewhat
more dense format used by Linus recently? It makes the changelogs a lot more
readable.

and alike aren't actually very useful one-line summaries of the patch in
question to a "casual" reader, sorry.
In the first case, I can guess that probably, it is a new driver added; or
maybe it is just an update to an existing one? In the later two, what is
fixed? How does it affect my own code, or my running system?
The good work by all contributors not withstanding, it would be very nice if
they could make the summary slightly more useful before sending a patch to
Marcelo, for which I would like to thank everyone in advance ;-)
Sincerely,
    Lars Marowsky-Brée <lmb@suse.de>
