Yeah, a bit more text may be helpful. Many systems still use usbfs and
should work just fine without that option. Adding a udev rule will also
work.
The next version of HAL will depend on that udev rule. We have seen too
many unpredictable event timing problems with the usb_device class, and
will switch to the nodes provided directly by the usb-device instead of
the separate class device. How does that help text sound?
  This option provides backward compatibility for systems where
  usbfs is not mounted, and no udev rule like this exists:
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ACTION=="add", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", \
      NAME="bus/usb/$env{BUSNUM}/$env{DEVNUM}", MODE="0644"
Thanks,
Kay
