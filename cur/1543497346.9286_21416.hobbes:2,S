I think it may well be a problem of e2fs. Your method does not involve any

I see one in the kernel log when I issue a mount command.
I have appended a piece of syslog - it shows the following:
1) I insert, mount and directly unmount an ext2 formatted MO after having
   unmounted and removed an other ext2 formatted MO.
