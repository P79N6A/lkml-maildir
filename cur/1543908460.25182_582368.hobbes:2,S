	unsigned char f(unsigned long *p)
	{
	        return *p & 1;
	}
with both
	powerpc64-linux-gcc (GCC) 4.3.0 20070731 (experimental)
and
	powerpc64-linux-gcc-4.2.0 (GCC) 4.2.0
(sorry, I don't have anything newer or older right now; if you
really care, I can test with those too)
generate (in 64-bit mode):
	.L.f:
		lbz 3,7(3)
		rldicl 3,3,0,63
		blr
and in 32-bit mode:
	f:
		stwu 1,-16(1)
		nop
		nop
		lbz 3,3(3)
		addi 1,1,16
		rlwinm 3,3,0,31,31
		blr
(the nops are because I use --with-cpu=970).
But perhaps you do not care for PowerPC, in which case:
	i686-linux-gcc (GCC) 4.2.0 20060410 (experimental)
(sorry for the old version, I don't build x86 compilers
all that often; also I don't have a 64-bit version right
now):
	f:
		pushl   %ebp
		movl    %esp, %ebp
		movl    8(%ebp), %eax
		popl    %ebp
		movzbl  (%eax), %eax
		andl    $1, %eax
		ret
If you want testing with any other versions, and/or for
any other target architecture, I can do that; it takes a
few minutes to build a compiler.
It is quite hard to build a testcase that reads more than
one part of the "long", since for small testcases the
compiler will almost always be smart enough to do one
bigger read instead; but it certainly isn't inconceivable,
and anyway the compiler would be fully in its right to do
reads non-atomically if not instructed otherwise.
