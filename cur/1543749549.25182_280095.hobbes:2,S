Hello,
I have a problem with the virtual tun/tap device on my sparc64 (kernel 
2.6.9). I try to do:
struct ifreq ifr;
ifr.ifr_flags=IFF_TAP | IFF_NO_PI;
ioctl (dev, TUNSETIFF, &ifr);
After doing this I expect to find the name of the new interface in 
ifr.ifr_name. But it remains unchanged. ioctl's return value does not 
indicate an error. The device has actually been created (according to 
ifconfig).
The same piece of code works fine on my x86 machine.
Regards,
Stefan Boettner
