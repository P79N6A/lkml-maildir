You're not alone... I have the same problems: 2.4.22 works, 2.4.23
locks up apparently randomly. I cannot get a backtrace with sysrq
either.
Have you tried running with the NMI watchdog? I cannot run it myself
because I have to disable APIC support since my motherboard is
buggy. To do so, try booting with "nmi_watchdog=1" or "nmi_watchdog=2"
depending on your configuration. Check Documentation/nmi_watchdog.txt
for details.  Also verify that the NMI oopser works by checking for a
non-zero NMI count in /proc/interrupts.
If only I could get a backtrace... :-)
Phil.
