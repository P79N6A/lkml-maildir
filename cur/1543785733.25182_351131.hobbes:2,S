That's exactly what I surmised as well.  Our e-mails must

Exactly.  My own testing has focused on bootup time measurement.
Historically, the time spent before time_init() has been relatively
small and so I haven't (often) focused on trying to measure it
accurately.  Although, I have done this on occasion to get
complete results.
Andrew's suggestion of a replaceable clock function would
satisfy me.  What do other's think?
