Two things - are you sure that openembedded contains the patches to
fix the two biggest binutils issues we have, as documented on
http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/developer/toolchain/
 ?
Secondly, are you seriously suggesting people like Jan Dittmer, who
provide a cross-architecture service should jump through some loops
just to get a working toolchain for the ARM architecture?
Jan, how do you feel about this?
