The code is populating IDTs before APs are online, so for a given set of 
processors i would want to install new IDT entries like so;
node_set_intr_gate()
{
	cpumask_t mask = node_to_cpumask(node);
	for_each_cpu_mask(cpu, mask)
		set_intr_gate(per_cpu_ptr(cpu_idt_table, cpu)....
	....
}
Which before resulted in only setting the IDT entry for the BSP.
During boot, i prepare all processor IDTs so they are always 
ready for processors coming online and should take care of hotplug cpu 
too. The only problem with normal bootup is that the node_to_cpumask is
unreliable.
