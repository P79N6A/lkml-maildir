If you have got to the stage of doing "real world" tests, I'd be
interested to see results of tests that best highlight the improvements.
I imagine many general purpose server things wouldn't be helped much,
because they'll typically have little free memory, and will be
continually working and turning things over.
A kernel compile on a newly booted system? Well that is a valid test.
It is great that performance doesn't *decrease* in that case :P
Of course HPC things may be a different story. It would be good to
see your gross improvement on typical types of workloads that can best
leverage this - and not just initial ramp up phases while memory is
being faulted in, but the the full run time.
Thanks,
Nick
