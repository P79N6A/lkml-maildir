MASK_CHUNKSZ is a named constant not a variable.  Once we pick a value
it can never change.  The specified legal values are for 1) varying to
test for algorithmic correctness, and 2) giving the list of values from
which we must pick the permanent value before too much more time goes by.

No.  snprintf will fill to the end of the buffer and not place the
trailing \0 if it has to.  (I read the vsnprintf code this morning
just to make sure of that).

I am pretty sure the code is within a hairsbreadth of being minimal.
It will be interesting to find out.
