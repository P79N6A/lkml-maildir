chroot() is present in v7, thank you very much.  /usr/sys/sys/sys4.c has
chdir()
{
        chdirec(&u.u_cdir);
}
chroot()
{
        if (suser())
                chdirec(&u.u_rdir);
}
and back then it didn't stop lookups by .. at all - u_rdir is only used
in the beginning of namei() (when pathname starts with /), plus the obvious
refcounting in exit()/newproc().  So give me a break - back when it had
been introduced, it didn't do anything jail-like _at_ _all_.
That check appears only in BSD:

 eloop:
with spectaculary lousy commit message ("lint and a minor fixed") by
wnj.  Feel free to ask Bill Joy WTF he had intended.  At a guess,
more consistent behaviour in chrooted environment (i.e. pathname
resolution looking as if the subtree had been everything).
To talk about root-safety of _anything_ at that point is bloody ridiculous.
