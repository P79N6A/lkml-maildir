If Al is testing combinations that Andrew doesn't regularly test,
then Al might expect to find problems that Andrew didn't find.
Non-specific complaints that make it all sound too hard are
not particularly constructive.  But then Al was trying for the
"particularly constructive" achievement award of the day ;).
I find that the defconfig crosstool builds of *-mm more or less always
work for the popular configurations.  That meets my needs just fine.
