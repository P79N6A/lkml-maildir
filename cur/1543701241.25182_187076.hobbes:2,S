Hi Jeff,
I applied the tg3 portion of these patches.  Unfortunately it doesn't fix
the one persistent bug which AFAIK affects only me in the entire world. :-(
I'm the one with the ASUS A7V8X with builtin Broadcom Corporation NetXtreme
BCM5702 Gigabit Ethernet(rev 02) that doesn't initialize quite right.
Even with this new patch I have to do an ifconfig down/up before the chip
starts to function.  <sigh>
