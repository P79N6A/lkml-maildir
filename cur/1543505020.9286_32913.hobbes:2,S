there's a race somewhere that's causing shrink_mmap to deduct too much
from buffermem, making it go negative.  i don't think that it's specific
to a particular driver.  i haven't been able to simply and consistently
reproduce the race -- maybe you could come up with some way to do this?
is it specific to how much data you copied, for instance?
