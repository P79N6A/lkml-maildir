Sure they can - but then the variable size page cache becomes even
more trivial to implement. ;)

Backed up behind real work. :/
Hopefully I'll have something tonight from my small test box.
it'll be some time next week before I get a chance to do anything
on a hardware raid array.

I think you mistook my "hw RAID" as a "HW RAID adapter". I was
talking about "HW RAID arrays" as in rack mounted controllers on the
other end of multiple FC HCAs.
What I'm talking about is the difference in perfomrance when we can
do large enough I/Os to be able to do full-stripe writes on this
sort of hardware.  Modern HW raid arrays go much faster when you do
aligned, full-stripe width writes and right now x86_64 linux is
not able to do this....
Cheers,
Dave.
