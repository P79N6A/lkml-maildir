	-- Nothing in dmesg; when it freezes or reboots, even if there're
some messages on console, they wouldn't be seen in graphics mode. As I
said, now my suspicion is netfilter's ipt_recent; I've turned it off
and now waiting. Another kernel I'm using now (2.6.24-ovz-006.5+) is
built with stack usage reporting; that's the latest stack depth
report:
[   54.312696] modprobe used greatest stack depth: 3904 bytes left
	Dunno whether it's rather low or ok.
