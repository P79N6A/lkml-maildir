I have been wrestling myself with D state hangs (ext3/ 
reiserfs) in 2.5.7X-mmY for a while now, but haven't been 
able to capture a sysrq-T. I have a question, though 
(inspired by the trace you got): who does a finish_wait() 
for a !is_sync_wait() process after
blk_congestion_wait_wq() 
or __wait_on_buffer_wq()? Both of these functions can 
return after a prepare_to_wait() without a matching 
finish_wait(). 
So perhaps you could try backing out the aio-* patches?
Just 
a thought.
