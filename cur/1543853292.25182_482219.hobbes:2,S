Mmm.. Okay, so we have a kludge fix (just get rid of the printk's we added).
But I would like to find out more about what is going on.
We seem to be getting lots of "leftover interrupts".
I'll look through my full qstor block driver (the high-performance
queuing driver, out-of-tree), and see if we missed an IRQ-mask bit
someplace in the simple sata_qstor.c re-implementation.
Cheers
