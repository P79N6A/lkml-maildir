Your chipset cannot be detected by the surrent SiS IDE patch because it
takes a list based approach to find supported chips and their
capabilities rather than a more intelligent detection scheme (I've sent
Lionel code which shows how to do that). Over time (often a very short
one) a device list is missing valid members. In your case, the SiS
driver doesn't know about your SiS737 chip and it defaults to the least
common denominator - the ancient SiS5513 IDE chip.

You just thave to add it to the device list. There are other chips
missing as well.

Well, it does but at the expense of correctness ;-)

The problem is that the calculation of the index into the active time
table is incorrect in *all* three lines above! In the ATA66 case the
shift is wrong and causes an zero value regardless of the register
setting. In the "old" ATA100 case the index is calculated from the
correct bits but is missing the shift by four from the line above;
because of the too large index you see the OOPS. The "new" ATA100 case
is wrong because it takes the wrong bits into calculation.
