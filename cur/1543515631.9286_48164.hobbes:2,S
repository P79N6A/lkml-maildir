You have two different option to access data with this technique:
o	queue a tq_immediate task, mark_bh, and try (down_trylock()) again
	later ASAP
o	queue a tq_scheduler task, mark_bh and call a blocking down() and
	continue from kernel context (not from irq/bh context)
All depends on the latency you have to achieve.
