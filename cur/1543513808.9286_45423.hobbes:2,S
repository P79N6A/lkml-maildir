hey all, this is my first post so please be nice :)
I have a WangDAT3000 Tape drive (or so Windows says) attached to a
AHA1522 SCSI card, which works flawlessly in windows (I/O is 0x140, irq
is 10) but for the life of me i cant get it to work in linux, i have
tried using kernels 2.2.12 and 2.3.22, and with it built in AND as a
module.
The module seems to almost get there, and then fail. if i just type
"insmod aha152x" it says device or resource busy. BUT if i do "insmod
aha152x aha152x=0x140,10" (this tells it to use the I/O and ir that
windows does) it gives me this:
aha152x: BIOS test: passed, detected 1 controller(s)
aha152x0: vital data: PORTBASE=0x140, IRQ=10, SCSI ID=7,
reconnect=enabled, parity=enabled, synchronous=disabled, delay=100,
extended translation=disabled
aha152x: trying software interrupt, lost.
aha152x: IRQ 10 possibly wrong.  Please verify.
scsi : 1 host.
/lib/modules/2.2.12/scsi/aha152x.o: init_module: Device or resource busy
Plus the tape drive starts clicking and flashing, as if it wants to
work, btu just cant :) I have tried the other I/O (0x340) with no joy,
and every other irq and it gives me the same error as above.
Please, this is driving me crazy!! i can only back up windows stuff and
that is really annoying me, because nothing on my windows partition is
important :)
anyway, thanks in advance and stuff, if you need any mroe info just mail
me
Justin
