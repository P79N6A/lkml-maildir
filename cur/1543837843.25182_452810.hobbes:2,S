You'd need to audit all other users of the bits you wanted to borrow to 
check they would understand.  Like if you used PG_buddy (which I assume 
is what you are referring to above) then you'd get non-real memory 
getting merged into your buddies.  Badness.

Well it depends how you look at it.  You are going to need to know which 
pages are ram in each architecture to set the bits in the page*'s to 
tell us later.  So the problem is the same problem.  We don't 
necessarily have the information for all architectures.  As we don't use 
this for anything its questionable whether we need it.
Feel free to try and figure it out for all these architectures :).
