No, the driver core matches up drivers to devices.  You need to tell the
driver core to disconnect that match.  See the recent patches to lkml
that expose the functions you need for what to do.

Same as above, tell the driver core to do it.  Don't mess with the pci
remove functions, as there are still portions of the kernel that think
the link is there if you do that.
