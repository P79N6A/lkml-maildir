Ah, that makes it sound like 0.89H + fix is good, and 0.91 is bad. The reality
is 0.89H + fix is fine for people upgrading, as they have an old card that works
OK with 0.89H. 0.89H doesn't work _at all_ for 99% of new LAN cards. Almost all
new cards need 0.91 There will certainly be cards that don't even work with
0.91, as the quirks of some clone chips still haven't been sorted out. I haven't
seen complaints on the Tulip mailing lists, from users of older cards, that 0.91
broke a working system. What problems does it cause?
