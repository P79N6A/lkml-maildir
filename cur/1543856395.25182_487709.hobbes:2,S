Oh, I'm sorry I totally missed the CC of gcc@gcc.gnu.org.  My point  
was just that while it _could_ be done with GCC and some ugly macros,  
a basic form of C++ templates usually produces much nicer and more  
descriptive error messages (leaving out all the reasons C++ isn't  
usable in the kernel for the sake of academic discussion).  The  
template syntax is also a bit more descriptive than is the macro  
syntax for achieving the same thing.
Cheers,
