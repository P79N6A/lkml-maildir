Another good reason is i_sem.  If you've got more than one process doing
something to that directory, you spend lots of time waiting for the
semaphore.  I think it was andrew that reminded me i_sem is held on
fsync, so fync(dir) to make things safe after a rename can slow things
down. 
reiserfs only needs fsync(file), ext3 needs fsync(anything on the fs). 
If ext3 would promise to make fsync(file) sufficient forever, it might
help the mta authors tune.
