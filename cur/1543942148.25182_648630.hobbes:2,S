what matters most isnt really any documentation but what programs really 
do, and how it affects users.
in this case i think we should offer a .config option to set the 
randomization behavior, and should perhaps make the more conservative 
one the default.
New distros (with 10,000+ binaries that work just fine with 
randomization) will turn on max randomization by default, while people 
like you who mix 1996 binaries with a 2008 kernel will use a more 
conservative default.
