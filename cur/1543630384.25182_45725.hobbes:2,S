Both MIPS64 and our NUMA IA64 implementation have weakly ordered I/O.
The primitives outlined above should be sufficient to order I/O and
memory references on both platforms without unnecessary penalties.
Thanks for adding me to the Cc: list, sorry it took me so long to
respond.
It might also be good to summarize the ordering issues in a document
in the Documentation directory.  I've got a little something started
(see the ia64 patch for 2.5) for I/O ordering, and I have another
document that covers CPU memory ordering too that I could probably
contribute.
Thanks,
Jesse
