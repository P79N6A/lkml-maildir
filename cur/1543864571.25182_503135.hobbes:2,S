Does this mean that it has builtin i815 video, too?
How would I be able to "try both cases", then?
I somehow would have to configure it to boot with builtin graphics and
thus show 0x1130 and 0x1132 PCI IDs, right? Help, I'm confused...

OK, I'll keep working on this (trying a backup specific to those registers
above).
I suspect that your patch might actually additionally help in my case, too,
but of course I first need my enhanced PCI space backup to prevent it
from locking up.
IOW, your patch might then enable me to skip vbetool hackery entirely
since graphics mode appearance would already be correct.
I'll verify this.
How to transform all this newly-gained knowledge into a *clean* generic
intel-agp driver layer is a different question, though.
Specifically, I'm unsure about all those xxx_configure() calls in the resume
function, this sounds rather unclean to me...
("let's just yank it all back into a clean default state, that will somehow
magically make everything work again after resume")
