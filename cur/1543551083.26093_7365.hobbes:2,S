So your smp_processor_id() looks like:
#define smp_processor_id() \
	(in_interrupt() ? (sp & ~(INT_STACK_SIZE-1)) >> (PAGE_SHIFT + 3) : 
                         (struct task_struct *)(sp & -8192)->current_cpu) 
? 
There is just an ugly problem: in_interrupt already requires the CPU id
to look up the table of interrupt counters.
Now you could change the code to use interrupt_processor_id() and
usermode_processor_id(), but what would you do in code which can
be executed in both ?
