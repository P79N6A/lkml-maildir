'df .': tried it and it did not do what was expected, but that can
definitely be fixed
'stat -f .': actually works
foo-filemanager: before copying a file or directory tree, checks for
free space in destination directory
None of the above examples need (and use) /etc/mtab or /proc/mounts.
Just because the info is not available about the placement of the
subfilesystems, doesn't mean that the subfilesystems don't actually
exist.
