To be honest, why use a distribution at all, or if you do use one, why worry
about 'following' it after installation, instead of using it as a base from
which to do your own thing?
Of course, it sounds like a lot more effort to install whatever you need from
scratch, but you also more or less cut out distribution-specific issues, such
as one package depending on another, and of course you get much more
flexibility.
John.
