That makes sense, but it's still quite a surprise, and a serious change
in behavior from as long as I've been compiling kernels.
How about a new "make install-norebuild" or something that doesn't
change current, relied-upon behavior?  Seems like the weirdos^Wusers
doing kernel fetches over nfs are probably the minority, and their small
numbers can be much more easily educated than the masses who expect
'make menuconfig; make install' to do what it's always done.  
If that's too invasive, how about restoring the old behavior with a
warning to stderr for a release or two?
