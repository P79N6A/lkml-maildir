OK. So it is practically technical difficulty rather than fundamental
reason ?   Why "move to other zone" way is not implemented ? It normally
should be cheaper than IO ?

Right. After being explained what without swap you have all pages pinned
it makes sense.  On other hand  why user Allocation will trigger OOM if
there are pages in other zone which still can be used ? Or are there any
restriction on this ?

Can't it just be just (theoretically) moved to other zone with
appropriate system tables modifications ? 
Well anyway it is good to hear "pinned anonymous" is only issue on
swapless systems.   Together with the fact what 2.6 VM does not seems to
swap without a good reason as 2.4 one did, I perhaps can just have swap
file enabled.
