Okay, here's an updated patch.
Hi Andrew,
This is a fix to the pgtable_quicklist code.  There is a GFP_KERNEL
allocation in pgtable_quicklist_alloc(), which spews the usual warnings
if the kernel is under heavy VM pressure and the reclaim code is
invoked.  re-enable preempt before we allocate the new page.
This patch is against 2.6.12-rc2-mm2
