C'mon, Linus, tell us how you _really_ feel.
Seriously, though, please please pretty please do not allow a facility
for "going through a simple interface to get accesses to irqs and
memory regions" into the mainline kernel, with or without toy ISA
examples.  Embedded systems integrators have enough trouble with chip
vendors who think that exposing the device registers to userspace
constitutes a "driver".  The correct description is more like "porting
shim for MMU-less RTOS tasks"; and if the BSP vendors of the world can
make a nickel supplying them, more power to them.  Just not in
mainline, please.
Cheers,
- Michael
