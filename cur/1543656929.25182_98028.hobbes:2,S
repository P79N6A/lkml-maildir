One thing I have found in doing low-latency research is the impact of
ext3 over ext2.  There is a periodic blip of high latency with ext3 not
seen in ext2.  Presumably due to the journal writeback of ext3.
It was not huge but a measurable increase.  This was on 2.4, so I am
curious how improved it is on 2.5.
