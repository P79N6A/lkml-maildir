What do you mean by "assed"?

It may be reasonable to have 64 bit arches that are not 
capable of 64 bit atomic ops. As far as I can remember sparc was initially
a 32 bit platform without 32 bit atomic ops.

The lval casts only become necessary if you truly define a separate 
type. Are the #define statements that bad?
