A better approach is this patch, it extracts the maps including the
section headers after each stage.  I sent it to lkml on Sat, 26 Feb
2005 with no response.  Apply the patch, make debug_kallsyms and send
me the .tmp_map* files.

Make it easier to generate maps for debugging kallsyms problems.
debug_kallsyms is only a debugging target so no help or silent mode.
