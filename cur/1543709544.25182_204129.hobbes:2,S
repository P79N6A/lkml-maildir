There's two things here, that it's important not to loose sight of.
First, it's not just kgdb that could stand to parse things earlier on
(console, as dwmw2 points out).  Second, unless we're going to throw in
the initalizations of the i/o drivers manually, we're already depend on
ld to do things right.
Besides, this is probably going to be the cleanest way to get things
working like we want them to, not how they work now :)
