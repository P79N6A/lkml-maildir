I got a HP Scanjet 3p with a SCSI card that got a 53c400a SCSI interface chip with only
one jumper without a label. The card was shipped with the scanner. I tried to insert
the module and it does the same that was written in this archive earlier: complaint about
business of the bus and then the machine stopped.
Is there any chance this is solved in the more up-to-date kernels from my 2.2.18?
