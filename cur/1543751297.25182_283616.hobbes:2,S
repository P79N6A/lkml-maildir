This quick hack works for me too. Thanks!
However, it is still easy to make PS/2 keyboard and mouse completely
unusable with the following "sleepless" shell script (but it probably does
not qualify as DoS because access to PS/2 keyboard is limited to local user
only):
while : ; do xset led 3 ; xset -led 3 ; done
Even after killing this over network login, both keyboard and mouse are
still unresponsive for about 10..20 seconds. It was not that fatal with 2.6.8.
