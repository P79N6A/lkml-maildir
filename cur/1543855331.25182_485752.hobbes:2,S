 > Changes this late in the piece rather hurt.
Fair enough.  This was a really close call to me but let's leave it
for 2.6.19.  I'll ask Linus to merge the patch below to fix amso1100.
I'm a little worried that other such uses might be lurking in the
tree but I guess no one has complained...
 > Your proposed change is still wrong for long longs, isn't it?
Yes, it would fail for aligning long long with an unsigned long
alignment on 32-bits.  But that's broken in the current tree too.
I'll post a patch that should work for everything -- how about if you
queue that for 2.6.20-early?
