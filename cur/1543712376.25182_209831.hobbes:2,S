Hi,
when selecting CONFIG_ATALK as a module the symbols register_snap_client and 
unregister_snap_client will be unresolved. As I understand it they are in 
net/802/psnap.c which does not get compiled when Appletalk is selected as a 
module. Compiling into the kernel works fine.
I found this posting from 1996 which seems to mention the same problem: 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/net/9603.1/0087.html
Does anyone know if the mentioned problems were ever fixed? Maybe CONFIg_ATALK 
should not allow the module option if it's not supposed to work anyway.
