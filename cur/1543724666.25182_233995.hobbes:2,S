The spinlock should be initialized by the serial core when registering
the ports ... can you find out for me how do you end up with the
port not registered but still trying to use the lock ? The port
do exist on tipb's even if it has no visible connectors (actually
some tipbs have an irda output on port B and port A is available
on the motherboard, I think on the modem connector, though there
is no "adapter" that I know of to get it out).

The IN from bad port is a different issue, it's probably issued by
another driver trying to tap legacy hardware, either serial.o or
ps/2 kbd, I suppose, check what else of that sort you have in your
 .config
