My favorite approach has always been:
	put_be32(cmd->cdb + 2, block);
Unfortunately there is no such function or macro!  It's easy to define an
inline function that would carry out the series of four single-byte
assignments that originally started this discussion.  A more sophisticated
implementation would expand to Andries' unspeakably ugly code on
big-endian platforms that don't impose a large penalty for non-aligned
4-byte accesses.  I leave it up to others to decide which is best on
little-endian platforms that can do unaligned accesses.
I think it would be great if some such utility routine were added to a
standard header in the kernel, together with its siblings put_le32(),
put_be16(), put_le16(), and the corresponding get_xxxx() functions.
