How do I do it with user-mode command? If user-mode command exists,
I'll drop this patch happily, but I was not aware of it existing. I do
not know about screen blanking combinations on neither of my notebooks
(neither toshiba, nor thinkpad). I could turn external display on and
internal off, but that is not quite the same as blanking and will have
bad side effects.
