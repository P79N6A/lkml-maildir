This doesn't appear to be the culprit. Or at least, doesn't fix the
problem.
	make INSTALL_MOD_PATH=mods/ modules_install
with a distro kernel config (ie: Fedora's[1]) still results in
1.8GB of modules (willy checked that it wasn't a Fedora toolchain
bug by reproducing on a Debian system.)
As near as I can ascertain, this is limited to x86_64, at least on
Fedora:
kyle@localhost ~/misc $ for i in *.rpm; do echo $i; rpm
	-qip $i | grep Size; done

x86_64 is an order of magnitude bigger than the rest, which have
identical debug options enabled.
