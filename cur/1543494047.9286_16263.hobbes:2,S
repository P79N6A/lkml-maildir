I would like to freeze my desktop state ( memory, CPU registers... ) on
the disk,
power it off and, when I switch it on again, load  back to memory what
I previously
dumped to the disk, in order to avoid the whole boot sequence and
recover very quickly.
It should act almost like a laptop in suspend mode (APM enabled):
but I want to be able to turn the power off.
Has anybody ever dealt with anything similar? Or does anybody know where
I could
find any documentation?
I've already read the Advanced Power Management Bios Interface
Specification
and been at 
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kharker/linux-laptop/apm.html
Thanks in advance, best regards.
