Ok third version, hopefully Dipankar proof now. 
Andrew, please consider applying.

As discussed in other thread.
 Notifiers could be locklessly traversed if there was no removal
 ever, except that the update order is wrong.
 
 Just needed an additional write barrier, so that a parallel
 running lockup can never see inconsistent state. As long as there
 is no unregistration or the unregistration is done using
 locking or RCU in the caller they should be ok now.
 This only makes a difference on non i386/x86-64 architectures.
 x86 was already ok because it never reorders writes.
