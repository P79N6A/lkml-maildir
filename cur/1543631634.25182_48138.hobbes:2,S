The /proc/net/snmp Udp counter InErrors includes the global
count. It would be expensive and usually unnecessary to keep
per-socket stats. Is there a real need for seeing the 
per-socket count?
If it helps, you can check the current bytes in the recv queue
in netstat output - you wont know how many bytes have been dropped,
but at least you know the amnt in the queue waiting to be read..
