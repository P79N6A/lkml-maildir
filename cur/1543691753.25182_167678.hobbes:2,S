Thanks, I've applied this and will send it off to Linus in a bit.

Do you have a proposed change to the current
Documentation/i2c/sysfs-interface document?  If you can think of better
names that make more sense, I'd be glad to change things to make it
easier.

No, we internally do not differentiate between isa and non-isa adapters,
so why should we force that on the user?  They work the same as far as
users notice, and now we are consistant in our naming.
