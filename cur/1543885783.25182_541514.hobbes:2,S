Converting the hid-ff drivers to be also transport-independent is on my 
TODO list, but it didn't happen yet.
Marcel - are you aware of any devices currently supported by USB HID 
force-feedback code, which have a bluetooth version, please? 
I'd propose the patch below, until I make the usbhid force-feedback code 
transport independent. Thanks.

[Bluetooth] HIDP - don't initialize force feedback
The current implementation of force feedback for HID devices is 
USB-transport only and therefore calling hid_ff_init() from hidp code is 
not going to work (plus it creates unwanted dependency of hidp on usbhid). 
Remove the hid_ff_init() until either the hid-ff is made 
transport-independent, or at least support for bluetooth transport is 
added.
