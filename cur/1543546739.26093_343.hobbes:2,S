It works great now. I got a month-old full rewrite of via82cxxx.c from
Vojtech Pavlik in the lkml archives and compiled it.
Linus: I think it should be included. The old driver is messy, hairy, and fails
to work here. The new one is clean, neat, and works fine. If you lost the
message I can send you the copy of the driver I got here.
