hah.  As long as you're running as root, chroot() again to a directory
below you, and you effectively broken the chroot and can make a relative
path to the old root. :)
I created a patch years ago that creates a chain of "chroot" points, and
any past chroot point would be considered a place that follow_dotdot
would consider a root.  There didn't seem much interest in the patch
though.
