Okay. But other than pseries_add_processor and pseries_remove_processor,
are there any other places where we _change_ the cpu_present_map ?
I agree that we need some kind of synchronization for threads which read
the cpu_present_map. But probably we can use a seperate mutex for that.

One of the primary reasons to move away from the mutex semantics for
cpu-hotplug protection, was that there were a lot of places where
lock_cpu_hotplug() was used for protecting local data structures too,
when they had nothing to do with cpu-hotplug as such, and it resulted 
in a whole mess. It took people quite sometime to sort things out 
with the cpufreq subsystem.
Probably it would be a lot cleaner if we use get_online_cpus() for
protection against cpu-hotplug and use specific mutexes for serializing
accesses to local data structures. Thoughts?
Thanks and Regards
