Ah, I have not. However, this setting was not present in 2.6.21-rc3, from
which configuration I ran 'make oldconfig'.
Make oldconfig does ask for this feature:
  USB device class-devices (DEPRECATED) (USB_DEVICE_CLASS) [N/y/?] (NEW) 
And I chose the default, breaking (my version of) lsusb, on Ubuntu Edgy Eft.
I enabled USB_DEVICE_CLASS, and lsusb worked again.
Thank you both for your quick answers!
Please consider this patch which clarifies the need for USB_DEVICE_CLASS:
