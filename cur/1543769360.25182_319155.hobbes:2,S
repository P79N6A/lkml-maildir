Unrealistic. We are in a constant state of development, the direction of which 
is determined by who is hacking on what, when - as opposed to "we need this 
feature or fix now so lets direct all our efforts to that". Unfortunately the 
SMP balancing changes need more than one iteration of a mainline kernel 
before being incorporated due to the potential for regression so the 
likelihood of "SMP nice" becoming part of mainline if it is based on this new 
code is going to be (at a guess) 6 months. Of course my patch could go into 
mainline in its current form and the SMP balancing code in -mm could be 
modified with that in place rather than the other way around but I just 
didn't get in early enough for that to happen ;)
