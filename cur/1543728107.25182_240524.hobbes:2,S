serial port IO is even more heavy, it also generates IRQ traffic. I'd
suggest the following tests: modified kernel without serial console, and
original kernel without serial console. This way you can find out 
whether the hang itself is triggered by the serial console.
another attack angle is to find out what state the system has during the
hang. Is it debuggable?
