   Really I think that for the long run I should start dropping the
   cache and buffer hashes replacing them with RB-trees to work fine
   everywhere without waste some base memory with fuzzy hash tables. I
   think that doing that everything should scale _far_ better also
   under the scenario you are describing.
   Comments from David? (note RB-trees != AVL ;).
If the page cache hash was 1 chain per system page, people would eat
memory scaled to how much memory they have.  And you approach ~O(1)
access time with a not-too-stupid hash.  At worst you eat a cache line
miss, and this is service on the order of 24 cpu cycles on most modern
machines where you'd have a lot of memory so...
Anyways, thats my position, and I'd be thinking about this sort of
stuff for 2.3.x, not now.
Another stupid idea I had, which wasted a lot of memory but could
remove a lot of buffer.c code and make things snappier, put
MAX_BUF_PER_PAGE buffer heads at the end of struct page, use them when
doing page I/O.  Zero race conditions, no funny buffer unused and
reclaim list races and synchronization, etc.  Also each of these
static per-page buffer heads have the appropriate pointers and some
other state setup already, so you don't need to do much to get an I/O
out the door.
But like I said, this is stupid, especially right now because the
buffer head structure is a little sizable.  If someone trimmed them
down a lot and perhaps changed them to really be "I/O tags" then this
scheme may make more sense.  Even nicer would be if these I/O tags
used an iovec[] so a lot of state is redundant in the page I/O case,
hint hint :-)
