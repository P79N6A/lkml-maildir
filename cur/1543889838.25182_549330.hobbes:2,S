(sorry my English)
I'm helping Márton Németh  in a experimental mail led driver
leds-clevo-mail.c for clevo laptops and I have problems with this
driver:
this files
/sys/class/<ledname>trigger,  /sys/class/<ledname>/dalay_on and
/sys/class/<ledname>/delay_off  are  created  as 644 permissions. Also
ROOT controls the led. I think write udev rules but my rules don't
change this permissions.
The clevo mail led is a trigger led (time-trigger) for blinks the led
when a new mail arrives.
How can I change the permissions of the sysfs objects in runtime or userspace?
the code of this driver is found at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/clevo-mailled/
Thank you.
Rodrigo Pereira
