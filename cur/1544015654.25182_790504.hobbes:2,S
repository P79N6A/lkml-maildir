I've been running a kernel with the scheduler patch on my x86-64 desktop
since Christmas.
Here are some test results... Workload in these tests is mostly starting
a browser and rendering a set of reasonably heavy pages which creates
CPU load spikes. BKL is a bit of a problem too...
I think this is reasonably good result.
Results for the deskop (x86-64), voluntary preempt enabled (as the
proprietary ATI display driver behaves badly with full preempt):
SCHED_OTHER:
maximum latency: 45098.2 µs
average latency: 366.2 µs
missed timer events: 16
SCHED_MM:
maximum latency: 10051.2 µs
average latency: 44.7 µs
missed timer events: 0
SCHED_FIFO:
maximum latency: 720.3 µs
average latency: 23.1 µs
missed timer events: 0
Results for an OMAP3-based platform, preempt enabled:
SCHED_OTHER:
maximum latency: 44.7 ms
average latency: 1.8 ms
missed timer events: 227
SCHED_MM:
maximum latency: 19.2 ms
average latency: 1.1 ms
missed timer events: 23
SCHED_FIFO:
maximum latency: 10.7 ms
average latency: 0.7 ms
missed timer events: 1
