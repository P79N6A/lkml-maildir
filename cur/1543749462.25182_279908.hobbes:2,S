Composite plugins are likely fairly simple (cat *) so they shouldn't be
required to implement seek on their own.  In OO terms, they should
"inherit" a more global facility, which would be based on cached pipes.
But definitely for files that are likely to be large, but still seekable
(zipfiles), you want the plugin to provide its own seek support.
