Linus, I've seen no evidence that statistical filters are trivial
to beat.  Can you provide some?

Why is that?  Statistical filters (so-called 'Bayesian) have lower 
false positive and false negative rates than many other approaches.
Bogofilter is one of the better ones, although it is not particularly
Bayesian.

You are saying that this sort of false positive is acceptable to
you.  With no corresponding claim as to the corresponding false
negative rate.
So-called yes/no values are simply tests with their own failure
rates.  As such, they have strictly less information than 
scores or probability estimates that offer a confidence
estimate as well.  The trick is in combining several sources
of evidence, and 'Bayesian' is but one method of combining this
evidence.

Spamassassin performs quite poorly with the default weight
given to its statistical filter.  It works much better
if you increase the weight.  Many tests show that it works
better still if you simply discard the ad hoc rules and
rely on the 'Bayesian' filter alone.  I have found that
almost all of the false positives I've encountered in
the last 3 years have been due to Spamassassin's ad hoc
rules, not its statistical filter.
