Looks pretty good.  What's the motivation for the in_vmlist_region()?
I don't think that I need that for ia64 ... so it might be better to
have separate #ifdefs:
#ifndef KCORE_BASE
#define	KCORE_BASE	PAGE_OFFSET
endif
#ifndef in_vmlist_region
#define in_vmlist_region(x) ((x) >= VMALLOC_START && (x < VMALLOC_END))
#endif
