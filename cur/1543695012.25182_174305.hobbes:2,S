Gabor,
I'm booting the kernel with acpi=off, noapic and nolapic options and 
according to syslog it is really disabled. Lockups are very rare (they 
come either during
30mins after boot or never) but I cat get them very quickly when using 
the framegrabber with ivtv driver. The ivtv driver itself works rock 
solid on older PIII system
(btw, that PIII runs SMP kernel !). So I think there are definitely DMA 
problems with nforce2 boards under linux.
