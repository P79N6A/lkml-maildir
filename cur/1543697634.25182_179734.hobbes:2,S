Hey, you posted rc4 before I could talk about rc3... ;)
Good and bad news. Good are that pci=noacpi works. Bad are that
ACPI still fails to setup PCI bus 1 on a ServerWorks LE.
I think this is not a showstopper, but...
Relevant info is at
http://giga.cps.unizar.es/~magallon/linux/acpi/
dmesg for -rc3 without acpi, just what CONFIG_SMP uses, with acpi, and with
acpi but booted with pci=noacpi (all with lspci at the end), and output
from dmidecode, biosdecode and acpidmp.
I have also submited an entry in bugzilla.
For my blind eyes, it looks like an IRQ routing problem.
TIA
