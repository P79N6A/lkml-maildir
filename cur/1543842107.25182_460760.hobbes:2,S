Use language similar to the naughty stuff that is getting through?
Seriously though, a quote from Matti's lkml announcement:
IF we take it into use, it will start rejecting messages
at SMTP input phase, so if it rejects legitimate message,
you should get a bounce from your email provider's system.
(Or from zeus.kernel.org, which is vger's backup MX.)
In such case, send the bounce with some explanations to 
<postmaster@vger.kernel.org> -- emails to that address
are explicitely excluded from all filtering!
