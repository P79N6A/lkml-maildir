   : o	fchmod on AF_UNIX sockets doesnt work like BSD
   It works like linux-2.0, right?
   Seems, fixing it requires to attach i_sb to socket inodes
   to hook notify_change. It may have some bad side effects for VFS.
I discussed this with Linus some time ago, and we agreed that this
should not be changed at all for 2.2.x.
