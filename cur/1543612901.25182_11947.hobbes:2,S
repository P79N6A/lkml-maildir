Subject: question on select:  How big can the empty buffer space be before select returns ready-to-write?

For instance, it appears that select will return that a socket is
writable when there is, say 8k of buffer space in it.  However, if
I'm sending 32k UDP packets, this still causes me to drop packets
due to a lack of resources...
Is there any IOCTL that can tell select how much space to require
before it thinks a socket is writable?
Many thanks,
Ben
