Disagree, run 1 callback per tasklet and then you will not measure the
cost of this callback compared to the cost of talking to the hardware
entering/exiting kernel etc...

in an irq flood load that stalls userspace anyways it's ok to spread the
callback load into the irqs, 10 tasklets and in turn 10 callbacks per
irqs or so. That load isn't scheduler friendly anyways.
the one property you need is not to be RT like eventd, to be scheduler
friendly, but guaranteed to make progress too and that's what softirqs
can give you and that's why I used only softirqs in my rcu_poll
patches too ;).
