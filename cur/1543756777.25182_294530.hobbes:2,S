There's a single page of PTEs for mapping high memory and the atomic
slots are a small subset of that. They're fixed in number for
complexity reasons - we don't want to have an allocator here:
/*
 * kmap_atomic/kunmap_atomic is significantly faster than kmap/kunmap because
 * no global lock is needed and because the kmap code must perform a global TLB
 * invalidation when the kmap pool wraps.
