The difference is that there is a much larger number of state
combinations possible in OpenGL than in something stripped down for
"just 2D".  That can make it more difficult to know where to spend the
time tuning.  I've spent a fair amount of time looking at Mesa's texture
blending code, so I know this to be true.
The real route forward is to dig deeper into run-time code generation.
There are a large number of possible combinations, but they all look
pretty similar.  This is ideal for run-time code gen.  The problem is
that writing correct, tuned assembly for this stuff takes a pretty
experience developer, and writing correct, tuned code generation
routines takes an even more experienced developer.  Experienced and more
experienced developers are, alas, in short supply.
BTW, Alan, when are you going to start writing code again? >:)
