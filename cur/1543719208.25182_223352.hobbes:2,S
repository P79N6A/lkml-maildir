copy_*_user() has special-case code to handle 1, 2 and 4-byte copies, so
your patch should make no difference on x86.  Other architectures do not
have that optimisation.
So the patch is a tiny optimisation for some architectures.  However, it's
of very small benefit - we could make a million such changes.  Would prefer
more substantial things at this time, please.
