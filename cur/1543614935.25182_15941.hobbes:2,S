Unfortunately not an option. Cloning pine, though..
By the way, the 'forgot to include the patch' syndrome seems to be a
common problem with Mutt..

The other part of patchbot is to auto-bounce stuff off the queue when it

simplify manually bouncing patches with common comments. And exposing the
queue to the outside world. Allowing web-based patch upload might work
around the braindead mail agent problem.
