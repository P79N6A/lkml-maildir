Question: Shouldn't we be using "size_t" for unsigned int, and
"ssize_t" for signed? If the "ints" are going to be changed,
they probably should be changed only once. As I recall, size_t
was the largest unsigned int that would fit into a register and
ssize_t was the largest signed int that would fit.
Cheers,
