Subject: kernel-2.6.25-rc2,      CPU C state "active state" always remain C0 unchangeable by cat      'proc/'

On Fedora9 Alpha with  kernel-2.6.25-rc2,
I run " watch -n 0.1 "cat /proc/acpi/processor/CPU*/power | grep 'active
state'" ", I find that the CPU C state information "active state" remain
at "C0" and it do not change any time. The same issue also exit on
2.6.24-rc2 kernel.
But with RHEL5.1 kernel-2.6.18 the CPU C state information is normal.
Every 0.1s: cat /proc/acpi/processor/CPU*/power | grep 'active state'
