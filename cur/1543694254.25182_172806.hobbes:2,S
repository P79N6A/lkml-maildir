There are apparently several HP OmniBook models that don't poweroff with
ACPI under 2.4.22 as well.  
HP hasn't released a new BIOS for the OmniBook 500 since pre-2001, so I
have to boot with acpi=force.
Up through 2.4.22rc2 the OB500 shut down fine with ACPI.  Somewhere in
between 2.4.22rc2 and 2.4.22 ACPI shut down stopped working. With
2.4.23-pre7, it still doesn't work.  
Reboot, however, works fine.
Does anyone know what change occurred between 2.4.22rc2 and 2.4.22 that
would have caused the power down to stop working?
