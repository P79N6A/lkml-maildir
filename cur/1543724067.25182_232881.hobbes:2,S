Well, I have a machine which produces "APIC error" messages only if the
kernel has been configured with CONFIG_PCI_USE_VECTOR enabled. Without
CONFIG_PCI_USE_VECTOR, I get no APIC errors. The machine has a single
1.7GHz P4 in it, and the kernel has ACPI, APIC and IO-APIC support all
enabled. I can provide more detailed information if needed but it will
take some time since the machine is not connected to any network.
