I have never, ever had anyone complain before.  Now it's a big
hairy issue.  And aparently no matter what editor I'm using,
someone starts bitching, and giving sarcastic answers as to
how I'm not following some unspoken law.   I have never had a
problem reading continuously flowed text.  Apparently it's a
big deal in other parts of the world somehow.  
I really don't mind helping other people, and am willing to 
practice common courtesy.  Unfortunately no-one gives a good 
answer to what it is, they just assume you are an idiot if you
don't allready know it.  Ahhh, the unspoken elitism of linux
development...

You never answered my question.  What IS the standard?  I 
have never had this problem before, on ANY list, ever.
But now people seem to be making a bigger deal about the
format of my posts, and the MUA I use than the questions
I'm asking.
And, to be nice, I wrapped it by hand, since all the MUAs 
in existance seem to be broken.
Does anyone know of an elisp program/major mode/command to 
automatically do proper word wrapping?  There seems to be
one for everything else...
