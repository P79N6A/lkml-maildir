Hi.
I'm not quite sure whom this patch belongs to but I hope that it ends up
in the right hands by way of linux-kernel.
In order to get 'make dep' to make it through my tree (240-test13-pre1) I 
need the following patch applied:

Even if you're on the right track, you'll get run over if you just sit there.
