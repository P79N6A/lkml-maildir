Sorry to say, but weren't you the person who didn't recognize !! as the
idiomatic booleanizing operator?
I think you need to learn that everything that the compiler accepts
isn't necessarily idiomatic, readable code.  Consider
__attribute__((noreturn)); it's a nonstandard feature implemented using
a generic gcc mechanism -- thus what the compiler will accept is quite
flexible, because it's a generic building block.  It doesn't mean it's a
good idea.
The reason it's often written at the end of the expression mostly has to
do with bugs in some very early versions of gcc.
