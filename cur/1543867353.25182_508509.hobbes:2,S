As part of my personal preparation for "a new kind of things" i
finally went to the same idea with suffixes.
What i currently have is:
-- top file 'Linux.version', with first line:
3.0.0-rcX
which can be parsed to fill variables, used in build process (how many
`.' and/or `-' in it -- doesn't really matter), second line is the name;
-- 'MM.version' for MM tree;
-- '[a-z]*\.version' for anything else.
usual sort will place files in right order.

At least we have some discussion. Unless Linus use `sed' for patching
Makefile for versions, i think, to edit one or two lines in 50kB monster,
isn't so much pleasure ;)
