Ah no, I never use those montruous environments ! xterm is already heavy.
don't you remember, we found that doing "ls" in an xterm was waking the
xterm process for every single line, which in turn woke the X server for
a one-line scroll, while adding the "|cat" acted like a buffer with batched
scrolls. Newer xterms have been improved to trigger jump scroll earlier and
don't exhibit this behaviour even on non-patched kernels. However, sshd
still shows the same problem IMHO.
