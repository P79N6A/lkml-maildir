Why I need to ? OF COURSE chosen preemtion point ARE arbitratry. THIS REQUIRES
NO PROOF. It's default. ONLY when you have REAL PROOF that points are not
arbitrary they are not arbitrary. And no, benchmark is not considered to be
a proof. That's basically what Linus said and that SO obvious for any developer
that it does not need any explanation. Why it's not obvious for you I'm not
know.
