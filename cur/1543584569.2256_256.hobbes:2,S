ITYM ->prepare_write()/->commit_write().
See ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/ext2-dir-patch-S2.gz for example of
metadata in pagecache. For deeper metadata (== stuff that can
be needed to access with some pages locked, in case of ext2 that
would be indirect blocks, inode/block bitmaps and group descriptors)
you need to set ->gfp_mask of address_space to prohibit IO on
allocation. See drivers/block/loop.c - it has to do the same to
->i_mapping of underlying file.
