I think it's in pretty good shape now.  The stuct typedefs should go before
we put it in mainline so we don't need to do a major sweep through everything
just after it appeared in SCM history, but that's just a minor thingy.
Else I'd say it looks good unless we see problems with the AOP_TRUNCATED_PAGE
patch we should send it to linus after the time for the big core merges is
over (aka in about a week or two)
