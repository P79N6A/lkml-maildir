I just fixed that as well last week and 2.4.4-pre4 + rawio-3 should be just SMP
safe, faster and my patch is racommended for integration.

With my patch applied the kernel doesn't execute wait_on_buffer from wait_kio
here, it first executes kiobuf_wait_for_io and that is also a performance
optimization because kiobuf_wait_for_io will sleep only once and it will
get only 1 wakeup once the whole kiobuf I/O completed.

The end_kio_request in CPU1 with my patch applied is executed before CPU0 can
execute wait_kio so it cannot race the above way.
Thanks for your comments (and yes you are right that the above race can happen
in all 2.4 kernels out there except in the aa latest ones).
