As opposed to potentially taking the system down? I don't
think so.

Then you'll get people not enabling it on real workloads, or
tuning it off if it bugs them. No, the point of having a WARN
there is really for people like SGI to detect a few rare failure
cases when they first boot up their 1024+ CPU systems. It is not
going to spam anyone's logs (and if it does it *needs* fixing).
What you don't want is to kill the responsible process, because
at that point they're deep in the kernel, probably holding other
locks and resources.
