You gotta be kidding.  It does everything in terms of an SVR 4 VFS
vnode and then converts that to Linux VFS on dentries/inodes.  It was
obviously built by stuffing the Linux VFS under SVR 4 VFS code and
even documents the code as such.  Things like:
| /*
|  * XFS arguments structure, constructed from the arguments we
|  * are passed via the mount system call.
|  *
|  * NOTE: The mount system call is handled differently between
|  * Linux and IRIX.  In IRIX we worked work with a binary data
|  * structure coming in across the syscall interface from user
|  * space (the mount userspace knows about each filesystem type
|  * and the set of valid options for it, and converts the users
|  * argument string into a binary structure _before_ making the
|  * system call), and the ABI issues that this implies.
|  *
|  * In Linux, we are passed a comma separated set of options;
|  * ie. a NULL terminated string of characters.  Userspace mount
|  * code does not have any knowledge of mount options expected by
|  * each filesystem type and so each filesystem parses its mount
|  * options in kernel space.
|  *
|  * For the Linux port, we kept this structure pretty much intact
|  * and use it internally (because the existing code groks it).

No... No compatibility layer there.
