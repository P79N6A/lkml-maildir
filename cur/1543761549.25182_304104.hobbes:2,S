Additionally, in "real life", very few errors are cause by known errata.
If the drivers know about the errata, they usually already work around
them. Afaik, most of the errors are caused by transcient conditions on
the bus or the device, like a bit beeing flipped, or thermal
conditions...

Exactly. A given platform could use Intel's code as-is, or may choose to
do things differently while still showing the same interface to drivers.
Eventually we may end up adding platform hooks to the generic PCIE code
like we have in the PCI code if some platforms require them.
