Yes.  I like not being affected by bugs.  If you prefer to be affected
by bugs, that's up to you.

Indenting labels implies that they might be scoped with the other code
at that level of indentation.  If you see code that looks like this:
	for () {
		switch () {
		case foo:
			while () {
				if () {
				} else {
 quux:
 				}
			}
		}
	}
you really want the quux standing out at you.  Otherwise you might think
this was a nice, easy to understand function.

We don't tend to mass-run code through Lindent.  This may or may not be
a bad thing, but the fact is that it just doesn't happen.
