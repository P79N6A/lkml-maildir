That got fixed (by ugly means).

But rc5-mm1 remains broken with that .config:
arch/ia64/pci/pci.c: In function `pci_acpi_scan_root':
arch/ia64/pci/pci.c:354: warning: implicit declaration of function `pxm_to_node'
...
arch/ia64/pci/built-in.o(.text+0xe92): In function `pci_acpi_scan_root':
: undefined reference to `pxm_to_node'
This bug exists in mainline.
Also,
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0xd9a72): In function `e1000_xmit_frame':
: undefined reference to `csum_ipv6_magic'
I don't know how this got broken.  ia64 seems to be the only architecture
which doesn't have an implementation of csum_ipv6_magic().  This bug
appears to be introduced by git-netdev-all.patch.
