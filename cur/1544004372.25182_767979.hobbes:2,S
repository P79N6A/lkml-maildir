This patchset is improved our previous scheduler(sent 04/01/2008) and resolves some problems.
And, we scheduler can control at the two layers.
Namely, it can control I/O among groups and I/O among tasks within a group.
I always check in containers ML mainly.
So, I found I/O control patches in it ML, dm-iobnd, io-throttle, Naveen's Anticipatory I/O scheduler,
Vasily's CFQ scheduler and Vivek's Another IO controller.
And today I know the BFQ scheduler, so I'm not looked at the BFQ yet.
Now, I'm looking its patch.
Thanks, comments.
