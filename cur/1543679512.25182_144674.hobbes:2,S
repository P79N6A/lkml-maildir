The problem I experienced was when I disable parport in the IBM BIOS, PnP
gets invalid values it set io 0x0 -> 0xfffffffffff and some other misc
values for IRQ and DMA.
This might fix that issue.
isapnp: Card 'Crystal Audio'
isapnp: Card 'Creative SB32 PnP'
isapnp: Card 'U.S. Robotics Sportster 33600 FAX/Voice Int'
isapnp: 3 Plug & Play cards detected total
There some other issues though that are being worked on.
