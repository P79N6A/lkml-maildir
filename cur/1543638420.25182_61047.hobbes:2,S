Note that _most_ PC clocks are a hell of a lot better than 2% a day, so
that was really meant as the worst case for fairly broken hardware. But it
apparently does happen.
A more realistic schenario is less than 0.1%, but with the caveat that if
the machine goes to sleep, the error goes up to infinity..
(Think of the current "jiffies" update and gettimeofday() _without_ any
ntp or /etc/adjtime. For most people it is good enough to use as a wall
clock. But some people literally lose or gain a minute every hour.
That's the kind of drift I'm talking about).
