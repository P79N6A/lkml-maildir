Moving the actual use of set_cpus_allowed() from the cgroup code to 
sched.c would probably be the best in terms of a clean interface.  Then 
you could protect the whole thing by sched_hotcpu_mutex, which is 
expressly designed for migrations.
Something like this:
	struct cgroup_iter it;
	struct task_struct *p, **tasks;
	int i = 0;
	cgroup_iter_start(cs->css.cgroup, &it);
	while ((p = cgroup_iter_next(cs->css.cgroup, &it))) {
		get_task_struct(p);
		tasks[i++] = p;
	}
	cgroup_iter_end(cs->css.cgroup, &it);
	while (--i >= 0) {
		sched_migrate_task(tasks[i], cs->cpus_allowed);
		put_task_struct(tasks[i]);
	}
kernel/sched.c:
	void sched_migrate_task(struct task_struct *task,
				cpumask_t cpus_allowed)
	{
		mutex_lock(&sched_hotcpu_mutex);
		set_cpus_allowed(task, cpus_allowed);
		mutex_unlock(&sched_hotcpu_mutex);
	}
It'd be faster to just pass **tasks to a sched.c function with the number 
of tasks to migrate to reduce the contention on sched_hotcpu_mutex, but 
then the put_task_struct() is left dangling over in cgroup code.  
sched_hotcpu_mutex should be rarely contended, anyway.
