What are you guys talking about? IIRC kernel doesn't use
swap for its vital data structures. I recall only one
kernel thing which goes into swap: tmpfs data. Caching network
filesystems may also use swappable data, but currently grep
catches only cifs.
IOW swap is for dirtied userspace data. Please correct me
if I am wrong here.
