In some cases (ia64 for example) there are additional restrictions on
each memory chunk.  For example, the EFI memory map may describe a
contiguous chunk of memory 28MB in size, but if your kernel page size
was set to 64MB, you'd have to throw it away as unusable.  Should that
be dealt with in the arch independent code (i.e. is similar stuff done
on other platforms?) or is it best to only add sections that are usable?

That would be great, what you have below seems sensible.

So what you have here would be only for boot time setup, while
CONFIG_NONLINEAR would be used in lieu of multiple pgdats per node or a
virtual memmap in the case of intranode discontiguous memory?
Thanks,
