It was originally done in kernel space prior to us having initrd
support, as a small extension on what was already there. I don't see a
good reason to move it to working from an initrd because:
1) We're then assuming that everyone uses an initrd/initramfs, which is
not true
2) We need to provide a way for this userspace program to obtain from
the kernel the signature of the image and information about what we want
the signature to look like. It will also then need to be able to tell
the kernel to delete the image.
3) If you want the userspace program to actually read the signature
itself, the kernel still needs to tell the userspace program where to
find that signature (what device, block and blocksize). That device
can't be mounted/swapon'd to do this; it needs to be a raw read.
4) This whole method means there's even more code to maintain!
Regards,
Nigel
