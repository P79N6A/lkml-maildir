Why bother?  If threads work best for an application why rewrite it to not use
them?

Easier to understand?  That's debatable, unless you are not familiar with
thread programming.

They may be harder to debug, but that doesn't mean we should just throw them
out.  Threads can and do make many applications much easier to design and
implement without having to go to a slower process/fork() model or a more
complicated model using nonblocking I/O with select()/poll().
