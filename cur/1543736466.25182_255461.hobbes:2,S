Almost.  Think of software TLB refills, especially HPTE.
The order needs to be:
	ptep_get_and_clear
	flush_tlb
	set_pte
Any page faults happening "in the middle" will end up as
virtual no-ops once they grab the page_table_lock.
Luckily the PPC64 code in 2.6 seems to have a fix for the
race already.  Martin's race is a 2.4 thing only and needs
a 2-line change to establish_pte(), to make the code do what
I described above.
