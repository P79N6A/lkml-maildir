Not on XFS.

This only becomes a problem if the system has enough pages dirty to
be triggering throttling so that the 1byte writes are converted before
the data actually hits the server.
Even then, if you are on an XFS filesystem with a sunit/swidth set,
the alocation alignments and speculative allocations will go a long
way to preventing fragmentations.
If that doesn't work, then set the extent allocation size hint on the
XFS inode to 128k or 256k to set the minimum all ocation size for the
file to span the distance between the 1 byte writes. This attribute
can be inherited from the parent directory on create, so it's a
set and forget type of thing...
i.e. XFS has lots of ways to prevent perfromance from degrading
on these sorts of issues.
Cheers,
Dave.
