I'm thinking about how to do the mqueue "kernel allocated memory" accounting, 
and I have a problem. A user can create an mqueue of given size via sys_mq_open()
using "msg_attr" structure (will be created in do_create). I can account for how much 
memory has been allocated, but I can't at "deaccount" at kfree() time (this memory 
is stored in inode->(mqueue_inode_info *)info->messages), because I dont know how big
it is (its user selectable via "msg_attr" structure). 
What can be done about this?
Creating a data structure to account for "allocation->allocation size" 
sounds overly complicated at first, but might be necessary if correct
accounting is necessary?
Gracias
