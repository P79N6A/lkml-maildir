It may be faster on your beefy 8 CPU boxes.  But many people are
creating, for example, little wireless access points with 200 Mhz
StrongArm CPUs and similar little devices that lack the major CPU
horsepower of big-iron system.  Such boxes would be far better
off offloading crypto to a little crypto chip, right?
