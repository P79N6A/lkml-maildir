That's fine for me, but I'd expect other people to find problems with it.
Would it not be better to allow drivers to decide which type of blanking
they want to use depending on the current parameters set via the set_par
callback?  Only the drivers themselves know what their fb_blank method is
capable of performing.
I think with the above you'll inadvertently encourage drivers to mundge
the fb_blank function pointer in their set_par method.
There is also the argument about wanting soft blanking, but hardware power
saving.
