Hi guys,
The test11-pre5 seems to be unusable:
o starting up vim(1) takes many seconds instead of the usual <<1 second
o trying to strace vim takes even longer
o trying to ltrace vim panics the kernel but kdb is also unusable -- can't
  decode stack traces etc. Perhaps I'll go back to non-kdb kernel and hope
  to at least get a decent oops out of it (maybe Linus was right ;)
I will come back with more info. Oh btw, this is on a 4-way Xeon with 6G
RAM. But my desktop (2xPIII with 1G RAM) works with test11-pre5 just fine
for ages (since 1am last night), without any problem (of course vim starts
fast as it should).
Regards,
Tigran
