It is, but what would it explain? You're only having playback problems, right?

Can it be forced to use dma2=0 (an 8-bit channel, and the usual capture 
channel on es18xx)? However, that might not be the issue anyway:

This sounds very suspiciously like a difference with playing through the 
native ALSA interface and the OSS emulaion. Could you and/or Bob confirm 
that sox is using the OSS emulation and not ALSA natively?
I could very well imagine the ALSA OSS emulation being broken on Alpha. I 
doubt any of teh developers has an Alpha. And if aplay works correctly this 
seems very likely.
"sox" _can_ use ALSA natively as well by the way (see manpage for the 
version you have installed).

Vital if play is using the OSS interface...

Mmm.
