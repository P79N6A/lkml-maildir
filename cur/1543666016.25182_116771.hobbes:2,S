The ACPI patch implements CPU-enum-only support in exactly the same way
that 2.5 does, so my thinking was that this code is no longer needed.
If this *has* been the roadblock to 2.4 patch acceptance for the past 16
months, then obviously I would be willing to revert that cset and keep
it, but I do think the patch does keep the functionality provided by
those files - i.e. the ability to get ACPI table parsing for cpu enum
without adding the interpreter to the kernel image.
