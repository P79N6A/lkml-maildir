The filesystem sets specific bits in the mode mask and elsewhere in the 
inode to mark the file as a dev node, and which major/minor device 
number it should be linked to.  The kernel device drivers register to 
handle a given device number.

So you did you pass the console=ttyS0 parameter to the kernel?  Did you 
configure your inittab to spawn the getty on the serial port instead of 
/dev/ttyN?  You might want to take a look at the Linux Serial Console 
HOWTO.
