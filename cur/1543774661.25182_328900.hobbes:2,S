I don't know why it's named "plugins", but the mechanism itself gains a
lot.  For one thing, certain new "plugins" for new kinds of files
(cryptocompressed files, for instance) can be almost as easy as new
plugins for (say) XMMS.
Still, Hans, it's high time to either rename these "plugins" or start
talking about bytecode engines...

Explain to me how this is worse than how you currently encrypt your
secret files?
