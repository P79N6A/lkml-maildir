Hi!

Hmm, well, I'm not going to debug -vanilla when there's better
codebase pending in -mm, so -mm is better because it has chance to get
debugged.

Insert printk's to see what is slow, then contact acpi list.

Can you insert printks to ohci_hcd to see what went wrong there?

This looks like interrupt problem. Can you try noapic and/or disabling
acpi for irq routing?

Hmm, also try pci=routeirq.
