Hello
I am the branch manager of Mega Bank Sao Tome & Principe PLC; A 
few years ago, Mega Bank was very liquid and its shares commanded 
respect in the Sao Tome & Principe Stock Exchange; Infact, a fast 
growing and vibrant bank.But its Chairman and Directors siphoned 
the 
bank liquid reserves to fund their lavish lifestyles, buying expensive 
real estate properties all over the world. A top secret memorandum from 
the Central Bank of Sao Tome & Principe revealed that Mega Bank will be 
liquidated under the bankruptcy laws of Sao Tome 
& Principe in May 
2006.
This will allow the chairman and the thieving Directors to 
escape with their loot! This is because the bankruptcy and insurance 
laws in Sao Tome & Principe were not designed to protect the 
shareholders and customers of the Bank; rather, the laws were designed 
to protect the Owners
and Directors.
I have worked over 30 years in 
Mega Bank and I am entitled to provide a pension for myself
and my 
family. Therefore, I have perfected a plan to invest a sum of 
USD10million abroad. I intend to purchase one or more of the following 
as a long term investment plan:
1. Placement in a bank or financial 
institution.
2. Purchase of Real Estate properties.
3. Purchase of 
Stocks in good performing companies.
4. Outright purchase of good 
performing companies.
You could be my partner and earn legitimately 
25% of this money. Are you interested? If so, please reply and forward 
immediately your contact details including the following to my secure 
email: dgmb12345@nowzer.com
A. Your complete address.
B. Your 
Telephone and fax numbers.
Once I receive your above details, I will 
commence with the onward transfer of the funds to your country.
Sincerely,
David Green
