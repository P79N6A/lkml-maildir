This explains why the box was actually usable.
>(the patch is made against 2.4.20-pre8-ac2 but it should apply.)
It does. Compiled and boot4ed the patched kernel.

Thanks!

Not really, it just popped up a dozen times within 3 hours within 7 
minutes (hmm, God knows what I was doing exactly at that time to 
trigger it).
And I actually realized it only because some <tab> completion in 
ncftp hang (of course it came out on the console but who is looking 
there all the time since that's not the primary PC).
I'll see if it occurs again .....
