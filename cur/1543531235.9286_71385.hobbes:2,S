Oh dear. You mean the standard says a 1Gb simulation calling fork() to
email a status update should only succeed if there is 1Gb of spare VM
lying around?!
I can understand malloc() being defined as allocating memory, rather
than just address space (as opposed to the current Linux
implementation), though.
The current implementations do have some merits, but there should
probably be an alternative call which DOES allocate memory.
