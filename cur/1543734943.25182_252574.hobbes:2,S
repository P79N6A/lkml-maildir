Why bother?  It is V3, it should be left undisturbed except for 
bugfixes.  Please, spend your efforts on reducing V4 latency and 
measuring whether it fails to scale to multiple processors.  That would 
be very useful to me if someone helped with that.  V4 has the 
architecture for doing such things well, but there are always accidental 
bottlenecks that testing can discover, and I am sure we will have a 
handful of things preventing us from scaling well that are not hard to 
fix.  It would be nice to fix those......
The hard stuff for scalability, the locking of the tree, we did that.  
We just haven't tested and evaluated and refined like we need to in V4.
