   This fixes a SMP race condition in the non atomic version of the
   br_read_lock (at least with the alpha semantics of rmb()) and removes a
   rmb() not necessary in the slow path.
Your code does nothing more than change a rmb() to a mb(), and you
claim this fixes a bug particularly on Alpha.  Then if one goes to
look at include/asm-alpha/system.h:rmb(), they would see that it is
defined identically to mb().  What could you possibly be fixing?
For the record, I believe it is correct on UltraSparc and that cpu has
the most fine grained control of memory ordering desided in the
rmb()/mb()/wmb() interfaces.  It allows to specify these operations
precisely.  Therefore, Alpha must give the same or more strict
semantics for these interfaces.
Finally, referring to the other part of your change, I believe the
rmb() removal is wrong.  The counter decrement memory operations must
not get moved past the memory read in the spinning loop.
Later,
