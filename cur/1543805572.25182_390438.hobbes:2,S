I don't think there are any questions about what the "whole" of Linux is 
governed under. It's governed by whatever the most 'restrictive' license 
usage is, which is 'GPLv2 Only'. (The fact that GPLv2 Only doesn't apply 
to the whole kernel or perhaps even to some past kernels doesn't matter - 
you still can't package the whole as GPLv3)
The only discussion I see taking place any longer is basically irrelevant 
to Linux and GPLv3 - it concerns whether or not other, older kernel 
releases were legally GPLv2 Only or not. A disagreement on either the 
intent, mechanism or action of parts of the GPL license, if you will.

What does Linux compatible mean? Linus expressed some frustrations with 
some of the new terms, so perhaps in that sense the new license is not 
compatible.
If I'm reading him right, he doesn't want to restrain vendors like TiVO 
from using the kernel and subsequently refusing to provide the public with 
encryption keys necessary to build kernels to run on that hardware (for 
example).

It's mental masturbation at this point. Suppose Linus approved of going to 
GPLv3... there may be some little technical gotchas in terms of "dead 
authors", but in that hypothetical, how many people would really be 
worried that the descendents of these dead authors would actively act to 
stop Linux from being distributed under the new license?
The bigger issue is that no matter where you fall on GPL's section 9, 
_lots_ of code is undoubtedly GPLv2 only. These living authors would have 
to agree to GPLv3, and as we now know, Linus does not.

Why? I think it's pretty much a dead issue.
