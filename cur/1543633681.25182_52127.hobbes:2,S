No.  I think you're looking back too far in UNIX history.
I imagine SIGBUS was originally defined as you describe,
but got hijacked by the inventors of the mmap system call
(only a limited number of signals available).  That overload
has been enshrined in standards for ten(?) years.
SIGSEGV is used where mapping itself cannot be accessed (no mapping
or insufficient permission); SIGBUS where mapped object cannot be
accessed - I/O error or, more usually, beyond end of (last page of)
file.  Linux just follows the standards on those.
It would be inappropriate to use anything but SIGBUS for no space.
