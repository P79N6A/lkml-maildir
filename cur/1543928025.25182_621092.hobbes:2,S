Subject: [PATCH 0/4] sched: group scheduler related patches (V3)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Here's V3 of the group scheduler related patches, which is mainly addressing 
improved fairness of cpu bandwidth allocation for task groups.
Patch 1/4 	-> coding style cleanup
Patch 2/4 	-> Minor group scheduling related bug fixes
Patch 3/4 (v1) 	-> Modifies how cpu load is calculated, such that there is zero
		   impact on !CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED
Patch 3/4 (v2) 	-> Modifies how cpu load is calculated, such that there is a
		   small impact on code size (but should have NO impact on
		   functionality or runtime behavior) for
		   !CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED case. The resulting code however is
		   much neater since it avoids some #ifdefs. I prefer v2.
Patch 4/4	-> Updates load balance logic to provide improved fairness for
		   task groups.
To have zero impact on !CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED case, please apply the
following patches:
	- Patch 1/4
	- Patch 2/4 
	- Patch 3/4 (v1)
	- Patch 4/4
I personally prefer v2 of Patch 3/4. Even though it has a minor impact
on code size for !CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED case, the overall code is much
neater IMHO.
Impact on sched.o size:
=======================
!CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  36829    2766      48   39643    9adb sched.o-before-nofgs
  36829    2766      48   39643    9adb sched.o-after-v1-nofgs (v1 of Patch 3/4)
  36843    2766      48   39657    9ae9 sched.o-after-v2-nofgs (v2 of Patch 3/4)
CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  39019    3346     336   42701    a6cd sched.o-before-fgs
  40303    3482     308   44093    ac3d sched.o-after-v1-fgs (v1 of Patch 3/4)
  40303    3482     308   44093    ac3d sched.o-after-v2-fgs (v2 of Patch 3/4)
Changes since V2 of this patchset [1]
- Split the patches better and make them pass under checkpatch.pl
  script
- Fixed compile issues under different config options and also
  a suspend failure (as posted by Ingo at [2])
- Make load_balance_monitor thread run as real-time task,
  so that its execution is not limited by shares allocated to
  default task group (init_task_group).
- Reduced minimum shares that can be allocated to a group to 1
  (from 100). Would be usefull if someone wants a task group
  to get very low bandiwdth or get bandwidth only when other groups
  are idle.
- Removed check for tg->last_total_load check in rebalance_shares()
  (which was incorrect in V2)
Changes since V1 of this patchset [3]:
- Introduced a task_group_mutex to serialize add/removal of task groups (as 
  pointed by Dipankar)
Please apply if there are no major concerns.
