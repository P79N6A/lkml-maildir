Compiling both -- usb-storage and option/usb-serial -- as modules did
work.
Ok, thanks a lot.
I assume that is because the built-in usb-serial/option did grab the
device so the init function wasn't executed. Putting both into modules
allowed that usb-storage grabbed the device first.
Anyway, my interpretation without any knowledge.
Best wishes
