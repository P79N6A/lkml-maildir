Just to be clear. I don't actually think this is mine. At least, they
never talked to me about it. Mine is covered by XFree license, so they
could have just compiled it, but I don't think so. Supposedly this
version doesn't perform the same as mine.

Right. It's non trivial, but it is progressing. I sure how to get it out
soon!

Those are correct. Here's a small plug. The website covers everything I
can find about 3D for Linux including my work, of course. If people know
other pieces I should add, please email them to me.
