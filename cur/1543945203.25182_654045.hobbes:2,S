Yes, the patch for the Xen domain builder to boot a bzImage using the 
Linux boot protocol rather than the Xen one.  Ian's patch will extract 
the ELF file from the bzImage, but still boot it by finding the Xen 
entrypoint in the notes, with %esi pointing to the Xen start_info rather 
than the boot_params (unless I'm missing something).
