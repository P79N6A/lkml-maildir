  [ACPI] check "maxcpus=N" early -- same as NR_CPUS check.
  
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2317
Broke by putting maxcpus (a variable which is only exported by
mpparse.c) into parse_cmdline_early().
The fix is to make it depend on the correct CONFIG_ option.
In the subarchitectures:
CONFIG_X86_SMP is the one that means "I want standard x86 smp code" and
that's what this should depend on.
