The problem is that if something is wrong regarding 32bit/64bit
compatibility (I am not saying Arnd will get it wrong, but
for a general rule someone will get it wrong and it has happened, e.g.
in ubsfs) then it is impossible to do any compat emulation
on read/write.
So I would actually prefer ioctl because it is sfer.
