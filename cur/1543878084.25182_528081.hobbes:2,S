Subject: 2.6.20-rt8 patch tweaked for 2.6.20.5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
I've tweaked patch-2.6.20-rt8 so that it applies to 2.6.20.5
The unified diff is attached to this message.
I'd be happy to hear comments on what I've done wrong.
78 hunks had to be offset and 3 hunks had to be fuzzed.
$ grep -B1 fuzz patch.log
patching file arch/ia64/kernel/iosapic.c
Hunk #3 succeeded at 469 with fuzz 2.
--
patching file kernel/fork.c
Hunk #9 succeeded at 975 with fuzz 1.
--
patching file kernel/sched.c
Hunk #46 succeeded at 3996 with fuzz 1.
What is the fuzz value, exactly?
Regards.
