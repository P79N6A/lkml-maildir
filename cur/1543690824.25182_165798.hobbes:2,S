Prove an original work which uses the proper "unprotectable API" to
operate in the Linux kernel is a "derived work".
You can't and never will.  It is an "original work".
"Original works" are exempt, what is not clear?
Oh I get it, because it happens to work in "Linux" it is not an original
work?  What a lame cast of mental giants.
