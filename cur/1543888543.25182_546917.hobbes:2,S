static ssize_t signalfd_read(struct file *file, char __user *buf, size_t count,
			     loff_t *ppos)
{
	struct signalfd_ctx *ctx = file->private_data;
	struct signalfd_siginfo __user *siginfo;
	int nonblock = file->f_flags & O_NONBLOCK;
	ssize_t ret, total = 0;
	siginfo_t info;
	count /= sizeof(struct signalfd_siginfo);
	if (!count)
		return -EINVAL;
	siginfo = (struct signalfd_siginfo __user *) buf;
	do {
		ret = signalfd_dequeue(ctx, &info, nonblock);
		if (unlikely(ret <= 0))
			break;
		ret = signalfd_copyinfo(siginfo, &info);
		if (ret < 0)
			break;
		siginfo++;
		total += ret;
		nonblock = 1;
	} while (--count);
	return total ? total : ret;
}
If 'count' is not a multiple of sizeof(struct signalfd_siginfo)), the read()
will return the next smallest multiple of `count'.
That is, unless `count' happens to be less than 1*sizeof(struct
signalfd_siginfo)), in which case we return -EINVAL.
This seems inconsistent.
Also, I'm desperately hunting for the place where we zero out that local
siginfo_t, and I ain't finding it.  Someone please convince me that we're
not leaking bits of kernel memory out to userspace in that thing.
