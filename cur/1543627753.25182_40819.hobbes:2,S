Hi,
Eric is right, I've started a syncookie fw using a daemon process for
now, because this is the first time I meet the kernel sources on a
larger project.
I do this using the REDIRECT ( ipchains ) / QUEUE ( ipfilter ) targets,
to get the packets to userspace. Once there, you can do what you want
using libpcap or syuscalls.
Regards and hope this helps
Frank
