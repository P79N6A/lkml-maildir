Jamie, the loop will call read(2) until data is available. With the trick
of checking the returned number of bytes you can avoid the extra EAGAIN
read(2). That's the point of the read(2) trick. The final check for RDHUP
will tell that it has no more to wait for POLLINs since there's no more
someone sending.
