OK folks, this is my second attempt to post the arch xen patches,
this time against 2.6.10-rc2.
We need 6 core patches and a bug fix:
 1. add ptep_establish_new to make va available
 2. return code for arch_free_page
 3. runtime disable of VT console
 4. /dev/mem io_remap_page_range for CONFIG_XEN
 5. split free_irq into teardown_irq
 6. alloc_skb_from_cache
Bug fix:
 7. handle fragemented skbs correctly in icmp_filter
The actual new architecture, arch xen, is too big to post to the list,
so here's a link:
 
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/netos/xen/downloads/arch-xen.patch
Likewise for the virtual block, network, and console drivers:
 
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/netos/xen/downloads/drivers-xen.patch
Applying the above 9 patches should give you everything you need to
build full-featured arch xen kernels.
Arch xen will be maintained by myself, Keir Fraser, Christian Limpach
and Steve hand. 
Cheers,
Ian
