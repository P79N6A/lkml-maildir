The stock SMP kernel increases jiffies in IRQ0, while HIGH_RES=y
emulates the tick via the lapic timer. If you disable lapic, hrtimer
emulates via PIT in the HIGH_RES=y case.

Not at all. Can you please apply the patch below and add "apic=verbose"
to the commandline ? This should give use some hint.
Watch out for "calibrating APIC timer ..." in the boot messages.
