And this is the beauty of a multi-author project.  Even if some
authors think that the license permits something, if any of them
understands it doesn't, he can try to enforce that WRT his own
contributions.  So those exploiting the gray areas of the license can
still get caught.

In Brazil, this is kind of contract/license is called a beneficial
contract.

That's correct, but with a catch: since the contract or license is
chosen by the licensor, in case of ambiguity in the terms, many courts
will interpret it in a way that privileges the licensee, regardless of
the fact that copyright licenses are to be interpreted restrictively
(at least in Brazilian law).  And IANAL ;-)
