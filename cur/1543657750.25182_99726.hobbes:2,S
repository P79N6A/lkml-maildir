I see. Ok, that can be fixed easily.

No. For portable applications it makes great sense.

So you want to chain people to your "propritaery solution"?

What kind of systems are you talking about? Operating systems?
Nearly all.

It might be a bit difficult to convert all applications to
sendfile. Especially those for which you don't have the
source code.

I don't see your point. Applications which really need the
performance will switch to sendfile anyway because of the
problems with mmap, you mentioned.
My patch is very simple and takes less than 1KB of code but
will speed up many applications and doesn't have a real
drawback (except when sending "normal" data which is larger
than a page - but that shouldn't happen very often).
Yet another advantage of my version is that you can use it
in conjunction with writev.
Unfortunately the linux-sendfile is not as good as the HP-UX
one. Under HP-UX you can define a "struct iovec" header to
be sent before the file is sent.
