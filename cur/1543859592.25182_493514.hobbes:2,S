Unfortunately, I cannot get the latest git version of the kernel to
boot on the ARM machine on which Martin and I are experiencing the apt
segfault. After the kernel is finished uncompressing it prints "done,
booting the kernel." as expected, but nothing more happens. I have
tried both with and without the patch. Hopefully either Andrei or
Martin will have better luck at testing this patch than I have had.
