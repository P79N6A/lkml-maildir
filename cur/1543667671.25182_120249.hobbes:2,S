Subject: timer hang with current 2.5 BK

If I remove the uhci_hcd or ehci_hcd module, then I
systematically get the following:
(EIP) run_timer_softirq+0xe3/0x400
timer_interrupt+0x1a3/0x3f0
do_softirq+0xa1/0xb0
do_IRQ+0x23f/0x380
common_interrupt+0x18/0x20
code: 89 50 04 89 02 C7 41
kernel/timer.c:302: spin_lock (kernel/timer.c:c02f7b00) already
locked by kernel/timer.c/398.
killing interrupt handler etc
Presumably this is related to the stall_timer.
This has been happening for ?one week?, and
still occurs with current BK.  Occurs with and
without preempt (UP).
Any ideas?
Thanks,
Duncan.
