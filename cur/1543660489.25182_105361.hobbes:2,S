Subject: [PATCH] Trivial: Changes all <module>.o to .ko in Kconfig files
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/1/23/138

This patch goes against 2.5.59 and changes every <modulename>.o to 
<modulename>.ko in every Kconfig they occur, except the ones I overlooked ;)
It's a rather large patch so it's gzipped and attached.
