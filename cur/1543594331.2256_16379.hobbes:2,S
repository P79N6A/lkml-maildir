For certain specific cases this is in itself not true either. Also for many
many implementations.
Specifically
1.	If the receiver closes and there is unread data many TCP's forget
	to RST the sender to indicate that data was lost.
2.	There is a flaw in the TCP protocol itself that is extremely unlikely
	to bite people but can in theory cause wrong data in some unusual
	circumstances that Ian Heavans found and has yet to be fixed by
	the keepers of the protocol.
