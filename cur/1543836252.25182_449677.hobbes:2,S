If a 32 architecture chooses to implement a 64-bit cputime_t, this
expression might go wrong for very long-running tasks and high HZ.
Perhaps we should do all this in terms of cputime_t and export everything
to userspace as u64?

It's a bit weird to be multiplying RSS by time.  What unit is a "byte
second"?
If this is not a bug then I guess this is an intermediate term for
additional downstream processing.  There is information loss here and I'd
have thought that it would be better to simply send `delta' and the rss
straight to userspace, let userspace work out what math it wants to perform
on it.  If that makes sense?
I see that the code has been like this for a long time, so treat this as a
"please educate me about BSD accounting" email ;)
