Hi,
I can't boot with 2.5.39 because the built-in  ide driver (ServerWorks 
CSB5) can't see hda, and VFS says "Cannot open root device "hda3" or 
03:03" which results in a kernel panic
Works fine with 2.4.20-pre? with identical kernel setup and kernel 
parameter root=/dev/hda3
Is this a known problem? Any way around it or patches?
TIA
Andrew
