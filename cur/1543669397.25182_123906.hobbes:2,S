You can have as much entries as you want, the only limit is that you can
only have one user prompt per config entry and the type must not conflict.
This example could have been done with a single entry and this is usually
prefered to keep it more compact, but you don't have to.

You can Cc: me if you want, but I can mostly only comment on technical 
aspects. The subsystem/driver maintainer has the final decision.
bye, Roman
