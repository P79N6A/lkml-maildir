It's really not that much code.  When you strip out most of the comments
(including the big 65-line copyright blurb required by my employer), the
entire implementation is less than 300 lines of code.  A large part of
the patch is just comments (which in this case I think should be there
because as you say, lockless programming is tricky).
I do think there should be some sort of API that provides the same type
of functionality as my patch.  It's much better than having lots of
replicated code.  However I am not very attached to my particular
implementation.  If you or someone else wants to post a patch that is
simpler yet provides similar functionality, I think that would be great.
Perhaps some code could be borrowed from oprofile or the machine check
handling code or somewhere else.
