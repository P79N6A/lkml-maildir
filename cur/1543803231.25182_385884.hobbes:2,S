No, the ADB keyboard can operate in 2 modes that can be set with a PMU
command, I forgot about that in my earlier comments. In one mode, you get
the "special" behaviour by default on the Fx keys and you get Fx when
pressing Fn-Fx, and in the other mode, you get the Fx by default and the
special behaviour when pressing Fn-Fx.

No. If the first one is 0, the second one will not matter in the first
version, while it will in yours.
