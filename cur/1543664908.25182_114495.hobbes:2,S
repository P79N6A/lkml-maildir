This shows what taking out kallsyms can do:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
1860575  293780  337404 2491759  26056f kernels/linux-2.4.18/vmlinux
1936720  311656  157792 2406168  24b718 BK/testing-2.5/vmlinux
1936592  437556  158720 2532868  26a604 BK/testing-2.5/vmlinux-with-kallsyms
The 2.5 tree was current yesterday.
The .config files were as "functionally equivalent" as I could make them,
and except for CONFIG_KALLSYMS, were identical for the two 2.5 images.
gcc is 2.96.
