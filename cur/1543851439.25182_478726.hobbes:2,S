You just need to know the voltage of the battery, what else?

Do such batteries exist at the moment, or are you just speculating? I
don't quite see how a battery could report remaining energy in time
units, as power consumption varies over time. Hand crank revolutions
wouldn't be a very useful unit either, unless you know how much energy
a revolution provides, and then you can just convert it. Percent would
make some sense, but you can only express the remaining energy this way,
not the total. And if you know the total in mAh or mWh, you can multiply
by the percentage and you get the remaining energy in the same unit.
