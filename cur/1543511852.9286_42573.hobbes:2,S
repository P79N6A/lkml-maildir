It's not end-user documentation; it's the Kernel-Hacking HOWTO, and is
intended for use by those who hack on the kernel sources. There's 31
instances of the word you find so offensive in those sources right now,
which means you're going to run into that language whether you like it or
not.
In other words, get used to it. Noone gives a fuck. :-)
