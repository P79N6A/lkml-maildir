That part of your specification is part of normal modem behaviour: If
it picks up the line and doesn't hear a dial tone, it drops the line
without even trying to dial.
In fact, I basically do that myself, and there's never been any
problem with it. The only difference in my case is that it polls when
the phone charges are cheap rate and not when they're otherwise - I
have to pay for my calls to the surfboard.

That's the easy part - your script can do that without any hardware at
all. Try the following bash script:
 Q> #!/bin/bash
 Q> X=`/sbin/ifconfig | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | grep "^$1\$"`
 Q> if [ -n "$X" ]; then
 Q>     exit 0
 Q> else
 Q>     exit 1
 Q> fi
Save that as /sbin/online with mode 0755, then use `online ppp0` as
the command to run when you want to determine if you're online. It
returns TRUE (=0) if you are online, and FALSE (=1) if not.

Ah...you've already met what I referred to earlier - sorry.

I find that strange, as I have "call answer" as well, and I have no
problem using my modem with ATX4 in the dial string. I'd have to
presume that either your telephone provider uses a different dialtone
if there are messages waiting, or your modem incorrectly detects dial
tone in the first place.
If it's the latter, you could easily find that replacing the modem is
the cheapest option.

SOme modems will interrupt the line if there's a glitch in their power
connection, so plugging your phone in through the modem is rarely a
good idea.

I'll have a go at designing one for you, but don't hold your breath.
