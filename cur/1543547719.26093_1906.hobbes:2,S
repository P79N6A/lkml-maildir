You might think you're encouraging people to think instead of
monkey-tap, but consider the people you're putting off. It's the other
side of that coin.

It's not just the skills. It's the time and energy. It's more effort,
because you have to download it (and hope it's current and kernel
drift hasn't rooted it), and you have to maintain more kernel trees
(otherwise you send out patches with IKD mistakenly included (and
don't tell me it doesn't happen, even by the most esteemed
developers)).
Skilled people are usually busy people (they have their fingers in too
many pies). While they are better able to download and apply IKD, by
the same token they are less inclined to, because they are busy, and
besides, they know that they *shouldn't have to*.

Would you classify IKD as a pile of warts you wouldn't want to see in
the kernel?
Surely there must be some useful features that can be included in the
kernel without uglyfing it or slowing it down (configed out)? Leaving
aside the social engineering attempts, of course :-)

We're already carrying a small city. One extra factory won't
hurt. It's just source bloat, not object or data bloat.
