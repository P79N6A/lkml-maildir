Maybe this would be the better !PREEMPT_RT version.  But the true mutex
that Ingo is making would be used for the PREEMPT_RT side.
This code at least brings down the over head of semaphores where they
are not really needed.  Looking at the code slightly (I must admit, I
spent maybe 30 seconds looking at it), it does seem a little similar to
Ingo's.  Could just be coincidence, since the methods are pretty much
what multiple people would come up with.  But you both work for RedHat,
hmm.
