Well the x86-64 option was there first; you have to ask whoever
added the i386 option why they used a different name
But I normally added aliases as people reported them. Nobody did in 
this case.
One reason is probably that noapictimer is not very useful on x86-64 --
the nolapic_timer is really more a workaround that only started making
sense on HRT because it made "apicmaintimer" default. 
On current x86-64 which doesn't do that there is very little reason to use it
and you'll usually just break things.
So I guess the real reason is that they're not actually identical
when you look closely.
