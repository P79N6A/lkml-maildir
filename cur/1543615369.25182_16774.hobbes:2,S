sorry,
  should have included that all timings are consistent.
  (usr/sys vs reported wall clock time vs external stop watch time)
  for reference: the effect arises for a several different memory types
  (pc133, pc133 ecc, pc133 reg ecc, pc2100) and the impact is similar.
  thus if it was only a memory bandwidth issue, i would expect
  the results to depend more on the memory/chipset in question.
