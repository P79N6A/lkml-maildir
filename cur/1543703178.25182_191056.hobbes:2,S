I think you mean __VMALLOC_RESERVE?  For the most part it's straightforward
to bump it up.  _However_, that breaks boot loader assumptions about where
to load initrd, causing mayhem in that case (and initramfs?).  That's
second hand info: if I'm wrong or out-of-date, Peter is the authority
and will correct me; or try Google VMALLOC_RESERVE boot.
