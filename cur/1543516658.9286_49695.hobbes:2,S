Because Linux allows per-user timezones and users are often allowed to
mount their own FAT filesystems.
That might sound contrived, and it almost is, but in my case, I run my
machine's system time at UTC, partly because I want to make sure things
like my FTP server use UTC, but as a user I have TZ=CST6CDT.  If I (as
a user) mount a floppy, the mtimes should match the mtimes on our
legacy systems.
Joe Zbiciak <jzbiciak@dal.asp.ti.com> and I had this discussion not too
long ago on l-k ("Re: Bug in fat-fs code: file date/time wrong"); he
feels a lot more strongly than I do about the timezone semantics.  His
conclusion was that the real solution to all this is to port ext2 to
the legacy systems....
