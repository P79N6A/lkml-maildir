Never, to be more exact. Concurrent accesses are allowed only with rtnetlink.
In 2.4 it is always exclusive, because shared access turned out to
be mostly useless.

It is linux-2.2, guy. 8) "threads" are not threaded there.
Semaphores (rtnl_lock, particularly) protects only areas, which
are going to _schedule_ excplicitly or implicitly.

Please, read comments. People used to consider comments as something
decorative, but they are not. 
The first group of ioctls (no lock!):
		/*
		 *	These ioctl calls:
		 *	- can be done by all.
		 *	- atomic and do not require locking.
		 *	- return a value
		 */
The second group of ioctls (locked):
		/*
		 *	These ioctl calls:
		 *	- require superuser power.
		 *	- require strict serialization.
		 *	- do not return a value
		 */
Any questions?

Sorry...
/* NOTE: these locks are not interrupt safe, are not SMP safe,
 * they are even not atomic. 8)8)8) ... and it is not a bug.
etc.
Do you call this "very precautios"? 8)
I would say that I was absolutely careless about their atomicity
because it is useless before BKL has been removed.
