Any i386 or x86-64 machine can do suspend... It should be easy to get
some notebook... [What kind of hardware are you working on normally?]

It includes whitespace changes and most of patch is nice cleanup that
should probably go in separately. (Hint hint :-). 
Previous code had important property: try_to_freeze was optimized away
in !CONFIG_PM case. Please keep that.
Best way is to introduce macros and cleanup the code to use the
macros, without actually changing any object code. That can go in very
fast. Then we can switch to atomic_t ... yeah I think that's
neccessary, but I'd like cleanups first.
