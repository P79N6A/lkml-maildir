The tdb database is for storing current device information, udev needs to 
reference names to devices. The database also enables an api for applications 
to query what devices are on the system, their names, and their nodes. 
Using tdb has its advantages too; it's small, it's flexible, it's fast, it can 
be in memory or on disk, and it has locking for multiple accesses.
IMVHO - tdb isn't bloat.
Thanks,
Dan
