It's really a debugging tool where you normally don't care about
details like this. I wrote it to get visual feedback during kdump,
but it is nothing you should ever run during normal operation.
But I don't get how your patch is supposed to work. The blink driver
is not supposed to blink after panic -- panic does that anyways --
but always. So hooking it into the panic notifier chain which
is only called on panic makes about zero sense. 
If it's really needed to fix the wakeup issue the interface to
the keyboard blinking would need to be changed.
