If the file is bigger than MIN_READAHEAD * 2, we will want
to read in the file in multiple IOs anyway.
If it turns out that we read that file sequentially, then
the kernel will read in a LARGER CHUNK next time, if it
turns out that we aren't using the file sequentially, we
won't.
The point of chosing the MIN_READAHEAD * 2 cutoff is that
I want to avoid the N+1 problem, where we do an IO for the
first MIN_READAHEAD pages and have to do a separate IO for
the last 1 page...
regards,
Rik
