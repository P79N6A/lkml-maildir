Yes in paravirt_ops-hooks-to-set-up-initial-pagetable
Grr.  That is what I get for trying to avoid conflicts by working
against the -mm tree.
I thought that code had been like that for a while.  Since it hasn't
been merged upstream it looks to me like that patch needs to be fixed.
And we can keep HPA debugging patch.

Nope.  It's not overwriting anything.  I'm not at all convinced we
should preserve the Xen sillyness.  I'm not exactly against it,
but it adds complexity to already complex code.

We will have to see.  Currently the paravirt pagetable setup clashes
horrible with actually running a kernel on real hardware.
Color me not impressed by the paravirt mess.
