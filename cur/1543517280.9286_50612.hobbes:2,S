  Hi, all. Version 144 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This work has been sponsored by SGI.
This is against 2.3.29. Highlights of this release:
- Ported to kernel 2.3.29
- Removed calls to <devfs_register> from cdu31a, cm206, mcd and mcdx
  CD-ROM drivers: generic driver handles this now
- Moved joystick devices to /dev/joysticks
				Regards,
					Richard....
