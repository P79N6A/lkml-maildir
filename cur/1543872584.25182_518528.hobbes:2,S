	1) I start a new document
	2) add some text, "save as" it to config1.txt
	3) make more text
	4) choose File,Exit - prompts me to save
(perhaps not to .config, but instead config1.txt, but at least, it prompts
me, and gives me the choice to go back into menuconfig and save it under a
different name). So what I just wanted to make clear is that you don't
lose any changes without explicitly saying Don't Save.

Whether the 'working config file path' should change when you do
'Save as Alternate' or not, is a menuconfig axiom. Ask Sam Ravnborg
if you want it changed :-)
[ I see where you are going. I am not biased to either because I usually
  only use it to save to .config. ]
